And unlike, say, Austen or Bronte, there's nothing deeper here:  just a whole bunch of adultery.  In Galsworthy's mind, there is apparently no such thing as love flourishing when it is permitted to do so:  to him, the only real love is forbidden love.One of the things I found infuriating was that the swelling violin music was implying that you're supposed to be sympathizing with the screwball adulteress, Irene, whereas when I was watching it, I was siding with the supposedly evil Soames the whole time.  From time to time he behaved dishonorably, I agree, but I felt that he was far more sinned against than sinning, and that he was the film's true hero.Alas!  The filmmakers didn't seem to agree and kept trying to get me to hate him, which rubbed me the wrong way through the film's length.And the director apparently never met a close-up he didn't like.",N/A
1016909,"The time is late 1948 and the setting is a U.S. Army post in Georgia, bordering on a forest preserve...A Southern amoral wife called Leonora (Elizabeth Taylor) finds a way for her stream desire in an adulterous affair with Lt. Col. Langdon (Brian Keith), carried on almost openly...Leonora gives aperture to her forcefulness and vigor in a passion for horses and riding... She is attached to a handsome white horse she calls Firebird and she provokes her husband by telling him that the animal is indeed a stallion with the emotional nature of man...Leonora's husband (Marlon Brando) is a devious, insecure, impotent Army major, a hidden homosexual preoccupied with an unsociable, lonely rider who canters around the field in the nude and whose sexual emotional stress is diminished, secretively, at the bedside of the major's wife holding her clothes and looking fixedly at her marvelous hot body...Private Williams (Robert Forster) is another lonely man fascinated by the fiery Leonora and her thoughtful and gentle comments to him... He takes to visiting the Penderton house at night looking attentively in the windows, observing with total recall and complete joy Leonora's nakedness, but also watching the Major in his study...Keith's neurotic wife (Julie Harris) is well aware of her husband's affair with Leonora but she only feels well from her close friendship with her houseboy, Anacleto (Zorro David), an affected companion who shares her penchant for the arts and is in every way the opposite of her abrupt, strong husband...Flavored with bitter insinuations and insulting sarcasms, Brando and Taylor's few scenes have enough flames to burn the silver screen... He's a tormented human being while she's delicious but shrill and insensitive... Aware of her physical beauty she fights back when she's rejected, instigating him with her impudent, insolent, shameless manner that offend his very being...",The Marlon Brando Collection: (Julius Caesar / Mutiny on the Bounty 1962 / Reflections in a Golden Eye / The Teahouse of the August Moon / The Formula )
1265655,"Both torture-porn AND a morality tale (killing is BAD!) (yep, that's the message) this film becomes downright silly (complete with glowing demon eyes and a heavy-handed lesson) and throws away an intriguing premise.  Rife with hilarious dialogue (on approaching a farmhouse after a car accident a young couple has this exchange: Him: I hope someone's home.  Her:  Yeah, me too.) and acting replete with serious, slow delivery, this film can only be described as a complete time-waster.",Farm House

341171,"The 1984 Rosi film is a brillant and beautifilly photographed version of what is probably the best known opera.  A terrific way to introduce a novice to this musical form with wonderful performances by Placido Domingo and the very earthy and sexy Julia Migenes-Johnson.  A film classic that is sadly out-of-print in the U.S.Now, about those outrageously priced collectors copies to which there is a resonable alternative.  For less than the price of several of the used copies, it is possible to buy an all-region DVD player from Amazon for around $100-$125. Then you purchase a region 2 copy of Carmen from Amazon's U.K. service.  You'll get the same great movie for $34.99 and have the ability to play DVDs from around the world.  An added advantage is that the region 2 import of Carmen is anamorphic, providing a better picture than the grossily overpriced U.S. edition.Carmen is a tremendous film, but $175.00 for a used copy and $1495.00 for a factory-sealed edition?

1296994,"I won't go into depth on the details of the show - chances are that if you're thinking about this DVD you already know of the show and love it!I've been waiting years for a ""MAXX"" release on DVD, but I have to say I'm disappointed in this one. I can't say whether it's an issue with the show itself or the DVD, but the DVD is hard to watch at times. Aliasing (""Jaggies""), Rainbows and flickering are only some of the problems, but they're very noticeable and obvious throughout. Other problems popping up have been pixelation and color banding. The show just doesn't look nearly as good as it should have - it actually seems like a low resolution video (320x240?) being blown up to fit the screen without any cleanup or remastering (almost as if they just decided to ""throw it out there""). The CG parts being much worse (more obvious) than the animated parts. I would say it looks better than the VHS I had years ago, but not the jump in quality you would expect on DVD (and the VHS was released 13 1/2 years ago!). I would give the video quality about a 6.5/10 by todays standards.The disc DOES have a few extra features (interviews, commentary and a recap episode) - while not much, having commentary on each episode is great (I havent had a chance to listen to this yet - the  commentary is by Sam Kieth (Creator), Gregg Vanzo (Director), Claudia Katz (producer), Seth Kearsley (storyboards/character layouts)). The interviews, while also a great feature, disappointingly seemed to be in non-anamorphic widescreen (4:3 letterboxed).Also disappointing is the ""Burn on demand"" part of this product. While the packaging and labels are professional like any other store-bought DVD, these come on blue-backed discs (much like any DVD-R you can buy in stores) - the downside are that these don't last as long as professional pressed discs. Another big downside is that on my first set, the 2nd disc was badly scratched (if you've ever had a spindle of DVD-Rs, you've probably come across some that just look to be in terrible condition - that's how this one was). The replacement copy was much better, but the first disc had a few light scratches but also fingerprints on the bottom of the disc right out of the box. It just doesn't seem like much quality control went into these.Overall a great show that I have to recommend as this is the only DVD available. I would have liked to see it be remastered in some way, but unfortunately that's just not the case here. The DVD extras are great, the bonus content is great, but the video appears poor on a 24"" widescreen monitor (upscaled to 1080p by the PS3) - the effect was much worse watching on a 50"" TV. SDTV will probably look fine, but this show just wasn't  meant for the type of displays we use nowadays.",N/A
850973,I watched this series based on Amazon recommendations.  The series reminds me of a long string along movie where you hope it gets good but doesn't and then has a big let down ending.  There is some interesting sex parts and lots of twisted love triangles but that was all it had good.  The entire first season was slow to get the plot going.  Overall a big let down.  Would not buy the season or bother to watch it or recommend it to anyone.  Stephen King's  The Stand was better than this series with a similar plot of good vs evil.,Carnivale: Season 1
1158926,"Out of all of the performances by female actors with marquee names (so my personal favorite, Melissa Leo is immediately excluded), only in the case of Angelina Jolie did I ever manage to become so immersed in the film that I actually lost sight of the actor's celebrity status.  Winslet disrobes - often, Streep brings nothing new as the manchurian rendition devil wearing a habit and Hathaway has smeared mascara.  As the manipulated, distraught and aggrieved single mother, Christine Collins, Jolie embodies the essence of any parent's primary concern, in any era.Changeling is based on a true story of child abduction in ""flapper"" era Los Angeles with emphasis on the corruption within the police force and mayoral office that precluded any genuine effort to meet the actual needs of the constituency. Initially, Collins' pleas for responsiveness are ignored. Only after the authorities recognize an opportunity to use her in the effort to partially rehabilitate their public image does she find any level of assistance. When a child is identified that generally fit the description of her missing son, he is brought to L.A. and immediately, she realizes the child in front of her is not her biological son. In the prevailing environment the police, most noticeably the detective in charge of her case, Captain J.J. Jones, have no intention of allowing parental instinct - or forensic evidence - derail their haphazardly tracked locomotive to a potential partial restoration of public trust. She eventually finds an ally/advocate in the person of Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), an activist minister who had been on the campaign to clean up L.A.'s corrupt political and governmental entities.For me, Clint Eastwood's direction has been often hit or miss, I have a personal preference for films where he stays behind the camera instead of in front of it although I acknowledge Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby run contrary to that view.  Changeling is an impressive directorial effort, notwithstanding a meandering parallel courtrooms segment at the latter stages of the film that could just as well been edited out of the final version.",Changeling Theatrical Release

1230623,"I saw Eden Log recently for the first time, and was so into it I almost immediately ordered a copy on DVD. While I understand that the Blu-ray version has technical shortcomings, my review here relates to the content of the film, both thematically and stylistically.I don't want to give much away, because Eden Log does a great job of slowly unraveling a mysterious story over the course of the film. Toward the end when most things become revealed, I really had that ""Aha!"" moment you get when you realize a great puzzle was being untangled all throughout a story, and the clues that were there all along you were only vaguely understanding. For this reason I think the film merits multiple viewings.The style is very dark and ""dingy"", fairly cyberpunk, but from the sub-sub-sub-basement of a futuristic kind of world perspective. If you've read the Japanese manga series Blame! you will find many similarities to Eden Log. Likewise, the movie borrows from the stylings of French BD sci-fi comics, and this is a great thing, as not enough films do! Perhaps similar in a sense to Immortal by Enki Bilal, which of course itself was his adaptation of his own BD comic.Eden Log definitely is operating on several levels, in addition to the science fiction story itself. It is concerned with the environment and the planet, and how we as humans interact with and seek to control it, and create a feedback loop of negative consequences. It also has themes relating to immigration theory and nationalism/citizenship, and what some people do in order to pursue the dream of being a productive member of a ""free"" and prosperous society -- when in reality this is not what they are necessarily signing up for upon applying for citizenship. Other interesting themes abound as well, and because of all these subtleties I think this movie appeals more to an intellectual crowd.Stylistically, I am extremely impressed by what the filmmakers pulled off with a presumably relatively small budget. Camera work, set design, and costume design are all EXCELLENT, and all serve to illustrate the ""darkness"" of the world of Eden Log. I am impressed by the acting, and even creature design. The movie is very dark, the colors very muted and affected, and the camera work jarring -- but it's all very intentional, and the overall effect I found very appealing.So, maybe Eden Log won't appeal to your average Joe looking for a generic sci-fi horror action thriller -- but that's not the intent of this movie. I'd call it hard science fiction of a very artistic/stylized fashion, with intellectual social themes as an undercurrent. If you like artsy, gritty, dark, heady science fiction, absolutely give this movie a chance.",Eden Log

1230861,"When I was in kindergarten I taped every episode of X-MEN when it came on Fox on Saturday mornings.  It became my favorite show, even though I'd never read the comics.After a couple years I kind of lost track of what was happening on the show.  It's been quite a while since I watched the series, but a handful of story arcs have stuck out in my memory.  To my delight, all of these highlights were included in the 2-disc Volume 1 collection:""Night of the Sentinels"" and ""Enter Magneto"", the first (and introductory) episodes; ""The Cure"", where mutants journey to Muir Island in hopes of being made ""normal""; ""Come the Apocalypse"", the follow-up where Apocalypse and his four horsemen try to destroy the world; and ""Days of Future Past"", with Bishop going back in time to prevent an assassination.  This volume also contains the episodes where Mr. Sinister ruins Cyclops' and Jean's wedding, a story I remember only vaguely from my fuzzy VHS tapes.  So, for me, this set is almost all I need and it'll keep me happy for the time being.The DVD itself is a little disappointing, but not surprisingly so.  The two discs contain only the episodes, with no special features whatsoever.  But it's the episodes that are important, so...X-MEN is '90s-tastic.  There's no mistaking when this series aired.  It looks dated, but that just adds to the nostalgia factor.  The animation isn't anything special, but I think most people would watch the show for the action-packed storytelling.This DVD is primarily for nostalgia buffs and comic book fans.  Older viewers who are new to the series likely won't enjoy it as much as those of us with so many childhood memories tied to it.  But I think the show might be okay for kids, if they're young enough not to be distracted by its dated look.

126313,"This film reminds me a lot of one of my other all-time favourite movies ""Being There"" starring the comedic genius Peter Sellers but it is even more than that as it incorporates themes present in the outlandish myths of the tales of Paul Bunyon stretching the imagination with amusing whoppers all done so expertly interweaving important social and political issues spanning the 50's to the 80's coinciding with the growth of one simpleton Forrest Gump from childhood to adulthood.  The screenplay is excellent but what makes this film work so well is how well it handles the other major aspects of film-making such as sound effects, cinematography, lighting let alone the usual acting and directing that most people are familiar with.  If you look at this film from a purely technical aspect, this on all accounts is an excellent film and will certainly age very well over the years.  In fact I wouldn't be surprised to see this climb subtantially up any list of best films of all time as more and more people appreciate just how great this film is.Without being judgemental, this film manages to remind us of important historical events in a humourous manner also without being disrespectful of the subject matter.  There are many themes here but I liked the Lt Dan sub-story the best about how a person finds redemption and peace with himself and his faith.  The overall theme which addresses the question of whether life is a series of chance occurrences or the work of an invisible hand I found to be very interesting and is what will make this film as timeless as the answer to this central theme of this great movie.The second disc of extras which includes documentaries and interviews is very well done and the main disc has excellent picture (except for white spots in a few frames) and sound quality coming in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround options.Great film, great picture and sound quality and great extras make this a great addition to your movie library.Highly recommended!",N/A

852459,"This is a very strange character omission from this movie,  In Greek mythology, Cassandra also known as Alexandra was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy. Her beauty caused Apollo to grant her the gift of prophecy. However, when she did not return his love, Apollo placed a curse on her so that no one would ever believe her predictions.In an alternative version, she spent a night at Apollo's temple, at which time the temple snakes licked her ears clean so that she was able to hear the future. This is a recurring theme in Greek mythology, though sometimes it brings an ability to understand the language of animals rather than an ability to know the future.Apollo loved Cassandra, and when she did not return his love, he cursed her so that her gift would become a source of endless pain and frustration. In some versions of the myth, this is symbolized by the god spitting into her mouth; in other Greek versions, this act was sufficient to remove the gift so recently given by Apollo, but Cassandra's case varies. From the play Agamemnon, it appears that she made a promise to Apollo to become his consort, but broke it, thus incurring his wrath: though she retained the power of foresight, no one would believe her predictions. Telephus, the son of Heracles, loved Cassandra but she scorned him and instead helped him seduce her sister Laodice.While Cassandra foresaw the destruction of Troy (she warned the Trojans about the Trojan Horse, the death of Agamemnon, and her own demise), she was unable to do anything to forestall these tragedies since they did not believe her.Coroebus and Othronus came to the aid of Troy out of love for Cassandra. Cassandra was also the first to see the body of her brother Hector being brought back to the city.At the fall of Troy, she sought shelter in the temple of Athena, where she was violently abducted and raped by Ajax the Lesser. Cassandra was then taken as a concubine by King Agamemnon of Mycenae. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clytemnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.I know to fit this story in with Troy would have been impossible but nonetheless, this woman should have been involved in this movie! It's Hectors sister for goodness sake!Now just as Achilles has his heel, We have ""The Cassandra Effect"" now the Cassandra effect is when a person believes he or she knows the future happening of a catastrophic event, having already seen it in some way, or even experienced it first hand; however, the person knows there is nothing that can be done to stop the event from happening and that nobody will believe it even if he or she tries to tell others. For example, in finance, the more you warn your colleagues about the tail risks--the rare but devastating events that can bring the bank down--the more they roll their eyes, give a yawn and change the subject.

813636,"They will not see a single dime on this.  People that are into Blu Ray typically are more invested in their entertainment than those that only buy DVD's. It is not a knock on DVD buyers but rather just that if you dropped the cash for the Blu Ray player and the extra money on the disks then chances are you also have a TV and sound system to get the max value from your investment. Now I know a lot of people that also invest like that but still only use a DVD player. The difference is that a much higher percentage of those into Blu Ray go all out to those only into DVD's.With that said, the Blu Ray community expects more for their investment. After spending a small fortune for their entertainment center, they want the best products with all the bells and whistles. For Lord of The Rings to come out just plain jane with nothing extra and knowing full well that the ""GOOD"" version will be released at a laster date, we have a right to be upset.And to those that say these reviews are not valid, I disagree.

1120889,"This was my first workout with Patricia Mareno as an instructor, and I have to say that, overall, I am very pleased.  I tried this workout yesterday, and was impressed with how easy the moves were, but how she really keeps the energy going with these simple moves.  There are four main workouts on this DVD, as other reviewers have already explained, and they are all very solid.  Here's the breakdown:The good:1) This is a nice cardio workout for the most part.  It is low-impact (no jumping or plyo moves), and it is nice to see a low-impact workout still raise your heart rate effectively.  If you're in reasonable shape, this workout isn't going to make the sweat pour off you, but that doesn't necessarily mean the workout isn't doing what it should.2) Moves are simple, for the most part, and easy to pick up.3) The emphasis on the core and how to correctly hold your core was very nice to me, and told me a lot about why I developed some injuries in the past in my lower back.  Instruction on that was very helpful.4) The instructor takes the time to show you a slower form of the move first, and actually lets you practice the move before she speeds it up.5) I was feeling this workout all over by the time I went to bed--it really works your entire core, if you listen to her instructions on what to do with your belly, shoulders, etc.  Great workout if you want to confuse those muscles and break out of a routine.Needs improvement:1)I did not find her cueing to be as effective as it could have been.  It was better than most instructors, but there were times when I would have appreciated her calling out the moves more often BEFORE they changed.  This would be very helpful for when she is putting together all the individual moves into combos.2) No modifications were shown for the moves.  With four people behind her, you'd think at least one of them could have been shouted a reminder to show a modified move!3) Even though this is low-impact, there are some twisting moves that are had on the knees if you have bad knees.  Also, during the first two workouts you're pretty much standing in horse/warrior stance the entire time.  This got a little irritating on my hip joints.Some minor annoyances:1) Did ANYONE else find the one guy behind her to look a little disturbing?  His poofy hair kept distracting me, and it looked like he wandered onto the set and they put him in the video.2) Nowhere on the DVD packaging does it tell you the length of each of the workouts.  (If it's there, someone please tell me where!)  I like to know how long segments are so I can plan my workouts.Overall, I really liked the workout and the instructor.  I will definitely be putting this workout in my rotation.",Kickbox - Core Cross Train

1226517,"This is going to sound strange, but I think the reason I liked ""Slaughter"" is because it's not an endless succession of gore. This will probably disappoint some, and I agree that the title is very misleading; it's not a sleazy exploitation film, but a slow, tense psychological drama that actually bothers to tell a story. Granted, it's not very plausible, and I have a hard time buying into the fact that it was ""inspired by true events."" But what it lacks in credibility it makes up for in both style and character development. It a deliberately paced film, director Stewart Hopewell opting to let the story unfold gradually before letting the final twenty minutes or so go at full speed. This doesn't always work, but here it allows the audience to take everything in, especially when it comes to the dialogue given to the two leads; I won't give you a list of quotes, but if you pay attention, you'll notice that what they say to each other is ultimately very telling.The tension builds as a direct result of the opening credit sequence, which uses clever camera angles and lighting effects to reveal that an injured, bound woman is being dragged through a field. When the woman and her abductor arrive at a dock, the abductor ties a cinderblock to the woman's ankles and pushes her into a lake. If you think I just gave away a crucial plot point, think again; there's more to ""Slaughter"" than meets the eye.That's when the story slows down and backtracks. We're introduced to Cathy (Antonia Bernath), a young woman who just left her abusive boyfriend to start a new life in Atlanta. One night, she and her friend, Faith (Amy Shiels), celebrate at a local nightclub; out of the corner of her eye, Cathy notices another young woman who looks like she's being hassled by a man. She intervenes on her behalf, and the two immediately strike up a friendship. Here enters Lola (Lucy Holt), who lives on a farm just outside the city with her father and brothers. She appears to be in a desperate situation, unfulfilled on the farm and hated by her father, especially after the untimely death of her mother some years earlier. She claims she would like nothing more than to get out of Georgia and go far, far away. She vents her frustrations by acting promiscuous, constantly throwing herself at older, rich men, manipulating them into giving her gifts like watches.Cathy likes Lola a great deal, but it's obvious that she doesn't completely understand her odd behavior. She's friendly around Lola, but she's also careful, especially since she's in such an unfamiliar environment. Everything about the farm seems open and welcoming ... except for the slaughterhouse at the bottom of the hill, where Lola's father (David Sterne) spends a great deal of time. One of the reasons it's so frightening is because, for most of the film, it's closed off from Cathy. For a time, the loud squealing of pigs are the only indications that anything is happening.One could make a case for the pigs relating to Cathy's ex, who has constantly been trying to call her. That might be a stretch, however, simply because the symbolism is obvious. There are so many shots of pigs in this film that they have to serve as a metaphor for something. One could make a case for the pigs relating to Cathy's ex, who has constantly been trying to call her on her cell phone. That might be a stretch, however, simply because the symbolism is obvious. It's more likely that it has something to do with the men in Lola's life, but I can't elaborate on that since too much would be given away. Let it suffice to say that Lola hasn't had the best male role models.Eventually comes the climactic moment when Cathy finally enters the slaughterhouse and discovers a room hidden way in the back, which contains a vacant chair and a locker full of shoeboxes. To describe more would ruin both the suspense and a plot twist that seems expected but somehow manages to be surprising nonetheless. What's interesting is that, in spite of the twist functioning at a level appropriate to horror movies, it's doesn't evoke that same sense of outrageousness other such stories are known for--shocking, but not altogether over the top. We've spent a lot of time with the main characters at this point, which, for reasons I won't reveal, helps a great deal during the film's final minutes.The ending is perhaps too downbeat, and the final shot is heart wrenching in its uncertainty. There is, however, a sickening feeling that it couldn't have turned out any other way, which, if you see this movie, you will find both frightening and sad. Despite being advertised as a dime-a-dozen horror film, ""Slaughter"" delivers on a level more compelling than what the genre promises. Under different circumstances, it probably could have been widely released as a dark crime drama. That's not very good news for the horror movie fans that were enticed by the title, and if you're one of those people, I'm sorry to tell you that ""Slaughter"" is not going to be what you expected. But if you're looking for a carefully paced thriller with strong characters, you just might get your money's worth.",Slaughter: After Dark Horrorfest III

295832,"After seeing the earlier charming Errol Flynn versions and the later Kevin Kostner disaster I stumbled onto this version by accident on the Fox Movie Channel one evening and was blown away. Being a student of British medieval history for decades I was first struck by the authenticity of the costumes and settings representing the general period between the 13th and 15th centuries, the era of the earliest written and folklore references to Robin Hood. Unrecorded versions of the legend could have existed even earlier, perhaps the early 1200's or before. Legends usually exist long before they are written down.The earliest known clear written references appear in Piers the Plowman in the late 1300's. They depict Robin Hood as a yeoman, a commoner of the same approximate social status as an artisan such as a potter, miller, or bow maker. Writers and bards seem to have elevated him to the rank of nobleman much later, at the end of the 16th century, giving him the title of Earl of Huntingdon. A Robert Locksley no doubt existed, but his connection with the much older Robin Hood legend is pure fantasy.Despite many attempts scholars have been unable to connect Robin Hood with an actual historic person, although the legend might have been originally inspired by an actual person, as is often the case with legends and folklore.Friar Tuck seems to have existed in seperate legends even earlier than Robin Hood and appears to have been merged into the Robin Hood legend later. The earliest eight or more known Robin Hood written verses make no mention of either Friar Tuck or Maid Marion.Maid Marion appears later still, in the early 1400's, well after the first known versions of Robin Hood and Friar Tuck appeared together in the same literary contexts.A definitive and scholarly discussion can be found on-line in Robin Hood, Wikipedia.The Danny Webb, Conrad Asquith, Barry Stanton, and Patrick Bergin depiction of Robin Hood was produced in the U.K. and is about as authentic as it can get. No cleanly pressed forest green tights and feathered green caps worn on neatly combed hair. The unwashed characters were dressed in appropriately dingy clothes, sometimes almost rags, as real commoners would have been dressed in that period. This is a ""dark"" film until the very last, when it concludes with a beautiful, bright, Art Nuveau ending.One scene depicted Robin and Marion briefly hiding in the loft of a small peasant house. It was dark and cramped, and the underside of the thatched roof could be seen almost touching their heads, just as it would have been in real life. The streets were muddy and domestic pigs and chickens roamed freely. Medieval celebration and processional costuming was well done in several scenes. There are just too many quality aspects of this film to cover in one evaluation.The acting was acceptable or better and some of the lines were actually  outstanding. The itenerant bowmaker with his trade cart in which Robin and Marion hid was a good example of well-written and well-delivered lines.All-in-all, criticisms of deviation from the ""original"" story are totally unfounded because there is no known original story. Over the centuries there have been many versions, none of which can be proven original. This version seems to be an amalgam of the very earliest surviving references to, and ballads of, Robin Hood, with Marion and a rather crude friar folded in for viewers who expect them and feel cheated if they aren't there.The primary conflict, which most modern formula film scripts demand, is in this instance the conflict between Normans and Saxons, especially between the nobles, rather than between the more traditional Robin and the Sheriff of Nottingham, a much later convention. Marion was there to satisfy the other formula requirement for inclusion of a love story.The film gave me the wonderful experience of witnessing life in 14th century Britain as it actually was. My only criticism is of the ending with the obviously contrived Politically Correct concession of ""we Saxons and Normans must all live in harmony together on this same little island."" ... Blah! ... They might as well have all held hands and sung Koombaya. Other than that it was an excellent movie, well written, well cast, well photographed, well acted, and except for the brief bit of nausious PC dialogue at the end, devoid of any hidden political agenda. Easily the best film version of Robin Hood, and well worth five stars.I was so impressed I bought the DVD.",N/A

618275,"We received this movie as a Christmas gift.  We attempted to watch it while the kids were watching another movie downstairs.  We forced ourselves to watch the first half hour before we decided it was so not worth our time and the title had nothing to do with the movie - except for the first scene, at the airport.The great line up of performers gave us false hope in thinking this was going to be an entertaining movie.  The lack of storyline listed on the back cover should have been our first red flag.Some of the storylines could have been made into something worth watching - like the stepfather/stepson relationship or maybe even the Prime Minister and his secretary. But because they jump around between so many storylines (mostly shallow and self-serving, oh, and don't forget the porn dropped in for what, shock affect?) it was way too difficult to make sense of any of it.  Porn is not our thing and has NOTHING to do with love, neither does a guy who thinks he's a sex-god but constantly complains he can't get a girl.Whoever thinks this movie portrays LOVE has never experienced true and lasting love.  This distorted view of love is a major part of the reason our world is in the state it is in.  True love is about self-sacrifice and putting someone else before your own desires.  IF you actually want LOVE, in the true sense of the word this is the wrong place to find it.Love, actually, has nothing to do with this movie.  Hard to believe but Wall-E is a better romantic comedy.  At least the two robots put each other first and take care of each other.  The kids had the better entertainment option for the night.

1207813,"Chronicling the life of English journalist George Hogg during WWII, ""The Children of Huang Shi"" attempts to show the atrocities faced by the Chinese people during the Japanese occupation of the country in the early stages of the war.Hogg (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an ambitious (albeit naive), young journalist trying to get to Nanjing. Under the guise of a Red Cross worker, he gains entrance, but quickly finds out this assignment will test all of his survival skills. His journalist peer (David Wenham) is killed, Hogg is stranded in Nanjing with an extremely aggressive (and murderous) force of Japanese soldiers, and to top it off, he is captured with the evidence of the atrocious behavior of the Japanese (killing of innocent villagers-men, women and children).It is only the fortuitous presence of a Chinese Nationalist (played with tremendous credibility by Chow Yun-Fat) that Hogg eventually escapes, making his way to an orphanage, partially looked after by Lee Pearsons (played with a lack of credibility by Radha Mitchell-a fine actress, but not her brightest hour). Befriending the boys-scared, lonely, starving, and diseased-isn't Hogg's easiest task, but he manages to convey a strong sense of self in the children, aided by Merchant Wang's (Michelle Yeoh) advice and supplies.Upon learning of the Japanese army's advancement into the orphanage territory, and knowing the boys could be conscripted at any time, Hogg decides to make the dangerous, 700 mile trek through the famous `Silk Road' (of Marco Polo fame). This is where this epic film should have risen to the occasion, with grandeur and wide-angle scope, but there is a definite disconnection with the viewer of the hardship faced by Hogg, Lee, and the children. The time feels shortened and compressed during the most challenging portion of the film, and when Hogg succumbs to tetanus, one feels cheated.""The Children of Huang Shi"" had much potential, but fell a little flat overall. A 2.5 star effort, worth at least one viewing for a story many in the States are unaware of.",The Children of Huang Shi

The story involves a parent's worst nightmare, so I would expect moms and dads to be particularly horrified. The movie manipulates, no doubt being overdone here and there, but it's generally effective.Angelina Jolie does a superb job of portraying a Los Angeles woman (""Christine Collins"") in the late 1920s whose boy is kidnapped. Five months later, the ""proud"" police department brings her kid back, making it a good PR session. Unfortunately, it's not her kid and stupidly, although she's naturally upset about, she poses with the kid and takes him home. (Would that really happen?). Then she begins her quest of finding her real ""Walter.""Further twists and turns make the story increasingly horrifying. In all, you won't be able to keep your eyes off the screen wondering if justice will ever prevail in the end and who exactly is involved in what. It's not particularly a fun ride - you'll have a frown on your face for quite some time - but it sure is interesting and an excellent two hour-plus of entertainment. By the end, you'll be emotional exhausted.Kudos to all the actors in here for riveting performances and to the production and design team for a great period piece.

250021,"What has THE THIN MAN wrought? True, other madcap mysteries had arrived to cinema before Nick & Nora Charles's oh so memorable debut, but it was THE THIN MAN series which propelled this sub-genre into prominence. Anyway, THE MAD MISS MANTON came along in 1938, and was one of the better variations on the theme. It paired Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda for their first of three films, with THE MAD MISS MANTON considered by many as a sort of dress rehearsal for their later screwball classicThe Lady Eve - Criterion Collection(the third film they co-starred in is YOU BELONG TO ME).The plot: Late one night, while walking her dog, Park Avenue heiress Melsa Manton espies a corpse. The police arrive in ten minutes, but in the interim the corpse vanishes. Thing is, Melsa and her flighty high society gal pals had garnered a reputation around the city as prankish merry makers (all for the cause of charity, the girls declare), and now the police believe that this is only the latest antic being pulled by Melsa. A newspaper editor sends out a blistering editorial condemning Miss Manton and accusing her of a murder hoax. In the face of the police's naked disbelief and the newspaper's disregard, Melsa Manton takes it upon herself to unearth the corpse and solve the murder mystery. Never mind that she's promptly threatened with an anonymous note and a knife on her door. Oh, and she also sues the paper for libel.Rumor has it that Henry Fonda didn't care at all for his part, but he turns in a professional performance anyway. This film is more a vehicle for Barbara Stanwyck, an actress who really could do it all. Except that Stanwyck is such a ferocious and intelligent actress that even her version of the screwball dizzy dame can't help but demonstrate smarts and a sense of solidity. Fonda, on the other hand, loses some man cred by getting beaten and tied up by eight lovely society debs. THE MAD MISS MANTON is breezy and farcical and sets a very brisk pace. Things are hopping in this film. Even the mystery is staged so that it doesn't feel like a throwaway plot device. And perhaps the reason Fonda so detested his newspaper editor role is because of his character's churlish behavior with the fair sex. He tells Stanwyck's character: ""You are a nasty creature, aren't you? But in time I'll beat it out of you."" And later on: ""Go away! You bother me!"" His comments tend to come off as more mean than the police lieutenant's terse ""Shaddup!"" Still, it's Henry Fonda whom Stanwyck ends up with, so go figure. But I really prefer their chemistry in THE LADY EVE.For fans of GONE WITH THE WIND, Hattie McDaniels appears as Melsa Manton's uppity servant and she delivers several good one-liners. Sam Levene has his moments as the often irritated, pill-popping (for his ailing stomach), much put-upon police lieutenant. THE MAD MISS MANTON is also a mini-study in how to stage group shots as, for a huge chunk of the picture, Miss Manton is surrounded by her bevy of belles, all of them stunners and dressed up to the nines and in the latest trends of the late '30s. I guess you can try to differentiate among the seven debs, but none of them really stand out. I did like one politically-minded girl's (I forget which one) running exchange. She seems to think that every suggested group activity is tantamount to a communist act. There's one scene in which the girls come upon the killer holding a gun to Melsa's head:- one girl states: ""If you kill her, you'll have to kill all of us.""- You know who: ""Oh, you're always talking communism!""",Mad Miss Manton VHS

481955,"I was a little disappointed with this movie, but I suspect my expectations were set too high based on some glowing reviews that led me to buy it.  However, it's the kind of movie I think I'll appreciate more on repeat viewings (it is very long, there are many characters to keep track of - often in different costume, making it hard to remember who's who - and many subtleties to pick up on).  It bore resemblance to other movies about musical genius (Amadeus, especially in the opening and conducting scenes; Immortal Beloved and Copying Beethoven - all great movies to emulate, by the way).The movie felt a bit choppy, and I watched many scenes wondering what they contributed to the story and why they were included.  It's almost as if someone thought ""let's include this!  Oh, and let's include that!,"" but then these disparate vignettes weren't stitched together very well to make them flow better, and the result was an overly long movie that leaves you with many questions.  There seemed to be too much unnecessary detail at times, yet not enough at others.  Basically, the movie could have benefited from better editing, both for length and content.  To give one glaring example, Sullivan was adamant in refusing to write any more music for comic operas and steadfast in his desire to write serious ones.  This stumbling block between the two geniuses was noted over and over.  Yet, Sullivan seems to miraculously come around and embrace The Mikado, giving up on his serious objections to the genre.  By what process did that transformation happen when he was so stubborn earlier?  This is central to the story and yet is not really explained aside from one scene where Sullivan apparently likes the new libretto (but why when it's not much different from the others???).Having done all that nitpicking, I must say this film has many pluses - not the least of which is the beautifully rendered music, the extended live performance numbers, the great singing (which some have complained about but I found it marvelous and highly recommend the soundtrack), the opulent costumes, magnificent sets and excellent cast.  Visually it reminds me a bit of Moulin Rouge in its overall lushness.  The period setting is also of great interest (has anyone ever explored the pitfalls of the just-invented telephone before, or the marvel of the ""reservoir pen"" with its own ink?)Perhaps there is just too much going on in this movie to adequately absorb in one setting.  Therefore, I am watching it again - which, come to think of it, is pretty high praise for any movie.  So ultimately, I must recommend.  Eventually, you'll probably love it.",Topsy Turvy VHS

1190190,"I really, really wished someone else would have written this movie. There were a lot of things wrong with Terminator Salvation, but this is coming from a person who has watched the prior three installments and the television series. To the average young movie watcher who doesn't know the entire cast of characters in John Connor's story, this film will come off as a mediocre sci-fi action thriller with a confusingly weak story.Taking place after a Nuclear blast has wiped out much of the human race, John Connor (now a grizzled war vet) is one of the leaders of a revolutionary underground movement hell bent on taking back the earth from their machine masters. In the first two Terminator movies we are given a bit of history on this John Connor, how he loved people, how his selflessness and bravado was enough to make them forget their fears and fight back against the zerg. What I saw in Christian Bale's version of John Connor was a hardened loner-type, showing little to no emotion aside from the few times he was with his pregnant wife. This version did not feel like the leader we were made to believe led the revolution, he just lacked the sort of charisma that you would expect a guy like that to hold. He did not go through the ranks touching men on their shoulders and giving the fighters that reassuring eye to let them know he has their back... the tiny hints that a viewer looks for to confirm their belief that this man was their saviour, just weren't there. No, John seemed cold, too cold, his decisions were not democratic, his beliefs are dashed aside at a whim and he seems to have no recollection of his youth (Terminaor 2: Judgement Day) when a machine taught him to think and not allow blind hate to cloud his judgement. This John Connor has a deep hate for the machines and it is reinforced by an ancient tape recorder that plays his mother's instructions from the past. This wrong John Connor ruined it movie for me because he is the protagonist, yet his story, visage, and history are so wrong that it was hard to look past him and like the movie.The story of Terminator Salvation felt like the piecing together of three different scripts being that it started out very well and ended up going nowhere fast. In the past movies we were led to believe that Skynet was so advanced and powerful, the only way out for the human race was to send someone back in the past to stop it from even starting. The Skynet we see in this movie is advanced... at building cool machines and motorcycles (that lack any real AI). To recall Arnold's T-800 relentlessly doing detective work and searching for Sarah Connor in the first Terminator to seeing the T-600s in this movie (the obvious future of it all) walking blindly and being outsmarted by children, just didn't make sense whatsoever. Hell the explosions were pretty but I had absolutely no fear of the machine menace that ruled the world. This is not how I felt in the older movies. Remember how hopeless it seemed when the T-1000 chased the Connor family in T2, how it seemed nothing could stop it? It made you say to yourself, ""damn! How would you deal with 10 of those things if you can't even handle one in this movie!?"" Well somehow McG and crew forgot this tiny element because the dumb machines and clueless T-600 models are laughably bad at tracking anything.Through all the horrible and forgettable writing that plagued this letdown, the best parts were the scenes with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Not so much the chemistry, but the fact that they had the least annoying scenes in the entire thing. The action scenes which had Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and John Connor (Christian Bale) seemed to be full of the most unrealistic coincidences to fall in their favor. The story behind Marcus Wright was probably the most interesting and would have benefited the movie if they delved into his past a bit more. The conflict in screen time between him and Connor did not flow well and it would have been better if they stayed with him and ditched Connor altogether.In closing I will say that Terminator Salvation was pretty but lacking in substance, relevance and ultimately reason. There is nothing to be learned from this one and it neither wraps up the saga nor adds anything to it. The story was a huge waste of time and a disappointment. Moon Bloodgood was deliciously hot though... I will give it that... but only that.",N/A

The movie is based on the hit Jeannie C. Reilly song of the same name from 1968, written by ""The Storyteller"" himself, Tom T. Hall.

The film-makers seem to think their lame, predictable punch-line (I can't dignify it with the word 'twist') makes up for the rotten film preceding it.What in God's name is the woman playing Lois doing?

It's mainly the villains who turn in those pantomime performances.The voiceover says that sometimes people stay in terrible situations because they have nowhere else to go.

Without spoiling it for anyone who wants to watch it, here's my review:This time out, AMC gives us the answers. We find out how the scenes in The Village and New York are related. No need for us to come up with our own theories as to ""what's it all about?"" I found myself more interested in Number Two than Number Six. This Number Six doesn't seem very passionate about his desire to escape and I found myself not really caring if he did or not. The ending, although a possibility brought up in the final episode of the original series, completely ruined the mini-series for me.How The Village came to exist and how the inhabitants ended up there was quite a stretch for me. It definitely made this series more sci-fi than drama. I did enjoy the many nods to the original series, the updated Village wardrobe, Ian McKellen's performance, and the improved Rover.I can't see this series having the timeless appeal of the original, but perhaps a younger viewer would disagree with me.If you're a fan of the original, you'll probably watch this and be disappointed like I was.

JCVD has never looked cooler.  He's rocking a massive coif of 80s hair on the verge of a permullet, and he struts/walks in every scene like it looks good.  With a supporting cast of Ron Silver and Bruce McGill, Timecop registers as one of the better acted JCVD movies.  In addition, the script and pacing are better than the majority of most action blockbusters - there is real creativity in the story composition.  Exploring the spectacular concepts ofBack to the Futureand amplifying them, Timecop is superb on all levels.  Narrowly missing out on being the top JCVD movie of all time, any action or sci-fi fan should thoroughly enjoy this JCVD thriller.",N/A

I'm sorry, but his ego and cheesyness were actually what defined Styx.  I like his theatrics.  And he was the driving force in the early days (when the only hit they had was Lady).  If it wasn't for Dennis, I suspect Tommy wouldn't even be in the band!  And JY just might be ""flipping burgers"" to borrow an expression from another review.  They kicked him out of the band, so I'd say they're the one's with the egos, and now they play bars and fairs.  This is a reminder of what Styx WAS, and I think they made a huge mistake kicking him out: for better or for worse, cheesy factors and all- he was the leader and defining character of the band- and this shows it.",N/A

1238631,"After watching the live action movie of G.I. Joe Rise Of The Cobra(While a little entertaining but still a somewhat of a letdown) I felt the feelings of wanting to watch the cartoon version to bring back the true enjoyment of this series.  The animated series and the live action version of course differ greatly so if you're a fan of the cartoon series than you must pass the live action movie over or be prepared to be annoyed.  The cartoon version while lasting I think about 95 episodes was and will always be one of the most remembered shows of the 80's to live on. Watching as the JOES and Cobra would battle each other every episode or through multi-part story saga episodes was great and entertaining to watch and I was greatly saddened when the producers decided to cancel the show.  The cast for the JOES and COBRA were so numerous that it was easy for anyone to have their own personal favorite character for the show from Duke, Scarlet, Snake Eyes, Flint, and Lady Jaye to Cobra Commander and Destro and the Baroness.  The video quality of the box sets for this show was amazing considering the age of the show itself and while not picture perfect it still reaches close to that point and the audio is pretty decent as well no buzzing or annoyance to speak about.  Though for the price of these sets I say get the first season two box sets very affordable and with some pretty decent extras which I haven't seen all of them is still pretty good.  While some might not care for the animation especially those who've become to use to the cgi effects used with today's animated cartoons an the likes might not care for these earlier classics, but for those who grew up watching these cartoons or have seen them through reruns on cable here's a great catch for your home library today.  One thing though I would say is while they tried to make a new revival during the 90's that show I felt was sadly lacking the spark that the 80's version had and while they weren't bad the 90's version just didn't connect with me as the earlier series did so for fans of the 80's version just stick with these box sets and just pass over the 90's version....",N/A
1188005,"The final season of The Waltons finds the family in the grasp of World War II's final year. Now, all four sons are in the Army, with Ben taken POW by the Japanese. Meanwhile, his wife Cindy is living with the clan, taking care of their baby Virginia and dreading news of his fate, while daughter Mary Ellen decides to pursue med school, and daughter Erin continues her job as office manager at the factory. Youngest daughter Elizabeth, long considered the baby of the clan, is turning into a young woman, preparing to finish high school and thinking about her own future.Noticeably absent are Ellen Corby as Grandma (vaguely said to be off ""visiting"" all these long months) and Michael Learned as Mrs. Walton, said to be off at the VA hospital where she began volunteering when eldest son John-Boy came home gravely wounded. In reality, Learned had asked to be written off; yet on the show itself, her absence was poorly explained as the character continued to stay at the hospital long after John-Boy recovered and went back into the war -- missing numerous Walton special occasions such as youngest son Jim-Bob's high school graduation and all four boys marching off to war, occasions a mother certainly would not have missed, being a mere drive away.All throughout this season, it's clear -- both to viewers and the Walton family -- that life as the family knows it is changing irrevocably.Particularly memorable Season 9 episodes include the two-part ""The Outrage,"" where John struggles to clear the name of Harley, a black friend who was long ago charged with killing a white man; ""The Pursuit,"" when a obsessive girl arrives at the Walton home, claiming to be pregnant with Jim-Bob's baby; and ""The Last Ten Days,"" showing Ben's nightmarish experiences as a Japanese prisoner of war as the fighting begins to wind down, and the family is both optimistic about the war's end yet scared that Ben's angry captors might choose to kill him upon their defeat.No matter the show's shortcomings, The Waltons was and is, throughout its long run, a classic series. True to life, each episode is full of life-testing situations, warmth, faith and humor -- it will long be remembered and missed by countless fans.",N/A
1270444,"Arguably one of the dumbest films this year, and probably one of the biggest tanks this year (budget vs. revenue). But, Universal tried to make up for it here with a packed Blu catered to both the old series fans and Will Ferrell/Danny McBride followers.I will skip the content review as any competent review out there picks apart the million things wrong with this movie, so that leaves clarity, sound and supplements. The Blu clarity is as solid as can be from Universal, so with that comes the tons of shortcomings on the effects. Not your benchmark display test for an effects film; the stages come across fake, the green screen lines are prevalent but the dinos appear fairly realistic. The DTS gets TONS of usage so one can get some nice channel variances. The supplements are what give this 2 star film the extra bump.* 20:20 minutes of deleted scenes. For what this film became, most of these would have bored the kid audience and got cut; the first ten minutes are all character stuff with Ferrel's persona. The last few minutes would have been more closure on the love story angle. The McBride fans would only get one or two moments here of extra banter from him.* 11:00 minute Day in the Life of a movie star - Danny McBride. A camera crew follows him during a typical day at the set, including the usual fake banter between Ferrel and him, boring trailer tours, make-up sittings, etc.* 6:45 minute Devil's Canyon Tour. A great plug for the prop department as McBride takes you through all of the items in his store. More of the fake stuff between Ferrel/McBride on set.* 83 minutes making-of. Wow - was almost longer than the film. Covers every single aspect of production. Plenty of interviews, set pieces, set decoration, logistics, wardrobe - everything. Catered to the film-making crowd and buffs who like the looooong documentaries like this.* 23 minute Kroffts interview. A sit down with the both of them as they review everything about the original series and their associated works.* Director's commentary.* DBox enabled.I could not rate this higher (a five star) because of the poor content and listing of bad effects showing through on Blu. But the sound and volume of supplements (catering to a variety of followers) gives this entire package a good rating. I am a huge McBride fan and honestly feel his comedy is utilized way better inEastbound & Down: The Complete First Seasonthan this mess. Enjoy.",N/A
766436,"It is a mistake to say that Firefly is new or revolutionary, since its key ideas have been print SF staples for decades.  What Firefly is, is ambitious and audience-centered in a way little TV sci-fi has been since the original Star Trek.  It anticipates a smart audience and rewards them with humane, high octane stories about clever characters in sophisticated situations.  So naturally it got cancelled.Dare I say that the best thing about Firefly is that it's incomplete?  Only fourteen episodes were made, introducing a story lush with promise and an energetic ensemble immersed in the kind of work that most actors long for.  It is this promise, unsullied by later network interference, which I think makes this the best TV to hit DVD in years.Beyond the writing, acting, and direction, all of which are superb, this show has some of the best visual design I've seen in decades.  Joss Whedon studied how space flight takes place even now, and reflected the cramped quarters, austere living conditions, and blue-collar immediacy missing from more slick productions.  Firefly is the latest true embodiment of George Lucas' vision of ""used space.""Firefly didn't find its audience until it was out on DVD, but it's clear why this story inspires comic books, a feature film, fan fiction, and a massive fan culture despite its brief span.  For true believers in TV as art, this show sums up the promise that the medium rarely accomplishes.  Fun, funny, and energetic, there is no question why a cancelled show commands fan loyalty even several years later.",N/A
1126387,"2007's ""Beowulf"" is an animated film version of the epos featuring motion-capture technology which films real-life actors (Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Robin Wright Penn) and places them into the animated picture. Although this is a ""cartoon"" it's the equivalent of an R-rated picture, featuring ultra-brutal violence and open sexual situations & dialogue (BOTH the rated and unrated versions).The film has the same characters as the epic poem -- Beowulf, Hrothgar, Wiglaf, Grendel, Grendel's mother and the dragon -- and the three Acts split between Beowulf's fight with Grendel, Grendel's ""sea hag"" mother and the dragon; other than this the film strongly deviates from the classic poem. Needless to say, don't watch this if you're a Beowulf purist -- you'll be both offended and disappointed.However, if you don't mind the animation or a re-imagining of the epic story and enjoy sword & sorcery adventure like Conan, I recommend catching ""Beowulf."" It's both entertaining and thought-provoking. I recommend watching this version and 2005's ""Beowulf & Grendel"" back-to-back; the latter film is a live-action version featuring Gerard Butler in the titular role and filmed on the gorgeously bleak landscapes of Iceland (seriously, it's worth viewing just for the stunning location photography). This Gerard Butler version omits the third Act with the dragon and adds a Nordic witch character, effectively played by Sarah Polley.One of the main statements of the 2007 animated version is that the reality behind the story is much different than the legend, which has been embellished over the years. Some reviewers complain that Beowulf isn't a genuine hero in this version but this isn't true. He's a bold warrior who takes on the gargantuan and intimidating (not to mention UGLY) Grendel NAKED and somehow defeats him! He then goes on to lead a mighty Nordic kingdom for decades to come. If this isn't a hero, what is? Okay, so he exagerrates his past exploits and has a weakness for babes, what else is new?I should add here that, not only is this a beautiful film to look at, animated or not, it also has an excellent epic Viking-ish score by Alan Silvestri, highlighted by the main title (""What We Need Is A Hero"" -- Tracks 1 & 4 on the soundtrack cd) and the two versions of ""A Hero Comes Home"" (the first is the shorter/simpler version sung by Robin Wright-Penn whereas the second, sung by Idina Menzel, plays during the end credits).[SPOILER ALERT! The rest of this review explores the meanings behind the story and gives away important plot elements]I'll be honest with you, although I was entertained the first time I saw ""Beowulf"" I came away from it thinking ""Huh?"" This version makes King Hrothgar the father of Grendel and Beowulf the father of the dragon, making it absurd in a what-were-they-thinking way, but also highly creative. Whether you see it one way or the other -- or both -- depends on the individual and how you look at it.Viewing the picture a second time, I was intent on figuring it out and gleaning the moral(s) of the story. The main lesson, aside from the one noted above, is that new political leaders tend to make the same mistakes as past political leaders, so new leaders should be careful or they'll experience the same pitfalls.Other points include:- The mistakes of your past will inevitably come back to haunt you.- Apart from redemption, the ""sins of the fathers"" will cast a pall over the family or community and eventually come back to bite 'em (literally!).- Even the greatest heroes are human and have serious flaws.- Deal with and put to rest your past mistakes (sins) or the guilt & shame will drain the life from you and your environment; it'll also make you wish you were dead (see the final paragraph below).- Offer a man unlimited power, wealth and fame and he'll likely go for it no matter the cost, selling his soul to the devil, so to speak.- Men are easily entranced by a beautiful babe, regardless of how obviously impure her intentions.- A beautiful woman can turn a man into a loaf of bread.- The importance of saying you're sorry and forgiving; the importance and ultimate triumph of love.Some things to think about: Why is the dragon one-and-the-same as a noble-looking gold-skinned man? Does this signify he's a cross between malevolent blood and noble blood (mother and father respectively)? Is he able to morph back-and-forth at will? Is the golden man his spiritual side and the dragon his dark side?Some criticize that Beowulf is no longer a Christ-figure in this account, which isn't accurate. Although late in the story Beowulf mourns that there are no heroes in the new Christian era, only ""weeping martyrs,"" ironically he goes on to be an obvious type of Christ by sacrificing himself for the people of his kingdom (the world) by slaying the dragon (the devil). Keep in mind that, according to the Bible, all things were created through Christ, which would include the angel Lucifer, who later devolved into Satan. Likewise the golden man in ""Beowulf"" was created via Beowulf and is later revealed as a hideous dragon.All human types of Christ are flawed because humans are flawed, even ultra-heroes like Beowulf, which -- again -- is one of the main points of the film. Hence, Beowulf's perception about ""weeping martyrs"" is faulty and can be attributed to his fallen condition when making the statement (see below). Later, he rises out of the ashes to slay the dragon and sacrifice himself for the people. Right before doing this he declares his love for his wife and asks her to forgive him for his past failings.One scene had an impact on me. Years after becoming a king, Beowulf boldly confronts a defeated Frisian warrior who mocks him on the Nordic coastline. Beowulf commands his men to step back, discards his sword and challenges the warrior to kill him (at this point the Frisian has picked up his battle axe). Weaponless, Beowulf yells at him with every fiber of his being, ""KILL ME! DO IT! KILL ME! KILL ME!"" Why does Beowulf do this? Is he invunerable and, hence, has no fear of death? No, the ending proves he's wholly mortal. Actually he's so burdened by guilt and shame that he no longer even cares if he lives or dies. This is reality, my friend. Who would have expected this in a ""cartoon""?PERSONAL GRADE: B+",N/A
872304,"9 Souls (Toshiyaki Toyoda, 2003)The premise of 9 Souls will sound familiar to many Americans over, roughly, twenty-five years old, as it's very close to the premise of Michael Keaton's 1991 comedy The Dream Team. The differences are that the escapees come from prison, rather than from a mental institution, and that, as the title would suggest, there are nine of them rather than four. The movie also wants to play this conceit as straight drama rather than screwball comedy, and in many ways that's its biggest failing. After all, there are many parts of this movie that border on the humorous, and had they slipped over the edge, it might have turned this mediocre offering into a really enjoyable film. It never gets there.Toyoda (Hanging Garden) takes nine prisoners who find themselves in the same cell, has them plot to escape, do so, and then try to get back to something resembling normality while evading the cops. ""Normal"" differs for each of them; one finds solace in visiting a stripper for whom he'd performed an organ transplant some years before. One wants to get back to his fianc&eacute;e. Another simply wants to find employment in a dumpling shop. There's a subplot about one of the prisoners, a counterfeiter, promising the group untold riches after he leads them to the ""key to the universe"", but while that seems to have been the original driving force of the movie, it takes a backseat to the lives of these characters.I'm not saying 9 Souls is a bad movie. I'm just not sure it knows what it wants to be. It doesn't help that every major comparison I can come up with for it (all Japanese road movies, for example, put me in mind of the immortal Kikujiro) is a comedy, and so I keep coming back to the idea that this could have been a lot more lighthearted than it was. It's obvious Toyoda saw the potential for this, and a lot of the more dramatic scenes in the movie seem as if they would have had more weight had they been surrounded by a bit more humor. (I also don't want to make it sound like the movie is entirely humorless; it isn't, but it definitely aspires to high drama.) It's a decent movie, but one which feels like it could have been so much more. ***",9 Souls
1201268,"Okay, so the first two UNDERWORLD movies weren't gold; in fact, I didn't like the second one at all.  But at the least first was what you expected of it: pure popcorn entertainment, with dazzling special effects, little in the way of real acting, a predictable plot, and a bunch of action (with some gratuitous sex thrown in for good measure).  It's not gonna win Oscars, but damned if it will ever bore you.Well, UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS doesn't bore, either...but it's never what it could be.  Or, rather, what it SHOULD be.  We won't discuss the acting too much; Bill Nighy does the best with what he's given (talk about a great actor in a limited role), and Michael Sheen doesn't even seem to be trying much (can't blame him; watch FROST/NIXON to see this actor at his best).  Again, it's nothing to lament; you didn't expect Shakespeare, did you?  We even get the gratuitous sex, the dramatic violence, even a final ""hell yeah!"" moment between Sheen and Nighy.  And there's definitely a good story here, the clash between vampires and lycans.The main default here are the special effects, or lack thereof.  This movie seems like it was made in the 80s, mid-90s at best.  It's such a disappointment; with better effects, the movie would at least have been engaging to an extent.  As is, UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS can't even seem to muster up that main prerequisite of horror/action shlock: dazzling special effects.  Without that, it's little more than a film that we WISH was better than it is.",N/A
449563,"One of the greatest films of all time, GWTW is a fascinating depiction of Southern life during and after the Civil War.  This review, however, is for the product, not the film.  I give the product four out of five stars for the following reasons:1) This edition comes with many extras, even a recreation of the program used 70 years ago.  Also included is a sample of the original motion picture soundtrack and roughly eight hours worth of bonus features, including documentaries, commentary, and more.  While the product description mentions ten 5""x7"" water color pictures (which it does include), it also comes with recreated telegrams, letters and more from the cast, crew and production company.2) The film transfer is beautifully done.  The film flows smoothly and is featured on two DVDs.  While that is rather annoying, having to get up and change DVDs or wait as the player automatically shifts between the two, that sacrifice for the beauty of the film is well worth it.3) The price is rather high for what you get.  I love the film and had no problem paying the money for it, but the price is still rather high.  Taking into account all the facts that there are only 150,000 copies out there, the price seems rather reasonable for such a ""rare"" item.  Even with that, it's still rather high.All in all, definitely worth the value you put into it.  One quick side note here before I finish.  The film IS presented in original format, which is FULLSCREEN.  Films prior to 1953 were not shown in theaters in what we now know as WIDESCREEN.  This was developed in the early fifties during the television boom to help add to the experience movie-goers wanted.  EVEN WITH THAT IN MIND, the set is great and I highly recommend it.(CAPS WORDS are used for emphasis, not yelling.)",N/A

Animation isn't top-notch, but it's still visually interesting. The characters were all lovable (except, of course, the vilains); I didn't even mind Anne-Marie the little girl at all. The violence and adult situations are not clearly obvious, but little kids will probably be horrified at some of the images put on screen. As one reviewer mentioned before, this isn't really for young children, so every parent is warned. The one problem I had with ADGTH was the songs.

1213317,"This 18th century costume drama actually stays fairly close to the historical record -- with some changes and adaptations. It tells the story of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who falls into a loveless marriage with an older aristocrat who only wants her to produce a male heir. They get into a weird menage with her best friend who becomes the Duke's mistress. Meanwhile, Georgiana is pining for the embraces of Mr. Grey, an aspiring Whig politician.With gorgeous gowns and wonderful hairdos as well as terrific locations in great English homes like Chatsworth, this movie makes for pleasant viewing without ever engaging the emotions. I did some research which showed it stayed fairly close to the historical record. It did suggest that Georgiana and Charles Grey met and fell in love when she was 17. But he was six years younger than her so that could not have been the case. (This was the Earl Grey after whom the tea is named. As prime minister, he passed the 1832 Reform Act, cutting out some of the worst abuses of the electoral system and setting Britain on its long path to democracy).The movie does cover Georgiana's significant political role. She is also said to have inspired Sheridan's ""School for Scandal."" She was an interesting and significant historical figure.The movie alludes to but glosses over Georgiana's gambling addiction. She died 20,000 pounds in debt which in today's money is a staggering amount of almost Madoff-like proportions.However these are minor cavils. One does not expect a movie to be a historical documentary. My main problem with this film is that I did not for a moment believe I was watching real 18th century characters. I felt more that I was seeing 21st century characters dressed up in 18th century costumes. They did not think or feel like people of their own time, which was considerably different from our own, but appealed to our 21st sensibilities.That particularly applies to the winsome (not to say anorexic) Kiera Knightly who moves languidly through the movie like a fashion model. The problem I find with this actress is that I rarely feel any real appetite for life in her -- for the good or the bad. Everything happens at a remove. Her way of portraying tragedy relies more on makeup than acting and she has an annoying way of sucking in her cheeks to indicate emotion.That said, I still give this movie three stars. It's eminently watchable.",The Duchess

The awkwardness of getting caught in a few lies, meeting people who are twisted and a heartbeat away from becoming family, and much bizarre acting out make for some moments of squirm and dark comedy. Don't expect family friendly fare either. There are some awkward sexual comments.There's not a lot of Christmas feel-good spirit in this one.

This is the best work she has ever done and puts her beyond her ancestors as the greatest Barrymore in the dynasty.And buried in the midst of these two towering performances one must not neglect the brilliant, lovely and gentle work by Jeanne Tripplehorn as Jackie Kennedy. Her work here is wonderful. Miss Tripplehorn is indeed with her work on HBO's ""Big Love"" and here in this film fulfilling her youthful promise as an actress and coming into her own in her middle years.The thing of the matter is that these two wonderful actresses meld into the women in the story so convincingly that if you have seen the original documentary you will think you are seeing the real Beals.  A great film, a touching and deeply moving story, a film that should be admired and treasured for the masterpiece it is.",Grey Gardens

At least the Halloween sequels prior to  Mr. Cummings directorial disasters had a fun factor to them.  Not this skid mark of film.

226240,"From the moment I heard Dolly Parton's uniquely engaging voice come over my television stereo set singing the theme song to this 80's comedy I knew that I was going to enjoy myself.  I don't know what it is about that woman that I just adore, but whatever, that's neither here nor there.  The fact is that before I even got into the meat of this movie I had made my mind up.  By the time the credits began to roll I have changed my mind completely.  Yet still, by the time I woke up the next morning I had a very different outlook.Okay, so here's the thing; `9 to 5' is a deceitful little thing.This is what I mean.  `9 to 5' is not a laugh out loud type of comedy.  Maybe it is to some, but for me it was one of those `laugh quietly on the inside' type of comedies, and so because of that when the film ends I wound up thinking it wasn't really all that funny.  But it's also one of those comedies that sits well with you.  As you think about it you wind up finding the humor and before long you remember it funnier than when you were watching it.Make sense?So the film revolves around three working women and their egotistical boss.  Violet Newstead is a hard working woman seeking out a promotion that she wholeheartedly deserves; Doralee Rhodes is a hard working secretary just trying to do her job right despite the nasty rumors floating around the office, and Judy Bernly is a recent divorcee who just wants to prove her independence.  The problem they all share is the man they call boss; Franklin M. Hart Jr.When an accident gives sends one of the girls into a panic their lives are forever changed as they find themselves holding their boss hostage, getting involved in blackmail and eventually teaching the man a thing or two about girl-power.As far as the acting is concerned, there are clear standouts and a few disappointing letdowns.  First of all, Dolly Parton is a doll and a comedic knockout; truly the most inspired performance between the three leads.  Jane Fonda, an actress I am not usually smitten with, is less inspired but she manages to be better than I would have given her credit for.  My biggest disappointment came in the form of Lily Tomlin, who I just expected to be amazing.  I usually find her a comedic delight and a true standout in just about everything, but here she was at times rather dull.The truth of the matter is though, that as much as this film is about these three women and their `standing up to the man', it is the man himself that runs away with the entire show.  Yes, Dabney Coleman, AKA Franklin M. Hart Jr. is seriously the funniest and most engaging part of this film.  He nails his character and delivers one of my favorite supporting performances of the said year.So, the film is not as good as I expected (it can feel a little bland at times) but if you let it rest a bit it winds up being funnier the more you think about it.  In parts it's great and so maybe that's why it's funnier to think about than to watch, since when you think about it you think about the better parts.  Anyways, it's worthy watching at least once; if only for the great Coleman and the vivacious Parton.",9 to 5 VHS

1181616,"The Zombie Diaries is basically Blair Witch but with zombies instead of... well, nothing. That sentence alone will probably already tell you if you'll like it or not.It's not a bad film; it's the story of three groups, all with video cameras, recording their experiences during a zombie outbreak in Great Britain. The three seperate stories all co-mingle at the end. The problem is it has 3 HUGE flaws:1: There really isn't any reason for these people to be recording all this. They are literally recording themselves about 80% or more of the time with very little explanation as to why or, indeed, how since they don't seem to have extra film, electricity or batteries. There's really only three times in the film I could see people actually filming the events happening. It gets ridiculous when they record themselves having day to day conversations or when they are supposed to be sneaking through dangerous buildings.2: The zombies are a sideline at best. They rarely show up and they are very much the ""lurking threat"". This isn't really a problem, any good zombie film is about the people, not the undead (with the exception of the excellent Return of the Living Dead) but the camerawork makes the living dead seem strangely mythical in nature; as if they were never really there. Plus, zombie makeup apparently stops at the neck, there's more then a few zombies with very decayed facial features only to have silky smooth Ivory soap hands.3: The director. What? How is the director the one of the biggest flaws? Well, he and another member of the production crew apparently have been making multiple false user names and spamming message boards with how great the film is. Normally, big deal, but when you create converstaions between multiple fake indidviduals and viciously attack anyone who doesn't like the movie, you're doing WAY more harm then good.

There are a few things here that just kill this movie.1.  The movie portrays the Secret Service as a bunch of poorly trained buffoons.  I know for a fact that this is nonsense.  These guys are highly trained specialists.  A lot of them are ex-military.  There is no way that one guy could take out over a dozen of them like portrayed in the film.  No way.2.  The worlds dumbest kid stops dead in front of a speeding ambulance and the terrorist driver swerves out of the way to avoid killing her.  Since when do terrorists worry about killing kids?3.  One of the terrorists has a cell phone with technology from the 31st century.  He can detonate bombs, activate machine guns, and shave in the morning with this thing.  The only thing missing from it was a transporter from Star Trek.4.  If kidnapping the President of the United States was that easy, G.W. Bush would have been taken out 6 years ago.

The setup isn't bad and the film manages to look really good, using the backdrop of the mountains, snow, and interesting camera angles.  Unfortunately, the film is pretty short on plot.

1104779,"Awarded Best Film honors at the 2007 Anime Awards in Tokyo, Japan, ""Paprika "" tells of a group of well-meaning scientists who invent a machine capable of controlling people's dreams - only to discover that the dreams, in a retaliatory measure, have actually begun controlling them.This cautionary tale about the abuse of science and technology may be confusing at times - not surprising given its near-constant merging of dreams and dreamlike states with ""reality"" - but the concept is an intriguing one, a tribute to the fertile imaginations that concocted it:  writer Seishi Minakami and co-writer/director Satoshi Kan (working off the novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui), along with a handful of first-rate animation artists who have brought it all to miraculous life on film.  The execution is smart and visually compelling, filled with eerie scenes of abandoned amusement parks and bizarrely incongruous images (refrigerators dancing, toads playing musical instruments etc.) that effectively capture the bewildering and often discomfiting nature of dreams and nightmares.In addition, the characters are well-rounded and complex, the storyline endlessly inventive and challenging, and the moral and ethical issues dealt with in a manner that is both thought-provoking and evenhanded.Indeed, ""Paprika"" is so imaginative and visually stimulating that even non-anime fans may find themselves irresistibly drawn into the amazingly kaleidoscopic world it unfolds before them.",N/A

I use Leslie's videos as sort of a topper to a much harder workout or when I dont want to lift weights and I would say this is good at working up a sweat and burning calories.I have a few of her videos and like this one the best because:-She has just the right amount of people on set.  Unlike some of her others  where people feel bunched up.-I like the fact their are 5 miles which seem to average about 12-13 minute miles, unlike some of her others that can be 15-16, so it is much faster.-She is not as chatty as in some of her other videos and her focus seems to be really on the excercise.When she starts her miles off, she uses brisk music and then at about 1/2 a mile the music gets faster which I usuually up the excercise into boosted walking until the end of the mile (just a suggestion to burn more calories).  I also use arm weights to burn a little extra calories.  The first and last mile are Leslie by herself, the 2nd mile seems to be the most energetic of all 5 miles (much younger crowd involved)and the 3rd and 4th mile are good just seems geered to more of a introduction to people on set and less energetic.This was my first Leslie Sansone video and since bought 5 others which really do not compare to this one.  This was well put together, cueing was good, focus is their with this one.  I just wish her videos could stick with this format and wish Leslie would come out with maybe a 7 mile ""ADVANCED"" walk.

It all felt completely contrived. There was no depth to anything in the movie either, except for the final speech which was the only 2 minutes of the movie worth watching.Really the whole message of that speech is that Americans (yes Kevin represents most of us) are lazy, ignorant, selfish people who deserve the politicians that we put in office with our ignorance and falling for their manipulative advertisements.

1216920,"""Alien Raiders"" is a low-budget sci-fi/horror film that would have been right at home at a 1950's Saturday matinee.  The movie has a great opening.  At just after 11 P.M. on a typical evening at an Arizona supermarket, a group of masked, heavily armed intruders kill several employees and shoppers and hold the remainder hostage.  What we assume soon turns out to be just the opposite, however, as we learn that an alien infestation has been discovered and tracked to this store on this night.The film has no name stars, but that's par for the course with many genre films.  What matters more are the special effects and the originality of the script.  ""Alien Raiders"" is far better than most.  Working with a limited budget, director Ben Rock wisely keeps glimpses of the creatures brief and deeply shadowed.  He builds tension and provides some actual characterization along the way.  At a mere 85 minutes, the R-rated film moves quickly and seldom bogs down.  Viewers may notice similarities to Stephen King's ""The Mist,"" but ""Alien Raiders"" veers off into fresh territory.  Bonus extras include a making-of featurette and a behind-the-scenes look at the picture's special effects.",Alien Raiders

The people who would probably enjoy this the most are probably actors, it would be great to actually have the insight into if actors really as big a bunch of self-absorbed butt wads as the film portrays, ok, we know they are but the film sometimes plays a little like an in-joke.

896777,"I first saw this on RTE in Ireland in 1984. I looked for it thereafter,  ran into it once at a rep house in the late 1980s, and searched in vain for years until it finally surfaced on DVD at my local video retailer. It made more of an impression on me than any movie, except maybe Raging Bull and The Deer Hunter. Yes, that's pretty august company, but really, it's that powerful. The plot has been summarized fully in other reviews so there's no need to repeat it. It does bear repeating that the cast is wonderful, the cinematography haunting and ideally suited to the twisted material, and the pacing impeccable. It's not typical noir, however, in that there is no murder, no mystery to be solved, and no world-weary hero (though there is an impressive femme fatale). Instead, the horror and power come from the viewer's realization that the protagonist is not a ""movie monster"" a la Dracula, but a not-so-far-from-ordinary man whose life has taken stranger turns, and who has traveled farther into his own ambition and greed than most of us are ever compelled to go. Is anyone never tempted to overreach? Couldn't anyone fall to Stan's depths if hungry enough, addicted enough, desperate enough? ""There but for the grace of God,"" as they say. Forgive the wimpy redemptive ending; the filmmakers had no choice under the Production Code of the day. It's a miracle the film was made at all given the source material.

1233615,"1. I think the idea of telling the story from the point of view of the Manipulated Dead instead of the Living Reciever was great. 2. I think the idea of continuing the story using Samantha Darko was great. 3. I believe Iraq Jack was a brilliant character.These great ideas, unfortunately were poorly executed. Here's why I think this way:1. As I have watched Donnie Darko, I have certainly wondered what it was like for Frank the Bunny. He was the second most important character in Donnie Darko but we know virtally nothing about him. So I could certainly understand why someone would want to write a movie from this perspective. I think the reason it was so poorly done in the movie is because the idea that Samantha Darko would be the Manipulated Dead is just downright stupid and illogical. The Manipulated Dead should have been a completely different character.2. Continuing the tale from Samantha Darko's perspective is brillant. Why? Because she would have found the book The Philosophy of Time Travel. She would have been motivated to find out why her brother had this book and what the book meant. She could have tracked down someone who knew Roberta Sparrow, leading her to Iraq Jack. Then Fisher (the director)could have explored Roberta's back story like he said he considered doing in the special features on the DVD. Perhaps Corey could have still been a part of it. A friend occupying her on her journey trying to run from her past, while Samantha was trying to find information so she could understand hers.3. And while these two young women are trying to deal with their past, Samantha meets Iraq Jack (and some of the towns characters. A few of them were nothing but filler in this movie.). The character of Iraq Jack was the one character that the creators got right in this movie. Unfortunately, they do very little to let us get to know him. In Donnie Darko, Donnie's identity and angst was explored in great detail. The creators of this movie should have done the same with Iraq Jack, exploring the depths of his post traumatic stress disorder and need to do something to right all his wrongs. If Samantha had watched his life unfold in a similar way that Donnie's had, she could have understood what Donnie went through, realized her brother was a hero, and made peace with his death. Samantha would have had a huge character change by the end and been a lot less passive.Ultimately, I think the director Chris Fisher made a fairly good fan fiction movie, but nothing more. I give the movie 3 stars because there were some brillant ideas in there. Samantha's role as the Manipulated Dead does perhaps help us understand the incredible character of Frank the Bunny a bit more. I think the subplot of the asteroid affecting the person studying it was vulgar and ruined the beauty and mystery of the Donnie Darko universe. It just didn't fit in with the rest of the story. The asteroid shower was hardly end of the world like. The scene where Iraq Jack goes back to the windmill to change his fate was great but everything else just fizzles at the end.In the special features, nearly everyone's gut reation to the idea of making a continuation of Dannie Darko was DON'T! The fact that The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko was somewhat poorly recieved should have made Fisher realize his continuation would not be well received. It's almost as if he thought, ""Die hard fans will hate this movie, but they will still want to see it."" There just seems to be something very wrong with that. Egotistical even.",N/A

Genghis Khan is portrayed as a complex man - honorable but with a temper. Like the story of the Mongol empire, the movie isn't just about big battles, but how Genghis Khan was able to unite his conquered enemies into a greater force rather than plundering their lands.This is a Japanese film, and the movie has a Japanese feel to it. The language spoke is not Japanese. Some of the cultural traits (excessive asking for forgiveness, bonzai-style chants, etc.) really seem more Japanese than Mongol. It would have been more appropriate to give the film more a Mongol flavor. Despite this, it overall feels like an epic period drama.I'd recommendGenghis Khan and the Making of the Modern Worldif you want a good book about Genghis Khan.",N/A
153880,"ROBOCOP is one of those rare movies that is a fusion of elements of many different films that work to great effect in one film. A mixture of science fiction, action, drama, police procedural (and maybe even a bit of horror), ROBOCOP is a brilliant satire that is still relevant as both a film and social commentary even today. Telling the story of Officer Alex J. Murphy (excellently played by Peter Weller), who is mercilessly gunned down by a band of criminals led by Clarence Boddicker (effortlessly played by Kurtwood Smith), Murphy's body is transformed into Robocop as part of Detroit-based corporation OCP's contract with the city to help fight crime (and earn OCP a hefty profit in the process). The Robocop program is run by Bob Morton (slick performance by Miguel Ferrer), an ambitious VP within the company's ranks. Morton was given the go-ahead when the ED-209 program fell through. ED-209 was the project of senior VP Dick Jones (played with cold-hearted brio by Ronny Cox). Weller (as the film's hero) and Cox, Ferrer,Smith (as it's villains) truly drive this film with their convincing performances and help make this film a classic. Nancy Allen (as Murphy's partner Anne Lewis) also does fine work and adds to the films' value.This is director Paul Verhoeven's best film and it's not really even close! Somehow, by virture of who knows what, Verhoeven has managed to make an eternally watchable, involving, and provocative sci-fi action classic out of the most simple of stories and even with it's fast pace, ROBOCOP has these moments of genuine humanity where the viewer both sympathizes with Murphy's fate and is awed by the sheer power of Robocop. The action scenes are crisp and fluid, the dialogue is sharp and cutting, and the story just plain draws the viewer in.Made in the 80s (came out in 1987), of course it has a somewhat dated look at times, but I even think this can be overlooked as it is set in an undisclosed not-too-distant future, kind of a skewed vision of a decaying economy with dilapidated city settings and criminal activity at an all time high. Director Paul Verhoeven does a great job of focusing primarily on action and character and not so much on technological aspects. Even in those scenes, the viewer finds oneself so invested in the characters and plot that you ignore rather minor details.

I have to comment on some of the criticisms I have seen here--if you are looking for belly laughs and lousy computer generated effects,take your short attention span back to your x-box. This movie is a beautiful exercise in real story telling. These two seasoned actors bring incredible meaning and depth to a movie about real things that happen to people in real life. I was touched by the obvious and not so obvious messages in this story and feel it was, for me, a much awaited change from the fast-paced, meaningless bumblers Hollywood keeps ralphing out.

There has never been nor will ever be anything else like it.  Even if you don't like it, you will never  forget it.  Jodorowski's cinematic vision places him in the same class as Luis Bunuel, Frederico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick, and Igmar Bergman.So what's this movie about?  It's one man's spiritual quest, which leads to a place that no one could foresee.  This movie will keep your eyes glued to the screen.  It's worth going out of your way to see it.",The Holy Mountain

He's a very good actor and it's surprising that this film isn't better known. Moreover, the movie raises issues that are still relevant: mysterious forces behind presidential assassinations, what can ordinary citizens do in the face of evil? what should mothers do when their kids want to play with guns? It's also a reminder of a day when most American men had served in the military or were familiar with guns.

I love family films, especially if they are in an older setting that move you and stay with you for a while to come.MY DOG SKIP is one of such films.  This was not a kids flick, indeed this is a young adult/adult movie narrated by the author of the same book - based on the true story of his dog Skip, now a national bestseller novel.Willie Morris' parents give him a Jack Russell puppy for this ninth birthday.  He proceeds to bond with is dog, who's precocious and loving manner teaches Willie how to deal with the pressures of being a kid and coming of age in Mississippi in the 1940's.This film moved me with its depth of emotional intensity and beauty, unlike any I have seen in a long time.  It was beautifully acted, the moments depicting the situations remembered by Willie regarding his escapades with his dog and friends - who loved Skip equally, are one of a kind.

1176031,"(1.) Martial arts scenes, techniques and schools were poorly represented & performed. Too much  reliance on obvious blood filled capsules for the mouth and bullets. The breaking prosthetic limbs and poorly created decapitated heads had a laughable effect. The wholly inadequate filming angles and editing made Carradine's lack of skills look even slower and older. Not in the same ballpark/planet as anything Lee, Chan, Li, or Crouching Tiger..., Hero, House of Flying Daggers.(2.) The low budget of this film was most obvious when initially we are shown a small number of bad guys but when the battles begin it seems as if that number has tripled or even become endless as they are mown down in order to prolong the attention-getting action scenes. Yet when the final scene shows the field of battle the body count adds up to less than what we were first shown. May I suggest some remedial math for the director.(3.) Daryl Hannah - no point to her role in the movie, in fact you could have erased her scenes and the movie would have moved forward with better fluidity. Her acting was so terrible I was actually feeling sorry for her. Carradine's was not much better.(4.) Overall the story line was old and tired and disjointed, e.g. some wealthy Singaporean wants to conquer all of China with a poisonous gas he creates in his basement and meanwhile the superpowers of Europe with all their labs and resources were having problems producing the same warfare gas.",Kung Fu Killer

Still, the consolation is that in Blood Wedding we finally get to see Cully marry her Simon. And as a special treat, there is a guest appearance from Gavin Troy (Barnaby's original sidekick)!

The series is set in the fictional Misomer County, which comprises of many cosy, rural villages, where wealthy and poor alike seem to do each other in at an average rate of three to four bodies per episode.

He sets out to entertain and does so from start to finish, never allowing himself to take things too seriously, and never patronising his audience.To be honest, there's nothing new here, but it's done with such esprit and flair that its derivative nature is forgivable: This is homage rather than lack of imagination. If, however, Whedon had managed to come up with a more original story this would have been a 5-star movie.BTW, look out for references to other blockbusters including Blade Runner, the Indiana Jones and Star Wars series, along with many others.

He knows his facts and marshals them against Republicans, organized religions, drug companies, and Bush 43. (It anticipates his recent movie release ""Religulous."") It's a series of hard-hitting, obscene, and rapid fire jokes.President Clinton comes off fairly well, although I've always thought he would make a perfect target for an all-out assault. If you're a right wing zealot, you'd better avoid this full frontal attack. Maher extols the virtues of condoms. If you're going to attack the right wingers, you might as well hit all the bases.Surprisingly there is not too much about Vice-president Cheney except his poor aim when hunting. If you're a Bush-basher, a true Democrat, a libertarian, or an agnostic, you'll probably love this. I found it profanely and profoundly hilarious.

1147509,"NATIONAL LAMPOON'SCATTLE CALLThe National Lampoon banner has brought us some really great films over the years from Animal House to the Van Wilder films and everything in between I have enjoyed most of them. Over the years they have went from a movie power house with every film being a theatrical classic to more so of a straight to DVD Company with the occasional theatrical run. While this one is a straight to DVD release I do feel like it is one of the better ones from the company lately. I thought it was funny and very entertaining plus the three guys on here make a great team, as does the three women.Fellas have you ever been so desperate to meet a woman that you would do anything to find one, the right one. Well if you have ever felt that way then this may be the movie for you, or maybe not depending on if you try to do this. These guys come up with an idea to hold a fake movie casting call in order to audition the perfect girlfriend. It seems that has been tried before in a very famous film called ""Audition"", didn't work out so well for that guy. But regardless of that they all agree that this is the best way for them to meet the women of their dreams. So the scam is on and it is working out very well until the girls learn of their plan, so they play the game right back.The film is a very interesting one and has some very funny moments but the cast is what makes this film work. Thomas Ian Nicholas is very good in the lead role and plays his part perfectly and comes across greatly as a jerk. Diedrich Bader steals the show in my opinion with his off the wall character and how he plays it. Andrew Katos is good as well and like the other two plays one of the three loser jerks very well. From the ladies Jenny Mollen is great in this one playing sweet and then vindictive much like the other two. Nicole Eggert plays it just as well as does Chelsea Handler because all three women are just as good if not better in this film.Writer/director Martin Guigui did a great job with this film taking an idea that has somewhat been done and made it feel original. The writing for this film was really good and funny and the direction seemed well executed as well. Now this is not a classic or anything but for a straight to DVD NL film it is good. The way the girls flip it on the guys is great all though it is a little far fetched how everything ends but hey it's a movie. Things end up crazy some times but the last scene in this film is priceless, I loved it.Over all this is a good and enjoyable film that I think most would enjoy, at least those with a bored weekend looking for something to watch. Is this the best movie ever, no but it is an entertaining one. National Lampoon did a good job with this one as it is better than most things they have been putting out the last couple of years independently. Still even then this is not the best of those, but I recommend a rental.",National Lampoon Presents Cattle Call

The action follows a group of Christians who are dedicated to preserving Christ's Holy Cup twenty years after the Last Supper...Since Newman had the lead as a young Greek silversmith, sold into slavery, then chosen by the Christians to design a chalice for the Cup, becomes involved in battles and orgies, and must decide between the pagan world represented by a courtesan (Virginia Mayo) and the Christian world represented by his young, innocent wife (Pier Angeli). There is also a mad pagan magician (Jack Palance), who wants to destroy the chalice and establish his own religion, replacing Christ's miracles with black magic...Newman was ideally cast as a Greek, because of his classic features, but he makes his film debut at particularly unfortunate time... 1954 was the year of ""The Wild One"" and ""On the Waterfront,"" and Brando was at the height of his popularity...",The Silver Chalice VHS

But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. ""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" kept me interested from beginning to end, and it is truly what a great suspense film should be all about.C.J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe) is a young, ambitious reporter, who has been investigating Mark Hunter (Michael Douglas), a powerful District Attorney who is running for Governor. He believes that Hunter wins all his conviction trials by fabricating evidence. However, C.J.'s boss informs him that the budget for investigative reporters has been cut due to low ratings, and that he has been dumped to do general assignments. Not happy with his editor's decision, he takes upon himself to proceed with Hunter's investigation, convinced that this case will make him famous and win him a Pulitzer Prize. For this purpose, he recruits Corey Finley (Joel Moore) -- his friend and colleague -- to help him in his research. He also romances Ella Crystal (Amber Tamlyn), a young attorney that works with Hunter, and unknowingly enlists her to assist him to get her boss. Unbeknown to C.J., he is in for the ride of his life.

1282239,"When I saw advertisements for this film, including a poster that had two silhouetted people, the female with a heart on her head and a male with the heart on his crotch, I full expected a gentle romance with moving dialogue and a story that would haunt my dreams for years to come... Yeah right! The film never hides what it is! Like the TV show in the film that is rescued by the addition of a lewd commentator, this film is selling sex. Like most people I recognized that immediately, but I do understand that many people will be surprised (like I was) at the very high level of lewdness and vulgarity.There are a lot of so-called romantic comedies that include sex as a focal point (mirroring life). But most of these movies are marketed to women and so moviegoers can safely assume that the sexuality won't be amazingly vulgar and the language will most likely be crass but not over the top lewd. This movie has much more in common with some of the toilet humor male comedies in recent history than the standard romantic comedy.The Ugly Truth is a waste of time with a few hilarious moments but overloaded with foul language, sexual conversations and situations and some partial nudity. It wasn't good. It wasn't memorable.As for me, it was below average and I won't watch it again or recommend friends to watch it either.",N/A

I've become more open to more esoteric styles of practice, and find that the rhythmic movements and more ecstatic breathwork feel energizing to me now, and years ago they would've made me feel awkward.My gym is closed this week because it got robbed, and it got me to finally crack open the package and do this wonderful routine!!  This video is half yoga practice, half informal dance, and it felt wonderful to do both physical practices back-to-back.  I have always been put off by Kundalini, and I do have to be careful of my joints and strain--if I was a beginner, these videos would not be good for me but I know how to take care of myself in poses and movement after 18 years of doing yoga!I try to let go of any thoughts around Ana's tiny outfits and longing to be so thin and toned--I'm a woman and live in our western culture, and it does come up, to be honest.

The dance is delightful, I've gotten bored with more formal home dance practice and somewhat intimidating ""beginner"" New York classes, and also can't do certain dance tapes at home due to my downstairs neighbor's objection to noise, and this was not too much pounding but lots of energetic and flowing movement.All this--for less than the price of a yoga class, I might add.",N/A

And who can forget the T-Rex in the first frightening scene and the Raptors in the last intense scene? This is truly memorable stuff.

1233321,"I grew up on Hong Kong martial arts films, recently visited the Forbidden City Palace and Great Wall in Beijing, and heard this was the first Bollywood kung fu comedy, so I went to watch this movie on its opening night.  I absolutely loved it.I'm not familiar with Bollywood, but I thought the movie might be goofy-silly from the trailer.  It was so much more than that.The plot is well summarized by another reviewer, so I won't go into it in detail.  Basically, a comedic buffoon in India is tricked into going to China to help an oppressed village.  Along the way, he finds love, kung fu, and himself.  The plot was complex but fun.  The movie is in Hindi (spoken by the characters from India) and Mandarin (spoken by the characters from China) with good English subtitles.In some points where the plot stretched credibility, I figured it was a Bollywood thing, and just went with the flow.  For example, the heroine's family situation, airport incident, the drunken master fight, the kung fu training sequences, were all a bit unrealistic, but great fun.The costumes and dancing were great (who knew a womem could dance in the long chinese cheongsam dresses?).  I especially liked the scenes set in the Forbidden City Palace and the Great Wall.  I read that this was the first fight scene permitted to be filmed on the Great Wall, and having been on the beautiful, windy, and super-steep steps of the Great Wall, I loved each and every Great Wall scene.  I read that they shut down tourism for the filming, which is impressive given how packed the tourist site normally is.I expected a lot of eye candy going in, based on the trailer, but I was caught completely by surprise by just how funny and dramatic the movie was.  My friend and I laughed so hard that we cried through many points of the movie (laughing so hard our eyes were shut and I missed some of the English subtitles).  There were some very touching points in the movie, aptly scored by a beautiful musical score.The hero was an amazing actor.  Initially, he is a completely pathetic and cringe-worthy coward.  There was a lot of slapstick and very funny physical humour.  By the end of the movie the hero was James-Bond handsome and riveting.  I often see female characters have this physical transformation in movies (mouse to model) but have never seen this in a male character.  The hero was completely believable and his transformation was very touching.Some of the martial arts scenes might seem over the top, but the Hong Kong film martial arts are just like that, with exploding boxes, water rising, internal strength forces battling it out through palm stances, windstorms, etc.  It was just like a really good martial arts film with Bollywood dancing and plot touches.The movie was longer than I was used to, but I figured that was a Bollywood thing and enjoyed every minute of it.  Be warned, though, there is quite a bit of casual physical discipine between adult children and their parental figures, which was a bit of a surprise to me.There were some corny points, which I initially thought was bad directing, but the rest of the theatre laughed extremely hard right away, so I guess it was a sly spoof device used in Bollywood movies.  For example, one of the funniest scenes for me is when the Indian/Chinese friend of the hero sees the assassin for the first time and after a stunned silence, bursts into song.  The entire audience was howling with laughter and clapping, as the comedic timing in that scene was just perfect.I highly recommend this film to everyone.  More than 24 hours later, I'm still thinking of the film and smiling in memory of some of the scenes.  I'm definitely going to get this on blu-ray when it comes out.",Chandni Chowk to China

The Man With the Screaming Brain stars Campbell (who also co-wrote the story) as an American industrialist in Bulgaria with his wife.  Their marriage is failing rapidly, and it isn't too long before Campbell, his wife, and an ex-KGB cab driver all fall victim to a pretty, murderous gypsy woman who dreams of getting married.  Before you know it, a mad scientist (Stacy Keach) re-animates Campbell's body; with pieces of the cab driver's brain inside his head to match.  From this point on, it's easy to tell that Man With the Screaming Brain is meant to be as ridiculous as can be, with Campbell giving one of his most manic and wonderfully comic performances to date.  Keach is hilarious as well as the mad professor, and Ted Raimi (brother of Sam) is great too as his Igor-like assistant.  As you can tell by now, this isn't a movie for everybody, but for those loyal (and some obsessed) followers of Bruce Campbell, this is a must see.",N/A

There lives are short, not because of disease, but because the apes are hunting them to extinction.The burgeoning simian society is made up of three classes.  There are the gorillas; their main activity is to hunt humans.  Those not killed are used for research and target practice.  Their General sent scouts into the Forbidden Zone; only one came back.Then there are the chimpanzees; they are the intellectuals, scientists, and veterinarians.  Although the gorilla's believe there is nothing to be learned by studying humans, they do allow the chimpanzees to examine and experiment on them.And lastly, there are the baboons; they are the administrators.  Most prominent, Doctor Zaius is the Minister of Science and The Chief Defender of the Faith.

I loved the castle and the characters within. It comes to a point one forgets we're not dealing with real people and really become involved in the action and storyline. There appeared to be a few gaps here and there, particularly when it came to the Kings Sorceress, still a totally engaging story.Highly recommended.",N/A

Whether you end up becoming a believer in Jesus Christ is up to whether your heart can accept the spiritual and divine. Not all people are open to that. But Fireproof is undeniably a powerful film. The critics can pan things because they are ignorant of the biblical nuances - before Caleb deals with addiction, he places his wife's picture on his desk. Why? Because when you want to eradicate an addiction, you must replace it ... with something good to fill the void. There are many other parts of this movie that are worth a second look because it provides right biblical teaching. I liked Fireproof because it shows me the impact a film can have without all the waste of $ of a big blockbuster. But then I feel salaries need to come down in Hollywood - that's why there's so much pirating. They want unreasonable profits. Much the same reason we are in this economic mess now: Greed.

1250090,"If the acting in ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" had been better, it might have been a decent movie. Not great, but decent. As things stand, however, the combination of a dull, predictable plot and substandard acting make Charlie Banks a big ol' waste of time.The plot, such as it is, centers around Charlie Banks, played by Jesse Elsenberg who here plays the only kind of role that he ever plays, a nervous, nerdy nice kid perpetually afraid of getting swatted down like an insect. Charlie is enjoying the college life, having philosophical discussions with his friends while drinking beers, chasing women (unsuccessfully), when he and his roommate receive a visit from Mick (Jason Ritter), a charming sociopath that they know from earlier in the film.The meat of the film is supposed to revolve around Charlie's quasi-friendship with Mick, who is equal parts bully, mentor, and friend to Charlie. I won't ruin the ending but I will tell you that nothing happens that you don't expect. The writer attempts to prepare the audience for this lack of surprise by having the characters discuss The Great Gatsby and how, even the first time you read it, you already know how it's going to end, but that doesn't make it any less brilliant. In fact, they tell us, it makes it even better. It makes the ending seem all the more tragic because it's so inevitable.Well, Charlie Banks isn't The Great Gatsby and the formulaic ending (Charlie faces his fears, etc.) nicely caps off a film that is rich with stereotypes and cliches.The biggest problem with Charlie Banks, however, is the performance of Jason Ritter as the bully-friend-mentor, Mick. We are told repeatedly throughout the movie how charismatic Mick is, even though (or, perhaps, precisely because) he's such a violent guy. Jason Ritter doesn't come across as either dangerous or charismatic. Most of the time, he just looks goofy. He does hit people a few times, it's true, but that action does not spring naturally from his character; he simply does it because it's written in the script.The other lame performance in this movie is the love interest, Eva Amurri. Both Charlie and Mick are completely in love with this woman; I have no idea why. She's not particularly beautiful, she certainly never says or does anything even remotely interesting, and by the end of the film we still have no idea who she is or why she made the choices that she did.""The Education of Charlie Banks"" is a movie that will pound you over the head with its foreshadowing, symbolism, and attempts at ""deepness"" but ultimately it's just a big ol' bore.",Education Of Charlie Banks

So, I decided to watch it again recently and like the reviewer, Bindy Sue, I had to watch it twice to figure it out. Fans of the original Twilight Zone should really like this movie as it borrows quite heavily from the mind of Rod Serling, throws in pure horror, and the creepiness factor of driving along a lonely road in the middle of nowhere late at night. I cited the movie Burnt Offerings because the ""death car"" that slowly drives up the street in several scenes in this movie reminded me of the black hearse in the Burnt Offerings movie - you know when it shows up, bad things are about to happen.

1325771,"Bam! It's appropriate that Emeril Lagasse plays a (bit) character in The Princess and the Frog, voicing Marlon the `gator. This film proves that Disney's once-vaunted hand-drawn animation is back with a vengeance.The film has gorgeous visuals, engaging characters, a palpably evil villain and gags galore. Randy Newman's New Orleans-influenced score perfectly complements the story. It is laugh-out-loud funny. The romance between leads Tiana and Prince Naveen is touching and believable. The film's strong, down-to-earth message: You can't just wish upon a star for your dreams to come true. You'll have to work. Hard.Folks looking for a quality, old-school Disney film will not be disappointed. Like all the best Disney classics, The Princess and the Frog adapts a classic fairy tale and adds twists and wit. This story of hardworking Tiana, aspiring New Orleans restauranteur, and her froggy adventures will engage children and charm their parents. It's a movie that both kids and adults will enjoy.The supporting characters nearly steal the show. Tiana's friend Charlotte is a hoot: ""I'm sweating like a sinner in church!"" as she sops up the armpits of her Cinderella-esque ballgown. A trumpet-playing alligator, a jowly old lady steeped in hoo-doo, and, especially, a cajun firefly named Ray are originals. Ray's fantasy girlfriend: Evangeline, the evening star.The visuals have such power. One shot of dandelions covered with droplets of dew is as sumptuous as anything in Disney'sFantasiafrom 1940. Psychedelic scenes with villain Dr. Facilier rival the bizarre scenes in 1944'sThe Three Caballerosor 1941'sDumbo. A silent funeral in a swamp has a misty, magical beauty.As the first major Disney movie with African-American lead characters since 1946's The Song of the South, the film doesn't sidestep the race and class issue. At the beginning of the movie, young Tiana and her seamstress mother leave the opulent home of Big Daddy La Bouff to travel to their tiny tract home. Tiana's daddy has to work multiple jobs to support his family; as does the grown-up Tiana, trying to save up enough money to realize her dream of opening a restaurant. Later bankers tell Tiana that a girl of her ""background"" may be better off not having such a dream.Where have these gifted Disney animators been all these years? It seems they've picked up right where they left off, adding another thoroughbred to the stable of modern-day Disney classics such as 1989'sThe Little Mermaid, 1991'sBeauty and the Beastand 1994'sThe Lion King. Maybe it's producer John Lasseter's influence, with his insistence on excellence, especially with story and visuals. Whatever the reason, Walt Disney himself must be smiling in the heavens. Right next to Evangeline.-- Julie Neal, author ofThe Complete Walt Disney World 2010.",N/A
76928,"The only reason this has two stars is because the movie itself is so good. Otherwise, it's one star at best. First off, this is not a remastering. It looks no better than the DVD. In fact, the DVD may look better. You really see it in the credits type. In every other Blu-ray I have, they're crystal clear and sharp edged. Here, like in the DVD, they're very soft. The only other place I've seen type this soft is in the DVD of WKRP in Cincinnati, which was shot on videotape. In addition, the picture is frequently grainy and thin. Again, the DVD is the same way, but the Blu-Ray's higher definition makes the thin picture more obvious. The second problem is the extra features: Would you believe the Blu-ray doesn't have all the extras on the DVD? One of the documentaries from the DVD is missing.In short, if you have the DVD, don't bother with the Blu-ray. If you don't have either, get the DVD.

1195516,"Well, I thought I might, but as the credits rolled on the first official summer film of '09, I realized I really didn't.  The way the origin was set up or rather alluded to in the previous X-Men installments was far more interesting then this film's blow by blow of the specific events that created the Logan we all know and love.  Sure, I used to read X-Men comics as a middle schooler so I already knew how Wolverine became Wolverine, but I never realized how much  the mystery of Wolverine was more entertaining without the details until I saw this film.No plot synopsis...there's not much plot to this film anyway.The plot to this current Marvel film is very small and uninspired.  The majority of the film is made up of the relationships or rather the meloncholy melodrama Wolverine has with his half brother, his wife, and General Stryker.  The plot doesn't kick in until about the forty minute mark.  Honestly, once the plot wheels get greased and rolling the film becomes less and less involving.  Even the action sequences were ho-hum.  Which is surprising, because so much dark conflict is built into them they should have severe impact similar to that of The Dark Knight, but they just ring hollow and routine.  I really, for the life of me, can't pull a single memorable image from any of the pyrotechnics involved in this film's story.  Considering that where the majority of the budget goes on these films, that's not a good thing.The acting is all fine.  Liev Shrieber brings an adequetely menacing presence as Wolverine's half brother Victor.  How we're supposed to believe that this well-spoken and sadistic maniac turns into the lumbering oaf that was Sabertooth in X-Men part one maybe the next film's major mystery.  Ryan Reynolds shows up briefly to play the character of Wade.  It's so brief that when he(or rather a stuntman under heavy prosthetics) returns in the finale you have to take a few seconds to realise it's him, or at least listen very closely to some dubbed dialogue to further drive the point home.  Which is another problem.  The whole film sets up this major conflict between Logan and Victor and then drops it in favor of a mega showdown with Deadpool.  A character whose creation is rushed into the narrative at the last hour, and holds no emotional ties to Wolverine and ends up being a big, but hollow, special effects light show.  Bummer.  With all the pathos this film contains the ending really could've sealed the deal for this film.Marvel now oversees the productions of all its characters' film adaptions.  Sometimes this is a good thing(Iron-Man), sometimes not so much(The Incredible Hulk).  Did we really need to be introduced to Deadpool, Gambit and Cyclops in this film?  Nope!  Sure, the fanboys had joygasms in unisen when they showed up, but the rest of us who put their comics away years ago, got nothing out of it but a slight crinkle in the upper left side of the cheek.  The actor who plays Gambi, can't think of his name, does an admirable job of hinting at the type of character he may be or become in future installments.  Nothing outrageously speical, but that has more to do with the writing and less to do with the acting.  He's adequetly charming for the part.  We also get some scraps in the form of other Marvel characters, none of us average Joes give a crap about like The Blob, The Wraith and Silverfox and others....Hugh Jackman was born to play this role.  Yes, fanboys will go on and on about how he's too tall and not squat like a wolverine(lol), but he embodies the pathos and physicality and strength of character I remember from my comic years.  I want more Jackman Wolverine but I want a better written film to go with it.The bottom line is, the film is passable or better yet servicable fluff fair.  You won't remember much about it after its over and it's about equal to the first X-Men film, but not quite up to par with the second or third film, or other Marvel Universe films released.  It's a good companion piece with Ghost Rider and The Incredible Hulk, good enough but nothing special.PS: Is anyone else out there sad that the first major films of the summer are sequels(Terminator:Salvation), re-boots AKA remakes(Star Trek) and spin-offs(Wolverine)?  It's starting to depress me.  I've heard great things about the upcoming Terminator and Star Trek and hopefully I'll like them, but damn, could we get something original in the E.R. stat!?!?!?!?",X-Men Origins: Wolverine
1218498,"Donkey Punch is a taut little Brit-shocker that succeeds in many aspects, but fails in a couple of important ones. The main problem lies with the characters. The guys are callous and contemptible and the girls more than a little stupid. Although there are signs that the writers realised this, and therefore tried to make a couple of the characters more sympathetic, there's no one here that the viewer can really empathise with and as a result the brutality (and there's plenty of it) is diffused in its effect. And, while the viewer's allegiance is challenged from time to time, its hard to care too much about who survives and who doesn't. It's also a little slow in delivering the mayhem. Once it starts, however, the gears shift and it becomes an efficient, and gory, descent into chaos.",Donkey Punch Rated

395900,"The DVD that I watched is the Kino version.  I must say that I found the intensity of the blue highlights around the figures in the very first scene in the garden very exaggerated, but did not dislike it, rather I thought it was painterly way of representing the scene. I read in the reviews here that this is a distortion that does NOT appear in the Image version of the film, so I will make a point of getting that one for comparison purposes.The musical score feature offers two choices. Go for the traditional, the modern version does not work as well and eventually becomes very annoying.The film is an excellent example of how the artistic currents and tendencies of the time were affecting film and each media was influencing the other. The images in the movie most certainly reminded me of paintings that I have admired by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, particularly 4 paintings that show urban landscapes and figures, all done before the movie when the artist lived in Berlin: Nollendorfplatz, 1912 Berlin Street Scene, 1913  Potsdamer Platz, 1914  Brandenburger Tor, 1915  also the angularity of the architecture reminded me of the style of Franz Marc and August Macke's workks, both of them were great Expressionist painters that died very young and are even less well known than Kirchner. All of them portrayed the anxiety,dehumanization, and sheer horror that 'modern' life was providing for the regular urban dweller of those difficult  times in Germany, but that eventually became emblematic of the phenomenon worldwide. There is a famous coloured woodcut by another Expressionsit artist, Erich Heckel, Portrait of a Man, from 1919 that is the very face of Cesare, (played by Conrad Veit) the character that plays the murderous somnambulist in the film, it is tempting to think that the could have been the model. The makeup worn by Lil Dagover who plays Jane is very similar to the women portrayed by expressionistic artist Karl Schmidt-Rottluff.Also do note that the shadow projected on to the wall as Cesare approaches, then murders his first victim, is a device that we are going to see again, with similar horrific implications in ""Nosferatu"" just two years later.The device of using a story within a story, whereby at the very end we are led to believe that the whole thing has been an invention of Francis' deranged mind as we see that he, along with Jane and Cesare are patients of Caligari at a real-life assylum is straight from Kafka in sensibility.This is a must see movie for all interested in the German Expressionist movement, but also for horror/thriller fans, as this movieis the parent of the genre. Aside from the historical or artistic merits, it is still a very interesting, fascinating movie and not at all a museum relic. We get drawn into the weird, fantastical and claustrophobic world of Dr. Caligari and can not wait for the next scene to advance the plot. It benefits immensely from the absence of dialogue, as the intensity of the characters, and the effectiveness of the decor are more than well suited to convey all the significance we need. It truly is a perfect example of why silent movies are still important and relevant as independent works of art .One of the extra features is a 'condensed' 43 minute long version of  ""Genuine the tale of a Vampire"", which I also enjoyed watching. It has similar sets and backdrops to Caligari.The plot revolves around a femme fatale (played by Fern Andra to the hilt and 'edge' of what was then known as vampism) called Genuine who is not a vampire as the title may suggest, but actually  had been the high priestess of some cult.She ends up in a slave market featuring surprising revealing nudity, and is eventually bought by an eccentric old man who is prone to  doze off while being shaved daily, and who keeps the girl as a decorative souvenir in his mansion, as one can not possibly imagine his senility could be aroused to more action than admiring looks of worship. Whether the priestess arrived from a past life or the 'exotic' Middle East of 19th Century literature, is not clear.The first time we see Genuine she steps-off a portrait in the sitting-room, wearing an outrageous costume more pertaining to Hollywood High Drama than any epoch of antiquity, while gesturing an walking in an uncannily similar way to  Gloria Swanson descending the staricase in the very last scene of ""Sunset Boulevard"" where she believes she is Salom&eacute; in a De Mile epic. As an added feasture to the convoluted plot, the elderly gentleman has an Afro- Arabian servant, with painted bare chest, which looks like an unemployed extra from Diaghelev's Ballet Russe.The barber and another young man, a nephew? of the elder gentleman, are somehow driven mad with sudden-first-sight catastrophic passion for this creature. She appears with each one in such fantastical, bizarre costumes one would assume they both had a fetish for circus performers, while we also understand why some birds surely went extinct at this time with such lavish use of feathers. The barber cuts the older man's throat because she suggests it as a sacrifice to their love and then wants him to commit suicide as another proof of love... the details aren't very clear - particularly with respect to the old man's nephew or her relationship to the servant, that can be controlled with a 'magical' ring. At some point one of them rouses the populace against her in a frenzy by calling her a witch. They rush in a fury and attack and trample the Nubian at the doorstep of the mansion,  and in a scene which basically duplicates Cesare's fate from Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, she dies in the ensuing fracas after what looks like a short interpretative dance sequence.I would have preferred a burning at the stake myself as a happier ending. However the movie would probably make more sense in the full version. The costume changes that Genuine undergoes for every single scene are worth every second of watching this oddity. Ms. Andra gave camp lovers (and drag queens)  a solid and fertile basis for future developments with her showmanship, and at some moments in her performance she very much reminded me of the late Charles Busch in his Ridiculous Theater's production and interpretation of  Gustave Flaubert's ""Salamb&oacute;"", where he played the priestess to perfection in one of the most enchanting and absolute comical masterpieces of Contemporary theater that I was lucky enough to have seen, and remember always for its artistic and hilarious brilliance.",N/A

27390,"This is my favourite Kurosawa film. I tend to prefer (and relate) to more intimate, simple (or rather deceptively simple) films that deal with supposedly trivial human issues. Individuals as opposed to epic set pieces involving countries far and wide, war and political intrigue ... no thanks. One thing that can be said about Kurosawa's films is that, no matter the plot itself, they always deal with the characters themselves and not necessarily with the events going on on-screen.Drunken Angel is a straight-forward film that is existential at times (being an existentialist - completely out of favour with the enlightened majority nowadays I'm told - I support this aspect), but also frighteningly honest at times (not to say that existentialism isn't honest - far from it, but Kurosawa takes a side and makes a firm decision to support one side over the other, wherein the pure existentialist would parlay on behalf of both sides ... or neither).The film is of course strewn together with bits of symbolism and doomed fates intertwining and mingling between addictions and addictive personalities. The diseased pool omnipresent and sparkling with carrier mosquitoes while the children play near it unaware and joyfully uncaring, the drunken angel himself (Shimura) stuck amidst the cesspool forming an odd relationship with a young gangster (Mifune), perhaps seeing something of himself in that proud reckless face. Shimura is the anti-hero (one of Kurosawa's many anti-heroes), a flawed Samaritan who perhaps has found kindness in his doomed alcoholic state and seeks to form a fruitless one-sided friendship with another also doomed by the social criminal ladder of alcoholic proportions.This is Kurosawa depicting humanity in its raw quivering form, but doing so in an understated, tasteful way and not yieldingly or cowardly (as many ""controversial"" directors often attempt to do).The film ends with Shimura, the doctor, accepting what all doctors must accept, that he is only life's tool, he can only delay the inevitable. He must accept losing control, losing himself (or what he saw of himself in Mifune), to a force as powerful as addiction and as uncompromising. I wouldn't wish this realization on anyone and yet Kurosawa depicts it not in a sappy depressing way, but on realistic terms. It is what it is, there is no need for sorrow or regret, only acceptance and an infusion of meaning into the supposedly trivial things. For Shimura, perhaps its an alcoholic rejuvenation or perhaps it will be his salvation from that prison. Kurosawa, ever the realist, leaves that puzzle unfinished as it should be and Shimura and Mifune's fates end up being neither sad nor joyous, but simply meant to be.",Drunken Angel VHS

All the negative reviews spend a lot of time on the 'god' aspect.. but the show was never been subtle about religion.. NEVER.. So what were people expecting??..

1141830,"This series, translated from an Israeli prototype, takes us to the heart of psychotherapy. It stars Gabriel Byrne as Paul Weston, a somewhat rumpled and worn-out therapist, and six patients. Each 25-minute episode is a real-time view of a therapy session.The first patient is Laura, a sexy doctor about to split with her boyfriend who reveals in the first episode that she's in love with Paul. Next comes Alex, an African-American ace fighter pilot who accidentally killed 25 children in a school in Iraq. The most gripping patient is Sophie played wonderfully by Mia Wasikowska. She's a 15-year-old Olympic gymnast whose life has gone off the rails with a suicide attempt. Fourth are Amy and Jake, a couple whose marriage is falling apart. Finally, in the fifth episode, Weston seeks guidance and spars with Gina (Dianne Wiest), a former mentor with whom he has clashed in the past.We meet each of these characters nine times during the course of the season. Other peripheral characters -- Paul's unfaithful wife and kids, Sophie's mom -- occasionally drift into the action but basically we're stuck in Paul's cluttered office watching him fiddle with his glasses as his patients pour out their troubles.Occasionally, the translation from the Israeli-version strikes a false note. One anecdote is clearly drawn from the Holocaust. Transfering it to the South in the 1940s doesn't work. In another reference, one of the characters recalls the aroma of cakes baking on a Friday afternoon suffusing the apartment building of her youth. Yes, that happens in Israel on sabbath eve but not in America.At the end of this series, we learn that Paul is at least as screwed up as his patients and that psychotherapy often doesn't work. Only one of the patients makes real progress toward a recovery. The others either stew in their juices or get worse -- in one case much worse.Still, it's fascinating viewing, well-written and acted.",In Treatment: Season 1

1189502,"""Watchmen"" the film, has been a long-awaited and highly anticipated screen adaptation of the graphic novel.  The story begins in 1985 with Cold War tensions escalating and Nixon as President.  The Watchmen, once a group of costumed heroes/crime fighters, are now forced to sit back and watch the world come to the brink of a nuclear holocaust.  Or are they?  No...they aren't.  They suit up and do what they do best and try to put a stop to the impending nuclear war.The bottom line is that ""Watchmen"" is a fast-moving, visual feast that stays extremely faithful to the source material.  Director Zack Snyder kept an impressively dark vision in re-creating Dave Gibbons' illustrations.  Although some scenes were made shorter, some were cut out, others were enhanced, specifically action scenes that leave the viewer feeling very impressed.All the characters were exceptionally cast.  Patrick Wilson was perfect for Dan Dreiberg/ Nite Owl.  You will certainly keep your eyes glued to the screen when Laure Jupiter (Malin Akerman) makes an appearance, but even more so when she struts in her spandex costume as Silk Spectre.  Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) was a complete thrill to read in the novel, and continues that on screen.  The people in the film were in awe of Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), and you will be too when you see him.  The special effects for his character were incredible.So, who watches the ""Watchmen?""  You do.  Or rather you should.  And make sure you watch them in IMAX.  You won't be disappointed.",Watchmen

1214689,"**1/2Over the course of the last few decades, war movies have become so unflinchingly brutal and authentic in their depiction of life on the battlefield that they've become all but impossible to sit through - and I say this as a compliment, not as a denigration.  They SHOULD be impossible to sit through.  This IS war we're talking about after all.That being said, it should also be pointed out that ""The Miracle at St. Anna"" - a highly fictionalized account of an actual event - devotes only a minimal amount of time to carnage and bloodshed as it unfolds its story of four African-American soldiers (Laz Alonso, Derek Luke, Michael Ealy and Omar Benson Miller) trapped behind enemy lines in Italy during the closing days of WW II.  The film recounts their experiences with sympathetic villagers, anti-Fascist partisan fighters, Nazi soldiers (of both good and bad stripe), an orphaned boy they take under their wing and, of course, the requisite beautiful Italian peasant girl (Valentina Cervi) who wears tight sweaters and has a steamy encounter with one of the men.This latest work by Spike Lee certainly has its heart in the right place and there are scenes of undeniable intensity and power where he once again demonstrates his bona fides as a director of genuine vision and power (the brutal massacre of a group of unarmed villagers at the hands of the Nazis - the one truly nonfiction moment in the story - is the emotional high point of the movie).Yet, the movie, as a whole, adds up to much less than the sum of its parts, a victim of both overreaching and over-length (the movie takes a full two hours and 40 minutes to tell its story).  Interestingly, the screenplay by James McBride (based on his novel) suffers from trying to do too much and too little at one and the same time.  At some points, it seems as if he is doing his best to throw everything but the kitchen sink into the narrative mix, while, at others, the movie feels thin and underdeveloped, with the characters stuck for long stretches of time in a storyline that doesn`t seem to be going anywhere all that interesting or dramatic.  The diffuse and meandering plot drains the film of much of its narrative and emotional energy, and the movie is further hampered by the use of an uninteresting murder subplot - set in the 1980s - as an all too conventional framing device for the main story.  It is in these scenes, in particular, where Lee's grand opera style of filmmaking - bolstered by Terence Blanchard's melodramatic score - most threatens to fall over the edge into pretentiousness.  Moreover, the bathos and low comedy that frequently creep into the writing, as well as the fact that the four men seem more like clearly differentiated ""types"" than fully-rounded human beings, serve to undercut the generally fine performances by a large and gifted cast.Apart from the gripping war-is-hell scenes, ""The Miracle at St Anna"" is at its best when it's focusing on the bitter irony of men being called upon to do their patriotic duty of fighting and dying in a foreign land - all for a country that forces them to serve in black-only units in the field and to eat in segregated diners back home.  One of the characters even confesses, at one point, that he feels more ""free"" and accepted in Italy than he does in the United States.There's probably a first-rate two-hour-long movie buried somewhere in the midst of ""The Miracle at St. Anna.""  A pity Lee and McBride weren't able to fully ferret it out.",Miracle at St Anna

1207873,"Emotionally gripping!  A fantastic performance by Melissa Leo for the film FROZEN RIVER"" which has won numerous awards, each award is deserved because this film is simply well-acted and well-done.VIDEO & AUDIO:Video is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The video quality is very good during light conditions, especially during the outdoor segments.  But once you start getting indoors, you will see noticeable grain.  To be the truthful, the natural way the film is presented helps the storyline's presentation and its believability.The place is covered with snow and the main places where a lot of the film is shot is inside the trailer, inside a car and when you see the car drive through the snow during the day, early evening or late at night.  So, I was not expecting eye popping visuals but the Blu-ray video does enhance scenes such as the snow and the scenery in which the women have to go through a terrain but nothing but snow in order to accomplish their job.The audio is dialogue driven and is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  There was not need for any special effects and because of the locations, I wasn't expecting to hear any major uses of sound but the dialogue and the dialogue is quite clear and understandable.SPECIAL FEATURES:The main special feature for ""FROZEN RIVER"" is a audio commentary by Director Courtney Hunt and Producer Heather Rae.  The women discuss a lot about the film, the people they cast for the film, the performances of the characters and the music used in the film.  As well as discussion of the certain props that were used in the film.  There is quite a bit of pausing as both women are watching the film and seem to be engrossed in the overall storyline as well.I wish there was commentary with the talent or even a featurette with some behind-the-scenes filming of ""Frozen River"".""FROZEN RIVER"" is one of those films that one never expects to be created.  A storyline about a Caucasian woman and an Indian woman in dire circumstances and the only thing keeping them going is their love for their children.  Courtney Hunt did an extremely well-job in writing this story and then carrying it out on film as the director.Two important things that she manages to accomplish quite well is creating two characters that are genuine trying to survive but also realistically hiring actors that make the film seem natural.  Not Hollywood.  It's a glimpse into a world that we just do not see on film.But to watch two women from two different worlds and foregoing whatever they may think of each other or whichever prejudices they have and establish that working relationship and eventually a friendship because mutually they need each other in order for their children to be taken care of.  I found this chemistry between the two actresses powerful and how they were portrayed in a variety of emotional situations was well-done.I really have to applaud Courtney Hunt for doing her research and writing a touching, heartbreaking and yet gripping storyline and translating it well for film!  And Melissa Leo for her portrayal of a mother who has nothing left and she no choice but to use her last resort and Misty Upham for also making the film seem natural and real.As for the Blu-ray, the presentation at 1080p High Definition and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 is probably the best audio and video presentation that one will ever see of this film.  If anything, I wish there were more special features outside of the commentary but overall, for the film itself, knowing that ""FROZEN RIVER"" has been an award winner and has been received so well by critics, it was definitely a pleasure to finally watch this film.It's strength lies within the acting of the talent in the film not just by the main two actresses but even the children of Ray and everyone involved.  Everything seemed natural, not contrived or a Hollywood production.  It was a film that was well-written with great casting.""FROZEN RIVER"" is definitely a film worth watching!",Frozen River

The only person i liked in this movie was Alva (played by Maria Conchita Alonso).Nicholas Cage has definitely changed his voice because when it was in here and also in Valley Girl and Peggy Sue Got Married it was more higher pitched, now when you see him in a movie it's more deeper. And he does a terrible accent in this movie. His acting has gotten better because in here it's just lousy. He plays crazy well but in here it could have been better.He is a man named Peter Loew who is a publishing executive and he's bit by a vampire (or so he thinks) one night while he takes this woman Rachel (played by Jennifer Beals) home to his apartment for what he thinks will be casual sex, but while they are making out on his bed she bites him on the neck and then basically through out the film he terrorizes Alva when he's at work and he basically goes nuts. Rachel is not even real, she's a figment of his imagination. He finally gets to the point where he truly believes he's a vampire so he goes to a store and buys cheap fangs. Hmmm, okay. Then he goes in a park and catches a pigeon, takes it back to his apartment and eats it. It doesn't get better from there.Definitely not something i would want to watch again.",N/A

1194149,"Wonderfully creative and a fabulous great time to watch - best of the four Ice Age flicks.  I loved how the animators created the sense of size and weight of the Dino's.  This movie is definitely worthy of being the summer box office smash hit that it was, grossing 878.5 million worldwide.  Pixar, Disney, and Dreamworks can only ""wish"" they could produce a ""cash-cow"" like this movie for under 90 million.  I love some of the computer animated movies from those companies, as well.I saw Ice Age 3 for the first time when it came out on DVD.  I loved it. The movie had a very strong story but well-tempered by the comedy relief of Scrat, Scratte, & the Acorn. Speaking of the Scrat & Scratte scenes, this movie revived my interest in the classic song ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine,"" by Lou Rawls, which was used as a romantic backdrop in those scenes.  It is a beautiful song.  I remember seeing Lou Rawls sing it on TV when I was a kid.After renting this movie to see it for the first time, I purchased my own DVD copy on Amazon.I have the blu-ray version of this movie as well.

1190623,"What a great film!  Powerful, and educative at least for me, for being based on real events, the story is emotional, gripping, and infuriating.  The central character, Harvey Milk, is shown as intriguingly complex; so much so that there are lots of questions to ponder once the film is over.  Sean Penn's performance is brilliant.  The minor characters too are terrific - the actors had great material and lifted it further.Technically there's lots to admire - but perhaps the sum total is even more impressive than the parts, as the movie rips along at a cracking pace, and feels much shorter than its 129 minutes.The hope is as palpable as the hostility and the chaos, both personal and political, throughout ""Milk"" - it's one of those rare films that allows the audience to feel both the good and the bad in life, and is amazing in refraining from being overtly self-righteous.  Five stars, and deserves the Oscar.",Milk
327514,"Not having seen this for a long time, to watch it again now in widescreen on a big TV was a real treat. Its certainly as good as Dracula Prince of Darkness, though not as good as the original, which for me is the best Hammer film as made.The main reasons for its success are Freddie Francis direction, James Bernard for another classic score, and the films use of Christopher Lee. Unlike in the later sequels, in this film Lee has plenty to do and makes many appearances throughout the film. Interesting watching it for the first time on DVD it does look to me as though Christopher Lee was wearing a wig. Not that surprising since he was 46 years old when this was made.The film has a genuinely gothic feel to it, and although not in the least bit scary by todays standards, there are nevertheless one or two creepy moments. Of the rest of the cast Rupert Davies as the Monsignor is perhaps the best, in fact I would of like to have seen more of his character in the film.The only extra on the DVD is the original trailer. There are no commentaries or outtakes which is a pity.Its a shame that Peter Cushing didn't appear in the first two sequels. His presence would have improved the film. Nevertheless this is probably equal 2nd best with Dracula Prince of Darkness and gets 3.5 stars from me.",Dracula Has Risen From the Grave VHS

You may recognize him from many of Adam Sandler's films, notably ""The Wedding Singer"", where he plays Sammy, the friend who wears the Michael Jackson-esque outfits and drives a limousine.Anyway, ""Grandma's Boy"" is the story of man-child Alex, a 35 year old with a career as a video game tester.  Hijinks ensue when Alex is forced to move in with his loving grandmother, Lilly, (Doris Roberts of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" fame), and her two roommates.  Grace, (Shirley Jones), has the libido of a 20 year old and Bea, (Shirley Knight), is overmedicated to the point of bringing Terret's Syndrome-type humor to the mix.Alex, of course, does not want to admit that he lives with his grandmother, so he tells all of his friends/co-workers, including his sexy new boss, (Linda Cardellini), that ""three hot babes"" live with him.  But soon enough, the secret is revealed and the real fun begins.The real dilemma is presented though when a rival co-worker, J.P., (Joel Moore), with some serious identity issues is working against Alex to try and present a new and impressive video game idea that will increase his ego and make everyone else look like crap, as always.  But this year, Alex has a new plan up his sleeve that might make J.P. back down once and for all and look like the psycho he...well...already looks like...but worse!If you like stoner humor, karate-chopping chimps, men who talk like robots, pop culture references, drunken karaoke, unfortunate incidents with Lara Croft dolls and enough sexual innuendo to make the world go 'round, then you'll love ""Grandma's Boy"".

For the record, I also like the movie ""Meet the Baron"" and a couple of the Fox Laurel & Hardy movies; on the other hand I think ""Dancing Lady"" is very BORING, and I think ""Swing Parade"" is BEYOND boring and a terrible waste of talent, especially in the finale.  So that's where I stand...~  ~  ~The slap-dash manner of throwing in everything AND the kitchen sink is very entertaining to me.  After all, the script was a Rube Goldberg construction, and I don't think it lets us down as such.  Oddly, I did not care for the kitchen sink element of ""Hellzapoppin"", a contrived affair, whereas ""Soup to Nuts"" just seems breezily convoluted.The story moves along briskly with one colorful character popping up after another, and the jokes doggedly marching along.  If you don't like one gag, you'll laugh at the next.  Well, smile anyway...  Happily enough, there are indeed a number of Rube Goldberg's ""inventions"" on display throughout the film.The Three Stooges appear suddenly in the first shot of the movie, and the whole scene is very funny.  They sing and do the sand-bag routine that they would reprise in the 1950s on the Ed Wynn Show.  Here it is more logically framed and much better timed with a stronger ending.  I find Ted Healey very charming and funny, too.  His girlfriend (Frances McCoy) is perfect: darling and hilarious, and remains one of the great mysteries of film--absolutely nobody seems to know whatever happened to her!There is actually quite a lot of Stooges, and they have as merry madcap a fire department you could please.

152918,"I watched this movie after turning off The Ninth Gate. Compared with Polanski's plodding film, I found this refreshing, invigorating. There are visual effects reminiscent of Godard, Bergman, Cassavetes, Warhol. Very interesting. Some parts were lame, such as the gathering of female heads to discuss the prospects of the relationship between Eli and Max, but other scenes made up for this.In one scene the talking heads are discussing what to call the female genitals, and no one says the ""p"" word. That surprised me.The movie did seem a bit sanitized, like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. No bitchiness, no cruelty, no stealing your friend's girlfriend... The goodhearted confr&eacute;rie of lesbians was a little cloying.Finally, I ordered this film from Netflix because I thought it was by a filmmaker who made a legendary lesbian film in 1974. But her filmography says she is much younger. I ordered the wrong ""Go Fish"" by the wrong filmmaker.",Go Fish VHS

1124719,"Catacombs (Tomm Coker and David Elliott, 2007)Catacombs, as far as I could ever tell, was made expressly to give mediocre pop singer Pink some sort of entree into the film world. And if you look at it as nothing more than this, it succeeds, on the level that, well, Pink is on film, though she's an even worse actress than she is a singer. In every other way, however, the film is as absolute a failure as is possible, and its only real saving grace is that it's not the worst movie I've seen today (that honor would go to Dark Fields, which, despite us only being four days into the year, I am 90% certain will be one of the five worst movies I see in 2009).The pop tart and Shannyn Sossamon (Wristcutters: A Love Story) star as sisters. Pink is Carolyn, the wild one, currently enrolled in graduate school at the Sorbonne. Sossamon is Victoria, the staid undergraduate student with mental problems. Carolyn invites Victoria to France for a vacation, and as the movie opens, Victoria is arriving in Paris. Carolyn has plans to take Victoria to a rave in the catacombs; things get weird when Victoria, already away from her usual meds and having taken a dose of absinthe (and really, why is it that absinthe supposedly has these incredible qualities?), gets separated from Carolyn and her friends, and becomes convinced that a serial killer who lives in the catacombs, whom the group had been telling her about, is chasing her.The main problem with the movie is its pace; one wonders (or should) how the movie is going to continue on when everything you read about on the back of the box has already happened within the first twenty minutes, and you've still got seventy to go. Excellent question, and the answer is, ""the movie will bore you to tears as, essentially, nothing happens for sixty of those seventy minutes."" Then come the final ten, and while I admit to cheering a bit when Victoria reaches the obvious conclusion during the climactic scene, but honestly, did no one see that coming?As well, Coker and Elliott are another directorial team who have mistaken the idea that ""overly dark"" and ""atmospheric"" are identical, and thus about half the movie is very difficult to see. Brilliant. The acting is, at its best, competent (Sossamon is normally half-decent, but her role here mostly involves standing and screaming, running and screaming, and falling down and screaming). The big plot twist is painfully obvious from, oh, a minute and a half into the movie (or, if you're really not paying attention, you may not figure it out till half an hour or so), and while I admit that it's a good plot twist (in the sense that I was mutely cheering for Sossamon's character for actually making a halfway intelligent choice during the climax), the predictability of it did rather dull the fun. And, of course, as to be expected from any movie containing a mediocre pop singer, the soundtrack is horrific.Put me in mind of Sheitan, for some reason, except that Sheitan was good, and did eventually come up with a plot.

741883,"...""Footlight Frenzy""? it's a videotaping of a live stage performance by this same comedy group and it is a masterpiece of verbal, physical, situational and slapstick comedy. It only played briefly on HBO way back in 1980 and had a small release on VHS (RKO Video). If you like ""Bullshot"", your jaw will bounce off the floor for ""Footlight"".One joke example: (I won't go into the set up except to say a guy is on a stage in a play and has to drink a martini. He doesn't know that the water isn't working in the theatre so the stage manager just scooped some water out of the toilet for the prop. You can see that realization hit the actor when he pours it into his mouth. That's the set up.) He slowly turns until the hand holding the now empty martini glass is upstage, out of sight of the audience, holding it down at his hidden side. Slowly he leans over and lets the fluid dribble out of the corner of his mouth back into the glass down by his leg, not spilling a drop.) Brilliant. The whole thing is like that.Hopefully, someday, the Loan Moan Spectacular (the name of this comedy troup) will license the rights and it will become available again.

1204395,"Natalie Wood definitely deserves a tribute. This DVD box set, comprised of movies she made for Warner Brothers studio, is definitely a mixed bag. No one will argue that ""Bombers B-52"" or ""Cash McCall"" are especially memorable, or among Natalie's best work. That leaves us with two classics (""Splendor In The Grass"" and ""Gypsy""), one silly farce (""Sex And The Single Girl"") and one oddity that is interesting and worthwhile (""Inside Daisy Clover"").""Splendor In The Grass"" (1961) is easily the best film in this box set, and probably the quintessential Natalie Wood film. Deanie and Bud (Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty) are in love, but her mother (Audrey Christie) tells her that ""nice girls don't enjoy sex."" Deanie is confused, especially with the example of Bud's promiscuous and free-spirited sister Jenny (Barbara Loden) before her. Bud wants to stay on the family farm and marry Deanie, but his overbearing father (Pat Hingle) wants him to go to Harvard. Deanie's sexual repression leads to a dangerous suicide attempt at a waterfall (Natalie did the  frightening swimming scene herself) and mental breakdown. Natalie, who received an Oscar nomination, is an appealing mixture of poignancy and strength, and Warren Beatty is quite impressive in his film debut. ""Splendor"" holds up extremely well. If you don't believe me, just watch the terrible TV remake from the 1980's  with Melissa Gilbert, mis-cast and totally out of her depth, in Natalie's role. The original, with Natalie, is a classic. (5 Stars). 1961 was an excellent year, professionally, for Natalie. Following ""Splendor,"" she gave another beautiful performance, as Maria in the Oscar winning smash mega-hit ""West Side Story.""""Gypsy"" (1962): After having her vocals dubbed by Marni Nixon in ""West Side Story"", Natalie's singing is all her own in this film version of the Broadway classic. Natalie is perfect as Louise Hovac, whether  as a tomboy, dressed in baggy clothes with a page-boy haircut, or later, all woman, sexily stripping off as sophisticated Gypsy Rose Lee. Rosalind Russell is just fine (with vocal help from Lisa Kirk) as her ambitious, driven, and delusional, Mama Rose. I certainly did not miss the hideous Broadway hag known as Ethel Merman. (4 Stars out of 5).""Sex And The Single Girl"" (1964) Tony Curtis, working for a smutty tabloid magazine, is determined to prove that Natalie Wood, as ""sexpert"" Dr. Helen Brown, is actually (Gasp!) a virgin! Whether she is or not is never anwered.This ridiculous sex farce soon runs out of steam and becomes a slapstick farce, with a wildly prolonged car chase on the freeway. (3 Stars Out of 5).""Inside Daisy Clover"" (1965) By age 26, Natalie Wood is too adult to be entirely convincing as a 15 year old ""child singing star"", but she does have the Hollywood credentials. The page boy haircut that worked so well in ""Gypsy"" does not work so well for ""Daisy Clover."" Daisy is supposed to be a singing sensation, in the mode of  a teenage Judy Garland. Natalie's vocals are dubbed by another lady again. Marni Nixon's dubbing for Natalie in ""West Side Story"" was well-done. The dubbing for Natalie in ""Daisy"" (not Marni Nixon) is bad...well, honestly, awful!Everything else about the film seems a bit off, too. Gavin Lambert's script veers wildly between macabre black comedy, satire, and melodrama. The best performances are given by Robert Redford as Wade Lewis, the ""closeted"" gay matinee idol who encourages Daisy's rebellious nature, marries her, and promptly abandons her; and an especially effective and creepy Christopher Plummer as ""Prince Of Darkness"" movie mogul Raymond Swan. In Natalie's best scene, she has an altogether too convincing and frightening nervous breakdown inside a recording booth. The overall film is uneven, but worthwhile and interesting, nevertheless.(3 Stars Out of 5).",N/A
1220610,"Based on Cornelia Funke's novel, Inkheart presents a supremely fascinating concept with limitless possibilities - unfortunately the direction it takes falls into the predictable realm of formulaic fantasy (it's as if a quota must be reached for daring escapes, rescue attempts and damsels in distress). The basic plot is as convoluted and faulty as time travel, and without very finite ground rules, the details and conclusion feel contrived - unnaturally forced in order to neatly right the predicaments. Several characters are wasted and the most adventurous avenues are left completely unexplored, but for a fun-filled fantasy film Inkheart isn't entirely a letdown. First-rate special effects and well-paced action put this inventive picture well above the utter failures of Eragon or The Seeker.Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart (Brendan Fraser) has a rare magical gift that allows him to bring to life anything he reads out loud from a book. It's more complicated than it sounds - when he reads aloud, the elements in each passage are transported into his current location, as if directly from the world defined in the book, and someone from his own time is sent into the book in exchange. This implies that every written story must create an environment that exists on a unique timeline, and that those creations exist somewhere in three dimensions. Further confusion is introduced when one of the characters Mo brings to life (or rather out of the book's life) worries about how his story will end, hinting that each book also has a timeline concurrent with present time - and later that the characters in books can change the course of their destiny, even though it's cemented in unchanging printed words.Mo's troubles start because he is unaware he has such an ability (humans with this skill are known as Silvertongues). He reads the story of Inkheart to his young daughter and wife, unleashing the dastardly villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis), along with the roguish fire-juggling Dustfinger (Paul Bettany). Mo's wife vanishes and Capricorn sets about building himself an army of storybook henchmen. Mo vows never to read another book out loud and so twelve years pass without incident. His daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) has grown up and wonders about Mo's obsessive quest to obtain another copy of the Inkheart book to try and correct his decade-old error. When he finally finds another copy in an antiquarian bookshop, Dustfinger reappears, begging the Silvertongue to return him to his world; when Mo refuses, the ilk of Capricorn is summoned to force compliance.There are well-intentioned themes (involving the power of reading and writing among others) floating around in the story of Inkheart, but the film fails to fully illustrate the creativity of the major concepts. The villains are of course unthreatening (this is a kid's movie after all), Helen Mirren's supporting role is wasted, and each of the characters is designed in the most generic manner. For a plot that is already incredibly outlandish and difficult to accept, it's odd to cast Brendan Fraser, who brings an instant air of goofiness and tongue-in-cheek humor to a character that would have been more effective if played seriously.In one scene a Silvertongue is forced to read out of various books to prove her skill; as the camera pans across the room the audience can see Cinderella's glass slipper, Huckleberry Finn's raft, a gingerbread house from Hansel and Gretel, the Sword in the Stone and many more recognizable storybook entities. It's at this moment, with countless novels at the creator's disposal, that we acknowledge the biggest disappointment: imagining what could have been. What an amazingly unique concept with such mediocre execution.- Mike Massie",Inkheart (DVD)

1162767,"Review of the Uncut HK version.Amid the beloved historical epic tales of the ""Battle or Romance of the Three Kingdoms"", arose three movies in 2008. The very mediocre ""Empress and the Warriors"" with Donnie Yen, and late last year came the first chapter of John Woo's ""Red Cliff"". Daniel Lee's (Dragon Squad) ""Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon"" was released a few months earlier in Asia than Woo's star-studded film (which I will review later), and has Hong Kong's Andy Lau (Running on Karma) in the lead as the famous General Zhao Zhilong--yes the same guy in the video game named Zhao Yun in ""Dynasty Warriors"". The film has massive commercial appeal, and the film is beautifully shot. However, purists of the tales of the Three Kingdoms will be annoyed and repulsed, as the film does feel a little empty in regards to an intricate storyline and full of historical inaccuracies. (Hint: John Woo's overly exaggerated film about the three kingdoms isn't much better)228 A.D, before the rise of the Jin Dynasty. The kingdoms of Shu, Wei and Wu are divided. Zhilong (Andy Lau) is a simple soldier from Changsan who becomes a legendary warrior under the employ of Liu (Yueh Huah) who rises from the ranks of the Shu forces to become one of the ""Five Tiger Generals"". Zhilong becomes famous for his many campaigns against Cao and the last surviving general of the ""Five Tigers"". Now, after many years of war, Zhilong is set to make his last stand against Cho's granddaughter--who has become a beautiful, cold and stoic warrior woman; Cao Ling (Maggie Q, Live Free and Die Hard).The film is narrated by Pingan (Sammo Hung), Zhilong's oldest friend who joined the Liu army with him many years ago. The film is supposed to cover thirty years, Zhilong was a simple soldier who ascends to become a simple general and so the film feels a little too short. There are a lot of plot holes and several important parts missing, but then as a tale being narrated by Pingan who remained a simple soldier in the ranks, I can accept its shortcomings. Pingan never became a part of Zhilong's military unit until his final campaign. The viewer is privy to Zhilong's achievements through the musings of humble Pingan and it is rather hard for Sammo Hung to carry this burden, and purists will undoubtedly become disconnected. Zhilong is a renowned general in the Shu kingdom, he may be remembered as the ""Spartan"" of the Liu army--truly legendary and whose name struck fear in the hearts of his enemies.Thankfully, Andy Lau does turn in a great performance and I am happy to say he isn't miscast. This may well be his best performance since his role in ""The Warlords"" with Jet Li. The plot may be a little too simple and doesn't reach Zhilong's epic grandeur, but Lau does the best of what he's got; Lau is playing a larger-than-life character and despite the simple plot, he manages to project the character competently. Maggie Q. is alluring as Cao Ling, and despite her limited screen time, she was exciting and enchanting to watch. The rest of the supporting cast isn't so bad, but we all have to remember that this is a film with Zhilong as its central focus.Aside from the Pingan narrations, the real problems begin when the film has some ""add-on"" characters played by two lesser known performers in the persona of Vanness Wu, and Andy On; they seem to be mere attempts to give the young stars some exposure. (Maggie Q. is just so hot, I don`t mind her at all)  A lot of folks would be interested to see this film because of  truly iconic characters played by accomplished actors such as Sammo Hung, Yueh Hua, Ti Lung, Chen Zhihui; but sadly the film does nothing with them. Zhilong may be the center of the film but all others, disappear after the first half. This film definitely needed to be longer and the significance of the other four ""Tiger Generals"" to Zhilong a little more fleshed out.The action sequences have the usual style of Chinese epics and reminiscent of other films of this kind. The choreography by Yuen Tak is fairly good, although it looked too flashy for my tastes. (as with Woo's ""Red Cliff') The shots are cool and well-choreographed, a blend of the usual wire-fu, wild slow-mo and blood and some gore. Highlights include Zhilong rescuing Liu's son, (which was fairly exciting) and the fight between Cao Ling and Zhilong were very cool to watch. The fights provide great eye candy, but that's all they were; pure eye candy. The film does have a lot of action, it feels more like an action drama and abandons the contemplative nature of the horrors of war.(although it does touch on this idea a little in the final act) Writer/director Daniel Lee does an average job in mixing in emotions and action, but it felt that it reduced its visceral effect. The film has colorful, elaborate costumes and some beautiful cinematography that it will no doubt attract mainstream audiences.""Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon"" isn't a bad film, and I rather thought that this may be Daniel Lee's best work. It is a lot better than the abysmal ""Empress and the Warriors"" and I've seen John Woo's ""Red Cliff"" and believe me, Woo's first take on the ""Three Kingdoms"" period was better but only by a tad. The lore and legend of the Three Kingdoms isn't fully fleshed out, and the film does resort to flashy camera tricks and choreographed action sequences. While this may not be exactly be a bad thing, and will no doubt give the non-meticulous viewer a good diversion, purists of its historical significance will be very disappointed since it isn`t as intricately compelling as I wished it to be. The film never does delve into wartime strategy that much and falls to the usual epic trappings of honor, betrayal and fate. This film has massive commercial appeal but quite respectable in its quality. ""Three Kingdoms"" is indeed an entertaining experience, but not outstanding and manages to exude coolness throughout--but isn't war supposed to be ""un-cool""?Another one for the overindulgent International audience for beautiful Chinese epics.Recommended!

There's almost no humor whatsoever. It's like the writers are desperately holding on to the episodes that are now considered some of the best of the series, and recycled the same plotlines for a film, and not bothering to take the time to include any actual *jokes*. That's honestly the impression I got after watching Bender's Big Score.It's not completely mediocre- I mean, there's still several segments of the movie that feature solid writing and some great animation (sometimes AMAZING animation even) and there's several moments that definitely bring a smile to my face at least (mostly because they bring back memories of the glory days of the show).But the storyline and the pacing feel VERY predictable and significantly less funny compared to the style that was presented to us with the series.I thought the Simpsons Movie was a bit of a letdown compared to the show (older AND newer episodes) and I'm afraid if Bender's Big Score is any indication, Futurama may be following in the same footsteps.The characters we've come to love from the show are all featured in the movie, but it's like they constantly blurt one a bunch of one-liners throughout the film *just* for the purpose of making an appearance in the movie.

The basic premise is that of an interpol agent who's frustrated by the lack of autonomy in delivering justice and trapped in a world of corporate corruption - well, he doesn't quite turn Clint Eastwood if that's the movie you're looking for.Still the International makes for a fascinating enough experience.  I enjoyed this (and I am neither a Clive Owen and Naomi Watts fan) because I wanted to see how it would play out.  Would the big bad bank win?  Would Clive exact revenge?  etc - There were many possible scenarios that this could have played out - and it's only fault perhaps is not deepening the suspense enough and going the Film Noir route,  although all the ingredients of a thriller are certainly present.  At least it tries to be more unique than some other movies.  For that, I give it an A for effort and B+ for execution.Timing has been a good factor for the film as mentioned - since corporate greed is on the loose, and banks it seems are bankrupting the world...this is not a deep treatise on that sort of thing, but it certainly resonates with the audience!I'm hoping that the DVD will have extended scenes, which will possibly heighten the intrigue...this is a movie that could have snaked a little bit more and kept us gripped to our seats.

As a RABID Kansas fanatic, I have everything from the band available and, while I was looking forward to this DVD already, like alot of people, I was somewhat ""worried"" how the voice of the great Steve Walsh would hold up after all these years (I would assess his voice at about 20% of its potential on ""Live At the Whisky"", about 20-40% on both ""Freaks Of Nature"" & ""Always Never The Same"", about 60% on ""Somewhere to Elsewhere"", and at around 60-80% on their last major DVD ""Device Voice Drum"" [although the strain and effort was still noticeable throughout all releases, even if is less noticeable on most of the new songs which one doesn't have the obvious option of comparing prior versions. Funny enough, Walsh sounds 100% live in concert, but I digress]). Well, I have to tell you, he sounds fantastic: 100% or darn close to it and, when one considers his age and the fact this is a LIVE document, not to mention his prior uneven recorded output as of late, I am even MORE impressed (so, yes: we can all get over our ""vocal"" obsessions with ""Two For The Show"" LOL)! As for the music and other musicians: outstanding, as always (and nice to see ""Ghosts"", ""Rainmaker"", and ""Musicatto"" in the set!). In fact, without the intentionally grainy film look of ""Device Voice Drum"" to 'hamper' things, I believe strongly that this is their greatest live document to date (honorable mention: the fantastic and out of print VHS only release ""The Best of Kansas"" from 1983 [Omaha, July 1982, John Elefante; A+ show]). And, with the guest appearances of the great Kerry Livgren and Steve Morse, what more could a fan ask for? Ok, it would have been nice to see John Elefante step out of the wings and perform ""Play the Game Tonight"" (and even have ole Robby come back for a song or two), but you can't have it all. Bottom line: get this asap!!!!",N/A
1087075,"Alright Huntress aka Ashley Scott and Oracle were very well cast and Harley Quinn was AMAZING as a villain and I loved the concept. I've always preferred this storyline in which Batman and Catwoman have a child, but the main issue with the show was the EXTREMELY low budget and they didn't give Huntress a mask, that could have basically given her the mask Black Cat wears and it would have worked. Without the secret Identity Factor the hero plot failed. The first episode, and the last are probably the best. Um hated Black Canary's daughter, but she had cool powers but the actress sucked. I mean if you like batman, buy this, Batman was suppose to guest star in the second season if they had one, but the show wasn't give a chance and they just goofed on the secret identity. Wish they would revamp the show with many corrections, the concept has such great potential. Owell I still re-watch the episodes, they tend to be a little cheesy, but oracle wears the Batgirl costume quite a few times in the show and the costume looked great, not cheesy at all. Totally worth buying even to see the unaired pilot with a different actress playing Harley.",Birds of Prey:CSR (DVD)

It would take me years to find out why the show was so important.All grown up, I myself found my little 'Upstairs, Downstairs' of my own.'The Bretts' was briefly shown in the USA, and not all of the episodes were aired. I enjoyed what i saw, and even recorded it on VHS as at times was not able to see it first hand on Sunday nights due to obligations.When the last episode was aired, it kinda left a bad taste in my mouth, as i knew the show did not end properly.Here, in one set, i got the episodes I recorded, plus the remaining episodes that tied up the many holes left with what i thought was the end.The show is very LAVISH, and i am downplaying that. The acting is no less than superb, with more than capable actors actually making me believe this is all going on in front of me.As a child, i took Masterpiece Theater and Mystery! for granted, and didn't watch what people were reguarding as classic and important viewing.

Leading the story is David Boyeur (HarryBelafonte), a homegrown revolutionary, whose skin is his country... But the issue here is not just one of color... The issue here is who is really best fit to represent the people in the colorful island? Who knows them the best? Who feels for them the most? Who's really a part of them? On the other hand, one of the other important fights, for Boyeur, is against tradition as Santa Marta shackles with traditions...Sizzling around the edges is Mavis Norman (Joan Fontaine) who happens to be in love with this charismatic leader... Mavis Norman feels that he is superior to most men...As a public figure, there is Maxwell Fleury (James Mason) who seeks the election to revenge himself upon the whites whom he now thinks despise him... Fleury is ready to use the black people so that he can still rule in that world that he still belongs to...Delving into his personal life, we see him jealous of Hilary Carson (Michael Rennie), the gentlemanly English drifter... Fleury envies him because he thinks that his wife (Patricia Owens) is attracted to him... Blind by love, he thinks that his wife had fall in love with Carson who is better suited to her...There is also Euan Templeton (Stephen Boyd), the governor's son, who wants to be married before he goes back to England...

Colonel Whittingham considers the murderer not strong enough to bear the burden of his guilt...

34925,"Carole Lombard's second-last movie before her tragic death, MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941) saw her under the direction of Alfred Hitchcock and paired with the devilishly handsome Robert Montgomery.After Ann and David Smith (Lombard and Montgomery) discover their wedding wasn't in fact legal, the obvious solution, to Ann at least, is to quickly get married again.  But to her horror, David seems quite relaxed about the whole affair.  Ann's mind tracks back to a recent conversation where she asked David about marriage and whether he'd do everything the same if he ever got a second chance.  His reply was to remain a bachelor instead!Ann storms out of the ""marriage"", takes up her maiden name and starts dating David's strait-laced business partner (Gene Raymond); whilst David tries every trick in the book in his quest to win her back.While this was a real change-of-pace for Hitchcock, the comedy genre wasn't completely new territory for the director, having helmed some enjoyable silents in the comedy vein like ""The Farmer's Wife"" in 1928 (and when you think about it, most of his films had some degree of comedy or a knowing comic sensibility to them).MR. & MRS. SMITH was directed as a favour to Carole Lombard, with whom Hitchcock had recently struck up a friendship.  Professionally, Ms. Lombard was firing on all cylinders, delivering some of her finest work.  She was beginning to find her feet in dramatic movies (like ""They Knew What They Wanted"" and ""Vigil in the Night"", both filmed in 1940); and was also preparing for what would be her last role, as Maria Tura in Ernst Lubitsch's comedy ""To Be or Not to Be"".  In 1942, Lombard and her mother were both killed in a plane crash, on it's way back from a war-bonds drive.MR. & MRS. SMITH is one of the screwiest (and most subversive) screwball comedies you'll ever have the pleasure of seeing.  Highly recommended.",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS

This film shot in 1973 is fast-paced and features action-packed scenes like no other, from start to finish the intensity never lets go 'til the fatal ending.

1189397,"First Thing....i never read the comic, but was interested in the following that this franchise brings. quite the hype, i must say.I'm actually very torn about this movie, i like it in general but there's alot i dont understand and will have to rewatch it to get everything.It was too long, I bought the blu ray directors cut, because i always feel like i'm getting ripped off if i buy the theatrical version. I wanna see the film the way the director intended not what they edited out for theatrical viewing. Regardless it was too long and alot could have been taken out and the impact would have been the same. at least for me.Alot of people are not happy about the amount of violence in this movie. I didnt find the violence as graphic as people are making it out to be. I'm sure everyone has seen a horror movie before so i dont know what the big deal is here. The rating is ""R"" for ""graphic violence, Sexuality, nudity, and language."" Bottom line: Read the Warning/Rating before watching the movie.Second thing people are not happy about is the Full Frontal Nudity of John Manhattan. Big deal, really. We've been looking at women naked for years. Aside from that, the nudity was done very very tastefully. Never once was the nudity used in a sexual situation. It brought beauty to the male form that no film has ever was able to do. I applaud the director for bringing that into the film in such a graceful natural way.Really everyone, if you don't want to see this stuff, watch the theatrical version. thats why its available.I guess i rate it 4 stars as i'm so intrigued by the characters and the storyline and watching this film in blu way was wonderful. A great example of what Blu Ray should be.",Watchmen

1110801,"Universal Pictures, as fans of the horror genre well know, was the leader in this type of film. I grew up on their movies when ""Shock Theatre"" debuted on WCAU-TV in Philly back in the 50s when I was in high school. (The first two films they showed were FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA, two of my favorites to this day.) In this collection, there were only two films -- CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN and HORROR ISLAND -- that I'd never seen before, and some of the others I hadn't seen since the 50s. For fans of Universal, this set is highly recommended. And as my title for this review indicates, I hope this is just the first of many such collections. (I'd like to think that one day there will be a complete Boris Karloff set or a complete Bela Lugosi set. I'd like to hope there will never be a complete Lon Chaney, Jr., set, however!)One thing puzzles me, though: The cover art for the inside DVD holder shows Boris Karloff from some movie in the 50s. Not only is whatever that film might be from the wrong era (the others all being from 1941-1943), but Karloff isn't even in any of the films in this set.

150863,"Dodsworth is one of those rare monumental movies that strike an emotional chord with audiences by focusing on delicate subject matter way ahead of its time. It is a masterful examination of love and romance being affected by both aging and differences in age and a heavy-hitting reflection on second chances and preserving youth, all conducted in tear-jerking seriousness. Amazing performances, unforgettable moments and sensational music make Dodsworth one of the greatest romantic dramas of all time.After 20 years of both marriage and success as a great industrialist, Samuel Dodsworth (Walter Huston) sells off Dodsworth Motors and plans to make a new life in retirement, learning how to enjoy leisure. He's thrilled to take a cruise to Europe with his wife Fran (Chatterton) who is chiefly concerned with staying young and preserving her ideals of youth. Sam is easily entertained with the friendly people and simple tourist attractions, but Fran feels stifled by his old-fashioned outlook and begins to drift away - flirting with a captain (David Niven) and the smooth-talking Iselin (Paul Lukas) and finally attracting the attentions of a Baron (Gregory Gaye). When Sam wishes to return to their comfortable hick hometown of Zenith, she can only think of her high class friends and his unimpressive bourgeois ideas.Sam returns to his home companionless to learn that his daughter Emily will be having a baby - and that he's dreadfully lonely without the wife he's always loved. In a last attempt to win her back, he resorts to ruthless measures to catch Fran cheating - and although guilt drives her to him, they soon grow even further apart. Even her joy of hearing about Emily's new child is lessened when Dodsworth hints at their new grandparent status. When Fran finally demands a divorce so she can wed the Baron, Sam is consumed with grief and weightily journeys around Europe to forget - and luckily reunites with a widowed acquaintance (Mary Astor) who is familiar with his marital woes. (The most affecting scene in the film is when Sam boards a train after Fran announces her plans to wed - and bids farewell with an absolutely heartbreaking, disillusioned sentimental remark.)It's heart-wrenching and poignant and very serious in its approach to dramatic romance. The plot may sound like a soap opera, but the acting and execution is absolutely perfect. The hero must undergo great emotional torment in his journey to re-discovering the excitement he never achieved with his younger wife. But Dodsworth is a film that knows how to win over audiences - not only does it think of appropriate happiness for the lead, it also insists upon total destruction for the wrongdoer; typical Golden-Age Hollywood influence that orders standing-ovation resolutions.- Mike Massie",N/A
1194620,"This film has more holes than my Kuru-riddled brain.Treating a pernicious industry like the sex-slave-trade in a comic-book fashion is ludicrous and irresponsible. I've lived in SE Asia, working not in but alongside crusaders fighting this sorry malignancy. I know...it's only a movie. It's only the well from which our culture draws its knowledge.The good guy (Liam) has less dimension than a straight line: he is simply not believable and thus is never engaging. Liam is always liam, whether in kilts, Jedi rags, WWII garb, Les Mis stripes, or chaps. Abysmal, our movie icons.Anyway, the bad guys are NEVER shown being brutally bad, thus there is little reptilian satisfaction in their roastings, plumbings and guttings. Being one of the largest money-making businesses in the world, all of its prime-movers and lick-spittles are not morons, surely.The film allows the viewer to know only a spoiled, perfidious, reckless teen-aged daughter...so where's the emotional investment for her plight?Her mother (bitter-bitchy-ignorant but beautiful and shapely) is ex to Prozac-Crack-Liam, trophy-wife to handsome, rich-as-Croesus indulgent step-sugar daddy? No stereotypes here. Briefcase full of valid passports, ID's in reflections, homicidal trucks, venal trusted friends, etc...all original themes.The final rewards are delivered at the endings (2)...landing at LAX, without a warm and fuzzy welcome from Interpol and the FBI? A singing audition for the air-headed kid? Did she learn nothing? Obviously a product of our public schools.Come on, Hollywood, work on your introductions and endings (and everything in between). For instance, how the hell did they get off the yacht (with the other girls...he can't hand them over to the authorities) and out of France, severely wounded, with the miscreants and the police hot on their spoor? There is a good story there. A great story. Getting back across the Pond and into the US without the daughter's passport could have been another challenge...well, all right, fictionalize THAT challenge. And finally, disappearing into the fabric of LA/USA/upper Chad with reasoned vigilance and disabling paranoia would have been a reasonable exit.You may enjoy the ride until there is a synaptic snap somewhere higher than your mesencephalon. If not, mark your territory again, just in case your essence is growing faint. Rehydrate yourself with another brew.The reason I bothered reviewing the thing is because I enjoyed it on a visceral level. This one got derailed in the first few minutes...quite an accomplishment.",Taken
609460,"My whole family loves this movie. None of us knew what to expect when we first watched it except it starred Shia LaBeouf who we loved from the tv show Even Stevens. What a delightful surprise we got! The movie, based on the equally wonderful book by Louis Sachar, is an oddball tale about a bunch of oddball people. Stanley Yelnats comes from a long line of losers who blame their lackluster lives on a family curse. Adolescent Stanley, wrongly convicted of stealing a pair of sneakers, is sent to the ironically named Camp Green Lake, a work camp where juvenile delinquents are rehabilitated based on the dubious theory that a bad boy can be turned into a good boy by being forced to dig deep holes in the hot sun all day. Stanley meets Zero, an illiterate, homeless misfit, and the two of them embark on a strange adventure involving poisonous lizards, a bandit called Kissin Kate Barlow, a lipstick tube, and some antique canned peaches. Yes, I know how bizarre that sounds, but the movie seemlessly weaves these disparate threads together into a compelling, entertaining, funny, and moving story that shows nobody should be dismissed as a loser.

114233,"I saw this picture when it was first released to theaters in glorious CinemaScope and stereophonic sound and at the time it was impressive indeed.  As time when on though, a few things about it bothered me a little:The appearance of the ""Id monster"" has a definite animated look, as indeed it was as provided by one of the Disney animators on loan-out to MGM.  The animated ray under the landing spaceship from Earth also doesn't look believable.Morbius points to the three-cornered opening as a ""characteristic arch"" of the Krell.  Those sharp corners would be seen immediately as stress concentrations by any engineer worth his salt going right back to the ancient Romans.  Obviously intended as something that would ""look different"".  Britain's first jet-liner, the de Havilland Comet had sharp cornered windows which caused the fuselage to crack and go to pieces in mid-flight and that was the end of that model.When Morbius demonstrates the recording made by Krell musicians thousands of years ago, it sounds exactly the same as the electronic tonalities we've been hearing all through the picture, so it doesn't have the impact it should.When Morbius has the Captain (Leslie Nielsen) fire his ray gun to test the strength of the Krell door,  Nielsen fires and then walks up to the door and comments that ""this spot should be molten"".  But he is pointing to a spot more than a foot away from where his ray supposedly struck it.Actually I like this picture a lot and these quibbles are mainly in fun.  For its time it was the Cadillac of science-fiction films - somethiing you would expect from MGM.  I""ll probably want to see the Blu-ray, but I'm afraid the landscapes of the planet Altair 4 will look more than ever like painted backdrops.p.s.  Well, the Blu-ray version of this classic did finally show up and I bought it and I'm very pleased with the upgrade-- especially the improvement in audio.  Filmed in CinemaScope, it had three channel stereophonic sound which is faithfully rendered in the Blu-ray version.  The video quality (as I predicted above) does show the details of where the sets end and the painted backdrops begin -- similar the the Blu-ray version of  ""The Wizard of Oz.""

Fortunately, the film respected it's source material and contains one powerful visual after the next.  The film is perfectly cast, very well acted, and adequately written.  When you have such a descriptive book as ""The Road"", it's hard to capture everything - and the film does a good job but doesn't completely succeed.  Without spoiling the ending, I will just say I think the emotional sting the book leaves is better than the film.

It's certainly not for everyone, but for fans of the book, it's a nice companion.",N/A

The Ultimate Upper Body section lives up to its name, because I got an effective workout for my arms and the rest of my upper body.

They are on a road trip to drive cross country from Florida to California, without any money or credit cards, having to live off the kindness of strangers.

233668,"In his second western as a director and star, Clint Eastwood made a classic with his 1976 western The Outlaw Josey Wales.  Early in the Civil War, Missouri farmer Josey Wales sees his family murdered and farm burned down.  Looking for revenge, he joins a guerilla outfit of Confederate cavalry, wreaking havoc on Union forces.  But late in the war, the rest of the outfit is massacred when trying to surrender, with Josey and one other man escaping the bloodbath.  The duo head west into the Indian Nations and then Texas with a bloodthirsty major on his trail.  Making the chase worse, a $5,000 bounty has been placed on Josey's head causing anyone who can handle a gun to be on the lookout for him.  By 1976, Eastwood was a western icon, and he puts it all together here as director and star.  It's a great story, plenty of action, some humor and great one-liners, and a great supporting cast.  Eastwood's best American western right there with Unforgiven, give Josey Wales a shot if you've missed it!Playing one of his more complicated characters, Eastwood is Josey Wales, the outlaw on the run.  Wales is both a killer and a protector as people begin to join him on the trail.  Eastwood is great in the part as a more humane but still deadly gunfighter.  Chief Dan George is perfectly cast as Lone Watie, an old Cherokee man who travels with Wales.  A friendship develops between the men who share more in common than you might think.  Sondra Locke plays Laura Lee, a young woman Josey rescues from a gang of Comancheros and starts to have feelings for him.  John Vernon and Bill McKinney are the two very different villains, Fletcher, a man who saw his men massacred and is forced to hunt down Wales, and Terrill, a bloodthirsty major looking to finish off the outlaw. Paula Treuman, Sam Bottoms, and Geraldine Kearns also have good parts as some of Josey's traveling companions.  And check out these small supporting parts that include Woodrow Parfrey, Joyce Jameson, Royal Dano, Will Sampson, Matt Clark, John Russell, Charles Tyner, John Davis Chandler, John Quade, and Sheb Wooley.The DVD is a steal with a widescreen presentation that looks great and a handful of special features.

He was a dynamic, feisty, fearless rebel who moved and talked like the genius he was.The book starts off with Roark being kicked out of college because he refused to compromise his dreams of becoming not a good architect, but a great one.When Warner Brothers announced it had brought the movie rights to Ayn Rand's landmark novel, many in the film colony saw the Howard Roark part as a shoo-in for rebel-in-residence John Garfield. Charismatic, intense, gorgeous, a brillant artist, he had already created a niche in movies with his bad boy, smart, edgy roles,like the one in the Joan Crawford hit, ""Humoresque"" where he proved unforgettable as the troubled, snarling master violinist, Paul Boray.Cooper's image in private and on screen was that of a laconic, good-natured boy-next-door who might have parked his horse outside. Very rarely did he move or talk fast and his style was slow-moving and sleepy. In his role of Howard Roark he looks like the grandfather of the young rebel. Probably one of the most excruitiating scenes on film is Roark's big courtroom speech. Cooper resembles an old man, or an ageing cowpoke,whose wandered onto the wrong set, reading text off a teleprompter and at times his eyes bug out at some of the really high tone philosophy that author Ayn Rand wrote.Cooper was later to say that he understood nothing aboutt the script or his role.  Director King Vidor was later to write that he was appalled by the casting because equally badly cast was Patricia Neal in the juicy role of Roark's love interest--icy, brilliant, surreal Dominique Francon. Neal was a pretty, fresh-faced ingenue who photographed well.Again, many in the film colony thought Ida Lupino was the perfect actress for the role. She was considered the ""poor man's Bette Davis"" and had turned in extraordinary performances in ""They Drive By Night"" and ""The Hard Way."" Rand said she wrote the Dominique Francon character and later the Dagney Taggart personae in ""Atlas Shrugged"" with Greta Garbo in mind. But Garbo had already quit movies. Barbara Stanwyck was so obsessed with starring in The Fountainhead that she gave studio mogul, Jack Warner a copy of the book with a note saying she ""was born"" to play Dominique Francon.Cooper can't be entirely faulted for his fatal miscasting. Ayn Rand actually pushed for him to be cast. This was an era when the tiny circle of super stars truly believed their own immortality. Stars like Cooper were brainwashed to think ""their fans"" would love them in any role. Because the Howard Roark role was considered ""hot,"" every male star lobbied for it. Cooper probably was elated and thrilled to have snatched this prize from under the noses of his cohorts. Unfortunately, his hideous mistake and all of those who supported his casting will live forever on DVD and Turner Classic Movies.",The Fountainhead VHS

Unfortunately these story changes make Meryl Streep's character much more pleasant than in the book and this detracts from the impact of the film.I can help feeling as well that, good as Anne Hathaway was, Emily Blunt would have been far more convincing in the lead part.All the main actors are excellent and even a jeans and t-shirt male like me who normally despises 'fashion', was caught up with the characters and their hopes and fears.",N/A
1252618,"The first 20 minutes were taut, well acted and, overall, fantastic. Unfortunately, I had to enjoy much of the remainder of the movie with my eyes closed, due to the camerawork. The movie was filmed, documentary-style, with hand-held cameras. You'd be hard-pressed to find a steady outdoor scene in the entire film, that didn't play tug-of-war with your equilibrium. Not the best friend of anyone susceptible to motion sickness, like me.I was so incredibly queasy that I couldn't even get up to leave the theater (like I did during the Blair Witch Project), though I noticed at least 5 or 6 others did. I stayed throughout the entire film, *listening* to a movie I paid $12 to *see*, occasionally sneaking a peak, to see what was going on.I understand the quality of filming this way - it makes the audience feel like they're *there* and it's becoming a common trait in many new movies. But for an action movie,  it's asking a little too much of your motion sensory in my opinion.As for the story, itself:The movie wasn't quite what I was expecting, and that's a good thing. I thought it was just going to be another war movie, but it was so much more. Had a little bit of Jarhead, Platoon and Blown Away tastefully &  intelligently woven into its fabric. Had quite a few laughs, as well.+1 for the Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce and David Morse *cameos*. Honestly, these guys can bring respectability to any film, though it was nice that their screen time was limited. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty drove this film and deserve every ounce of the accolades it will receive.+1 For the movie not trying to spur any political debates. I felt that this movie steered clear of the good guy and bad guy designations.+1 For military EOD units finally getting some recognition.",N/A

48478,"Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (1958) is about a San Francisco detective, John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) who has acrophobia (vertigo). He is hired as a private detective, after having retired from police work, by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), in order to follow his delusional wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak). Though after a time, it is Scottie who is apparently losing his mind. There is a haunting scene at Muir Woods National Monument, among the coastal redwoods, where Madelaine has slipped away from Scottie. The forest acts here like a metaphor for his decent into a labyrinth of confusion.When Madeleine gets ahead of him at the Mission at San Juan Bautista he realizes his mistake, and chases her up the tower, but he is too late to help as his vertigo prevents him from catching up to her, and he sees her fall from the roof top. Scottie's guilt pesters him from this point on, and he begins to see Madeleine whenever he sees a blond. This is Scottie's hell on earth as his obsession takes over and he circles back to the same moment, again and again. He seems to be losing his mind, and is eventually confined temporarily to a sanitarium. Once Scottie is out of the sanitarium he eventually finds a girl who looks a lot like Madeleine. We wonder if he has lost his mind, and is only seeing what he wants to see.The vertigo that Scottie experiences, which is repeated in various circular motifs throughout the film, from spiral stairways, to the circular form of Madeleine's hair style, seems to be pointing Scottie down a vortex of confusion, as his life gets ever more lost in a madness that he can't seem to control. Hitchcock employs many ingenious devices to convey Scottie's plunge into insanity, from dream sequences, to scenes that spiral about him. In one brilliant scene Scottie and Judy are embracing in a room that spirals about them to reveal them now in a horse stall, and then again in the room, with the background turning to a brilliant, hypnotic blue. It is scenes like this, and the hypnotic pacing, as the film progressively speeds up, that reveal this movie to be the masterpiece that it is. In the last half of the movie we see why Hitchcock is the master of suspense. The film builds to a feverish pitch as Scottie's passion, and obsession, seem to be overriding his reason.As a footnote, this film has been remastered. The original film was badly faded, and has been greatly improved through modern techniques. In October 1996, the restored ""Vertigo"" premiered for the first time in DTS, and 70mm, which is a format similar in frame size to the VistaVision system that the film was originally shot in. The one caveat though is that Foley's sound effects were totally re-recorded. Harris and Katz sometimes also added extra sounds, and it is said that the new mix puts too much emphasis on the film score by Bernard Hermann over the sound effects. For one wanting to hear the original mono track it is available as an option in the 2005 Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection DVD set.",N/A
19776,"""Flatliners"" is excellent gothic horror from director Joe Schumacher (""The Lost Boys"").  The set pieces are gorgeous (especially at the college campus) and I can't help but wonder if Schumacher was influenced by Mario Bava, Dario Argento, Sergio Martino and other Italian directors of suspense and mystery.Five future super stars lead the stellar cast.  They include Kiefer Sutherland (""The Lost Boys""), Julia Roberts (""Mary Reilley"") and Kevin Bacon (""Friday the 13th"").  Sutherland convinces his fellow friends and medical students to explore the realm of life after death by experiencing a controlled cardiac arrest and flatlining.  Naturally, the results are disastrous.  Each one brings something back with them:  the physical manifestation of their sins.  The star, Sutherland, has the worst experience.  A demonic little boy in a red jacket (resembling the killer in the yellow slicker of ""Don't Look Now"" and ""Alice, Sweet Alice"") darts in and out of Sutherland's life, beating him mercilessly with fists and weapons.  These scenes, and many others, are extremely creepy, disturbing, and frightful.Despite its gloomy, gothic atmosphere of fog and mist and deterioration of warehouses and cemeteries, ""Flatliners"" leaves the viewer with hope.  Forgiveness is the key.  Asking those we have hurt for forgiveness will break us free from the nightmares of our past deeds that continue to haunt us.""Flatliners"" is highly recommended for lovers of modern gothic horror.  It is for anyone who has ever pondered what lies beyond death's door.  Sony has done a superb job of restoring this film to its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1; audio and video are excellent.  It is presented with English subtitles.

1184993,"Now, on to watching the incremental progression of the installer module program update bar. At least, those two activities portend a pay-off.  You know your discretionary time has been squandered when the most interesting scene in a movie is a 10 minute segment of competitive dishwasher loading.  Since that interlude was culled from the personal life of the screenwriter (Jenny Lumet) one has to speculate on how far the supposedly creative community has sunk.What we have here is dysfunction melded with stultification, the former exemplified by every member -past, present and potential  - of this Stamford, Connecticut clan: the reluctantly indulgent titular Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt), Kym (Anne Hathaway) the chemically dependent rehab patient sister on a weekend pass, Paul (Bill Irwin) the enabler father, Abby (Debra Winger) the emotionally distant ex-wife and mother, and let's not overlook Carol (Anna Deveare Smith) stepmom and consummate peripheral observer. If that wasn't enough, throw in the groom Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe), who had all the acting range of a guy who knows where the casting director's skeletons are buried and your journey down the highway to personal regret is in fifth gear.The film seemed like an andro inflated homage to multiculturalism. If the director or screenwriter had thought of including a scene or two at the Mohegan Casino, no one would have been left out. But, that may have been interesting and in total contrast to the stupefying pall that permeated the film. Jonathan Demme decided to film with a hand-held camera to give it a video journal feel and he succeeded. If you have ever been held hostage obligated to politely watch a friend's home videos, the scenes of the rehearsal dinner might drive you into flashback epileptic seizures.Why two stars you say? Because the actors were generally competent with the drivel they had to work with.",N/A
164425,"In 1996, with a plethora of teen horror movies coming out to theaters, one supernatural film that stood out was ""The Craft"".The film was directed by Andrew Fleming (""Grosse Pointe"", ""Paranormal Girl"", ""Dick"") and featured a story written by Peter Filardi (""Flatliners"", ""Salem's Lot"").  Joining the two are composer Grame Revell (""Pineapple Express"", ""The Ruins"", ""The Condemned"", ""Eleventh Hour"") and cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski (""The In-Laws"", ""Nancy Drew"" and ""Madea Goes to Jail"").VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Craft"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  For a film that was released in 1996, ""The Craft"" actually looks good for being nearly 13-years-old.  The film is not exactly vibrant nor do you see tons of detail but the film does manage to retain the film's grain and blacks are nice and deep.  If anything, outdoor scenes manages to look nice, colorful and bright but for the most part, it's a good transfer but nothing that would be scene as reference or spectacular.As for audio, this is where things get interesting.  ""The Craft"" is one of the few Blu-ray releases in 2009 from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment to utilize an a 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless track instead of DolbyTrue HD.  The film gives a choice of English, French and Portuguese lossless tracks but what I was truly impressed by is how immersive the soundtrack for this film was.So far, Sony has done a good job of bringing out the audio track for 90's films this year such as ""Air Force One"" and now, the same can be said with ""The Craft"".  From lighting, to rain, ambient noises, conversations in the background and crickets, you hear it utilized quite nicely through the surround channels.The sound effects really are utilized through the surround channels.  So, the film goes beyond the front and center channel speakers for dialogue and music.  Also, you'll notice some scenes utilizing LFE quite a bit, so overall, fans of the film will truly enjoy the lossless soundtrack of ""The Craft"".Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, Koeran and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Craft"" comes with the following special features (all presented in standard definition and in English stereo/English Mono with English, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese and Thai subtitles):** Director's Commentary - Director Andrew Fleming's audio commentary about ""The Craft"".  Fleming is good at discussing certain parts of the film and how they had a technical adviser who runs a large covenant of witches, thus lending accuracy to the film.* Conjuring the Craft - (24:33) A featurette featuring the screenwriter, director and producer along with the talent talking about the film and their experiences on working about the film.  Also, how the crew hired an actual witch to help in the consulting of the film.* The Original ""Behind the Scenes of The Craft"" - (6:00) Featuring the cast and director talking about the film and their characters.  Plus clips from the film.* Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary - Deleted scenes which include: Healing Bonnie, Confrontation and Nancy performs magic.  Optional commentary of why the scenes were cut by Director Andrew Fleming.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Craft"" was a pretty solid supernatural thriller back in 1996 and even over a decade later, the film continues to be entertaining and fun.  Nor does it try to approach the supernatural or witchcraft storyline in a lame manner.For the most part, very solid performances by Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell and Rachel True.  The film was before Neve Campbell became well-known for ""Party of Five"" and Fairuza Balk before ""The Waterboy"" but the crew did a good job in selecting Fairuza Balk (who is familiar with wicka) as the main antagonist of the film.  Balk somehow has this dark look to her in the film but for the most part, she did a fantastic job portraying Nancy Downs.  It was interesting to find out through the special features that Balk was familiar with witchcraft and that the director and producers felt that she embodied the role of Nancy.  And of course, for the role of our main protagonist, Robin Tunney did a fantastic job playing the role of the protagonist Sarah Bailey.""The Craft"" definitely receives a solid picture and audio transfer.  But as mentioned in the video & audio portion, the fact that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is testing out the DTS-HD Master Audio codec with this release is quite interesting.  I am starting to prefer the DTS-HD Master Audio for lossless audio and for this film, it definitely made the film much more enjoyable as the sound effects really utilize the surround channels.  In fact, one time I thought there was a cricket in my house but it was actually from the film.Overall, ""The Craft"" was an enjoyable film featuring a solid screenplay, good choice of casting and for the most part, giving an edge to this dark teenage film. Although the film is Rated-R, the film is by no means is ""The Craft"" a slasher film nor is their nudity.  But for fans who truly enjoyed this film, ""The Craft"" definitely gets a solid HD release on Blu-ray.  Definitely worth checking out!",N/A

It also drives me crazy how she keeps switching sides during the leg exercises instead of completing the series on one side.  She has zero useful form cues.  I guess thats the difference between someone who is an expert in a particular form of exercise and someone who has superficial knowledge, apparently enough to produce an exercise video.

1271263,"How can one not have huge expectations going into INVICTUS - the story of Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) using the Rugby World Cup of 1995 as a rallying point to help unify his troubled post-apartheid country, and forming a bond with the young captain of the traditionally-named (and hated by many blacks) Springboks, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon)?  Especially when it's directed by Clint Eastwood, whose two previous collaborations with Freeman won Best Picture and Director Oscars for Clint, with Freeman winning a Best Supporting Actor prize for MILLION DOLLAR BABY.  And being a huge Clint Eastwood fan who has seen everything he's directed or starred in....well, let's just say there are few films this year that I was looking forward to more.Of course massive expectations - however impossible to avoid - are frequently going to engender disappointment, and such is the case here to some extent - though there is more to like than not overall.  Freeman is just as great as I expected him to be - no, he doesn't sound exactly like Mandela, but he gets the cadences and speech patterns down pretty well, the charm and the moments of boyish impishness, and especially the sense of a troubled, lonely inner life that he has managed through supreme will to tame and use to his advantage.  This Mandela is a man determined to unite a country almost through sheer will, a man willing to be autocratic and domineering when he feels there is no other way, and a man who knows that winning over his enemies is just as important as keeping his friends.Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar is something of a cypher, a seemingly apolitical man interested in little beyond rugby, a leader himself but one who seemingly has even less chance of pulling his team from the brink of disaster than Mandela has of pulling his country up.  What Pienaar needs is confidence and spirit - something the president has in abundance; and what Mandela needs is a rallying point that both blacks and whites can get behind; obviously, in true sports-movie manner, they find each other and clearly couldn't succeed without both putting forth every effort.It's not the sports cliches that are really the problem here; after all, this is based on a true story, South Africa really WAS a giant underdog to win the World Cup, and they really did prevail against all odds.  And it's not Freeman or Damon, or any of the other fine actors; rather it's the shorthand that Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham use to show the country coming together which lacks substance and feels in the end the most cliched.  The Pienaars have a black maid who keeps quiet through most of the film, but finally gets her moments; the president's bodyguard staff is a mix of blacks and whites who initially distrust and dislike each other, and come to grudgingly respect each other, and so on.  Meanwhile little of the changing nature of the South African people in general is seen over the 5-year timespan of the film, and little of the attitudes of Pienaar's team, the Springboks, to becoming a symbol as much as a rugby team.Still the emotional power of the story does come through, in particular through the deep inner life that Freeman's Mandela manages to convey, a wisdom that understands something about how much more important reconciliation and forward-thinking is than revenge and recriminations.  I can't take credit for this thought, but I will mention that it's interesting how this film, like so much of Eastwood's past work is in a sense focused on revenge; except that in this case, revenge is seen as unambiguously wrong by the protaganist (and by extension, we the audience) and not to be applied.  The demons are exorcised, and we get a truly positive and life-affirming ending - one of the few in the director's entire filmography.  Sure, we all know that South Africa isn't a paradise now, and still has a great many problems; but the promise of someone like Mandela is I think worth holding forth still - even if it is more than a little romantacized.  The fact that 'the whole story' is not altogether well-articulated isn't entirely Clint's fault or the other participants; this is too large a story to be told in one film, one way, and if Eastwood wasn't fully up to the task, his heart was certainly in the project, and I think what he did get right was well worth doing, and seeing.",N/A

Another interesting bit of information was how many countries this film was shot in.  Many variety of locations in order to achieve realistic results and they succeeded.  But the most difficult task for the crew was getting the OK from Jose Saramago (the original writer of the novel), a man who never gives out the rights to his films.  But in this case, because the producers didn't look like the Hollywood types, he gave them the OK.  A very awesome featurette.* Deleted Scenes - Deleted scenes with a written intro by the director.  I can understand why they were cut out.  In the film, you were lead to believe that everyone inside were people who were infected by the blindness but in the deleted scenes, a significant scene was that both those who were blind and those who came into contact with those infected were in quarantine.  Another was more ruthlessness in the rape scenes and also other scenes which I was happy to see trimmed out of the film.I enjoyed ""BLINDNESS"" and definitely was surprised after watching the special featurette of how far the director went to make sure everyone had blindness training and having to wear the special contact lenses.  It definitely made the movie much more believable and also their utilization of locations to have a world that has gone astray because everyone has gone blind.  At first, I was wondering if they were constructive sets made in the back lot and a lot of CG but they really went all out in trying to find locations where to make this film happen.""BLINDNESS"" is one of those films that incorporated an all-star cast from talent worldwide.  Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo and Danny Glover are well known names in the US.  Yoshino Kimura and Yusuke Iseya are well-known in Japan.  Alice Braga is well known in Brazil (and the US for her role in ""I Am Legend""), Gael Garcia Bernal is known for his work in Mexico and Spain (also in the US for ""Babel"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") but featuring so many talent from all over the world was a good idea.Performances from each of the cast members were well done and overall, the storyline was gripping, provocative and startling.  Of course, watching the film, you kind of think to yourself, how is it that everyone has gone blind except the doctor's wife (Julianne Moore), at first I was wondering if her being able to see would be a cure but the film doesn't go that direction.  And the direction the storyline went, I was very satisfied with.  Overall, the film shows a side of humanity that eventually gets tested and pushed to a very dark side.  Everyone become equals, there is no prejudice, there is no difference in who is rich and who is poor.  When everyone is blind, everyone can either work as a group or be alone.  Eventually by the end of ""BLINDNESS"", you see that there is hope.I enjoyed the film but watching the DVD and watching the featurette ""A Vision of Blindness"" made me enjoy this film much, much more because you see how much was put into it, how much commitment from the various crews in different countries to the final moment when you see the reaction from Jose Saramago, the writer of the novel as he watched the film with director Fernando Meirelles and his reaction at the end.""BLINDNESS"" is a film worth watching and even moreso, watching it on DVD.  Highly recommended!",Blindness

268747,"It's a rare occasion indeed when an actress has the opportunity to revisit a part she had played 15 years earlier and create another interpretation of the same character. Bette Davis, the legendary Queen of Warner Bros Studios had already placed her unique stamp on the larger than life character of Queen Elizabeth 1 of England in a lavish 1939 technicolour production titled ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" which co starred Errol Flynn as the wickedly charming Earl of Essex. Fast forward 15 years with Bette now out of her contract with Warners and moving from film to film on a freelance basis. This time the studio was 20th Century Fox who were mounting another lavish version of a portion of the life of Good Queen Bess titled appropriately enough ""The Virgin Queen"". Fox hired Bette during a real slump in her career to recreate her role as the majestic Queen this time with the focus being on her ""love affair' (highly fictionalised) with Sir Walter Raleigh which actually took place during an earlier time period than that which served as a basis for the earlier 1939 film. While ""The Virgin Queen"" certainly didn't restore Bette's sagging career to its former glory, (she would have to wait until the 1962 smash ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?"" for that to happen) it is a more than respectable effort and one of her better films of this period.As with most historical dramas the historical facts of this late Tudor period are played around with in the screenplay for ""The Virgin Queen"", however that doesn't distract from its real entertainment value. The story takes place in the 1580's as Raleigh returns from campaigning in Ireland to a great welcome and through the sponsorship of the Queen Elizabeth's favourite the Earl of Liecester (Herbert Marshall) Raleigh begins a flirtation with the fiesty Queen in an attempt to get her to provide him with ships for an exploration voyage to the New World. After being Knighted by Elizabeth Raleigh also romances and eventually secretly marries Beth Throckmorton (Joan Collins) a very attractive waiting lady to the Queen. The stormy relationship between Raleigh and the Queen comes to a head when she learns of his marriage which then sees both him and Beth imprisoned before Elizabeth finally breaks down and releases her difficult favourite allowing him to fulfill his all consuming dream of an exploration to the New World. Bette Davis of course towers over the story in her second turn as Queen Elizabeth but she has some fine players to compete with here. While Herbert Marshall is his usual stiff self as Leicester, Richard Todd as Sir Walter Raleigh, while perhaps lacking the gallant charm of Errol Flynn from Bette's first outing playing Queen Elizabeth, does very well as the dare devil adventurer who both loves and clashes with his sovereign. Joan Collins yet again proves herself a good actress too as the rival to Queen Elizabeth in their mutual love of Raleigh. Joan wrote about her experience working on ""The Virgin Queen"" in her highly entertaining autobiography ""Past Imperfect"" and she recalled how nervous she was working with the formidable Davis and also wrote about the incredible attention to detail that was put into the film's costumes by the Fox wardrobe department to make then totally accurate down to the last detail. Despite her reported on set nerves Joan has great chemistry with Bette Davis in this film and the story really comes alive in the confrontation scenes between the two women.20th Century Fox's ""Cinema Classics Collection"" has seen a number of Bette Davis films given first class presentations onto DVD and along with well known, often released classics like ""All About Eve"" there have been some new seldom seen films of Bette's like ""Phone Call From A Stranger"", and ""The Virgin Queen"" which have been given a most welcome first release onto DVD. They all will be much treasured parts of any film buff's Bette Davis Collection. ""The Virgin Queen"" has been given a beautiful restoration for this DVD and of course being a costume picture lends itself so well to the brilliant Fox colour that has never looked so vivid as in this obviously cleaned up new print. The ""Cinema Classics"" release also contains trailers, a good ""making of Documentary"" titled ""Virgin Territory: The Making of the Virgin Queen"", photo galleries and a restoration comparison. This kind of film however cries out for a good audio commentary which it sadly lacks. Of the surviving cast members Joan Collins is still active and it is a great pity she wasn't brought in to give a commentary on the film which considering her earlier comments about it in her autobiography would have been of great interest. While ""The Virgin Queen"" is always regarded as a lesser Bette Davis effort it still has great merits and my recent viewing of it highlighted much that was first rate in all departments of its production. Bette was born to play England's great Queen and despite the distortion of historical facts and personalities in parts of the screenplay she doesn't disappoint in her second turn at playing Elizabeth.  I highly recommend Fox's ""The Virgin Queen"" for all lovers of period films from Hollywood's Golden Age.",N/A
1238688,"This is realism at its best! With immigration issues more current than ever this movie addresses the growing immigration and the often sad human destinies involved - not only among the immigrants but also among the very government agencies and bodies ment to manage the situation.Having outgrown Harrison Ford movies (typecast for decades) as I left my teenage years my expectations were very moderate as I entered the theatre - did I turn out to be wrong again!Harrison Ford delivers a solid performance but the movie is so much more than him - in fact most of the other characters are delivering excellent performances - and refreshingly all are depicted in a shade of grey - rather than black and white as we have come accustomed to from Hollywood for decades. It brings back sweet memories of American Beauty in this department.... in itself something I for one have been longing for for a long time.The storyline resembles another excellent movie, Crash, in its shifting between multiple stories which in the end turn out to be intertwined and Grand Torino in its coverage of the immigration issue but with far superior acting and plot. In fact particularly the acting of the immigrants were excellent and far superior to the appauling Vietnamese actors in Grand Torino.At times a bit depressing but also heartwarming and certainly a must see movie.",Crossing Over

The heist plot itself (supposedly loosely based on ""true events"" from the 60s) is brilliant.However, I cannot give the film a higher rating because I must blame the filmmakers for including way too many cliched moments, from the incompetent security guard to an old man doing the impossible (and doing it many times) to ""making the world a better place"" message. And the 100 million pound sterling question is not that hard to figure out, if you've watched a lot of robbery films.

1275618,"Spice and Wolf is one of those rare anime properties that could only have been made possible by global cooperation. The look, the feel, the animation-style, and the mythological elements are all of Asian influence but much of this particular set's charm stems from its American dub work.  The show isn't rife with action, love, violence, or romance and yet it manages to succeed on nearly every conceivable level thanks to a perfectly developed cast of characters and a world intriguing enough to present mysteries, conspiracies, and less than honorable associations.  Before we get ahead of ourselves with what makes this piece so unique, let's get the hard facts out of the way.Coming in at a 312-minute runtime, Wolf and Spice the Complete Season One box set consists of 13 episodes spanning 2 discs. The packaging breaks it down into a swing out spindle within a standard clamshell DVD case. The show wears an appropriate if not slightly conservative TV 14 rating due to a few adult-themes, some light sexual innuendo although the nudity is completely ambiguous and a healthy dose of character-driven drama.Language options are typical sub & dub meaning both the original Japanese vocal track is present as well the choice of an English dub (either presented in Stereo) with the option of running English subtitles available with either vocal track.Extras include textless opening and ending themes and a host of Funimation anime previews on the second disc.The story, which has to be watched to be fully understood (or appreciated for that matter), goes something like this: Kraft Lawrence, a twenty-five-year-old traveling merchant who peddles various goods from town to town, encounters a pagan wolf-deity girl named Holo who, though over 600 years old, takes on the incarnated form of your run of the mill naked fifteen-year-old girl except for her telltale pointed ears and fluffy wolf tail.It turns out human farmers made a bargain with this idol several hundred years prior exchanging their devotion for bountiful wheat harvest.  Thanks to several successful farm years, humans in their arrogance have forsaken their bond with Holo.  Realizing the humans no longer honor their bargain, she desires to return to her homeland in the north, a place called Yoitsu.On the surface it appears that she has simply chosen Kraft Lawrence as a travel partner to aid her in returning home but it doesn't take long for Lawrence to discover that the young girl's divine influence comes in extremely handy in his profession of trading.The pacing is just simply superb with the perfect amount of time devoted to set up and the remainder being allotted to the unique developing relationship between the two lead characters as they scheme, scam, and outsmart their way from town to town in a stream of fantastically written trade negotiations.Adding to the richness of the show is a stylized historical setting with European influences.  The background art is clean, crisp and very nicely done.  A lesser series would probably earn even more praise in this department but the characterization of the human deity and her traveling companion are such that many breathtakingly stunning visuals go unnoticed to the prose in the foreground.  In other words, the plot is well constructed; there are few moments for simply gazing at the art.It's usually a very close call, but this is one of few cases in which the English dub may actually be superior to the original Japanese dialog track.  Not to insinuate that the original dialog isn't spectacular, the material simply lends itself favorably to the inflection and slower-flow of the English dialect.  The FUNimation vocal talent should be commended for their job in keeping the humor and wit alive, well, and natural.It should be interesting to anticipate FUNimation's next move with the property as, contrary to common misconception, the animated incarnation of Spice and Wolf (based on a light novel series written by Isuna Hasekura, with illustrations by J Ayakura) did not run two full 13-epsiode seasons in Japan.  Rather the program was broken up into a full 13-episode first season, an OVA, and a 12-episode second season.  Here's hoping FUNimation decides to import both seasons to the North American market (and while we're at it, wishes for an eventual full box set release couldn't hurt either).In all, this is a shining example of the anime medium as a tool used to portray an emotional and highly enjoyable adventure where the characters are as important as the journey itself.  Highly recommended!",N/A
1106784,"Hairspray / B000W4KT6E*Spoilers*I wasn't sure what to think going into 'Hairspray' - all I knew was that it had been hugely critically acclaimed back when it first came out, but that doesn't always mean a movie will be any good. Let me just say, though, that in this case all those fawning critics were absolutely correct.Where do you start when recommending 'Hairspray'? The singing, to start with, is absolutely divine, and the lyrics of the songs are so fun and wild it's impossible not to laugh. The acting, too, is wonderful - Pffeifer is delightful in her role as the petty, aging prom queen; Latifa is spectacular, as always; Walken plays the same persona that he always plays so well; and while I was initially put off by Travolta's performance, he finally won me over and I had to admit that at the end of the movie, his character is probably one of my favorites - it's one thing to portray a character who is coming into her own as a young woman, but it's another thing entirely to pull off a character who is trying to recapture the spirit and joi de vivre of youth, and he does it well.I was surprised to see that so much of the plot of 'Hairspray' revolved not around accepting a young woman despite her heavy size (what I had assumed the movie would be about) and instead focusing on race relations and acceptance in society in general. Indeed, at the end of the movie, we have two of the most-rare-couples-in-movies: an interracial couple (where the girl is taller than the boy, no less!) and a heavy-girl/heartthrob-boy couple. This universal message prevents the movie from being just another teen movie about loving yourself and not listening to society's demands for perfection, and instead turns it into something timeless and classic. Even better, I was pleased to see that the main character never really judges her body image negatively - she is what she is, and it doesn't really bother her. That's incredibly unusual for a movie - the usual subtext underneath all the 'acceptance' platitudes is that, ideally, you would work to get that perfect body anyway, and just 'accept' yourself in the meantime. Tracy, however, doesn't 'accept' her flaws - she actively loves herself and acknowledges that she is lovely and talented.Although I'm sure that the musical from which this movie was adapted was probably even better (live performances very often are), I definitely recommend 'Hairspary' as one of the best movies I've seen. I went into it dreading a sludgy ""love yourself"" teen movie and instead found a movie that was incredibly funny, edgy, and unforgettable.~ Ana Mardoll",N/A

882844,"in order to truly understand what is going on. ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is one of the best Korean psychological thriller/horror movies that I've watched [and believe me, I've watched many]. The story centers around sisters Soo-Mi and Su-Yeon who have been away from home for awhile [undergoing treatment for an illness]. Initially they seem happy to be home, until they meet their stepmother. It is obvious the girls do not take to their stepmom, but their dad seems ignorant of the fact. Then the creepy happenings begin...Delving further into the plot will only add to the confusion, for there are many layers to this story. Though the plot unfolds slowly, it manages to grip the viewer - and in fact, I had to watch this movie more than once in order to figure out exactly what was happening. The performances by the cast is credible, and the two girls portraying the troubled sisters are amazing. As with the actress portraying the stepmom, their vivid facial expressions provide as much clues to their emotions as the dialogue. As I watched the movie, my sympathy for them grew, but at some point, I started to question if they were characters to be sympathized with or was there a more sinister aspect to them? This is the conundrum of ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" - one is not sure of what is transpiring, right up until the end [and even then, all questions may not be answered, which is why I had to watch it again!].But, it is worth watching - it's an insightful and creepy movie, a true psychological thriller which is high on atmosphere. The house itself reminds one of a spooky haunted house-type that is rich in Gothic imagery, and almost takes a life of its own. In fact, the house is as much a character in the movie as the actors. Those who love atmospheric horror stories and psychological thrillers will find lots to appreciate and dissect in this movie.",N/A

1224896,"MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3-D**** Out of 5Release Date-, January 16th, 2009Running Time- 100-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- Todd Farmer & Zane SmithDirector- Patrick LussierStarring- Jensen Ackles, Jaime King, Kerr Smith, Kevin Tighe, Megan Boone Betsy Rue, Edi Gathegi and Tom AtkinsSo here we are with the latest in what seems the never ending run of remakes; My Bloody Valentine 3-D is of course a remake of the cult classic slasher flick My Bloody Valentine originally released in 1981. As a child I loved slasher films, but as I got older most just don't work for me as well anymore. The original MBV is one that sort of holds up for me, but it doesn't work as well with me as it once did. But I still enjoy it and I was actually looking forward to the remake. Even thought I did like the original I did see some room for improvement.For the most MBV 3-D is its own movie, while there are some scenes that are like the original like the body in the dryer gag and the basic idea MBV 3-D doesn't rehash the original it just takes the basic premise and does its own thing. My Bloody Valentine is very much a throwback to 80s slasher flicks and while My Bloody Valentine won't go down as one of the all time greats it does serve it's purpose as a entertaining slasher flick that never really tries to be more than that even though there was potential for more.The screenplay by Todd Farmer & Zane Smith is what it is; look this is a slasher flick and the script isn't that important. While you do need something decent the great thing about slasher movies is even with a weak script they can still work and this one serves its purpose, but could have been a lot more. Like the original MBV you have the love triangle aspect, but here it only seems more of a filler and only there to really make suspects out of Tom played by Jensen Ackles and Axel Palmer played by Kerr Smith. Like I said there was some potential with the script, but never reached it, but I suppose when all is said and done serves its purpose.The characters were fairly interesting and are better than your average characters that normally appear. Some add to the plot and others are simply there to pad the body count. But as a whole Farmer and Zane Smith do a fairly good job with the screenplay. Like I said there was some potential with the love triangle aspect, which like I said sort of feels like a filler, but works better than the original with I personally found a little too soap opera like. The fact Axel cheats on his wife never really adds much other than to set him up as a suspect; like I said there was potential for the script to be more than what it was, but when all was said and done Farmer and Smith get the job done.Director Patrick Lussier who also directed the surprisingly decent White Noise 2 and is best known as an editor and has worked with Wes Craven on several of his movies is a little hit or miss at times here with MBV, but overall Lussier does a solid job. While My Bloody Valentine has some decent moments of suspense, Lussier seems more interested in getting with the bloodshed, which isn't a bad thing at all. The only problem I had with some of the death scenes is some just sort of happen like the eyeball scene. The killer appears and kills the guy with no real set up, but despite that the scene does work well and even if some of the kills lack a bit of set up Lussier still makes them work. Patrick Lussier aimed to make a fun flick and he very much did that. My Bloody Valentine is simply a blast and the movie always moves forward is always a lot of fun.The acting wasn't bad, but obviously we aren't gonna get Oscar worthy performances. Kerr Smith as Axel Palmer was an interesting character, but not enough was done with him, but he was still solid. Jensen Ackles as Tom Hanniger also delivers a solid performance and Jaime King as Sarah I felt was the best of the lot. Writer Todd Farmer makes a cameo as a trucker and steals the show. The highlight though was Tom Atkins; Atkins is one of my favorite actors and it was great seeing and even better in 3-D. Atkins the coolest man on the planet plays another memorable role.The mine setting works well, but isn't as creepy as it was in the original and while Lussier manages to build some decent suspense at times like I said he just seemed more interested in the bloodshed, which again like I said isn't a bad thing at all. The original MBV was a splatter flick and that's pretty much what Lussier delivers on. While there are a lot of splatter flicks still being made at times it also almost seems rare so it's great to see a no hold barred splatter flick.The death scenes are rather gruesome, but brought down some what by the use of CGI, which looks about average and that, takes a way from some really cool deaths, but in general the death scenes are pretty cool and have a nice amount of gore. This is what a slasher film should be like; violent and gory and the makers of MBV very much deliver in that regard. Even with some CGI it's still a blast!I'd say this one is on par with the original; the original was an aright flick and the remake turns out alright as well. The only thing lacking here is the creepy feel of the original, but what it might lack there it does make up for in being a fun ride with some cool deaths and gore. I almost always favor the originals over remakes, but this is the one time where I might favor a remake. My Bloody Valentine is very much is the style of an 80s splatter flick. The casting is what you see in the typical horror flick these days, but they all did well and it's easy to overlook. But overall I'd probably has to favor the remake over the original, again it might lack the creepy feel the original had, but MBV 3-D makes up for that in pure fun.I also gotta give credit to the filmmakers for having full frontal nudity. In America these days' sex and nudity is wrong for some reason, but it's good to see Patrick Lussier not giving into the PC world. So many movies released with nudity are for what ever reason called porn and movies like Zack and Miri Make a Porno the previews simply started calling it Zack and Miri and one theater in Utah refused to show it, but yet had no problems showing the violent Saw V. So with the backlash on sex and nudity in films it's good to see a movie not shy away from it. And the full frontal nude scene isn't brief either I should add.For the most part it seems 3-D never works when released in home video, but My Bloody Valentine actually was fairy decent with the 3-D. The biggest 3-D gags mostly work well. Don't expect it to be as good as it was in cinemas, but it wasn't bad and does work for the most part. When the characters are just standing around it doesn't work all that well except a couple of scenes. But when something is thrown or aimed at the camera it looks pretty good, not great, but good. I was actually surprised at how well the 3-D worked at times. Again it's not as good as it was in cinemas and there is some double images, but for the most part I was surprised at how well the 3-D was.As for the Blu-ray itself; the picture quality on the 2-D version looks good, but I only checked out a few scenes since I watched it in 3-D, but the quality is strong, but not the best transfer. The audio is 7.1, but I wasn't too impressed with it. It wasn't bad or anything, but like the transfer the sound isn't the best Blu-ray and I watched it on a TV with extra set ups that makes all Blu-ray movies sound amazing, but I just wasn't too impressed. The features are a bit weak. We have some deleted scenes and an alternate ending an audio commentary track with director Patrick Lussier and co-writer Todd Farmer. Deep Inside My Bloody Valentine is a brief making off and was decent, but nothing special and Sex, Blood and Screams a look at the death scenes, which was also decent. The DVD and Blu-ray have the same features with the exception of BD-Live.",N/A
1059108,"It isn't difficult to summarize a film with an elderly lead; they nearly always detail a failing body and mind, ending in a sad but inevitable death. It is to the credit of director Roger Mitchell, writer Hanif Kureishi, and especially stars Peter O'Toole, Leslie Phillips, and Vanessa Redgrave, that ""Venus"" is a little treasure, embracing the ravages of age and vaguries of love, both physically and spiritually, with a nearly 'gallows' humor that is irresistable.Director Mitchell, with tongue in cheek, has described the film as ""Dirty old man falls for sluttish girl"", but the May/December relationship between newcomer Jodie Whittaker and O'Toole has a poignancy reminiscent of Burt Lancaster's unrequited pursuit of Susan Sarandon in ""Atlantic City""; she teases him, then backs away, and his longing combines the frustrations of old age with the bittersweet memories of the Lothario he once was. As O'Toole's character is a respected stage and screen actor in his waning years, it isn't difficult to imagine these moments having special meaning for him (fortunately, O'Toole is in very good health!) Eventually, the kinkiness of the pair's relationship blossoms into something sweeter and more enduring, tempered by a tragedy, and quite moving.Yes, the film does end the way you'd expect it to, but in a small way, what the pair shared together improves the lives of the people around them, and the girl can face the future with a confidence he nurtured in her. Old age and death may be a 'damned nuisance', but O'Toole reminds us that the human heart is ageless...",Venus
725245,"Violent crime got so out of control from the 1970s into the mid 1990s, people did not care  ""why"" anymore. All that attempted understanding and ""rehibilitation"" went out the window.When you deal with a Manson or a Bin Ladin or just your garden veriaty sexual perditor, there is a lot of merit in this. These people are evil. You can't teach them  empathy.But Sy is not evil. He is just a sad, isolated man, one of those marginalized people who are so at a loss as to how to act, no one talks, or more importantly, listens to them. It is scary  how many people there are like Sy, and how callously we dismiss them. What if someone had taken the time to be really nice to this guy?Sy has had really awful things happen to him. He idealizes a family who's photos he develops, and wants to be part of this family. He is not even crazy, just very disturbed. He is like a child, and he sees this family as his embracing fantasy--fills in the blanks with his own yearnings. He does not want to harm, steal, violate or kill. His problem is he is completely incapable of conceiving of other people as intigrated and complex, becuase he is not.Sy may not be a bad man, but does a very bad thing. He finds out the father in the family is having an affair, and terrorizes the couple.\It is a good thing that Sy is caught: he is now off the street, where he can't escelate and really harm another.One Hour Photo is unique among films of our era in that it makes you feel geniune pity for the perportrator. The movie does not excuse what he did, and again, we want guys like Sy in a place seperate from the rest of us--he did the crime and needs to deal with the consequences.But Sy is also a product of consequences. No one talked to this man, threw him a rope, saw that he was going deep under and tried to do something. Had someone put an arm around him, took him for a coffee, would he have listened? I don't know, One Hour Photo shows how some people, left alone, can go from being strange to very, very sick--because no one payed attention when there was still time.That is the real creepiness of One Hour Photo.",N/A

1112953,"Just for kicks, THEY make noises in the night; they surround, they torment, they threaten, they hurt.  ""Them"" tells the apparently true story of a seemingly banal evil that terrorized locals in a rural area outside of Bucharest, Romania.  Rather than gore and exploitation, the filmmakers make inventive use of their camera and lighting and shadows and sound to create a serious atmosphere of dread.  It works, and gave me the same chills I had watchingThe Blair Witch Projectfor the first time: a sense of something ominous and intelligent and evil, that was somehow real and existed in the same plane as the documentary-style footage, that could be either human or something more.  Yes, I was definitely creeped out.I'd heard about this when it first played at festivals, and meant to see it ever since.  I like to keep up on foreign films, both arthouse and genre.  Still, I had the bad taste in my mouth after watching this one that comes when I see ""true crime"" specials about sadistic criminals on television.  Yes there is evil out there, and it is for the most part only a step away from ""normal.""  Still, in retrospect I wish I had the couple of hours I spent watching this back to spend on something that I could build on.  Or, rather, I wish I'd been able to walk away from this one with something valuable; not a ""moral"" since there's nothing more tedious than a film that tries to teach a lesson, but some new insight.  While the filmmakers tastefully avoid gratuitous violence or nudity, this is still not so far off from the nihilism of the so-called ""torture porn"" of films likeSawandHostel, which I've seen enough of (including those two) to decide it really is not my kind of thing.  Tied to that is that the main characters in the film are developed only slightly, not enough for me really to gain an appreciation of who they were or what their connection was.  Yes they could have been anyone, and that's part of the point, but they weren't just anyone and to watch a story like this with sufficient interest I have to know enough about the characters to care, and I didn't really get that in this case.  The female lead, Clementine, is a French teacher in Romania, frustrated by the rudeness of her pupils, and seemed much more active than her lover, Lucas.  When things start to happen he takes the lead, but only reluctantly, as if he knows that's what a man's supposed to do and does it.  The motives of ""them"" are meant to be inscrutable, and I understand that, but it leaves things pretty empty and hollow and unresolved.  That's not to discount the accomplishment of the filmmakers; they set out to tell a story that would scare the pants off of me and they came pretty close, and are obviously talented.  If you're in that kind of mood, and if you like this kind of thing, you're likely to appreciate ""Them.""  It's not for me.",N/A

When I heard there was a movie coming out based on the play, I was really excited. However, when I was watching it, I thought, ""What have they done?!"" The first thing to point out is that every one is a terrible singer. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson are too weak and they're the romantic leads. Gerard Butler (he was great in 300 but...) has no business playing the Phantom. I understand that he was trying to add a new rock-style to the role and I appreciate that but for the Phantom it just doesn't work. He basically screams the notes instead of singing them and when he doesn't scream he just swallows the notes so it sounds artificial and not beautiful. Second, the lip-syncing was beyond saving. During ""Think of Me"" Christine sings kinda pretty but her lips are barely moving and just stands there like a lifeless mannequin. Gerard Butler just over enunciates everything so it looks pretty ridiculous. Third, the direction by Joel Schumacher (the guy behind the atrocious Batman & Robin) is lazy. He's so concerned with the fabulous art direction and cinematography that he forgets about the story and characters. The whole movie is just so dull that the sense of excitement and romance in the play are lost in the transition to the silver screen. Overall, I can't recommend this as decent entertainment although I know I stand against the masses. Skip this one. Watch the musical instead.",N/A

1130048,"In HEADLESS HORSEMAN, director Anthony Ferrante takes considerable liberties with the classic short story by Washington Irving by cloaking it in a grabbag of Revolutionary War Gothicism mixed liberally with the Slasher Teen genre of countless Freddie and Jason retreads. Here, Ferrante places seven teens in a car.  These teens include the usual dopy kids, geeks, drama queens, and jock heads. En route to a party, they take a short cut and wind up in an out of the way secluded town called Wormwood, a title which bears no resemblance to the famous line from HAMLET. They learn that more than two centuries ago, a psycho killer liked to lop off the heads of his victims and he continued to do so until the towns people chopped his off in revenge.  But wait! Just as true evil never dies, the killer returned every seven years (minus his head) to seek new victims to decapitate.  He would ride a black horse and swing various lethal edged weapons to collect his heads.  By the time the teens learn all this they find out that their noggins are the true prize.HEADLLESS HORSEMAN manages to mix some pretty macabre humor with some gross out scenes of head slicing gore.  Richard Moll is the movie's only known actor as he plays a mean-spirited country bumpkin store owner who knows only too well what lies in store for the teens. One of the female leads plays a resident who surprisingly enough sympathizes with these stranded youngsters and spends most of the time walking around in a fetching short shorts and revealing blouse that make her seem like a reincarnated Elly May Clampett from the BEVERLY HILLBILLIES. The Horseman himself does far more than merely ride on his steed.  He is as equally at home on a motorcycle as he is on his feet.  He is, not unsurprisingly enough, immune to the many rifle bullets that come his way.  There is an unexpected poke at the stereotype of inbreeding in secluded mountain family groups. Richard Moll, in explaining that the current generation of genetically defective residents all of whom are the direct descendents of the Horseman, notes that he and his clan are merely engaged in ""repopulating the town.""  What emerges by the last reel of HEADLESS HORSEMAN is the unsettling notion that ancient evil and modern grim humor sometimes have to co-exist in a manner that does no favor for either victim or predator.",Headless Horseman

329530,"This is one of Von Trier's most unseen films.  It was initially released as Zentropa (the name of Lars's production company) to avoid confusion with Europa, Europa.  When it was released on home video initially, it was a pan and scan print that did no justice to the film.  Now, Criterion has put it out in a stunning, 2.35:1 DVD, so is it a good film?There is much to like in Europa.  The cinematography and the mise-en-scene is beautiful.  Von Trier's early work (this film and The Element of Crime, his debut) show a great eye for composition and framing that was abandoned in his later work for a hand held, jump cut style.  He also uses long takes in this film quite well, and the film has one of the more unique looks in his filmography.  It is mostly shot in black and white with splashes of color.  There are a lot of back screen projections that give the film a real sense of nightmare, and it works quite well.There are some very funny moments, especially with Ernst-Hugo J&auml;regrd as the uncle who gets his American nephew, Jean-Marc Barr, a job working in Germany after WWII.  He gives the best performance in the film.  Jean-Marc Barr's performance is good, but his character is rather one note.  Barr's character is so simplistically written he might as well have had ""idealist"" tattooed to his forehead.  In fact, the script of Europa is the weakest thing about the film.  You can marvel at the look of the film (and it does look fantastic), but ultimately, it's not an insightful look at post-war Germany.  Most of the dialogue is expository, and most of the characters feel like caricatures, not real people.  In fact, aside from Ernst-Hugo J&auml;regrd's character (which is very funny), the whole cast (with former Fassbinder regulars Barbara Sukowa & Udo Kier, and Godard and Fassbinder regular Eddie Constantine) slog their way through their one note characterisations.  They're such good actors that they're worth watching, but I wish they had more to do.While they are some amazing shots in this film, it's a rather hollow film.

Nixon is trying to spin, to leave a legacy idea of himself, and Frost is trying for a scoop.  The most interesting background that I did not know was how the TV industry worked and the risks that Frost took on.  There is also the conflict between Frost and the ""professional intellectuals"" he has hired to help him.I admit that I did not find Nixon's sudden confession of responsibility as all that comprehensible.  Sure, he was surprised, but something came out in the real interviews that made him appear more human.

1276305,"You have to give the Blackadder family credit -- they're tenacious. ""Black Adder - The Complete Collector's Set"" chronicles this odd, sardonic family's presence throughout the greatest eras of British history. The first season stumbles somewhat, but the following seasons are brilliant -- sardonic, kooky, and sometimes rather sick.On the day of the Battle of Bosworth Field, the Duke of York (Brian Blessed) and his son Harry (Robert East) accompanied the king (Peter Cook) into battle. His second son Edmund (Atkinson) hopes to come along, but he oversleeps -- and when he arrives, he accidentally kills the king, and Edmund's his father is made king. He dubs himself the ""Black Adder"" and decides to one day become king of England... too bad nobody likes him.He's followed by a string of descendents through the ages -- all more acid-tongued and intelligent than he, or anyone else around them. And they're always accompanied by a Baldrick. That includes Lord Edmund Blackadder, the favorite of the demented queen Bess (Miranda Richardson); Edmund Blackadder Esq., valet and butler to the half-witted Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie); and Captain Blackadder, a soldier in World War I who spends his time trying to get out of it.These unlucky Blackadders find themselves dealing with demented Puritans, hosting bawdy drinking parties, crazed bishops, even crazier princes, giant turnips, the Red Baron, drag musical acts, Spaniard inquisitors, and almost being shot for eating a carrier pigeon. Startlingly, the final season -- although another is in the planning stages -- ends on a very poignant note.But there is an upbeat ending overall -- the final episode introduces us to the modern-day Blackadder, a sharp-tongued aristocrat dining with the modern-day descendents of Prince George, Queen Elizabeth, Melchett and Darling. Not to mention Baldrick in a truly horrifying porno apron.Blackadder reveals that using da Vinci's plans, Baldrick has constructed a time machine, and bets 30,000 that he can bring back historical items. It's actually an elaborate scam... until the machine works, and Baldrick and Blackadder find themselves spinning helplessly through time, with no idea how to get home. And in a couple of side-stories, Ebenezer Blackadder discovers how his pleasant cheery attitude will affect his descendents; and the last two Loyalists to King Charles (in other words, Baldrick and Blackadder) deal with the impending execution of the king ( ""No, it's not! It's a huge pumpkin with a pathetic moustache drawn on it!"").The series starts off a little weakly -- the first season is funny, but not outrageously so, and Prince Edmund is the incompetant twerp rather than Baldrick or Percy. But things blossom with the arrival of a new writer in ""Blackadder II,"" and sets the tone for the rest of the series: a smart, bitter man who's constantly surrounded by nincompoops.There are one or two dud episodes, but the majority of them shine with comic genius, from the kookily childish Queen Elizabeth (""Who's Queen?"") to Baldrick's rancid boxers killing the dinosaurs. Atkinson gets most of the good lines (""He's the most over-rated human being since Judas Iscariot won the AD31 Best Disciple Competition"") but the rest of the cast usually gets in some great ones too (""A total pig-headed unwillingness to look facts in the face will see us through!"").Atkinson, of course, rules the whole series a series of acid-tongued Blackadders who have influence but no power, and Robinson is great as the gross servant who always has a cunning plan. The rest of the cast reappears regularly -- Laurie as a series of half-witted bluebloods, Richardson as drippy young women, Fry as cunning advisors and hearty generals, and McInnery as airbrained idiots and prissy assistants.Aside from being polished up in the remastering process, apparently this edition is going to have deleted scenes, audio commentaries (YAY!) and interviews. It's probably not worth the shell-out if you already own the whole thing, but definitely is if you don't.The complete series of ""Black Adder"" is a comic cornucopia -- it starts off a bit weakly, but once it gets its footing, it's absolute hilarious.

728776,"Countess From Hong Kong(1967) is Charlie Chaplin's final directorial feature and a rather sad swan song to such a magnificent career. The film is an outdated romantic farce about how a son of a succesful tycoon(Marlon Brando) finds a beautiful stowaway in the form of Sophia Loren, who he met in China and now finds aboard a ship with him. A romance develops, though you won't believe it. Obviously, both actors are excellent but are VERY miscast and add to the discomfort of viewing the picture as a whole.Brando cannot seem to capture the nuances of romantic/screwball comedy and is totally out of league in a role clearly intended for a Cary Grant, David Niven or even a Rock Hudson. His character comes across as cold and unfunny throughout and never gains audience sympathy.Loren looks gorgeous, like usual,but seems out of place in the role of the naive Countess. She does have a nice scene in a sarong, but that's about all that could be reccomended from her in this picture.Charlie makes a cameo appearance as a steward, but it is too little and not enough.

The campy choreography and ""Abba"" styled awful pop music, the inane script, the crude humor, the casting (undewear model, Heidi Klum as a horny giant?!?), and a hip-hop fairy godmother, all add up to a disastrous movie experience.

1246524,"The World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) returns with another action-packed film starring one of their more popular wrestlers, John Cena.The film is directed by Renny Harlin (""Cliffhanger"", ""Deep Blue Sea"", ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" and ""Cleaner""), a screenplay by Daniel Kunka, music composed by Trevor Rabin (""Race to Witch Mountain"", ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" and ""Get Smart"") and cinematography by David Boyd (Director of Photography for television series ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Without A Trace"" and ""Firefly"").The film would star John Cena (""The Marine"") as Det. Danny Fisher; Aidan Gillen (""The Wire"", ""Shanghai Knights"" and ""Blackout"") as the main antagonist Miles Jackson, Ashley Scott (""Walking Tall"", ""Into the Blue"" and ""The Kingdom"") as Danny's girlfriend, Molly Porter; Steve Harris (""Quarantine"", ""Minority Report"" and ""The Practice"") as Special Agent George Aiken; Brian White (""The Shield"") as Danny's partner Det.

The Blu-ray release includes a second disc which is a digital copy of the film.VIDEO & AUDIO:I have to say that Twentieth Century Fox has been doing an excellent job with many of their new releases on Blu-ray.  ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ration of 2:35:1), AVC@26MBPS and delivers amazing picture quality.  The detail of the film, may it be night or day time scenes are just fantastic.The film is just filled with action sequences, explosions and every detail from the explosions to the skin pores on the face of John Cena can be seen clearly via High Definition.  The colors are vibrant and overall, flesh tones and blacks are solid.  You can see the detail throughout the film and overall, ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" delivers in picture quality.As for audio, the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack is amazing.  For an action film that is going to have tons of explosions, automobile crashes and such, I expected nothing less than spectacular.  I literally felt the audio coming from all around and great use of directional panning of rear surrounds, the musical score from Trevor Rabin shining through the front speakers, audio coming clearly through the center channel and LFE utilizing the booms of the explosions and utilizing your subwoofer.  Again, ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" delivers in the audio department.As for subtitles, the film is presented in Spanish, Cantonese, Korean, Mandarin and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary by Director Renny Harlin - The more technical commentary as Director Renny Harlin sets up a scene and talks about the shots he wanted to get.

Hilarious viral videos featuring John Cena and his hand double and another with Cena's PA.* BD live bootstrap - The film is BD Live enabled.And also included is a second disc that contains a digital copy of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:I have to admit that I was impressed by the level of action in this film.  Typically, I expect action from a WWE-related film and often at times, the films have been more action than storyline based and performance by the WEE talent tends to be average or less than average.""12 Rounds"" is a film with mindless action and John Cena shows that he can be just as big of an action star as former WWE star, Dwayne (formerly ""The Rock) Johnson.For the most part, the film was enjoyable because there is so much action and there is a coherent storyline involved. The game of ""12 rounds"" between the protagonist Det. Danny Fisher and the terrorist Miles Jackson was quite interesting, especially learning the true reason of why the ""12 rounds"" was being played at the end.I did feel it was quite a stretch when we see the character Molly Porter (Ashley Scott) piloting a helicopter and I definitely didn't see that one coming.  And acting performances from the other talents were average at best.  But it's already a given, WWE-related films are not films to watch for Academy Award level performances, it's about the action and what the WWE superstar can deliver.And seeing so many bad action films starring WWE superstars, ""12 Rounds"" is definitely one of those rare gems that I felt delivered in terms of action and enjoyability.I really was entertained and it helps that Twentieth Century Fox delivered with its High Definition transfer and showcased awesome picture and audio quality because it definitely made this film much more enjoyable.  If you are going to have that many explosions and automobile destruction, I want to hear that lossless soundtrack to be magnificent.  And I'm confident to say that WWE fans and fans of mindless action-based films will truly enjoy the HD transfer of ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"".Overall, if you are looking for an enjoyable action film this Summer on Blu-ray, ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" is definitely worth checking out!",12 Rounds: Extreme Cut

1223946,"I'm not sure why Roger Ebert gave the first **1/2 but this movie * when I think it was a lot better. It has more humor and it's more engaging romance wise. The movie is a little long and slow, yet I think it still had a lot more action than the first. I don't know why the Edward and James fight won best fight at the MTV Movie Awards. It was short and not memorable. There's more excitement in this film.Plus, sorry but I just like that there's less Edward Cullem (Robert Pattinson) in New Moon. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) are more fun together in both the book and the movies. I mean, I find it repetitive in the books and the movie when Bella wants to kiss Edward longer and he constantly backs away not wanting to hurt her. There's more laughs and charm in the movie in the Bella and Jacob scenes, minus Edward.I also found the direction to be better this time around. The first movie had too much scenes with vampires walking in slow motion or close-ups of Edward and Bella as they just stare at each other. This one feels a lot less like it's just some sexy Levis Commercial lol. The script to me is better as well since I felt the first should have had more vampire history when it came to the other Cullens, especially Alice. Here, the script is at least true to the book and everything about Jake is covered nicely.I think critics need to lighten up towards Twilight a little. Sure I was annoyed how fans made sure Twilight won every award at the MTV movie Awards. I don't think it was the best movie of 2008 or even close. But I do think the movies are much better than critics have said at least. However, I do think Twilight fans overrate it tremendously as well. I am less annoyed by 5 star ratings by fans for New Moon than I was with the first film though. Since I think this movie has a lot more going for it.",N/A
208887,"So I originally posted this review with 3 stars, going into great detail and complaining about how incompetent a villain Khan was.  And then it took some time and thinking to realize the film isn't about Khan---it's about revelation and realization, that terrible sensation that is a common trope in any adventure series featuring close friends: the moment where one realizes that they are not invincible.Admiral Kirk has gone through the vast majority of his career smoothly, a stalwart hero as likely to resolve a conflict with words as with fists, and always able to rely on his trusty friends.And he's bored.  He's old, he's bored, and he can't stand it.His career-long invincibility was actually a crutch to him, as he had glided through for so long, always having an escape plan or a secret option to escape from defeat.  The Kobayashi Maru ""no-win scenario"" running plot-MacGuffin is in no way a Red Herring---it comes back around and smashes Kirk in the face when he realizes his refusal to accept a no-win scenario worked for him in the past, but it will never truly work out in the end.Spock dies.  That's not a spoiler; it's a forgone conclusion.  Spock's death isn't just a tacked-on ""SHOCKING SWERVE~!"" thing I had originally called it in my review.  Spock's death was in no way something to justify Khan being considered such a fiendish villain.Spock's death was that moment, that revelation.  It was the moment Kirk realized there IS no cunning solution to the Kobayashi Maru.  It was the moment Kirk realized he is NOT invincible.  Indeed, Khan (at least until movie three) did exactly what he wanted to do to Kirk---he hurt him.  And he made sure Kirk would go on hurting, for a long while.Kirk himself states at the end that he ""feels young"".  In fact, he does.  Having lost his best and closest friend, he is suddenly shown that he is not immortal, and he cannot loll through missions and commands expecting everything to work out in the end because it's ""Star Trek"".  He has cheated death all his life through all his missions, and death finally strikes him, not where it could do the most damage, but where it could HURT him most significantly.Khan is still a lackluster villain to me.  Ricardo Montalban is magic with his acting talent, and brings an epic, operatic quality to Khan Noonien Singh.  But that's about it.  There's a huge multitude of parallels with Khan, the character and the movie, involving ""Moby Dick"" and ""Hamlet"" and ""King Lear"", and spectacularly executed with Khan's mirroring of Captain Ahab, blindly chasing his quarry, to the death and destruction of himself.Above all, it's worth mentioning this is NOT an action movie.  It's an insult to this movie and it's dramatic, operatic quality to call it as such, especially when comparing it to ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"".  It's a common barb of fans of The Motion Picture to claim people like Wrath of Khan more because it's more action-packed.No, it's not.  People like Wrath of Khan more because of the STORY and the depth and skill by which it is told, with deep themes on weighty issues such as death, aging, rebirth, and revenge, that resonate through all time, and are handled in a highly complex manner which most people would completely miss from their first viewing of the film, likely due to the stigma of ""geekiness"" and ""goofy garbage"" that Star Trek has.""The Motion Picture"" was an adaptation of a failed TV series pilot featuring the original crew.  It involved a 30 minute story dragged out to nearly 2 hours, with blatant padding all around, from a FOUR MINUTE UNCUT sequence of just Kirk and Scott looking at the Enterprise while SLOWLY flying around it in a transport pod, to EVEN MORE SEQUENCES EVEN LONGER of the crew just staring into V'Ger's cloud, and arbitrarily cutting back to people's faces as they stare out the window.  ""2001"" Star Gate sequence this ain't.The Motion Picture was full of long periods of nothing, and a very powerful theme of obsession---that of Kirk with command of the Enterprise---that was childishly ""resolved"" not by any character development or revelation, but by having the one person opposing his command (Decker) conveniently exit the picture without really dying, but more or less dying.Wrath of Khan does not avoid any weighty issues or themes.  There is no quickfix solution to anything.  Kirk can't just have Khan's ship explode, then shield the Enterprise in some kind of Nebular vacuum spot where he can survive the Genesis explosion.  Kirk can't just blast Khan out of the sky and fly home victorious.In some way, Kirk has earned redemption in this film for all the swaggering and slickness of his days of youth in The Original Series.  He is hurting, and he will go on hurting...At least until Star Trek III: Search for Spock.",Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan VHS

The story is marriage of convenience in plot but that is about all that is borrowed in this fresh and captivating story.

1276961,"I didn't expect much going in to see this remake of a 1974 film and I left the theater feeling pretty much how I felt before I bought my ticket. A story which was quite unique 35 years ago is no longer anything special and the performances were all over the map. Denzel Washington gained 40 or so pounds for the part and was quite believable playing this low key character, but John Travolta played this villain like the wild one in Face Off. It worked in that other film, because just about every scene was so over the top, but everything here is based in reality so it came across as almost cartoonish at times. Don't get me wrong, he seemed to be having a great time playing the character and he did have a few good lines, but we have already seen this character done better in that John Woo movie back in 1997. John Turturro and James Gandolfini both did well with much smaller roles.The ending also missed the mark. In fact, the last 30 minutes or so brought the film down from it's flawed, yet entertaining level. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 screams DVD rental and nothing more.

568401,"I liked Broken Hearts Club from the first preview session in a local (Brisbane) boutique cinema. I've thoroughly enjoyed it several times since on DVD - including last night. The only flaw that gets to me is in the opening scene where the gay friends are playing at acting straight and Zach Braff loses by using the term ""girlfriend"" - and Tim Olyphant's character adds one too many negatives to his response, saying ""There isn't a straight man in America who doesn't call anyone but their girlfriend ""girlfriend""."" He should have said ""There isn't a straight man in America who calls anyone but their girlfriend ""girlfriend""."" A minor point perhaps, but double negatives give me a right royal headache.It still gets five stars, because the other flaws are even more trifling. There are some excellent memorable lines - and Dean Cain (one of the most attractive, and contentedly straight, men in the world) utterly convinces in his role as gay bimbo Cole and seems to be having the time of his life.I have a similar group of long term friends, in whom our only common factor is that we're gay - and that's why we met in the first place.

The monster's CGI was too terrible for it to even be scary. The ending also wasn't very good and left too many unanswered questions.

1294210,"If this was the movie James Cameron has wanted to do since he was a teen, then maybe he should have taken better notes, or should have taken a very sharp editor's eye to his script.Because while this film is indeed pretty and a spellbinding achievement in the most stunningly realistic CG of any movie today, the plot is almost insulting in how stale, cliche'd, and just plain boring, ordinary, and generic it is.  There's no surprises to be had; you know exactly who's going to win and who's going to lose, you know exactly how different action (not just fight) sequences will turn out, you know exactly what characters will live and which will die, which ones will have an abrupt Heel-Face turn, and which ones will turn out to be good all along.I can't really tell just why such a film like this comes out so cheesey and cliche' in terms of its plot, whereas a film like Star Wars, in its trilogy, contains a great many classical and common elements of folk tale and mythology and literature, and yet manages to be a stellar and timeless story.This story in ""Avatar"" is anything but.  The only thing that will be memorable of this movie is its visual effects.Right from the start, the film does wonders with visual effects, showing us a highly realistic-looking sleeper ship, and a zero-g environment on board, that neither looks overly cartoony or overly CG'd.  It looks perfectly real all around.Every effect just screams ""real real real!"", from the computer monitors and holographic displays, to the plants and vegetation and variety of animals.  Cameron does not overindulge us by making us look at everything in detail, showing off, but neither does he rush through intricate details in an attempt to stay grounded to the script.  It's a perfect mix of showing us nifty new creatures and inventions without stalling long enough to make us think he's showing off.The Na'vi start off looking quite real, but very blatantly CG.  There's a very slight sense of artificiality in the Avatars when they are first on screen, and shown awakening and interacting with humans.  But as the movie progresses, the effects seem to get better and better, to a point where towards the end, when Na'vi and Humans interact closely, both of them look incredibly REAL, as though the Na'vi were a huge puppet creation, and yet it's entirely CG.Where they went all-out with the visuals, they completely lost it with the story.  It becomes less ""Avatar"" and more ""Dances With Wolves In Space"" or virtually any Generic Action/Adventure Film In Space.  The parallels with Dances With Wolves are the most powerful, likely due to the commonplace aspect of it.But the story doesn't treat this as some sort of surprise.  Nor does it even try to be distinct in some way.  You know exactly how characters are going to react to situations.  You know exactly what's going to happen next.  You know that the Generic Nerd Sidekick appears jealous and resentful of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) now, but you know later on he's going to become the HERO who tries to save him.  You know that Sully is going to be initially hated by Action Girl Love Interest (Zoe Saldana), but eventually get her to love him, You know that Bad Ass Action Girl (Michelle Rodriguez) is going to betray the humans and side with Sully and the Na'vi.  You know that certain characters are going to die.  You know that Sully will earn the trust and respect of the tribe.  You know that Sully is going to admit he's been spying on the Na'vi, and cause Action Girl Love Interest to cry and scream and hate him and tell him to go away, You know this and that and everything.It's all so obvious that it becomes stupefyingly boring, and you wouldn't have ever noticed that fact if the movie weren't so much fun to look at.But while the effects and even much of the story was interesting enough to keep me drawn in, the most spectacular visual effect focus was on the Na'vi themselves...  and the Na'vi themselves, as a society, were a breakneck yank out of immersion, and into a silly and childish realization:""They are exact alien copies of Native Americans!""They are exact copies, from the mohawks, to the way the Elder Father and Mother characters look and dress and sound, to the high pitched yipping sound they give in battle, they are EXACT COPIES of Native Americans.It would seem to me that this element was lazily left in from the ripping off of the plot of ""Dances With Wolves"", and that would probably be a great discussion point, but like a great many modern ""PC"" portrayals of Native Americans, they sugarcoat them so much, they become just as racist as the Savage Red Man (Blue Man?) portrayed in older stories.These Na'vi Americans are so in touch with their environment, they can talk to animals by sticking tentacles in their hair into plugs coming out of the animals' heads.They can wrap these tentacles around long tendrils from the ""Tree of Souls"" to pray directly to their God.  They have to cry and chant a ritual chant every time they kill an animal.  They use bow and arrows, ride on animals, and make yipping sounds like the Natives in old ""cowboy and indian"" movies and storypieces.It wouldn't be so bad, and it never really ventures into a racist depiction (especially since most of all these are ALIENS and not Native Americans), but the parallels are too strong to ignore---this is not even a metaphor or parody or Horatian satire, these Na'vi are nearly word-for-word copies of stereotypical Native Americans, with a little bit from everywhere, such as the Caribbean-sounding Elder Mother, to the ""Great Chief Man Sitting Bull"" sounding Elder Father, to the Warrior Son with the mohawk and pithy attitude to Sully.But since these AREN'T Native Americans and they ARE aliens, James Cameron can get away with essentially portraying them as the stereotype of the ""in perfect harmony and touch with mother nature"" good guys, whereas the Humans, with the exception of only the obvious ones and the Nerdy Pacifist Scientists, are all evil, greedy, corporate-thinking scum who can't do anything with a planet except rape it and kill it slowly for resources, as though environmentalism efforts today would never ever work out or catch on.  THANKS FOR THE FAITH, CAMERON!While the story is essentially glossed over with a spiffy coat of paint to seem new-ish, there's no real need to worry about spoilers---there's nothing here we haven't seen before, and nothing here that wasn't told better and more realistically in other movies and stories.It's a stereotypical ""White Men vs Indians"" tale of the 90s, with the evil Humans being thwarted by the holy Na'vi.And yet we get the Unfortunate Implication that the Na'vi apparently could not have survived or banded together without the leadership of Jake Sully, White Man Sky Person.THANKS FOR THE SUBTLE RACISM, JAMES CAMERON!",N/A

844688,"Super Outstanding!!!! This is ""modern day"", ""mature"" Blondie performing at their best!!! This was filmed on May 7, 2004 at the John Jay Theater in New York City. It was originally filmed as a ""live"",""call-in"" request television show.  Some of the members have changed. This line-up consists of Debbie Harry on lead vocals (It wouldn't be Blondie without her), Chris Stein on guitar (a founding member), Clem Burke on drums (a founding member), then you get some new musicians - Paul Carbonara on guitar, Leigh Foxx on bass guitar, Kevin Topping on keyboards. These musicians & Debbie perform outstanding!!! It is ""hosted"" by Jules Asner, and you get a special guest request by John Waters.You get some songs from their ""new"" album ""The Curse of Blondie"", which include: ""Good Boys"", ""Undone"", ""End to End"", and ""Hello Joe"". Plus, you get their classics, and a few rarities.Well like the title says, this concert is ""live by request"", Blondie accepted telephone calls, and emails from people requesting particular songs. The basic concert (The TV Portion consists of 14 songs), and with this DVD, you get 4 more ""bonus"" songs, plus the music video of the song ""Good Boys""This is a great concert, Debbie is great, and so is Chris Stein. Chris & Debbie both, get in on some of the ""impromto"" converstions with the ""host"" and the people requesting songs via telephone. Even, Clem Burke the drummer answers one song request. The rest of the band is great also.This is a great concert DVD, and I highly recommend it for any ""Blondie"" fan, or any rock fan period. This is great ""stuff"". Thanks!!!",N/A

1138562,"Much of the negative criticism leveled at Roland Emmerich's ""10,000 BC"" is valid.  The film is derivative of other (better) films including ""The Searchers"", ""King Kong"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" and dozens more; it's chock full of anachronisms and dubious history; and the story is at times unbearably cheesy, especially when the screenplay cheats the audience by using mysticism and magic to achieve contrived emotional effects (this is particularly true of the story's hokey happy ending).And yet, despite these flaws, the film is not without its charms.  For those viewers able to suspend logic and focus simply on its visual qualities, ""10,000 BC"" offers up some splendid special effects, gorgeous art direction and set decorations, and best of all, exquisite cinematography by Ueli Steiger that truly stimulates the imagination.  I experienced the film on Blu-ray disc screened on a 60 inch 1080i monitor, and was so impressed by the lavishness of the production that I frequently forgot and forgave the vagaries of the screenplay.  This is a movie that is perfect for those nights when you want to disengage your mind, relax with a bowl of popcorn, and simply pass two hours enjoying an inconsequential spectacle that requires a minimum amount of concentration.  If you can appreciate it for what it is, and not be disappointed by what it isn't, you may very well get a kick out of ""10,000 BC"".","10,000 B.C."

1192237,"The first episode of Season 10, ""The Lost"", was astonishing and by itself worth the price of this set.  I have never seen such amazing, powerful writing and acting on the small screen.  I was absolutely blown away.""The Lost"" is incredible on so many levels-- in portraying the insanity that was taking place in Africa through the eyes of individual people, in showing the friendship between Carter and Kovacs, and simply in illuminating so many things that are true about the human spirit.  It is scary, serious, tense, and full of unexpected twists.  By the end of this episode, Carter and Kovacs feel absolutely real.  You will be deeply moved and uplifted by the choices these characters make.  How often does any of us reach the end of a television program feeling that way?  This episode was an amazing milestone for the actors, writers, and audience.  If it was a film, I think it would be an Oscar nominee.  (One note for sensitive viewers-- this is a violence-filled episode, definitely not suitable pre-teens.  Violence includes sexual assault, systematic murder, etc. ...)I do agree with another reviewer's comment that Carter's choices in the episodes after he returns from Africa are a bit frustrating-- not what we hope for.  But that's okay.  There's lots to love with the new characters, and lots of the great ER medical drama we've come to expect.Highly recommended.",N/A
6116,"Viewing this movie shortly after seeing ""Goodfellas"" and two years worth of ""The Sopranos"" may have been an error on my part.  ""Donnie Brasco"" just isn't as good.  I can't put it in simpler terms.  All of the Sopranos characters are three dimensional, and one develops a certain empathy for them, if not admiration of their values.  They laugh, live, drink, live.  The same for Goodfellas.  There is nothing even two dinensional in Brasco.  Not one of the characters ever breaks from the fake tough guy scowl.The acting isn't the problem.  The movie has a fine cast.  The flaw is in the writing.  For example, the character played by Al Pacino is a petty, small time cog in the mob, from start to finish, with one notable moment.  Brasco doesn't really change much from an FBI agent, trying to pass as a criminal.In short, I just wasn't convinced in the sense that I am convinced by Tony Soprano et al. or by the trio of comrades in arms in Goodfellas.  Perhaps I would have had a higher regard for the subject film if there were not much, much better films about the mob.  Forgettaboutit.",N/A
542457,"I'll admit that I written off Scary Movie 2 when I first seen it as a sporadically funny sequel to Scary Movie(which I love). After seeing it again it's a lot better than I gave it credit for and is better than what comes after it.Scary Movie 2 pokes fun at haunted house movies, The Exorcist and even Charlie's Angels. The movie has its fair share of laughs in the beginning of the movie but sometimes the gross out gags are way over the top. To explain why I think this movie is a mixed bag, I'll contrast the funny parts from the unfunny parts.Funny Scene#1: The beginning with the spoof on the Exorcist was pretty funny stuff.Unfunny scene#1: The scene with James Woods on the toilet is flat out disgusting. Bleeech! James Woods already gives me the creeps so the last thing I need to see is him on the john.Funny Scene:# 2: Marlon's character teaching Anna Faris's character how to be hip and she mistakenly beats up on some unsuspecting girl.Unfunny Scene# 2: Chris Elliot's abnormal hand digging into a pie as well as a turkey. Nuff said!Funny Scene# 3: Tori Spelling's character becomes clingy to a ghost after a night of sex.Unfunny Scene# 3: Shawn Wayan's character impaling the evil clown from Poltergeist with his third leg. Need I say more?Funny Scene: # 4:  The spoof on the Nike commercial.Unfunny Scene: #4: The wisecracking parrot pooping.I could go on forever.Scary Movie 2 is a lot better than most people give it credit for but it could have been a lot better than it predecessor. What kills it is the excessive gross out gags are focused on more than the movie that its supposed to poke fun at. All in all it was a good spoof not a great spoof. Its definitely better than Scary Movie 3 and 4.",Scary Movie 2

If you have been dancing for a time and tribal fusion has your curiousity, take your intermediate or advanced moves a step further with Fayzah `s  creation of Fluid tribal Style!To begin, a welcome for viewers with a brief overview of the contents of the program  which includes:A chat about essential oils and personal ritual and meditationFantastic warm up with yoga postures""Reference section"" of tribal moves and a flow section to use as practiceShort segment on zil types,rhythms with dance demonstrationsChoreography break down for Bounty KillerFayzahs interpretations of her unique tribal style choreographies to different music genres.If you are a beginner, this program may be a goal to work up to. For intermediates, the dance structure and key components of Fayzah program are ideally categorized and the menu options of the dvd present them in a user friendly fashion. Here,they are easy to navigate to using the repeat option will give the viewer the repetions of the chapters as needed. At times, I felt the instructor moved too quickly from one move to the next, so I opted to repeat each chapter automatically by setting the repeat mode on my dvd player remote.The tribal fusion foundation movement is a fantastic training, which in my opinion makes the program worth every minute and cent invested into it. Fluid and staccato arms and hand movement, percussive hip moves which are intricate and richly layered and  implemented into the ""Bounty Killer"" choreography. Although brief, the demonstrations on walking, turning, using the chest, headslides, abdominal isolating, popping, and articulating hands, training the arms, using loose hip shimmies, (just to name a few), are also included. This fabulous dancer's  versatility in movement accommodates various music genres as well including jazz. This is definitly beyond basic belly dancing!Fayzh appears delicate and soft spoken but watching her move is obvious of her muscle control. Her costumes are  not over done yet tasteful, allowing her femininity and grace to come through with less of appearing harsh, robotic and mechanical.It was easy to become totally engrossed in the foundation section. Time seemed to pass me by as I dilligently worked on the dramatic ""fierce isolations"". I didnt especially like the Bounty Killer choreography but there is much beneift from the foundation section.The ""movement play flow""  takes the viewer into  turns, walks, and combinations previously shown. ""Slow Washer Woman""  is a fabulous combination to learn. The down to earth terminology is a change from technical jargon as she defines her combinations.Fayzah presents several dance performances and it is obvious overall, the elements in dance foundation remain. The modern concept of dance integrated from belly dance basics makes this style perfect for the day. Because art changes and evolves, I am open to new styles and keep an open mind. Knowledge is a continuous journey so learning from this program and implementing the richness of fluidilty, and defining isolations enrich my personal style.When reviewing a program I usually look for three main points:Presentation, technique and end results. There are strong points in all of these. This style is attainable if you choose to invest time and patience.Video instruction is not a substitute for training with a qualified instructor.The music and settings feel familiar and Fazyzh is vivid amongst beautifull lighting effects against a clean background. If I were to find faulit, I would venture to say that personal rituals such as the  section on essential oils, meditation, feel more like ""fillers"" and are too personal.","Fluid Tribal Bellydance, with Fayzah - Swirling Waves, Fierce Isolations, Hits & Breaks: Bellly dancing classes, Tribal fusion belly dance instruction"
1186674,"It finally happened: Peyton and Lucas got married and had a baby girl named Sawyer! To be quite honest, the series ""One Tree Hill"" has lost its touch from WAY too many story lines of having characters fight back and forth over the same things again and again. Brooke (Sophia Bush) continues to fight with her mother Victoria (Daphne Zuniga)in who has control over the ""Clothes Over Bros"" store. She has a continuing relationship with Julian (Austin Nichols) and in the end, tries to make him jealous by having a fling with Nick Lachey from the 90's boy band ""98 Degrees"" and ""adopts"" the rebellious teen Sam Walker (Ashley Rickards). The basketball rebel Quentin Fields (Robbie Jones)life ends suddenly when he is an innocent bystander in a robbery. Nathan (James Lafferty) continues on his neverending quest to become a rising NBA star, (although I don't understand how you can after you shave points in a high school basketball game). Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) gets offered to have his book turned into a movie and finds it hard to cast the actors and actresses to play the people in his life. Peyton (Hilarie Burton)finds out that she might have cancer and the possible risk of it hurting her and her unborn child. Haley (Bethany Joy Galeotti) struggles in her career as a teacher and goes back to her roots as a singer/songwriter. Young Jamie (Jackson Brundage) deals with the sudden death of Quentin, the discovery of Skillz (Antawn Tanner) and his grandmother Deb (Barbara Alyn Woods)hooking up, and understanding the pains of growing up. From this season, I'm still wondering why Dan (Paul Johansson)was kept alive throughout this season even though crazy nanny Carrie (Torrey DeVitto) ran him over and attempted to make him suffer in anyway possible. Overall, this season was hugely disappointing in many levels. These ""Tree Hill"" characters may think they've grown-up but really, they're still trapped in the same high school drama. Hilarie Burton and Chad Michael Murray will not be returning for Season 7 and the producers hope to mix it up with new characters and the setting will be one year into the future.",One Tree Hill: S6 (DVD)
1193737,"I was really psyched about watching this movie. All of the positive reviews on here plus an extremely vocal Blockbuster employee really got me pumped for this British horror flick.Unfortunatly, the movie didn't really work out that well for me.I am a fan of horror films and like any normal fan of the genre, I embrace twists and turns and new ideas...but, Eden Lake, despite it's gorgeously filmed directing and cinematography, left me feeling anything but happy.Having just seen the French thriller THEM, I was not really looking forward to the child-killers angle. I feel like it's a little TOO real and disturbing for cinema. On the flipside of that though, it works because it IS such a visceral and controversial topic. No one wants to think that there children could commit such crimes, but the reality of it is that children, when left to there own devices, can come up with some pretty sick ways to have fun. Eden Lake takes that idea, throws in a gang of young teens, a perky, cute preschool teacher and her attractive fiance and an undeveloped lake property that will soon be a resort and mixes them into a torture flick that DOES entertain...but ultimately lets viewers down.*****************spoilers below***************************The gore: There wasn't a TON of gore as some might have mentioned. I have seen worse. The most effective scenes would be shots of a very realistic looking GAPING stab wound that is pouring blood. It looked very real and very nasty.The torture of the main character is bad, but I have seen worse. There is also some light animal related abuse along with a fairly violent dog death. Some people have said the death of the dog was not bad...but it was actually one of the worst dog deaths I have seen on a film and it was actually pretty sad. The dog wasn't an evil, menacing dog...it was merely the main bullies pet and had a slight barking issue...when the dog ended up stabbed it was an accident and there is some dog crying and yelping that lasts for a bit and we see a few shots of it lying on the ground breating slowly with it's eyes open as the boy yells ""she's dying!"" over and over again...which was very dramatic and upsetting to me, being an animal lover with dogs of my own. So, that said, fair warning to any people who can't watch dogs or pets killed on film. This wouldn't be a good one to see because of that scene.Overall: While I understand the familiarity of killing off every single main character, I felt robbed at the end of this film. Jenny went through so much hell, she was tortured more mentally than anyone would want to go through. Having to kill children to survive was something she had to do to fight and live...but, the ending of this film LITERALLY left me in tears. The raw emotional pull on your heart as you realize what is about to happen to her, after everything she had been through, was devestating. I actually stood up and paced in front of my tv, shaking my head in disbelief. I was highly upset. The injustice of the ending along with the survival of the ""HEAD BULLY""  (who I just wanted to get killed the whole time!!!) was enough for me to want to never see this film again as long as I live.Very upsetting, very disturbing and WAY too much of an emotional rollercoaster for my taste. I dont want to watch a horror movie that makes me want to cry and scream at my tv about injustice and things not being fair. I also don't want to come off as ignorant by playing the ""i wish it had a happy ending"" route. What horror movie TRULY has a happy ending? People have been slashed and killed, so is there really going to be a HAPPY ending? Doesn't make much sense. But, I do like a film that at least has a SURVIVOR. No survivor usually equals a waste of time to me in the long run.So, this film just didn't work for me. I never want to see it again and can only really recommend it to people who can handle truly unhappy endings.",Eden Lake

346172,"Normally I'm not much of a western fan, but I really took to ESCAPE FROM FORT BRAVO.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that the movie features one of my all-time favourite actresses, Eleanor Parker, in a lead role.ESCAPE FROM FORT BRAVO (John Sturges, 1953), stars William Holden as Captain Roper, a merciless officer at Fort Bravo, in charge of a group of captive Confederate soldiers.  The arrival of beautiful Carla Forester (Eleanor Parker) sidetracks Roper's attention long enough for Carla's boyfriend, Capt. John Marsh (John Forsythe) and three other prisoner soldiers (including William Demarest and William Campbell) to make their daring escape through the mercilous Arizona Desert...prowled by the equally unforgiving Mescalero Indians...The amazing desert scenes were filmed on location in Death Valley - and something tells me that all the sweat seen on Holden & Co. was real!  Eleanor Parker was the perfect actresss for Carla; she provides a fantastic ambiguous quality to the role, one of the things which marked her as one of the most talented--but sadly VERY underrated--stars of her generation.  I also enjoyed the comic banter between the William Campbell and William Demarest characters.The DVD from Warners features a basic, albeit unrestored print.  Some reels look muddier and dirtier than other ones; and it sadly seems to be incorrectly framed.  Colours appear fine, which is a relief considering that most of the movies filmed in the Ansco Color process haven't aged terribly well.  The only extra is a trailer.This movie is also available with another Eleanor Parker title (""Many Rivers to Cross"") in Warner's ""Western Classics"" boxset which includes ""The Law and Jake Wade"", ""Saddle the Wind"", ""The Stalking Moon"", and the 1960 remake of ""Cimarron"".",N/A

He has similar looks and is an underrated actor.

In this case, the two main ones are played by Frederick Forest (""Apocalypse Now"") and John Ashton (""Midnight Run""). Since it was made for television in the 1980s, the movie has little profanity and blood.Most of the time, the violence is implied. It's still chilling in parts. We don't always need CSI-type blood and guts to get the point.What they missed, however, was WHY Bundy did the things he did. They had time to develop that angle, but never touched it. Supposedly, violent pornography had something to do with his behavior, but nothing was explored in this film.

669763,"This is the best movie I've ever seen, starring my all time favorite actress, Sally Field. Sally won an academy award for best actress for her part in this film, which she very much deserves. She did one fantastic job of acting. So did the people who played the blind man and the black hired hand.Set in the Great Depression, it portrays people who are tender in their caring for others, very strong in their faith in God and gutsy in their refusal to quit when the going gets tough. In contrast it portrays an insensitive, greedy banker, who shortly after her husband's senseless killing encourages Edna Spalding (Sally Field) to sell her house to pay off the mortgage, go live with her sister and since she doesn't have room to house all of Edna's family, send one of her two children to live with relatives in another state. She bluntly turns down his offer, letting him know that she will find a way to get the mortgage money in on time.A black man named Mose's (Danny Grover) offer to help Edna grow cotton, while met with initial hesitation, undoubtedly influenced not only by the South's attitude toward blacks, but also by the fact that her husband was killed by a drunken black man is finally accepted. Edna is also coerced by the banker into housing his blind brother Will (John Malkovitch), which turns out to be a real blessing is disguise. Her black hired hand is also a Godsend. He proves to be worth his weight in gold and when the cotton harvest is in, the mortgage payment is more than met. The movie ends on a triumphant note, with blacks and whites setting next to each other in church, receiving communion. The Scripture text for the day is I Corinthians 13.

656173,"2008 gave us three excellent superhero films: The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk.....and Iron Man. Director Jon Favreau truly did his homework while researching Marvel Comics' high flying superhero, and it shows. I think i was one of the very few who thought it would be tragic if there were missteps to putting Iron Man to the big screen. I mean, for every Spiderman or X-Men 2, theres a Ghost Rider or original Punisher. But Favreau understood the appeal and complexities of billionaire Tony Stark, and took what was considered by some to be a second tier character and gave him three dimensional authenticity.For starters, lets not forget Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, who created Iron Man in ""Tales of Suspense # 39"" in the early 60s. Theirs is the blueprint from which this film sprang. It is soooo faithful to the origin of the character, despite modernizing certain elements, which i was totally fine with, since it made total sense: Instead of Vietnam, we see Stark captured in Afghanistan. Instead of a jungle warlord, we have members of a Taliban-type organization, yet the weapons manufacturing angle remains intact. We see Stark's interaction and subsequent friendship with fellow inventor/prisoner Yinsen, well played by Grant Toub. The moment when Stark creates and puts on his original, bulky silver suit of armor had me grinning from ear to ear, blasting his way from captivityAs he returns to America, Stark, who was a munitions manufacturer for the U.S. military, decides to change his views on weapons of war and instead use his gifts to battle those who threaten the oppressed, here as well as overseas.Robert Downey, Jr is the engine that drives this film from beginning to end, and hes brilliant. Anyone who knows the character of Stark from the comic books knows hes an at times arrogant, shallow playboy who enjoys his drink and his women. Downey has him down pat and his transformation from selfish, wealthy jerk to a slowly caring humanitarian/hero is peppered with humor and wit. The times we see him designing his suits of armor, through trial and error, mostly error, are funny, yet we see the human being in him with a newfound cause, and the moment in the film when he travels back to Afghanistan, as Iron Man, and wages war on his former captors as they terrorize innocent villagers, will make you jump up and down.Jeff Bridges, one of my favorite actors of all time, plays Obediah Stane, who runs Stark Industries with Tony and acts as father figure to our hero until we discover his true nature and motivations concerning continuing their weapons division. He's a great bad guy. Even Gwyneth Paltrow delivers fun work as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant. This is the only time i can say i enjoyed watching her on screen, and shes actually fun to watch in her playful interactions with Downey.Tight direction from Favreau, a great screenplay, excellent special effects and a fun, multi-faceted performance from the multi-talented Downey makes ""Iron Man"" one of the better superhero adaptations to come along in a while.Loved it.",N/A

990132,"Back in the 80's, I remember seeing photos of Peter Berlin. I was struck by how different he was from other performers. He went out of his way to stand out in the crowd, and he was keenly aware of how clothes (he chose the most skin-hugging/daring outfits) can actually enhance eroticism, as opposed to looking at the male form in full-on nudity.As this fascinating documentary about a fascinating man states, Berlin was the ultimate artist, using himself as his own ""canvas""...and he did so with striking effect. The face. The body. The clothes. Berlin helped define the 70's gay culture, combining faint androgony with masculinity.The film explores all the facets of his life, while simultaneously displaying tons of photo stills of Berlin: His youth in Germany; his ""awakening"" in America under the persona of Peter Berlin; the two legendary films he made; his deeply touching 20-year friendship with James; surviving the AIDS crisis; and finally, growing old. For a man in his 60's, he looks almost the same as he did decades ago. Retaining much of his boyish looks, he's in such good shape that he can still wear those same daring outfits!Chock full of interviews from others (including Berlin himself), this is an intriguing film about an iconic artist who virtually became ""the Greta Garbo of porn"".

Not very true to the comic, and Thor is portrayed as a primitive brawler, but fun.",N/A

351384,"Going into The Age of Innocence, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Martin Scorsese has been one of my favorite directors for some time now yet this is a film that I have always put off watching. To me, looking at the cover box and watching the trailer, I expected little more than beautiful eye candy with three attractive stars. What exactly could Scorsese bring to the issue of high society in the 1800's that hasn't been already addressed? As it turns out, quite a bit.With The Age of Innocence, Scorsese plays against type (if doing so as a director is possible) and dives straight into a genre that he is both not well known for as well as not directly familiar with. His lavish art direction and assured directing help make a familiar tale of doomed love breathe with new life. For example, one element of the film that I found fascinating was the film's use of colors to represent themes of the various characters. I love how the ""forbidden"" Ellen is always shown in dark, startling colors like bright blues, vibrant yellows, and blood reds whereas the pristine imagine of Mae is shown through light colors like soft, delicate pastels. As for the acting, I found it all to be uniformly superb. From Michelle Pfeiffer, as the fallen from grace Ellen, to the underrated work of Winona Ryder, as uptight May Welland, it all works.As for the twist ending, I wasn't really all that surprised. (SPOILER ALERT)For a movie that is very beautifully mounted and fully aware of its style over substance, it should come as no surprise that Archer doesn't end up with Ellen. In reality, he wouldn't have either. Image meant a lot in the 1800's...and still does today. Why give up his vision of perfection when it may not honestly be perfection at all? Our imagination of perfection is a lot more powerful than our reality of it.",N/A

1163755,"Then again, perhaps it is important to focus on his budding personality flaws before we assess all of the damage he has done to America's image with them. Somehow, Jr. has become something of an enigma-is he evil, or stupid? Stone leans toward stupid, but really, he portrays W as a misguided soul with inner conflicts that played into the hands of major power brokers with their own ideas about the future of the country. In light of all of W's early failures in most of his occupational endeavors, it's a convincing GUT of how Dub worked. Stone takes some of the sting out of all of W's recklessness and blundering and presents you an American portrait instead, which may prove infuriating to a good swath of viewers who are expecting a savaging of the Shrub. Brolin is fabulously all over his role as W, everyone else is solid save for Thandie Newton's mousey take on Condoleeza Rice. She had the look down, but her voice coach should have been flogged.A special note to idiots: there is no ""agenda"", no ideology, no ""belief system"", no ""liberal take"", or whatever phraseology you've been taught to mouth like automatons in the film. There is no doubt in any rational persons' mind that W's presidency is one of the most controversial to take place in modern history, and it deserves all of the scrutiny it gets. The real effect will be studied much further down the line, but it looks to me like Stone wanted to do a character/personality study rather than put focus on the horrendous mistakes he has made which may take decades to reverse, perhaps more.It's W the man, not W the monster. You can read a bazillion books about his policies-there is far less journalism on the boy king's inner workings, and we should welcome this angle as a compass to finding out a little more as to why he has done what he has done.",W
180505,"There are certain roles that actresses are born to play and Glenn Close was born to portray Cruella DeVille in ""101 Dalmatians"". Sure the puppies are adorable little creatures and Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson are a cute-looking couple, but Glenn is magnificent as the evil Cruella who wants the puppies destroyed to make a coat. Based on the animated Disney feature of the same name from 1961, Glenn must have studied the cartoon characterization of Cruella closely because everything from her voice patterns to her movements and eye gestures are identical to the original, and that was animation! A great film for the entire family, both young and old, I never get tired of watching this classic live-action feature. What the message of the film shows is that if your an evil person only looking out for yourself there are definite consequences; the villin always gets it in the end. Hugh Laurie(from TV's ""House"" fame) has a small supporting role playing one of the puppy thieves working for Cruella. This film has grossed so far over $300,000,000 at the world-wide boxoffice. A sequel entitled ""102 Dalmatians"", also starring Close, was released, but wasn't as successful.",N/A

This character should have got the revenge he deserved and then been allowed to go back into retirement. A miniseries could have been created around him alone. As for the demise of the little girl/guy hitman it was appropiate and well done but it should have been done by Omar. As for McNulty he got what he deserved as his drinking on the job and womanizing was really out of hand and discusting. The best story ending was Bubbles having dinner with his sister.

984252,"A city worships the visage of the bull until they decide to birth a living god for themselves. so they take a female and feed her to the desires of their self-made god, and out comes a beast that hungers and that needs. In order to sate their creation, people are forced into the lair of the beast in order to make sure it stays happy and doesn't have to turn to Hot Pockets. It also has a sadism to it, and this is reflected in the chase it gives as it takes its hatred out on the people that come in little chains of food. One person decides to challenge this, however, and enters the maze of the minotaur in order to both find his missing loved one and to slay the beast. And so the horror begins.First and foremost, if you watched this on television you have negated a lot of the movie. It becomes nothing but a chopped up variant of itself, and it will make you want to turn the channel. Next, forget for a second that there is a legend with a minotaur attached to it and that people know the name of the hero involved. Instead, look at this as a movie that embelishes and rewrites a things that never happened in the first place, and that makes a horrific thing live in a maze and consume people. Then envision the people and their fates and what great theatre that would make. That is how i see the city itself, with the fear it inflicts above reflected in the depths below. After that is done, imagine a thing that would be so horrid that you would be willing to take people and feed it whenever it hungers, knowing that it may get out of its maze and that it may come out and hunt yyour people.The concept is a terrible affair.While many people thought this movie was horrible, I liked it for a number of reasons. I left the knoowledge of the tales of yore at the doorstep, and I thought about the thing below. It was a horrible thing, too, and it had a stalking tendency that amounted to playing with its food. And why not - it is bigger than the bitten, more terrifying than anything people have ever seen, and it is tightly controlled by the sect that worships it to stay in power. This means that it would have amazing authority and that the name of the beast itself would evoke shutters in children and their older counterparts alike. Love is a strong thing, however, and love sends a person to challenge these assumptions about the thing that will not die. In this he assumes that it was born of man and that it can die as man, and so he enters the maze. And the drama that he saw above becomes a nightmare that he wasn't prepared for below.If you like B-movies and can overlook certaain things, then this might be your thing. I personally liked it quite a bit and do not understand all the negative reactions to it. I could IF people watched the cut versions, but the thing in the DVD was horrific to me. The writers went with a monster-god, too, and did challenge the old stories with a new tale. Still, it worked for me and it might work for you as well. Just keep an open mind, enjoy the blood and the agony, and think of the place you are entering. It would be terrible and then some, to say the least.",Minotaur

It has the ingredients to be very funny:  Will Farrell and John Riley are 40 year olds who still live with their single parents.  Once the parents hook up and get hitched, they're step brothers.  Just typing that has more comedic value than this feature film and what I wrote out wasn't very funny.You start with the script.  I believe I saw that Farrell actually had a hand in the screenplay and that is simply embarrassing.  This is the kind of garbage that could ruin a career in most cases, but when you look at the above names in the initial paragraph, these are the people who can really dig on people licking dried dog poop and a woman going #1 in a urinal in the mens bathroom.  Oh, you want more?  There's no toilet paper, so Will gets up, puts his rear end in the sink and uses a bath mat to wipe off?Unless you're a really lame 8 year old, I can't possibly understand what type of brain power someone must have to think anything is remotely entertaining about it.This is an actual scenario in this movie:  Farrell plays Riley's drums.  Riley gets mad and bashes Farrell in skull with cymbal.  Farrell acts like he's dead.  Riley drags Farrell outside and digs a grave.  Farrell gets up after Riley is in dug grave and hits Riley in head with shovel.  Farrell buries Riley alive.  Riley pops hand out of grave in backyard and crawls out of 7' of dirt.  Expletives proceed.  Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.  This is genius!!It does have a rare quality in which you're astonished at just how horrendous it is that you have to keep watching to see how much dumber it gets....and BINGO!!!  it succeeds.  I made my wife and her sister stay in the room when they begged for me to turn it off because I promised there's no possible way it could have a running time over an hour and thirty five minutes.  I think I was right even though it does seem like you're watching a 'Lonesome Dove' length mini-series.Your brain will hurt badly.  These guys run around and just group bad words together in a juvenile way.  I guess because it's Will Farrell and he says it, it's funny.  It's not at all.  The parents are even worse as they just sit around and scratch their heads, bewildered that their 40 year old kids are so goofy.I really appreciate Amazon.com and this forum because they don't have to publish these negative ads about a product they'rr selling, but I'm giving the best community service possible, here.

896425,"There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this video. It's the worse kind of Disney bottom budget Cash-In. They simply repackaged a few awful made-for-TV episodes that are too scary for younger viewers and too boring for older kids.This DVD contains a few Disney Princess stories that were obviously culled from the early 90's Disney Channel made-for-TV episodes. The animation is terrible - nothing like the movies, and even the colors of some of the characters are wrong. The quality of the artwork on the cover of the DVD is MUCH better than the animation on the DVD itself.The stories themselves are horrific. One has Ariel unable to laugh while evil blowfish cast spells on her companions. Then, there's a completely abridged version of Cinderella - using the movie's footage, it tells the whole story in about 5 minutes. The Jasmine / Aladdin story is atrocious. Besides the usual Disney Channel made-for-TV slipshod animation, you have Jasmine being turned into a scary snake and a bunch of bandits robbing them at knife point while Aladdin is drowning (!!!).The so-awful-it's-funny part of the DVD is the hacked together ""intros"" to each segment which are performed by Ariel, Cinderella, and Jasmine. The animators took what looks like 15 frames of the character's mouths moving (culled from some scene in the actual theatrical releases), and played them in a loop, and then just dubbed audio over it. No attempt is made to match their mouths to the audio that you hear. A real low rate hack job. I've seen better attempts on YouTube.",Disney Princess Stories: Beauty Shines From Within
1280167,"Just watched the DVD without having seen the Trailers or previous reviews.  Picked up the movie based on the quality of the actors and the description on the DVD case, a ""gripping suspense thriller"".  Based on the DVD case description we thought we were getting a Hitchcockian type suspense thriller.  Hardly!Plot synopsis:  Happily married couple...wife walks out the door and disappears about ten minutes into movie...husband spends remainder of movie tracking down, dealing with, and coming to terms with the emotional trauma created by ""The Other Man"".  Husband knows why wife disappears from the moment we see her leave in a slow motion shot...no mystery to him at all.  Too bad we are left hanging for the next forty-five minutes.  Her apparent disappearence early on has nothing to do with the plot other than to make us think we are watching a suspense thriller.  No guns, no chases, no violent confrontations, no 180 degree plot twists, and no surprise ending.  In fact, the ending is wierd and beguilling.  In our our view it seems tacked on and somewhat implausable.First rate acting and beautiful locale photography of Milan and Lake Como, Italy, make up, somewhat, for a disjointed plot and some odd film editing.  In the scenes following the wife's disappearance we literally stopped the DVD and wondered if it had skipped ahead a chapter by mistake.  Additionally, if we hadn't spent two years living near Milan and Lake Como we'd loose track of the continuous flashbacks and changes in plot locations.  This is a film requiring your full attention to keep up.Still, if we'd wanted to watch a lushly made ""Lifetime TV"" drama which confusingly unfolds revealing a love triangle, we'd rent this movie.  It just isn't what it describes itself to be.",N/A
1111512,"While this movie bears only memories of the Neil Gaiman's very excellent and funny Book, Stardust - it is a wonderful movie, one that you can really get your teeth into - and such great fun. A family(ish) movie, if you have older kids, and one with layers of good humour as well as some pretty Ghoulish stuff to keep you squirming.It starts, as all stories start, before the story begins - will so says the original book - although I loved the introduction in the movie too! The village of Wall is so named because of the wall which runs along beside it - with a guard to prevent anyone from getting through the wall to Faere on the other side. Dunstan Thorn (played by Prince Caspian actor - Ben Barnes) goes there one evening, jumping through the hole in the wall and ending up back home, and nine months later presented with a baby whose name according to the note is Tristan Thorn.Tristan (Charlie Cox) grows up rather insipidly pallid, and works in the shop where he longs to marry local girl Victoria (Sienna Miller. She is off-hand and sends him on a quest, through the wall, to find a fallen star.In Faere on the other side of Wall, Tristan discovers a new world, and that fallen stars are not lumps of rock, but rather beautiful and rather petulant, young women. However he captures her determined to take her back to Wall - to Victoria, to prove his love and to therefore win her hand in MarriageUnbeknownst to him, there are two other competing groups for the Fallen Star - Yvaine - (Played by Clare Danes). Firstly the competeing Princes of Stormhold, whose father the 81st King has flung the Ruby out the window - of the three sons left whoever gets it first gets to be King in his stead. It is the gem which has Knocked the star out of the sky.Then there is the Witch (MIchelle Pfeiffer) and her two sisters - called the Lilum in the book - who seek the star to cut out her heart so they can gain their youth and strength. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are from Pfeiffer who has to be careful about magic as it ages her and she only has so much of the last star's heart to use.The chase through Faere ensues, and includes a trip on lightening harvester with the wonderful Captain Shakespeare (Robert deNiro) camping it up - and his rough crew ""arrghhhhhhh!"" which is great fun.In the end it is a run to the end, and finding out what stars do best.While the movie loses some of Yvaines cynical petulance, there are truly wonderful touches in the movie. Not the least is Tristan's transformation in looks and acts from a pasty shop-boy to a confident young man.I have to confess a deep love for Neil Gaiman and his writing -and while this is not his book, I loved it.

And, it really sucks since we as the consumers suffer as a result. Unfortunately, we the viewers asked for this, so we have to take some responsibility. I have learned to cut out certain things in order to still afford my entertainment...BUT....And, remember, this is my opinion.....not a fact...Buying something like this, the price depends on how bad you really want it....how available it is anywhere else, the quality and the integrity of the merchant. What does owning this series mean to you? It is, in it's own way, a collectible. So that should be taken into consideration.Also, there might be some copyright issues to work out to get all of it on DVD. Let's face it, we all know about the mountains of paperwork required for cars & homes....and we aren't fully informed about what goes into producing older shows, from studios perhaps no longer in business or producers long deceased.An interesting fact, this is produced by CBS entertainment; and correct me if I am wrong--this series aired on ABC when it ran from 1978-1981. I was 2 at the time, but I remember Aaron Spelling being the ABC king with much of his series, even into the early 80's--Love Boat, TJ Hooker, Fantasy Island.....That could be an issue as well.However, this is to review the product itself.For me, yes, $25.99 (which is what I was charged) is well worth it. This series is over 30 years old, never found it's own audience as it followed behind Charlie's Angels. So it was destined to fail by the Powers That Be (PTB). Still, the people who remember it from back then or it's limited run in re-runs appreciate the fact that even some of it is available. I know I do.The DVDs are a great quality, given what the studios have to work with. And even on an HDTV with an HD upgradable DVD player, from a distance they look no worse than newer DVDs. There were no problems with skips, jumps or freezing. The case is around the same size as a standard DVD, which makes storage easy...especially if you have a lot of DVDs.They are snapped into place, so there are no issues with them popping out and moving, though with the shipping services that is not always guaranteed, but mine survived the postal service.All in all, if you want the series and have the money, pick it up.

1042492,"""The Departed"" (2006) is a thrilling, totally riviting crime-drama, directed by the award-winning Martin Scorsese, delivering what is undoubtedly his most enthralling film since the masterpiece ""Goodfellas"" (1990). ""The Departed"" was based on the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" by Alan Mak and Felix Chong. William Monahan delivered the scorching screenplay, crackling with savage, brutal wit while producers of ""The Departed"" included Brad Pitt, Brad Grey and Graham King. With such a high calibre team behind the scenes, the impressive array of A list actors all deliver magnificent performances, complimenting the stark blend of unflinching violence, harrowing, psychological drama and exhilirating, rip-roaring action scenes.Young Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a rookie, Boston-based cop. Billy grew up in a world surrounded by crime and violence. Billy's superiors, the diligient Queenan (martin Sheen) and ever-obnoxious, but straight, Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are desperate to catch notorious local mafia godfather Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and see Billy as the only suitable member of the team, given his background, to go undercover and trap Costello. Reluctantly Billy agrees, seeing he has little choice, and cunningly wins Costellos trust.The intriguing drama unravels further when, unbeknown to Billy, Queenan and Dignam, is that Costello had groomed sneaky and nauseating Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) to be his unscrupulous spy on the force. In a flash back sequence at the beginning of the film, it depicts that Costello had preyed upon Colin when he was just a young boy and brainwashed him to his evil, corrupt way of thinking.Heading the cast is another stunning performance from the versatile Leonardo Di Caprio as the mentally tortured undercover cop Billy Costigan. He conveys many dimensions to his character, giving it infinite depth. You get a more psychological insight into his character during the scenes where Billy pours his heart and anguish out to his understanding councellor, who he subsequently ends up having an on-off affair with (while she is dating Colin Sullivan).Jack Nicholson is devilishly evil as Frank Costello, the highly feared king of the underworld. His mere presence in the fim enhances the seedy, cut-throat atmosphere. Costello is clearly insane and when he discovers there's a ""rat"" among his team, his paranoya escalated further and he begins losing his mind. This is played with stark realism by Jack Nicholson who is in his best role in some years.Matt Damon plays the snake Colin Sullivan, Costellos mole, and shines in all of his scenes. On occasions during the film, you question whether you should really feel some empathy towards his character having clearly been brainwashed and manipulated by Costello when he was at a very impressionable age. However, upon witnessing Colin's underhand tricks and how he evidently wouldn't think twice of killing anyone he even suspects as getting in his way or bringing him down, you suddenly lose that slight sense of empathy.Even the luminous lead performances by Leonardo Di Caprio, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon have an extremely hard job not being upstaged by the stunning, scene-stealing supporting performances from Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen. The ultimate on-screen hard man, Ray Winstone, is terrifying as the cool, calm collected hitman Mr. French. Ray's understated performance is oscar worthy! He possesses a strong screen presence and the way he can shift from being composed to just suddenly gunning down somebody without even blinking, is ever-riviting to watch. Very edge of your seat stuff! Quite simply he steals any scene hes in and even Leonardo Di Caprio and Jack Nicholson seem slightly humble in his presence.Mark Wahlberg is also thoroughly fantastic in his memroable supporting turn as the snide Dignam. Dignam is, thankfully, on the right side of the law (until the end that is - wont say anymore as dont wish to spoilt it for those that yet to view this film) but revels in winding up undercover mole Billy and constantly cross paths with him, Colin and other members of the force. Mark Wahlberg richly compiments the rapid flow of the razor sharp dialogue and seemingly breezes into his character almost effortlessly. Martin Sheen is also of good value too, in his small but effective role of the more sympathetic detective Queenan while Alec Baldwin also delivers a scene-stealing performance as a passionate though often aggressive cop.With a gallery of top notch actors, an intriguing screenplay, first-class direction, rollercoaster dialogue, ""The Departed"" is an exceptional film, and nothing short of a masterpiece.The extras on this double disc set are all fascinating. they include additional scenes with introductions by Martin Scorsese and documentaries such as Stranger than fiction:The story of the Boston Mob, The real Life Gangster behind Jack Nicholsons character and theatrical trailer. Excellent value for money!Ian PhillipsSeptember 2009",The Departed
1274597,"The title of The Merry Gentleman, Michael Keaton's directorial debut, comes from the beginning of the film when hitman Keaton helps secretary Kelly MacDonald, who has fallen under a Christmas Tree she is trying to bring into her apartment.  Earlier, MacDonald saw Keaton standing on the ledge of a building across from her office.  Keaton had just made a ""hit"" and was contemplating suicide. It turns out that Keaton is a tailor who kills people on the side and hates himself for it.  Does he show up at MacDonald's door to kill her because she might be able to identify him?  After helping her bring her tree into her apartment, he walks away, only to return the next day to visit her.  Unfortunately, he has pneumonia and falls senseless the ground outside her apartment.  MacDonald finds him, gets him to the hospital, and a beautiful friendship is born -- on Christmas Day, no less.All this described action takes place in the first few minutes of the movie.  The rest of the film explores the relationship of Keaton and MacDonald, and it is well done.  If the film doesn't make much sense, we don't care because we are genuinely interested in what is going to happen to this odd couple.  The police are after Keaton and MacDonald's abusive husband is after her.  Will the police catch Keaton and will MacDonald's husband find her?  We care about the answers to these questions and watch with some interest as the plot plays out.As mentioned in the beginning of this review, this film is Michael Keaton's directorial debut.  He directs his cast, particularly MacDonald, reasonably well, but the story is confusing, particularly his own role as hitman.  All the characters related to the hitman part of the story are given marginal status in the film.  They appear, disappear, and are forgotten.  We have no idea what motivates Keaton and this is a problem.  How are we to understand his behavior towards MacDonald?  He kills people mercilessly, yet he is kind and caring toward MacDonald.I have been careful to avoid mentioning any spoilers in this review.  I recommend the film because the Keaton/MacDonald story is genuinely interesting and well done.  At the very end the viewer can decide what sense it all makes.  I must admit confusion and some slight disappointment.",N/A
1175065,"This movie was recommended to me by my martial arts instructor (Sonny Ray Couch ).When I got it I was just expecting your average fight movie, but worth watching to pick up on a few things. But little did I know that it was going to be not only one of the best martial arts films I've seen in a long time, but one of the best movies in general. The story is very deep and very well could be a true story(Yes I know it's not). It was just real and deep.The fighting is amazing as well. The movies they do are not what you see in most films. Which some may or may not like this. I loved it, because it was more real. The actors really went threw a lot to get this made. You can get a taste of that by watching what few special features there are. While there isn't many of them they are really good.I practice a style  called Cat Ching Do (Wanna learn more read info in profile) and felt a lot of what they were trying to do is much like what we do.  Even some of the same things the man tells his students I've been told countless times.Also you should note this is set more about the teaching side of things than the fighting or learning.So if you want something other than that pass on by.This would be a good one for the whole family, because the story has something for everyone, then add in all other things going on and and it has a solid foundation.I only rented this, But I plan to buy it. I don't spend money on martial arts movies unless I really like them. This is worth every penny.Enjoy!",N/A
1233623,"[...]Donnie Darko was truly an original and memorable movie. Darko was written and directed by a young and gifted filmmaker named Richard Kelly. The movie struck a massive chord with its intended audience after the studio botched its theatrical run. The DVD sold like hotcakes and was one of my favorite films of 2001. Flash forward to the here and now and we have S. Darko, a pseudo-intellectual wet noodle of a debacle. S. Darko is nearly unwatchable and easily the worst film of the year so far. Poorly acted (most of the miscast young actors stumble around vacantly and able to produce a single emotion), written, and directed, its a miserable movie-watching experience.S. Darko is about Donnie's sister Samantha (a broody and sullen Emo) who wanders around with another sneering Emo on a road trip to So Cal. Their car breaks down in a hellish small town in Utah populated by a hunky mechanic (a comatose Chuck Bass from Gossip Girl). Chuck smokes and tries to look edgy and seductive in Hanes white T-shirts in an odd bid to prove his heterosexuality, but he fails miserably, much like the movie in general. The other characters include Iraq Jack (wtf), a totally miscast and awful James Lafferty of the popular CW teen soap One Tree Hill. We also get a dumb cop, freaky Christians and an embarrassed looking Elizabeth Berkley of Showgirls and Saved by the Bell fame, blurting out some of the worst dialogue ever written. The plot has the basic conceits of the first film, minus any kind of menace, style, or wit. The bunny mask is there, the head has barbed wire around it so Iraq Jack can mutilate himself. A gratuitous and gruesome scene ensues. There's so many holes in the movie, I lost track after 50 or so. At one point meteorites start falling all around and no one seems to notice or care. The combination of the awful CGI and the non-reaction from the dead cast did produce some laughs. At this point I lost the will to keep going.S. Darko sucks. Fans of the original movie deserve better than this turd. This film should have never been made. I lost at least 20 IQ points during this flick. I need to rinse the memory of this flick from my mind forever. I still have no idea what possessed me to watch this movie in the first place, I knew it was going to be terrible.

990029,"I wanted SO much to like Ultraviolet,but it is plagued by poor editing and subplots that are either unfinished or thatsimply go nowhere.It is all look but no substance.The movie starts with Ultra telling us""I was born into a world,you may not understand"".Truer words were never spoken.The story concerns a research organization that alters a virus that has been around for centuries.The intention is to create stronger and faster soldiers;instead they create a contagion.We are told by a voice over by Ultra that she contracted the disease when her husband was killed(blood splattered on her),which in turn killed her unborn infant.As a result she fled underground and formed a resistance.A few scenes later we get our first plot contradiction,as she enters the research facility under the guise of being a courier to pick up a package.She gets the suitcase containing the ""weapon"" but her cover is blown when the real courier shows up.As she fights her way out security identifies her as one who has been confined to the facility in the past for EXPERIMENTATION and whose pregnancy was PURPOSEFULLY terminated(!?).She was human at one time but is now a hemophage like the rest of the resistance.The movie continues as she heads back to resistance headquarters and at one point stops to look inside the white case she carries.She discovers the ""weapon"" is a young boy.Her priorities,for some reason we're not privy to,change and she suddenly becomes a protective mother;totally opposite to the character we've so far seen.She spirits the boy away from the resistance leaders and turns to a fellow hemophage by the name of Garth for help.For some reason which again we are not privy to,Ultra needs a blood transfusion and Garth,who has pointy teeth,says it's lucky she didn't ""convert"" with her light exposure(?).After testing the boy he tells Ultra he doesn't have ""vampiral anti-genetic blood""(??);in fact he is useless to them.So Garth is a ...vampire too?While there the boy writes some chemical symbols on a magazine and Garth files it away for future reference(as we shall see).At this point there seems to be some kind of feelings between Garth and Ultra but that sub plot is not furthered in any way.The boy apparently is dying and when Daxus,the head of the research facility,contacts Ultra to get the boy back she finally relents when Daxus reveals he is the father.She takes him to a mall to leave him there but she again cannot bring herself to go through with it but the boy runs away and is caught by her own resistance.She fights and succeeds in freeing him from their grasp.Daxus finally talks Ultra into bringing the boy directly to the research facility and she shows up;but unbeknownst to Daxus,as a hologram.Daxus reveals that the boy really contains an anti-human vuris.The hemophages are no longer a threat to him so he's created a new menace people will line up at his doors to get the antidote for.It doesn't take long for Daxus to realize Ultra is not real but by this time she is long gone with the boy.They end up in a playground where the boy in a short time finally dies.With a teary Ultra kneeling over him,she is killed by Daxus who has followed her via a tracking device in the boy.Next thing we see is Ultra waking up having been revived by Garth.We also now see for the first time that Ultra has vampire teeth!? Garth is also NOW suddenly convinced that thewriting the boy did on that mag cover he stashed away,is a cure for the hemophages!? Ultra is not moved as she thinks the boy is still alive.Of course the showdown has to happen between Daxus and Ultra and a battle royale it is.During it we learn that Daxus has hemophage blood also so the fight goes neck in neck until Ultra finally triumphs.She and the boy are united.The boy WAS alive because the hemophage cells in her tears helped to transform him also into a hemophage.I have left alot out but I think you get the general idea.As the movie progresses the plot incongruities make things go from bad to worse as one can easily lose track of what is happening.Characters are doing things from motivations only known to them.The resistance movement lives in a spiral tipped building.They own the first half while a chinese gang,Ultra battles,owns the top portion.And after the battle,how she gets from the rooftop to a street level area with the boy in hand is not explained.Things like this are thrown out at you continually.Even the special effects have their lax moments.During a chase scene on a motorcycle Ultra is travelling first alongside an office building then straight up until she reaches the roof.While she is in midair her image gets shaky which effectively ruins the power of the moment and of the special effect itself.I know nothing of the history or creation of this film but I am certain there was alot of footage that got cut out here and what an obvious hatchet job was done too.It is like a puzzle that not only got reassembled improperly but with pieces missing!Either studio pressure,budget constraints or both got this thing whittled down,but at the price of the integrity of the picture.What a disappointment to such a promising property.For those interested the picture and sound quality are excellent here.The special features contained therein consist of the trailer,a 30 m ""UV Protection-The Making of UltraViolet"" short and optional commentary to the movie by star Milla Jovovich.Give this one a definite pass.",N/A

With Joely Fisher as his wife, Joy, and Step and Jeff Woodcock as his younger neighbors, the show becomes a running comedic commentary on marriage. The episodes contrast the two couples, old vs. young, cynical vs. naive, in a series of bizarre scenarios.Unfortunately, the show seemed to get a bit too comfortable and routine in the second season. Unlike his character Robert in ""Raymond,"" Garrett's character in ""Til Death"" gets a bit too cynical, and thus boring. Joy just gets on my nerves.

1204021,"I'm neither a teen, tween, or a grade school ""twilighter"". Instead, I am probably one of the oldest commentators here. Let me give you some sage advice--Chill Out!!! Many reviews and comments I've read about the movie in particular seem to be missing the central theme--the ""Twilight Saga"" is a love story between two unlikely soulmates, one of whom happens to be a vampire, and the journey they embark on together & obstacles they face in order to be together. Please tell me I'm not the only one who ""gets"" that central point. So, why would you expect a ghoulish horror fest of a film? The dominant theme of the film is Edward & Bella's meeting and developing love story and that's EXACTLY what the film should be about. Stewart does a great job as logical, pragmatic Bella--who finds herself swept up in an unlikely situation when her soulmate, Edward, turns out to be a member of the undead. Pattinson does a fine job as the romantic vampire, who steals Bella's heart & complicates both their lives by falling in love with a mortal.In a rare occurrence, this movie is what got me into the Stephanie Meyer books. I truly believe the ""Twilight Saga"" is the next Harry Potter phenomenon. The movie was terrific, RP & KS are terrific together and exude incredible chemistry, the tension is real, raw, & passionate, and you root for Edward & Bella all the way. I'm looking forward to seeing Stewart & Pattinson continue to bring this saga and Bella & Edward's destined love story to life on film to its completion.",N/A

I actually liked the movie more than they did.  Most of them responded after the viewing that they thought the filmmakers must have taken a lot of license with the story because it just didn't seem realistic to them.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised when I bought the dvd and listened to the commentary and watched the interviews of the real individuals involved that the story was NOT altered appreciably from what really happened.  Other than the setting of the taste test near the end of the movie (which was actually done indoors in Paris - not outdoors in the countryside) most of the events portrayed in the movie really did happen - and they make for a very entertaining film, as well as teaching a little history of the California wine business.  If you have any interest in wine making - or wine drinking - this is an excellent movie that I'm sure you'll both enjoy and learn something from.  I know I did.",Bottle Shock
59998,"Directed by John Woo, Hard Target (1993) was the acclaimed Hong Kong director's first film for an American studio.  Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (Timecop), the film features some of Woo's trademark techniques for action and violence, involving fights, shootouts, pyrotechnics, and vehicular stunts.  While the story itself is pure fantasy, Hard Target is a rather entertaining comic book adventure that features a high level of violence, presented straightforwardly without a high degree of humor.Set in New Orleans, the story revolves around a mysterious group led by Emil Fouchon (Lance Hendrickson), that arranges for wealthy clients to hunt humans like prey.  The victims are usually down on their luck, ex-military vets, who are promised a large sum of money if they survive the deadly game.  Coming from the success of Universal Soldier (1992), Van Damme was entering his prime.  As Chance Boudreaux, he comes to the aid of Natasha `Nat' Binder (Yancy Butler) whose missing father is a losing player in Fouchon's game.  As the pair look into the disappearance of the woman's father, they soon learn his fate.  Things start to unravel, and the body count starts to climb, as Boudreaux finds himself the target of Fouchon's motley group of recreational killers.Fouchon is menacing and talks tough, but does not have the fighting skills or stones, to back it up.  Number two heavy, Pick Van Cleef (Arnold Vosloo), is pretty mean and evil, in a two dimensional way, and certainly looks the part, but his exit from the film is rather lame.  Yancy Butler (Witchblade) does a good job at looking scared, shocked, and surprised.  What scant intentional humor there is, comes from Wilford Brimley, who plays Boudreaux's Uncle Douvee.  With a heavily overdone Cajun accent, Mr. Oatmeal takes on armed baddies with his bow and arrow.The premise that manhunts could take place in the middle of New Orleans is pretty absurd, but with some nicely done action sequences, Hard Target is worth a look just to view John Woo's pyrotechnic style.  Woo apparently wanted some script changes before he would agree to direct, and then when Van Damme was cast, the level of action was amped up.  The strong supporting cast allows the focus to widen from just being about Van Damme.  From here, Woo would put things together, in films like Broken Arrow (1996), and Face/Off (1997).",Hard Target
1252696,"The DVD:The Hurt LockerKatherine Bigelow  seems an unlikely choice for the directorial helm of Matt Boal's script for a war-themed independent film, ""The Hurt Locker"" (and the title's unlikely, too).  Boal was last seen penning ""In the Valley of Elah"" , in which he turned a laudable screenplay from a hauntingly true story he had written for Playboy.  I personally think that Boal was arm-wrestled into many of the aspects of the screenplay by powerful director and co-writer Paul Haggis during ""In the Valley"".  That, in fact, might be why Boal sought out someone who was more concerned about seeing the realism of the war in Iraq as it is, and not trying to politicize a story.  The story, simply, is one  of every day Americans confronted by the need to put their lives on the line in a country that is as hellish as the Iraq in 2004, in the wake of our great adventure there.Hand-held camera shoots in ""The Hurt Locker"" give the gritty, real appearance of Iraq in the film.  Bigelow shot in  Jordan, when she could not overcome obstacles to filming in Kuwait, and the camera scenes can make one weary, in 137 minutes of film, But most of the film is so gripping, and the scenes portrayed do have a tendency to make everyone involved weary, weary of the war.  Bigelow and Boal don't have to preach that war is hell, they just portray it in the realism of the film.  We get it.The story line involves a 3 person EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit, charged with finding and clearing explosive devices that seemingly litter the landscape in Iraq.  I've done some fiction and non-fiction reading about bomb techs in metropolitan areas in the US, and recognize that the specialty is populated with people who live their lives knowing that the next assignment could cost them those self-same lives.  Not a vocation for the weak at heart.  As the film begins, the trio in the EOD Hummer includes the bomb tech, Sgt. Thompson (Guy Pearce in a good cameo), the driver, Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie, largely unsung before this film),  and the Specialist, who acts as the lookout and the turret gun in the Hummer, Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).  The three work well together.In shocking and violent order, Thompson breathes his last, and is replaced with Staff Sgt James (Jeremy Renner who was cast as Dahmer early in his career in the film of the same name. Renner has kicked around film and TV since then - he appeared as a lead in ""The Unusuals"" in this TV season, opposite Amber Tamblyn.  It was not renewed.).  As James, Renner has turned in a performance so finally nuanced, that his name will no doubt come up at Oscar time.Sanborn and Eldridge don't know what to make of the new bomb tech, who is silent and somewhat reckless, a contrast to the confident Thompson, who was a team player.  Over the course of their time with him, you can sense the two of them swinging into his rhythm, learning to anticipate his quirky style and the aplomb with which he's handled 800 explosive devices.  Attribute this to the strong delivery Renner brings to the ""silent cowboy"" type.  The unit has only 39 days left on their tour.With Eldridge, and to a lesser degree, Sanborn, your sense is that they are waiting on the edges of their chairs for the tour to be over, so that they can escape with their lives and revisit the hellish assignment in dreams.  With James, you get the feel that the 39 days is not enough; that only when he is pursuing his special trade does he feel at one with the world.  There are sidelines to James' story; one in his relationship with a young Iraqi boy, and one in his inability to shoulder his homelife with wife and young son.Because of their vocation, and because of the reality of the fear in the Iraqi streets, the intensity in this film makes time pass swiftly, absorbs the viewer in the reality.  The actual bombs are stark in their violence, the feel of the streets is that of underlying deception.  There is a scene in the last half of the film where the unit encounters a group of contractors (cameos by Ralph Fiennes and David Morse), that potentially could have come out in editing, but it serves as a contrast of what the different dangers are when EOD units are exposed in the open desert, and not in the city streets.And ""the hurt locker"" of the title?  It stands for a collection kept by James of items found at the bomb scenes; items that immediately call each scene to mind in the collection of nightmares that he's grown addicted to.  And he is addicted; never doubt that.Realistic and timely, ""The Hurt Locker"" may be one of the best movies you can see this year.",N/A

1176860,"The DEVIL'S CHAIR presents an amalgam of Horror themes that are quite familiar to the seasoned viewer. For example, the mix consists of elements and visuals borrowed from: the HELLRAISER series, ALIEN, SESSION 9, HIGH TENSION and the SAW franchise. Admittedly, the blend is deftly arranged and done so as not to give too much away and spoil the ending. Despite having been produced on a modest budget, DEVIL'S CHAIR has a look and feel that is light years beyond what it cost to produce. It is well filmed and acted, though I never entirely warmed to the main character, (though I suspect that this observation is more subjective in nature). Perhaps had the character of Nick WEST been portrayed as a more vulnerable and sensitive individual, he may have evoked increased pathos. In that event it would certainly have played more with the viewer's mind. Instead, I found this character to be in the Bruce WILLIS vein. Perhaps that is what the film maker wished for, though it did not work as well as it could have, in my opinion. I would develop this theme more, however, I wish not to spoil the film for the uninitiated. DEVIL'S CHAIR should appeal to those who prefer psychological Horror, even though they are not afraid to venture down gore alley. Yes, there is gore here and it is reasonably well done, (though the Director held back in some scenes). There is also a creature, (pay no attention to the lousy keep-case artwork). I was disappointed that the film revealed too much in the way of graphics at the outset as they let the ""cat out of the bag"", to some degree. Also, the use of the so-called fourth wall, where the actor provides a monologue to the audience, was a device used with annoying frequency. As the film was well crafted, one did not need these snippets of dialogue which were thrust at the viewer without warning. All they served to do was spoil the visual & auditory flow of the film. Further, that Director Adam MASON also brought us that highly questionable movie, BROKEN. Nonetheless, the DEVIL'S CHAIR represents a vast improvement and the former may represent a blip in the Director's creative output. Albeit somewhat ""artsy-fartsy"", I feel that the DEVIL'S CHAIR is recommended viewing.",The Devil's Chair

Easily, this is the defining year of the show --- it looks as if DYNASTY is perched to become the best TV series ever!Season 3: the writing starts to go awry... things don't make sense, non-sequiturs abound, the plotting becomes an afterthought, and too much dialogue is given over to empty sentiments of love/hate and the characters telling each other how fabulous they are. Also, the misguided new static acting directive from the producers damages the performances, unnecessarily ruining the feel of many scenes.Season 4: the 1983/84 year is cited as the peak season for the wealth-based nighttimes soaps of the '80s, and while DYNASTY's riding high in some ways, the goofy, stilted problems from the previous season continue... The very first episode of the year is really quite taut and focused, but it's all downhill from there: Joseph commits suicide after trying to kill Alexis, but the show never fully explains why he set fire to Steven's cabin with her inside it. We know it has something to do with Alexis holding secrets about Kirby's mother --- but what? She was crazy, we already know that... No matter. After Kirby makes a lame attempt at strangling Alexis, the butler's orphaned daughter agrees to marry her rapist, Adam... Then the show initiates a promising plotline about someone stalking Alexis and ransacking her penthouse suite, yet that plot is dropped and forgotten without explanation... Who was doing it??... Claudia weds Steven so Blake can't take away his child in court, then the couple promptly forgets it was a marriage of convenience...  Fallon gets taken in by a slimy slice of Eurotrash, Peter DeVilbis, inexplicably cast with the corpse-like Helmut Berger whose lines appear to be dubbed or shoulda been. When she realizes she's been had by this nasally mumbling opportunist, she runs into traffic and gets one of those Carrington Family Headaches the show seems so fond of; in fact, the headaches get so bad, she suddenly realizes she's loved Jeff Colby all along and wants to remarry him for no convincing reason... Blake's public-relations girl, Tracy Kendall, decides the way to get back at Krystle for taking the promotion she's hoped for is to seduce Krystle's husband in the most lazily-staged, pathetically transparent attempts imaginable... Alexis gets a new boyfriend, the effetely macho Dex Dexter, who just waltzes into her office, lays a kiss on her, and they're together forever! Only their relationship will never make any sense until Season 9 (which is a long time to wait, I'm tellin' ya!)... The cast actually goes to film in Denver for the only time in the series' history, but it remains inside the entire time, ignoring the opportunity to obtain any exterior location footage whatsoever... Diahann Carroll shows up at the end of the year to make a now-obligatory Mysterious Entrance, and she never gets anything else to do for the next three years except hand her brother, Blake, the occasional check to ""save my company, dammit!"" as she's apparently now his banker.Nothing goes anywhere. The writers no longer seem to have a story they feel compelled to tell.At least Alexis briefly takes on a sultry, smokey-voiced sense of her own statured coolness for Season 4, causing her to seem like the only person in the Rocky Mountains who might have even a clue as to what they're actually doing --- although her spontaneous Dietrich solo rountine in a cowboy bar to seal some nonsensical oil deal doesn't go far in proving it.Oh, how good this show seemed to be a just couple of years earlier!

Only the diamonds and cashmere are of acceptable quality.No wonder Paramount is now splitting up each season into two over-priced packages: the show is completely schizophrenic!","Dynasty: Season 4, Vol. 1"

If that is true, then it is only half right. In the Ghost of Frankenstein; the monster is burned alive in a chateau. Yet with Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, the Monster is found frozen not burned and it is underneath a castle not a chateau. If you remember at the end of the Ghost of Frankenstein; Ygor brain is put inside the Monster and thus he speaks. With Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, the Monster ability to speak is gone. It is reported that Bela Lugosi (who played the Monster) has speaking lines. They were all cut from the movie and in some parts of the movie you can see the Monster's lips move as if he was trying to talk. When Bela Lugosi played the Monster (a roll he original turned when first offer to him and made Boris Karloff famous) he was 60 years old and needed three stuntmen for him because the costume weighed him down.

1034482,"Jake Feldman (Meat Loaf) runs a sweat shop specializing in fake furs. His frustration  with his lack of quality furs causes him to lash out at his mostly immigrant staff. What frustrates Jake even more are the unreturned advances of a stripper named Shanna (Ellen Ewusie) whom he is obsessed with. Jake pays her nightly visits and on one particular night things take a  terrifying turn in Jake's life . After he  almost rapes Shanna he gets a phone call from a trapper named Jameson (John Saxon). Jameson and his son have just caught the most beautiful raccoon furs imaginable and he is  offering Jake first pick of the merchandise. Before Jake can meet up with Jameson, Jameson's son, under the mysterious influence of the furs murders his father by bashing his head in with a metal bat and takes his own life by diving headfirst into a bear trap. The gore in this film is ridiculous and  over the top but still disgusting. It surprises me that this film aired with all of its extreme violence  yet Takashi Miike's offering was deemed too disturbing.  Once Jake sees the pelts he could care less about the mutilated bodies he has to step over to get to his prized possession. He declares them the best pelts he has seen in  twenty years and believes that they are just what he needs to get the two things he wants most out of life : a successful business and Shanna. He pays Shanna a visit at work (what she is doing when Jake arrives is  funny and erotic) and asks her to model the furs in an upcoming fashion show. Sensing an opportunity to manipulate Jake further Shanna teases him with sexual advances before agreeing to his wish. She wants the furs for herself. Jake does a little investigating and discovers that the furs are a special kind coming from magical raccoons who once presided over their own city. They were the guardians of that city and the magical powers that they once possessed now cause anyone who comes into contact with these furs to commit violent acts of self mutilation and murder. Each murder is in keeping with how these animals are slaughtered.  The film is a little goofy and over the top but Argento knows what people expect from  him and he doesn't disappoint. The murders are gross and there is tons of blood and intestines spilling all over the screen. Easier on the eyes is Shanna who is  a stripper who actually takes her clothes off in a movie. Some films you might read that an actress is half naked for most of the film but in this case it's not an exaggeration. Actress Ellen Ewusie appears nude in every scene that she has in this film.  Meat Loaf is a lot of  fun as Jake. His portrayal of a sleazy guy driven mad  by desire was so intense that I was reminded of Jack Nicholson at times. John Saxon makes you wish he had more scenes before he is brutally murdered. The score by regular Argento composer Claudio Simonetti is very spooky and recalls the nursery rhyme from Deep Red in a couple of scenes towards the end. Pelts is gross as hell but it's one of the funnest horror films in a while since it tells a crazy story about murderous raccoons and features  tons of gratuitous gore and nudity.",Masters of Horror: Pelts

1213686,"If you have read any previous reviews of this film and wish to see it, you may suffer from great expectations.  Not only the worst thing Dickens ever wrote but the easiest way to kill what might otherwise have been an enjoyable romp at the movies.  I'm not sure that lowering one's expectations would've helped this one too much.  Even in bad movies, one can still enjoy themselves by feeling ""involved"".  I found it very hard to relate to the main character.The film starts with forbidden love between a Thai mafia women named Zin (Ammara Siripong) and a Yakuza (Hiroshi Abe) that results in an autistic baby girl.  The Thai mafia separates the couple and Zin raises the girl, Zen (newcomer JeeJa Yanin).  Zen grows up watching martial arts films and running from flies.  She has an uncanny ability to mimic the intricate moves she sees on the screen, in addition to other skills.  When her mother falls ill and cannot afford the treatment, Zen and her friend find a diary that list many people who owe money to Zin.  Zen then goes about retrieving said cash.I have been super-geeked about seeing this ever since I watched the trailer last year sometime.  To call it a letdown would be an understatement.  I expected the plot to be crap, so I wasn't too upset about that.  I wanted to see the cool fights that everyone was talking about.  Other than the last 20 minutes of the film, the fights suck.  Zen goes to place after place demanding cash.  She is then laughed at and attacked.  She fights dude after dude until the boss is scared and hands over the money.  These fights consist of being attacked one by one, with every dude throwing one punch (that's so slow a statue could dodge it) before getting kicked in the face.HOWEVER I will admit that the finale is AWESOME!  The last 20 minutes will induce more than its fair share of cringes as stunt-men earn their money the old-fashioned way:  Brutally!  The whole bag of tricks is emptied here.  Some fantastic Muay Thai moves with a little Tae Kwon Do thrown in.JeeJa Yanin is more than capable of performing some sweet moves and I can't wait to see her in more stuff.  This, however, I probably could've done without.  The presentation from the Magnolia DVD is stellar with a widescreen picture and the option of an English dub or subtitles.  The special features are limited to a ""making of"" segment.  I may be the only person who doesn't like this movie (as a whole), so please take my review with a grain of salt.  I tried to be objective and move past those pesky expectations I mentioned earlier.  I'm also the ONLY person that didn't like ""Drunken Master"".  2.5 to 3 stars, but the last act is 5-star quality.2008.  aka:  Fury",Chocolate
1280591,"My wife and I recently made plans to go check out a movie with another couple.  When differences arose on which movie we were to see, ""G.I. Joe:  The Rise of Cobra"" became the choice of compromise.  Despite having played with G.I. Joe toys and watching the cartoon series when I was young, I fully planned to wait for this film to hit the DVD shelves before I watched it.  There just wasn't anything too appealing about it based on the previews.Having now viewed it I must say that it was a pleasant surprise.The plot is rather simple.  In this film, James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston), an arms dealer with a checkered family history, joins forces with a sinister scientist known only as The Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the duo plan to take over the world by threatening it with nanomite weapons.  These weapons can literally eat through metal (and pretty much everything else).  When a convoy of these weapons, led by two soldiers codenamed Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans), is attacked and the nano-weapons are stolen, the international force known as G.I. Joe is sent to retrieve them.From that point on, the film is basically one CGI-laced battle after another.  Fight sequences go from the Joe headquarters to France to the icy waters of the North Pole.  Hand-to-hand combat, ""accelerator"" suits, ninjas, computerized crossbows, etc. all take center stage as the action spills out on the screen.Like many other big-budget action yarns this film suffers in a number of areas.  Heading the list of things that are wrong with this film is Channing Tatum.  He tries to come across as a leader but instead looks more like a lightweight John Cena (WWE).  Tatum ain't no Duke, and his performance here goes to show that his poor delivery in ""Havoc"" was no misstep on his part.  Another thing wrong with this film is the fact that it's covered in cheese.  Granted, it's based on a toyline from the 80's, but it would have been nice if the film had been taken a bit more seriously.  Otherwise, the scriptwriters should have gotten rid of some of the strong language and aimed for a more kid-friendly PG rating.I also found that despite the busy nature of the film, it was rather boring at times.  With little character development, it became nothing more than a ""that explosion was cool, but wait until you see the next one"" series of CGI sequences.There's plenty that's bad about this film, but there is also quite a bit that is good.  As nothing more than an action film, it works wonders.  The CGI does look excellent and the numerous vehicles and weapons that are used in the film turned out great.Although Tatum was miscast as Duke, the majority of the other characters were given decent representations.  Mired in bad one-liners, Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as Hawk.  Christopher Eccleston is sufficient as McCullen/Destro, but much like Quaid he has to swim his way through bad writing.  Rachel Nichols (Scarlett) gives one of the best performances in the film, and Said Taghmaoui is quite enjoyable as Breaker.  Sienna Miller filled out the Baroness' black suit quite well, but her delivery was only average.Other actors who did quite well were Ray Park as the silent and deadly Snake Eyes, Lee Byung-hun as Snake Eyes' arch enemy, Stormshadow and Arnold Vosloo in a small but sinister role as Zartan.Two actors in particular deserve kudos for their performances in this film.  When I first saw that Marlon Wayans was going to portray Ripcord, I immediately smelled a stinky film.  However, Wayans does surprisingly well as the humorous Ripcord.  Deserving even more praise is Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Although he wasn't perfect as the Doctor/Cobra Commander, he has shown marked improvement from his ""Havoc"" and ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" days.  He was a pleasant surprise.There are also a few old faces that pop up.  Director Stephen Sommers reached deep into his ""The Mummy"" bag and pulled out Vosloo, Brendan Fraser in a cameo role and Kevin J. O'Connor as Dr. Mindbender.  Screen veteran Jonathan Pryce (""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Twelve Monkeys"") plays the President of the United States.Overall, ""G.I. Joe:  The Rise of Cobra"" is a mixed bag of great action sequences and solid individual performances weighed down by a poor choice for a leading man, a dull script and too much focus on the ""wow"" factor.  If you like pop, sizzle, and bang in your movies, ""Joe"" is an excellent film to check out.  If you expect your films to develop a little bit more and not rely on CGI to cover up weaknesses, you might want to stay away from ""The Rise of Cobra.""  Mildly recommended to action fans.  I'll probably buy it once it's been out on DVD awhile and the price goes down.",N/A
696976,"My brother suggested we watch this.  Normally I don't care for his  movie choices because he loves Star Trek and action films.  WOW, this is a  GREAT MOVIE. I think the only reason anyone would give it less than ten stars :) is that they do not pay close enough attention in the beginning. SO, without spoilers I will explain the beginning....A man is in love and also has a best friend.  The man gets a promotion at work (basically) and when he does...he proposes.  Soon after, he is approached by Napoleon (no, this is not a boring history film, not at all!) and is asked to carry a letter to someone.The man is caught helping Napoleon and put in a horrible, underground prison.  He makes a friend there (a priest) and spends all of his time plotting revenge.Well, I can tell you, this movie is one where you get to the end and say ""Wow, I wish I could watch that for the first time AGAIN!""

645928,"I have used a review of ""The Best Of Leonard Cohen"" CD as the start of my review of the DVD ""Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man"" because I believe that the questions that I had about his place in musical history get resolved, partially, in the film:""The Best Of Leonard Cohen, Leonard Cohen, CBS Records, 1975Leonard Cohen always seemed to me to be the odd man out in the swirl of the folk revival of the early 1960's. Yes, sure he did his time at the Chelsea Hotel (something of a rite of passage for some singer/songwriters). He certainly, either through his music or lifestyle, did not merely represent some hippie faddism. He was just a little too old and little too proper writer, in the European sense, for that. Yet, although some of his material could well be played in the beat caf&eacute;s of the late 1950's, there too his work seems too civilized for that raucous crowd. A viewing several years ago of a film documentary on his life, work and times ""I'm Your Man"" only added to my confusion about where to pigeonhole Mr. Cohen.So now you see my dilemma. In any case the best place to start to get an appreciation for the work of this very talented and driven lyricist (I cannot say much for his vocal accomplishments as it will be the lyrics that will stand the test of time, not the voice) is this compilation of his best work, circa 1975. Haven't we all had, or wanted to have, male or female, that ""Suzanne"" of the first song. This is probably his best known song, and I think rightly so as a secondary anthem of the 1960's. Included here are the heart-wrenching lyrics of ""Bird On A Wire"", as well as ""Sisters Of Mercy"" and ""So Long, Marianne"". Cohen tips his hat to the Chelsea Hotel experience in ""Chelsea Hotel No. 2"". As I run through this list there is one thought that does occur to me. If you are in a depressed or melancholy mood it is best to save this CD for some other time. But do listen to it.""Those remarks receive some answers in this well-done 2005 part biographic sketch and part tribute concert (down in Sydney, Australia). The parts about his driven personal life from the days when he held forth in the poetry circles of his native Montreal, his evolution as a lyricist during his key stay at the Chelsea Hotel (basically absorbing the vibrant folk lyric/ poetic milieu of New York City, the center of the cultural universe back in those days), and his long time commitment to the rigors of Buddhism round his story and give a better sense of the demons that drove his work.The concert segments interspersed between the Cohen commentaries are the real reason to view this DVD though. I mentioned in the review of the CD (and Cohen, with a measured sense of his own creative skills, confirms in this film) that Leonard Cohen would be remembered for his lyrics not for his voice. By that I did not mean that his work could not be well-covered by others. And this Sydney concert is the proof. Of course any time you have the McGarrigle Sisters, Anna and Kate and the Wainwright kids (Kate's kids), Rufus and Martha (Martha outshines Rufus here, if you can believe that), you know that there is a solid base to the show. Add in Linda Thompson, Beth Orton and others covering Cohen classics like ""Suzanne"", ""Sisters Of Mercy"", and Chelsea Hotel"", to name a few, and this is quite a tribute show. Additionally, there is as segment with the ubiquitous Bono and the U2 crowd doing their part by ""aiding"" Cohen's singing on a newer song ""Tower Of Sound"" and the title entry ""I'm Your Man"". This is good stuff for Cohen aficionados and newcomers alike.",N/A

1150225,"Harvey Shine is down to last chances:  his job as a commercial jingle writer is hanging by a thread; his estranged daughter is getting married, giving him perhaps one last chance to reconcile and make amends, and his lonely life has perhaps one last chance at romance.  He flies to London for the weekend to attend the wedding, only to get a cool reception from the wedding party, and when his daughter tearfully informs him that she wants her stepfather (James Brolin) to give her away, you can see his heart break.  Meanwhile, never-married Kate Walker has a thankless job as an airport survey taker, and a demanding mother (Eileen Atkins).  When she's set up on yet another blind date, this time with a younger man who ends up paying more attention to some friends he runs into the bar, you can feel her loneliness.  After ducking out of the wedding after the ceremony, missing his flight, and learning that he's about to be sacked, Harvey comes to drown his sorrows in an airport lounge and meets Kate (for the second time, it turns out).  Once they start trading barbed comments, you know this one is on a familiar romantic comedy track.  But what makes this movie work is the two principals:  Hoffman and Thompson are two Oscar-winners who are always a joy to watch, and together they make terrific chemistry.  As it happens, they first met when filming ""Stranger than Fiction"" a couple of years ago, and despite sharing only a scene or two in that film, they instantly clicked and became friends.  So they eagerly agreed to work on this project, only the second feature directed by writer/director Joel Hopkins.  The featurette on the DVD gives us some insight into their working relationship, and it turns out much of the chemistry is very real and some of the scenes were even improvised.  They capture perfectly the bond of two lonely and apparently different people, and the magic that a middle-aged romance can generate. (And how many good ""middle-aged romance"" comedies have you seen lately?)  They even transcend a plot twist straight out of ""An Affair to Remember"". The supporting cast is strong too, especially Atkins, Brolin, and Kathy Baker (playing Harvey's ex-wife). It doesn't hurt, either, that the film is beautifully shot in London, perhaps my favorite city in the world. I heartily recommend this film - it's a serviceable story, by turns funny and poignant, and buoyed by the excellent performances of its two main characters.",Last Chance Harvey

Her friends find out about it before she does (from a mancurist of all people) and they debate whether or not to tell her.  Mary (the one with the no-good, frog-faced, rougish, rat fink dog of a husband) finds out herself from the same mancurist and her Mom's advices her on what to do.  Mom suggests that she does nothing b/c if the husband really loved the girl, Mary would have felt it long ago and if she gets her friends involved then she'll just have another thing that she'll have to deal with.Mary finally confronts the other woman (Crystal) that's creeping around with her husband in a dressing room.  After Crystal obviously has no remorse about what she's doing, Mary confronts Steven (the rat) and says she wants a divorce.She gets the divorce in Reno but realizes too late that neither of them really want the divorce.  Steven feels that it is his duty to marry Crystal to protect what was left of her reputation.  (Yeah, I know, but men were a bit more chivalrous back then, which is pretty cool b/c nowadays some men leave ya with nothing more than a a kick in the teeth).Over a year passes and Mary still loves Steven and by now Steven can't stand Crystal.  Mary finds out that Crystal is cheating on Steven and devises a way to expose Crystal and get Steven back.  She does, the end.Fast forward to 2008 and what happens?!  A total disappointment!!  Okay, that wasn't completely accurate.  On its own I give it 1 1/4 out of 5 stars b/c the movie provide a few chuckles but as a modern day adaptation 1 1/2 and that's only because they did stay true to the plot for the most part.  I also give it props b/c it dealt with issues that women face today like the influence of the media on women's body images.  Good show for that.  But, even though it kept your attention (for me, it was mostly out of pure curiosity), it wasn't the laugh fest that I thought it would be.  Also, they wrote out my favorite character (Miriam Aarons) so it was all over for me.

The quality of these new toons is quickly surpassing almost all of the live action studio stuff being made, to the point where I'd rather watch one of these for sheer entertainment.The voices are good, the dialogue quite intelligent and rarely sappy, and overall this feels as much made for adults as kids. The phony agent/producer guy is a nice touch as well; no harm in letting kids know what kinds of weasels await in the ""grown-up"" world. Visually, Bolt is stunning; on blu-ray it's a trip. The myriad possibilites afforded by animation are well explored, especially wild ""camera"" angles that make watching this more mind-boggling than all but the best sci-fi and fantasy flicks. The hyper-cute animals make it a treat for kids and pet lovers alike, and the faux James Bond feel at the start and end is oddly thrilling. (I also like the promotion of choosing a rescue pet!

834048,"I became an instant fan of this intelligent ground-breaking sci-fi series from Paramount Television in its very first year on NBC. They didn't call the fans ""trekkies"" yet, but that was to come. And boy did it come!If I recall, what happened is that NBC made the huge mistake of cancelling the series due to what in their infinite wisdom they called ""low"" ratings.Well, let me tell you! That single dumb move by the programming department at NBC unleashed a fury that was unparalleled in the history of television at that time. Thousands of letters of protest were sent to NBC, and out of that fan fury the ""Trekkie"" was born.Eventually, the protests became too overwhelming to ignore any longer and the Star Trek series returned to the NBC schedule.

212663,"Contrary to popular opinion, The Search for Spock is just as good as The Wrath of Khan.  Like TWOK, The Search for Spock has an awesome villain.  The villain, Klingon Commander Kruge, is played by Christopher Lloyd.  With a villain played by Lloyd, you can't go wrong.  In my opinion, Christopher Lloyd played the best Klingon.  No other actor comes close to surpassing Lloyd's portrayal of a Klingon.The Genesis Device plot saved Star Trek.  In this movie, the Genesis Device was the perfect way to bring Spock from the dead.  The writers were very lucky to have it turn out this way.  As a result, the resurrection of Spock is very believable.  To steal a quote from Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, ""Genesis was perfectly named-- the creation of life, not death"".This movie works because it shows how much the crew risked to save Spock.  They disobeyed Starfleet by stealing the Enterprise and returning to the Genesis planet.  The movie clearly shows that the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many.",N/A
822501,"I liked the first Dirty Dancing movie, so when my husband raved about this one, I bought it instead of renting it first. It was a disappointment across the board, with just a couple of bright spots. The interaction between the girl and her father was touching. The acting by the two young stars was in character, but the script was not up to par and the rest of the actors were handicapped by the lines and situations they were required to deliver. It was shocking to see Patrick Swayze looking so old in this film. It didn't do him or the film justice. He would have been better off in a serious role rather than the bit player he was here.The scriptwriter tried to do too many things in this film and as a consequence, accomplished none of them. The acting, the dancing, and the overall production were disappointing, to say the least. None of it was credible. I cannot understand anyone getting excited by this film, but that's just me and my tastes. The first ""Dirty Dancing"" film drew me in and caused me to care about the characters and what happened to them.

618423,"Love, Christmas, London, EnglandRichard Curtis, the talented writer of the very successful Four Weddings and Funeral, Nottting Hill, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and one of Mr. Bean's the creators, wrote and directed Love Actually, and what a directing debut it is. The ultimate romantic dramedy, the film that is not ashamed to be sweet, heartwarming, and outrage romantic. Love Actually talks about love, romances, break-ups, moving on, and does it admirably. This is the film I can watch over and over - during Christmas time or spring time, or summer, and it always brings warmth, humor, laughs, sadness, and yes, Love that is everywhere, just look a little closer. This is the film that makes me smile and even brings the tears to my eyes - all at once. Love Actually gives romantic comedy its good name back. It is a very good movie - sometimes, close to perfect, gorgeous, sweet in the good sense of the word and always lovely.First, and foremost, I admire the film for outstanding (and I mean it) cast. Some of the best British and American and European actors (and there is also simply gorgeous Rodrigo Santoro who deserves a special mention) play twenty or even more Londoners who were hit by the Cupid's arrow during the Christmas season of 2003 in absolutely stunningly looking, lively and bright London. I won't be original if I say that the funniest character belongs to Bill Nighy as once super-famous rock star (in Keith Richard's type) who is making his comeback with an old love song that he is turning in the Christmas super hit. Another outstanding performance belongs to divine Emma Thompson. She brings depth and real emotions into her and Alan Rickman's story of the marriage in crisis. Laura Linney's story of love that was so close and possible but not meant to be was also very well told and acted.This time, Liam Neeson's story as a newly widower with the young step-son who is desperately in love with the most popular girl in school, touched me the most. After recent untimely tragic death of Neeson's wife, the mother of his two sons, Natasha Richardson, the story feels the most poignant and sweetest. The scene during Daniel's wife funeral, his speech celebrating Joanna's life, moved me almost to tears.Yes, it is a long movie and it tells the stories of 20 people or so who all happen to live, work, fell in love, sometimes have their hearts broke in London that I've never seen so bright and lovely as in this picture - perhaps, because the stories start five weeks prior to Christmas and end on Christmas night. With so many intertwining stories, not all of them are equally good. Some could be dropped, leaving the movie shorter, leaner, and perhaps better but even the way it is, Love Actually deserves its place on such top lists as Best of 2003, Favorites, and Favorite Romance. It is beautiful and magical - just like the season during which it takes place.",Love Actually

1190534,"When ""Milk"" came out in limited release, I had been looking forward to it for so long that I made sure I caught one of the very first screenings.  For a Wednesday morning before Thanksgiving, the theater was half full.  By the end of it, there was a symphony of sniffling and nose blowing.  I knew by then that it was one of my favorite films I'd seen in some time and I'm glad that it's now on DVD where I can watch (and sniffle) in my own home.There have been several very good biopics in the past several years such as ""Frida"" and ""La Vie en Rose."" Now we have ""Milk"" and it shines.  There has been some criticism of the story here, that it's very by-the-numbers, weak and not compelling.  I  must have seen a different film because I found the movie to be captivating from the casting, to period detail to Van Sant's directorial style which makes the movie feel like a 70s film, not just set in the 70s.  (Blending actual 70s footage with the movie was a good choice.)  Sure, some liberties have been taken but when haven't liberties been taken with biopics?  Milk lived 48 years; the film is two hours long.Sean Penn - justly awarded the Oscar for his work here- disappears into his role as the first openly gay man elected to public office, and it's the best performance I've seen him give.  I thought Penn was fine in ""Mystic River"" but the ""Is that my daughter in there?"" scene was a bit over the top but in ""Milk,"" Penn is restrained, humble and believable.  The rest of the cast is just as good, notably Josh Brolin as Dan White and Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones.  This film- despite Milk's fate- is uplifting and relevant.  I rarely give films a letter grade but ""Milk"" deserves an ""A.""",Milk
1239305,"The hype of this film prior to me even getting it in the store was higher than I had anticipated and I am actually having to order twice as many now. After playing it for screening audiences, word of mouth is making the demand even greater.The Amazon editorial delves plenty deep into all of the characteristics and relationships being played in this film and to what adequacy the acting appeared. I was thoroughly impressed with how everyone filled their roles to where both kids and adults would get something out of this. The visuals of fantasy and reality blurring together were done believably, and the resulting outlooks left with the viewer about adults in a kids world were moving and well written.Pullman was useless in the film as a father, but he played it perfect, as did Huffman in another obscure mother character role. Fanning proves she has a bright future with how she convinced both kids and adults what she was feeling and seeing in both worlds. The quality of the picture was adequate, and would be a solid case for HD with all of the colors used. The 5.1 gets used more often than one would think for a dialogue and fantasy film, but they stopped short with no special features of any kind.The two cover art DVDs are exactly the same except for the picture, no content or feature differences (both 100 minutes). For parents that are wondering about the rating, the PG13 does exist due to several gay themed words being used and a couple cuss words. Hope you enjoy.",Phoebe in Wonderland
1259303,"Anyone with any intelligence knows these flicks are usually guilty pleasures that hinge themselves on car culture: bad teens, fast cars, racing, chases, crashes, and hot chicks. These kind of flicks usually contain a few bubblegum elements, but this movie careens wildly off the guard rail with an implausible and overly serious storyline, a lot of terrible acting, not enough real car stunts, and the completely humorless execution of a bad script. There are absolutely no jokes, winks, or smiles in this dented wreck of a film. There is a short ROAD WARRIOR gag at the front of the flick. And, only one good racing scene utilizing real stunt drivers. That's it. The two rips thru the border tunnels are CG.Even though Lucas Black's performance was a serious affront to the profession of acting (Black played the kid in SLINGBLADE), at least TOKYO DRIFT had some great set pieces for the cars. The opening race thru the construction site, the drift race up the parking ramp, the chase thru Tokyo, and the final drift race down the mountain in that muscular Mustang, made it worth watching for all the car enthusiasts out there in TVLand.Wow! Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are so bad in this flick it's almost laughable. The cars in this flick have more personality than these two guys. They're both sleepwalking thru their performances. Diesel squints and displays only two emotions. 1. ""Don't mess with me, I'm concentrating on the road."" 2. ""Don't mess with me, I'm concentrating on revenge."" Which is really just the same emotion. Diesel seems like a nice enough guy, but let's face it, he doesn't possess a great range as an actor. Paul Walker is just... well, Paul Walker. Paint him lime green, slap some rims and vinyls on him, and he's good to go. I was really looking forward to seeing Michelle Rodriguez strut her stuff in this flick because I adore her. But, it seems that these cola commercial filmmakers found a way to remove her early from the festivities before I could finish undressing her with my eyes. (sigh) At least she won't have to embarass herself in another one of these movies. So, something good did come out of this flick.Two Stars (and that's being generous), because the look of the film is decent, there are some cars in it, and the music, though certainly cliche, is good. But, this flick is not even close to being a guilty pleasure. It's a junkyard dog!Even the Gag Reel is awful. And completely unfunny.If you're looking for a recent, and decent car action flick, you might want to rent Paul Anderson's remake, DEATH RACE.

447421,"Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) After part five was promised to be 'The Final Chapter,' Full Moon Entertainment promptly started promoting the return of their popular characters in the ""Puppet Wars"" series, which looked to be fairly ambitious in scope, at least if you believed the drawn-long-before-the-movie-was-made poster art. But once again, Full Moon's ideas were bigger than their bank account, so instead we get this extremely cheap and tedious hour and fourteen minutes.The 'story' has the puppets suddenly and mysteriously under the thumb of a maniacal scientist trying to use their secrets to construct a life size puppet/human hybrid. Why? I have no idea. In and around this, the scientist's daughter and slow witted handyman frolic. Of course, the young dimwit is targeted by the scientist as the perfect specimen for his experiments, thereby seriously jeopardizing the romance. Finally, waaaaayy into this stodgy soap opera, the scientist sends the puppets out to kill a couple of guys. Yawn. This is far and away the worst of the Puppet Master movies.  This one truly looks like it was shot over a weekend on a budget of about $10,000. It was directed by David DeCoteau, who also made the best of the series, part three. But apparently recognizing the handicaps he was working with here, DeCoteau wisely chose to throw one of his female pseudonyms on for the credits.My last round of long winded squawking about this movie is in regards to where it fits in the continuity of the series. (I don't know why I care about this, but I do.) It doesn't work as a continuation of part five, since that set up the idea of more adventures with their new puppet master. About the only place it fits is between parts two and four (since three was a WWII era flashback). That still leaves two untold stories--#1: what happened at the mental hospital they were heading to at the end of part two; and how that led them into the clutches of the evil doctor here. Then you somehow have to #2: get the puppets from this movie's nonsensical non-ending back to the Bodega Bay Inn for parts four and five.

1225598,"I happened to reach adolescence at the same time we moved to a virtually all Black pocket of poverty known as Marin City, CA.  There, I heard a type of music that immediately addicted me.  KDIA in Oakland, later KWBR broadcast an unending stream of genuine blues, R & B, and soul, not aimed at Whites, or caring what they thought.  Big Don Barksdale and Bouncin' Bill Doubleday held court, filling me with a love for the music that I have never lost  It was everywhere, in every home, every car, every place, and I couldn't get enough.  Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, John Lee Hooker, Sun House and all the all Delta Blues and Chicago Blues were my gods.  Not old enough, nor well-heeled enough for the club scene in SF, the radio was my connection that fed my addiction.  I knew all about the difficulty of life for those men and women as they struggled just to survive and make their music heard, and seethed with fury when slick White boys like the Beach Boys and Pat Boone started to steal the real music and get air play while my heroes were seldom heard.  I agree large parts of this movie are fictional, but the rough life and the hardship are not.  I believe racism will blight this movie, and it will never get the play it deserves, just as the ""race"" music didn't.  Yes, it is fictionalized, yes, it does leave out some great players, and yes, the music is not perfectly reproduced.  How could it be, considering the actors aren't the originals?  They do a pretty damn good job in my opinion.  They also have not had to live the abject poverty and open violence of the virulent discrimination of the times that informs the original men.  I think many of the Greats would be bemused to find that every great musician now pays tribute to their influence and true genius; I think even the incredible Keith Richards never fully understood why an angry and hostile Chuck Berry was so brusquely dismissive when he agreed to play with Keith.  If you weren't there, if you didn't live through it, no amount of book larnin' and movies are going to truly make you understand just how bad it was, and just how hard it was.

The husband, Tom (Lewis Fiander) hates crowds. He is the typical snobbish traveler who longs to be free of all other tourists. His wife Evelyn (Prunella Ransome) is several months pregnant, and would be happy basking in the sun and writing postcards to the two children she and Tom left at home. But she goes along with his side adventure to please him.All goes smoothly until Tom and Evelyn come ashore on the island of Almanzora. The village there is quaint, but the only people around at the moment are children. Tom, the stiff upper lip spouse, insists on a rational explanation: perhaps there's a fiesta in progress, on the far shore. Evelyn, the more intelligent of the two but prone to brief emotional outbursts for good reasons (like her condition and her brick-headed husband), suspects Tom of withholding crucial information from her. Above all, there is something noticeably not right about the children who alternately congregate and hide from their foreign visitors.Most of the film takes the form of a slow build, as Tom and Evelyn discover more and more evidence that Tom's rational explanation is far from the truth. A couple of violent incidents tip the scales, but Tom persists in denying what he sees.Unfortunately, the rest of the film (including its climax) is weakened by uneven acting. The stakes are not high enough, because we don't care about Tom and Evelyn, although the film's odd premise still offers a surprising degree of mystery and dramatic weight. And the cinematography is impressive for its time, and unusual for the horror genre.

62655,"I simply can't stand the CGI-animated films that have become a mainstream phenomenon for this new millennium. Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Shrek, Monsters Inc., and Ice Age were done extraordinarily well, but now CGI is everywhere and I think I'm going insane for even staring at one of their DVD covers! Much of them are just plain horrible (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Barnyard, Hoodwinked, Over the Hedge, Cars, Surf's Up, etc.), but most traditionally-animated films haven't fared well either (Home on the Range, Curious George, etc.). Are we going to have to sit through more of these in the future? I have a feeling that we most certainly will.Fortunately, we still have tons of 2D-animated classics that we can enjoy watching (in both DVD and Blu-Ray). The Lion King, Peter Pan, Fantasia, The Secret of NIMH, Treasure Planet, and many others still look beautiful and modern. These were made with great care, and most of them had solid scripts and memorable characters. One classic that really stands out is The Prince of Egypt. Created by Dreamworks, it tells the well-known story of Moses and his quest from God to free the Hebrews. Almost everything that you have read from the Bible are here: the burning bush, the ten plagues, the parting of the sea, and so forth. What really makes The Prince of Egypt so distinctive is that it's one of the few animated movies that actually takes its audience seriously. It has a slightly darker and much more serious tone, with images that would no doubt frighten little kids. There are still two comedic sidekicks that will certainly entertain the kids, but as a whole, the entire movie is just as mature as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. There hasn't been anything like this since it's been released back in 1998.What I love most about this movie is the animation. The 2D graphics are so beautiful and so detailed, that I literally couldn't help but sit there and stare at the awe-inspiring visuals. The water, the sand, the fires, the Ancient Egyptian architecture, everything is seen as top quality. There is one particular dream scene that's done in hieroglyphic form that looks pretty silly, but everything else is first-rate animation. The songs are very average (some of the weak links to this film). With the exception of the masterful ""When You Believe,"" they aren't very unforgettable. But the orchestral music by Hans Zimmer is quite spectacular. It amazes me every time I hear those North African motifs, and those echoing solos that are done by a soprano.I can't help but admire The Prince of Egypt. It's just as epic as The Lion King. It's a shame that we never get to see animated films like these today; all we get now are 3D-animated films that have flat characters, weak plots, and endless pop culture references. I can only hope that either Disney or Dreamworks (or whoever) can make a film that's provocative as this one.",The Prince of Egypt VHS

It's a final hurray for the 4-season long show that started out strong and ran into ""creative difficulties"" at the end. These two hours fill in a few gaps that the series finale glanced over. This is definitely a movie for the die-hard fans, as there are character reveals and returning characters as well as the regulars acting in a predictable manner. This is not a stand-alone film. Anyone who has not been a fan of the show, even anyone who has skipped most of season 4, will not really understand what is going on in the storyline and why the leads are worth rooting for. My recommendation is to watch the series finale up to the ""Four Years Later"" sequence, then seeing Prison Break: The Final Break, then returning to the season finale and watching the last few minutes (the montage at the end).

I've seen this interview before on the Bravo network on cable. I never knew it was on DVD. When Robin Williams is being interviewed, you know you will not be bored.  He had the audience in the theater laughing almost the entire time.  It's fun to hear his side when he's talking about his family, the movies he's made, his life growing up, the schooling he had before he went into the entertaiment buisness.  During the interview, he does a lot of stand-up.  It keeps the inverview fun.  The man is a comic genius!!  It's funny to know when he was in high school he was voted ""funniest person,"" but also voted ""least likely to succeed.""  So much they know!  Ha! I would recomend this dvd to anyone who is a Robin Williams fan, or even if you're not.  If you want a good laugh, he will keep you in stitches!",Robin Williams: Inside The Actors Studio

1246109,"There's sort of a stupidty meter with movies like this. There's smart funny, where the humor is good, well pointed, some kind of redeeming quality to them (Canadian Bacon,Wayne's World / Wayne's World 2, come to mind). Then there's the movies that are so bad, so offensive, that they are funny (Dude, Where's My Car?,National Lampoon's Van Wilder, for example). Then there's a whole bunch of movies in the middle, not hilarious, not stupid funny, but just kind of funny - well there's where we land with Fired Up. Middle of the road. There's funny moments, there's some pretty girls, and there's a funny plot.Two high school football players, who happen to be the school players, are tired of their prospects for chicks. They get the bright idea that cheerleader camp would be a place to score 300 new chicks, all in one place at one time. How cool is that? So they become cheerleaders and go to camp. They score. But really they fall in love with two cheerleaders, and they help the cheerleading squad out. And everyone lives happily ever after. It's that sweet.What's this unrated monkey business? The theatrical version was rated PG-13. Almost every bit of humor is related to sex in some way. So I have no idea how they dodged the R rating in theaters. At any rate, there is exactly one scene, the skinny dipping scene where a really gorgeous girl removes her swimsuit top (total time maybe 10 seconds), that puts this at R rating. Mind you it's a scene that should have been in the movie to start with, and there actually should have been many more of those kinds of scenes. Actually there's a fairly lame scene of two girls kissing, maybe the MPAA wouldn't have liked that. No there's no shower scenes, no raids in the middle of the night while the girls sleep...none of those things at all.Production wise - no idea why anyone would really care? It's very poorly shot. The editing is not good. The surround sound - virtually absent or the soundstage was totally flat and lifeless. There is absolutely nothing here that a television hack crew couldn't have accomplished in their sleep. But none of that makes a difference, this is a silly summer movie.Acting - virtually everyone is an unknown, relatively new actor, or deep on the B/C acting list. It was a little hard for me to beleive that these two dunder heads were that hot and popular with the women. They are OK, they are reasonably funny, but they weren't these amazing guys. The girls are pretty, no question there, well worth watching. Jokes are well delivered and hit punch lines about right.The bonus features are super lame. No they are down right awful. That 8 minutes of the cast saying the f word, just plain old and dumb. Nothing funny there. That 12th hour of the publicity tour - that was so scripted and lame. The blonde guy going off, totally a scripted and badly acted moment. No skip them completely, no reason to stop there. I think there are about 100 trailers for other films.Not a strong recommendation. Not a stinker. You know who you are that will enjoy this.",Fired Up!
1116695,"this was a wonderful show that unfortunately didn't find it's audience. Funny, charming, spectacularly original, well written and acted by a marvelous cast - it is gone too soon. It had such an original look to it that I had to have it on DVD. The only drawback is that this DVD only contains the first 8 episodes. The run was interrupted by the WGA strike and a handful of episodes were broadcast after it ended. There may even be a few more unaired - and it would have been better if ALL the episodes shot (even if unaired) had been put on a single DVD. Would have been worth the wait. Just in case, I decided I didn't want to miss a bird in the hand. The show is quirky and may not be for all tastes, but I can almost guarantee that if you watch the first - you'll be hooked. Kudos to all involved in this show and condolences on too short a run. Lee Pace, Anna Friel, Kristen Chenoweth, Swoosie Kurtz (and her eyepatch) and a hysterical Chi McBride - all deserved a far longer run in a witty, wonderful show.",Pushing Daisies:S1 (DVD)

1040136,"Benoit Magimel stars as Philippe in ""The Bridesmaid,"" a 2004 adaptation of the popular Ruth Rendell whodunit.  Philippe is a good-looking 20-something decorator who stills lives with family.  His father abandoned the family years earlier, and Philippe and his three sibs were raised by their mother, whom they adore.  At the wedding of his sister Sophie, Philippe finds himself attracted to one of the bridesmaids, the mysterious Senta (Laura Smet).  The two immediately fall into a torrid affair, and Philippe is shocked when Senta keeps raising the stakes.Director Claude Chabrol has directed many thrillers over the years, and ""The Bridesmaid"" is another efficient entry in his filmography.  Everything moves like clockwork in this icy film.  Magimel (""The Piano Teacher"") is superb as the repressed Philippe; his descent into Senta's world is totally believable.  I hadn't seen any of his work before, but I intend on seeking out some of his films now.  The plot twists aren't completely surprising, but the film is so skillfully made that the lack of shocks doesn't detract too much from one's overall enjoyment.  I'm a fan of cryptic French thrillers (e.g., Cache), and ""The Bridesmaid"" really hit the spot.",The Bridesmaid
315983,"This is a classic British comedy from the time when Alec Guiness, Michael Caine, Peter Sellers and other British comic actors (as differentiated from comedians) ruled the roost.The story is simple. Michael Caine is released from jail. A colleague of is murdered in Italy and his not-terribly-grieving widow brings Caine a message - on film, no less. The sight of Michael Caine sitting next to a film projector watching the outline of the planned heist is hilarious in this day of digital cameras and video iPods.The story involves Caine getting the permission and assistance of Mr. Bridger, a crime boss who leads a life of luxury behind the walls, recruiting a gang and making arrangements to steal a $ 4-million dollar gold shipment in Turin, Italy. (Four million sounds so small these days, doesn't it?)The story, frankly, is very thin. This is comedy, not drama. The real pleasure comes in the execution of the heist. A rogue ""computer expert"" (a hilarious Benny Hill doing his usual schtick) substitutes a tape - yes, a tape - at the traffic control center, which in turn sets off a massive traffic jam.The armored convoy carrying the gold is trapped in the midst of this jam and the rest of the film is occupied with the getaway. The getaway features a classic, very funny and very long car chase. Again, this is a comedy, not drama and almost cartoon-like . . . and great fun.The ending comes as a bit of a surprise and leaves the audience hanging, so to speak.All in all, a fun film.

1253743,"As someone with a large collection of fitness dvds, walking dvds can be either hit or miss. Some can be boring and redundant while others can bring in strangely complicated choreography for something called ""walking""...This hit the bullseye for energy and interest but it actually had a high caloric burn as well!CALORIE BURN: I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily calorie burn. Because of this, it also enables me to compare the calorie burn of all my workouts as to how many calories they burn not only during the workout, but per minute. I mention this only so that you know what I say is based upon measurement rather than perceived exertion...while there is no plyometrics and joint straining moves like ""mountain climbers"", she combines more simple moves with hand movements at a pace fast enough to ensure your heart stays in the target zone and the calories are revved. I didn't feel as though I was worn out, working as hard as when I do my intense aerobics, yet I have to say this burned a LOT of calories in whatever time span you choose to do it. That made it quite impressive because, especially if you've had some days of strength training, this is not hard on your muscles or joints, yet achieves just what it should.INSTRUCTOR: I couldn't put my finger on why I liked this instructor for the longest time and why she seemed different...I think the best analogy I can give is if you watch ""The Biggest Loser"" you see how the trainer Bob seems to not be ""acting"" for the camera or being anything but genuine, yet Jillian does. Often there seems to be some nervousness or ""over the top"" dialogue from trainers on dvds. Instead, this one seemed to be as though you were in a room with a friend who was showing you a routine she does. I can't quite put my finger on how to relay that...other than she seemed like she had done the routine a million times due to her comfort level, yet that she still loved it due to her energy. Often trainers fill up every empty second with words like ""that's it"" ""you've got it"" ""you remember this"" ""You are doing awesome"" etc...this one didn't seem to need to do that...she just spoke comfortably throughout with good reminders of how to do it right as well. Don't get me wrong, she still pushed you and encouraged you but didn't use the words just to fill an empty silence because of not thinking of anything else to say.SET: They kinda went all out for this video...It looks like an upscale studio. 12 foot letters spell out ""walk"" on the back wall, motivational words flash across the screen, there is a big blow up of the instructor with someone on the left wall, you see REAL cars outside a window so you know it's not a set, a clock counts down how far you have walked and lets you know when you have hit a mile or two. Very different. I wondered if she has her own upscale studio and does these routines in this place.MUSIC: Typically in workout dvds you have something made for the dvd that can be a little monotonous and all ""electronica"", but this was more like there was a dj putting on different tracks. Still background music, but it switched it up for interest and it kept it different and the pace of the music also increased as the pace of the steps did.MOVES: When I say this it sounds so boring but I have little attentioin span when I work out, no matter how often I do it, and this is one of the few that kept it up the whole time so I'm trying to get the best wording when I say that it's easy choreography (and when I say ""choreography"" do not think you'll be tripped up once...you won't.) with moves that are all variations of walking...kick backs, knee lifts, grapevine, etc etc with arm movements. You WILL be able to follow her. So much so that she says ""We don't tell you which leg you need to start with. It makes no difference. They both get worked out anyway"" and then she'll say something like ""kick backs"" and it truly doesn't matter which leg you start with.  Her moves are made so that you don't have to rewind to figure out how to ""put the steps together"" or worry about keeping it. Yet it's a true workout. She has really taken the best of routines and made it easy for all to do but still garner great results.WHAT YOU GET:A warm upA brisk 4-5 mph pace of moves that I found funMile Markers in the video celebrate when you've hit your mile mark of choice and allow you to keep going til you doCompound Muscle Movements ensure you hit more muscle groups than regular walkingCool Down WalkStretchbonus ""super sculpt the belly"" floor worktotal running time:53 minutesI think few dvds can take you from beginner to being someone who works out daily and still feel your needs but I think this one can and still keep your interest.If it's your only dvd, I would suggest adding another into your mix with some strength training or a circuit that has a combo of cardio and strength training in order to tighten and tone, but this will offer easy to follow fat burning.NEGATIVES: I wish that she had included more standing ab work rather than limiting it to a different section. This workout will help you lose ab fat and she discusses that often, but there are still some twisting moves that can be done while doing simple walking moves that could further tighten your core as well. This is a minor thing, but no dvd is perfect so I like to cover all bases that someone may look for.CONCLUSION: A good solid workout for any level. Enjoyable, good energy, perfect easy to follow cueing, good calorie burn",Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat

1168886,"Here's the short version of my review.* Buy it, it's fun and entertaining and Peppard is great as a self employed bounty hunter of missing or stolen highly-insured items.* His sexual behavior is reprehensible and meritless, but.. nobody's perfect.* It's fun to see if you can figure out these impossible thefts before Banacek does. The video is in good condition, not the highest quality, but good enough to be enjoyable.* Not only does he solve impossible thefts, he tells how it was done.  Banacek is probably on every magician's blacklist.Now, here's the longer version of my review;Until episode five, ( To Steal A King ) I didn't hear anyone mention Banacek's first name.  He typically only goes by his last name, even among his friends. Thomas Banacek is a private detective, sort of a suave mod seventies version of Sherlock Holmes in a turtleneck jersey, but with much less character background. George Peppard does an above average job of making the character entertaining to watch, but having more backfill to his past would have lent more scope to his character. Banacek is probably the opposite of Columbo, if you are familiar with that series. At first glance Banacek comes across as a gilded snobbish yuppie riding into the midst of crime scenes with an vein attitude in his personal limousine. But appearences are decieving. Banacek is not an antagonist and is never rude, quite the opposite he typically makes an effort to be polite and friendly to those around him without being pretentious or patronizing, and what people take for a super ego is simply a high level of confidence in himself. He has a refined sense of humor and always has a coy but snappy comeback when someone makes a crude or imptertinent remark. Mostly he's very easy-going and cool in his approach to his work and the people he enounters during his investigations, the only time he really seems to get perturbed is when someone remarks crudely on his Polish heritage or mispronounces his name, which happens a lot more frequently than it should.  Banacek limits his investigations to complex cases of thievery in which a highly valued object insured at great cost has gone missing under truly baffling circumstances. He attempts to recover the missing items or items, thus saving the insurer from having to pay, and and draws a commission of ten percent of what would have been paid out by the insurance company. Because of this, he often describes himself as being in the business of ""recovery"". He bristles at the idea of working for anyone but himself, and refuses to be ""hired"". High profile wealthy businessmen, politicians and private citizens who know of his reputation for success often ask thier insurance companies to bring Banacek into their cases. He shows up, makes an assessment of the situation, determines if it's worth his time to investigate. The friction in most episodes comes from other investigators who are direct employees of the insurance companies. They resent his presence because it bruises their egos and puts their own expertise into question. Banacek travels just about everywhere via his personal limousine driven by his chauffeur Jay who is loyal to Banacek but also adds comic relief to the episodes as he proffers his own rather strange ideas about how the crimes might have been perpetrated.  Apparently Banacek offered him an ongoing deal that if Jay could figure out how a crime was committed before he did, he would cut him in for ten percent of his ten percent commission. If there is anything controversial about the show it would be Banacek's overt womanizing. Early on, beginning in the first season there is more than enough innuendo in his various personal rendezvous with a new and different sexy female lead in each episode, that he has been running a string of one night stands.  Commitment in a relationship is not foremost on his list. Also , this is a show produced at the height of the woman's liberation movement, so women make plenty of references toward Banacek as a  ""male chauvinist"", which he definitely is not, though he might more aptly be defined as a male version of a nymphomaniac. On the other hand , the women he meets are not exactly reluctant to take a tour of his bedroom. I'm not sure if these episodes are shown in the orginal edited-for-television version, but I would say probably not. For example, in the pilot episode which is titled ""Detour To Nowhere"" at one point he is in a rented motel room where he has laid out some small peices of electronic equipment that he found in a shack, ( which later turned out to be a metal detector)... and is trying to figure out what they make and how they fit together.  A woman who shared his room the previous night and is still lying there in bed,( Carlie Kirkland a very attractive lady who works directly for the insurance company who is trying to recover the same missing armored car as he is ), coyly remarks , ""maybe it's a Polish vibrator"". I don't think that would have passed the network censors of the early 70's, so I suspect these are unedited or uncut. There are episodes which also show the racial conflicts of the time. Also in this series we see some of the early appearances of stars who will come into their own later. For example , Mike Farrell ( later played BJ Hunnicutt on M.A.S.H), appears in episode seven, he plays a significant role but does not get co-star rating in the show's credits. You might also recognize Garry Walberg as a police lieutenant in one episode, ( he later played the role of Lieutenant Frank Monahan on the Quincy M.E. series ).  Gregory Sierra stars as a co-culprit in one episode..., ( he had many different roles later including on twelve episodes of Sanford and Son, and 35 episodes of Barney Miller as Detective Chano Amenguale.)  Here are how the episodes basically play out.  A very mysterious robbery takes place that seems to be impossible. For example, at a casino a public display of one million dollars cash under a sealed glass dome suddenly ends up empty right in front of everyone's eyes. In comes Banacek.  Whoever the company insurance investigator is, resents him,and lets him know it. Banacek looks around, asks some questions, calls his friend Mulholland who is a cultured erudite bookworm with an unparalleled knowledge of history to look up some information for him, talks a beautiful woman into a late night meeting, figures out the how the crime was done and then... either confronts the perp directly ( which is not always a good move for Banacek since he doesn't carry a gun and confronting the crook sometimes ends up in a violent struggle), or gets together with the victim and the insurance rep and fills them in on how it was done and where the object is located. It's rather formulaic, but it works.  It's entertaining and fun to see how the crimes were committed. That's basically where the most enjoyment comes from , seeing how the impossible crime was actually pulled off. There is also lots of great Boston scenery, if you happen to be from New England and are familiar with Boston you'll recognize many of the landmarks, maybe even some of the street signs.  It looks like they used real footage of the outdoor Boston area rather than a set, and of course the opening credits of each episode when he is rowing on the Charles River.  It's a short lived series, only Two seasons, but they are entertaining enough to own as a collection and simply to enjoy watching.  As for the video quality, it's okay.  Not the best ever, but about equal to what it probably looked like when it was broadcast on television during the 70's. Very watchable , the sound is good. I encountered no problems with viewing or listening to the DVD's.- Mike S.",Banacek: The Complete Series

165256,"This is one of my favorite all time films.  About 10 years ago I decided to watch all films of the AFI 100 years 100 movies. That was the only reason I grabbed this off of the shelf.  This movie is one of the rare films that gets better every single time you watch it.  The dialogue is crisp and fantastic.  I have a digital copy on my Zune and have LISTENED to this film a dozen times while on road trips.  I just slap on my headphones and listen, laugh and quote dialogue to myself.  My wife thinks I am crazy.This is the story of one maniacal Air Force general who authorizes his planes to nuke the Soviet Union. After he gives the go code, and refuses to call them back, the rest of the film follows 3 groups of people, the general and his RAF counterpart holed up in the office on the base.  The army is trying to get to the general to get the recall code.  The RAF commander is trying to get the insane general to give in. We also have the B52 bomber flown by Major Kong on its way to deliver the payload (Kong is the one from the iconic image of the pilot riding the nuke as it plummets) and my favorite arena, the Pentagon.  At the pentagon we have the President and his closest advisers, including Buck Turgidson and the titular Dr Strangelove. George C Scott as Turgidson is phenomenal.  His facial expressions, mannerisms, and overall insanity play perfectly in this nuclear satire.  While Strangelove is the ex nazi scientist who is helping America to win the cold war.There are so many fantastic parts, lines, innuendos, and visuals in this film, it would take too long to mention them all.  Just please, watch the film.On the DVD you can see inside the mind of the 1960's Hollywood marketing team.  The Trailer is awkward at best.  What was nice was the ""interviews"".  IN the 60's they used to tape answers to questions from the cast for a split screen interview. Then they would have their local entertainment reporter ""ask"" the questions and it woudl look like Peter Sellers was talking to your hometown guy.T","Dr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"
655071,"Despite its intensely passionate story, the film, itself, was a notch above boring.  It moved slowly, its momentum ebbing in several places, followed by rapid catch up.  While lovely to watch, what was noteable about the film was that Albert Finney stole it.  His John Newton was brilliant, as was Romola Garai's Barbara Spooner.  The story of Wilberforce was compelling and educational, but those endearments were largely extrapolated and not inherent in the film, itself.",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

1070557,"In the interest of full dislosure, before you invest your time reading my review, know this: I couldn't get through the whole film. Why? The animation gave me a serious headache.I'll refrain from commenting on the substance of the story, but, stylistically, ""Renaissance"" combines the worst visual elements of CGI, rotoscope, and black-and-white. While it seems to strive for the intense, graphic-novel-inspired asthetics of ""Sin City"" and ""300"" (both great-looking films, in my opinion), the visual storytelling in ""Renaissance"" is too dark (literally), too hard to follow, and the constant flipping between what's black and what's white, what's positive and what's negative, made my corneas throb.In short, I was disappointed. I love artfully done, ""grown up"" animation, and the plot description and trailer really caught my attention. Plus, I hate not finishing a movie, even an absolutely awful one. ""Renaissance"" is not absolutely awful, but my eyes just couldn't take 105 minutes of it.",N/A
1252346,"Finally, one of television's most beloved sitcoms from the 1960s is being released on DVD. After Lucille Ball's immensely popular 1950s program, I Love Lucy went off the air, she returned with The Lucy Show. This time around, Ball plays Lucy Carmichael, a widow raising two children -a daughter named Chris (Candy Moore) and a son named Jerry (Jimmy Garrett). Ball's long-time friend Vivian Vance, also of I Love Lucy fame, plays Vivian, a recently divorced woman who moves in with Lucy. Vivian is raising one son, Sherman (Ralph Hart) . The show follows the comedic, everyday mishaps of Lucy and Vivian as they work to raise their children alone, manage a household, live without men in their lives, and deal with personal issues, such as finding Mr. Right.Ball knew it would a be gamble returning to television without Desi Arnaz, since the pair had long been identified as an iconic American television couple. But Arnaz and Ball were now divorced, and having them star in a new television series was impossible. Despite this, The Lucy Show went on for six seasons and, like I Love Lucy, did not drop out of the Nielsen top ten rankings once.It's easy to tell why. Ball is a highly talented comedian and actress, while Vance is a perfect second-in-command. These two ladies play comedy perfectly off one another. It feels completely natural, and every episode of The Lucy Show is brimming with their creative, physical comedy, which will have everyone rolling on the floor.One of the best episodes of the series, ""Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower"" features an absolutely hilarious scene in which the two women get stuck in a dangerous shower after the water won't turn off. The scenario may be completely improbable, but Ball and Vance float through the dialogue with such ease that the viewers forget any sense of real danger, going along for the laughs.Even modern viewers will be able to relate to the humor here; the show still works although some of the issues are a quite dated. In ""Lucy and Viv Put in a TV Antenna"" Lucy and Vivian go to extreme measures to install a new TV antenna on the roof of their home. This episode is hilarious, even to most modern viewers, who have mostly known only cable and satellite and have never needed to bother with an old-fashioned antenna. The writing is dead on, and the performances are perfect.All 30 first-season episodes gathered in this set are beautifully restored in the original black and white, although the series would later convert to color.This DVD set is packed with special features including two brand new interviews with actors Lucie Arnaz and Jimmy Garrett, the original network sponsor openings and closings, original promos and commercials for the show, cast biographies, production notes, a clip of Lucille Ball introducing her new show, a segment on vintage Lucy merchandise, and more. In addition, all episodes in this set are completely unedited; each episode is featured in its entirety. There's even a really neat feature that plays the original episodes, complete with the network openings, closings, and cast commercials, allowing viewers to experience The Lucy Show much like when it first aired on television.While not quite as good as I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show is a great extension of that series, filled with the sort of over-the-top physical comedy that Ball fans loved.",The Lucy Show: The Official First Season

1180430,"I love Puccini's music in this opera--what he writes for the voices and for the orchestra.  I'm also a big fan of the Met's video productions of their many operas; not just the ones done recently in high definition, but those done on video tape since the 1980s at least.  They are well-directed;  thank you, Brian Large, director of this one.Overall, I enjoyed Karita Mattila in this production; I thought her acting was absolutely right for what is, after all, a stage production (not a film).  Her voice isn't perfect at every moment, but she won me over.I find tenor Marcello Giordani uneven, based on a couple of performances I've attended and when I've heard him on the radio, and in this video;  I mean this re: his voice and his acting.  I find it a bit painful to watch and listen to him.  I agree with another reviewer, though, that he is better in the final acts than in the first two.",Puccini - Manon Lescaut

I had no idea what to expect with Little Dorrit, since I'd never read the book and I didn't have any idea what the story was about.  The length was daunting, and for that reason I almost didn't watch it.  But I'm sure glad I did, as it turned out to be one of my favourites (along with the new version of Oliver Twist).The cast, costumes, and look of the film were all wonderful.

733940,"The most distracting thing about this dvd set is the audience over-laughter on every single little thing Bean does. It becomes highly annoying. Every thing Bean does results in almost a standing ovation from the audience. You can hear this audience coughing, breathing, and waiting on his every move to burst out in the loudest laughter over things that should NOT be funny. Mr. Bean is very funny to me but everything is funny to this audience. There's not more than a few seconds between roaring laughter. The volume of the audience is also so loud that it dominates each show and becomes the focal point. Each show is out on location somewhere and not filmed in a studio so this laugh track must have been inserted over each show. I would much rather see Bean the movie where I can enjoy watching him in peace. The audience over-laughter ruins the tv show for me.",Mr. Bean - The Whole Bean
1153925,"I had heard that this was a creative and unpolished roadtrip movie, and given the subject matter of star wars fanboyism, I just had to see for myself. From the first few minutes I found my hopes a little deflated by the bad acting, cliche' screen play writing, and farce-laden comedy that seemed out of place with the film's obvious attempt to build a real story around real characters for which I was expected to invest some level of emotional involvement. That deflated enthusiasm was never restored, and continued to errode as the movie wore on. The characters (and their ""issues"") were cardboard cut-outs with predictable over-reactions, arguments, and the like. The plot movement felt more like a shakey waggon with loosely tied luggage falling off at every bump than the solid, streamlined plot development of a well done movie. There were a few moments that were well done and enjoyable, but they were like dull jewels that seemed to get swept under the rug by another offense by the time you had dusted them off well enough to enjoy the glow. The counterpart to this film that 'did it right' would be ""High Fidelity"" which mastered the art of depicting fanboys in their element of geekdom while at the same time painting a genuine story with believable characters. Ditto with Galaxy Quest (which is coming to Blu-ray at long last). Watch either High Fidelity or Galaxy Quest if you'd like to watch this concept set to film the right way. Or rent this film but be prepared to be let down if your expectations are for a ""good movie"".",Fanboys
713059,For the record I only bought this two movie set because I liked American Ninja 2. I really didn't want part three and I will reveal why later on. The American Ninja series is a guilty pleasure series at best. I like parts 1 and 2 for what they were: action flicks to pass the time. If you look at it that way then American Ninja served its purpose.American Ninja 2:The Confrontation. Rating 4 stars.AN2 is the best sequel in the American Ninja series. The story detail the naval officers are kidnapped and its up to Joe to find out who is doing the kidnapping and stop them. Joe later on bumps into a plan involving genetically enhanced ninjas.AN2 has some pretty cool fight sequences but my favorite scenes are the bar fight and the final showdown with the so-called super-ninjas. Michael Dudikoff is stiff as usual Steve James is a hoot as always. But I still have fond memories of this movie regardless. It was a good follow up to American Ninja and after seeing the other sequels its the best sequel period.American Ninja 3: Blood Hunt. Rating 1 star.As a sequel I hate AN3 with a passion. This movie is soulless to a fault. Michael Dudikoff is replaced by someone even more wooden than he is(Michael Bradley) and the results are disastrous. Even Steve James looks like he doesnt want to be here.The story is about David Bradley's character joining a martial arts tournament. He later finds the guy that kills his father is planning to unleash a biological weapon and plans to stop him.AN3 is boring as hell and that was a big no-no back in the 80s. B-movies had to be fun or they would have no audience. The makers of this weak link didnt seem to grasp that concept. Even the action scenes(which are the bread and butter of the American Ninja series) are weak and repetitive. Steve James is not his normal scenery-chewing self. He spends most of the movie looking like he's bored out of his mind. Everything that made the first two enjoyable for what they were are absent in this movie. Two thumbs down.Conclusion: 1 good sequel and 1 weak sequel. If you liked American Ninja 2 you will have no choice but to get this two movie set. Unless you want the VHS you have no choice but to settle for this deal. I'm okay with it because I can still watch AN2 and disregard part three.,N/A
519309,"Visconti was widely praised for both the realism and vaguely politicized tone of his early films, and the operatic sumptuousness of his later historical costume dramas... Throughout his career, however, style dominated content; all too often, the result was a decorative melodrama disguised as solemn, socially significant art...Adapted from an internationally popular novel by Giuseppe Tomassi di Lampedusa, it was termed a masterpiece by some and a bore by others... Certainly, it was deliberately paced, with minute attention given to period detail...A prime example is Visconti's climactic and grandiose ballroom sequence, which seems to fill one-third of the film... But the director presented the charm and manners of a bygone era so masterfully... ""The Leopard"" saw a return to a long, lushly historical drama, observing an aristocratic family's reluctant but inevitable acquiescence to a son's romance with a middle-class girl, set against the backdrop of Garibaldi's unification of Italy...",The Leopard

578818,"If you were to define the term `passion project' you might want to use a film like `September'.  Woody Allen was so `passionate' about this film that he shot it more than once, rewrote it during the shoot, recast the film multiple times, tore it apart after editing and was keen on doing it all over again.  The finished piece we are left with is cohesive and genuine and `hopefully' what Allen was looking for.I should say this first off; this is unlike your usual Allen fare so be forewarned.  It is much more personal and intimate and draws comparisons to Bergman's work (who apparently is a big influential director for Allen).  It feels so far removed from Allen's work that I would have never known it really was part of his filmography had I not looked it up.Just thought you should know that.The film takes place in one large home over a weekend while a middle-aged woman deals with her love interest in he neighbor as well as her distanced relationship with her attention hungry mother.  I think the description for the film I read simply stated `Howard is in love with Lane but Lane is in love with Peter but Peter is in love with Stephanie' but it is so much more than that.  The film reflects the quiet emotional balance between characters, allowing the house itself to almost take over in scenes as the characters converse in stilted whispers.  Occasional outbursts of disgruntled chaos add layers of emotional relevancy to the otherwise docile proceedings.  It's a very small, very quiet, very simple film, but it's within the simplicity that it excels.The acting is all spot on, especially from the women.  Mia Farrow (Allen's muse at the time) really captured her characters quiet desperation, allowing just enough of her uneasy nature to brim to her surface.  Elaine Stritch is hilarious as Lane's intrusive mother Diane.  The way she handles her characters self absorption is incredible.  She's biting throughout.  Dianne Wiest, a favorite of mine, continues to prove why she is seriously one of the best supporting actresses of all time.  She flows effortlessly through this film, creating a character we want to know more of.  The men here are fine bedfellows, but they cannot match the intrigue provided by their female counterparts.My only complaint with the film is the script, which I felt was a little unfinished.  I wasn't very interested in the subplot concerning Diane and her ex-boyfriend's murder or whatever.  I know it was partially based on fact and it does offer us a segway into more meaty matters between mother and daughter, but I found that it felt rather forced, and that was a shame because the film otherwise feels very relaxed and genuine.I still highly recommend this one though, for it is a different side of Woody and it serves as a nice character study; a true testament to relationships and self acceptance.",September
1047156,"Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who makes art out of the least ""artful"" objects imaginable.  Everyday items such as crates, boxes, metal containers, etc. - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d`art by Burtynsky`s camera.  He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them, that is.  Even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through Burtynsky's lens (but didn`t we already know that from ""Wall-E""?).  He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures (i.e. the workers in those places), with their uniform clothing and robotic movements, become part of the industrial landscape.""Manufactured Landscapes,"" a documentary about Burtynsky's work, has much of the feel of a ""Koyaanisqatsi"" about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns.  Indeed, director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms, as their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China, a dockyard in Bangladesh, and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China.  With their fluid camerawork, the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of Burtynsky's images.  In fact, the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows.The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the ""themes"" of his work, which, quite frankly, come out sounding confused, contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best.  But it is as a purely aesthetic experience, highlighting image and form, that ""Manufactured Landscapes"" resonates most.  In the case of Burtynsky, perhaps, a picture really IS worth a thousand words.",Manufactured Landscapes

1239491,"Last Exile is one of those anime series that's been floating around for a few years now that I repeatedly made mental notes of considering while shopping.  With commercials and trailers that hinted to some kind of early-avionics days adventure, it looked interesting enough but always seemed to get passed by for some flashy-boxed mecha OVA or gritty, modern-day set series.  Now that Funimation has picked up the Geneon property in its entirety, my days of putting off Last Exile have finally come to an end and let me just start by saying I should not have wasted so much time getting into this anime gem.  But before I get too far ahead of myself, let's take a moment to discuss the packaging and physical presentation.Last Exile the Complete Series consists of 26 episodes across 4 discs and comes packaged in a stylish cardboard slipcase containing a pair of thin packs.  The artwork is stunningly appropriate, with a purposely-weathered look that includes the yellowing of the parchment and near-black & white quality to the portraits.  Faded images of the pilots, decked out in their antiquated flight gear, standing proudly before their weathered open-cockpit aircraft have a look about them that just nails the look and feel of the early 1900s.Coming in at a total runtime of 625 minutes, Last Exile wears a very conservative TV14 rating.  This is nearly general audience material with a slight hint of adult undertones (war and aerial combat) but the show contains no real violence, suggestive content, or foul language worth parental concern.  Like real wars, some characters (even beloved by the end) do lose their lives to the cause.  However, Last Exile is never graphic in its portrayal of death nor does it glorify themes of violence.Language options are solid with the original Japanese dialog perfectly preserved (English subtitle option) and an English dub that can truly be called worthy of the incredible scope presented within.Last Exile is the product of the revered Gonzo Studios and made its broadcast debut over Japanese airwaves back in 2003.  I mentioned earlier that the artwork (and show itself) go a long way to accurately portray what we consider the early days of humanity's aviation experience (think barnstormers from The Golden Age (1918-1939)), however the events presented take place entirely in a fictitious world called Prester and while the culture habiting this world appears nearly identical to that of our own early 1900s, there is more to the story than what initially appears.The planet's surface-dwellers are basically divided into two factions:  The Anatoray and the Disith.  The Anatoray most closely resemble our definition of modern society (so much so in fact that our main two protagonists happen to be members of this group) while the Disith, though similar, are a bit more primitive in nature (think fighting with spears and shields).However the two feuding nations quickly discover that they share a common bigger threat in the form of the vastly technologically superior elf-like alien race orbiting the planet known as the Guild.  Separating the aliens' massive battleships from the people living below is a patch of never-ending nasty weather called the Grand Stream.  I should also mention that it is this violent storm that keeps the surface-dwellers living in perpetual darkness with the minimal of natural resources (including clean water).The core of the story is told from the perspective of a pair of orphaned teenagers who make a living as courriers from the cockpit of their deceased fathers' beat-up vanship (this would be the equivalent to our old biplanes).  However gasoline engines and massive wings to create lift are foregone in this world in favor of a concept called the Claudia engine, which somehow operates on a system of pressurized blue-glowing fluid.The story really picks up when our appropriately likable duo (Claus and Lavi) end up taking on a mission to deliver a little girl named Alvis to the captain of a warship called the Silvana.Fans of my reviews may have noticed that I strive to not give away too much of the plot in my critiques because, after all, if you already know the entire story, what's the purpose of bothering with the show?  Instead I like to draw comparisons to other works to establish a sense of what makes the series worth viewing.  That said, Last Exile could best be described as a blend of Star Wars, a Tom Clancy novel, and maybe even a slight touch of cultural intricacy found in Star Trek.  Now I realize that sounds like a lot of space-movie comparisons but make no mistake, Last Exile borrows only from the better traits of these titles.  There are moments of vanship racing that really ring of the pod race sequence in Episode One, The Phantom Menace.  There is no shortage of military strategizing on an absolute grand (and quite flawless) scope throughout.  There's a bit of romance and comedy spread across an absolutely massive cast that is surprisingly easy to keep separate.Pacing is just spectacular once you establish the slightly slow-going rhythm of the first few episodes.  However the show's greatest strength lies in its presentation:  Subtleties such as lighting and sounds are consistent and often subliminally establish mood more effectively than many big-budget Hollywood feature films.Gonzo's reputation as being one of the premiere anime studios comes through in this work in the form of flawless shifting of scale throughout the story arc.  In other words, the story starts out a small, personal tale of a pair of children struggling to find their place in the world, expands to portray an unthinkably massive war for survival between a planet and its invaders, then tightens to become a personal affair in the end.  There is an air of confidence in Gonzo's pacing and presentation that simply invites viewers to let go and trust in their ability to tell their tale and in this case, that faith pays dividends.Last Exile is a simply stunning anime work that starts to reveal its charm visually but continues to dazzle by doing nearly everything right; pacing, scope, sound work, story depth, science integration, nail biting action, lovable cast, it's all here and done to perfection as only a seasoned studio like Gonzo could pull off.This is must-see anime in the purest sense of the concept and kudos to Funimation for refusing to allow such a well-constructed title to slip through the cracks.",Last Exile: The Complete Series

1159093,"Ron Howard's ""Frost/ Nixon"" is an account of the televised interviews that David Frost, the British talk show host, conducted with the disgraced former President of the United States in the summer of 1977.  Howard follows the negotiations and jockeying for position by each side before an agreement was reached to go forward with the program.  Nixon was represented by the legendary agent, Swifty Lazar, who held out for the best deal that he could get.  Both Frost and Nixon had a great deal to lose.  Frost's entire reputation was on the line.  Would he prove to be a lightweight, someone easily manipulated by a wily political veteran?  Would Nixon stonewall or would he allow the cracks to show, revealing the person underneath the mask?Using Peter Morgan's screenplay, Howard does a creditable job of recreating the excitement that accompanied this unprecedented television event.  Frost and Nixon each had his team of avid supporters.  Kevin Bacon plays Jack Brennan, Nixon's former military aide and champion, with steely-eyed determination.  Sam Rockwell is the highly strung James Reston, Jr., who despises Nixon and wants Frost to go for the jugular.  Reston will not be satisfied with anything less than an admission of guilt by the former Commander-in-Chief.Frank Langella steals the movie, hands down, with his outstanding and touching portrayal of a flawed and insecure man whose accomplishments were undermined by his penchant for combativeness and self-destructiveness.  Langella shows Nixon in a variety of moods: drunk and self-pitying, fierce and aggressive, and finally, resigned and introspective.  Unfortunately, Michael Sheen fails to capture David Frost's keen intelligence.  Too much emphasis is placed on Frost's penchant for squiring gorgeous women around, reducing this Cambridge graduate to little more than a shallow television personality with a bright idea.  Only when Frost realizes that Nixon has the upper hand does he decide to buckle down and nail Nixon with a series of hard-hitting questions.Howard may be trying to convey a broader message about the ways in which the ""imperial presidency"" clashes with its natural adversaries, the insatiable reporters who will do anything to get at the truth.  The film drags at times and breaks little new ground in telling a story that many of us remember quite well.  The reason to see ""Frost/Nixon"" is to enjoy Langella's nuanced depiction of a complex individual that few people ever completely understood.",Frost/Nixon Theatrical Release

12836,"Every 7-10 years, there's a teen comedy that might not be particularly brilliant but is very enjoyable and works just a little harder at winning your affection. The characters are slightly more real than their stereotypes even if the storyline is pretty standard. It makes you wish that the lazy screenwriters of other high school movies would actually put in the same miniscule effort. Usually you know which movie it is by the fact that you know many of the actors from later material. In the early 80s, the movie wasFast Times at Ridgemont High (Widescreen Special Edition)(which the AV Club has called Hollywood's Yearbook). In the early 90s, it wasDazed & Confused (Widescreen Flashback Edition)and in 1998, it was this one.Even though the characters are very standard - the white kid that acts black, the serious girl, the teen queen, the evil jock, the nerd, the stoner (although the unfortunate decision to make this PG-13 ran up against the draconian MPAA's iron fist so the stoners must pretend otherwise as if this is the Golden Age of Censorship) - the actors playing them get more leverage out of them and the script lets them be more than their roles. Peter Farinelli's evil jock character is capable of sweetness if only when wasted. Charlie Korsmo as the nerd that loosens up is almost believeable as both the nerd and the nerd that everyone wants to make out with. Seth Green broke out of his Buffy rut and went all out for a character that could have been just a joke. The main character wanting to get with Jennifer Love Hewitt is boring, but when has the main plot in these ensemble teen movies ever been fun? (Was there even a main plot in Dazed & COnfused? I think the football player refusing to sign the drug statement counts)And what's even more fun from the 10 year anniversary perspective is the presence of actors that you know and like in supporting roles. You get Amber Benson as banana girl, Jason Siegal lovingly eating a watermelon (and 11 years later that seems to be his main acting choice onHow I Met Your Mother: Season Four- but it's still funny) and Donald Faison as the drummer that wants to wear the cowboy hat.The original commentary track is pretty standard (Seth Green's fake British accent is annoying and I'm happy that they stop it 15 minutes in) but the 10 year anniversary track is one of those drinking commentary tracks that people just love. And it's completely appropriate and worth the price.All in all, this is one of those movies that's consistently enjoyable. Not too deep but invested enough in its characters to overcome the cliches of the genre. And the 10 year commentary puts everything into perspective, as this is the movie that makes viewers feel like they are coming back home to see old friends.",N/A

1229335,"Paul Rudd is cute and hilarious. He plays a sweetheart of a fiance looking for a best man/best friend. I loved the first dinner man-date, and the kiss at the end of it was so funny. Peter Segel is great as Sydney...I'm starting to like him more with each movie he does. He was fantastic in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Rashida Jones was a delight to see on the big screen, too. I think she and Paul Rudd had excellent chemistry, and I think it's sweet that her character wanted her fiance to have guy friends. I'm glad Jones is doing movies now, and I'm looking forward to seeing her in a new season of Parks and Recreation.This movie is hilarious, but it does have a little of The 40-Year Old Virgin vibe going on...maybe it was all the curse words, but it was not gross like that movie was in some parts. I recommend this for good laughs. It's definitely worth a rental at the very least.",N/A
1218242,"I can't comment on the subtitles, as I did not watch the original theatrical version of this film. Unless I happened to view the updated version with theatrical subtitles without knowing it, but I didn't see anything particularly flawed with them. There were some odd spots that, if I had the flawed version, may have been better explained in the theatrical subtitles, but the story worked for me.I didn't know how long Eli had been ""alive,"" but a synopses of the film at IMDB explains that she/he was 200 years old. I don't recall learning that fact during the movie itself. That, and a few other odd bits aside, Let The Right One In was very different and entertaining.You can gather what the film is about by reading any detailed review, or plot synopsis, but what you won't learn is how unpredictable, bizarre, and dynamic is turns out to be. In fact, what made this more unpredictable for me is not knowing what it was about before I saw it. Somehow my brain ignored the word ""vampire"" on the cover, and I had a very different notion in my head about what I should expect. That worked in my benefit, because I learned what the film was about as it unfolded. When the subject matter of a film is not readily apparent the audience won't really know what to expect.It was dynamic in the sense that the slower parts were well balanced with periods of intense action, horror and scares, but there wasn't a consistent rhythm. That is handy if you want to keep people guessing, and unprepared, but it can make those slower, dramatic parts seem too slow, or unwelcomed at the time.The atmosphere was great. Creepy locations, and a wintertime setting worked well. Excellent framing and camera work help tell the story and keep the viewer interested. A few minor sub plots give us a little more to be interested in, and blend well with the main theme.I would watch this one again. It's a great film with enough gore, blood and neck shredding for any horror fan, but enough art to make it an intriguing art film.",N/A

373809,"This 1994 Disney movie and the much older version starring Sabu (first filmed and released to old fashioned movie theaters in 1942) are both excellent movie adaptations of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book. A better version plays in my mind when I read Kipling's collection of short stories, complete with three dimensional living color and infinite point one surround sound, but there is a bit of a problem with putting it on a dvd and selling it to you. Until that problem is solved, you'll have to make do with what's currently available on dvd and a new Jungle Book movie now being made by the BBC, due out in 2010. Did I say make do? HA! Until the dvd that I recently ordered from Amazon UK arrives, I can only tell you about the Jungle Book I saw on tv. The colors were breathtakingly vibrant for standard definition tv, the sound was engaging (on my home theater system), the story was the sort of rip roaring adventure that Kipling wrote so well and not one single human or other animal decided to start singing. Yea! The animals all looked like wild animals in a jungle, which isn't always the case with jungle flicks. Well, except for the big snake. It looked more like rubber. But you don't see it for long. Ladies and gays will love seeing young, handsome, muscular Jason Scott Lee in a loin cloth as Mowgli, the jungle boy, now a man. I believe he was 27 or 28 when he made this flick, but he looks younger. Cary Elwes (main hero of Princess Bride and Robin Hood: Men in Tights, director of two episodes of Pinky and the Brain) made a wonderfully evil villain. The talented and beautiful Lena Headey (star of Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles) is Mowgli's young love interest. Multi-talented John Cleese (Basil in Faulty Towers, Nearly Headless Nick in the Harry Potter movies) makes a great slightly befuddled professor. Sam Neil(Dr Alan Grant in Jurassic Park #1 & #3) makes a very good, rather stuffy British army colonel and father. I was so impressed by what I saw on tv that I just had to order it. There were two choices for getting it on dvd: pay a rip-off price at Amazon USA or buy it for about twenty bucks from Amazon UK, counting the exchange rate and shipping. Of course, it would be a region 2 PAL dvd. No problem, I bought a JVC all region dvd player with a built in PAL to NTSC converter 5 or 6 years ago to play PAL box sets of the oldest and best sitcom in the world: Last of the Summer Wine. (Well, I did have a sort of a dvd player that kind of did the job before that, but I'd rather not talk about it. Never buy a brand name you've never heard of, especially if it sounds like a cat sneezing.) Strange as it seems to me, some people don't care for Last of the Summer Wine. No accounting for taste. There are many tv shows and movies either only available in England or cheaper there. Can you find enough of them to make buying a special player worthwhile? If so, search Amazon and/or the web for ""PAL dvd player"" or ""code free dvd player"" or 'all region dvd player"". If you download the Web Of Trust and do a google search for code free dvd player sellers , you can check out the seller without even going to the website. At the website, a Better Business Bureau logo is always reassuring. Read the return policy carefully. Make sure the player you choose can convert PAL to NTSC. Some require an expensive separate converter. Buy a major brand name, not a cat sneeze brand. If that all seems like too much trouble, the cheapest used Jungle Book dvd on Amazon USA is fifty bucks counting shipping (as of 3/27/09). It's a wonderful movie but I'm not sure if it's worth that much. Then again, maybe it is. I'll add an update as soon as I've watched my PAL dvd a few times. In the meantime, why don't you check out Amazon UK to see if you can find any other good  movies or tv shows that are unavailable or more expensive here. Look up your favorite actors (of either gender) at the Internet Movie DataBase, then click on ""shop at Amazon"" on the left near the top. The page you're taken to will list all the actor's movies available or once available on dvd, and give you links to them on Amazon and Amazon UK. I just got an email that my movie is already in the mail and on it's way to me.

No, not Heathcliff - although it would be nice to see him in 3-D for a spell - I'm talkin' 'bout Garfield, the popular comic strip by the great Jim Davis.It's just another day at work for Garfield.  And by work that means making the amazingly funny newspaper comics we love so much.  Garfield works among lots of characters, both familiar (like Grimmy from ""Mother Goose and Grimm"" and ""Blondie's"" Dagwood - keep your eyes peeled for them) and unfamiliar (like Billy Bear and Randy Rabbit, and Bonita and Walter Steigman from ""Life Stinks"").  However, Garfield wants to know what it's like in the real world.  So, he does the unthinkable: he and Odie, his canine sidekick that he likes to kick around, cross the border where the comic world crosses the real world.  As much as Garfield enjoys life in the real world, he realizes that when you get out of the comic world, you can't get back in.  Also, to make matters worse, Garfield's absence means that his strip is going to be canceled !  It's up to Garfield in the real world as well as his friends back home to get him out of the real world and reclaim his comic !This is a rather good movie as seen on Cartoon Network.  Plus, there's a big buffet of bonus features including ones featuring ""Garfield"" creator Jim Davis, who even wrote the movie's cool concept and quirky dialogue !So Garfield fans of all ages will be thrilled at this impressive movie.

1208102,"""It's not the destination that matters. It's how you get there that counts.""Mark those words before you watch this one. A lot of surprises went down at the 2009 ROYAL RUMBLE PPV, and all of them worked. A couple titles changed hands, and many loyalties were tested. But even though I'm satisfied with where ROYAL RUMBLE 2009 has brought me, I didn't always enjoy the ride there.1) ECW ChampionshipMatt Hardy v. Jack Swagger (champion)---As expected, both men delivered a crisp opener to get us excited. Hardy has been a very reliable singles talent for quite a few years now, and Swagger's physical talents are well utilized. Amateur-style takedowns seem to be a trend in the WWE today, as Swagger often used some collegiate maneuvers to turn into suplexes. Matt Hardy's signature moves are becoming a little predictable now, but his resilience and timing are still crisp enough to keep us on the edge of our seats. All in all, this was my favorite of the four singles matches on tonight's card.""7.0 / 10""___________________________________________2) Women's ChampionshipMelina v. Beth Phoenix (champion)---This was one of the most unpredictable and unorthodox matches I've seen in quite some time. That's both a good thing and a bad thing with this match. There were quite a few moments when the ladies would pick up the pace, and their speed seemed to overcome their timing. Several slams and counters were off. However, the reason I overall liked this match was because there was some very strange offense from both women. Melina used kicks from every conceivable position to stay in the fight, while Phoenix implemented some very vicious power offense. There's a particularly savage leglock that you've got to see to believe. I think most will be able to sit through it, but I've seen these ladies do better against each other.""6.0 / 10""___________________________________________3) World Heavyweight ChampionshipJBL (w/ Shawn Michaels) v. John Cena (champion)---Pick a Cena/JBL match besides their ""I Quit"" Match a few years ago, and you've pretty much seen this one. This is getting ridiculous now, because JBL just pummels and torques Cena's body, yet the champ remains in the fight using only his signature moves. The only reason I'm not beating this one to death is because the angle with Shawn Michaels and JBL continues to be very good TV. It's a well-acted, well-constructed storyline that has kept me interested. Also, I will give credit to the match's interesting finish. However, the one-on-one match itself was average at best. I kinda enjoyed myself; then again, I was in a very comfy chair.""6.0 / 10""___________________________________________4) No Disqualifications - WWE ChampionshipJeff Hardy (champion) v. Edge (w/ Chavo Guerrero)---Vickie Guerrero came out and announced that there would be no rules for the title bout. And boy, I thought I had good reason to expect a knockout display of carnage. But then, Edge and Jeff started off with a relatively slower-paced contest. ""Okay,"" I thought to myself, ""This is a necessary way to begin, so that the weapons spots will mean more."" But quite frankly, this one just never gets off the ground. Not only is there very little ""No-DQ"" action, but also some of the more hardcore moments are dull. For example, there's a spot where Chavo Guerrero is lying on a table, and Jeff dives from a ladder onto him. That whole spot was ruined because Chavo was resting on the table after a few weak punches, just waiting for Jeff to crash on him. In fact, Chavo looked confused, because he'd cheat behind the referee's back in a No-DQ Match! The last 5 minutes include some nice counters and close calls. And as neat as the finish was, I don't think it'll hold up months from now. As it turns out, the ""No-DQ"" stipulation was good for the storyline, but didn't make the match any better. I was very disappointed with this display from these two gifted wrestlers.""6.5 / 10""___________________________________________5) 30-Man Royal Rumble---Anytime I watch a Royal Rumble on live PPV, I get a little exhausted when it's over. The suspense of the entrances, the close calls, the pile-up of wrestlers, and closing moments will always get me exhilarated on a first viewing. So I ask this: will the 2009 30-Man Rumble hold up on repeat viewings? The answer is, ""Yes"".First the good stuff:* The first half of this Rumble was non-stop excitement. The first 25 minutes has to be the most action-packed of any 30-Man Royal Rumble. There was so much going on that I couldn't keep up!* Seeing Rob Van Dam return to action was a genuine thrill. He entertained the Detroit crowd, got to show off some stuff, but also allowed the other wrestlers to do their jobs.* A lot of big names in this one. I knew who was going to win, but I kept second-guessing myself.  That's never a bad thing.* I've never seen so many near-eliminations in a Royal Rumble in my life. The number of times a superstar ALMOST touched the floor has to be a new record. Tons of suspense.* Randy Orton's victory celebration was perfect. He raised the hands of Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase for their assistance for getting him the win, and the final shots of Orton pointing to the WRESTLEMANIA 25 signs & pyro couldn't have been better timed. Orton knows how to use the camera to his advantage. Priceless!Okay, so what's not so good about the 2009 30-Man Royal Rumble?* The pileup became ridiculous. I think this Rumble featured the most superstars ever to be in the ring during a Rumble. This wouldn't have been an issue if the eliminations were more frequent.* Terrible way to use The Brian Kendrick. 15 seconds?! Just stupid!* The showdown between the final six competitors was good.  But as entertaining as it was, it was pretty obvious who was going to win. In hindsight, I should've paid more attention to how Orton was being talked about backstage.So, overall I think the 2009 30-Man Royal Rumble was on the verge of being the absolute best. The first half is non-stop excitement, and I challenge anybody to argue over that. But after a while, the match begins to drag, and gets pretty good in the final stretch. A very good 30-Man Royal Rumble. Not the best, but definitely one of my favorites.""7.5 / 10""___________________________________________ROYAL RUMBLE 2009 is a decent PPV. The biggest problem is that in every match, the finish overshadows the contest leading up to it. Matt Hardy and Jack Swagger delivered a solid match, but the camera lingered on Hardy afterwards, rather than pushing Swagger. Melina won the title in a very surprising fashion, but perhaps almost too surprising.Cena and JBL must stop working together, especially if you have Shawn Michaels at ringside. Let's face it: we knew he was going to get involved at some point. The whole time we're thinking about HBK, rather than Cena & JBL.Edge and Jeff Hardy have no excuse for their average display. I liked the betrayal finish as much as everyone else will, but considering how intense this storyline has gotten, the match was surprisingly soft.Thankfully, the 30-Man Royal Rumble is one of the better ones.  It drags a bit in the middle, and might be predictable by some people's standards.  But battle royals don't always entertain on repeat viewings; the 2009 30-Man Royal Rumble will stand the test of time.""It's not the destination that matters. It's how you get there that counts."" ROYAL RUMBLE 2009 does a good job setting up the months to come, but suffers as an individual chapter.",WWE: Royal Rumble 2009

Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) and Kate (Emma Thompson) are likable, middle-aged professionals who've resigned themselves to being single for the rest of their lives.  They keep themselves busy so that they won't notice how lonely they really are.  Harvey writes piano compositions in his spare time.  Kate takes writing classes and is forever taking phone calls from her mother (Eileen Atkins), concerned about her daughter's spinsterhood.  The film has its requisite ""meet cute"" scene -- three in fact -- as Harvey and Kate coincidentally meet time after time in London, where Harvey is attending his daughter's wedding.  Despite its formulaic structure, ""Last Chance Harvey"" works because of its two stars, who have terrific on-screen chemistry.

1212435,"Valkyrie is a movie based on the true story of the 1944 plot by German army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Starring Tom Cruise, the film contains all of the necessary elements for successful cinema: good acting, a worthy plot and suspenseful drama. Despite knowing of the ultimate failure of the assassination plot, the movie still is able to hold the audience in rapt attention.The movie begins when Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is injured while fighting Allied forces in northern Africa. Losing an arm and an eye in the attack, Stauffenberg is sent back to Berlin as an officer in the German army reserves. There he becomes involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler and overthrow the Nazi government so that peace can be brokered with the Allies. After several failed attempts, Stauffenberg succeeds to detonate a bomb in a situation room where Hitler is briefing his top generals. Believing Hitler to be dead, Stauffenberg races back to Berlin while his co-conspirators seizes control of the German reserve army and order them to arrest all SS troops, falsely accusing them of killing Hitler. The coup begins to succeed but falls apart when Hitler makes a national broadcast to prove he was still alive.Spoiler Alert!!!The SS troops are released from prison and surround the conspirators' headquarters where Stauffenberg and his accomplices are summarily executed.End Spoiler Alert!!!Cruise does an excellent job of portraying Colonel Stauffenberg and turns in one of the better performances of his career. The movie is actually remarkably historically accurate, as far as it goes, and truthfully relates the events almost exactly as they transpired. One can't help but wonder how different history could have turned out if the bomb Stauffenberg detonated had succeeded in killing Hitler or if the Valkyrie coup had succeeded in overthrowing the Nazi government. There are several moments in the movie where you realize if people involved in the Valkyrie plot had faithfully carried out their part in the coup, things might have turned out quite differently.I consider the film's criticism for not showcasing German accents to be minor and unrelated to the quality of the film.I appreciate the movie's attempt to convey the courage and moral fortitude these German soldiers displayed to actually move forward with a plot to assassinate their country's leader. They recognized that in order to be a ""good German"" they had to stop the ""bad Germans."" Though it was unquestionably the right thing to do and a valiant attempt to save lives, the officers involved still had to make several tough decisions along the way, knowing that if they failed in their attempts they faced certain torture and death.Many have pointed out, correctly, that Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators at first supported Hitler when he first rose to power.  This is true, yet they still deserve credit for realizing their errors and attempting to atone for their mistakes, even if it was belated.The movie only briefly alludes to Stauffenberg's devout Catholicism which undoubtedly paid a pivotal role in his decision to oppose Hitler. Though the movie does not mention it, Stauffenberg was also a member of German nobility. This is interesting only because those who were most prone to opposing Hitler were either the Christians, German aristocracy or the capitalists. Thus Stauffenberg met two of these characteristics. Though it is shamefully nearly forgotten today, the Nazis were a radical left-wing socialist movement and publicized themselves as a worker party.",Valkyrie

1225010,"With all due respect, the Amazon review is pretty much a whole lot of nuttin'.  My apologies to the author.  It's overly simplistic and dismissive and not in a fair way.  Not that this movie deserves the psychological dissection one would offer Bergman's ""Persona"" but it merits more than a begrudging, rueful wink.  Sure, the gore is evident; it's a horror film, but it's not, in any way, of the sadistic variety, like Hostel's or Saw's, two film franchises whose sole raison d'etre is find the most heinous forms of inflicting pain while simultaneously ratcheting zero on the mood and terror scale.  It's first rate sadism without any of the residual pleasure.  Just kidding.  Yep, the nude scene is pretty remarkable (and equally gratuitous) if for no other reason than its duration, but it's indicative of the director's take on the source material.  Tongue is firmly planted on cheek throughout, but not so much so that it borders on satire.  It's horror alright but just like the classic slasher films of the 70's and 80's it's steadily winking at its audience with the occasional jab at the ribs.  It's meant to be fun and it is.  It doesn't stray far from the original, but there are enough changes to make it feel contemporary but thankfully avoids the pitfalls that most modern horror films fall into and that is too much of everything except what matters - atmosphere, dread, panic, fear and sly humor; all essential components of the genre.  I enjoyed this movie a great deal more than I thought I would because I am a big of the original.  Great fun, jump scares and genuine edge of seat scenes, MBV, doesn't disappoint.  The 3D gimmick works well but the movie would be just as much fun and effective without it.",N/A

Then I bought the DVD years latter, and I actually enjoyed it very much. The only let down to this movie is that it's almost an exact copy-cat of the original series' episode ""The Changeling"".

Luckily I have three DVD players in my house, and two out of the three work for this DVD.As for the film itself, it's exciting, well made, great special effects, and it has a great ending without having the usual spaceship explosion in it. In all, this film shows what ""Star Trek"" is all about. It's not about having space battles with the enemy.

The ratings slid enough that it was cancelled and good fortune got it picked up by a rival network for the final season. The big difference, as fans learned in later years, was the effect that Andy Kaufman had on the show.What made Taxi so endearing was the creation of brilliant characters that were definitely New York personalities. It launched long careers for most of the cast. Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, Tony Danza, and company first came to national prominence because of their work on this show and the ensemble was exceptional. Unfortunately, the sudden fame had a negative impact on Andy Kaufman. After years toiling on the New York comedy scene and several memorable Saturday Night Live appearances, Andy was suddenly a superstar because of his Latka character. Sometimes a comic with a large repertoire of characters becomes resentful when one of his creations becomes more popular than the others. Robin Williams would regularly insult people in his audience who requested he do his Mork character, for example. Because he had talent in so many other areas, Robin moved past that period and Mork is now just a footnote in a long career. Sadly, Andy Kaufman didn't handle Latka's popularity nearly as well.By the middle of the third season, Kaufman was becoming increasingly difficult to work with on set. What had begun as an occasional annoyance during the filming of season 3, had grown into open warfare. He was often late, refused to talk to the rest of the cast, and began making unreasonable demands. The producers, deeply concerned that firing Kaufman would severely hurt the popularity of the show and already aware that Jeff Conaway would be leaving, began to do whatever they could to mollify Kaufman. The result was that the demands became more unrealistic, and the rest of the cast and writers became alienated. In season 4, Kaufman played his Latka character less and less. Instead, Latka developed multiple personalities. This allowed Kaufman to introduce a number of his more obnoxious creations to the nation. It also served to make Kaufman the center of an unbalanced number of episodes which also increased the unhappiness of the other cast members. There are times when you can actually see Judd Hirsch and several of the others openly roll their eyes at Kaufman in the background of some of the season 4 scenes. Finally the network became fed up and, after caving in and giving Kaufman his own prime time special (a famously bad bomb by the way) decided neither Kaufman nor the show was worth it. It's a shame because this was one of the shining examples of excellent casting and timing that television will ever see.Season 4 isn't a total loss. There are many wonderful episodes and famous Taxi moments to be found and fans of the series won't be disappointed by what they see. Christopher Lloyd, charged with the job of making the Reverend Jim character a viable replacement for Latka's oddness, really comes into his own and Devito in particular manages to chew up the scenery in his own unique way.  But if you find yourself thinking that something just doesn't seem quite right as you watch this season, hopefully this review will help you put your finger on it.Most tv shows reach a point where things seem to go adrift and quality slips. It's common enough that it has its own show business term; ""Jumping the Shark."" The name comes from the Happy Days episode where Fonzie jumps over a shark tank. It served as the best example of what happens when the creators of a show simply run out of good ideas. In Season 4 of Taxi, the show jumps the shark. As I said, that sort of thing happens all the time. What's unusual here is that the blame largely falls on the shoulders of one person. Andy Kaufman was a brilliant comic and a wonderful talent. He found humor in unique places and his fall from fame is well-chronicled. His unchecked ego badly impacted the quality of a fine tv show known not just for its humor, but also for its unflinching willingness to examine the sensitive issues of the day. Season 4 is no exception in this area as, among other things, we see Hirsch's Alex character explore interracial dating.As you watch this season of Taxi you will have to work around and tolerate the often bizarre manifestations of Andy Kaufman's alternate personalities. He will either dominate the proceedings in most episodes, or be completely absent because he didn't show and the writers had to work around his tantrums. I can tell you that both the story lines and the talent of the remainder of the cast make the effort well worth it. It's a true shame because had Kaufman been a bit more patient and handled things with more grace, this show could easily have remained successful for another 5 seasons instead of sputtering to a finish a year later.",N/A

This movie ain't it. Ed Harris, so brilliant elsewhere, is hilariously miscast. The script is a one-day-pass to Beethoven World.

1106317,"Heima (Dean DeBlois, 2007)DeBlois (Lilo and Stitch) chronicles the 2006 homecoming of Icelandic shoegaze band Sigur R&oacute;s, which combines the usual documentary-style interviews and location shots with footage of twelve concerts the band played in their native land, all free, all unannounced. A must, obviously, for fans of the band, but others will find themselves enchanted by the location footage, of which the decision to include so much must have been a conscious one (after all, the film's name, translated, is ""Home""); at times it feels a lot less like a documentary about a rock band than it does a documentary about Iceland that happens to include a live soundtrack.

1265559,"Being a teenager and being bored - those two things seem to go hand-in-hand. For J.T. and his friend this means skipping school, thinking long and hard about the ""where"" that comes with drinking, and then deciding on an abandoned mental institution. At first this amounts to the destruction of property and demystifying the premises, but the afterward finds them exploring a little place called ""the tunnel."" In the tunnel the two find many things, but the most intriguing of all is a girl that is bound in chains and seemingly abandoned, all alone but still alive. Things get odder after one of the boys stays with her and decides to take out all his anger on her, breaking her neck in the process. The only problem is that this does not kill her - on the contrary, it starts a landslide that leaves everyone wondering where she came from, what she is doing here, and why she will not die.While Dead Girl starts out slow and leaves a lot of questions unanswered, it does answer one key thing that makes me think that we all know the answers to what she is. When we first see the girl, she seems harmless enough. By the time some answers pour in and this faade is pulled away, however, she seems less like someone that was tormented and more like someone that you would chain in a basement because of a really good reason. That makes her scary and understandable at the same time, explaining how she was put into an institution and why she would be left behind, and it says a lot about the effort she put into making a character with no speeches or threats into something that changes its proverbial face. The actors do a good job of selling certain things about their characters as all of this is happening, too, making the movie one that is frightening and engaging all at the same time. The plot takes a few twists and turns as well, and the ending is one of those that really stayed with me.Dead Girl has a lot of stuff in it that the movie does not discuss - it has nudity and violence and a lot of very disturbing notions. For this reason, some people may be turned off by the movie. Others may like the movie simply because the portrayal of the people is a real one in a lot of ways, showing the dark side of people and even the ugly side of caring. Personally, I liked it - even the slow parts - knowing how it all fit together. If you like a dark movie and have some time to check it out, I would say that it may be worth your time. Just don't let the editorial review or the cover review of the movie throw you - this is not a coming-of-age movie or some walk in the after-dark park.If you can abide by that, then you should find yourself watching something you could really find interesting.",Deadgirl

329205,"It came as a shock to see Mick Jagger's visage staring out from the dvd case of this movie but it also immediately raised my suspicions.  For, as big as the Rolling Stones are, if the movie had been any good certainly it would be well-known.  I suspect that any play this now gets is by people curious to see Jagger act.Ned Kelly is an Australian outlaw hero who has taken on mythic proportions.  If you spend any time around Australians (males, anyway) it is a sure bet that Ned Kelly's name will come up at some point, often in relation to his use of boiler plate armor to fight off the law.  That's about all I know about him but his is a romantic story begging to be put on film.This attempt falls flat for any number of reasons, yet the look and feel of the movie should be commended and alert viewers to the beauty of many of the movies made in the 1960's and 70's; the look of which aren't or can't be duplicated using today's modern methods.  It's not what the director intended, I'm sure, but watching this movie made me nostalgic to go back and watch Peckinpah and Sturges, among others.The real problem with this movie is that the script is crap, as is much of the acting, including Jagger's; although, he is still fun to watch.  The writers fail to supply a narrative that pushes the story forward in a logical manner.  Rather than dialogue the actors are given single lines which, because they are mostly mere responses or interjections do nothing to tell the story.  This might have worked if the visual narrative stood in for the lack of real dialogue (Anyway, real dialogue would have been difficult to understand beneath the thick Hollywood brogues).  Instead the movie is comprised of scenes stitched together in a kind of incoherent moving picture mural.The soundtrack doesn't help unless you like Country music, that is, and I mean 1970's style Country rather than the Country Pop of today.The music isn't poorly done, even if not to my liking, but it turns the mood of the movie into a sort of Irish Republican allegory.  One suspects this was intentional as the troubles in Northern Ireland had begun to flare up around the time of this movie.  I'm not sure if the actors were in on it but it seems pretty difficult to misapprehend today.This movie is recommended only to people who want to look at Mick Jagger.",N/A
1213394,"It is actually a rather insulting story about a nave, weak and plain woman who is beautiful and has the means to dress fashionable. And who is, how original, the victim of her times. Of course the latter is tragic and unquestionably true for most women of that era, but personally I prefer to see a film about a strong and clever woman -who rises above the disadvantages society has given her- with humor, brilliant skills and vigour. I believe the REAL Duchess was such a woman. Obviously the makers of this film were unable to portray her since they clearly lacked all of her qualities.",The Duchess

1087935,"This is still the best dvd version of Traviata on the market.  I own five others, including, Netrebko, Fleming, and two with Gheorghiu, but none of those versions (which certainly have their strengths, both technically, and vocally) express the full gamut of the emotional power and the pathos that is at the heart of this great opera-tragedy.  It's all here:  Stratas, Domingo, and MacNeil singing and acting wonderfully; Zeffirelli's opulent movie staging [including a couple of unique treats:  1.) having Teresa Stratas made up to look like the classic portrait of the actual Marie Duplessis upon whom her character is based, and 2.) opening the movie with a scene that mimics the opening scene of Dumas' novel, wherein the late-and-lamented courtesan's effects are being carted away, after having been auctioned off to pay her debts].  Last, but certainly not least, Verdi himself seems to be guiding James Levine's baton.This 2008 DG dvd copy of La Traviata (theatrically released in 1982) is obviously meant to replace the 1999 dvd (Universal Studios) version.  There are some distinctions, however, and they are not unimportant.  For one, the sound has been improved.  Two, the 1999 version was shown in widescreen (1.66:1), this one is fullscreen (1.33:1); it appears to me that the film was originally filmed in fullscreen and then clipped on the top and the bottom to properly fill a widescreen commercial movie screen (I've read that some directors like to shoot their films this way, and Zeffirelli must be one of them).  Be that as it may, a bit of the right and left edges of the 1999 film are cut off here, but there is more top and bottom displayed in this newer dvd [so, we're actually seeing more picture content, but--paradoxically--in a smaller area (4:3)].  Three, the ridiculous [bracketed] closed captions, indicating ""[laughter], [music playing], [finale], etc."" have mercifully been eliminated from this new version.  Four, the DG dvd is less expensive.On the negative side:  even though the picture quality of this new version seems a little better than the widescreen version, it will never (ever) be mistaken for blu-ray, and two, there are (as with the 1999 version) some lip-syncing issues.  Lastly, although I think that this fullscreen version is slightly superior to the 1999 version, there is definitely something to be said for watching a film that fills your widescreen TV.  Enjoy!UPDATE (1-2-11):  For what it's worth, I noticed that Amazon has lumped the reviews of all three video versions of this performance together (i.e., the 2008 and 1999 DVDs, and the older VHS).  It goes without saying, therefore, that any of the 80-plus reviews written prior to 2008 relate to either the 1999 dvd or the older VHS tape.",Verdi: La Traviata

398862,"I didn't know that this was the last movie for Marilyn and Gable.  It was interesting.  I'm not a huge fan of Marilyn Monroe's.  I think Marilyn was, incidentally, one of the sources of the problems in movies today where there is too much of a prominence placed on symbolism over substance.  Having said that, Marilyn did a pretty good job in this movie.  I saw more substance in this movie than all the others I've seen combined.  The scene in the desert, where she screams at the brutality of the misfits, was top notch.  In that scene, and a few others in the movie, she displayed some acting talent that is missing in most of today's top starlets.  She evoked a lot of power in some scenes without saying a word.  In other scenes, she over acted a little.Gable played Gable throughout most of the movie, but the scene when he cried out to children was an odd scene for him to take part in.  It showed more weakness in the few minutes it occurred than I've seen in most of the few Gable movies I've seen.Clift was good, but I've seen him better in other movies.  He tended to play the same character in many of his movies, and that character was in this movie too.  He may have been a good actor, but I never saw too much range from him.The movie itself was uneven and inconsistent.  The lead to the arc was very interesting.  I can see why it was considered an off movie for it's era. It kind of lost itself in the arc, however, and I found myself wavering a little in the midst of the overdrawn characterization and setting.  There were interesting scenes, and I can see why some of the scenes were important, but they were a little too long.  Other scenes seemed irrelevant to me.  The close of the movie, from the point where they reach the desert on, was excellent.  All of the characters--even the Eli Wallach character--were rounded out here.  The close of the movie provided an explanation for why some of the scenes that I considered irrelevant were in fact relevant.  Overall, I considered this a really good movie.  It had problems sure, but I would definitely recommend it.",Misfits VHS

1155131,"Well, if you really feel like depressing yourself, this movie will certainly deliver. It is an interesting movie, but serious flaws are prevalent.The movie starts with the Kate Winslet character (April) feeling humiliation after an unsuccessful play performance. She quickly has a bitter argument with her husband Leonardo DiCaprio (Frank). We see that their marriage is having trouble at best, and at worst is already dead and waiting for the tragic inevitable end. Whatever people may think of Frank, he has a point when he says: ""It's not my fault that the play was lousy.""A flaw here is that April and Frank are both unhappy with their lives. And while April looks for an irrational escape, Frank seems more set in reality that they have 2 children as well as responsibilities. True, Frank is not happy at his job. But he's not going to 'jump ship' when he has a wife and 2 children. (One pun on ""The Titanic"" here is inevitable.)Later, April gets a strange idea to run away to France. What she says may sound good in THEORY. But how can she be sure of getting a job? Frank again carries reason when he says: ""It might make more sense if I were a writer or painter.""It is worth noting that while the movie doesn't mention it, April may very well be bipolar. The movie tries to keep sympathy balanced between the characters, but it just doesn't work. Towards the latter half, April finds that she is pregnant. And Frank knows that he has to go back to reality and accept a great promotion he has been offered.Whether you are anti abortion or pro choice, there is an unavoidable sting of reality when Frank says: ""A sane woman doesn't perform an abortion on herself so she can live out some fantasy."" April responds that it is for him. And Frank understandably responds: ""How can it be for me when the mere thought of it makes my stomach sick?!""Frank desperately tries to save the shambled remains of their marriage, but April only gets more cruel: ""I never loved you. You're just a man who made me laugh at a party."" At this point, we can scarcely blame Frank for his rage here: ""Then why are you living in my house? Why are you my wife?"" Also to his credit, despite his rage, he is able to avoid physically striking her.Another serious flaw in this movie is that they try to make a cruel and nasty man carry weight. (What he says is not fit to be printed here and would probably not be allowed here.) Charles Dickens often put the voice of reason into eccentrics, but without the profanity and cruelty.I'm not saying the movie does not have some worthwhile moments. But the story just doesn't work. While it tries to make April heroic, it just does not work. And it seems to try to make Frank look bad for keeping one foot in reality.Sorry; usually lightening just won't strike twice.",Revolutionary Road

1226380,"""Slumdog Milionaire"" is definitely a feel-good movie - from early on,young Jamal [Dev Patel] wins our hearts as he desperately tries to find his childhood sweetheart Latika [Freida Pinto] by entering the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Incredulous and sceptical of Jamal's intelligence [after all, Jamal is a 'slumdog'], the show's host [Anil Kapoor] gets him carted off by the police for interrogation. Faced by the cynical inspector [Irfan Khan of ""Namesake""], Jamal proceeds to convince the policeman of his innocence by recounting his childhood experiences till the present that accounts for his almost miraculous run of good luck on the show.I loved the child actors in this show - the ones who played Jamal, his brother Salim and Latika as children were absolutely incredible and wholly credible as street children struggling to survive, falling prey to the most predatory and repugnant of criminals, those who maim children in order that the kids may 'convincingly' beg on the streets to fill the criminals coffers. One of the most horrifying scenes in this movie is the part where the criminal mastermind watches over the removal of a little boy's eyes.So why only 3 stars you may ask - I liked this movie a lot but I did find that it didn't truly explore the plight of street children which it purportedly aims to portray on-screen. The coverage somehow seems shallow, using the story arc of the child maiming syndicate to shock audiences instead. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I've watched too many Indian movies that deal more convincingly with such themes - ""Nayagan"" [Tamil, starring Kamal Hasan, a renowned South Indian actor], Thalapathi [Tamil, stars Rajni Kanth], the incomparable Salaam Bombay [1988,Hindi by Mira Nair], and also City of Joy [1992, English, starring Patrick Swayze] all are more credible in showing the plight of street children.""Slumdog Millionaire"" on the other hand is a Bollywood fairytale with a predictably happy ending. It makes one feel good, and in a world filled with cruelty and depravity, most of us are happy to see the fulfillment of Jamal's dreams. But reality is very different, and the majority of street children in India will never experience even a fraction of the success that Jamal attains in this movie. Final verdict: excellent and visually stunning escapist fare.",N/A
1274234,"We open with a promo for the benefits of Helium-3. In the future, it's been discovered that the sun's rays bathe our moon with this precious substance and can be harvested, shipped back to Earth, and used as a pollution-free power source by means of nuclear fusion. The only hitch, apparently, is that harvesting Helium-3 requires an astronaut to spend three years on the far side of the moon, where darkness and barren landscapes serve as reminders of just how isolated he will be. This is the situation Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) finds himself in. Even with a well-stocked food supply and various forms of entertainment, one can only be alone for so long before the mind begins to deteriorate. Is there any way to account for talking to yourself? Is there any way to account for a literal interpretation of that last statement?There are such fascinating psychological concepts coursing through ""Moon,"" the feature film debut of Duncan Jones, son of musician David Bowie. He tells a story, but he seems much more interested in probing the human mind. This is interesting given the fact that, at this unspecified point in time, there's no real way to define what it means to be human. I'm being annoyingly vague, I know, but this isn't a film that easily lends itself to detailed descriptions. The audience will continuously be asking, ""Why?"" all throughout, which is good because Bell is asking himself the exact same question. Things are happening for reasons no one is entirely sure of, save for the fact that this entire operation is run by a corporation. Corporations have agendas. Agendas have to be kept.The story unfolds gradually and doesn't actually begin until the moment Bell crashes his rover vehicle into an automated harvest machine. He awakens in the medical ward of the main station completely unaware of what happened. He is, however, continually reassured by the station's computer, GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), who has a central unit running along a track on the ceiling. It obviously has no feelings, but it is programmed to know which emoticon to display at the appropriate moment. Does this computer know more than it lets on? Why was it able to have a live video conference when Bell could only rely on recorded messages sent back and forth? He could have had the chance to speak directly with his wife, Tess (Dominique McElligot). Then again, after three years, she's likely to be a very different person.GERTY, whose monotone voice is eerily incompatible with its accommodating nature, will inevitably be compared to HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Indeed, there many distinct similarities throughout the whole film, from the sterile look of the station's rooms to the emphasis on science and technology. That being said, ""Moon"" doesn't end with a spiritually profound statement. It goes for a more existential approach, continuously exploring themes of sanity, isolation, physical health, and most importantly, self-discovery. I'd like to say more on that last point, but I think you'll enjoy this movie much more if you go into it cold, as I did. Not knowing beforehand what I would be experiencing allowed me to think about it all throughout on a deeper level.Much of the story plays like a duel, in one corner a reasonably fit Bell, in the other a Bell whose body seems to be losing cohesion. He's feverish and pale. He continuously coughs up blood. He's weak and hostile. There isn't much of an explanation for this, but it does make for an interesting visual counterpoint, quite possibly made with the intention of representing different aspects of his personality. Other traits come into play, none more telling and understandable than his hobby of carving wood into miniature buildings, complete with miniature people. He also tends a small potted garden, and he makes a point of talking to the plants as he gently sprays them with water. Three years is an awfully long time on the moon. Even holding a conversation with GERTY can't possibly be enough to keep him going.The mysterious nature of the story is second only the mysterious nature of the moon itself. We know that it's reachable, and indeed, we've been there before. But how much do we really know about it? What secrets lurk within the craters and deep shadows? In the future tense of ""Moon,"" corporate entities see it not as a celestial enigma but as a resource, and who's to say how long they can rely on it before it's depleted? How long can you rely on people as a resource? These questions are never posed in the film, but I sure did think about them as I was watching. ""Moon"" is a science fiction fable of the cerebral kind, one that refuses to bombard the audience with typical action-grade clich&eacute;s like laser blasts and spaceship fights and alien invasions. It works not as a spectacle but as a thoughtful analysis. We all use technology, but have we ever stopped to consider the psychological ramifications?",N/A

866036,"Amazing how people will accept things based on a label.  The term in movies and TV ""over the top"" in reality means the writers and directors have no restraint or taste.  Deadwood initially had me devided between loving the characters, plot, setting and hating the ""over the top"" use of constant swearing.  Yup, I'll bet there was plenty of swearing back then but there was a balance of normal conversation and salty talk just like there is today.  I sat in a breakroom with a co-worker recently who went on a tirade about something or another for no more than 5 minutes.  I kept track of how many times he used the ""F word"" in those mere 5 minutes and it was 75 times. He also used the word ""dude"" about as many times but I couldn't keep track of both words.  Too much work! It would be interesting to take a work of Mark Twain and fill it with F***ing C**ks***ers to the point of absurdity.  His artful writing would be obscured with the attention drawn to childish profanity.  I use the ""F word"" on occasion when the occasion warrents but I use it for the ultimate of expression.  In other words I use it when circumstances themselves are ""over the top"".  Its a GREAT form of expression when used when something has got you completely and absolutely rilled.  Therefore, I RESERVE it for times I want to make a point when normal language doesn't suffice.  And there's the problem with Deadwood, a Mark Twain should have written the script and been allowed to pepper in some salty dialogue for occasional EMPHASIS.  Mark Twain spent some time in Silver City, Nevada and had real life experience with what the town of Deadwood was really like so too bad he's not around.  I'd sure like to have Mark Twain write the script for Deadwood but it sounds more like it was written by my co-worker.  Yo, yo, yo mother f***ing c***sucker the wild west was never so f***ing cool, dude! Could have been a great series had the writers and directors understood that the term ""over the top"" is in reality a derogotory one and the word ""restraint"" is a good one to follow.",N/A

675503,"I am going to say right off the bat, if you are not a fan of Donovan than please do not buy this set. If you are remotely interested what this set has to offer than rent it. If you want a nice and lengthy look into the career of Donovan than this is for you.This is a 2 DVD set, the first disc is a 3 hour documentary on the life of 60's folk musician Donovan. It is an interview with the man himself in which he takes you on his ""journey"" through his life and history as a musician via vinatge performance clips and private films. Other interviews include his wife Linda, his arranger James Cameron, luthier Danny Ferrington and not much else. Unfortunately, some friends of Donovan are no longer with us such as Mickey Most, George Harrison, Keith Moon, Brian Jones, and Gram Parsons. Other contemporaries from the era are conspicuous from the absence, which is a shame; it would have been nice to have Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Danny Thompson, Shawn Philips or John Paul Jones talk about their involvement with Donovan. But then again maybe the blame should be laid at the director's feet. I would think in better hands the story would have been more varied with many different points of view if more of Donovan's contemporaries were interviewed. However, that does not mean it is a bad documentary either. Donovan tells his story like the story teller he is.People have criticized about how Donovan's pontifical nature is off putting. To me he comes off like a teacher showing those who are interested in him how and what moved him artistically and musically. I have never walked away from any musical documentary and not think the subject had a big ego. You have to have a big ego and a sense of arrogance about yourself in the arts so I was not surprised about some of his posturing.The second disc contains 2 hours of live performances, the ""Wear Your Love Like Heaven"" promo film, extended interviews and performances of songs as well as trip into Donovan's archives. While not as elaborate as a certain Canadian with an even bigger ego as Donovan's, it is kind of fun.If you are a fan of Donovan and music documentaries than this is for you, at 5 hours you are getting your money's worth along with a booklet of liner notes and photos. Be forewarned Donovan is the main man here; you are not going to get any interviews with other musicians from the era which rather narrows the scope of the story. However, that is not really up to me now is it?Oh by the way, all you people who say that Donovan stole from Bob Dylan well Dylan stole from Woody Guthrie, so there.",N/A
307108,"Shepperton Studios in England put together an H.G. Wells adaptation of the First Men in the Moon, a childhood favorite of mine.  Even today I don't mind rewatching it over and over.  Ray Harryhausen's insect creatures and giant man-eating caterpillars are quite cool.The movie starts off like a Disney film, first with present day astronauts discovering a British flag on the moon!  How did that happen?Flashback: The bumbling professor [Lionel Jeffreys]  with attendant explosions and an underlying genius flies off to the moon with Arnold {Edward Judd]  and his girlfriend Kate [Martha Hyer]. To make a long story short, Professor Cavil invents a substance that can block gravity. Our heroes hop in a sphere and up they go.The science of course is totally off and requires a suspension of disbelief, since they don't wear gloves and didn't once implode.A clear commentary on the warlike nature of Man.  First thing Arnold does is brain a few insects and throw them into a boiling river of blue lava.  Nice guy.  The chat the professor has with the head insect king in a cool crystal is telling.The special effects are not badly done, though other Harryhausen vehicles such as Jason and the Argonauts and 20 Million  Miles to Earth (the Venus creature, cool) are better.Excellent example of what an entertaining sci-fi film can accomplish.Recommended sets:Ray Harryhausen Collection (+ BD Live) (20 Million Miles to Earth, Earth vs. Flying Saucers, It Came from Beneath the Sea, 7th Voyage of Sinbad) [Blu-ray]The Fantastic Films of Ray Harryhausen - Legendary Monster Series (Jason and the Argonauts / The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad / The Golden Voyage of Sinbad / Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger / The 3 Worlds of Gulliver)",N/A

Colbert nails what the genre of Christmas special with an improbable story line, celebrities appearing out of nowhere to sing, goofy humor, and very amateurish graphics. If you remember the 1970s, it brings you back, yet the content pokes fun of timely topics.The songs are very clever and funny. We had fun speculating whether Toby Keith really understood the satire on the whole ""war on Christmas"" theme. The whole cast coming together singing, ""Peace, Love, and Understanding"" is surprisingly good. Of course, Willie Nelson, Feist, John Legend, and Jon Stewart are highly entertaining in their numbers.This DVD is worth having for future Christmases.

1256644,"The unfortunate lineup of games included in this set is listed below. As a longtime Vikings fan, I'm really disappointed that this greatest games collection doesn't include anything from the Super Bowl years. In fact, not only does this set not include any Fran Tarkenton games, it doesn't even include any Tommy Kramer or Daunte Culpepper games (Kramer was on the roster for one of them, but Wade Wilson was the starter).As someone who has followed the Vikings since they were perennial Super Bowl contenders, I honestly believe that only two of these games qualify as two of their ""greatest"" games. At the very least, the Kramer to Rashad miracle game versus Cleveland in 1980 should have been included in this set (lots of copies exist among collectors). The Vikings also played 3 great playoff games against the Rams in the 1970s. At least one of those should have qualified, not to mention playoff wins over the Cowboys and Redskins during that same time.I am glad they saw fit to finally include a Vikings set (How about a team history DVD, too?), but ignoring the Purple People Eaters is a huge snub to longtime Viking fans. That era DID matter. Two stars for the two games that rightfully belong in this set.12/28/08 Vikings 20 Giants 19The Vikings clinch their division against the Giants' second string. Hardly one of the greatest games in Vikings history. Also available on iTunes.11/04/07 Vikings 35 Chargers 17This one probably deserves to be in a greatest games set. Adrian Peterson rushed for 296 yards as the Vikings upset the Chargers.01/09/2000 Vikings 27 Cowboys 10A wild-card round playoff win over the Cowboys before getting destroyed by the Rams in the divisional round. The Vikings held the Cowboys scoreless after the first quarter. I don't know if anything from the Jeff George era belongs in a Vikings greatest games collection.01/10/1999 Vikings 41 Cardinals 21Something from the 1998 season needed to be included in this set, but this divisional round playoff game wasn't necessarily a great game. The Vikings led 24-7 at halftime and won rather easily. A better choice might have been the Vikings Monday night victory over the Packers during the regular season.01/09/1988 Vikings 36 49ers 24Okay, this one does qualify as one of the Vikings greatest games (IMO). The Vikings upset the heavily favored 49ers in the divisional round of the playoffs. Unfortunately, Darrin Nelson came up a step short in the conference finale the next week versus the Redskins.Update:I went ahead and purchased this set because I'm an idiot, and because I didn't already have two of the games included in it.  It came today with an intriguing surprise.  The cover of the DVD case says that this is the Viking's ""5 Greatest Games Volume 1"".  If they actually do produce a Volume 2, I hope they open the selection up to fan voting because I can think of many more deserving games (c'mon, the 2008 Giants game????).  Okay, I have 5 games to watch before the Giants set comes out next week (sad when a Viking fan looks forward to a Giants set, but these games are pretty ho hum).",NFL: Minnesota Vikings - 5 Greatest Games
1287170,"Commercials on TV created a great hype for this movie. What a disappointment it was. First, entire movie was filmed like TV citcom office style, you know, reality show image. Cameras following one person and this person talking to audience. There you have it. Now, include some liberal politics and agenda into this mix, you have district 9!!!An alien ship comes and parks over Nigeria. It turns out bug like aliens, their ship broke and they need refuge. They are placed in an isolated camp!!! called district 9. And many humans do not want them there, but socialist government( you will discover this as you watch) wishes to offer eaual opportunity to these aliens. So, plans are drawn to move aliens from district 9 to another location but this move CANNOT be done, unless aliens agree and sign moving documents!!!! A group of government employees are assigned to go in district 9 and get aliens sign these documents. Mind you that all these are happening in reality show style. During this operation, lead person( same guy is talking to cameras), finds a can of liquid and this liquid sprays on his face. This starts a genetic mutation on this guy. I can't even type this, soo bad...Well, as this guy slowly becoming an alien, plot thickens and he befriends with another alien who is trying to fix their broken ship and go home. Meanwhile, government is very much interested in this guys mutation into alien from human form. So, they are after him, while he is trying to help this one alien to fix his ship. Aliens has superior weapons and huge fire power. Easily they can over power humans but no alien ever touches any gun. Some reason, they are extremely peaceful, yet have those deadly weapons!!!!, our guy, who is muating into alien can now use alien weapons since these weapons bio-genetically locked. Anotherwords, you must be alien to use them. Again, some reason, our mutant boy is also hesitant to use these weapons against anyone. he cries alot, becauase his feelings get hurt and he is in distress when he faces crisses. Take my word for it, RENT IT first from redbox for a dollar to see if you like it. Horrible movie....By the way, at the end, he turns into full alien and the only alien who he help to fix the huge ship rest of the aliens came in. This alien fixes the ship and takes off.

599228,"Firstly, I have never seen this show before.  I saw in on Amazon for under $20 and I need a show.  I need a show with enough action to keep my attention on the tredmill every night, and preferably enough of a female element to interest my wife, so we have a show to watch together.  Alias meets both criteria, but only just barely.All my reviews are spoiler free, so I won't ruin the plot by giving it away, but seriously, 1/2 of all the episodes involve secret agent Sydney Bristow dressing up in a slinky outfit with a sexy hairdo to infiltrate a swanky party always being thrown in the same building as a secret base for her to break into and steal some item or artifact.  Apparently bad guys are quite fond of swanky parties and also can't get away from the ""office"" long enough to really enjoy them, so why not throw a party at the secret bad guy base?  Perfect!  Well maybe not.  Sure, I can appreciate Jennifer Garners mid driff and long sexy legs as much as the next guy, but after a while it feels like I'm watching a game of ""dress up"" when every other episode involves her dolling up in a new sexy dress.Mixed in with the action are ""daddy issues"", ""mommy issues"", friend issues, romance, long discussions worthy of daytime drama and a good dose of crying and hand wringing over Sydneys life foibles.  Fortunatly, my wife enjoys those parts too, so it gives us something to enjoy together, Alias has become ""our show"".There is too much violence and torture for my tastes.  Some things the bad guys (and some of the ""good guys"") do is just too graphic for the both of us.We bought the whole series and will watch it all eventually, but the main plot line is starting to feel too much like ""Lost"", which is a show I despise.  ""Lost"" is a snipe hunt.  After watching ""Lost"" for years, it has become clear that there is no underlying plot, its just a bunch of crap the writer thinks up over coffee that day.  If you remember Lost, there was a point where the story starting going off from reality (People stranded on an island trying to survive) to fantasy (smoke monsters, dead people flash backs, mystical powers, etc).  The first half of Alias season one is quasi reality (a female secret agent) and 1/2 way through gets mystical (500 year old prophesies, machines created by an ancient mystic prophet named Rambaldi who keeps coming up for reasons that are, by the end of Season 1, not at all explained) and part of it starts to feel silly.Overall the writing is passable.  There are a couple good scenes and a couple good plot twists.  In fact there are many plot twists, but most of them are blindingly obvious.  A lot of the time I can't tell if the writers are being serious or tounge-in-cheek as well.  One time they need to disarm some C4 plastic explosives.  It is ""hidden"" in a maintenance closet in big boxes with ""C4"" written all over it.  One character says, ""well I can tell its C4, because it has ""C4"" written all over it.""  Also, working in Network Admin (as I do) is a liability for enjoying some of the show, because I know that things don't work the way the writers think they do.  Wireless Modems don't steal data off hard disks just by putting them 4 inches away from a mainframe, for example...  Unfortunatly, there is quite a bit of this sillyness, but thats a common problem.In the end, each episode got me interested enough to watch the next, so its certainly worth the under $20 price, but I have no doubt that the whole underlying ""Rambaldi"" plot will not pan out to my satisfaction...",Alias - The Complete First Season

Friendship is the theme of the movie, and we learn how to accept the worst life has to offer. The baby sister is an absolute doll, and the little girl who plays ""Leslie"" is charming.As others have said already, the movie was really poorly presented by the previews, etc. The fantasy element serves only to parallel and add color to the trials of our heroes, similar to Pan's Labyrinth.When and if I have kids, this is going in their dvd library. 5 stars, because I like to reward good behavior.",Bridge to Terabithia

988166,"Ah, ""You Are Not Alone"", a film notorious among a certain group for a scene of two boys showering together. Yes, it certainly has that, but thankfully it also has much, much more.My first thought with this film was that it was rather likeDazed & Confused - Criterion Collection, except Danish and gay. Otherwise there are a LOT of similarities. You several story threads, some drug use, plenty of music and lots of sexuality, in addition to a huge supply of long-haired 1970's boys.The film centers around a group of boys at an all-boys boarding school in Denmark. We follow several of them through their adventures, but mainly focus on a student named Bo and the son of the headmaster, Kim, who he falls in love with.Other plots include a cafeteria worker who apparently enjoys deflowering underage boys, two boys who often fight with each other, a pair of other boys getting it on in the showers (to prove that, no, in fact the main characters are not alone), some townies who cause problems for our heroes, and one boy who gets suspended for display large amounts of pornography, which leads to a good ole (as it were), fashioned student uprising.I was actually surprised at how good this film was. I cared about all the characters, not just the main two, and was interested in the fates of all of them. I was also quite pleased that unlike in most gay fiction, we don't have anyone get gay-bashed, commit suicide, or wind up dead.The only thing that even slightly got on my nerves with this movie were the songs which I am sure sound great in Danish, but don't work so well when you're reading English subtitles.Overall this is a good movie I'd recommend to just about anyone, gay or straight. Especially teenagers, as there's several good lessons to be learned from this film about standing up to authority and tolerating other people's sexuality. It's a lesson more people can and should learn.",N/A

1214852,"I've always been a fan of the movie but never saw the TV show, and when I noticed all the sterling reviews it was getting and found it at a great price, I picked it up.  Sadly, right away I could tell it was not going to appeal to me, and as I watched more episodes in hopes that it would get better, I found I was forming a litany of gripes with it.  The show is clearly a product of the 80s, signified by the cheap looking intro (where the ""dark"" world is shown by using a negative of an image) and the pedestrian picture quality.  The acting is horrid, with the majority of actors giving one-note performances, which might not be so bad if the show gave us compelling stories ... not so.Like the EC and 60's DC and Marvel horror comics I adore, many of the stories hinge on a final twist, and yet many of them don't handle this well, telegraphing the twist far too early (""If The Shoes Fit,"" ""Grandma's Last Wish,"" ""Anniversary Dinner"") or using a twist that doesn't make a lot of sense and so isn't earned (""Trick or Treat,"" ""The New Man"").  There are a few episodes that actually handle story and suspense well, such as ""Snip, Snip"" and ""The Madness Room,"" which despite their low-budget pedigree are on par with any Tales From The Crypt story, but these are subsumed by the overwhelmingly poorer episodes.  ""The False Prophet"" is the perfect example of an episode gone wrong, with an annoying one-note lead and a story that rips the best elements of the Twilight Zone episode ""Nick of Time"" and the ""Bishop of Battle"" segment fromNightmaresand creates a silly mash that ends all too predictably.Thankfully, the episodes are brief (about 21 minutes each), and so Paramount was able to fit the entire 24 episode season on 3 single-sided discs.  Because they were created for TV, all of the episodes are given a standard presentation instead of widescreen.  The DVD case is standard-sized, or the size of a regular DVD case, with a single leaf that holds 2 discs, the 3rd residing on the inner right side of the case.  The case is clear plastic and the artwork is double-sided, with the episode listing and a brief summary for each one printed inside.  All in all, the set is compact and nicely-packaged (I'm a big fan of clear DVD cases!).  My 3-star rating for this product comes from averaging 2 stars for the unintentionally cheesy show, and 4 stars for the packaging.No offense intended to the fans who grew up watching the show and those just getting into it.  I'm just looking to caution those who haven't seen it and are thinking about buying it - rent it first.  Also, I'd suggest instead getting any set of Tales From The Crypt as well as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, the newer Outer Limits, and the far superiorTales from the Darkside: The Movie.

257885,"""The Verdict"" is one of the all-time great courtroom films.  The basic storyline involves Paul Newman as a broken-down ambulance-chasing plaintiff's attorney who nonetheless has gotten hold of an excellent medical malpractice case.  The Newman character had a streak of very bad luck earlier in his career, and is now an alcoholic wreck, neglecting his law practice as he descends into failure.One of the interesting things about this film is that unlike most legal flicks, this one involves a civil suit rather than a criminal case.  And it handles it, for the most part, very well.  In the story Newman totally botches the case in most respects.  I did think that the movie's handling of the issues Newman had with the Judge was somewhat unrealistic (no lawyer would speak to a Judge that way).  Setting these nits aside, this is nonetheless a fine film and an engaging storyline.  I would like to list some of the technical inaccuracies about the trial and litigation process as this film presents them, but I will not for fear of introducing spoilers.Newman fully explores his range as an actor, a great actor, in this film.  In most of his films he plays an assertive, aggressive type.  Here, he is hesitant, lacking in confidence--in fact he is a failing wreck who has been defeated by life and past villains.  He pulls it off brilliantly, and his characterization is highly believable.  This is an Oscar-caliber performance, although Newman was edged out in 1982 when the film hit the theaters.James Mason pulls a bravo performance as the ""Prince of Darkness"" defense counsel.

Get it at Amazon.]This is not as opulently beautiful as some of Zhang Yimou's films but the story is compelling and wonderfully told with deep affection for the characters.  It's a love story beginning in the present with the death of a beloved village school teacher whose widow demands that he be honored by having his body carried--not driven--from where he died to his home in the small mountain village where he taught for over 40 years.  The expense seems extravagant and where will the pallbearers come from?  Most of the young people have left the village for the cities.Returning for the funeral is the dead teacher's son.  He realizes how important this ancient tradition of actually, physically carrying the body home, and so he goes about making that happen for his illiterate mother who is now all alone.The real focus of the movie however is the extraordinarily beautiful face of the then 19-year-old Zhang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 2000; Memoirs of a Geisha 2005) who plays Zhao Di, the mother as a young woman.  We are flashed back to the teacher's arrival in the village and to the young Zhao Di doing everything in the exuberant way of first love that she can to catch his eye.  Again and again Zhang has his camera focused tightly on Zhang Ziyi's face as she experiences love at virtual first sight and goes through all the emotions of love's labors.  Pointedly Zhang Yimou shows only her face.  Her body is covered in the padded winter clothes of the Chinese north.In this focus on the skill, charisma and beauty of Zhang Ziyi one sees perhaps the influence of some Western directors like Ingmar Bergman, Krzysztof Kieslowski and Roget Vidam who made movies in homage to the beauty of their young stars, Bergman with Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, Kieslowski with Juliette Binoche and Irene Jacob, and Vadim with Bridget Bardot and Jane Fonda.As always in the films of Zhang Yimou one sees in the background or off to a side a gentle but penetrating subtext on the effect that communism has had on Chinese society.  Here he gives not criticism but guidance as he carefully insists that the traditional ways have value and should not be completely shoved aside.",The Road Home
43085,"""From the Earth to the Moon"" is a wonderful mini-series chronicling mankind's greatest achievement: putting men on the moon and bringing them safely home. If you've never thought about how truly amazing this feat was, you will after watching this. It not only makes heroes out of the courageous astronauts who put their lives at risk with every mission, but also the scientists and engineers who developed the technology to accomplish this unprecedented journey.Below are my brief reviews of each episode (plus grades)PART 1: CAN WE DO THIS? - In 1961, President Kennedy set the goal of putting a man on the moon before the end of the decade. It becomes NASA's job to figure out how to do it (and beat the Russians). The first episode introduces many of the characters, both scientists and pilots, who will fulfill this mission. It also effectively portrays the magnitude of the task. Grade: APART 2: APOLLO ONE - A tragic accident during a training exercise claims the life of three astronauts on the eve of the first Apollo flight. Congress now questions whether the hazards and expense are justified. The dramatic hearings where NASA officials had to convince the government that the space program was worth the risk make for a riveting episode. Grade: A-PART 3: WE HAVE CLEARED THE TOWER - Seen primarily through the eyes of a documentary film crew, this segment shows the tense build up to Apollo 7, the first manned mission after the tragedy of Apollo 1. Though it effectively shows the concerns of those involved, the episode drags a bit getting to the big launch. Grade: BPART 4: 1968 - A turbulent year marked by war, assassinations and riots, 1968 also saw Apollo's first successful orbiting of the moon. One of the less engaging episodes because too much time is spent brooding over the year's terrible events and not enough time is spent in space. Grade: B-PART 5: SPIDER - One of my favorite episodes of the series, ""Spider"" outlines the evolution of the lunar lander, the crucial piece of the puzzle needed to get astronauts to the moon's surface. A fascinating and fitting tribute to the great minds that worked on the project. Grade: APART 6: MARE TRANQUILITATIS - It all led to this: Apollo 11 - July 20, 1969. The first landing on the moon is as thrilling and stirring as you would expect. We did it, and we did it before the deadline! When Buzz Aldrin takes communion to commemorate the event, I was moved to tears. Grade: APART 7: THAT'S ALL THERE IS - Believe it or not, there were other missions to the moon after Apollo 11. Although public interest had waned, the flights continued. The personalities of the men of Apollo 12 are the highlight of this fun episode. Grade: A-PART 8: WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM - A malfunction during the flight of Apollo 13 nearly led to tragedy. The episode takes the unique approach of viewing these events from the perspective of news people and technicians on the ground, but this story is told better in the film ""Apollo 13."" Grade: BPART 9: FOR MILES AND MILES - Alan Shepard was the first American in space, but an inner ear condition then grounded him for years. Through his fight to regain flight status and get to the moon, I was rooting for him all the way.  Grade: APART 10: GALILEO WAS RIGHT - The later Apollo missions required men who were scientists as much as pilots. Though the episode is heavy on geology lessons, I found the astronauts' specialized training strangely captivating. Grade: A-PART 11: THE ORIGINAL WIVES CLUB - This episode focuses on the astronauts' wives and the toll the space program took on their lives and marriages. There is little action in space, but the human dynamics are poignant. Grade: BPART 12: LE VOYAGE DANS LA LUNE - The final Apollo voyage is interspersed with a recreation of George Melies' 1902 classic film. It's a fitting conclusion to the story of man's remarkable quest to visit the moon. After 35 years, why haven't we been back there? Grade: ABefore you view this series, let me suggest that you watch the excellent film ""The Right Stuff"" first. It lays out the events of our first ventures into space and introduces the original Mercury astronauts, several of whom appear in FTETTM. A good follow-up to the mini-series is the documentary ""For All Mankind,"" which features reflections from the astronauts and footage from the actual missions.I have to say, after seeing the monumental efforts, both intellectual and physical, that it took to reach the moon, I felt proud to be not just an American, but proud to be a human.",From the Earth to the Moon

385910,"According to most people I have spoken with, the 1984 George C. Scott version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL is most people's favorite.  I remember seeing it as a kid when it first aired on television.  I probably watched it a couple more times while growing up.  I saw it again about 5 years ago, and most recently, about a week ago.  Having read the book three or four times and watched numerous other performances, I have to say the George C. Scott's performance - though a worthy attempt - does not measure up to how Scrooge should be portrayed on screen.One point that this version did hit upon much better than any other verison I have ever seen was the role of Tiny Tim.  In this version, he actually looks (in the face) like a very sick child.  Other versions simply portray him as an otherwise healthy kid who for whatever reason gets around on a crutch (or on his father's shoulder).While it's true that every big and small screen version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL has taken it's own share of ""artistic liberties,"" the George C. Scott version not only follows the book pretty well in terms of story but gives the viewer an authentic glimpse of Victorian London in December as well as a peek into what was probably Ebenezer Scrooge's everyday life.  That aside, there is one or two glaring problems with this version.On one hand, although the morals in A CHRISTMAS CAROL are universal, one must remember that this is a very English story, and therefore Scrooge should either be played by an Englishman or at least by someone who can speak convincingly with an English accent.  Throughout most of this picture, George C. Scott does not seem to even put forth the effort to use an English accent.George C. Scott's Scrooge was a miser with a wry smile and an unattractive sense of humor.  While words like ""miser,"" ""wry,"" and ""unattractive"" are all fair descriptions of how Scrooge should be portrayed, the novel's description as well as that of most of the other film versions leave no place for any kind of a smile or sense of humor.George C. Scott looked like someone that it would have been easy to reform.  A proper portrayal of the unreformed Scrooge would show a man so disgusting in nature, so evil-looking that reform and redemption would seem impossible.  And the reformed Scrooge would look, at first glance, like a man who must have had some hard, terrible past.  (I think the Albert Finney version fulfills these two characteristics better than any other.)",A Christmas Carol VHS
1095561,"I really enjoyed Sheldon Wilson's ""Shallow Ground"", but this movie is terrible. The concept obviously works, check out Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". For some reason it doesn't work here. Maybe it's because of all the clich&eacute;s, but this film just fell apart from the get go. There is no suspense, the acting is half-hearted, and that's not just because of the bad script. I actually couldn't even sit through the entire movie. So do yourself a favor, don't waste an hour and a half of your life on this movie. I didn't.",Kaw
425063,"Originally ""Platinum Blond"" was named ""Gallagher"" after the character played by Loretta Young, who also had top billing.  But when the studio realized they had a mega star in Harlow, Young was demoted, only by title not billing.  At the time Young was a bigger star than Harlow.  From all reports Young and Harlow got along famously, no diva quarrels on set, for both were down-to-earth actors.  Harlow is definitely sexy in the movie, but she is terribly miscast and her acting leaves much to be desired.  Young is quite good as Gallagher; her acting was always unappreciated for her luminous beauty always seemed to get in the way.  No about it, the true beauty in this film is Young.  In every frame she's in, she steals the scene, not because of her acting, but she intuitively knows the power of her beauty.  Just watch her, there's a stillness about her that is remarkable, a kind of minimalist acting that is astounding in that you eye naturally goes to her.  It's sad that Harlow died only two years after making this film.  Young, however, went on to have a glorious, legendary Hollywood career, culminating in her winning the Academy Award for her role in ""The Farmer's Daughter.""  She later had the courage to take on TV, and there was no bigger star on TV, except for Lucille Ball.  Who can ever forget Young swirling through the door every week in a designer gown by Jean Louis, her future husband, by the way. I'm glad to see that because of the new book, ""The Star Machine,"" Young's career is now being reevaluated.  She indeed made some fine films.  And she is a better actress than critics have give her credit for.  As for her beauty:  she is one of the most beautiful women to grace the silver screen.  The camera loved her face.  The photographer Hurrell captured her beauty in many portraits, but the one I favor is the cover of ""The Star Machine"":  she and Tyrone Power together.  Classic Hollywood photography.  It's Capra's first film, and it's a very good one.  For Young and Harlow fans it's a must see.",Platinum Blonde VHS
1185993,"I can understand, and do truly empathize with the people here who purchased the individual season-by-season packs of this show. There is an unspoken and unofficial understanding between consumers and DVD companies that if they release these season-by-season packs, then they will do it completely, and usually also release a full boxed set once the run is complete for those who didn't buy the individuals. HIT chose not to go that way, and that sucks big time. However, that said, the discs in this set are great. There is ample bonus material, and they didn't leave anything out. However, I also echo some consumer complaints here about the packaging. These kinds of packaging schemes are very annoying, and this one is near the top in annoyance factor. The way it is, you can't really set it in a library in any good way. The front is just a plastic inset that fits inside the box, so if you stand it up to face out, that plastic feels really loose. So, ditch the box you say? Well, not really, since the binder that the DVDs are actually in has an odd moulded shape to it, and wouldn't ""feel"" right just laying around naked and alone. Another case of the art/marketing department run amok, with no real sense for practicality. It actually kind of makes you not want to get them out and watch them, because it's such a hassle. Bad form HIT. That and the cardboard sleeves (as others have said) have a bad habit of letting the DVDs just slip out and rattle around. On second thought, I was going to give this 4 stars, but after writing this I'm changing it to 3.

There are brilliant moments that linger in your mind well after leaving the theater. The casting seems fine. I've not heard whatever complaints there were from the fanboys, if any. The screenplay is flawed. Though, I have no idea how it could have been better and still remained as dedicated to the source material. Couldn't things have moved along at a better pace (for non-fans too)? Well, for my part, well over an hour-maybe hour and a half- into this and it still felt like things were just starting. As for the plot, it's absurd. There are maybe one or two maybe three ""good guys"" but they can't make a difference, can they? And they all have problems. If you think something good or at least necessary was done at the end, you are morally lost my friend. I'm glad in our universe we don't have and do not need superheroes, especially ones like these.

1207097,"THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT ""DEAD LIKE ME - THE COMPLETE COLLECTION"", 9 DISK SETSo my wife and I started watching Dead Like Me on Video On Demand, and were both so caught up in it that we didn't want to wait for the second season to be made available that way... so we ordered the box set.The box set *includes* ""Life After Death"", the movie MGM made in 2008.Let me start with the DVDs of the ShoTime TV series:Disks 1 through 4 contain the series pilot, and the 14 episodes of season 1.Disks 5 through 8 contain the 15 episodes of season 2 and the bonus features for the series.Up through here, that's 5 stars. If I could have give 6, I would.Disk 9... contains the straight-to-DVD movie.If you're interested in DLM and reading this review (and the many others), I don't have to tell much about the series - they stand firm as they always did, in high, widescreen quality, uncensored and uncut (and the bonus features contain a bunch of deleted scenes and other fun stuff about the series.The movie, though. Oh dear lord, the movie.The movie was made to appeal to an audience that is not in the know about what DLM is about - so the first 15, 20 minutes are an introduction (with cuts from the series), done in comic-book style, with Georgia Lass (Ellen Muth) narrating about what the premise of the story is. After the introductions are done, we're introduced to a flaky storyline about Rube (Mandy Patinkin, direly missed in the movie) having gotten his light, and having been replaced by a Cameron Kane (played by Henry Ian Cusick), who... has... some sort of agenda, plan, whatever, and uses the merry band of reapers to... cause chaos... or something, by having them mess up their reaps.Hm.The role of Daisy Adair was performed by Sarah Wynter, who - I'm sure - is a great actress... just not a great Daisy. The series' last episodes had gone through great lengths to turn Daisy into someone with a secret that's eating her, a seemingly callous but very human, confused and hurt woman, who warmed up with every episode, showed fear, love and understanding.In the movie, however, Daisy is a callous, uninteresting, selfish, vulture-like and petty wanna-be actress, with no depth, no heart and no struggle. One of the bonus features actually tried to explain away the Daisy part, but regardless of the reasons, it was painful to watch, and did not do the part of Daisy Adair any justice - better they had had her ""get her light"", just like Rube. Callum, Ellen and Jasmin Guy could have carried it off by themselves...... or maybe they just shouldn't have bothered at all.The storyline about the relation between George and Reggie (Britt McKillip) was done nicely, and actually allows for some feeling of closure.My initial plan was to get the series, and rent the movie to see if it was worth buying.If you buy this box, the movie is included... but if you already have the series, and consider yourself a hardcore DLM fan, do not bother with the movie. It felt like it was thrown together in a hurry (and the fact that *neither* of the writers of the movie had been involved with the series shows, big time), and feels more like an extended ""crap, we need a finale"" episode than anything else...Aside from the Reggie/George interaction, the only good things about the movie were:1. We finally got to see Murray the cat2. The very, very last scene, after some consideration (had to sink in for a moment).My wife and I... we'll toss in the series, every now and then, for a DLM marathon session... the movie will remain in its box, though. It's part of the set, but as far as we're concerned... only to keep the outside box from being too wide for the series' DVDs.And that's why the product gets only 4 stars... I'm not averaging (the movie would make the average be negative, and that's no good) because the series and bonus features are excellent, as expected. The movie just... takes it down a notch. Sad, but true.",N/A

391269,"Hilariously cornball, shamelessly manipulative, unforgivably hoary, indigestible remake of Alessandro Blasetti's 1942 Italian film ""Four Steps in the Clouds"" features enough stock characters and phony dialogue to overload a half-dozen more movies. WWII-era GI returns home to an indifferent wife; disillusioned, he hits the road to California by train, meeting a troubled, unmarried Italian miss on his journey. The train lurches suddenly and the two fall to the floor (in the missionary position!); she stands up and vomits on his uniform (cue to the audience: she's either got motion-sickness or she's pregnant...my guess would be the latter). He volunteers to temporarily pose as her husband once she returns to her hot-tempered Italian brood nestled deep in the valley on a Northern California vineyard estate (""It's called 'The Clouds'!""); naturally, leaving the forlorn beauty the next night proves to be difficult for the young soldier. ""Her father said the gringo would leave her,"" the grandpa tells him, ""And he will whip her with it!"" What exactly does this mean, and what kind of a father has this woman got, anyway? Keanu Reeves, blinking blankly with a slack expression, is such a terrible actor, he can't even look at the family spread and exclaim ""It's beautiful!"" without sounding insincere.

157579,"John Milius' vision of the Dillinger legend is great for action buffs, but historians seeking factual accuracy may find this hard to take. Warren Oates closely resembles Johnnie, but the gregariousness and charisma of the bank-robbing legend is lost in this rendition. We've also got a gun-wielding Billie Frechette (Michelle Phillips), a cowardly Baby Face Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) and a macho thug-killing Melvin Purvis that makes this ever harder to swallow. Don Johnson's Pretty Boy Floyd is one of the few likeable characters but, alas, not enough scenes or lines in this rickety follow-up to Lawrence Tierney's similarly fact-flawed crime classic of the same name.This is as testosterone-fueled as it is adrenaline-charged. We stumble back and forth between Dillinger and Purvis' scenes of goonery into bloody shootouts that give us pause to consider that the two men are more alike than the media has portrayed them. There's no one in the movie that one can really sympathize with, except for Pretty Boy Floyd, himself a two-dimensional character at best.

35201,"The Nightmare on Elm Street series has been one of the most popular horror franchises in horror film history Startingly brilliantly with the unforgettable debut motion picture ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". The first one is a wonderful and bloody psychological horror fantasy written, created and directed by Wes Craven better known for his infamous sleaze-feast from 1972 ""Last House on The Left"" and the 1977 gritty masterpiece ""The Hills Have Eyes"" came up with a very original concept for a horror movie based on bizarre actual incidents and childhood memories of a creepy old neighborhood man. The idea went to New Line Cinema as Robert Shaye (CEO of the studio) approved the film then after teh film was done it was unleashed in november of 1984 where it became the hit film that saved the low budget studio from brankruptacy and became critically acclaimed for it's unique and imaginative concept that no other horror filmmaker has done before. Like ""Halloween"", ""Black Christmas"", ""Twich of the Death Nerve (a.k.a. Bay of Blood)"", ""Phantasm"" ""Suspiria"", and ""Friday The 13th"" including ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" before NOES 1 turned into a revolutionary slasher horror epic that no one expected and introduced audiences to Freddy Krueger whom is brilliantly played by Robert Englund who later became a big time movie star thanks to this movie and even heroine Nancy Thompson played by Heather Langenkamp became a cult actress icon. The original movie marked the debut of Johnny Depp before he became a big TV and movie star, the special effects in the original movie still frighten and hold up well including some the surreal imagery for Freddy Krueger has ranked with the likes of Michael Myers, The Tallman, Jason Voorhees, and Leatherface but unlike those guys this fellow was formerly a pedophile/child murderer who murdered a dozen children in the town of Springwood Ohio then the angry parents hunted him down then torched him to death where years later he returned back as an evil entity who dons a brown fedora, a green-red sweater, has horribly burnted skin and has razor sharp knives on a glove for a weapon as he haunts children and teens in their dreams then literally kills them in them for the victims die for real too. Hell even Freddy Krueger and the series spawned merchandise, trick or treaters as Freddy, parodies, TV appearences with Freddy, a TV spin-off series and a big pheneomeon.After ""NOES"" became a crowdpleasing success with audiences and critics alike, fans of the genre demanded for a sequel so then their wish was their command. Then came ""Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge"" which debuted in november of 1985 is definitely the low point of the franchise as this is the worst movie of the series, despite it's good idea of being set five years after the original where a teen boy named Jesse (Mark Patton) moves into the house where Nancy used to live as now Freddy returns to possess the kid but gets so wasted by horrible acting and some illogical stuff like exploding lovebirds. This movie is infamous as the ""Gay Elm Street"" movie for it has so much homoerotic overtones that you don't know where to begin even with the S&M; club scene though Jessie's girlfriend played by Kim Meyers is a hot redhead babe here nothing could save this disaster dispite the cool opening nightmare sequence. Now onward to part 3 known as ""The Dream Warriors"" is definitely the greatest sequel of the franchise yet! thanks to a screenplay by Wes Craven with co-writers Frank Darabont (""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"") with director Chuck Russell (""The Blob"" and ""The Mask"") they brought the series back on it's feet after the awful part 2 nearly crippled it as this one is set a year after that movie as an insomeniac beautiful blonde girl named Kirsten (Patrica Arquette) who is sent to a psychiatric ward after a nightmare by Freddy nearly made her commit suicide. Over there she meets up with other kids that had similar experiences with their dreams for Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) returns as she wants to help the poor kids to become dream warriors to fight against the bastard son of a hundred maniacs. This installment is the most satisfying because of it's interesting material, twist in the end, great acting, dark sense of humor and imaginative special effects as it marks this installment as a winner all the way.""NOES 4: The Dream Master"" became the third highest grossing movie of the franchise when it hit theaters in August of 1988. It's another great installment has Freddy resurrected a year after ""Dream Warriors"" as he kills off the last of the remaining Elm Street children, now a hot redheaded girl named Alice (Lisa Wilcox) noticing some of her friends being killed one by one as she gains their dream powers mysteriously as she must fight off Freddy. This installment is another wonderous sequel thanks to Finnish director Renny Harlin (""Exorcist The Beginning"" and ""Die Hard 2"") for it has a wicked sense of humor, menace, good kills, great special effects and neat nightmares like the disturbing Pizza of souls and the girl becoming a bug sequence that is not for weak stomaches. Next ""The Dream Child"" which takes place a year after ""Dream Master"" for the beautiful Alice has been impregneated by her boyfriend and recently graduated high school thinks life will be great to have a child and future husband. But when her boyfriend dies in a horrible accident when he fell asleep, she starts to suspect that Freddy Krueger is back as indeed he is for now the cretin wants her unborn child to be the barrier for all the victims he kills including some of her buddies for now she must save her child with the help of Freddy's mother. A weak entry but still better then the wretched part 2 is not as brilliant as parts 1 and 3 nor as good as part 4, it still has some bizarre atmosphere with gothic elements and fun kills like a comic book geek getting what's coming to him but the film is basically a redux of ""Rosemary's Baby"" with Freddy as the star even though there is an interesting background on Freddy's mother and his birth.""Freddy's Dead The Final Chapter"" was intended to be the last chapter of Freddy's cinematic adventures but it's not really. The story is set 10 years after ""Dream Child"" as every child and teen in Springwood has been eliminated no thanks to Krueger for an orphaned teen boy who is the last surviving teen from the town becomes a pawn in Freddy's trap to find more teenagers to make him stronger, he goes into a troubled teen clinic where a psychiatrist (Lisa Zane) finds out that Freddy had a child as she must find out who this child is to put an end to Freddy once and for all. This is a fun and somewhat silly installment that has cool special effects, an awesome 3-D climatic sequence in 10 minutes, dark humor with Freddy's usual witty lines and an interesting background on Freddy's history. And finally ""New Nightmare"" is the most unsual but most ingenius of the sequels besides part 3 as it deals when reel life meets reality for Heather Langenkamp plays as herself who is offered to play Nancy for one last time in a 10th anniversary reunion movie of the Elm Street series with Robert Englund (who plays both himself and Freddy Krueger) but Heather starts to notice weird things going on like bizarre killings of her husband and some filmmakers in hollywood, Freddy-esque prank calls, her son acting not very normal and a few Earthquakes as it seems a demon from the underworld disguising as Freddy Krueger wants to kill her and her child (Miko Huges) for she must play Nancy Thompson again to stop this cruel monster. It doesn't really set itself from the film continuity of parts 1 to 6 but rather it's own standalone installment with a great concept thanks to writer-director Wes Craven who uses the idea of a movie within a movie about a movie concept with some of the actors playing themselves.The films also star John Saxton (parts 1, 3, New Nightmare), Tuesday Knight (Part 4 and New Nightmare), Nick Corri (part 1 and New Nightmare), Lawrence Fishburne (part 3), Zsa Zsa Gabor (part 3), Dick Cavett (part 3), Johnny Depp (part 1 and Freddy's Dead), Linda Shaye (parts 1 and New Nightmare), Robert Shaye (New Nightmare, Freddy's Dead and part 4), Wes Craven (""New Nightmare""), Clu Cluger (part 2), Breckin Meyer (Freddy's Dead), Tom and Rosanne Arnold (Freddy's Dead), Alice Cooper (Freddy's Dead), and Yaphett Kotto (Freddy's Dead). This is a unique kind of horror franchise that combines gore, surrealism and imaginative with some dark themes to them! the boxset here contains all 7 remastered Elm Street movies with great picture and sound quality. ""Freddy's Dead"" here in this boxset is presented with both 2-D and 3-D versions complete with two pairs of 3D glasses and there's two audio commentaries on Nightmare 1 and New Nightmare with an 8th disc that is amazing as it has an interactive maze where you point and click some things including solving puzzles to unlock the mysteries of this franchise with a collectable booklet. There's even a documentary before you enter the labyrinth called ""Welcome to PrimeTime"" that is a documentary on the first Nightmare then when you enter the maze you will find some neat stuff like still and photo galleries, merchandise galleries, interviews, featurettes on each installment, TV appearences of Freddy Krueger, music videos and even trailers to each movie. I strongly recommend getting this boxset for every horror fan and i also recommend ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" in addition to the boxset to conclude the saga of Freddy Krueger.",N/A

851927,"This DVD is GREAT!!!My favorite part of this DVD is disc 2.I watched the episode when Ash helped a man with a Noctowl in the episode Throwing in the Noctowl, the episode when Ash earned his mineral badge by beating Jasmine in a gym battle called the Nerves of Steelix, and the episode when Ash and his arch-rival Gary were on a race in the episode Extreme Pokemon. Gary Oak is a moron because Ash hates Gary, but believe it or not Ash beat Gary in the race in this episode.Best of all I watched this episode An Egg Sighting Adventure, when Ash was looking for his pokemon egg and Misty decided to help Ash, then Officer Jenny helped Ash through out the middle of this episode. At the end a Kangaskhan gave control of the egg, because Team Rocket stole it at the first place, Kangaskhan challenged Team Rocket, and returned it back to Ash.An Egg Sighting Adventure is such a great episode.

The best thing about this film is the spectacular special effects, especially the water creature and the mice. They look life like. There is some good humor too. For example, when the cat was tied up by the mice. The fighting scenes are realistic and exciting. The sword fighting between Peter and King Miraz is tense and engaging.The big problem is it has very little dialogues. That does not help me connecting with the characters.

During that time, I was lazy and always late; disappointing my professors and yes, even employers. I was brilliant but couldn't quite pull it together. It's nice to be reminded of an actual personal connection I had to a superhero character.I'm tempted to make an erectile dysfunction joke about Toby Maguire losing his powers but that isn't the right metaphor so I won't.Spider-Man 2 has uncommonly witty, intentionally funny dialogue for the comic book movie genre. Here are some of my favorite exchanges:Peter: ""I've been reading poetry lately.""Mary Jane: ""Whatever that means.""Miss Brant: ""Sir, your wife's on the line, she said she lost her checkbook.""J.

1284306,"In the Sci-Fi/thriller/horror genre, this film is sort of a diamond in the rough as I think this movie's theatrical debut was much overlooked. Kind of reminded me of ""Event Horizon"" (1997), though I can see where the movie also borrowed from ""The Matrix"" (1999) in the development of the ""sleeping capsules"" and tube-style feeding machines, and the creatures looked very similar to those in ""The Descent"" (2005) but with technology adaptations. That's okay though, most movies borrow from each other anyway.I give it 3-stars because the movie was rather slow-going in the beginning and it didn't really gain my interest until we were about in the last third of the film. This is one you have to sit through to get the pay-off at the end of the film. Plus, I have seen my fair share of ""the last remaining humans"" fighting for humanity and attempting to destroy the creatures that threaten humanity, so the whole middle third of the movie which dealt with that theme and was little more than an action film something like ""The Blade"" (1998) didn't really interest me. Though perhaps if you haven't seen as many films as I have, you might find it unique or enjoyable.However, the last third of the movie was quite entertaining and really makes it worth watching the film. There are a couple of twists at the end, no spoilers here, watch it for yourself!Final Grade: B-",Pandorum
1097558,"Driftwood (Tim Sullivan, 2006)Sullivan (2001 Maniacs) actually had a lot of potential with this script, co-written with Chris Kobin; it's a supernatural-themed mystery set in the Florida swamplands. Potential being the key word, as some bad casting choices and a lack of one more tightening rewrite leave the finished product feeling somewhat bland.David Forrester (Phil of the Future's Raviv Ullman) is sent to an ""attitude adjustment facility"" housed in an abandoned prison by his parents after the death of his brother (The Rules of Attraction's Russell Sams). Said facility is run by a trio of demented individuals. There's the warden, Kennedy (pro wrestler Diamond Dallas Page), his sadistic right-hand man Norris (Sex and the City's David Eigenberg), and a psychologist (Seabiscuit's Lou Beatty, Jr.) who provides hard evidence for the idea that all psychologists are in desperate need of help themselves. Then there are the kids in David's block, who range from a quiet, friendly kid sent there to cure his homosexuality to a twitchy school shooter. David, like his fellow inmates, is put to work clearing the grounds and doing gardening at the warden's place. No one complains much thanks to Myra (Frostbite's Baelyn Neff), Kennedy's gorgeous daughter, who seems to take a shine to David. David soon finds that the place is haunted, and eventually comes to realize that he--and the guys who are fast becoming his friends--may never leave the facility alive unless he figures out what the ghost wants from him.So much potential. So very much. But running another set of eyes over the script would have been a great idea. Someone might have caught a really nasty inconsistency in Myra's character, not to mention a few plot threads and pieces of character-building that could have been built on to make this a much more solid film. In fact, prison dramas of this style often turn on the relationships between the prisoners themselves. We get a little of that, but not nearly enough for us to get to know most of the inmates. We could have gotten it, and it would have made this a much better film. But the big failing here, which somehow doesn't surprise me in the least, is Dallas Page. He comes off as a sort of cross between a pro wrestler (that's a stretch) and a demented drill sergeant. He's got one emotion, and he works it to its last nerve, and far beyond. (This does provide some opportunities for--possibly intentional--humor, such as an interrupted love scene with his boss.) Still, despite all its shortcomings, the strength of the premise, as well as some hints of what this movie could have been, should be enough to get you to watch it if your taste for the macabre runs more to the atmospheric than the gore-drenched. ** ",N/A
337946,"It's Alive (Larry Cohen, 1973)What is there to say about It's Alive that hasn't already been said? Cohen (Air Force One: The Final Mission)'s fourth film is one of the most popular and enduring cult films of all time. It's a touching story about the bond between a father and his psychotic, murderous infant.Frank (The Postman Always Rings Twice's John Ryan) and Lenore (Night of the Comet's Sharon Farrell) Davies are expecting their first child, and as we open, the blessed event is about to take place. When Lenore gives birth, however, the child is deformed. And hungry. And has a thing for human blood. The rest of the film concerns Frank and the police trying to track the infant as it leaves a trail of bodies through suburban Los Angeles.With a Bernard Hermann score and Rick Baker effects, you know this ain't Rosemary's Baby. Cohen was going for the gut from moment one, as usual, and everyone involved in the production was right on board with that idea. This is melodrama with just enough gore to keep seventies-era gorehounds happy. These days, the big plot twist at the end is going to look like a clich&eacute;, but it wasn't all that normal back in the day. (It does, however, reference an obvious film that had been released a few years back; which one will be obvious if you go back and re-read this review so far.)

1288684,"The two really great films that the Marx Brothers did after they left Paramount were ""A Night at the Opera"" (the best IMHO) and ""A Day at the Races"". These two have Margaret Dumont sparring with Groucho as usual.  ""Races"" and ""Opera"" were the two films that boy genius Irving Thalberg supervised after personally wooing the Marx's to come to MGM in the first place. Louis B. Mayer really had no use for the brothers, and it shows in the kinds of films they were given after Thalberg died in 1936. The best of the Marx Brothers are what they did at Paramount, still with us inThe Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection (The Cocoanuts / Animal Crackers / Monkey Business / Horse Feathers / Duck Soup). The Marx Brothers were iconoclasts at heart, and after the production code began to be enforced they really had no home in motion pictures. I think Irving Thalberg was wrong to think that the problem was that the brothers never helped anyone in their movies, but the formula he came up with in ""Opera"" and ""Races"" did make their comedy work in the age of the code.""At the Circus"" and ""A Night in Casablanca"" are OK. On the bright side ""At the Circus"" has Margaret Dumont. On the not so bright side it is infected with musical numbers that are, quite frankly, boring. ""A Night in Casablanca"" almost gets the boys back to the quality they had in the mid 30's under Thalberg, so it is worthwhile viewing, although it does lend a generosity to the boys that simply does not fit their brand of humor.""Room Service"" (1938) is actually an RKO film, so for once no musical numbers. This script was not written especially for the brothers, it was one of the few films they did with adapted material. The humor is OK, but it just doesn't seem like a Marx Brothers film.In my opinionThe Marx Brothers Collection (A Night at The Opera/A Day at The Races/A Night in Casablanca/Room Service/At the Circus/Go West/The Big Store)is a more complete picture of the film career of the Marx Brothers after the code. It has plenty of extra features and it is often on sale for about the same price as this set, plus you get seven films, not just four.",TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Marx Brothers (A Day at the Races / A Night in Casablanca / Room Service / At the Circus)

653463,"It is called the All Spark. Powerful. Incredible. Able to create robotic life and destroy it just as quickly.On Cybertron, a planet far, far away, a war arose when a robot named Megatron, leader of the Decepticons, wanted the power of the All Spark for himself. Optimus Prime and his band of Autobots rose up against him and their battle destroyed their homeworld, sending the cube-shaped All Spark into space.Lost.The Autobots and Decepticons scoured the galaxy looking for it, knowing that whoever found it first would be the victor and would decide the fate of not just one world, but the universe.The All Spark found its way to Earth, but not before Megatron tracked it there. It landed in the Arctic, and Megatron was frozen there until found later on by Captain Witwicky, explorer.Decades later, his grandson, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), needs a car and after visiting a used-car dealer ends up coming home with an old Chevy Camaro. Little does he know the car is more than meets the eye and lurking beneath its yellow shell is an Autobot named Bumblebee. It's not long till Sam finds out and is thrust into a robotic world where two teams of giant robots compete to find the All Spark.Joining Sam is his high school crush, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), whom reluctantly is dragged on this journey with him but soon finds herself getting interested in this guy who she barely knew existed.It's robot vs robot in this giant epic of good vs evil, fireballs, bullets and vehicles that are more than meets the eye.What can I say? When I heard they were taking the Transformers from my childhood and lifting them from the cartoon to ""real life,"" I was ecstatic. I was also concerned because I knew it'd take a crazy amount of CGI to make it happen, and not just any CGI either--good CGI. The last thing I wanted was for a bunch of cartoony robots with rubbery parts dominating the screen.Boy, was I shocked when I saw Bumblebee transform and tower over all, shining his spotlight into the sky, or when Optimus Prime showed up and that glorious digital transformation sound roared and he stood proud, huge and detailed.This stuff was real, and it looked like the makers of this movie actually made real Autobots and Decepticons to make it happen.Good times.Storywise, yeah, I liked it. The alien invasion thing worked. Very well done. Same with the notion that, unlike the cartoons (from what I recall), the Autobots had a vow of secrecy to keep themselves hidden from the humans while they searched for the All Spark.Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky was funny, same with Kevin Dunn as his father.The story also bodes well for a sequel, which has now come and gone, with more stories in the works. If you're going to go epic, like Transformers did, you're going to need more than one. Last I heard, they're doing 5 or 6 of these things. Me? I'm all for it. I go into these things expecting a good time and not some life-altering film where, years later, I look back and see it as a turning point for me. Transformers is just that: a good time, and one that tickled my inner fanboy.More than meets the eye? You betchya!A.P. Fuchs",Transformers
1315311,"Amelia is a pretty standard issue bio-pic. The story is told as Amelia makes the last journey with Fred Noonan to find Howland Island. Amelia Earhart was a pioneer of aviation when flying was still dangerous, when airplanes crumpled like kites, and only to be undertaken by adventurous men. Although, for a while women's  aviation was competitive with men's aviation, since engines and machines even up the playing field.The story is pretty much about the adult Amelia Earhart (Hilary Swank), although we're shown a young Amelia become enthralled with flying upon seeing her first barnstormer. Earhart's accomplishments are pretty much hit on in this film. The first woman to fly across the Atlantic, as a passenger, winning a cross country air race, her meeting with and falling in love with G.P. Putnam (Richard Gere) who made her a celebrity. The film makes it clear Earhart was uncomfortable with that celebrity endorsing a cigarette brand when she didn't smoke, luggage, a clothes line, a waffle iron, all that was missing was a perfume. It's clear that Earhart was not only a pioneer in the air but in the area of celebrity endorsements, and that status chaffed at her. In her eyes, her accomplishments were diminished by having to be only a passenger on that first trans-Atlantic flight. Putnam made a her feel like a ""white horse jumping through hoops"" but rationalized that it was necessary to fund her wanderlust of the skies.Also detailed is her setting up with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) the first airline shuttle within the United States, again, for this business venture Earhart allows herself to be used as a figurehead to attract business for Vidal's airline. Earhart also meets Vidal's son the future writer Gore Vidal, who even at a young age it seems was proposing alternative lifestyles.Earhart wanted to erase all doubts about skills as an aviator (aviatrix in the parlance of the day), that she was more ambition than accomplishment, and undertakes to circumnavigate the globe, which no man had done. Did Earhart undertake this expedition because she was insecure about the circumstances of previous accomplishements?The acting by all the principals is what you would expect of actors of this caliber, there's nothing flashy here, but then the script doesn't really call for it until the end with Earhart and Putnam promising to see each other soon.Of course we all know the outcome of that last flight and the speculation and mystery it's generated since, but this movie doesn't rise up to the level of the mystery or its stars. 3.5 stars",N/A

This was the extent of my knowledge of the film.""Milk"" is a biopic of the life and times of Harvey Milk from the time he moved from New York to San Francisco and his brief political career.  He tried three times and failed to be elected to city government.  On his fourth attempt, he was successful.  In so doing, he became the first openly gay politician to be elected in the United States.  Such an event would not be a big deal today but in the late 1970s it was certainly worth noting.During his time in government, Milk locked horns with Dan White, a man who was as distant from Milk and his lifestyle as would be possible.  It was their differences and White's dismissal that bring the story to its denouement.  Milk and Mayor George Moscone meet a gruesome end.Harvey Milk is played by Sean Penn who, in a loose sense, is also the narrator for much of the film.  Penn is excellent in this role and his reputation should be burnished as a result.  It shows that Penn can really perform in a range of parts and that he not limited to ""tough guy"" type roles.Yet while I found the film quite watchable, it was never able to totally seize my attention.

547105,"Most of the Slasher films can hardly be reviewed as legitimate good films,let alone good Horror films,but there is however a quaint nostaligia given these early 80s gore-fests.The Burning(1981) was one of the first films to embrace the formula featuring many of the ingrediants to build a good Slasher film:Summer camp,promiscuous teens,lots of nudity,a grotesque killer and of course,make-up by Tom Savini.The film is surprisingly entertaining,telling the story of a horrendously burned former caretaker of a Summer Camp who takes revenge on the kids at the camp,five years later,being it was kids who burned him in a prank gone wrong.What sets this film apart from some of it's brethern is that the acting is better than usual and characters are more likeable(including a young Holly Hunter and Jason Alexander) and the heroes being male,which is surprising,in the usually sexist Slasher films.The film has also alot of atmosphere that creates for a fairly creepy experience and one particularly frightening gore piece that takes place in broad daylight.Gore is gross,but excellently concieved by Savini,who creates some truly startling work here on the deaths and the creepy title character.There is also a surprising amount of full frontal female nudity that will surely make the male viewers happy.Still,the film is somewhat ordinary beyond that,even if it is just grindhouse fodder,despite some changes,it's still your typical slasher formula.That ending though is one creepy wrap-up!I'd apply an extra star if your a fan of Slasher and Gore films and detract one if your a film student.The DVD itself is presented nicely with a beautiful letterbox print,a behind the scenes video on the FX of the movie,hosted by Savini and a Trailer.Fun film for the Gore enthusiast.",N/A

876587,"Having long been intrigued by the tale of Edward VIII, the English king who gave up the throne to be with the woman he loved an American divorc&eacute;e named Wallis Simpson imagine my surprise at discovering that there existed this miniseres. Not only was there a miniseries about the subject but that one of my favorite actors (Edward Fox) was playing the famed King himself. The result is a rather grand, if slightly overlong, historical drama.As in the case of many a historical drama, the cast is fine one. Edward Fox gives one of the finest performances of his career as the famed King Edward VIII from the dashing playboy Prince Of Wales to the man who gives up the throne for the woman he loves. Cynthia Harris gives a nice performance as the woman he loved Wallis Simpson though she does have a tendency to overact. Thankfully both Fox and Harris share a nice chemistry between them that makes them quite convincing as the famed couple.The supporting cast is fine as well. David Waller gives a fine performance as the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin who tires to keep the government together in the midsts of the crisis caused by the title characters as does Peggy Ashcroft as the famed Queen Mary. From Nigel Hawthorne as Edward's friend Walter Monkton to Wensley Pithey as Winston Churchill to Charles Keating as Wallis husband Ernest Simpson to Marius Goring and Patrick Troughton as opposition leader Clement Attlee the cast is a fine one and makes this drama well worth seeing.Things are strong behind the camera as well. The sets by Allan Cameron and the costumes by Jennie Tate perfectly capture the spirit of the 1930's in which this famed story took place. The score and opening song by Ron Grainer also captures the atmosphere of the 1930's as well. Even better, the script by Simon Raven (from the biography Edrward VIII by Frances Donaldson) is a true highlight. With its attention to details and events the script gives a detailed study of a royal romance that doesn't quite end happily. The dialouge in particular makes the production stand out and gives the whole production an epic quality thanks to the wonderful direction of Waris Hussein.If the miniseries has any fault it is that it seems overlong. At seven fifty minute episodes (or right around six hours) it feels as though it could have been trimmed down at times. There aren't many slow moments in the miniseries but one wonders if those scenes trimmed could have made Edward & Mrs. Simpson slightly shorter.Despite is length Edward & Mrs. Simpson is a fine drama. From its two leading actors to the supporting cast, production values, direction and writing this is a fine example of the art of the miniseries. For fans of fine historical dramas look no further then Edward & Mrs. Simpson.",N/A

The animals and scenery are beautiful. The characters are believable and the acting superb. With all the medical, CSI & Reality TV on the air, it's nice to sit down to a well made family drama.

1222701,"From the ""We're Disney, we don't need Pixar everytime we do animation!"", comes a film that disproves that theory in the CGI filled 00's. Sure, at times it's looks like a Pixar film circa ""A Bug Life"", but that was over ten years ago. Sure, my 10 year old was entertained, but when a person that age isn't ""blown away"" with the first viewing you know you got a middle-of-the-road CGI flix. Bolt (an unrecognizable John Travolta) is a dog, similar to Lassie thru James Bond, that has his own TV show where he saves his young female owner (voiced by Miley Cyrus, who sounds like she needs to lay off the two-packs-a-day of Virginia Slims) from evil trying to destroy them. But Bolt doesn't know that he's just an actor and thru a typical plot point of getting sent hundreds of miles away from the one he loves to try to find a way back to her while learning the hard truths of who he really is along the way. Also lending a voice was surprisingly Susie Essman of Curb Your Enthusiasm who I kept expecting to say ""What's the f&*%$*' a matter with you Dog?"". Another thing I noticed is alot of gags seem to be borrowed from alot of other films and TV shows, most noticeably the New York pigeons that looked straight out of '90's Warner Bros Goodfeathers cartoon, which seemed more rip-off than homage. And of course you have the goof character Rhino The Hamster, rolling ball and all that helps with the lack of original lines & sight-gags along the way. Overall, this will pass the time with the younger generation but I doubt they'll be screaming for multiple viewings over WALL+E or even Kung Fu Panda. The one-disc version has the typical Disney ""look, we still have other retread stuff"" promos and a short film starring Rhino that you'll see coming a mile away, and way too short to boot (even for a short!). A decent rental, but like what the pigeons say, ""I've seen this dog somewhere before, but where?"" you'll be thinking the exact same thing.(RedSabbath Rating:7.0/10)",Bolt

I didn't turn over to go to sleep until the movie was over.  It just grabbed me from the start.  The weapons weren't too unrealistic (given it's in the future) and the action was on the same level of a Transformers movie.

882268,"This Ealing comedy shot in a London still bearing the scars of World War Two features some warhorses of British theater and cinema including Stanley Holloway and Margaret Rutherford.Pimlico is a part of London near the Thames just below Victoria Station. The story begins when an unexploded bomb dropped by the Germans ignites in a deep hole, revealing a stache of medieval treasures and a rare document. It turns out that King Edward IV  bequeathed the small area to the Duke of Burgundy in the 15th  century -- and since that gift was never revoked, the street is actually Burgundian territory.In a Britain still laboring under wartime rationing, the idea of setting up a tax-free shopping zone soons draws mobs of people to Pimlico. The government institutes a blockade -- the plucky Burgundians vow to stand firm.It's all good natured and amusing, especially Rutherford's performance as a dotty old history professor.

1264375,"When this popped up in my Netflix queue, I was excited because I'm quite an Austen fanatic, and have most of the DVDs of the various adaptations. I had never watched this particular BBC adaptation, and so was eager to watch it before purchasing it. I found this to be a tepid adaptation of Austen's classic and the worst of all the adaptations. My ranking of the various adaptations of Sense and Sensibility as as follows:The movie version starring Emma Thompson (1995) - there's nothing I dislike about this adaptation:)Sense and Sensibility (BBC, 2008 - haunting score, beautiful cinematography, faithful in most respects, and excellent casting, especially the role of Elinor, which was played by Hattie Morahan)Sense and Sensibility (BBC, 1981 - very faithful to the novel, but the actors are not very appealing)This 1971 BBC adaptation is truly pathetic - the acting by some of the characters seem over the top, and the portrayal of Sir John was truly annoying. The actor playing Willoughby was the least attractive of all the Willoughby's in the various adaptations and I felt he was horribly miscast. The actors playing the sisters, Elinor and Marianne were well-cast, especially the character of Elinor, portrayed by Joanna David, who coincidentally went on to play Elizabeth Bennet's (Jennifer Ehle) aunt in the iconic 1996 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Joanna David's Elinor is sweet and sensible, and shines in her role. The other notable actor was Patricia Routledge as Mrs Jennings. Routledge went on to attain fame in her role as the pompous Mrs Bucket in ""Keeping Up Appearances"".The feature itself runs about 3 hours, and there are some changes in the dialogue compared to Austen's novel. The props and setting give this production the appearance of being a theater production, and some of the actors appear stilted and awkward in their roles. I think I will still purchase this, if only because I wish to have a collection of all the various adaptations of Austen's works, but I have to say that this is the worst adaptation of Sense and Sensibility compared to the others I have viewed.",Sense and Sensibility
345098,"Probably one of the biggest critical failures in the history of motion pictures, ""Sliver"" centers around a woman (played by Sharon Stone) who moves into a highrise apartment in downtown Manhattan when suddenly many tenants start to get murdered. The owner of the buliding (played by William Baldwin) experiments with voyeuism by videotaping the goings on in the tenant's apartments. The movie is pretty much forgotten today, but many do remember the film for the extreme amount of sex scenes between Stone and Baldwin as well as the amount of male nudity Baldwin shows; in the original cut of the film there was even a frontal shot of his body. The film is pretty empty on plot, but buy the film if you want to see the gorgeous body of William Baldwin; he is not shy in showing his assets. Despite the critical failure of the movie ""Sliver"" grossed over $166,000,000 at the boxoffice. The DVD has no bonus features but comes in widescreen.

1012898,"This movie has it's good points and not so good points regarding (1) the main characters, (2) the supporting characters and (3) the overall storyline.1 -- the main charactersVince Vaughn -- this is the funniest I've seen Vaughn (second best was his role in Swingers).  I especially loved the scene where his girlfriend accuses him of being bitter that her brother kicked his a**.  The look on his face as well as his response just cracked me up.Jennifer Aniston -- on the show Friends, I thought Aniston was the funniest female character (and, therefore, couldn't understand why Lisa Kudrow kept winning awards).  But I've noticed that in movies, she doesn't bring the same sparkle she brought to Friends.  Instead, her performances falls flat.  This movie is no exception.  Her acting here is very lethargic.2 -- the supporting charactersJon Favreau -- loved him in Swingers and in this movie as well.  The scene at the end where he's giving Vaughn advice on how to handle Aniston's new love interest is the funniest part in the movie.Cole Hauser -- Hauser normally plays serious roles, but in this movie, proves he can also do comedy.  The scene where he hits on these two women is both creepy and hilarious.Jason Bateman -- I'm a big fan of Bateman.  He's just a natural comedian.  His role in this movie is small, but he still manages to make those scenes funny, too.Justin Long -- I think Long has a very natural, very believable acting style.  In this movie, however, his talents are underused.  Instead, he relies on a weird hairdo and costume to provide all the gags, but they're not even funny.Vincent D'onofrio -- D'onofrio is the only person in this film who seemed really out of place.  His attempts at trying to be funny only made me cringe and feel sorry for him.  He should stick to drama.3 -- the overall storylineThis movie definitely has it's funny moments, however, I have a gripe about the overall storyline.  What bothered me was that the fault of the breakup seemed to rest solely with Vaughn's character.  But I think they were both at fault.Towards the end, when Aniston is blaming him for not giving enough to the relationship, Vaughn makes an important point that he's not a mind reader.  I agree.  Based on his apology at the end, I think had she spoken up, he would've done anything to make her happy.I mean, I could see if she asked him to change and he refused, but she didn't even ask.  Instead she expected him to read her mind and when he failed to do that (because he doesn't have any magical powers), she let her resentment fester to the point where she broke up with him.This seemed really unfair to me and not a good message for women to walk away with.I think a better message would be for Aniston to apologize as well, saying she wished she had spoken up earlier about her unmet needs and because she didn't, it caused her resentment to reach it's boiling point.That would've been refreshing to see.",N/A
135478,"Many of the reviewers that have posted negative comments seem to share the same penchant for the word ""dated"" and employ  it as a tool with which they can easily dismiss Midnight Cowboy among other films.  Without question, some films have stood the test of time better than others.  Mostly those that were products of conservative filmmakers and more mainstream subject matters.  With 1969's Midnight Cowboy, we have neither.  The aesthetic of the film is, without question, heavily influenced by the avant garde art world of 1960's New York; a Warholesque vision of decadence mixed with an almost reverent appreciation for all things urban.  Schlesinger, in my opinion, tried and succeeded in fusing both worlds and created not only a snapshot of a time and place, but a whole sensibility.  But for the record, I'm not at all a fan of the psychedelic camerawork and editing he used throughout the movie.  But with a story as powerful as this, all gripes about the visual style of the film can easily be forgiven.  Most films, though, in one way or another have through the years lost their ability to really make an impact on the public.  We're by far more jaded, cynical, dismissive, but overall sophisticated than audiences were half a century ago and we're certainly not as forgiving. Our collective gullibility and naivet&eacute; died with the Edsel. Comedies have probably faired best, because humor is timeless and what was funny 70 years ago will most certainly be funny today.  Do we need a better example than ""I Love Lucy"" still on TV almost 60 years after it was originally aired on CBS?.  But let's take a quick look at the horror films of Universal Studios golden age.  In a day and age where eye gouging and Achilles tendons are sliced for fun comprise a large part of most contemporary horror movies, does Dracula, Frankenstein or the Wolf Man elicit even a modicum of terror in anyone?  However, does that mean that the aforementioned films aren't, indeed, masterpieces of that genre and wholly worthy of being seen, if for no other reason than to appreciate, among other things, the craftsmanship and performances?  How about another personal favorite of mine, Film Noir.  We're inundated on a daily basis by news and television shows that seemingly revel in the most grotesque aspects of all things criminal, do the villains, femme fatales and other losers that populate Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe's criminal underworld seem remotely threatening to anyone?  How about the street lingo of 1940's America, where every dame had more curves than the Monaco Gran Prix?  Is that even remotely relevant nowadays? But in a film genre that was equal parts style and substance, the art of it is its eternal appeal.  Midnight Cowboy is, simply put, an excellent film, beautifully acted and expertly rendered.  If you are able to get past some of the ""dated"" aspects of the movie, you'll be rewarded with an honest if gritty exploration of the price we pay for our individuality and the true nature of friendship.",N/A
1256139,"Funny how different people see things like this so differently sometimes. The production as a whole is amazing. I have loved Chess its whole life. I saw a touring production several years ago. Frankly the production has gone through so many updates and changes that it hardly resembles that original recording from the 80's. That's fine of course, because Chess still really works. I love Josh Groban, but I disagree that he did a good acting job here. He wasn't the worst by any means, but he had almost no range of emotion in his face, etc. His voice is excellent of course and his ""Anthem"" is awe-inspiring; but his inexperience in acting showed. The ladies were fantastic. No one else is Elaine Page though so we gotta' give that up. I realize that this Florence wasn't to everyone's taste but I actually think she DID show more emotion and genuiness in her delivery of some critical lines. I bought into the dreaminess of her ""great expectations"" and then the devastation at her utter loss (lover, friend, father, etc). I agree 100% that Kerry Ellis was flawless and probably the very best performance. The look on her face when she is telling Anatoly off at the end (""Liar"") is POWERFUL! I'm glad she wasn't looking at me right then.My wife and I agreed that the Arbiter had all of the right mannerisms and attitude, but he was announced at the beginning as the ""sensation from Scotland"" (never heard of him) and then didn't deliver in my opinion; I was looking for a much more powerful and edgy voice for this role - dare I say, flamboyant. Molokov was good, as well as the others. Nothing really stands out in those areas. But I have to comment on the West End Chorus - has there ever been a better use of the chorus? To stand in for the local crowds in Merano was inspired; and the Chorus obviously really got into it. You could tell that they just had a ball. Then near the end when they sing the names of the former chess champions was gorgeous.I really loved this whole production and will be glad to have it in my collection of Chess (joining the original recording, the awful American version, the original Chess program from England a friend brought back to me and my own program from a US tour).

1169237,"The first thing that impressed me about this video is its intelligence.  It's a thinking person's workout.  Exercises are strong on authentic Lotte Berk since that was a significant part of this couple's background, with additions from Pilates, yoga and classical weight training.  They do an excellent job of talking you through the exercises, explaining what it will do for your body, thereby keeping you motivated from a positive place, which is so much nicer than the commonly used negative motivational techniques where somebody is screaming you through a breakneck pace.  They have you concentrate on how your body is feeling the exercise, stopping momentarily if you need to, then picking it up again - instead of counting monotonous repetitions for you.  This approach is so much more pleasant and sensible.  The workout is muscle toning, organized as interval training.  Interval training has been proven by medical research to be much preferred for promoting fat loss and heart reserve capacity, instead of long term cardio.  The pacing promotes the mind-body connection and focus, which reminds me of my ballet training from years ago, or hatha yoga.  You have a chance to breathe and think during the exercises, without feeling additional stress due to the exercising.  Much appreciated after a hectic day at work.The video had a warm, intimate, personal trainer feel to it with the husband and wife team demonstrating the exercises together and instructing by means of a voiceover.  They alternated showing the advanced version of an exercise and clearly indicated which person you should watch if that's the level you wanted.  Setting is what I call ""New Age living room,"" lovely d&eacute;cor, warm earthtones, water feature, and subdued lighting, plenty of camera shots from various angles.  Music so unobtrusive I didn't even notice what it was, although there is a music only option in the special features after you get tired of the instructional.  My husband really liked the fact that a man was showing the exercises also - funny how the same movement can look a little different on a man.  He also liked the fact that it was a husband and wife team instead of a group of women.  We're pressed for time, like to do things together, and this video fills the bill nicely.  No more scheduling TV time for mutually exclusive workouts.  Top quality production, first class all the way.

So, this movie I felt will give them a reality check that everything isn't always what it seems.

1160704,"I purchased this because I like the 1970 original Wizard.I really was hoping to see a new modern twist to ""Wizard of Gore"" and after watching the new remake I felt as though I'd been cheated.I think Crispin Glover makes an excellent creep,but Kip Pardue seemed to take up all the screen time and to me thats a bad thing(not that he's a bad actor)but he just doesn't bode well in horror.As for the rest of the players, Bijou Phillips and Jeffrey Combs and Brad Dourif are solid as usual for the whole 5 minutes you see them.Again Mr.Pardues scenes seem to drag on forever(I want to see more Montag)The gore level was disappointingly low(this is supposedly the WIZARD OF GORE!!!!remake).The CGI was okay in some parts and the makeup was decent,but as I said the CGI was okay in some parts,other parts it was really cheap looking.Don't get me wrong the original Wizard of Gore had cheap sets,cheap lighting,cheap special effects,cheap everthing,but it was great in a way that this remake isn't.I would say it was okay for seeing just once,if your watching this while your doing your taxes.I traded in my copy of this remake the very next day as it was totally unworthy of being in my collection next to the original.My 1 star rating gets a split with 1/2 star for Crispin Glover as Montag and 1/2 star for The Suicide Girls in the nude of artistic fashion,zero stars for everting else. Not worth seeing for the allstar casting alone because Mr. Pardue takes up about 90% of the movie.Go pick up the original,it is so much better and goes for less then half the price of this remake.",The Wizard of Gore
418192,"I was a gawky twelve-year old when this movie was released in 1996. I was negotiating for the first time the treacherous battlefield of middle school hallways: the gossip, the insecurity, and the foreign sensations, the blushing flush of first infatuations. It was a perfect time for me to see this movie. I remember the breathless trailers. Rat-a-tat shots of gang gunplay, adolescent romance, bright colors, and explosions, all backed by a pounding, bass-heavy soundtrack. Suddenly the old Bard of Avon seemed cool.The theater was packed when I went. I recognized some kids from my school. The median age was probably 16. The lights dimmed. The screen flickered. The movie started. And off we went. Here was a world we recognized, a garish world of guns, trendy fashions, and solipsistic teenagers scribbling poetry in their notebooks. The audience snickered with recognition at Romeo's poolside pleading to Juliet, ""Wilst thou leave me so unsatisfied?"" And Juliet's retort, ""What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?"" Gunplay and drug use and raging hormones. Well meaning adults and over-possessive parents. It was so familiar, but heightened, transfused into grand opera.I'm no longer the wide-eyed innocent thrilling to Radiohead b-sides and drooling over Claire Danes (okay, not quite true). So how does the movie hold up? I'll be honest: I can't quite dissociate myself from the movie's nostalgic associations. But I'll try and be objective.What holds up surprisingly well are the performances. The supporting cast is filled out nicely with well-cast veterans and some fresh-faced newcomers. I love John Leguizamo's cocksure Tybalt, all pointy teeth and resin-lined voice. Harold Perrineau (now I can't help but see Michael from LOST!) is a surprisingly affecting as the cross-dressing, drug-dealing misfit, Mercutio. He feeds Romeo a suspicious looking pill (ecstasy? acid?) before the Capulet party, and the results are appropriately trippy.Pete Posthlewaite as Friar Laurence possesses the kind of natural ease with the dialogue that suggests many years of hard-won training on the boards. He wraps his lips around Shakespeare's Gordian knotted language as easily as if he were reading a grocery list--and with a put-on American accent!Since this film DiCaprio has proven himself a worldwide mega-star, headlining such moneymaking behemoths as Titanic and The Departed. Here he captures the passion, the poetry, and the primal rage that imprison Romeo at any given moment. He's a slave to his emotions. He spends his time scrawling poetry in little black books and looking fashionably disaffected. He drops Rosalind in an instant after a one-time encounter with Juliet. He kills Juliet's kin, Tybalt, to revenge his friend's death, his face twisted into a terrible mask of rage. Later, after exile, he dies by his own hand thinking Juliet dead.Ah, Juliet. Claire Danes. Okay, here's where the objectivity becomes difficult. She seemed like the epitome of mysterious older girl sensuality to me when I first saw this movie and now I'm writing from the perspective of someone a few years her senior when she made this movie. Hindsight shows that she doesn't have quite the same grasp and fluidity with the words DiCaprio possesses. What she does have is a winning smile and angelic features and an almost painful sincerity that broke so many hearts on the popular MTV program, ""My So-Called Life.""I believe the Bard himself would like this movie. It has the spirit of the play--the tempestuous first love, the overbearing parents, the head-on collision with fate. It's aggressive and passionate and full of tumbling forward-moving energy. ""Vitality"" is the word Harold Bloom uses to summarize Shakespeare's enduring popularity and I think the adjective applies here. Luhrmann understands that the generation-spanning attraction to Shakespeare isn't always his words, strictly speaking, but rather the intensity and the passion that the words emote. We all know what it's like to be young and in love. Shakespeare gives words to those feelings. And they happen to be better written words than any others in the history of the English language. So what's lost here is the purity of the poetry, but what's gained is a new generations of kids saying, ""Maybe Shakespeare isn't so bad, after all."" They'll discover the poetry in time.",Romeo & Juliet VHS

1262736,"Imagine this: a giant gothic building that serves as a ""sanctuary"" to various strange, freakish and/or dangerous creatures that exist in the world.That's the concept behind ""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season,"" a fantasy/sci-fi show that started off as a series of webisodes, then got turned into a show for the Sci Fi (Sy Fy?) Channel. The first season starts off shaky and sometimes painfully silly (nubbins!), but the second half suddenly smooths itself into a solid arc of secrets, conspiracies, and a fanatical enemy organization.Forensic psychiatrist Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) has a pretty rotten life -- his girlfriend has left, his job is a joke, and nobody believes his deductions. But during a bizarre murder investigation, he encounters a strange woman named Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) who offers him a job at the Sanctuary.The Sanctuary turns out to be a vast cathedral-like structure filled with ""Abnormals"" -- mermaids, elementals, iguana-men, two-faced dudes, or anything that doesn't fall in the boundaries of known science. But the Sanctuary's residents are now in danger from a charming Abnormal named John Druitt (Christopher Heyerdahl), who has a longtime connection to Helen. And unless he gets what he wants from her, he'll kill her daughter Ashley (Emilie Ullerup).Other Sanctuary problems: a trio of amnesiac women who may be the Morrigan, a drug lord among the Folding Men, an autistic boy whose pictures reveal Abnormals, a Himalayan plane crash with a mind-altering monster, a brain parasite in the Bermuda Triangle that threatens to turn Magnus into a psycho killer, the superfertile Nubbins (like carnivorous Totoros), a man who looks suspiciously like Magnus' late father, and a pair of reporters who witness the Sanctuary team fighting rare killer insects. And John Druitt reappears to reveal that an old friend of Helen's has turned against her...And the Sanctuary has a new enemy -- the fanatical Cabal, who want all Abnormals under their control. When they unleash a biological weapon that turns Abnormals into raving killers, Helen's old study group (""The Five"") must reunite to save the Abnormal population.The first half of ""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"" is a severely mixed bag -- most of it isn't really bad, but it's not terribly unique or gripping. And the ""nubbins"" (tribbles with teeth) episode is just embarrassingly silly. But with the introduction of Nicola Tesla (who is a vampire!), suddenly the entire series tightens up and becomes far more streamlined, complex and emotionally powerful.Along the way, the writers fill the series with all sorts of freaky creatures (ranging from a Hulk-like supersoldier to a floating snake beastie), slimy body parts, and some gun-heavy action scenes. The writing is rather wobbly in the first half (""Women and geeks first... oh, no, that's all of us""), but the sci-fi edge gives it a quirky appeal (""I guess Ike didn't want to breathe the same air as the Nazi High Command."" ""Some of them didn't even breathe air"").And ""Sanctuary"" has a pretty striking look -- half industrial science complex, and half Gothic decay, with vast cathedral-like buildings, grey cloudy skies, and the half-ruined Old City. Most of the backgrounds are CGI, which gives the series a smooth, stylized look.Despite her awkward accent, Tapping is a powerful presence as the hyperintellectual, immortal Helen Magnus, and Dunne is brilliant from the start as the Daniel Jackson of the series (smart and geeky, with a tragic past). Ryan Robbins is great as the resident techno-superbrain, who is haunted by his own Abnormal secret, and Christopher Heyerdahl does a brilliant two-character turn -- he's the charming, smooth killer John Druitt, and he's also the shy but kindly butler Bigfoot.The one false note is Ashley -- while Ullerup does a fair job, the character is an urban fantasy cliche -- cocky, gun-happy, and wears a leather catsuit during fights. But the supporting cast is pretty fascinating, especially since the writers start ushering in Victorian literary and historical figures.""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"" has some mighty wobbles in its first half, but the second half stabilizes and flowers like a black rose. Watch it, if nothing else to prepare for the second season.",N/A

He has really captured the spirit of the story, creating a beautiful touching film, which also provides a visual feast.

The previews just never convinced me it would be great.  And I was right.Now don't get me wrong.  There were some genuine laughs in the film.  The mice we meet in the pet store stole the show, for example.  I couldn't stop laughing at them.  The effects were very well done, too.  But the majority of the movie wasn't that great.The plot was full of cliches from start to finish.  That's not necessarily a deal killer for me, but the rest of the movie has to be good enough to make up for it, and it wasn't.One of the big problems was that the movie just didn't feel like it was going anywhere.  There were lots of jokes and pop cultural references, and I felt like they were designed to hide the fact that the plot was weak from us.  Even the characters were flat and dull.  And I really feel sorry for the humans in the movie who were little more than cardboard characters.

1208733,"Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir (2008), a unique combination of Animation/Documentary/Biography/ Drama/ War is not easy to watch and almost impossible to forget. It is original and unusual but in its core it reminded me of a film from many years ago that explored persistence of memory which can't be stopped or avoided - ""Muriel"" (1963) directed by Alain Resnais. One of ""Muriel"" characters is a former soldier who was hunted by the memories of the war in Algiers and the local girl tortured and killed by the French soldiers. As in Muriel, the main theme of the Israeli film is reality vs. memory of it. Can we always trust ourselves with what we remember? Does our memory reflect the events the way they really happened or our vision of them is altered as time passes and new realities inevitably enter our lives? Ari Folman and his team use an innovative technique to tell the harrowing story.  It is the first time, a film-maker blends documentary and animation, history and fiction to create such powerful, tragic yet beautiful film which I simply can't stop thinking about.  By making himself a character of the film who tried to understand why he has no recollections of the events he had been a participant in some and an eyewitness to the others, and gradually unveiling the long hidden unbearable truth, it seems Folman made the film as a metaphor for the whole country trying to block from memory a very dark, difficult, controversial and shameful page in its history that is known as The Sabra and Shatila massacre. It was carried out between September 16 and 18, 1982 by the Lebanese Forces Christian militia group, following the assassination of Phalangist leader and president-elect Bashir Gemayel. It is not the purpose of this short review to comment on the Sabra and Shatila massacre. I just want to point out that the information available from the different Internet sources is not always complete. A very important fact has been omitted from Wikipedia that ""Israeli troops allowed the Phalangists to enter two refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila to root out terrorist cells believed located there. It had been estimated that there may have been up to 200 armed men in the camps working out of the countless bunkers built by the PLO over the years, and stocked with generous reserves of ammunition. When Israeli soldiers ordered the Phalangists out, they found hundreds dead (estimates range from 460 according to the Lebanese police, to 700-800 calculated by Israeli intelligence). The dead, according to the Lebanese account, included 35 women and children. The rest were men: Palestinians, Lebanese, Pakistanis, Iranians, Syrians and Algerians.""  ([...])This is a very sad and powerful movie that left a lasting impression on me but I understand that not all viewers feel the same way. My husband kept saying, ""So what? What new did they say? The War, any war is dirty, unglamorous and destroying for every side involved. Thousands of innocent die tragically. The war brings shame and guilt, remorse and nightmares to the soldiers who follow orders."" I agree with him but I understand why the director Ari Folman who is a Veteran of the First Lebanon War has made the film and what he tried to achieve. For almost 27 years, the debates have never stopped regarding the responsibility of Israeli military for the massacre because the Sabra and Shatila camps had been under the control of The Israeli Defense Force (IDF). By the words of Folman, his goal was not naming the guilty parties but trying to understand what is going on with these who fought as the Israeli soldiers during the First Lebanon War in Beirut and saw the results of horrors with their own eyes. Explaining why he chose to make the film as a documentary in the animated format, Ari said that animation had given him the necessary freedom in his creative process and the chance to blend the facts of reality with the perceptions, feelings and deeply hidden images in the memories of the retired soldiers- his friends and comrades whose recollections of these few days in September of 1982 as well as his own made the film possible.The technique which is actually a combination of Adobe Flash cutouts and classic animation has produced simple, gripping and fascinating images. The atmosphere is surreal to which the dark disturbing color scheme appropriately contributes. The visual originality and innovation are accompanied by sorrowful haunting  soundtrack and the songs written for the film that add to the deep emotional impact the movie made on me.",N/A

1256252,"The recent Rise and Fall of WCW DVD has sparked more controversy than any recent WWE documentary, but is it for good reason?  Well...no.If anything, this DVD is a victim of drabness.  When I bought this, I was hoping that there would be more talk of the on-camera stories of WCW.  I don't necessarily mean it should be kayfabe, but there are a lot of really good (or at the very least, interesting) storylines from the 1986-1996 period which are almost forgotten today.  Combine that with stories about WCW stars like Rick Rude, Vader, Cactus Jack, and Sid Vicious, who are not always as documented as some of their contemporaries, and there is potential for real excitement.However, this DVD is 95% behind-the-scenes, as in ""This guy ran WCW, then this guy, than this guy, then this guy, then Vince bought it.  The End.""  This isn't that bad, as we get a lot of great clips along the way and a few moments of insight (I always love to hear from Michael Hayes), but the whole thing feels incomplete.Additionally, most of the behind-the-scenes stuff lacks juice, as the DVD tries too hard to not put anybody down.  Everybody who ran WCW, from Bill Watts to Jim Herd, are portrayed as meaning well but, gosh, just not working out.  Even Vince Russo is cited as `a real creative guy.""  I realize no human being is perfect, but all of WCW's heads made at least a few huge mistakes,  which are largely glossed over.  For example, the racial controversy surrounding Bill Watts's tenure is included as a deleted scene.  The fact that this story didn't even make the final cut shows the priorities of the DVD.I can't really fault the makers, as WCW hardcore fans (of which I am not one), probably don't want a DVD that highlights all the times they screwed up, but there is room for debate and discussion, which the documentary does not allow.As for the extra matches, WWE DVDs these days are more about releasing rarer matches than necessarily the best ones, and I'd be a fool to argue with that.  If you want only 5-star matches, there's probably 5 different DVDs you can find them on.  Generally, I liked about half of them and didn't care much for the other half, my favorites being Rick Rude vs. Sting (I'm a mark for Rick Rude) and Goldberg vs. DDP (Goldberg's best match, IMO).WCW fans looking for a definitive DVD are likely to be disappointed, those with low expectations should find at least a few things they like.",The Rise & Fall of WCW
223130,"This one will only really satisfy the real fans, if even them. The story used here comes from a script that they had worked out for ""Star Trek Phase II"", the sequel series that Paramount considered producing in the seventies. As an episode in a long running series, it would have worked. In fact, it largely resembles the basic story for the original series episode ""The Changeling"" from the sixties.The bad thing, though, is that, in order to take a story from an episode and make it a 2hr+ movie, they added several long scenes of people waiting and looking at ... something. It's never clearly explained, though it's easier to understand the geometry of V'ger's ship in this Director's Cut, with better special effects. It doesn't help the slow plotting, but it eliminates a bit of the confusion.In the end, there are some classic Trek moments here and there, but you have to wade through this plodding movie to get to them. Basically, the best thing to come out of this movie is that it proved that people still had a desire for more Trek. It did monster business when it came out, but people soon realized it wasn't all they'd hoped. The studios wised up before making the next one, but they could see that there was a market.More specific to this DVD release, the special features are quite interesting if you like understanding how movies are made.Just remember, this movie is really best viewed by those who already love the series and can forgive a misstep here and there.",N/A

1119045,"Mulberry Street (Jim Mickle, 2006)28 Days Later... ripoff that could have been so much better than it is, but actually isn't half bad. Co-written by Mickle and star Nick Damici (In the Cut), featuring cameos from Larry Fessenden and Debbie Rochon, and about a plague of mutant rats chowing down on New York City--what's not to like?Plot: the rats in New York turn deadly after mutating; their bites turn New Yorkers into bloodthirsty homicidal maniacs. The action revolves around a tenement building on Mulberry Street whose surviving tenants--including an ex-boxer (Damici), a drag queen (Basquiat's Ron Brice), a barmaid (Sad Spanish Song's Bo Corre) and her son (Maid in Manhattan's Javier Picayo), and a World War II vet (Larry Medich) and his son (Fast Horses' Larry Fleischman). Oh, and there's the boxer's daughter (Our Lady of Victory's Kim Blair), home from the Iraq War, trying to get back to the building, but having a hard time after the city shuts down the subway system because of the rat attacks.What's not to like? Well, I don't want to spoil the surprise for you, but let me just say that this would have been just as good a movie--no, a much better movie--without the credited ""creature effects"". All you have to do is turn people into bloodthirsty killers and you've got yourself a story. You don't need to turn them into monsters as well, unless you've got a portion of your budget specifically earmarked for special effects. I knew the flick was going to go downhill early on, when the building super (Tim House), who's been bitten by a rat, starts growing hair on his ears very quickly. Oh, no, I thought, you're not going to take this really fine little horror flick, which is actually working as a suspense film during the inevitably slow beginning, and try to turn it into a generic monster movie, are you? Oh, but they did. I almost wept.The other major problem the movie has is that there are so many places where the script starts to branch out into complex, interesting character development, so many stubs that tell us that given a little more time and another rewrite or so this movie would have given us a plethora of characters we could have come to care about. None of those stubs, however, ended up growing legs. There's an aborted romantic subplot, a lot of backstory with the boxer's daughter and what happened to her overseas (though I was impressed they scrapped the almost-inevitable teary comparison between the horrors of war and the horrors of rat-bitten homicidal maniacs), some bonding between the barmaid's son and the boxer that never goes anywhere, a bit of weirdness with the (stereotypical, but hey) creepy super, all of which could have been expanded, but never went anywhere. Depressing. But I chose to look at this as a movie made by a couple of guys who really have the potential to get good at this moviemaking thing, and with Larry Fessenden coming onboard (his production company is bankrolling Mickle's next film, also co-written by Damici), I have high hopes that some of that potential will be realized next time out.

For the last ten years or so Smith seems to be resting on his laurels.  He seems to think a barrage of scatalogical dialogue and outrageous visual gags is creative.  It just gets numbing and tiresome after awhile.  Yes, there is a theme here in that can you fully divorce feeling from the sexual act if you truly love the one your with.  Noble sentiment but it's undermined by the barrage of crude humor.  Smith should look to his predecessors like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, and the Farrelly brothers to see how to pull this off.  Better yet is taking cues from Jud Apatow who probably could mined this material for all it's worth.  It seems like Smith is trying to push the envelope of what you can get away with in an ""R"" rated movie instead making something profound and lasting.

Beck's playing is beyond amazing, and to hear someone his age still pushing the envelope of what's possible with an electric guitar is to wonder what all the other geezers are doing (I'm that age, too, so I can say that). The recording here is much better than the companion CD, which is drenched in reverb that puts the music at a distance. Here the sound is immediate and really captures the superlative touch and dynamics that Beck brings to it. The only weak spot here is the editing, which is annoying as hell, never leaving the camera on anything for more than a couple of seconds and jumping all over like a snake on caffeine. I find that this is true of most of the music videos I see these days, and it makes me crazy. If I were at that concert, my eyes wouldn't be jumping around that like (I'd be sick if they did). I'd be focused on the whole band and whoever was soloing at the time. Why can't editors just do the same thing and let the music do the work.

The picture on my copy is FILLED with digital noise and snow. It's not just a mild amount that might have proved mildly distracting, but a thick layer of white grain that looks as if I'm peering through a blizzard.I logged on to amazon earlier today to see if anyone else was having this same issue and sure enough, others are reporting the same problem on varying levels. The issue is definitely not with my player. I have a magnificent Oppo BDP-83 which always delivers the finest High Definition picture possible on my new Samsung LCD. Should I return my defective disc in hopes of receiving a corrected copy or just inquire about receiving a full refund? I'm really not sure, but I am certainly sad that I am being deprived of enjoying one of my favorite films due to a production error from the otherwise phenomenal Criterion collection.",N/A
441656,"The DVD transfer is really pretty good.  There are a few scratches here and there but they don't cause any problems.  For the great part of the film, it is clear and sharp.The title is actually ""The Trollenberg Terror"" but packaged under it's American release name.  This film holds suspense well, has some nice underplayed acting jobs and builds it's pace well enough to keep the viewer involved.  A United Nations science expert (B movie guy, Cameron Mitchell) is called to Switzerland to investigate a number of gruesome beheadings high in the Swiss Alps. Along the way Mitchell meets the usual pretty girl in these pictures but here, the girl travels with another girl, a clairvoyant(Janet Munro).  The creatures at the tops of Alps sense the clairvoyant and she can sense them.  This brings the film to its conflict as the ""Crawling Eyes"" have to take her out to remain undetected.  As the monsters come closer and closer to the town more murders, more strange happenings until.....we meet the EYE.  Ok.....you have to watch film to find out the rest.Recommended for:  '50s Sci Fi fans, horror fans.  Not suitable for smaller children.  The gore has minimum shock value based on the black and white film medium but there is still gore.",N/A

732085,"This 2000 Neapolitan production isn't in any way superior to the 1988 Milanese under Gavazzeni (where are the gondoliers, and why does Jacopo - in the subtitles - refer to his 'sons' when his second son is a girl?). That Nucci (Francesco) and La Scola (Jacopo) are let down by the strangulated voice of Pendatchanska (Lucrezia) isn't as irritating as the disastrous cuts made to the score. Did Santi think that today's audiences are as tolerant about cuts as they were in the past, or that they wouldn't notice what has been edited out simply because it's a rare work? Not only second verses but also snippets (in fact, gems) here and there are disposed of as if it were an overlong Wagner opera (its total duration when given complete is just under two hours). FOSCARI being my favourite early Verdi opera, I couldn't enjoy this performance: I felt cheated and robbed of many lovely phrases (what a sacrilege to cut two thirds of the finale of the love duet). Despite Roark-Strummer's uneven Lucrezia, I'll stick to the Gavazzeni DVD (recently re-released on the budget label Brilliant): mercifully (though it's still annoying and even weird), only the second verse of Jacopo's Act 1 cabaletta and three short phrases from the end of the Act 2 love duet are cut. Two stars for Nucci and La Scola, and three Boos! to whoever sanctioned those cuts, be it producer, director, or conductor (I suspect the last).","Verdi - I due Foscari / Nello Santi - Nucci, La Scola, Pendatchanska - Teatro di San Carlo Napoli"

112523,"Wow! The Blu-ray is the transfer we've been waiting for. It eclipses all previous ones (at least, those I've seen), including the well-done LV.""NbNW"" has never been a particularly ""good-looking"" film. Projection prints were grainy and contrasty, with vivid, vulgar colors. This transfer -- made from the camera negatives, or something close -- corrects these problems.For the first time, we can see just how /beautiful/ ""NbNW"" is, and the outstanding quality of the cinematography. The scene in which Mason closes the drapes and turns on the lights, while he and Grant eye each other and waltz around the room, has a sense of depth and ""tonality"" I've ever seen before. Even better is the scene on the train where Grant and Saint engage in ""intercourse"" while clothed and standing up (Hitchcock knew how to get around the censors! *). It's soft and romantic, a quality quite lost in previous transfers.Interestingly, the matte paintings, rear projection, and static mattes are /less/ obvious than they were in previous versions. The scene in which Thornhill and the Professor walk toward the plane is perhaps the finest example of rear projection you'll ever see. You have to look closely to realize they're /not/ at an airport. **""NbNW"" was shot in VistaVision (""Motion-Picture High Fidelty""). It uses what still photographers would call a full 35mm frame (rather than the half frame used for movies), and therefore runs horizontally through the camera. Of all 35mm formats, VistaVision was /made/ for high-definition video. Its basic aspect ratio is 5:3 (within the 3:2 film frame), and it can be matted to wider aspect ratios in the camera or during projection. ***""NbNW"" was probably intended to be projected at 1.85:1. This transfer is at the slightly less-wide 16:9 (1.77:1), an excellent choice that fills the HD screen. Nothing is lost, and there are no distracting borders (for those bothered by such things).And let's not forget the sound, because this is a Bernard Herrmann score. As far as I know, this is the first transfer to present all the music in stereo (ditto for sound effects). (The LV had only the overture in stereo.) The sound is fantastically good -- if you're so young you think ""digital good, analog not-so-good"", you need to hear this. ****I have some gripes. Several shots in the crop-duster sequence have a ""splotch"" near the center, likely due to a water droplet that dried on the lens. And the brightness of some of the static mattes in the Mount Rushmore sequence flickers quite obviously. These would not have required a lot of work to correct.Another reviewer has criticized the color, and I'm inclined to agree. Male skin tones are excessively warm, even yellowish. This is fine for Cary Grant -- who sported a perpetual Douglas Fairbanks tan -- but most of the male actors look as if they've spent too much time under a sun lamp. Now, get this... excerpts from this transfer used in the supplemental material have more-natural skin tones! Why this is, I don't know, but I've seen it on several recent Blu-rays -- the image quality in the supplements is better than that of the film itself.As is becoming increasingly common for ""important"" movies, the disk is encased in a souvenir book. It's nice, but substance-free. You'll read it once, then put it aside. (It's a shame such books don't attempt to duplicate the contents of road-show souvenir booklets, but the format doesn't lend itself to it.)As for the film itself, what is there to say? A classic, a perfect example of how Hitch was able to ""play"" the audience like an organ. In my ""Snow White"" review, I suggest that it is possibly the most consciously ingenuous film ever made. Hitchcock's films are the polar opposite -- consciously disingenuous. He's not just telling a story, but deliberately manipulating the audience. The audience knows it, but loves it anyhow.Perhaps the most-amazing thing about ""NbNW"" is the way Hitchcock seamlessly melds humor, suspense, and action. (Grant's ability to switch instantly between restrained-ironic and dead-serious helps.) Only Steven Spielberg has come close. But he'll never be a Hitchcock.* Thematically, ""NbNW"" is much like ""Notorious"" -- Ingrid Bergman is a ""loose"" woman coerced into marrying Claude Rains so she can spy on him for the government. In a famous scene, Hitchcock got around the Code's restriction on how long a man and woman can kiss by repeatedly having Grant and Bergman break the kiss, then start over -- which makes the scene even more sensual.** MGM probably realized that VistaVision would reveal problems not visible in a smaller format, and spent the money for better effects shots.*** Given the high cost of VistaVision prints and the need for a special projector, few theaters were able to project VistaVision as it was meant to be seen. Most VistaVision prints are half-frame reductions, which lose most of the original quality.**** I used to do live recording, and digital comes closer to live sound. But... in the late 50s and early 60s, analog tape recording had reached a level of transparency, ""immediacy"", realism, and just plain ""euphony"" you rarely hear today. Simply in terms of ""sounding good"", this 50-year-old soundtrack is state-of-the-art. (If you want to hear a modern recording that's better -- that is, coming significantly closer to live sound -- try the Rilling performance of Britten's ""War Requien"".)",North by Northwest VHS
1066942,"This workout (also known as ""The Shape of Things to Come"") was the first DVD I tried from instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer, who quickly went on to become one of my favorite fitness instructors. I found it very inspiring that Kelly, who has been involved in fitness for quite a long time, is a mom in her 40s (and who also lives in my hometown!), yet she has plenty of energy for this tough workout! This DVD contains a 50-minute circuit-style workout which alternates toning work with short cardio intervals. Some of the cardio work uses an optional step, but you could easily modify if you don't have a step (or substitute a small, sturdy stool, as you don't need much width). Kelly also uses two sets of dumbbells, which she labels ""light"" and ""heavy""; you might need to experiment a bit to figure out what works best for you here. The time breakdown listed on the DVD case is as follows: Warm-up, 4 minutes, Sculpting and Cardio, 34 minutes, Chest and Abs, 10 minutes, Stretch, 2 minutes.The warm-up uses mostly basic, familiar moves, but somehow, Kelly makes these seem more fun! She includes knee-ups on the step and ends with some front and side kicks, which I loved. The first sculpting interval comes next and is focused on back/core. Using your ""heavy"" weights, you'll start with a very functional fitness-oriented ""chop"" move, first going halfway, then all the way down to the floor. Next comes a v-press, a front pull/press combo, and an underhand/overhand row, with the entire circuit repeated once. The first cardio interval begins with plyo lunges on the step (there is quite a bit of impact throughout the video, but again, it's easily modified), squat, slide, and step-knees. For the second sculpting segment, you'll focus on shoulders, this time using your ""light"" weights. Kelly begins with a unique side/front staggered raise, moves into a forward raise with upright row, and finishes with side delt raises and a shoulder press; again, the series is repeated. You'll then go back, repeat the previous cardio segment, and then repeat the entire shoulder work sequence once more.The next cardio segment starts with jumping jacks--I usually hate these, but as before, Kelly makes them fun! You do two jacks, a slow jack, and then a plyo X--a jump to each side while in a boxer's crouch--before finishing with hamstring curls on the step. The next sculpting interval consists of biceps work: hammer curls, side curls with a slow count down, half-up curls, and front elbow lifts; you then repeat both the jumping jack cardio series and the biceps work. The final cardio choreography has the most impact, and I found it to be the most intense as well. You'll do a wide jog, a skate from side to side, jump rope, and then plyo hops on the step. The last sculpting series works the triceps in several unique ways. First comes French presses and tricep kickbacks, but then you do a move which I've never seen before, sort of like an upright row behind your back, and you finish by lifting your arms straight behind you. The high impact-cardio and triceps work are both repeated.Are you wondering when the leg work is going to come in? Well, the last standing segment is sort of a cardio sculpting series focused on the lower body. Using your heavy weights and moving very quickly, you'll squat and place both weights on the floor, squat and pick up one weight, squat and pick up the other weight, and then repeat the entire sequence MANY times (you may want to consider starting with lighter weights here). Next, you'll do what Kelly calls ""a skater's lunge"" but which I've usually seen called a curtsy dip: you'll lunge one leg behind the other on an angle, with the added twist of holding a dumbbell in your opposite hand and touching it to the floor in front of your static foot. You'll do all the reps on one side before moving to the other, then repeat the squat series (I was feeling pretty tired the second time through!), and finally, finish with the skater's lunge, alternating sides this time.You're not done yet, though--now it's on the the floor for chest/abs work! Kelly lies on the step, but you can lie directly on the floor if needed. The chest series includes chest press, wide-angle chest press, 2-count chest flyes, and lower chest/tricep pushes. The abs work was the only part of this video that I found a bit on the boring side, as it's just a simple series of crunches: crunch up, crunch lifting leg in and out, crunch lifting leg in/out and twisting to the side, and repeat on other side. Both the chest and the abs sequences are repeated once. Kelly finishes with a very quick stretch. Still lying on the step, she stretches the hamstrings, moves to seated for a chest/back stretch, stretches the neck on both sides, and yes, now you're done!I really enjoy this workout--the time flies by, particularly during the cardio intervals, and the toning work is fun, unique, varied, plus has a functional fitness flavor (ie, mimicking movements from everyday life such as twisting). I would rate this as a mid-to-high intermediate workout, but it would probably be doable for advanced beginners by using even lighter weights and going without the step (those wanting more of a challenge can heavy up on the weights if they dare and use a higher step). The DVD is very well-chaptered with various shorter workout premix options, such as just doing the cardio, completing only a single circuit, etc. Overall, this DVD a wonderful addition to my video library and highly recommended!",Complete Cardio Sculpting with Kelly Coffey-Meyer

Hard to believe it's 45 years old, kudos to Warner for really cleaning up this old gem!Admittedly, most Elvis movies were forgetable but not this one, it's a lot of fun. I enjoyed the scenery of old Las Vegas and the songs were quite good. Elvis himself seems to be having a good time and so do the other actors. No doubt he enjoyed this movie more than others of the same era, you can see it in his performance.But what really makes the film special is Ann-Margret! She is incredibly beautiful and alive. Whether dancing, singing or just being - every scene she's in glows plus she breathes life into Elvis' performance too - there is real chemistry between these stars.If you're looking for an Elvis movie to watch, this is one of his best.

190424,"I've never been much for Keanu Reeves.  I'd always thought the guy was a throwaway schmuck who somehow got lucky and impressed the right people to get to where he is today.  Not to mention a lousy actor!  Can anyone honestly buy Reeves as an Englishman(in Bram Stoker's Dracula) or a southern lawyer(in The Devil's Advocate)?  Then someone got the hot idea of trying to make Reeves into some kind of action star like in Point Break, Speed and The Matrix!  I don't know who thought this was a good idea, but Reeves is as convincing playing a tough guy or cop as he would be playing Cab Calloway.But it's not so much Reeves' fault, he just isn't put in the right roles.  That's where the Night Before comes in.  This is the ultimate Keanu reeves film.  I used to watch it over and over back when it was constantly played on HBO.  I even had the one sheet poster hanging in my bedroom at one time!It's the best acting Reeves has ever done.  Why?  Because he's totally believable in this role.  This dorky kind of character is what Reeves is born to play.  He's so good in this, he carries the whole film.  Bill & Ted is a close second, and I'll give the guy credit, he was good in River's Edge.  But this is Reeves' masterpiece.It's kinda like a lighter version of Scorsese's After Hours.  Reeves is high school nerd, Winston Connelly.  He wakes up in an alley in a slum part of L.A. and can't remember how he got there.  As he wanders around the streets and has run ins with various characters, bit by bit he remembers what had happened earlier that night.  He had taken the most popular girl in school, Tara, to the prom(she had lost a bet with her friend and as the loser, she had to go to the prom with the school geek.  It's funny coz she pretty much tells Winston this flat out, but he either doesn't care or is too dumb to understand the situation), but through a series of goofy events, he ended up selling her to a pimp and winding up on that pimp's hit list.  Now Winston must find Tara in the wee hours of the morning before he ends up dead, either at the hands of the angry pimp, or Tara's detective father.  During his quest he meets a bunch of odd characters, including a helpful prostitute played by Teresa Saldana.  A subplot appears to have been cut from the film.  I think the idea is that Winston had had sex with Saldana's character the night before, as she hints at this when we first see her.  Plus, I remember the plot description on the back of the VHS box saying that Winston had lost his date, his car, and his virginity all in one night!  Oh, well, it woulda been cool.  I know I'd do Teresa Saldana(and Lori Loughlin for that matter).  In the club scenes we're treated to George Clinton, Bootsy Collins and the P-Funk All stars.  In fact, it's because of this movie that I even know of George Clinton.  If I hadn't had seen The Night Before, I'd probably never had bought a Parliament or Funkadelic album.  They have some awesome songs for the film.  If anyone knows if these songs are available on cd, please let me know.By the end of the night, Winston has gone through a period of self discovery and has become a tougher and more confident guy.  Not to mention Tara now has the hots for him!This is quite the entertaining movie.  I gave it five stars, mostly due to childhood nostalgia, but this film is actually pretty good.  I'm surprised it never became more popular.  Again, Reeves is terrific in this part.  This is a part he was born to play, and as absurd as many of the situations are, he's believable as this character.  Even when he becomes more of a tough guy throughout the night, it really works coz he's so clumsy when trying to be a hero.  Lori Loughlin is a snotty little turd, but man, is she a cutie.The film was directed by Thom Eberhardt, who also made the quirky and fun, Night of the Comet.It's great that Lionsgate has released a batch of ""lost"" films of the 80s, I hope to see more released over time.  The DVD is pretty much bare bones except for an optional Trivia Track which is very disappointing because it barely pertains to the movie at all!  I was hoping for some cool The Night Before fun facts, but it was all lame-o information.  But it is still great to finally have this one out on DVD.

615168,"Recently Danny Boyle won the best directing Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, a worthy award winner in my opinion. Boyle is a director that never rests on his laurels, recreating genres every time he steps up to the plate. One of his most familiar is the polarizing dramedy Trainspotting, but he's also recreated the sci-fi movie with Sunshine, the kids movie with Millions and so on. Danny Boyle is a filmmaker worthy to be listed among the great auteurs like Scorsese, Hitchcock, and so on. With 28 Days Later... (unfortunately, often referred to as a ""zombie"" movie, though it's not) he tackles horror with excellent precision.28 Days Later opens with scenes of violence being watched by a monkey on a TV screen as he lays strapped down in a lab. Extremist animal activists break into the lab in an effort to save the animals from being tested on only to find they've been infected with a highly contagious virus known as Rage. Disaster leads to death and devastation throughout all of London. Cut to Jim (Cillian Murphy) 28 days later, a bike courier waking up from a coma in an empty hospital. After wandering across London, bewildered by the lack of people, he's saved by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) as he's being chased by the infected denizens of the city. After finding other survivors, Frank and Hannah (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns), they hear a radio broadcast from a military installment which houses other horrors for our survivors.While often considered a zombie movie, and it borrows liberally from many past zombie movies, 28 Days Later is not a zombie movie. The infected in this movie are living beings, infected by a virus that similar to Ebola is communicable by blood, and has more affect on the brain than the physicality of a human being. This is important to the message of the movie as the virus represents something that is inherent in all of us and leads to social unrest and the breakdown of modern society, as the virus did in the movie. In this Boyle has done something that he does very well in every one of his movies: creates a great social commentary. Throughout the course of the movie we see that there are those who would fight against a society gone wrong, and those that would exploit it. Yet, while exploring the themes of moral ambiguity, Boyle never handles them with a heavy handed approach.Having a moral/ social message is important to good horror in this reviewers opinion, but how the movie looks and feels is easily just as important to hold the viewers attention. Boyle chose to shoot the majority of the movie with DV cameras, giving the movie a gritty post apocalyptic type feel while also giving the movie a kind of documentary feel as well. On top of that, the DV camera also allowed for tricks that gives the infected an otherworldly look, making them seem scarier when they're bum rushing their ""prey"". The visuals selected to fill the frame also give you a glimpse at an alien world, a city, or a grocery store that should be buzzing with people, but because of the look of film, it seems even more eerie when you see it emptied of all presence.The acting of course is top notch, as anyone whose seen Brendan Gleeson act would expect, but the movie really belongs to Cillian Murphy who had his break out performance in this movie. As Jim, a man who went down one day in a bustling city, and woke up the next in an empty city, Murphy shows the pain of a man whose lost everything before he even knew what had happened to him. Cillian gives us a man in the middle of a crisis that we truly believe his arc from a pained and scared man just waking up at the end of the world to a man who will fight through all hell to protect those he cares about. Naomie Harris, who also received great acclaim for this movie, portrays a strong woman struggling with her fear and sorrow, but always holding it in, trying to steel herself from pain to come. Also keep your eyes open for Christopher Eccleston, who will become the future Dr. Who a few years after this movie.For as great as the movie is though, I do have my nitpicks. Calling the virus Rage seems a little too on the nose for my tastes, but luckily this isn't mentioned too often throughout. At the beginning there are also glaring plotholes in the scheme of today's society. Why is Jim the only patient to not be evacuated from the hospital? And why did they leave a comatose patient naked in the ICU? Why are there no cars left on the streets of London, or along the highways? A lot of this is due to the budget of the film, and can be explained away, but as there are no answers to be found within the actual narrative of the movie they must be left as plotholes. Luckily, as the only plotholes are mainly to be found at the beginning of the movie they do not detract from the movie as a whole, and will be forgotten by most by the end of the movie.For fans of horror, and movies with a deeper socio-political meaning this is definitely a must watch, but think before you decide to show this to your kids. There is full male nudity, as well as a lot of cursing. But if you're looking for a captivating horror this movie is definitely for you.4/5",28 Days Later
1198645,"(I left this same review for the starter set disk 1, but wanted to comment on the entire show as well.)Every now and then I come across an anime that is unlike anything else out there. Mushi-shi is one of these. Not only is the story highly original, the entire production from the music and animation to the packaging and even the English dubbing is outstanding.This is one of those series that is hard to describe to someone else. I've tried, and I usually get a weird look: ""A wandering medicine man cures people of ails that are caused by supernatural ""bug-like"" organisms called ""mushi""... that means ""bug"" in Japanese....um...well, it's really cool, I promise."" The story really is that simple, but this is one adventure that you just have to experience for yourself. No major story, no complex plot. Just Ginko, the mushi-master, traveling the gorgeous backcountry of Japan and encountering bizarre and fascinating cases of mushi infestation. Some he is able to solve, others nearly cost him his life. The individual episodes range from lighthearted to downright creepy, but always I am left feeling a sense of satisfaction and wonder when the episode is through.A word about the music in this series. If you use iTunes, look up ""The Sore Feet Song"". This is the opening theme to Mushi-Shi, and I swear every review of this song on iTunes mentions Mushi-shi. I downloaded Ally Kerr's whole album because of this show. Each ending theme for Mushi-shi is specially composed for each episode and fits with the show perfectly.The more anime I watch, the more I realize that shows like Mushi-shi are rare jewels. There is nothing else in the anime world, besides perhaps Miyazaki, that approaches the level of surrealism, creativity and beauty portrayed in this series.Mushi-shi won't please everybody. If you demand a complex plot or a lot of action, you won't find it here. But if you are the sort who likes the unconventional and appreciates true quality, don't pass on this show.",Mushi-shi: The Complete Series
1090919,"The opening scene of this film immediately drew me in.  I found the scene in which Robert Carlyle decides to abandon his wife to save his own life utterly gut wrenching to watch.  I watch a lot of horror movies and am not easily shocked but for some reason a few scenes in the film really hit me.  I kept thinking of ""what if"" scenarios and how would I react in this situation.  Would I be humane or do what it takes to save myself just to survive.  The only reason this film didn't receive 5 stars from me is not because it wasn't a worth sucessor to the original but because of all of the little unbelievable details that seemed to happen throughout the movie.Pros+ Brutal opening and a few other tough scenes to watch, usually when the ""rage"" infected are attacking their victims.+ Very few slow moments and since the infected move just as fast as every one else there's not the typical run, hide and wait for the zombies to get me.+ The atmosphere of the film was very tense and I found myself tensing up several times without realizing it.+ Gore and special effects were noteworthy.Cons- Story was rather transparent and not very believable.  Would they really let a population of 15,000 people settle in a recently infected but purged London?  They mentioned several times all other areas of the city were not safe.- Jerky and grainy camera work.  Whether it was intentional or not it definitely is not for someone who would suffer from motion sickness.- The ease of which the children escaped the military compound and get into the infected part of the city was laughable.- The father (a janitor) who had an all access pass to the entire facility presses a lockdown button to prove a point to his kids without any reprecussions?-  The infected but immune mother (who unbelievably survived) was left unguarded!  She possibly held the cure for the ""rage"" infection in her blood but she's left alone for the husband to find her and become reinfected, destroying the whole compound.- The lone helicopter pilot was allowed to fly unchecked the entire film, even when military jets are firebombing the compound to destroy the infected.- An infected father who even though he was infected by the ""rage"" was able to avoid being killed, firebombed and track his children to a subway station outside of the compound.Despite all of the cons listed above I still really enjoyed the movie for the sheer tension the movie seemed to instill.  While I didn't feel it had the same originality of the original 28 Days Later it's definitely worth a watch for horror fans.",28 Weeks Later

1204585,"If you want the definite classic Schoolhouse Rock collection of cartoons that aired in the 70's the 30th Anniversary Edition is the one to get. Last year they released what they called the Election Collection to capitalize on the 2008 Presidential election, and it was mostly a stunted selection of classics with a single brand new cartoon. Suffice it to say that was a bit of a disappointment considering what you are getting. This time around you get all new cartoons and songs with Schoolhouse Rock: Earth.There are no recycled videos here. Everything in this DVD is newly created content that is themed around the planet Earth, its ecology and conservation. You get 12 brand new songs (plus one bonus song) in this collection. Here is the track list:1. Report from the North Pole2. The Little Things We Do3. The Trash Can Band4. You Oughta Be Savin' Water5. The Rainforest6. Save the Ocean7. FatCat Blue: The Clean Rivers Song8. A Tiny Urban Zoo9. Solar Power to the People10. Windy the Windmills11. Don't Be A Carbon Sasquatch12. The Three R's (Music Video by Mitchel Musso)Bonus Song: Energy BluesEven though the music is newly created is still holds on to that classic SHR sound. I won't go as far as say it's as good as the classics, but they do a fine enough job keeping away from ""modernizing"" the look and sound. Many of the new songs aren't as eco-preachy as you may think, and tend to give more practical ideas (for kids) on how to help ""save the planet"". This DVD is themed and the videos do link together in a way that tells a story with some polar bears used to link the videos. It kind of gets in the way of the classic feel if you ask me, but at least it's not invasive enough to get in the way of the songs.The DVD is going to be in widescreen format and the audio will Dolby 5.1 surround. Being that these are new songs the surround is a better experience than the Election Collection. Obviously this collection is for you eco-conservationists and as a tool to help teach your youngins' it will do nicely. If you love Schoolhouse Rock, but hate Earth Day then you're probably better off with just the classics. Just love Schoolhouse Rock? Well this is a tight-themed DVD, but it is new content. I suppose let your pocketbook decide on that.",N/A

509375,"My headline offers a subjective question, but I think most people would at least agree this is one of the best war movies they've seen, especially if they have a pretty decent 5.1 surround sound system. You can't fully appreciate this DVD and movie, in generally, without the great surround this disc offers.Sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The visuals are outstanding, too, and we'll see a Blu-Ray version of this film soon, making it even better.Since the film has been out for over 10 years, there is no sense going into the story. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is today.It makes you appreciate what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, bad language and/or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, maybe the most dramatic in the history  of film.By the way, is this the best war movie ever made: yeah, I think so.",Saving Private Ryan VHS
42877,"I think this is an excellent movie because it is able to depict the native americans as human beings that just want to live in a group in harmony with their environment.  One of the failures of The Founding Fathers is they were unable to implement a policy that included the native americans in society.  (Another major failure was not addressing slavery, but that is another story.)  So, Manifest Destiny took over which led to the near extinction of buffalo and the unneccessary slaughter of many native americans.  It was nice to have this fantasy story where some of them survived and continued their own way of life, even if it is fiction.There is a shop in Mendocino, California that sells a T-shirt with a picture of Apaches with rifles on the front.  The caption is: ""Homeland Security Since 1492.""  I find that applicable.  Once in 1969 I made a comment to a Blackfoot person at a gas station just East of Glacier Park.  I was intending to be sympathetic, but in retrospect it was probably gratuitous.  The fellow's retort was:  ""yeah, we should have killed that ****er Columbus when he stepped off the boat.""

322944,"No need to say anything about the movies; for me, a huge LOTR fan, this is just the best cinematic trilogy ever. This is about the blu-ray transfer. There are people who did not like it, and this for two reasons: 1) It does not look better than the DVD. This is simply not true. I have played both Coppola restorations in the same player and TV, and the difference between the upgraded DVD and the Blu-Ray is huge. The quality of the image in Blu-Ray is just mind-blowing (at least in this US edition). 2) It is grainy. This one is true, and yet, I have seen more grain in very recent movies. And, after all, it is the original grain of the celluloid, not some DNR artifact, so it is actually cinematographically great to see it; it is the way the director and photographer intended it to look. If you want pristine grainless clarity, forget about this one (and yet, it is not that grainy...I was surprised to see so little of it after having read some grain-haters reviews), but if you want to watch it as good as, or proably better, than in cinemas, this is it.",N/A

The husband, Jimmy (Burton), is an angry young man who grew up poor and alone and who remains haunted by his past.  He obviously loves his wife (Ure), but at the same time he resents her for what he sees (I think wrongly) is a lack of empathy and emotion in her.  They come from two different worlds.The character Jimmy, despite his rage at the world, I found hard to dislike -- his obvious love for and devotion to an old woman who was like a mother to him shows, to me, he has a good heart.It's a very intense story with, I believe, a very good message, but the acting especially makes this movie a true classic.",N/A
1155186,"Probably one of the most depressing films of the year and one of the most difficult to watch for some, as it easily stirs up deep emotions for anyone who has ever lost dreams or love... have felt themselves trapped in cages... or merely questioning what is next in the life that has become anything and everything but what they had planned for. Thought-driven to its core, the film is brutally honest-- a character study that is almost uncomfortable to view at times. The chemistry between Leo and Kate is a powerful one. It is no surprise that their close relationship in real-life allowed them to transgress so completely into their on-screen ""marriage""... As they have mentioned in several interviews, this closeness allowed them to completely open up and reveal their characters... forcing and allowing them to show the intimacy needed at times and the harsh words of angered frustration and hurt at others... This, like ""DOUBT"" is an actor's showcase. For, everyone on screen, no matter how small the part, delivers! However, this is DiCaprio's film... he completely engulfs the film in his haunting performance of a man torn in an endless number of directions... Kate Winslet, as usual, breaks your heart... Both definite Oscar Nomination worthy performances... however, not necessarily winning! See it!!! But, don't expect to come out of the theater smiling...

747467,"This is generally a much loved Bollywood movie released in 1994. I think it has to be assessed within that time-frame.It has all the simplicity and naivete that Hollywood did in the 50s and early 60s. Its the sort of movie Doris Day would have starred in in terms of nice people and family values. It has scenes such as two whole families sitting in a circle and playing a game of pass the cushion and when the music stops the person holding it has to perform some forfeit piece of poetry or music. Now this tells you something about the times in itself.It is a long movie and there are many more songs than you tend to get these days. The songs were generally lively but I haven't felt tempted to download them. I did find the movie went on a bit at times though I know not all viewers felt that.It is a piece that informs a lot about Indian customs with quite long scenes laying out cultural practices around weddings and allied rituals. These are people who put family first and will sacrifice personal desires for family sake. The families intermarried are idyllic except for an aunt who provides selfish, greedy contrast.I came to Salman Khan movies this millennium and its interesting to see him younger. He is less self-conscious here and dances a lot better. I particularly noted the freer movement around his shoulders and wonder if all the bodybuilding since has locked him up there and restricted his range of movement!All actors are good and the 2 leads (Salman and Madhuri Dixit) have good chemistry in what is, unashamedly, a building romantic tale.There is nothing new here but it has its own period charms. For those who don't like sentimental or cute, for art-house cinema lovers and those who only like more real or recent stuff, this may not be for you. However for those who like Bollywood musicals this is one of the best loved in the genre- which won a swathe of awards when it was released.",N/A
1264020,"Take an excellent cast, a smart director and an accomplished screen writer, throw them into a room and let them go at it and you'd swear you'll walk away with a masterpiece, right.  Well, a masterpiece `State of Play' is not, but what it is is a very, very good movie; a great movie even.  With noteworthy performances, a tightly woven plot and engaging camera work that keeps us glued throughout, `State of Play' did more than just hold my attention; it grabbed it and flung it across the room.I knew I was going to see this movie before I knew anything about it; I am that devoted to Russell Crowe.  Then I read that it was a remake of a BBC min-series.  I still have as of yet to see that, but I will now that I've seen this film.I don't want to spoil too much of the movie, since Tony Gilroy worked real hard to make this an engaging and exciting thrill ride with twists and turns that are not predictable (even if you think they are).  All I'll say is that it starts with a murder, and then a presumed suicide.  Reporter Cal McAffrey is working on the murders, while blog reporter Della Frye is working on the suicide.  The suicide happens to be of a woman who worked for Congressman Stephen Collins, an old college buddy of Cal's.  When Cal starts to look into the young woman's death he unveils that the murder he is working on and this `suicide' seem to be related; but it goes much deeper than that.Like I said, I really don't want to give too much away.The acting here is spot on across the board.  Crowe is always a reliable source for quality entertainment, and he doesn't disappoint here.  He also doesn't out act his co-stars (which wouldn't be hard for him to do when matched with McAdams or Affleck), so the film never seems uneven.  This isn't to say that he drops the ball, for he is always in character and acting his tail off (just watch the way he processes information, that look on his face), but he knows the type of film he's in and the type of performance needed to sell this.A pleasant surprise is the fact that some actors who are less than brilliant really up their game here and deliver wonderfully.Ben Affleck shocked me with his ability to really `act', something I've rarely, if ever, seen him do.  Rachel McAdams is one of the most beautiful women on the planet (seriously) and she has shown much potential in her career.  She doesn't blow anything out of the box here, but she is consistent and believable.  Helen Mirren is a firecracker and steals her every scene.  Robin Wright Penn is touching and moving, yet forgettable.  Jeff Daniels was a nice touch, and his final confrontation with Crowe was stellar (""SON!"").  For me though, this movie belongs to Jason Bateman, an actor I am not very familiar with who just blazes the screen in his few short scenes.  He is witty, charming (in a very creepy sort of way) and wholly believable.  I just wish they had written him into a few more scenes.Like I said, this is not a masterpiece, but it is an enthralling and captivating political thriller that makes good use of its cast and its timeframe, injecting a rapid fire pace that keeps us glued to the screen, never wavering for a second or losing our interest long enough for us to get confused or give up.",N/A
1084545,"Molly Shannon (Peggy) is superb like an ordinary office employee who is not very popular but that kind of orderly, shy and sweet person who wears no fancy clothes. Even being welcomed during her usual visits by his brother's family, her snob sister-in-law, Laura Dern (Bret) has always some unpleasant comment about whatever she talks or brings home as a gift to the children. Her life companion is her dog Pensil. Animals teach a lot of things to human beings, such as friendship and love. An unfortunate happening occurs with Pensil and since this moment on Peggy has to deal with a strange neighbour who is her opposite as he a hunter, collecting a lot of weapons, mainly knives, a very interesting role played by John C. Reilly (Al). Later she knows a nice young man, Newt, played by Peter Sarsgaard who deals and trains abandoned dogs and helps Peggy to get another dog. She accepts and starts liking Newt who helps her training the dog. Some other scenes shows how people, in my opinion, should treat animals in general. Peggy gets so envolved in the subject about animals that she even becomes a vegetarian. I confess, people, I like animals, I have a lovely Black Labrador and several cats but I eat meat. I'm an hypocrite. I should be ashamed, but I believe many people do the same. Who knows I change some day... So, returning to the movie, she makes her niece, a child to think like her. What happens at her sister-in-law's home when Peggy offers to stay with the children, so the couple can leave during the New Year's eve, this is the funniest thing I saw in this movie.I warn people who watch this movie as a comedy just because Molly Shannon is in there. It is a serious movie. And I liked it even though I cried some times. The conclusion is satisfactory, in my opinion, as Peggy got to do what would be from that moment on the most important thing in her life.

1160730,"Not quite up to Morgan Spurlock's superlative documentarySuper Size Me, WHERE IN THE WORLD IS OSAMA BIN LADEN is still topical and interesting. Where Super Size Me had a distinct focus, this newest documentary loses that. Let me explain...Initially set up as a means to make the world a safer place for Morgan, his mate, and their future child, Morgan sets out to find bin Laden so that he can help the world become a safer place. Knowing that the U.S. has spent billions of dollars and countless soldier hours looking for this elusive, tall, dialysized jihadist, Morgan figures maybe all it'll take is one determined future father.Scouring the globe as if he wereCarmen Sandiego(Everyone gets that analogy, right? No? Look it up), Spurlock becomes a fearless explorer in and around the Middle East, searching for this dangerous killer. But what starts out as a journey of righteousness turns more into a discovery of the differences that divide the Muslim world from itself, from western religious doctrine, and from the policies of the U.S.. This is where things went a bit haywire for the film. Although most viewers will probably be forgiving of this since journeys like this often lead down other paths, it still felt awkward as Spurlock jumped around between political dignitaries, religious fanatics (on both sides), and U.S. ground-based troops in Afghanistan and how they felt about the war effort.It is commendable that Spurlock used animation (like the aforementioned Carmen Sandiego) to get his point across. The silliness of the animation was meant to show how crazy his quest might seem to us but, in the end, it comes across as something he simply had to do ...if not for his future kid, then for himself and the rest of us who live his experience vicariously.The ending is a pretty big letdown and it didn't line-up very well with the beginning of the film. Seeing the alternate ending on the dvd, I really feel it would've been a much better true ending to the documentary.Still, this is a very topical issue that shows not just one man's quest for answers, but a challenge to the U.S. that shows how close one man can come to finding Osama. Perhaps the U.S. military really doesn't want to find this madman. What reason would we have then for staying over there? Oil? Of course not!",N/A
731304,"Bliss is a powerful and absorbing movie which explore the nature of adult sexuality and love. The plot revolves around the relationship of a newly married yuppie couple,Steve and Maria.We quickly discover that Maria is a compulsive neurotic bordering on the psychotic who is already in therapy and who soon reveals herself to be incapable of having an orgasm. Although an acutely sensitive person she is essentially very loving and copes by faking it. This leads her and eventually her husband to meet with Baltazzar, a sex therapist played with a beguiling calm charisma by Terence Stamp.They thus begin a difficult journey leading to some very important discoveries about themselves. On this journey the Director, Lance Young, engages strongly with such themes as the very nature of sex and love and our capacity to fully give.Steve is a reasonably sensitive man, but like most men has to deal with a strong sexual libido and a dominant male culture which encourages us to put its satisfaction first.His journey is therefore towards increasing awareness and selflessness which ultimately brings its own rewards as he begins to understand the nature of real love and to be able to give and receive it.The sex we see is never gratuitous and has an emotional reality which is rooted in the context of this developing relationship. It is light years away from porn and the simplistic banality of much Hollywood sexual depiction. I suspect many men will be challenged by it in the same way Steve was by the situation he found himself faced with, but it is a journey worth taking.Craig Sheffer and Sheryl Lee give performances as the young couple which ultimately draw us into the movie,but it is Stamp who holds the film together supported by an engaging and often beautiful sound track that heightens its mood.There is a nice twist at the end when Baltazzar embarks on his own new relationship and Steve wryly reflects on the difference between giving advice and putting it into practice with someone you love and whose personality you therefore accept as part of the deal.A film for adults with open hearts and minds.

I likewise loved the lighter but still penetrating, satirical, sometimes wickedly insightful laughs in Extras.Having said that, I must confess I didn't expect much from Ricky's Hollywood foray into romantic comedy and I didn't go see it at the theatre.  Well, it turns out that Ricky, again playing an initially unsympathetic character, just has comedy chops that work for me and I very much enjoyed Ghost Town.He is ably accompanied by Greg Kinnear who is always solid, and by Tea Leoni who is not only lovely but has a nice comedic touch herself.

442154,"Alligator People is a good example of a 50s-era horror movie with some clear ""B-movie"" limitations, but is nevertheless a fun flick.The plot involves a newlywed's search for her husband after his mysterious disappearance.  After some clever sleuthing, she tracks him down to a grand old house deep in the Louisiana swamps.  Unbeknowst to her, the husband has been suffering from some peculiar side effects from an experimental treatment he received for a catastrophic injury.  For a clue as to the particular side effects...well, look at the title.Like a lot of its 50's counterparts, the horror in this movie comes from a fear of the dangers of ""Science"".  I agree with others who compare this movie to ""The Fly"", but with one difference.  In that movie,  Science is inherently impossible to control, but ""Alligator People"" portrays a hopeful potential to overcome the dangers of Science which is ultimately thwarted by the irrational side of humanity (personified in this case by the alligator-phobe hick living in a swamp shack played by Lon Chaney, Jr.).OK, enough film theory.  The weaknesses of this movie include: (1) too much filler -- the exposition-heavy talking scenes are a little too prevalent, (2) the inclusion of a psychiatric analysis of the wife which bookends the main story and is awkward and unnecessary, and (3) the special effects of the creature which are a little, uh, underwhelming.  The final transformation is more humorous than frightening (not exactly ""Creature of the Black Lagoon"" here folks).Fortunately, the movie works because of the prominence of Beverly Garland.  She goes through the whole range of human emotions here and comes off as a very likable and intelligent character (not too hard on the eyes either).Also the deep south bayou-feel of the movie adds a tremendous atmosphere which is another big plus.Finally, the soundtrack's score by Irving Gertz is very effective.

So, I write this review with a heavy heart.Second, I was always looking for the Old School content on this DVD.  I would rather Elmo and the post-racial rainbow kids had never been invented.  Roosevelt Franklin, writers who met social, racial and class conditions head-on, the music of Joe Raposo--this is what I wanted.How disappointing.  There is a minimum of new material from the Old School DVD collections.  And Joe Raposo's name is not even prominent (is it even mentioned?) in the book that accompanies the DVDs.  I'll have to read it again, but Jon Stone is fronted and Raposo is definitely in the background.Anyway, I'll just have to keep hoping that the marketing gurus at Sesame Wallet Project see fit in the future to release our childhood memories more systematically and completely.

Human beings were NOT meant to sit in a cubicle for 8+ hours/day, under fluorescent lights,  suffering through pointless meetings, and singing halfhearted birthday greetings to coworkers who you secretly wish would just drop dead.Too cowardly to quit, we sit in our cubes and become obese and depressed. Then we get laid off and sit at home being obese and depressed.Decades from now, this film will be remembered as a symbol of late 20th-century life, and of our general willingness to sell out.

1106405,"The reviewers who complained about the length of this adaptation of the famous D.H. Lawrence novel need to be reminded that shortening the film would have meant seeing less of the beautiful and adorable Marina Hands, and how exactly is that a good thing?  As to the pace being too slow, that complaint stems from a failure to understand whose point of view we are seeing.  Hint: the title.  The pace is what it is to be consistent with the timeframe of a woman's natural emotional reactions to major life events, especially relative to the period of the film.  The setting is very Eden-like and the protagonists are a variation on Adam and Eve minus the theological baggage, so isn't this a story one wishes would never end?  If anything, I wish the film had been even longer!As a francophile, I'm probably biased when I say that every romantic story works better in French -- the subtitles are adequate, by the way.  Hearing English names pronounced with a French accent didn't bother me at all, on the contrary, I found it rather charming.  I thought the resolution was appropriate.

557197,"'The Patriot' is a superb war story about the American Revolutionary War.It features superb acting by Mel Gibson (as Col. Benjamin Martin), Heath Ledger (Gabriel Martin) and Jason Isaacs as British Col. William Tavington.  The supporting cast does a great job as well.This one is set in South Carolina in 1776-1781.  Martin is a widowed farmer who is just trying to raise his children while the patriots of the area are preparing for war.  He wants no part of it but is forced into it by by the brutal killing of his young son and other atrocities by Tavington.  The Tavington character seems to be based on General Banastre Tarleton well known for his atrocities.  Lest readers worry that the film is falsely portraying the Brits, that is not the case.  Most of them are portrayed as noble warriors, but Tavington (Tarleton) deserves his place in infamy.Also, this is not as documentary.  It is a work of fiction that is very well done.This is highly recommended for anyone who loves a great war movie, particularly one about the Revolutionary War which is seldom depicted in the movies.",N/A

1287282,"The best way to view this film is without knowing anything about it. Truly, it is best going into this completely blind. If you love watching something with an original spin on things, I really think this film has what you want. I mean, how often is it that you see a film where the aliens are the ones kept underneath the humans, treated like the lowest of the low, basically forced to live in their own filth? And that is just the setup to this really cool film. The actors are complete unknowns- and do a fantastic job, especially the lead. The movie itself, filmed quite inexpensively compared to just about anything nowadays, is filled with ridiculously awesome and realistic effects that makes Transformers 2 look like a video game.The reason I fell in love with District 9 is because this particular brand of Sci-Fi isn't just about effects and aliens and coverups. It actually has a plot, and a heart, so to speak. The humans you learn to despise and the aliens you completlely sympathize with. It's not a common occurance. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, so I will just say that the reason I did not give this film 5 stars is because of how it ended. I wasn't dissatisfied, per se, but I thought it a tad predictable, and is clearly screaming for a sequel. Either way though, District 9 is a great film, and certainly one of the better ones from 2009.",N/A
855610,"The Princess And The Pea is a charming installment in this ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" series of DVDs for children. The plot moves along at a pace that will keep a child interested; and I thought the acting was very well done, particularly on the part of Tom Conti who plays Prince Richard. The cinematography works well and the quality of the print is rather good.When the action starts, Queen Veronica (Beatrice Straight) and her silly, ineffectual husband King Fredrico (Pat McCormick) are being their pompous selves, almost oblivious to the needs of their son Prince Richard. With a little bit of help from the court jester (or, ""the fool,"" played by Tim Kazurinsky), Richard decides he wants to marry a Princess so his life will be truly complete. Unfortunately for Prince Richard, his mother Queen Veronica takes complete charge of the search for a suitable Princess and this drives poor Richard to distraction.They interview many potential princesses; but none come up except for Princess Elizabeth (Nancy Allen) who, as we quickly find out, wants to merely use Prince Richard as a way to become a Queen herself someday. Richard doesn't like this; and he begins to consider a rather vagabond type of Princess named Alecia (Liza Minnelli) who has been staying at the castle after twisting her ankle.Of course, things can run in different directions from here. Queen Veronica and King Fredrico don't even know Princess Alecia has been staying the past few days in the castle while her ankle was recuperating--how will they react when they find out Alecia has been staying with them? Prince Richard and the court ""fool"" had been keeping it a secret. Will Alecia pass ""the test"" that Queen Veronica wants her to pass to prove to them all that she is indeed a suitable princess for her son Richard? Can Princess Alecia feel a single tiny pea underneath twenty mattresses and quilts to prove her royal heritage? Watch and find out!The DVD doesn't come with extras unless you count ""scene selection"" as an extra. I don't; but that's no problem because this is geared toward children and I don't know that the typical four year old would reap all the benefits from a running commentary anyway.I highly recommend this film for children and it's nice to be able to watch this with your children. It's great entertainment and I am only too sorry that this individual DVD is currently out of print. However, if you or your children enjoy this, you should consider getting Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collection and perhaps also Faerie Tale Theatre: Tales from the Brothers Grimm.",N/A

917608,"Cheryl is a pretty teenage runaway who is tired of being treated like a kid. When her former friend throws Cheryl out of their apartment for peeping on her sex romps one too many times, she finds herself alone in L.A. and in need of a place to stay. Luckily, her Aunt Martha is the proprietor of the King Edward Hotel, so Cheryl looks her up. A bit reluctantly, repressed Aunt Martha takes Cheryl in with a half friendly, half disapproving tone. To Cheryl's fascination, the King Edward is full of weirdos, but one in particular catches her eye, and vice versa. As the film rolls along, we get caught up in the mutual obsession between Cheryl and a sexually-confused/disturbed young photographer, and also the series of grizzly murders taking place in the hotel to keep some untold secret. Everything comes together in the end, naturally, and it's quite a tale!Not to be confused with the 1997 Howard Stern bio-pic of the same name, 1972's ""Private Parts"" is pure grindhouse slashsploitation fare conjured with oddball characters, nudity and perversion, graphic violence, and goofy humor. The performances are all over the map, but you'll see some familiar faces too, including ""My Three Sons'"" own Chip Douglas, Stanley Livingston, as the nice guy who's the closest this film gets to having a hero. Ayn Ruymen plays Cheryl wonderfully and even looks pretty good in the two or three scenes where she doesn't look overly thin. God bless cute, implant-free, pink puffies! If you like '70's horror flicks and would rather have a bit more plot development and suspense than sheer, mindless body-count, you should find this one to be a winner. ""Private Parts"" is entertainingly messed up, but it's a good movie too. Not as campy as some may describe it. The DVD is nothing special: widescreen presentation and the theatrical trailer that reveals too much (but is still awesome, because those grindhouse-type trailers just are). It's the bare minimum for an acceptable DVD, but I'm glad to have it. I recommend it if it's up your alley, and you ought to know if it is.",Private Parts

Boy did they lose out because if this had a national release it would've done gangbusters at the box office. For one thing: it's actually scary. Two: the gore is gross and intense. Three: the performances are shockingly good across the board. Vinnie Jones is awesome as the villain, and although the story maybe vague at times, but it all comes together at the end.

The funereal pace and lack of action is further amplified by Russell Currie's dissonant music score, which fails to bolster the visuals in a constructive manner. Still, some viewers will get a kick out of the creepy setting and sudden flashes of violence, and there's an excellent cast, toplined by Jack Davenport (THE TALENTED MR.

1171972,"In early December 2002, a young Afghani named Dilawar picked up three passengers destined for his hometown, but he never made it there, and he never saw his family again. He was rounded up in a sweep by the US military and incarcerated in Bagram Prison where he was designated as a PUC, or person under control. Deprived of sleep and shackled to an overhang, which prevented him from falling asleep because of the pressure it would put on one's wrists, he began crying out for his mother and father. American soldiers tried to shut him up by kicking him with their knees to the fleshy part of his thighs. Every one of them got their ""kicks"" and Dalawar died in custody, the second man in as many weeks. He weighed 122 lbs at the time of his death. The coroner listed his death as a homicide. She would later testify that his legs had been ""pulpified."" They would have had to have been amputated had he survived. His family was given his body and a death certificate--in English.Dilawar is the beginning story of this fascinating video about an American policy of torture that has taken place in Afghanistan, Abu Ghraib in Iraq, and at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay. I kept watching this sickening story over and over again with the disbelief that Americans could institute cruelty as evil as what Nazis, Japanese, and Koreans had perpetrated against us and our allies, evils that we have executed past tormentors for.The enlisted personnel involved make it clear, usually in their own words, that the beatings, deaths in custody, and torture were not random acts of rogue sadists men who decided to act on their own. They were encouraged to torture and humiliate with the tacit approval of their command and from Washington D. C. to commit these acts.As the video shows, it begins with Dick Cheney, telling Tim Russert on ""Meet the Press"" that we [Americans] have to turn to the dark side to gather in intelligence in the same manner that our enemies do, and do whatever it takes to get it. This televised interview takes place one week after 9/11.Next, Alberto Gonzalez writes a policy declaring Afghanistan a failed state. Therefore, he concludes, Article III of the Geneva Conventions does not apply. Anyone taken into custody will not be treated as a prisoner of war.Mild-mannered John Yoo of the Justice Department belies his soft-spoken nature by doing the rest. He writes an opinion for the White House that states torture can only occur if it results in organ failure or death. (The only problem is that it is too late to realize that you have tortured someone if you achieve one or the other). But, Yoo goes further offering another opinion that the President of the United States can do virtually anything he wants, and it will not be outside the law.Donald Rumsfeld joins in with a memorandum in which he pens, ""What's wrong with standing 4 hours? I stand 10-12 hours a day."" This means the gloves are off, and officers and enlisted men who seek guidance on what limits they have are never given any. They are told to get actionable intelligence, and get it fast. The torture begins.Detainees are stripped naked upon arrival, given cavity searches, and disoriented by darkness and loud sounds. They are then put into isolation and deprived of sleep. (The sleep deprivation boards that list how much time to let a detainee sleep or how long to keep him awake will be removed during International Red Cross inspections). Some will be beaten or water-boarded. The latter makes the victim feel he is suffocating through drowning. And as studies in the 1950s had shown, depriving a person of stimuli, visual and auditory could induce psychosis in as little as two days. Visiting generals and SecDef, Donald Rumsfeld compliment the staff on the fine job they are doing.Policy is based upon a belief that such treatment will startle the victim into talking, and he will tell the truth. This is tried with one victim who states Saddam Hussein is acquiring nuclear weapons, and that there is a connection between Saddam and Osama bin-Laden, information he is prodded to give through waterboarding. His ""confession"" will be rushed to the White House and to Colin Powell, in time for his speech before the United Nations. It will become further proof that torture does not provide accurate information.In Hamden v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court writes an opinion of outrage declaring that Americans are entitled to habeas corpus and detainees must be accorded the status of Prisoners of War. President Bush is furious. He quotes the Geneva Convention: ""'...outrages upon human dignity.' That's vague! What does that mean?""While the Supreme Court thwarts George Bush and Dick Cheney, they are still capable of playing the scoundrels. They threaten to withhold the support of the conservative base of the Republican party from John McCain in his presidential bid, unless he supports the Military Commission Act of 2006. This law bypasses the Supreme Court decision by allowing the accused to have their trials, but they will not be released from custody unless the White House says so. There is also a provision that pardons the President, the Vice President, Rumsfeld and a number of generals from prosecution for torture. It does not include enlisted men.More than a dozen investigations begin with all them aiming downward, not one officer is convicted by a court martial. Instead of the President following the recommendation that Major General Miller be disciplined for bringing his Guantanamo style of incarceration to Abu-Ghraib, he is awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and retires.Our military picked up seven percent of the detainees. Ninety-three percent were turned over to the US by forces of the Northern Alliance, Pakistan, or from neighbors who were eager to get the $5,000 bounty that the US government was offering. This also allowed the snitch to take over the neighbor's farm or poppy crop. There have been 87,000 detainees in American custody. Not one of them has been brought to trial.The Northern Alliance guard who turned in Dilawar, the taxi driver was himself later brought to custody for having directed fire against US bases, and for having turned in innocent victims after each attack.This DVD should not be missed. It will command your attention. It should be burned into your memory forever. It should serve as a reminder that being American does not exclude one from becoming a Nazi, and if we don't hold our leaders accountable, we are no different than they are.In twelve more days and a wake-up we should start finding more answers.This is dedicated to Army Specialist Joseph M.

Since Charles Band seems to direct most Full Moon films anyhow, I'm kinda curious as to why there is a Charles Band Collection Vol 1.  Maybe he hand picked these four films as a good representation of his work, or maybe they are his favorite films.  It doesn't really matter I suppose, coz what we have here is a mixed bag of Full Moon films.Meridian is a Beauty and the Beast type story.  Sherilyn Fenn moves to a castle in Italy where there are a bunch of oddball carnival performers hanging around her property.  One of them is a guy who turns into a werewolf-like beast every time he gets jiggy with Sherilyn(can't say I blame him, I probably would too).  There's a mystery about some family curse and other nonsense.  It's not so much of a horror film as it is some kind of erotic fantasy deal.  It's not too bad though.Crash and Burn is a post apocalyptic tale of a bunch of people trapped inside a television station-which is a front for a revolutionary headquarters-who come under attack by a cyborg assassin played by Bill Moseley.  Also not a bad film.Doctor Mordrid has Jeffrey Combs as a sorcerer guarding the gate to our dimension from his apartment.  An evil rival sorcerer played by Brian Thompson(he's that mean looking brute who played the evil cult leader in Cobra with Stallone) has plans to take over Earth, but he has to get through Doctor Mordrid first!!  This is a fun movie.  It's silly as hell of course, but you can't help but enjoy it, especially with Combs playing a hero in a tight blue outfit with a cape.  From what I understand, Full Moon wanted to do a film based on the Marvel comic character Dr. Strange, but couldn't get the rights or something.And finally Head of the Family is a goofy horror/comedy about a guy trying to blackmail a rich family of oddities to do his bidding.  The ""Head"" of the family is literally a head with arms.  A better movie than it probably should be, and much wittier than you'd think.None of these films look like they've been remastered or cleaned up in any way.

102800,"This movie is Steven Seagal's first and best.  ""Above the Law"" features Steven Seagal as Nico Toscani.  A tough, edgy police officer who once was a Special Ops agent in the Vietnam War.  The movie starts off as a montage of moments early in Nico's life.(which coincidentally mirrors Seagal's own youth).  From there, we move onto the Vietnam War, and then to present day Chicago of 1988.  Nico is partnered with Dolores Jackson (Pam Grier) as they become involved in a case involving a drug shipment.  When the bad guys are busted, the Chicago police and the Feds discover a cache of C-4 explosives.  Eventually, Nico and Dolores discover a CIA conspiracy where they are dealing in narcotics trafficking to fund their covert operations.  A Central American priest has paperwork to bust this operation, and it is up to Nico to uncover this dastardly plot.Steven Seagal gives his best performance of his dubious career as he plays a relentless cop trying to bust the villains.  Pam Grier is his supportive partner.  Sharon Stone is also in the film as Seagal's wife.  And the main villain is Henry Silva (Zagon), who has played numerous villains in the various films he has been in.The fight scenes are very believable, with things and people being broken constantly.  My favorite scenes are the aikido sparring session at the beginning, and when the 4 busters pull up in a convertible to confront Nico.  The scene ends with this huge guy coming up to Nico, and he fells him with a double blow to the chest and stomach.DVD Extra's:* The Special Features section is a bit thin.  The ""Cast & Crew"" has some bios on the various actors.  It was interesting that the opening scene of the movie followed Steven Seagal's youth, and that Seagal has black belts in Karate, Aikido, and Kendo.  ""Behind the Scenes"" just featured a couple of pages of text on the movie.  ""Theatrical Trailers"" had 8 trailers of Steven Seagal movies.I have always enjoyed this movie.

Nunc dimittis! Age has not withered it; if anything, the whole series has a wonderful freshness about it, It is certainly delightul to watch Judi Dench, Robert Hardy and Sean Connery in their early years ( Back then, I thought Sean Connery somewhat wooden; not now: one almost expects him to pop up with, ""Hotspur, James Hotspur!"")What struck me most forcibly-it came during one of the Henry VI plays-was the fitting nature of the whole concept: even back in the '60s I had noticed how small the interiors were and it was obvious that even the exteriors were studio shot, but seeing a picture of the model of the set brought home that this was not merely production economy: in Henry V the Chorus asks, ""...pardon, gentles all,/ The flat unraised spirits that hath dar'd/On rhia unworthy scaffold to bring forth/ So great an object."" This is the genius of the whole series: Shakespeare had his wooden O and the BBC devoutly and appropriately set the whole Age on those terms.The acting, for such an epic, is uniformly fine; no need to duplicate other reviewers, In true repertory tradition, actors appear and reappear in different roles; I sometimes wondered how Geoffrey Bayldon kept track of who he was playing!And isn't it wonderful that through the magic of DVD, we don't have to wait a week between episodes any more!",Shakespeare's An Age of Kings: (Richard II / Henry IV / Henry V / Henry VI / Richard III)
241223,"Obviously any film is never going to be as good as your imagination when reading a really well written book but this movie comes pretty close.  For those who don't know this is based on the classic taleThe Shrinking Manby Richard Matheson.  Incidentally if you add the word Incredible when looking for the book you will find an anthology collection with The Shrinking Man and other stories such as Duel in it.A few things do date the movie a little such as the usual cheap sounding 50s thriller soundtrack and you can tell at times when there's a blue screen being used, but you rarely can.  Whoever built the robot cat used in some scenes at the start of the film obviously didn't know the difference between cats and dogs as it wagged its tail canine style.  You can understand why they had to make a cat when you see the really bad acting by the real cat in later scenes involving a dolls house (obviously shot first).  This feline actor overuses Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!! a fair bit when a real life stalking prey cat is unlikely to do it even once.  Haven't seen that cat in anything else so it obviously never got a call back for other films. The humans' acting though cannot be faulted.For those who have read the book there are a few differences.  The daughter from the book is not in the movie.  The movie is set in chronological order as opposed to the book which has a lot of flashbacks and time wise starts in the basement with the encounter with the redback spider / black widow depending on where you're from, (it's a tarantula in the movie probably as they were scarier back then).  In fact there's a lot less tension in the movie with the spider (and it's not missing a leg done by Scott when he was normal sized in the book) and his home in the basement didn't really look like it would keep out the spider but other than that, the massive props are really well done, you actually get the feeling he is that small.  The movie still captures the what would you an average person do in this situation which is Matheson's specialty. It also captures Scott's mental breakdown but doesn't really touch on the what's the point of fighting to stay alive he often debated.  In the book he also has worked out as he halves every certain number of days he will completely disappear in x amount, which again he uses to debate if he should just give up constantly in the book, however the movie makers didn't use this main book trait at all.Basic plot of the film is after his boat floats through a strange mist, Scott Carey slowly begins to shrink.  Doctors can't work out why and he soon becomes something to point at, a freak to ridicule, by the community.  Life as he knows it is over, he feels more and more alienated the smaller he gets.  As he gets smaller and smaller more things become dangerous to him. What would you do in this situation?A few props aren't the right size (way too big) such as the salt and paper shakers, sugar shaker and coffee mug in the circus midget using them scenes. Other than that you can't really fault this film.  A very well done film, I still rate it five stars even with the bad acting by the cat and other minor faults.  Wish we could say this for the latest movie adaptation of Matheson'sI am Legend. Another early film era movie done really well of a classic novel isThe Invisible Mana good likeness to H G Wells' classic novel of the same name.",N/A
711606,"This is a set of DVD's that I'd been waiting to get my hands on ever since the orginal HBO airings of the mini-series; but once it came out, I didn't have the huevos to put out that kind of money. But it's mine now, so for those few who've never seen it, here's a brief synopsis. Produced by Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List), this is one for the history books...literally. It's the true story of Easy Company, an airborne division that air dropped behind enemy lines the night before D-Day. Their history is detailed from the night of the drop through their final action of taking Hitler's Bertchesgarten (the Eagle's Nest, his mountain retreat). What separates this from the multitude of WW II movies is that, before each episode, surviving members of Easy Company at time of filming told their personal stories. As time continues, anyone involved in any theatre of the campaign will be gone; and it's that personal history that needs...MUST be preserved.Great soundtrack, very realistic; to the last detail. Very well researched and documented.Drawbacks: Price (it ain't your bargain bin product yet, but you get a lot of for what you pay!). The battle scenes are graphic, but war isn't pretty; and I'm glad the producers opted for real rather than sterile. I'm not a fan of the ""handicam"" view, as it causes a vertigo feeling when you view it (at least to me; make your own conclusions). It's long, but best viewed in one sitting...hard to do, but worth your time.If you don't get that lump-in-your-throat, misty-eyed feeling during this film, check your heart and make sure you still have one!Make it a tradition to watch this on on Memorial Day, at the minimum. Honor those who have made it possible for you to be here in the first place, let alone to see it in relative freedom. God bless the men of Easy Company, the veterans of every war, and those still fighting today for their country and for the sake of others; and for the ideals of freedom and democracy.",N/A

1230178,"It's great to finally have the opportunity to review this spectacular concert DVD and CD. The clarity of the audio recording and the picture itself is  amazing, and they didn't hack the concert in the editing room when it was put from DVD to CD. You get almost the entire audio recording on the CD, including most of the verbal contact Sarah has with the audience. I think this CD is 100 times better than the Harem World Tour CD recording, which makes this package a totally worthwhile purchase. The photos are stunning and the printing of the glossy booklet make everything look so nice. The DVD is purple and the CD is black, with silver lettering on both. As for the artwork of the DVD insert, there is silver lettering on both front and back. The interview with some of the Cathedral's staff is really nice and they show just how appreiative they were of having Sarah perform in their majestic historical building.Sarah's costumes and hair are gorgeous and she is definitely glowing and looking more pretty than ever. There is one small difference from the studio recording of ""Fleurs Du Mal"" and the recording in this package. What I'm saying is...Sarah doesn't do that high-pitched vocalise while the violin solo comes in in the intro of the song, compared to the studio album recording. I wonder if it would've wrecked the intro to the song if she did sing it while moving down the middle aisle.""Sanvean"" written by Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance) is a beautiful vocalise consisting of no lyrics but just sounds. That is what I love about this song. It's just so haunting and original, and Sarah does it very well, even if some say she's too breathy. ""Canto Della Terra"" is beautiful and Alessandro Safina looks and sounds amazing as Sarah's duet partner. Together, they blow everyone away with their breathtaking live rendition of the song. ""Atessa"" is very pretty and much better than expected. It really doesn't appear they used any playback for this concert, meaning Sarah used her own voice for the whole recording. I was actually expecting Atessa to be dubbed from the studio recording because of that very outstanding high note at th end, which is incredibly hard to do without screaming it.""POTO"" turned out to be quite nice, although it was a little too fast-paced compared to the original version. But the rock concert edge gives it a totally new edge and Sarah was still able to sing over the volume of the rock band and the pipe organ high above her and Chris Thompson. Oh, that reminds me, my only negative comment would be....Chris Thompson looks like someone they dragged off the street to duet with Sarah. He sounded a little tired in ""I will be with you"". He sounded winded although he still had a rock edge to his voice...and to his style. But, on ""POTO"" he and Sarah really blew me away when I watched the performance for the 1st time.It's really wonderful to have this beautiful DVD&CD; package and I'll cherish it for many years to come. This is by far, Sarah's best live performance on DVD, to date...although there are some really amazing live performances on her other live DVDs. But this one really showcases Sarah's live singing voice, and how well she can work with a rock band. Get this item and you'll agree, it's totally worth the wait and the money.",N/A

1226111,"I know it's been said a million times already and I hate to sound clich&eacute;, but it's a statement that rings true every time you say it. Who would have thought Danny Boyle, a man from Manchester could have created such an award winning phenomenon. Slumdog Millionaire is a film I tried to keep away from as long as possible as I didn't want to seem like a person who jumps on the bandwagon. I guess it was inevitable that I was to see it eventually and tonight was the night. It has remained in my memory for a few hours so far and that lump in my throat has yet to subside. From start to finish I was completely engrossed and I have decided that those saying negative things about this picture are ones trying a bit too hard to steer clear of that dreaded wagon.So the story itself is based around 3 main characters, 4 if you count the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" host. Jamal the main character starts off in a police station as he is accused of cheating to win the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" big 20 Rupees prize. Determined to prove his innocence to the Police, he starts telling them the stories of situations in his life which taught him the answers to the questions which he has inadvertently remembered for all that time. What we get to see as the game show progresses are a number of different defining events in Jamals childhood that are in one way heart breaking and in another heart warming.He and his brother Salim remained very close to one another from birth and stuck together after their mother was killed. One night after the murder of their mother, they were sleeping in a container as protection from the rain and they met a girl named Latika. Jamal took this companionship from one of his favourite books and labelled them the Three Musketeers, although they could never remember the name of the third after Athos and Porthos. Salim's relationship is never too favourable towards Latika until they get older and after being split up at the still very early age, they meet up many years later and events get worse and worse with Salim raping Latika.There are other events that take place which I will not spoil for the sake of your enjoyment, so I will now comment on the other amazing parts of the film. The acting was superb throughout and brought some genuinely surprising choices and showed us what they were capable of. Of course the young and teenage versions of Salim, Jamal and Latika were superb but unfortunately attracted accusations of these Indian child actors being taken advantage of. Whether they were or not doesn't take anything away from their fantastic performances. The adult versions of the three characters are played by the fantastically surprising Dev Patel (Jamal), Freida Pinto (Latika) and Madhur Mittal (Salim). Each delivered an astonishing performance, especially from the wonderful Dev Patel known originally to myself as Anwar from Skins in the UK.The film was set mostly on location which allowed for the true tragedy of the Mumbai slums to be captured in all their glory. There have been things I've read that accuse Danny Boyle's picture of being demonising of the life in the slums. I don't know how you can demonise actual conditions being shown as they are, if anything I believe this is more complementary of the life in the slums. Although you could imagine it to be a very poor and dirty area, the slums are shot in a way that looks very artistic and in some senses quite beautiful. The soundtrack complements this immensely and I think without such spectacular music behind it, I think I would have had a whole different perspective on the film.To those steering clear of the film because of its massive award success, I have only one thing to say. You're idiots, the lot of you. This is a beautifully artistic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all film fans alike. I could talk for hours about the psychological implications of the life suffered by the children in this picture, but I have chosen not too. It's a brilliant film that I know as long as you give it a chance, you will love it.",N/A

1209649,"""Up"" is an oddly incongruous film from Pixar in that it has primarily adult themes but a relatively simple visual style and an over-the-top adventure plot. Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) is an elderly widower who had always dreamed with his wife Ellie of far-flung adventures. In particular, they wanted to visit ""Paradise Falls"" in South America, where their childhood hero, an adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), made his name. Before he is forced into a retirement home, Carl takes one last shot at his dream. He attaches about 20,000 helium balloons to his house, hoists some sails, and sets the house aloft. But Carl has an unintended guest: an boy named Russell (Jordan Nagai), overeager to get his Wilderness Explorer ""Helping the Elderly Badge"", is on the porch.Carl and Russell have only a few days to deposit the house atop Paradise Falls before the balloons deflate. The boy's idealism and enthusiasm clash with Carl's sense of urgency. Russell befriends a giant bird and a talking dog named Dug (Bob Petersen) but cannot understand Carl's increasing desperation. Carl is an old man who feels the pressure of very limited time to fulfill his life's dream, and at first he doesn't' have much patience with Russell's cheerful but easily distracted temperament. Now, this is entertaining to watch, but how much would a child understand or care about Carl's problem? ""Up"" does not limit its appeal to children, as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"" did, but I wonder if it has not done the opposite and taken on themes that are irrelevant to children.I hope this will not spoil the movie for anyone, but I feel compelled to mention the strangest thing about this film: There is a man living in the jungle who is right out of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"". He is worshiped and served by a group of violent primitives (in this case domesticated dogs), and he collects the heads (in this case helmets) of those who have dared trespass his little fiefdom, whom we assume he has killed. He's an intelligent, accomplished man whose mind has gone `round the bend. He's Kurtz. Should I be surprised to see a Kurtz character in a ""family film""? There is nothing graphic about ""Up"", and I don't think this guy is any scarier than a typical Pixar villain. ""Up"" is an entertaining film, though it lacks the visual interest and innovation that I've come to expect from Pixar (it was intended to be shown in 3D). I just wonder what children will make of it.",N/A
998247,"""Akeelah and the Bee"" is one of the finest and most enjoyable films I've seen in years. There are many messages for kids to learn, regarding self-worth, peer pressure and making positive choices in one's life at a young age. There's little I can say that hasn't been said, but I'd like to address a few issues that were brought to mind. First, I really believe that the public educational systems are doing their best to encourage the kids. Societal pressures to be ""cool"" often, I think, have prevented many young people from realizing potential. Also, parents are as much a force in the educational development of kids as the teachers. There is a balance that must be maintained, and knowing your kids' strengths and weaknesses. Certainly, Akeelah's mother had issues that kept her from initially knowing the passion of her child to succeed. The Korean kid's father also had selfish issues. Finding that fine line is tough; parenting is tough. Also, this could be about any child who is in a less than affluent household. The fact that Akeelah is Black is incidental. That said, I simply can't believe that this film by Doug Atchison won only a few awards. The acting is without any weak spot; Fishburne and Bassett are fresh and in touch with their material (as in ""What's Love Got to Do with It"", where Oscar recognized both with noms). The amazingly auspicious debut of Keke Palmer as Akeelah can only be regarded as brilliant, and a huge ? in those awards choices. The excellent screenplay and editing kept things in perspective.This film is suspenseful, endearing, humorous, insightful...and the lessons to be learned can only be a positive influence on all who see it. MOST highly recommended.",N/A

Watching this film it was easy to see that it undeniably had to be influential in the art direction and cinematography for the ripper film ""From Hell"" (2001), and even for the opening scene in ""Time After Time"" (1979). This film presents a pretty interesting whodunit story with great acting, great suspense, and great visuals. It also finishes out the story with a pulse-pounding finale. The murder scenes and the (for it's time) blatant sexuality of the ""ladies of the evening"" garnered it an X rating in the United Kingdom.

Then there are his memories, which interweave with reality and are so indistinguishable from it that at times the viewer is uncertain what has really happened.  Much of it is bizarre and surrealistic, a collage of the unresolved, the loved, the pressing need, the hope.  It is all in Mastroianni's expression, which is impassive yet full.  Everything is grotesque yet understated and subtle.He feels besieged, overwhelmed as so many people keep coming at him, and yet he tries to see his way forward.

Her dizzy Aunt Hortense (Alice Brady) hires Guy's friend Egbert(Edward Everett Horton) as Mimi's attorney.After a misunderstanding at a customs hall in England, Mimi is resistant to Guy's attempts to woo her. At the hotel where they are both staying, Guy and Mimi dance to Cole Porter's ""Night and Day"". After the spectacular dance, we see that Mimi is finally coming around,becoming smitten with him.Things become complicated when Egbert hires a paid correspondent,Tonetti(the very funny Erik Rhodes) to help Mimi get her divorce. Mimi mistakes Guy for the correspodent, leading to many misunderstandings that have to be resolved before the happy ending can be acheived.There is much to enjoy in this movie. Yes, the plot is the type that only happens in musicals. But it sophisticated and funny. The dancing is superb. The songs themselves are excellent too. Fred's rendition of ""Night and Day"" is the defintive performance of it.""Let's Knock Knees"", sung by the then unknown Betty Grable, is a charming moment. And the 17- minute production number ""The Continental"" is an eye-popping spectacle that won the first ever Oscar awarded for best song.""The Gay Divorcee"" was a big hit in its time, moving Fred And Ginger up to fourth position on the list of box office stars. It also received four other Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.The supporting cast is outstanding. Brady's dizzy dame act is a riot. A subplot teams her romantically with Horton. Horton's fussy character is well matched with hers.Look for Eric Blore, who appears in five Astaire-Rogers muscials, as waiter who steals his scenes when he appears.The DVD includes the theatrical trailer, and an audio-only presentation of an old radio show promoting the film.

This movie might have been better. It might have been a lot worse. Sharp dialogue, frenetic action sequences and first-rate special effects save this long-awaited adaptation from certain doom.Stephen Spielberg, executive producer to Michael Bay's immense cinematic gamble, pitched the idea to the studio as ""a story about a boy and his car..."" It's this humble idea that is key to the screenplay's success.But if you're a die-hard fan of the highly inventive robot characters developed during the original ""G1"" 1980s toyline and accompanying cartoon...don't hold your breath.

So, they enlarge this, decide to destroy the volume and audio clarity, then omit several episodes from the original broadcast. You cant even HEAR the narration; they enhance audio that isnt even from the same clip they show.In 2056 minutes, about one third to one-half are blurry and ruined film clips, somne are propaganda films that are presented as real events. It's easy to identify them because THEY SHOW THE SAME CLIPS OVER AND OVER IN EVERY THIRD EPISODE. If you REALLY want to see this, rent it from the library for free, watch online, or buy the VHS or DVD episodes...Blu ray is just asinine!

It's hollow and all bling, with nothing in the center.Now for the FACTS:Not ONE historian nor the National Holocaust Museum believes there is ANY evidence of human leather lampshades or book covers, yet this has never been updated, and still presented along with shrunken heads, and so on.The massacre at Katyn Forest was blamed on the Germans for years, until the Russians admitted it when damning evidence was found on microfiche the Russians ""forgot about"".This video was shot with the PREMISE of a dramatic presentation of history but not only does it fail, it trumps greed over fact.I watched this when it was shown in the early 80's with a TV warning after each commercial about strong content. This made me feel like I was being taught to hate Germans and at the same time love the Soviets, who are accused of killing a dozen times more people than Hitler did.To top it off, they insert a silly ""interview"" with a man I dont believe was ever in a camp, nor seen one unless he is a complete imbecile. He was a barber, and he said he was shaving all the jewish womens hair and he was to save it for the SS, whom made mattress stuffing from it. EXCUSE ME?

215222,"How anyone could not like this movie is beyond me.  I hate to wax nostalgic, but it's very hard for me to believe it's been 23 years since this movie's release.  While I cringe at those 80's clothes and hairdos, I'm fully aware that the comedy here remains timeless and the angst of the wasteland known as high school remains equally pertinent.Although Matthew Broderick is more renowned these days for being Sarah Jessica Parker's husband and for his role in the Broadway version of Mel Brook's ""The Producers,"" I'll forever fondly remember him for his work as the cunning, school-cutting, school clown Bueller.  It sucks to typecast an actor, but it's pretty hard to beat his performance here.This movie is loaded with so many goodie quotes that an entire review can be composed solely on that subject.  It also features a few people who got noticed here and got bigger roles: Jennifer Grey one year before ""Dirty Dancing"" and Jeffrey Jones, as Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney, two years prior to ""Beetlejuice,"" to name but two of this great cast.  For me, it's always pleasantly shocking to see previously unknown actors and actresses in older movies and wonder how you could have glanced over them in the first place (even though you can never tell who's going to be famous).I can't help but watch this from beginning to end every time - and I don't mind a single second spent watching this - even if it's the one-thousandth and first time I've watched it.  To be cliche, it gets better and better each time.From Rooney getting his to Bueller's charmingly fooling everyone (except the sister) with his fake illness to the parking attendants riding Cameron's father's Ferrari at 100-plus mph and jacking up the miles to the stuffy atmosphere of the fancy downtown Chicago restaurant Bueller smooth talks his way into to the famous scene where the impromptu rendition of The Beatles' version of ""Twist and Shout"" livens up the downtown parade (complete with the zombie walk from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video from a segment of the crowd), ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" just screams classic from beginning to end.

467729,"The so-called ""nuclear family"" that America had come to idealize as a result of the post-WW II Baby Boom was eventually exposed as an illusion as a result of the many social upheavals of the 1960s, with many young kids either running away from home to hippie communes or finding solace in the potentially deadly world of drugs because parents either didn't understand, or even more didn't WANT to understand, their offspring.  Such was the focus of the above-average 1971 TV movie MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING, which did a rather good job of showing the downsides of both the counterculture and the typical American ""nuclear family.""Sally Field, in a role that broke away from her Gidget/Flying Nun persona of the past, stars as a runaway who returns home from a hippie lifestyle after a year in which she has been bruised and scorned by her hippie lover (David Carradine).  What she finds when she returns home is nothing short of depressing: her parents (Jackie Cooper; Eleanor Parker) still look upon her actions with scorn and disapproval, and yet they too indulge in their own brand of reckless behavior, using over-the-counter pills and alcohol instead of marijuana.  Most distressing of all is that Field's younger sister (Lane Bradbury) is headed down the same path as she once was, practically being forced down that path by the parents, who act with relentless hypocrisy, unwilling to understand why their offspring have rebelled the way they have.Though very emblematic of its time, with certain montage sequences and slightly psychedelic flashbacks, making it obviously dated in some ways, MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING avoids the fate of so many heavy-handed counterculture films by taking an ambivalent approach.  The counterculture doesn't exactly get a free pass here, especially given the fact that Carradine's character seems too eerily close to that of Charles Manson, seducing Field and then (tragically) Bradbury in the dark side of hippiedom.  Then again, neither does the ""nuclear family"" structure that Parker and Cooper represent; their ideals are so rigid, and their beliefs and their hypocrisy solidified to such an extent, that they don't see the harm their actions have on their daughters.Despite a few flaws, MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING is bolstered by a superb dramatic performance by Field, which presages her later roles in pieces like SYBIL and NORMA RAE, and two period-era acoustic folk-pop songs sung by Linda Ronstadt.  The film also boasts very sympathetic director from Joseph Sargent, best known for the 1970 science fiction drama COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT and the taut 1974 thriller THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE.  Even though it can't help avoid being dated in certain ways, MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING still stands as a very critical look at the things that broke so many families apart at the end of the 60s and the start of the 70s.",Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring VHS

I have never played the game but that shouldn't be the reason why it was unclear what the heck was going on. Mark Wahlberg played Max Payne so passionlessly that it ached to watch, he was flat and lifeless. I understand that in the film he went through trauma since his wife and kid were killed but did it kill his acting too? He wasn't the tough guy he was portraying, he was a zombie, not to mention the lame casting; Nelly Furtado ( short part but still) and Ludacris? Really, are there no actors left to do their craft? Mila Kunis got her twitchy eyes fixed but still looked like a pug in makeup, not to mention Olga Kurylenko who played Mona Sax's sister, literally wearing the same nightie she wore as a dress in her other movie ""Hitman"" I was appalled that she had to play the exact same character, her outfit and makeup was exact, and of course she had to act like a monkey in heat, once was enough but to see her do it twice in two movies where it was almost identical was maddening, grrrr!At first the story was intriguing, the secret that seemed to bind people and then cause them death looked cool, not to mention they all had wing tattoos on their wrists; the wing of a Valkyrie, the Norse mythological deity that took those who died a violent death to heavens....Pretty soon we get to see dark winged creatures ripping people to shreds, later we find out that perhaps its all a hallucination, well at the end I didn't know what it was and I watched the whole movie. The mystery sucks if all the ends are loose and the secret isn't so shocking, some parts were obvious and some weren't even surprising, just a poor choice of conclusion and overall I thought the movie had nothing to say, even the ending was hollow and unimpressive.

76121,"It's odd to like an original 1952  film and then like the re-make equally so, if not more, but that's the case with this film. I have viewed both versions of this film at least three times apiece and thoroughly enjoy both.As is sometimes the case with remakes, some of the twists and turns of this thriller were also changed from the first film. They didn't spoil it, though. I have no objection to the changes made here because the bottom line is entertainment, and that's where this movie excels. Plausible? No, but neither was the original, for that matter, and neither are a lot of suspense/ crime films.What makes this re-run good, in addition to the great suspense, are several other things: 1 - Gene Hackman, one of the best actors of his generation and often overlooked in discussions of great actors; 2 - nice photography featuring some great train shots and the scenic Canadian Rockies; 3 - an interesting assortment of characters, some of which keep you guessing whether they are the good guys or the bad guys; 4 - a dash of humor thrown in here and there to break the tension.In addition to Hackman, we see the sexy Anne Archer, who gives a nice film noir feel to the movie and we get some good supporting performances including two from guys with the same last name: J.T. and Emmet Walsh and one from a guy who plays one of the hit men: James Sikking. That's a name I'm not familiar with, but he has a scene talking to Hackman that is riveting.****possible spoilers**** The main fault of the movie at least to me, was the ""Rambo"" mentality in which I mean the villains have the good guy in point-blank, can't-miss range several times and....you guessed it: they miss.

1276495,"At long last!  Those of us who've followed Joan Baez' career (some since her beginning 50 years ago at the Newport Folk Festival) have watched her evolve into a legend in the folk music genre, an iconic figure with unparalleled skills as singer/songwriter, musician, and interpreter of some of the most beautiful and evocative folk, country, blues and rock songs ever written.  We've bought her albums, then her cassettes, then her cd's, but we've also watched, listened and read about her efforts on behalf of the most vulnerable, war torn, disenfranchised and persecuted throughout the world.Joan has stood with only her guitar and her clear, luminous voice braving dictators and bullies, military henchmen and bigoted thugs who would try to silence her from speaking or singing, determined to bring comfort and solace where she could, and hope and inspiration where she might.  She has sung, marched, written about and simply been present at some of the seminal events of the past century; she has seen the triumphs and tragedies close up.And finally this remarkable life has been documented with a depth befitting the woman who has quite rightfully become known as the Queen of Folk!  The PBS 'American Masters' film takes us inside Joan's family, provides unprecedented access to friends and colleagues, and reveals the influences for her activism and her music---all candidly intimate and not always flattering, but never less than fascinating and sometimes funny, often poignant and always enthralling.I would urge anyone who is familiar with and appreciates Ms. Baez' music to see this extraordinary documentary, and enjoy the splendid cd of her music that accompanies the DVD and traverses her career from its very beginnings to her most recent release, produced by Steve Earle.  It's been a long time coming, but it's here at last...THANK YOU, Joan Baez, PBS and the producers and filmmakers for this wonderful tribute!",N/A

Otherwise this tedious and silly 'thriller' is a tired unimaginative rehash of all of the previous movies about multiple personality disorders such as The Three Faces of Eve, Sybil, etc that are so superior to this story written by Juliette Sales and writer/director Agn&egrave;s Merlet.Apparently hoping to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, director Merlet places her story on an Island off Ireland populated with a  sick group of folks who protect the strange secrets of the title character Dorothy Mills (Jenn Murray). Needing to explore her own demons, a Dublin psychiatrist Dr Jane Van Dopp (van Houten) gains the assignment to explore the strange case of Mills and her history. In a series of flashbacks and inane reenactments of incidents, the truths behind the island's strange inhabitants, Dorothy Mills, and Dr Jane Van Doop come forward.

1226769,"I enjoyed this movie, although the decision to set it in 1960s Brooklyn created some doubts in my mind that I don't think the director intended.First, you have to get over the nuns' habits, which made me think at first that the movie was set among the Puritans of 1600s America. Then, you have to adjust to Meryl Streep's heavy Brooklyn accent, which is so over-the-top it's a hoot. Flickering lights and blowing leaves are also a heavy-handed device.Beyond that, you can settle in to enjoy a story that is full of intrigue, despite the lack of much onscreen action. Did the priest molest a boy or didn't he?Without printing any spoilers, I will say that I doubted that Meryl Streep's nun could have the power to bring down a Catholic priest of that era. Today, after the pedophile scandals, yes. In the 1960s, no. Also, if there is any doubt about the priest's guilt, why does he act the way he does? It didn't add up for me. Doubts of faith seemed plausible to me, doubts of other kinds didn't.Still, I much prefer this kind of movie, in which the inner lives of the protagonists are rich, and their motives mixed.

The message: kids - be honest and be trustworthy and don't be obnoxious; parents - don't spoil your kids or they'll quickly turn out to be brats.Wow, no wonder liberal film critics like Leonard Maltin trashed this film. It was not the normal message being delivered in movies, which usually mocks the good and glorifies the bad. That's what makes this story refreshing, and the same goes for the re-make that was released in 2005.Peter Ostrum plays the likable Charlie and is very good. He's one of the nicest kids ever put on screen and was a fine actor. It's kind of surprising this was the only film he ever did! Jack Albertson does a nice job of Charlie's loving grandpa and so do the bratty kids, especially the English girl who is so bad you have to laugh at her.

Mike's Mum Trish is effectively running the solid but uninspiring joint (a beautifully understated performance by MARGO MARTINDALE), while her says-little and does-even-less husband Jerry (FRED WARD at his effective best) seems stuck in a rut he doesn't know how to get out of.Life at the Motel is routine and boring - especially for the friendless and womanless Mike.

There's one particularly great scene where Sue figures if she lets Mike touch her perfectly formed posterior, he'll give up and she can get on with her presentation notes and get a night's sleep (title above). She leans over and presents the said rear for his delectation. With his hand placed on her right cheek, they talk about weather conditions in Maryland - it's both visually and lyrically - very, very funny.But what keeps you watching is the growing tenderness between the two. Mike may not be the smartest tool in the kit, but he is heartfelt and sincere - and in many ways despite her obvious intelligence and affluence, Sue isn't. She needs to learn that and he needs to grow up. Woody Harrelson also turns up in a great pantomime role as the ex-punk-rocker Jango who is now rich through dog handling. Later Mike's Mum Trish becomes gravely ill - thereby presenting the two men in her life with changes both may not want but need...and on it goes.Written and Directed by first-timer STEPHEN BELBER and produced by SIDNEY KEMMEL, the offbeat rom-com ""Management"" hit the US screens in May 2009 receiving excellent reviews. And on the strength of this September 2009 BLU RAY - it's easy to see why.I first spotted Steve Zahn in a wonderful film called ""Happy, Texas"" where he was paired up with Britain's Jeremy Northam as two escaped convicts trapped in a hick town which tames their thieving ways and changes both of them for the better. Zahn's been bubbling under for years, but in ""Management"" he really shines. A lesser actor might have overdone the inner nerd to go for hammy laughs - and in the real world his character's ludicrous naivety might even have been insufferable, but Zahn makes you ache for Mike's attempts at wooing Susan.Aniston is more capable now as an actress than she's ever been. Her character's disbelief and dismissive awkwardness at first is so believable - and as the movie progresses - her barriers very subtly start coming down - to a point where you really do believe she would look at Mike as a 'nice guy' - and as 'good for her' - and that's more important than all the material crap in-between. She is superb in the part.Although it feels like an Indie production, the BLU RAY image is beautiful throughout - really crisp - you are aware almost all of the time that this is high-def and not a soft DVD image.The extras are great fun too; a feature-length commentary by Stephen Belber and Steve Zahn, Gag Reels and Bloopers (very funny outtakes - mostly of the whole cast giggling and fluffing lines), several Deleted Scenes and a Trailer.""Management"" is not going to bolster up my gravity-bound man-titties or lessen the amount of hair growing out my nasal passages - but it has enriched my brain. At its core is a truly lovely premise - that love will out - and corny or not - that 'is' what many of us believe.""Management"" isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but you can't help but think that the world is a nicer place, because this sweet little ode to hope is in it.A nice little movie...",N/A
417178,"I went into this knowing very little about the movie aside from other viewers comments.  I didn't have high expectations due to the time period that it was shot in as well the fact that Troma was releasing it.I have never been a Troma fan.  So for those of you that are in the same camp - you are safe with this in regards to this being Tromaesque.Gore hounds steer clear as there really is none in this.I will start off with the one negative note which is based on my personal opinion.  The music at times was 8-bit video game fluff which I found distracting at times.  But for the most part the synth score remained ominous and droning.Combat Shock is cold, gritty and depressing.  The no budget adds to the realism as they worked with everything they could muster up.  The cries of the baby are still ringing in my ears.Just like Kids was important viewing for the 90's, Combat Shock tells a tale of Urban slums in the 80's through out America.  It still bears relevance today.If you want a movie that will make you pause and think of where we were, where we are and whats ahead without glitz and glammer, this is a dark trip that will leave you feeling empty yet somewhat satisfied.  Not for all tastes but kudos to all involved in making an important film relevant again that otherwise would have been locked away.",Combat Shock VHS

1215017,"I laughed like a drain at this one, mind you, I had consumed a few tins of the old liquid laughter before I started, which obviously oiled the wheels a bit, but none the less, there was plenty of laugh out loud stuff in it, ok, its coarse and naughty, could have been naughtier, I was a little annoyed on behalf of the supporting cast that when the eponymous Zack and Miri got down to the action, the pair of them were wearing more clothes than I would go down to the shops in.Which is a drawback of both porn and real life love, one does not generally want to be watching or participating in loveular action when the other person is wearing (in Miris case) her bra, denim shorts, an overcoat and a sensible hat. The fat lad didnt even get his shirt off. Poor quality ""grumble"" that is.Still, yer man from Jay and Silent Bob was hilarious as ever, you get the feeling that they all had a brilliant laugh filming it, and it must have been hard to keep a straight face, or indeed even the other way around.

263658,"Short Circuit is in many ways superior to Short Circuit II.  Short Circuit II is still an excellent story.  What we have here is the perennial (new movie every year with the same theme) affirmation of the sanctity of life movie.  These two movies feature the coming of age for the robot Johnny-Five.  The first movie deals with his awakening and struggle for a place in the human-society where he finds himself.  He must battle the forces deployed by his creator-corporation to return him to the spare parts bin.  It's a nail-biter.  In the second feature he plays out a parody of Pinochio's Troubled Years as he labors in an abandoned warehouse to help ""Ben"" by day even as the bad-guys are trying to corrupt him to steal a fortune in diamonds by night.  A robot never really sleeps.  There are numerous corruptions for the young would-be citizen Johnny-Five to struggle with.  As we cut to the chase again there is a flight-to-the-death struggle as Johnny-Five hangs by a thread (a crane-cable) losing power to the strains of ""Where have all the good men gone ? ...

1167243,"I am undeniably a child of the eighties, growing up going to theaters to watch movies like ""Jurassic Park"", ""Stargate"", ""Deep Impact"" and ""Independence Day."" But one particular sci-fi film stands out.  I went in 1991 to see ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" with my dad and older brother and being only 10 felt like a BIG GUY; going to see an ""R"" rated film in the Theaters with my male family members.  The thing was that the film scared the ever living snot out of me! It also intrigued me, and captivated me and surprised me and had me cheering and sitting on the edge of my seat.  So, dad took me home and showed me the first one; which scared me even more and yet I was captivated by the whole aspect of these machines who looked SO incredibly like US! And the struggle that WE went through against them and also with them.  I always thought it would make a FANTASTIC t.v. show! But all I got in the subsequent years following ""T2"" was ""T3: Rise of the Machines"", which had a fantastic female teminator, a fantastic ending, but a horrendous premise and first 2/3's!  So, when I heard about ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", I was 100% along for the ride from day one...I was only scared of one thing, that the show would follow ""T3"", but after hearing who they hired for John and that it was set shortly after ""T2"" my fears were gone.  Then just to seal the deal, I heard that Summer ""Wow"" Glau, my favorite TV hottie was cast as the new Terminator, I was pumped. Needless to say, Season One did not disappoint.I felt that the show was a strong breath of fresh air, instead of what many thought it would be; ""Terminator of the week chase and escape"", we got a well thought out intensely character driven show, that made you use your brain.  Yep, I said it.  In a world of ""American Idol"", ""Ugly Betty"", ""Desperate Housewives"", and about 10,000 reality shows there are very few shows with a brain.  ""CSI"", ""Fringe"" and ""Lost"" being two rare exceptions.In what started out as a chase show, smartly steered away as John, Sarah and Cameron (Thomas Dekker, Lena Headey and Summer Glau respectively) decided to find away to shut it down, and that lead to them:- Going to the future/present- Creating a few well thought out time paradox's- Getting the FBI on their tale- Causing a few innocent deathsand a few other choice incidents, but just like on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" choices had consequences, even choices like going to pick up a birthday cake.Picking up said cake is where we leave the crew at the end of season one, Derek Reese; Kyle Reese (John's father)is introduced near the end of season one and brings a fantastic dynamic, spreading a small seed of untrust between John and Cameron.  Cameron gets into their SUV and BOMB! See you next season.The seeds laid in season one are just the ground work for what would have become an ICONIC show if Fox had given ""T:TSCC"" the time to grow.  What we see in Season Two are the first blooms of the tree that is planted.  Regular and trusted characters aren't always meant to be trusted. Damage can't always be fixed; figuratively or physically. Being the good guys is in the eye of the beholder, and many other things are looked at in this season.The main focus is on John's loosing trust in his mother, then his loosing trust in Cameron and finally realizing that he must stop hiding behind others and take the forefront.  We follow Cameron on an arc of self discovery, can she really love John or is it all a programmed lie, and who was the woman that she was modeled after?  We see where Dereks intense distrust of Cameron comes from, and find out a few secrets of his own. And what of Ellison? Is he good, bad, neither?We're introduced to some Fantastic new characters.  Lead singer of Garbage; Shirley Manson takes on the role of Katherine Weaver a CEO of a powerful computer industry who holds a big secret of her own.  Stephanie Jacobsen is sexy and misunderstood as Jesse who's story, because of the show's cancellation, will never be fully explained, wash she good or bad? What's here ""REAL"" fate? Levin Rambin is fantastic as Riley, Johns new love interest who; as with everyone else has her own agenda and secrets to keep.The action of season two was amped up, as were the effects, due to the addition of a T-1000 to the cast, and the Connor gangs attempts at finding pieces to the puzzle of what is happening; we have many great new effects.  The look of the new HK (Hunter Killer) that plays a large role in the middle and end of the season; looks just as good as it's big screen counterparts.  The T-1000's morphing scenes and action scenes are fantastic as well.Josh Freidman is such a fantastic story craftsman, he knows how shows usually play it and he goes the opposite way half the time and then when we expect him to do one thing, out of the clear blue, something else.  Watch the episode ""Adam Raised A Cain"" and ""Today is the Day Parts I and II"". No one is safe in this world, and death even the deaths of our lead cast are not forbidden. In fact, they start to drop like flies in the final four episodes, leading to what I consider to be one of the best season/series finales of all time. It's just a shame the show was cancelled, what was given to us in season two was magnificent.  Maybe somehow in the near future, we as fans will get a third season, maybe on another channel or online, who knows.  ""The future isn't set"".",N/A
707021,"BBC TV drama series is noted as faithful adaptation of the novel though the special effects particularly animation were not well organized. It's sometimes painful to see the stuffed human actors which might be a letdown even for the eyes of the children. But the episodes of ""Voyage of Dawn Trader"" and ""Silver Chair"" are well produced and are thrilling. Silver Chair in particular, the quest lies more in the characters mindset and challenging even for readers and viewers.1 The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeThere aren't so much striking difference between this TV version and recent film version. TV series may seem poor in the use of animation and special effects. Just be patient and view it to remember what the story was like before getting into the later episodes.2 Price Caspian: TV version may seem too brief compared to the film one. But in this series Caspian is a boy about the age of Susan, Peter, Edmund and Lucy. I still don't see why the movie version changed the setting as an adult Prince.3 The Voyage of Dawn TreaderThat's very imteresting story, full of adventures visitng various unique islands. I cannot wait to see the coming 20 century fox version due around next year.4 Silver ChairIt's another of great adventure story. The lead role for this story seems to be Jill Pole, performed by Camilla Power, now one of the major British Actresses. If Century Fox pursue the film adaptation who will play the role of Jill Pole may be the key. The Ending part reminds me of 1984 film version of Neverending Story.Even the BBC series could not cover THE LAST BATTLE the last of the Narnia series because it would be too difficult to show it on the film at that time. Now techonological deadlock might be eased but I doubt the film will see the light of day.Verdict: Faithful AdaptationRating: 85 out of 100Recommended for: Narnia fans young and old.",The Chronicles of Narnia: (House of Wax 1953 / The Haunting 1963 / Freaks / Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1941)
1148011,"This movie is about a female friend helping a pregnant girl friend as they slowly live through one day of the realities of getting an illegal abortion from a black market non-medically-trained man in 1987 Romania.This movie's screenplay was written incredibly well.  Rarely are characters drawn with such individualized, understated, and credible dialogue.  The setting of communist-crumbled Romania is fully accomplished from the start.  Concise scenes are fluidly connected together with continuous, yet not labored, camera shots.  The casting is superb - I found all the characters to be incredibly believable and engrossing.  I also thought the acting was compelling and flawless.So that you don't think I'm a ""I like everything"" critic - I found the frequent use of handheld camera shots (instead of tripoded) to be unnecessarily distracting, and I didn't think it added any particularly positive or stylistic ambiance.  If it was done primarily because of budget restraints, I can fully respect the choice, but otherwise I would have taken the distracting ""person holding the camera"" out of the regular viewing equation.This movie is incredibly difficult to watch, whether you are a woman or a man.  But everyone should strongly consider watching it, especially men - to understand more of the horrific realities women must face in these circumstances.While watching this film on dvd, I could not handle the stress continuously, so I took regular breaks to compile my thoughts and calm my senses.Spoiler alert:At one point in the film, the man willing to perform the abortion requests more money for his services than the women have.  Faced with the option of not being able to get an abortion, the non-pregnant friend and the pregnant woman both silently and implicitly agree to have sex with the man (separately and individually) to ""pay"" the difference in payment before he performs the abortion.  The conscientous filmmakers intentionally do not show the sex-for-payment scenes, but clearly imply the sex scenes off-camera, showing each woman sitting outside the room as the other woman has sex with the man, then showing each woman walk quickly to the bathroom immediately after - to wash themselves in an attempt to mitigate the effects of what they have each just done.~ end of spoiler ~The settings, hair & make-up, and clothing are fitting for the subject matter and never distracting to the important stories being told.This film is Not Rated, but if it had received a rating for broad release in the U.S., it would likely have received an NC-17 rating.  It is an example of an excellent ""NC-17"" film.Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars.  The film won the 2007 Cannes Film Festivalfs highest honor, the Palme d'Or.  The film was The New York Times' Film Critic's, Steven Holden's, top film on his list of Top Ten films for 2008.This film is a story that most of us can watch with some sense of detachment - we sit in a dark room and watch horrific things happen to other people.  It's important to remember that for many women in many parts of the world, these kinds of circumstances still exist (or worse), and their memories are not vicarious.  These kinds of memories they must live and deal with for the rest of their lives.May you never live in a country where you are put into Gabita's circumstances.  May you never ask a friend to do what Gabita asks her friend Otilia to do for her.  May you never live in a country that forces women to choose from the untenable choices Gabita and her friend Otilia have available to them.  But know there are many women who, out of love and caring, have done all the things Otilia did for her girl friend Gabita, and would do them again for their girl friends if laws did not allow for medically licensed abortions.  It's everyone's responsibility to make sure laws, in each of our countries, do not force women into these kinds of choices.","4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"

85031,"The reaction to this film since its release is the finest illustration of why the motion picture is probably doomed as an art form. No Country is probably the BEST FILM OF THIS DECADE. This is about film-making as a craft, practiced by people who know what they are doing and have an agenda involving something other than making a ton of money. Yet around the time of its triumph at the Oscars, you could sense the indifference emanating from the mainstream press and moviegoers. This was a film utterly lacking in glamour or over-the-top special effects. It left them cold. I can hear them now: ""Why should we let a bunch of snooty film critics tell us what a good movie is?""For these people, I have no sympathy. Because the fact is, they have nothing to worry about. It is they who the film industry is listening to, not us snobs. And because of this, films of No Country's artistic caliber will soon become extinct. Soon, every time someone pitches the studios a project like No Country they're gonna say, ""Nobody wants to see that."" And for the most part, they're right. Us film snobs are totally outnumbered. And all of us snobs must now come to grips with the plain truth: that people like Orson Wells, Alfred Hitchcock, Francis Copolla, Martin Scorcese, David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson and the Coen Brothers have labored, sweated and fought for this art form for the last seventy years and made it into a thing of beauty just so the greater majority of America could chuck all that out the window for the sake of Fast and Furious and ""reality"" shows. Nice going.But years from now, I will still be clinging to my carefully preserved copy of this fine edition to help me remember Tommy Lee Jones' wonderful performance, the stark beauty of the cinematography, the subtle audio treatments in the hotel scene with the barely audible unscrewing of the hallway lightbulb, the sparse but clever and unusual dialogue, and the overall exacting attention to detail that distinguishes a film like this from 98 percent of what has been turning up in theaters during this decade. As for the violence, please. I mean, come on, you can see arguably as many gross-outs on CSI every week.So if you are someone who misses what Hollywood once was and wishes that the studios would not abandon cinema as an art, this one is for you. Yes, it is the Coen's best since Fargo, and I can't think of a better film in this decade except for possibly Mulholland Drive. And if you are someone who just spent $11 to see Fast and Furious or something along those lines and were actually entertained, then skip this and leave us snobs to our memories.",N/A

1164283,"There are times when movies can blow you away.  The first Transformers movie certainly blew me away.  Despite its problems, it was a fun ride with a well crafted story and even some well crafted dialog and sequence of events.  Transformers Revenge of the Fallen, however, shows us that bigger isn't always better.  In fact, bigger can be a headache.  Especially when it's a Michael Bay sequel.The film brings back Shia Lebouf and Megan Fox as our protagonists.  As it turns out, the Transformers actually came to earth a lot sooner than we thought.  In the year 17,000 BC to be exact.  A war happened involving some of the machines.  As it turns out, the Fallen were sealed... but they may soon rise again.  And Sam (played by Shia) has the key to this, which the Decepticons want to get a hold of.  And quickly.Anyway, Sam is off to college and as far as he is concerned, Bumblebee's job is done.  His parents are rather emotional over seeing him go (particularly his mother), but things could be worse, right?  Well, as it turns out, when he gets to college he meets a strange guy who has been tracking these ""aliens"" for some time, ever since the incident happened two years ago.  Apparently the Government is so good at covering things up they were able to make sure no one could remember all the chaos that happened right in the middle of the streets of the first film... in broad daylight.  Even stranger is that Sam still has a piece of the cube (All Spark) and despite holding onto it for two years, only now manages to touch it.  When he does, however, he begins to see a bunch of symbols in his head that he doesn't know anything about.These symbols, however, play  much bigger role than he could imagine.  The Fallen, it turns out, will rise again sometime.  And only one Autobot can stop them... Optimus Prime.  Unfortunately through circumstances it's a wonder if he can.  Even worse is how more decepticons are coming forth and finding most f the good guys.  Not to mention there's another man in the government hoping to mess things up because they believe that it's the fault of the Autobots that the Decepticons are coming in the first place.  And Michael Bay makes sure you really don't like this guy.Meanwhile, the Decepticons are after Sam because he knows something that's been implanted into his brain.  The end result is that the Autobots along with Sam and Mikeala--and a few supporting characters--have to stop the Fallen from rising again.On paper it sounds rather simple, but the movie is a lot more convoluted than it actually sounds.  It not so much that the plot makes little sense as it is that it keeps throwing one thing after another into the mix.  By the time the movie concludes you might find yourself having a little too much information.  But more than that, there's a lot of time spent away from the plot.  The first movie, for the most part, had very appropriate jokes that came at just the right moments.  Revenge of the Fallen throws several jokes at a wall hoping something will stick.  You'll get a good share of laughs, but also a lot of jokes that fall flat in the process.However, it's mostly Michael Bay's filming technique that makes the movie something of a drag.  In many instances the camera angles are incredibly weird and shaky.  When the robots are fighting it's really hard to get into the fight scenes because they're so chaotic and because the camera is constantly jerking around.  More often than not, you lose focus in the middle of the battle.  There are also tons of new robots introduced.  Good and bad.  Unfortunately the movie doesn't give us enough time to get to know any of them.  So much so that in some fights it was hard to tell the good guys from the bad.  Which brings up another thing, the fights themselves can be spectacular, but on the whole they're a little long.  Many moments in the movie are too overdone for their own good.The story in and of itself comes together but the way it comes together might leave some movie goers feeling cheated in some ways.  If anyone here has ever heard of the term ""Deus Ex Machina"" (which means ""God from the Machine"") then you should know that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is full of them.  In nearly impossible situations, amusing coincidences come into play.  Sam and friends need to get to Egypt upon JUST discovering they need to go there... they magically get there.  They find an old Transformer who is a Decepticon who just happens to have switched sides.  One of the most heart pounding moments of the entire movie is ruined by a Deus Ex Machina that looks as though Michael Bay and company decided to just tack it on.  There's plot and story but a lot of it comes off as an after thought.  Most of i just felt like things they tacked on to make sure that things come out just fine for our protagonists involved.  Every heart pounding moment is immediately crushed when you realize that no matter what happens, none of the characters are in any real danger because of many ""amusing coincidences.""  It makes the movie come as more predictable.That's not to say it isn't fun.  When you're not being given a headache by the camera work, the special effects are spectacular, and some of the fights are really good.  It's just that its hard to enjoy them because of the awkward camera movements and shifts.  Even Paul Greengras knew when we needed a break.That's not all, the movie is incredibly long.  Around two and half hours.  But it doesn't quite pass the butt-shifting contest.  A lot of scenes are long and drawn out.  The final battle in and of itself can make you feel like you're sitting through the incredibly long ending of Lord of the Rings.  It's not that it's long which can grate on the nerves so much as it is that Bay and his crew stuffed way too much in a movie.  Suffice to say, how long was this movie supposed to be before it was cut down?  There are so many characters and plot devices introduced that it's a wonder it could all e contained in one film.The acting, for the most part, isn't really all that bad, but there's far too much acting to care.  This is all about Shia.  Megan Fox is there, but she serves no real purpose other than to give the boys something to stare at between action sequences.One thing that might raise a few eyebrows however, may be ""The Twins.""  Where would Michael Bay be without ethnic stereotypes?  Here, the Twins are so stereotypical you wonder if Bay was trying to be offensive or funny.  I'm guessing it was the latter option of the two, but the crew on Transformers 2 did go a little overboard with it.Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is a visual spectacle but not much else beyond that.  To put it all in context, it's not hard to understand, but it's definitely cluttered.  And the director does nothing to make sure we care about the characters.  We don't learn much more about them than what the first movie gave us.  There's hardly any development.  It's pleasing to the eye, but little beyond that.",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

The groom-to-be disappears.  The rest of the movie is spent following the remaining three guys around Vegas while they try to figure out what happened.  Lots of slapstick comedy, lots of F*bombs, lots of guys mooning each other, one [...] shot of a stripper (Heather Graham)getting set to breast feed the baby that's in the movie poster, and then some final still photos at the end of one of the guys getting [...] from a really ugly woman.And oh, this isn't a Three Men and a Baby tale - the baby was only a very temporary prop for a couple of slapstick gags and that one gratuitous breastfeeding scene.  Then it mercifully disappeared from the story.Hardly a family-friendly movie, needless to say.What dreck.  What an utter waste of 100 minutes of life.

The promotional photo/poster and the movie trailers did strongly imply a ""Three Men and a Baby"" sort of family-oriented, if R-rated, comedy movie (definitely some false advertising there).  So it was a bit of a shock to see that photo at the end of the movie of the ugly woman fellating Zach Galifianakis.  I was sitting next to my two teenagers at the time and they were shocked.  I have no qualms about letting my kids watch R-rated movies, and have for many years.  In the past, depictions of [...] automatically got a film a minimum of an NC-17 rating.  I do not take my kids to NC-17 rated films, or to [...] flicks.  How this movie escaped an NC-17 rating is a question for the MPAA.  Nobody ever watches NC-17 rated movies anymore (too much free porn kicking around I guess), and so obviously the producers of this movie must have greased somebody's palms to escape this rating.Second, I wasn't sure when I first wrote this review that there was such a thing as a ""stupid guy flick"". I kind of threw that term out there as a test.  So thanks everybody for leaving all of your comments!  You passed this test with flying colors!  Now I know for sure there is such a thing as a ""stupid guy flick""!Addendum 2:  Hmmm... did some more research to try to understand the obsessive, semi-psychotic fandom for this movie, which is beginning to surpass ""Trekkie"" geek levels.  Here's a few facts:It was recently reported that 40% of households in America now have a female in the household (""the breadwinner"") who earns as much or more than anybody else in the household.  For a number of years now, far more females have attended 4-year college than males - statistically females outnumber males by 2-to-1 in many universities.  Several years ago, females began to outnumber the number of males entering medical school.No, Toto, we are not in Kansas anymore, back in the days when men were men, women were women, etc.  Something has definitely happened to the males of America, turned  them from the responsible heads of households and father figures of olde, into... the sort of men depicted in this movie!So, everybody, keep on posting those comments!  Your love for this ""stupid guy movie"" is phenomenal.  Without a doubt, this movie has hit upon a great truth as to what is happening in our country...",The Hangover - UNRATED
1258071,"I got a chance to watch this on ESPN and had high hopes that it would be very good. Not exactly what I was expecting. Basically you get Kobe with a hidden mic during a game and as the game (between L.A. and Spurs) goes on Kobe is watching the game and commenting on what he was thinking at that very moment.  It's like watching a dvd with commentary option set to on. The game itself was boring as you sit there watching and thinking, ""wow...is this going to get good?"" I think of highlights from Jordan days and his films being like, ""wow.....that was amazing...."" Kobe has plenty of highlights they could have mixed in or at least on a bonus disc but this was as bland as a popcorn rice cake.The nice part in the documentary is getting on the inside. Getting in the locker room and seeing what goes on was nice.  The whole idea is good but it really just wasn't interesting. Kobe fumbled alot when in the game and the film crew was trying very hard to capture this awesome moment and.......just didn't get it. The only nice parts in the movie where when they showed his family and his daughters at the end. Very touching but in terms of  ""execution"" of the film and basketball? Not entertaining. I rate it three stars just because I'm a Kobe fan. Just was expecting more from Spike on this one. It was okay to watch once....but that's about it.  Nothing to go running to your friends to strongly suggest. Nice to see good team play but it looked like a bad game for Kobe overall on the film.Now if Spike could have only captured the game against Toronto where Kobe dropped 81 points.  That would have been great to see. I'd rather watch that game in it's full length than watch this movie again.",Kobe Doin' Work: A Spike Lee Joint
375270,"He tells a joke about Tessio asking Tom Hagen for a pass (from the movie, The Godfather) and Tom nodding no. Now, i don't want to break the joke to you if not heard, but trust me its unbelievably hilarious, now each time when i see the Godfather, especially during that scene between Tessio and Tom, whilst everyone has a sombre expression on their faces in the room, i am the only laughing my head off thinking about Richard's joke.I would have to agree with an earlier reviewer that its not as funny as Live in Concert, but make no mistake, the momentum is definitely there. He handles his freebasing incident in a very humorous but in a redeemed manner.The consistency of jokes in this performance is extremely good and unlike Here and Now (in which the audience members are rude and boorish), this is a nice crowd and a very receptive audience, (known faces include a very young Jesse Jackson in the audience).He does Mudbone and his jokes about his trip to Africa and the epiphany he has there and his decision never to use the N word again, truly shows how much he has evolved as a performer and as a human being. He truly shows you his real self when he performs and that for me rates Richard Pryor as an honest comedian, with a big heart.",Live on the Sunset Strip VHS

75285,"This first adaptation of the Marvel Character is not exactly a masterpiece...but it's not a wreck either. Dolph Lungdren was not a bad choice at all to play this part, just the direction they creators took wasn't the best to take. Let me start by mentioning that The Punisher here does not wear the famous skull on his shirt; it is the most important piece on a character like this. It would be like having superman without the ""S"" or batman with out the bat on his chest. Also, The Punisher here does not care about wearing armor...I mean come'on, what's the harm in wearing it? Anyways there are countless mistakes here. Like the number of kids Frank Castle has is wrong, how they were murdered is also incorrect.The plot for those unfamiliar is quite simple and straight forward. Frank Castle (Dolph Lungdren) is an ex cop turned vigilante, who will stop at nothing to kill the corrupt. It a simple story that has been seen countless times. But the adaptation here is...not the worst, but not exactly the best either. The action is neat, the story is ok, but there's just so many inconsistencies and cheesy dialogue that bring the film low.If you are a fan of the comic, buy it, if not than just skip it. Keep also in mind that this movie was made in the late 80's, meaning that it's one of the earlier adaptations of Marvel. The best adaptation to date is the 2004 movie with Thomas Jane.

987379,"I laughed repeatedly throughout this movie. I love the classic Sellers movies and worried about how true to the original this would be.Honestly, I think this movie is an improvement over the original series. Steve Martin plays the physical comedy perfectly. The plot kept me engaged from beginning to end. None of the characters felt forced at all. I absolutely believed that every actor truly was the character that they were playing. Lastly, (or rather, firstly) the epic intro is one of the most stunning movie introductions I have ever watched.An interesting thought experiment is to think about the intro in the context of another movie. With slight modification it would have played just as beautifully in front of a modern Perry Mason murder mystery movie. I can't put my finger on what it is, but there is genius in that introduction.There are a few deleted scenes which are very very funny. If this movie has been named Airplane 3 then the airplane sequence would have been comedy gold. Sadly, it didn't find a place in this movie, but I loved it and actually watch that deleted scene every time I rewatch the movie simply because it's so wonderfully comedic.",N/A

They did a great job though.  It is an awesome satire.  If you are a fan of Star Wars you will love this.

958972,"While I applaud the studio for releasing this wonderful Irwin Allen film from the fate of dark obscurity too many films from the golden age suffer, they should strive for the best rendition possible. In this case 'Five Weeks' was filmed in CinemaScope - widescreen. This pan-n-scan dvd does not do this fun flick justice. [Update: The most current version of this dvd, as of August 2012, is now presented in it's proper widescreen format. *See Comments section.]One of the least known Jules Verne-inspired films and likely one of the few that can be specifically classified as a comedy.Tells the story of trailblazing inventor Professor Angus Fergusson, played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke, who develops a revolutionary aerostatic balloon. But unlike traditional balloons, which simply funnels heated air from its source, his method utilizes mechanically assisted avionics which allows extremely rapid ascents and descents while adding pitch and yaw. Unfortunately, 'The Jupiter' is mocked by the press and he himself is labeled a madman for his ""imbecilic contraption""; more likely to kill himself and anyone foolish enough to ride with him.His anger is only mollified when a wealthy American newspaper publisher steps in to fill the depleted financial coffers in his attempt to map the unexplored African continent.The newspaperman wants two things for that fiscal support. First, exclusive rights to print the adventures of flying into the unknown. And second, the professor must take along his nephew on the journey. Portraying goofy Donald O'Shay, Red Buttons is the Paris Hilton of his day, and his wealthy uncle can no longer tolerate the public humiliation. He'll pay anything to get his troublesome kin away from the press, out of the public limelight, and cutoff from proper society. Even fund an expedition into uncharted lands.Unbeknownst to all, the professor is quietly invited to a private meeting with the Prime Minister. A meeting that is actually at the secret behest of The Crown itself, Queen Victoria, and her plan to prevent a terrible tragedy.Slave traders are inbound toward the same unexplored African lands - and should they be the first to plant their flag, will have international rights to begin taking innocents into their sick perverted trade. Her Majesty has rightly deemed it evil and has tasked Professor Fergusson to be her unofficial envoy to stop it. Britain must get there first.However, the government cannot openly condone such an adventure without risking considerable political damage. So Fergusson is asked to take on the mission without official sanction. Should things go awry, he will be left alone to suffer whatever fate befalls him. Will he accept such a dangerous mission?As if there were any question.So begins a humorous lighthearted adventure as the group, which will eventually include an escaped slave and her would-be slave captor, a rescued American missionary, 60's pop songster Fabian, and a clever chimpanzee.Personal Notes:- Sir Cedric could be an amazing dramatist - i.e.The Ten Commandments. But that deep sonorous baritone did not cover sometimes questionable performances, this film being an excellent case in point. Personally never found his work outside of drama particularly convincing.- Have always enjoyed the incredible Red Buttons in whatever he project he undertook. The man was just so entertaining, but particularly during this period of his career.- Barbara Eden is, for me, one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced the screen. Period.",N/A

The dance is somewhat awkward but it has a primitive quality that, for me, brings out the sensuality.Kim Novak was absolutely beautiful and, with her curvy body, looked every inch the woman.

1177666,"This rudely rambunctious, intermittently funny 2008 holiday comedy is a supreme case of Hollywood overkill along the lines of Jay Roach'sMeet the Fockers. Running a scant 89 minutes, it stars no less than five Oscar-winning actors in the standard cookie-cutter story of a commitment-phobic couple who are forced to visit each of their four divorced parents on Christmas day. Co-written by first-timers Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson, along with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who co-wroteThe Hangover), the premise shows promise with Kate and Brad, a pair of self-satisfied, upwardly mobile San Franciscans meeting for what looks like the first time in a bar. Their sharp-tongued banter turns out to be a role-playing fantasy since they are three years into their comfortable relationship. A major fog blanket over the city ruins their plans for a holiday vacation in Fiji. What's worse is that they are caught by a local news camera at the airport. Because they deceived their families into thinking they were traveling overseas to help starving third-world children, they embark on a daylong journey to each of their parent's houses, all conveniently located in the Bay Area.However, the movie starts to decline precipitously with each visit. The first home the couple drops by belongs to Brad's redneck father, where his other sons, cage-fighting brothers Denver and Dallas tackle Brad with painful wrestling moves. It ends with an uncomfortable gift exchange where Brad's expensive gifts humiliate his blue-collar family. The couple then visits Kate's overly affectionate mother and a den of cougars, an episode in which it is revealed Kate had a childhood weight problem and a possible lesbian past. Brad's therapist mother is next on the itinerary, but he's still angry that she married his best friend, who is half her age, and a game of Taboo reveals the communication gulf that really exists between Kate and Brad. The last stop is at the home of Kate's father, and this is where the tone gets serious-minded as the couple learns a lesson in the value of being with family in spite of whatever personal differences may exist to divide them the rest of the year.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon - he with his semi-improvised riffing, she with her exacting intelligence - would seem to be absurdly mismatched, but they spar convincingly, even if they do look more like best friends than lovers. Vaughn gets to shine in a Christmas pageant scene where he basks in the limelight of his ham-fisted stage debut. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight play the parents with little screen time, and only Duvall leaves much of an impression as an embittered shell of a man. Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Carol Kane, and Kristin Chenoweth gamely play various relatives in equally smallish roles. The whole venture is directed by Seth Gordon, whose only previous feature-length credit is the critically praised video-game documentary,The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, and his storytelling inexperience shows in the sometimes ADD-level pacing of the story.

In TOM THUMB (1958), the special-effects wizardry of George Pal, the outstanding talents of Russ Tamblyn, and the whimsical music of Peggy Lee come together to create a spellbinding story for the young and the young in heart.A childless couple (Bernard Miles and Jessie Matthews) are blessed with a tiny, thumb-sized son, when they are given three wishes by the beautiful and kindly Forest Queen (June Thorburn).  Little Tom Thumb (Russ Tamblyn) turns out to be quite a handful indeed, leading the whole town on a merry dance in his enchanted shoes; but later falls into the clutches of two merciless crooks (Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers), who exploit Tom by making him participate in a robbery, for which his parents are ultimately blamed.  Tom and his friend Woody (Alan Young) - who also hides a yen for the lovely Forest Queen - must race against time to catch the real villains, and save Tom's parents in the process.A real charmer.  TOM THUMB springs to life with music, colour and merriment to spare.  Russ Tamblyn is a little dynamo in the title role, displaying his amazing gymnast skills in some fantastic dance numbers (""tom thumb's Tune"", ""Talented Shoes"").  George Pal's legendary stop-motion Puppetoons make several appearances (who could ever forget the Yawning Man?), and the strong chemistry of June Thorburn and Alan Young helps the romantic portion of the story become one of it's most memorable components.The DVD includes both widescreen and full-frame versions of the movie, plus the trailer.",Tom Thumb

The movie moves back and forth between Alice's childhood and old age, as she remembers the past, but then it also moves into fantasies which feature the creations from Jim Henson.

Maybe it's caused by the British director's effort not to merge with Hollywood cliches, but the film somehow fails to click on emotional level. We see the Wheeler couple's marriage falling apart - Kate Winslet in phenomenally difficult, but rather unsympathetic role and Leo DiCaprio, very naturally playing a guy who tries hard but his everyman character is just not good enough for his wife. Stuck in the 1950's, their lives are unsatisfying, going to Paris seems as the only way out. Ironically - and most similarly to ""American Beauty"" - the only person who sees through the Wheeler facade is the man confined to mental institution (Michael Shannon in a revelation role). The potential of Richard Yates' praised novel is widely said to be filmed not so fully as it should have been - maybe the film's characters are too bookish to ring true.The bottom line for many: Is the Wheeler life really so empty?

Agnes Bruckner, Trevor Wright and Arjay Smithplay are the hapless travelers from a big city, who choose the wrong place to rest for the night.About 10 or 15 minutes in, ""Vacancy 2: The First Cut"" shows us what kind of ""business"" the motel owner Gordon (David Moscow) and his partner are really engaged in. This deprives the film of urban legend-like mystery and suspense considerably, though there are still a few twists and turns in the storyline.All in all the film is watchable with nice photography and production designs.

There was a lot left unexplained and why go for a realistic approach just to blow the end end of the movie with such fictional bulldust?However, least this time the films maker didn't try to con you into believing the story was true just to sell a low budget movie, least he had a budget for this one to hire an entire film crew to make a proper movie..... it just needed a much better ending imo.",Believers
444382,"I first saw this late night on TV when it was called ""Mohammed: Messenger of God"". I was impressed that the start of the film shows that it's been given the seal of approval of authorities in Egypt.I was impressed by the fact that no actor actually plays 'the prophet'. People talk to the camera - as if the camera itself is him.I was drawn to Islam by its simple and direct message. However I was disappointed by the highly selective dealings with his life. His child-bride Aisha is not shown at all.Some of the battles are shown, as he fights to regain entry to Mecca. The subsequent murder of political opposition, and the massacre of hundreds of Banu Qurayza prisoners in cold-blood are excluded from this narrative.If you want a film that completely ignores controversy about the founder of Islam, this is an ideal film.",The Message VHS

I went through the entire 3-DVD set in 5-nights, and thoroughly enjoyed each episode in the miniseries.

1154750,"Volume Four of ""The Colour Honeymooners"" is a dan-dan-dandy of a closing for the series.All final twelve eps are here from Set.27/69 to Feb.28/70(regardless of the misprint on the inside sleeve that says Feb28/69!).There are two things that stand out immediately with these eps.First is The Great Ones' weight loss.He had been up around 290 lbs.,now he was down to about 220 lbs.,a laudable achievement.He would drop down a further 15 or more lbs.in the unsuing years.The second thing that hits you is the plethora of guest stars appearing on these shows.Milton Berle,Joey Heatherton,Paul Lynde,Donald O'Connor,Mike Douglas,Bing Crosby and many well known character actors.Great to see and hear these stars once again.As always this show was filmed live on a Friday night at the Miami Beach Colliseum for airing the next night.There were no laugh tracks as all reactions were genuine.And Gleason would rarely allow re-takes or stoppages in the filming.In fact for the auditorium audience it was a non stop show.In between scenes/costume changes,others acts would take the stage to entertain them,so it was truly constant fun in the sun for them.There was however a very unexpected stoppage in the filming.During the second to last ep""We're off to see the Wizard"",I noticed that while singing one of their numbers that Gleason was stumbling a little more than usual with the lyrics;he was distracted for some reason.At the end of the show we are told the reason why by Gleason himself.It seems someone had come up on stage during filming and all proceedings came to a halt.The reason for the on stage intrusion is not told but Gleason you could tell was more than a little perturbed at it.It took alot to rattle the Great One,but this obviously had.Another thing I noticed that was unsual for Jackie was that on more than one occasion during these shows you will see him lose his composure during a scene.This is especially evident during ""Happiness is a Rich Uncle"".The actor that played Alices' uncle was doing a great job.In fact he was playing it so over the top that as the camera was shifting from Gleason and Norton over to the uncle you can see Jackie laughing at him,obviously enjoying the performance as much as the audience.It is a priceless moment.Further,at the end of the show Jackie himself admits doing it at least twice during the performance,hoping""the camera didn't pick it up"".It did and,as I say,it is priceless to see.I also might mention that you will see while watching these shows the ""times"" creeping into the scripts more than ever.Womens Lib in ""The Honeymoon is Over"" and youth protests in ""Operation Protest"".As always the June Taylor dancers are absolutely fantastic.Their choreography is magnificent and it is a shining example of Gleasons' penchant for hiring the best talent available.And as always with a live shoot and Gleasons' penchant for continuing shooting,you will see little faux pauxs occuring with the dancers too,like missed turns or drops;and always the floor after their opening number is strewn with bits and pieces of fallen costumes.Lyn Duddy and Jerry Bresler continued their amazing work during the making and filming of all these shows.I can't imagine having to come up with music and lyrics week in and week out and of the high caliber these two talented peoples' songs were.Incredible.ANOTHER nod to Gleasons' innate ability for picking the right people for the right job.Johnny Olson of course was the announcer for the series,in short time to become immortalized as Bob Barkers' announcer on ""The Price is Right"".The end of this series was pretty much the swan song of Jackie on television on a regular basis,except for the odd Honeymooners special,of which there is one included as an extra on this set along with an interview with Jane Kean.Yes,1970 was a terrible year for television.Even though Jackies' show was constantly high in the ratings,""demographics"" was the buzz word now.The exces were now gearing programming to the up and coming generation now entering or about to enter the work force;completely ignoring the fact that the younger gen loved the Gleason shows as much as their parents did,if not more.Whenever Honeymooners were on reruns(the Classic 39),it was proven that it was the younger audiences (18-35)that were dutifully out there loving and watching the Kramden's,more so than the older generation.So much for ""demographics"".Along with Gleason,the longest running western in tv history,Gunsmoke,and another long running stalwart Red Skelton,also got canned.In a short time Mr.Sunday night Ed Sullivan would see the chopping block too.No one took it as hard as Skelton who,in not a graceful mood,threatened to burn his entire output of shows and vowed to never have them shown again...which his estate so far has continued to do.A pity.In closing I must say I got the biggest kick out of the this the last set of the Colour Honeymooners Vol#Four,that MPI video has released.It's nostalgic of course for those of us who first watched them back in the 60s, but it is now a valuable chapter in television history that plays out before your eyes and is a very welcome sight in these times,in a television landscape that today is terribly lacking in quality.There simply have been no shows of this caliber or type on tv for decades.You are getting all the shows minus their opening monlogues by Gleason.They are all in colour of course(still the ""new"" thing back then) and with various small anomalies(dirt,sound drop outs,etc) all inherent in the existing tape masters.These shows are pure enjoyment and a must have for all Gleason fans or fans of good,simple and clean tv entertainment.Long live The Great One.Now MPI,how about the late 50 and early to mid-60s Jackie Gleason shows?",N/A

1196933,"Sure, The Matrix is not very realistic, but it's sci-fi. I thought this was going to be a more believable, regular action movie. But regular action movies don't feature assassins using centrifical force to make bullets curve out of guns, or make the bullets turn corners and go around things like a miniature guided missle. Not to mention being able to aim exactly where to land their cars after flipping them through the air. And what kind of assassin training prepares them to survive inside a high-speed train car that plummets thousands of feet down a canyon? Just a little overkill on the incredible here. If this were a movie version of Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, then it would be OK! Oh yeah, you get shot? No problem, just submerge yourself into some high-tech mix of water and concrete, and presto! You're healed within minutes!This just didn't feel like a real sci-fi type movie, so to me it's just a highly unrealistic action movie.And were the screenwriters trying to set some kind of record as to how many times they could squeeze the f-word into their script? Even the nerdy fat-lady boss spews the f-word seemingly more times per minute than Eddie Murphy in Raw! A lame, cop-out attempt to spice up the script that just doesn't work. A real turn-off...I don't mind much hearing it if it's just here and there, but regular, dignified-looking people in an office setting rattling it off every three seconds is a bit overkill.I guess this is based on some comic series, but the characters in this movie just don't have much pizzaz or personality--they're just regular hoods, and McAvoy's character is just some geek who turns into some Rambo type within six weeks. The plainness of these characters don't lend themselves to a story with such crazily unrealistic action.

827624,"In early 2004 I saw Takeshi Kitano's ZATOICHI in the local cinema, intrigued by a Japanese feature but knowing nothing of the long tradition of films with Zatoichi, the blind swordsman. I never did see the earlier films with Shintaro Katsu, but I continue to enjoy Takeshi Kitano's take on the character. The plot is fairly basic, rival gangs are fighting for control of a small town, and the locals are obliged to pay increasing amounts protection money. Into this steps Zatoichi, played by Takeshi himself, as well as another itinerant swordsman who seeks to do the dirty work of one of the gangs in order to help his sick wife. Zatoichi falls in with a poor farmer, as do two geishas who are traveling about to get revenge on the gang members who killed their parents. Over the course of the films, Zatoichi proceeds to slay an enormous amount of people, with some vivid CGI blood painted over each fatal sword blow. In spite of the generic setup, the production values and a few of the twists in the story make this an enjoyable film.I know that Takeshi has been criticized for completely doing away with the back story around Zatoichi. Here the only sign that he has a past at all is when a gang member says, ""Could this blind man be Zatoichi"", and a flashback where he silently kills a group of nameless foes. Instead, Takeshi brings the character between the two extremes of charming, but taciturn, old blind man and unstoppable killing machine. But nonetheless, I like how universal the Zatoichi character is, even when he is as mechanical as Kitano sometimes makes him. The archetype of the man of piercing intelligence who fains disability or madness appears in Western art from Hamlet to Russian holy fools, so all audiences will respond to Zatoichi. And sure, the action is sometimes hard to believe, but Takeshi knows this and has injected a level of grim humour into the film.My only complaint about the film's action is that the final battle between Zatoichi and the bodyguard is anticlimactic. After building up the polarity between them for over an hour, there could have been more to it than a single blow. In addition, the soundtrack strikes me as exceedingly lame until the nice taiko drumming that closes the film.I cannot comment on SONATINE, as in my market the two films were not released together.",N/A

Father escapes with half a magical root, giving the other half to his son.  Now his son, with the rest of the Lightning League who, must find it, to combine the two halves and SAVE the universe.  If they can find the Father.  Who is also being chased by the EVIL plant-car-creatures.  The EVIL plant-machines call themselves Monster Minds, which seems kind of a give away, and their leader is the EVIL Saw Boss.  EVIL!  Oops, lets move on.The whole cartoon, like most cartoons, was made to sell something.  In this case action figures with fighting Road Warrior kind of cars that fought alien Road Warrior kind of cars.  Think cars with saws, guns, lasers and arms.  While there is little to no character development and the story never gets past the quest phase, my young mind at the time just enjoyed the combat and, for the time, the advanced artwork.  This is an American, kind of, cartoon yet the designs and artwork has the feel of an Japanese anime.Magic, science fiction, rogue pilots, pirates, bounty hunters, and robotic cars.  This had everything my young heart wanted.  Herc Stormsailor is the character I liked the most - he is Hans Solo in cartoon form.  Once he even responded to a insult by saying - Who are you calling scruffy?  He loved money, his space barge Pride of the Skies II was always in need of repair, and he has a interesting background which is slowly revealed during the show.  Seems he worked on BOTH sides of the law and knows some people in high places.The music is great and the battles were fun.  Some of the episodes, like Ghostship seem to have been thoughtfully plotted out, others were just shot-them-ups, bang-bang, which was great for a kid.  Yet Steel Against Shadow, by J. Michael Straczynski, had a very heavy hand when dealing with the Good vs. EVIL theme, with little or no action.  In other words - BOO!  LAME!  More explosions!  Who wants themes and thoughtfully stuff - more mindless firing of weapons into the massed ranks of the EVIL enemy!This set is the first part of the series and I plan to look for volume 2 when it comes out.  Many of my memories seem to be from the latter episodes and I hope to enjoy them too!Good for small kids or adults who like to watch cartoons with lots of explosions, lasers, war machines while eating pizza and thinking of high school.

82912,"I want to clarify that the upgrade is in the second disc, the first disc is basically the same great looking 2002 release (complete with the original bonus material).The only exception is that the Deleted Scenes have been moved over to disc 2.  Strangely, the Theatrical Promos have been copied over to disc 2 also, but they are still included on disc 1.I believe this is essentially the intended 2004 2-Disc set that never got released, but with some updates to the 2+ hour documentary on disc 2.  Which also explains why no Blu-Ray, this is not a re-mastering of the movie.  But for regular DVD you can not complain, the movie looks great.  This also means those upgrading, like me, don't have to worry that something was changed (like the recent Piniocchio re-master) and they can get rid of their original DVD.For the serious animation fan, disc 2 is the disc we have long been waiting for.  Upgrading to this set is a no-brainer, yes - upgrade.But if you just like the movie & have no interest in how it was made, then the original single disc version is good enough.  There is no need to buy it again.However, this could be one of the big marketing snafu's of Disney history.1) In 2004 this movie was still at the height of its popularity, today it is almost forgotten.  Had this come out in 2004 it would have been a big media spash.  Sales would have been through the roof (not tomention the better economy then).2) This 2-disc release was released the very same day as the new-to-DVD Bolt.  All eyes & promotions seem to focused on Bolt.3) Today Blu-Ray is the way to go for serious fans & there is no Blu-Ray release of this 2-disc version.

373902,"I never thought I'd say this about a film made in my adult lifetime, but they just don't make them like this anymore. From 1975 until the early 1990's the miniseries was one of the mainstays of broadcast TV. In the better ones - which this was - the production values were high, the story intricately told, and prominent stars were involved.In this day of people who seem to believe that they deserve what they have simply because they have always lived this way, this story of the super-rich set against the background of the Great Depression is timely.Gloria Morgan is the bride of 43 year-old Reggie Vanderbilt at 18, a mother at 19, and a widow at 20 when her husband, whose health has been ruined by a dissolute lifestyle, dies and leaves her penniless. The fact that she is the mother of one of Reggie's two surviving children leaves her the impoverished mother of a wealthy infant. As Gloria is an infant, though, and she is the surviving parent, big Gloria has an income of 48 thousand dollars a year on which to live, a limitation over which she complains endlessly. 48 thousand dollars a year would be roughly half a million dollars annually in today's currency.Over the next ten years or so, Gloria travels around Europe and complains when the judge that is her daughter's guardian says that she must come back to America so that little Gloria can grow up there, as per their prior agreement. She gripes that she can't live the way she wants and that it is all Gloria's fault. Big Gloria seems to forget she would be living in a cardboard box were it not for little Gloria's existence. Eventually big Gloria's lifestyle, her vengeful mother, and little Gloria's religious nurse all work against her when her former sister-in-law, Gertrude, sues for custody of Gloria.There are really no sympathetic characters in this story. The doctors are more than glad to give quack treatments to little Gloria and take the Vanderbilt money, the lawyers -as always - are glad to take anyone's money, the judge in the case is more interested in the Vanderbilt's opinion than justice, and Big Gloria doesn't come across so much as a bad mother as she does as someone who simply knows no other way to live than the way she has been living. Not exactly having a glowing example of motherhood upon which to rely, Big Gloria seems genuinely baffled as to why everyone is upset with her.Unfortunately, miniseries such as these have been replaced with one reality show after another all of which are just variations on the theme ""Human Beings Behaving Badly"". 27 years from now I doubt anyone will be interested in them other than as exhibits on a degenerating culture. This film was a theatric reproduction of an actual true story, and for that reason it surprises me that Gloria Warren Vanderbilt's story has so many parallels in the biography of silent film star Lina Basquette. Her tragic tale can be found in the bookLina Demille's Godless Girl. This is a rare title, but it is good reading if you can find it.",Little Gloria Happy at Last VHS
1130448,"This is, along with the disc for season two, absolutely one of the funniest television series' I have ever seen.  The voice acting is brilliant.  I couldn't more highly recommend this, at least for those resilient enough to endure the vulgarity.Couple minor factoids for all you FD enthusiasts out there:When Killface gets run over by his friend Barnaby and then in his delirium sings out Barnaby's name, he does it to the theme of ""The Courtship of Eddy's Father,"" a television series maybe starring Bill Bixby or somebody in the early 70s.When Ta'Quil grabs the core of the Annihilatrix and makes his heroic dive, the sound effect was borrowed from ""The Six Million Dollar Man.""There are some concealed elements of literature here, and a surprising depth of character and plot, at least at times.  Didn't realize until this evening that when Barnaby gets soap in his eyes in the shower -- I just thought it was the lamest joke in the whole show -- turns out it was primitive foreshadowing for when, well you know.  And (spoiler) when Kenneth spots the big pants first and wins the gold doubloon, that of course is straight out of Moby Dick.This series is AWESOME, even if it's a little scattered sometimes.  Like I had no problem whatsoever with Stan's cloning himself, but if I were to ever show it to my girlfriend I'm afraid she would need some explanation for that, just because it kinda came from out of nowhere.  And lots of other little stuff, almost as if the process of scripting and writing this series was done partially on the fly, and little incidental ""artifacts"" got left in the story without any connection to anything else.  It's inconsequential really, but you notice them if you watch a zillion times like I have.And as for the vulgar humor, for example exactly what's a teabag?  If you watch this with your girlfriend and she doesn't know what a teabag is, maybe you should steer clear of this one and go watch a more girlfriend-friendly movie.  Which is one of the reasons I don't show this, one of my favorite comedy vids, to my GF.  The lewd, juvenile male-oriented humor.I really would like to form a Wendell Stamps fan club.And I would really love to see a movie based on this series.  And it would be really great to get Chris Penn to play Wendell Stamps, too.  For Cody.",N/A
1175444,"In Drive-In Cult Classics Volume 1, the viewer got a collection of trashy but fun dramas which focused on illicit sex and death.  I have not watched Volume 2, which is a set of low-budget horror movies, some of which have even made it to Mystery Science Theater.  Volume 3, however, is a true mish-mash of movies, but are overall pretty fun.  All come from Crown International Pictures, a distributor of cheesy exploitation flicks (with a definite inclination towards gratuitous nudity).Volume 3 has eight movies on four discs.  On the first disc is The Babysitter and Weekend with the Babysitter, a pair of generally unrelated but similar movies.  Each involves a middle-aged man (played by the same actor in both movies) having a fling with his child's babysitter and in the process getting entangled with crime.  The Babysitter is the only black-and-white movie in the set.Disc 2 has The Pink Angels and Blood Mania.  Blood Mania is basically a suspense story with a lot of sex and a bit of trippiness.  The Pink Angels is nominally a comedy, but it lacks any real laughs.  It's the story of a gang of gay bikers.  They don't actually do anything with each other, but instead are just an over-the-top collection of gay stereotypes.  Even for those who find this movie likeable will be put off by the ending where things take an abrupt turn.Things get both better and worse on Disc 3.  Single Room Furnished is a rare Crown attempt to be arty, with an adaptation of a play about the tragic love life of a young woman.  Unfortunately, the movie is too stagy and the acting and writing are subpar, led by Jayne Mansfield in her final role before her death in a car accident.On the other side of Disc 3 is the first of a threesome of similar movies that continue on Disc 4.  All three are late-`70s teen sex comedies.  Van Nuys Blvd. (on Disc 3) romanticizes the era of cruising down the boulevard every Wednesday night.  The Pom Pom Girls focus on some high school football players and their attempts to woo the title characters.  Malibu Beach takes place mostly on Malibu Beach.  All three are reasonably interchangeable:  I enjoyed Van Nuys Blvd. the best (it seemed to have the most likeable characters), but they're all decent and pieces of cinematic greatness compared to some of the other Crown fare.Overall, this is another collection of trashy fun; I enjoyed all these films with the exception of Single Room Furnished (more boring than bad) and to a lesser extent, Pink Angels.  There are even a couple extras:  a commentary and a couple movie trailers.  For what these movies are - cheap entertainment - this is a good set to pick up.",N/A
1226574,"(NOTE:This review is in response to the original HBO presentation/airing and not of it's future home DVD release)Presented and watched as one four hour block (with each of it's four parts averaging around 58 minutes each) this was one well cast and performed HBO/BBC production on the reign of Saddam Hussein. Showcasing the years between his take-over of the Presidency of Iraq in 1979 up thru his execution in 2006, this mini-series was well informative and even at it's length, not very dragging in parts. And don't think this is all about Saddam either, his family and fellow soldier/followers are in full force here too. And each part is extremely well-played, even reaching the point where recreated news-footage makes you think you're seeing the real thing. If there was any fault of this mini-series it lied in the final fourth act, basically showcasing Saddam's hiding exile, going from Iraq's largest leader to a pauper hiding in a hole (just like it was in real life). But not being a Hussein historian by any means (who'd want to?), I truly felt that this script followed the insane leader and those around him to a tee. Quite disturbing in parts without being too graphic (Saddam had a thing about his relatives getting to close to greatness...he didn't like it) and showing a side of the madman you may not expect (he loved film-making, especially if the star was playing him), this is one mini-series highly suggested to anyone who doubts taking him out of power wasn't the right thing to do or a neccesary evil. Would love to see some interviews with the cast on how each of them channeled these characters so well, will probably purchase this on DVD and sit through the dark-subject four hours even again.(RedSabbath Rating:9.0/10)",N/A
147829,"Do not believe the Coen Brothers when they this is a true story. But it is something that can happen. People have been known to stage `wife kidnappings' for various reasons and things often go wrong in any crime.Things do go horrendously wrong for William H Macy's car salesman character here, with  Frances McDormand (the local sheriff) hot on his trail. She's pregnant and tired, but she does not give up. The two small-time criminals (played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) hired by Macy for the dastardly deed seemingly cannot do anything right and leave a trail of bodies and blood on the snow. Of course, they do fall out with each other by the end of the movie and one of them ends up in a wood chipper.The movie has plenty of light moments and humor despite the high body count and you will get a load of the Minnesota accent and dialect by the time it finishes. But all these elements are well integrated into the movie so that no incident feels out of place. The editor has done a superb job.This movie will be remembered for its lush photography. The brilliant white snowy landscapes will challenge your telly and please your eyes. The blu-ray transfer is obviously not top grade, but this is the best picture available on any home video release of Fargo. The sound too is average, but then this is a dialogue driven movie with some action in between.This is one of the Coens' best efforts, eclipsed only by their recent hits such as No Country for Old Men. It is not a walk in the park,  for this is a movie that depends heavily on violent undertones.  Fargo is a memorable film that deserves a place in your movie library.",N/A
1109178,"I enjoyed this phenomenal series. Loved the casting of the lead characters. The chemistry between them felt very real.L.A. private eye Mick St. John played by the gorgeous Alex O'Loughlin, has a secret. His bride, Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon), turned him into a vampire on their wedding night 60 years prior.Now a vampire, he's living in a covert netherworld complicated by memories of his alluring ex-wife Coraline, and his relationship with a human, Beth Turner (Sophia Myles) whom he feels drawn to protect (since he saved her from his then vampire-wife, when she was a child). Now as an adult, Mick is in love with her. But no matter how he feels, Mick knows a vampire-human romance is eternally dangerous. What can he do about his very human feelings for her?And so he struggles in the present day with his dealings with other vampires in the city and his love for the mortal Beth. It was wonderful viewing watching the love between them develop and unfold.Then there's the charming, boyishly good-looking, happily amoral Josef Kolstan ( Jason Dohring), the undead finance honcho, with centuries of wisdom and his own sad past. Josef is the only person whom Mick trusts and values his friendship. Loved their at times off-beat dialogue.A truly enjoyable series, a great pity that it ended after only one season.Oh well, at least they gave us a decent closure.",N/A
1246312,"It's here, the next installment in the line-up of hits from the DC Animated Universe. Everytime one of these movies is released not only am I eager to see the film. I am also always excited to see the preview for their next project. The Green Lantern seemed to a project that the entire staff was very eager to do most likley because the Green Lantern is one of the DC comic chatacters that has not been given much face time outside of the comic books. The Green Lantern is probably one of the most popular comic characters next to the major DC heavy hitters. Probably because of the creativity of the characters, the complexity of the universe GL is in. Or maybe, just that awesome pledge he says.'Green Lantern: First Flight' really is the very first Green Lantern movie period and I have to admit as much as I was anticipating to opportunity to see it I was still very much surprised. This film is more than just an origin stroy. In fact it really is the story after the origin. The premise of this film is now that Hal Jorden is The Greeen Lantern what happened after that? The story is more about what it takes to be a Green Lantern. The viewer is taken on a roller coaster of a story as the members of the Green Lantern Corp take care of business. Busting crime throughout the universe and of course beating up the baddies. Yet, while they believe everything is fine, there may just be a baddie among them. The viewer of course will get a kick out this film because while it may be Hal Jordans' first mission he is being trained by his future arch nemesis Sinestro. Hal definitely picked an interesting time to be chosen.Like the previous projects from Bruce Timm and company, this one is just as gritty and exciting as it's predecessors. This movie is a great origional story for Green Lantern fans. It's got Hal Jordan, Sinestro and the Green Lantern history everything a Green Lantern fan craves in an orginal 'Training Day' like story. The voices for the characters are well matched and the action is great, with a few unexpected plot twists and surprises. Now I think the guys working on the 2011 live action Green Lanter movie should definitely check this one out...it could give them a couple of pointers.",N/A

So, my purchase ended up going to a friend.The placing of Razor within the Season Four boxset was odd to me, but I guess it was because of production and it's just sort of where it got placed.I thought that Razor was interesting, but I wasn't overall thrilled with it.  Perhaps, it was because I didn't appreciate it as others may have when they were waiting for more BSG to air.There were some parts were I really appreciated it, but mostly I just was disgusted with the Pegasus and Cain in general.

39446,"This is probably the only horror movie in the last 25 years that really made me want to look away from the screen.  Since that's exactly what you're looking for in this type of film, I'd say this one really delivers the goods.  It's vastly superior, IMO, to all of the previous installments in the series, including the original, which only hinted at what this one makes us experience.  The performances are, without exception, outstanding.  Of course, R. Lee Ermey gives his typically brilliant performance, but everyone else is believable and real as well.  There's something very cathartic about getting your pulse up during an over-the-top horror film; maybe it's one way of dealing with the ultimate truth of our mortality and deepest fears.  If you like extreme horror, you need to see this movie.  It will stay with you long after the final credits.",N/A
1212455,"You've got to admire the historical heart that writer/producer Christopher McQuarrie, director Bryan Singer, and star Tom Cruise bring to Valkyrie; in which Cruise stars as the scarred Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, who becomes invited into, and eventually heads, an inside plot to kill Hitler (Rome's David Bamber).  Told mostly from Stauffenberg's and his crew's point of view, Valkyrie is clever and often engaging, but the moments of the film that are supposed to be suspenseful just end up coming up pretty empty.  The fact that Cruise is simply miscast as Stauffenberg doesn't help matters either, but what the film does manage to have going for it lies in its attention to detail, and the fact that it features a cast full of familiar faces from across the pond including Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, Eddie Izzard, Thomas Kretschmann, Kenneth Cranham, and an all too briefly seen Kenneth Branagh.

686402,"I was very surprised to read some of the negative comments on this DVD. Vaduva might not be my first choice (it wouldn't be Netrebko)but her voice and physicality suggest the youth and sensitivity one would expect in a Juliette. Subsequent recordings of Vaduva available at one time on CD, a Boheme and an aria collection were disappointing. The Boheme was in particular a disappointment as it has a very starry cast--Vaduva excepted. But I can't criticize her Juliette. Nor the rest of the cast, notably Alagna. What a pleasure to hear him sing French. Surely he will offer us a Faust. But in the meantime I recomment his Romeo the score of which I think is superior to Faust. Interestingly enough the worst music of the Berlioz ""drammatic symphony"" is the music he wrote the Frere Laurence; the same can be said of Gounod's attempt; even with an artist with the distinction of Robert Lloyd he is unable to rise above the banal, but the fault is Gounod's, not Lloyd's. Highly recommended.","Gounod - Romeo et Juliette / Mackerras, Alagna, Vaduva, Royal Opera Covent Garden"
1290437,"Originally an amazing independent animated short by Shane Acker which took him four years to create, it was turned into a full-length motion picture produced by Tim Burton with Acker acting as director. This movie basically juggernauts the concept of ""stitchpunk"".Set in a post-apocalpytic Earth, the film opens up with a small mechanical humanoid burlap sack(which looks like he's out of Little Big Planet)named 9 awakens in a dilapidated building and finds a strange talisman. After realizing the world is in ruins, he encounters 2, another robot like himself. 2 recognizes the talisman as something special, but gets captured by a large robot cat monster. 9 tries to go after him, but is taken in by the other sack-people, each one of which has its own number. Their leader 1 forbids a rescue attempt on 2, but 9 heads out with 2's friend 5. They manage to destroy the cat-bot with the help of the adventurous 7, and 2 is saved. However, 9 gets the talisman and instictively connects it to a large apparatus called the Fabrication Machine activates and sucks the life out of 2 in the process. 9, 7, and 5 run to an abandonned library run by 3 and 4 where they learn the history of the Fabrication Machine. It was made for a dictator-run country who took it from a scientist to create weapons of mass destruction, which of course later on turn on humanity, where in the end they wipe each other out. The scientist who made it survived long enough to put his soul into to the nine seperate robots which make up the little stitch people. The Machine creates a flying robot to capture the other #s, so they seek to stop the it at its source, but not without 7 and 8 getting captured. They manage to free 7 before torching the place, but 8 gets its soul sucked too. After believing they defeated the enemy, the remaining #s settle back for one of the only really cheery moments on the whole movie, only to find out that the Machine survived, which takes 5 and 6 souls too. 9 goes back to the scientist's room where he first awoke to find the secret of the Machine's power. 9 manages to rip the talisman from it after 1 hastily sacrafices himself. The remaining #s then set the souls of the departed ones free into the heavens.The movie is a pretty direct adaptation of Acker's original short movie, except it actually adds the other #s into it, and expands on the whole reason for why the world is the way it is. The animation is very well executed in this, although not much on the Pixar level. It might give off the appearance of a stop-motion production, which is nothing new for Tim Burton, even if it seems to help and sometimes hurt the film in when there are times that they could've elaborated more on the plot and characters instead of going from one chase scene to another. But, the characters are really intriguing, and the dark feel of this forbiding world they live in. There's also a fine sense of scale for these diminutive robots in a land of dead giants. It's a great achievement for having an independent production turned into a feature film. The only real major problem with the movie is that it is a little too short, as minus the closing credits it clocks in about 70 minutes, where they could've added a little more interaction with some of the characters and expanded the plot a little more. But, I'd still recommend this for someone looking for a mature sci-fi adventure film, with some great metaphysical aspects to keep the philosphers happy too.",N/A

I do, however, give him props on showing a loving monogamous relationship between two beautiful women.

But that is to be expected when you have a straight man writing about a subject he has no insight about.

48966,"I recently picked up the extended edition version of ""Dune"". The ""new"" version of the movie now has about 40 minutes of additional content and has been reedited to include it. The movie is now different than what was originally shown in theaters.  After my initial viewing of this new version, I'm a bit divided as to whether it is better or worse than the original. Part of the problem is that I've watched the original film so many times that it's like an old friend.There are some things that I don't like about the new extended version. Number one is that they have replaced the voice-over narration. In the original the narration was done by Princess Irulan (Virginia Madsen). Now in this new version the narration is done by a male voice - which wouldn't really be a problem but he sounds to me like Uncle Joe (Edgar Buchanan) from the 1960's television show ""Petticoat Junction"". The voice narrates at times over the length of the movie - smoothing the transitions of the new scenes as well as explaining situations for people who might not have read the book. Maybe it just me, but I found it annoying. Could be too that I just like the voice of Virginia Madsen. Number two, was that the great Toto soundtrack seemed very muted and at times missing altogether.Some additional notes. The DVD comes in one of those metal DVD cases and the DVD itself is a dual-sided disc. One side has the original version and the bonus material and on the other side is the extended version.Bonus materials includes features on, Deleted Dune - deleted scenes, Designing Dune - development of the visual design, Dune FX - special-effects, Dune Models - models and motion control, Dune Wardrobe - costume design, and a photo gallery of behind-the-scenes photos and artwork.I'm giving this review four-stars mainly because of the bonus materials and the original version, if this disc was just the extended version I would probably only give it two-stars.",N/A
1275610,"Spice and Wolf sounds, by the description, like a typical sudden-girlfriend-appearance anime. Indeed, there are similar ""boy meets cute Goddess girl"" series out there, like Kannagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens. Spice and Wolf, however, is nothing of the sort.It is, instead, a very interesting and well-thought out period piece. The antiquated European setting is ideal for the true essence behind this anime--economy. Lawrence and Holo make a cute pair, to be sure, but this first season only hints at a romantic development between them. Instead, the focus is on a sort of budding professional relationship. The two explore the world town by town, with interesting glimpses into different trading practices, different currencies, and different cultures. The religious presence of a Catholic-esque Church is especially intriguing. They are corrupt in trading methods but effective at spreading faith, something wholly believable.Simple observations like this are one of the things that make this series so great. Its compliment are the characters. Lawrence and Holo are always interesting, and usually funny. Holo's flirtation and Lawrence's inhibitions make for a comedic formula that rarely gets tiring. The best part about their relationship is that, unlike most anime, the audience is not forced to believe in it. The anime takes things slow, letting their relationship build like real ones do--by shared experience. Their frustrations, fears, dreams and humor are all allowed to develop naturally. This may make it seem like there is little character development throughout the series, but there is enough to keep it going.The series of light novels, off of which this anime is based, are still being published. As such, the episodic nature of the show seems to make it come to an abrupt end. This is no problem, however, considering there is a second season already finished in Japan, with a third all but assured. It is worth the small time investment. As it is only one small part of an anticipated whole, it will not be a jaw-dropping, life-changing piece of art, but it will most definitely make your day a little more pleasant. Is this not one of the most admirable aspects of art, anyway, that it can do something so simply profound as to make one feel better?Funimation usually does the most acceptable job of dubbing shows here. Fullmetal Alchemist is an example of some of their good work, and they only seem to learn from their mistakes as a company. And for those who refuse to tolerate dubbing, the original Japanese voice track is amazing, and their subtitling is sure to be, also.This is a series that will grow on you, just as the characters grow on each other.

Although the story and humor are very dated, Eddie Cantor is very funny at times playing the super hypochondriac.There are lots of gags, and like the Marx Brothers films, so many that you can't catch them all. Also like the MB, some of the humor is topical, so audiences of today aren't going to get what people would laugh at in 1930.Through all the jokes - many stupid and many clever - Cantor is a likable guy and also a good singer. The songs in here are decent, too, some of them very catchy. They also have the added attraction of having the Busby Berkeley dancers/girls joining in.Make no mistake: this is a ""sappy"" film, so dated it's extremely stupid in spots....but definitely something for the film collector.

Anyone who wants a ""safe"" film should just put the Miike box down and walk away.  Of course, weird does not always guarantee good.Okada Izo was an actual historical figure, a samurai from the late Edo period and one of the most feared assassins of his time.  He met a messy end, being tortured and crucified, thus ensuring his transformation into a legend.  Gosha Hideo chronicled Izo's life and death in the 1969 film ""Hitokiri.""  Miike Takashi took the challenge of filming Izo's afterlife, setting his film ""Izo"" as a direct sequel to the earlier Gosha movie.The story begins with Izo's death and the resurrection of his angry spirit, which is propelled backwards and forwards in time and space on a perpetual killing spree.  Izo himself does not really understand the motivations of his actions, being guided by some other force, and while he is able to feel pain he can never die again.  He only slaughters, becoming more and more demon-like in appearance (and super-hero-like, complete with mask and cape) and his killing continues.  His ultimate target is thought to be the group that controls humanity, the military, media, scholars and religious figures who conspire to keep people ignorant and controllable.  Towards the end though, Izo has completely forgotten what he is trying to accomplish, and just cuts down anyone in front of him.In order to create some buzz and interest in a somewhat esoteric project, the producers of ""Izo"" went with a ""dream team"" casting of pairing popular auteur Kitano ""Beat"" Takeshi (Fireworks) with the rogue director Miike Takashi (Audition).  This duo alone had massive drawing power, although they decided to hedge their bets by sticking in other stars like Momoi Kaori (Love and Honor), Matsuda Ryuhei (Cutie Honey - The Movie (Live Action)) and even popular K-1 fighter Bob Sapp.With this in mind, ""Izo"" is packed with great bits.  Surprisingly, Kitano Takeshi gets very little screen time.  From the advertising, I would have thought he was a main character, but his is only a minor role.  The Bob Sapp battle was very cool, and there are several outstanding sequences. One really great piece of ""Izo"" was the interstitial sequences of the ""screaming philosopher"" and acid-folk guitaristTomokawa Kazuki.  His particular voice and style of music added a perfect grounding point to the chaos of the film.Ultimately, however, ""Izo"" just didn't really work for me.  I could see what Miike was trying to accomplish (Izo as a metaphor for humanities capacity for violence.  The thought-controlling group that dictates what people think.  How ""righteous vengeance"" can deteriorate into cruel killing for killing's sake...) but it was all just too muddled together.  There were many, many great scenes, but on the whole the film was dragging and repetitive.  Izo's grand killing spree eventually just becomes...boring.  And maybe that was a point Miike was trying to make too.",N/A
753962,"Travolta's films can be categorized into two categories: Pulp Fiction and Everything Else. Basic, of course, belongs to the latter. This movie is like watching an episode of Law & Order with a bigger budget. It is so formulaic, using the ""twists 'n turns"" strategy of past films to create a senseless story whose ending negates the need for its making in the first place.Top Ten Sign of Cliches include but are not limited to:1. Sexual tension between Travolta and the female lead2. The whodunnit flashbacks that are told differently each time by each person involved3. The drug smuggling plot carried out by the law abiding, upright guy you'd never think was the crook4. The ""usual suspects"" type ending where pieces of the puzzle all fall into place at the final moments5. The main character who has a drinking problem (just for the sake of flavor)6. Fights and shouting scenes you can seeing coming a mile away7. Constant backtracking by the main characters and the need to confront potential suspects again, each time with angrier words and fist throwing8. The mimicking environment rain storm that underscores the tension, and when Big Revelations are discovered, ""Crack!"" goes the lightning9.

I couldn't help but thinking, throughout the movie, that this was like Jack Bauer in a Stephen King movie.  The mirror ""concept"" at the end of the film made for a nice bit of ontological horror.

1276301,"Rowan Atkinson was funny as Mr. Bean, but he was downright hilarious as the Black Adder. He had such a talent for playing the sharp-tongued rogue I'll never figure out why he decided to start doing comedy in which he hardly spoke. The premise of this British comedy series is that the central character, ""The Black Adder"", shows up at different points in history in various incarnations distorting historical events and poking fun at various British historical figures and situations along the way.Lots of people don't like Black Adder I, in which the title character, Edmund, is the younger son of a brutish man consumed with thoughts of war who actually becomes king of England through Edmund's own bungling - he arrives late for the Battle of Bosworth Field and winds up chopping off the head of Richard III, thus saving the life of Henry Tudor. Throughout this first season he plays the buffoon, often having the expression of a deer caught in the headlights. This is the only season in which the Black Adder takes on the persona of a weak effeminate person. Especially funny is Edmund's mother who is a proper noble woman sitting around doing embroidery and indifferently waiting for the next marauding army to pass through.The second season takes place early during the reign of Elizabeth I, with the Black Adder confident, handsome, and even a favorite at court. A young Amanda Richardson plays the role of Elizabeth I, who comes across as Betty Boop, just not as intelligent. Although more cunning in this season, Black Adder still comes up the loser in just about every episode. My favorite is ""Bells"", in which Blackadder finds his new servant, Bob, curiously pleasant company. Afraid for his reputation at court, Blackadder searches for a ""cure"" - which of course involves leeches, until Bob conveniently reveals that she is in fact a girl called Kate. Their wedding is disrupted by the profane Lord Flashheart, who, although he is the best man, winds up stealing the bride.The third season takes place in the eighteenth century during the reign of George III, and will be a favorite of all fans of ""House, M.D."" due to the presence of a young Hugh Laurie. Here, Black Adder plays the manservant of the Prince Regent, George, played by Hugh Laurie. George is the dim-witted target of Black Adder's many schemes to enrich himself by taking advantage of his cushy position in George's household, and this often means having to save the Prince Regent's pension and position in the kingdom, which is largely controlled by Parliament.The fourth season takes place during World War I, with Edmund Blackadder as a captain in the British army whose company is trapped in one of the trenches that gave everyone in Europe such a distaste for warfare between the two world wars. Blackadder's aim in this season is to stay alive by staying in that trench until the war ends. His stunts include shooting a carrier pigeon when it arrives with orders to advance, and joining the Royal Flying Corp - ""the twenty minuters"". Unfortunately, the name comes from how long they are expected to live once in the air, not how much time they work each day, as Blackadder had originally thought.This show has several interesting plot devices. First, most of the main characters show up in different periods of time with the same name but different roles. Hugh Laurie is always ""George"", Tony Robinson is always ""Baldrick"", Stephen Fry is always ""Melchett"", and Tim McInnerny is always ""Percy"". Since each season was shot in alternate years - (1983, 1985, 1987, 1989) - the cast must have been having a terrific time in order for them to be regathered after such long intervals in order to make filming this series possible. Secondly, everyone in the cast, including the Black Adder, always dies in the final episode of each season. It is somewhat like the South Park stunt of Kenny being killed at the end of every show only to reappear in the next episode as though nothing had happened.Do note that there are only six episodes per season. If you liked ""Red Dwarf"" or ""Fawlty Towers"", you'll probably like this series too.As for extra features, disc five contains the specials. The Cavalier Years has Stephen Fry as King Charles and Warren Clarke as Oliver Cromwell.  There is also Blackadder's Christmas Carol and Back and Forth. Christmas Carol is pretty funny, but I've never cared for Back and Forth.Disc six contains the documentary Blackadder Rides Again, a 90-minute special with the behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage from the fourth season included. There's also a look back at the costumes used in Costumes Revisited, along with extended interviews and audio commentaries with the key actors. As for the audio commentaries, Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry, Ben Elton, Richard Curtis, Tony Robinson, Tim McInnerny and producer John Lloyd have all contributed to these.",N/A

1072161,"Honestly, when I see some of the tags and reviews on this movie, it amazes me that you even sat down to watch it, and the actuality that you cannot have grasped a single thing on the screen.I mean let's get the cat out of the bag here-and-now and get to what really matters... this movie has NUDITY! If a couple shots of the female form is going to get your panties in a bunch then don't sit down to watch this film, please. Though cover art can be deceiving one should assume that the image of a possibly semi-naked girl might imply some nudity.With that being said, 2006's Cashback is a story about newly single Ben Willis(Sean Biggerstaff, of Harry Potter fame) an art student who's break-up has given him an unshakable case of insomnia.Ben realizes his inability to sleep might be fruitful if he gets a job, therefore he becomes employed at a local grocery store as a night janitor. With a crazy bunch of co-workers and his own special way of stopping time help to maintain any sense of his sanity against the long, tedious shifts and abrasive customers. Ben feels like he's barely getting by when he meets Sharon(Emilia Fox) a quiet checkout girl who works at the market, and who just might be the perfect distraction.Cashback portrays an artists mind perfectly and beautifully as we examine Ben's ability to 'stop time' and admire every bit of beauty  around him, even in the hell hole he seems to be stuck in he can find beauty.""I read once about a woman whose secret fantasy was to have an affair with an artist. She thought he would really see her. He would see every curve, every line, every indentation and love them because they were part of the beauty that made her unique.""It's not for everyone, but if you can open your eyes to the beauty that is Cashback, you will surely enjoy it.",Cashback

I don't know.Any new lost footage? I don't know.Any kind of newer extras not on the ""Anniversary version""? I don't know.Any other information anywhere online about what's on it at all? I don't know.Remastered? They were the first time around.Blu-Ray? Yes, but this could have been done with the same package.You see where I'm going here. To quote the A&E; website, who is also selling it, they are only saying ""Within this complete 17-episode set, all is revealed. Or is it?""Now what kind of garbagey pap is that? What's the technical end? What's included that is different from what's already out there? It makes me wonder why they even needed to remake a ""Collector's Set"" in the first place.It is essentially the ""40th Anniversary"" DVD box set, just repackaged with a new set of covers. As far as I can see from the item descriptions of both sets IT'S THE SAME ITEM THEY SOLD TO US A FEW YEARS BACK.To be honest, I was happy with that set as it fed my obsession, and I thought there was nowhere else to go with it.

But the question remains: Why are they doing this?Well, it's simple: to sell DVD sets to lots of naive customers who didn't know the ""Anniversary Set"" exists and then buy essentially the SAME ITEM at a higher price!Used box sets of the ""40th"" are pretty cheap right now, so why buy the redesigned package? - except to make A&E; a few dollars more. Oh, and it's no small coincidence that they are releasing it about the same time as the upcoming AMC series ""Prisoner"" reboot.This is sad, and once again, A&E; should be ashamed of themselves.And, to sidebar a moment about that new series...Now, even though Ian McKellen has been chosen to play Number Two (and that's okay), how can anyone justify American actor Jim Caviezel as Number Six when we all know this was a British actor's dream role?I really can't really name a movie or show he's been in where he impressed me EXCEPT for his performance in ""Frequency,"" which according to the IMDB website, is all he's ever done in the sci-fi realm.I guess I'm picky when it comes to my choice of The Prisoner, because you would think they'd put someone in there with a backbone - and DOESN'T CRY IN EVERY SINGLE ROLE HE'S BEEN IN. This potentially sounds HORRIBLE.I say give me Clive Owen, he seems sullen enough, and he proved to me he could tackle the complexities of sci-fi in his dazzling role in ""Children of Men.""(Back to the DVD review, as I'm digressing too much here... but to get a bit personal now...)Cash is king and AMC and A&E; are warming their collective hands over the bones of the highly-protective-of-the-series Patrick McGoohan, whom they waited patiently until he died so that they could then start mining his show that he created and wanted left untouched.And to be honest, there are more than a few of us who'd also like to leave this kept pure as well. No, we didn't need a remake or a reboot, and there are SO many people I know who've asked why do it at all?The release of this DVD set only goes to show me integrity, like clothing, can be shed for the right price, and AMC and A&E; will NEVER receive another consumer dollar from ME.Once again, since there are no technical details available anywhere except from what I found on this very website, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to assume that it's the same set just re-packged to deceive people, and because of that I'm giving this one star.THERE IS NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT WHAT'S ON IT THAT'S NEW, so why award a company clearly out for profit?For the last time, and I'll be honest, it won't be the last time for me... A&E; should BE ASHAMED OF ITSELF for doing this.I'm going to tell everyone I know to watch out for this deception AND NOT BUY THIS SET until I mysteriously vanish or this review is deleted, and since I'm the first one here to voice my dissention, I'll be on some faraway island soon enough, assigned a number, and then be forced to watch Jim Caviezel cry.Thanks for reading, and before I mysteriously die or vanish, read my other reviews and find out the truth for yoursel================================",N/A

They just don't make movies like those anymore. John Ford loved to shoot in the Mounument Valley mainly because he seached for realizim. Mounument Valley today is like it was a 100+ years ago. The action sequences are very well done. The story line well written, I don't think you could find a better movie than Wagonmaster.

In the lead Jason Statham gives the kind of performance, Stallone would've brought to the film if it were re-made ten years ago. Statham is given plenty of choices to get hit, throw punches and deliver one-liners. In the second male lead as Machine Gun Joe, Tyrese pretty much walks through the role. One would expect Tyrese to have a ball with the role, but ironically he seems bored with the role.

1243483,"If you are a fan of poorly executed, low budget, monster flicks, Razortooth fits the bill nicely.  You are extremely charitable, if you care about any of the characters, who are neither interesting nor particularly likeable.Somewhere in Florida, a scientist's experimental creation is loose in the swamps, the creature is apparently a giant mutated Asian eel.  Eels are fish that breathe through gills, but greenish, bug-eyed Razortooth, is also able to travel swiftly on land, moving like a snake.  When a couple of prison escapees head into the swamp, the police out to recapture them, become the first victims.  From there, blood starts to spatter, and the bodies quickly pile up, as the eel starts to feed on the clueless locals.The Sheriff (Kathleen LaGue) and her animal control officer ex-husband (Doug Swander), lead a group formed to deal with the threat, which includes the scientist and his helpers.  The inept posse hasn't a chance of success, and the fun really starts as the Razortooth eels continue to chomp up victim after victim.  The CGI eel doesn't look much like a real eel, and isn't particularly well-done until the very end, but even so it is still the film's most interesting character.  Since it appears that air guns are used as props, use of firearms is minimal, and a crossbow becomes the weapon designated to kill the creature.  A plan that is naturally doomed to failure.Razortooth is fun and entertaining, on a very basic bloody, creature feature level.

1226662,"NOTE: There is an update of interest at the end of this review. DOUBT has a potent albeit badly delivered message; it has stellar performances that nonetheless come too close to caricature. It is always unwise to attempt to insert levity where levity is not welcome.Meryl Streep's turn as Sister-Mother-Superior-Wannabe Aloysius (correct spelling is Aloisius by the bye) is simultaneously shocking, powerful and silly. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the beleaguered (and probably guilty) Father Flynn is a character study worthy of Spencer Tracy. He has his dark side and dark moments.What are we, the audience, supposed to doubt? Streep's sanity? Hoffman's sincerity? Didn't the sweet, angelic Sr. James (Amy Adams) steal the show completely? Did Father Flynn abuse young Donald Miller (played beautifully by Joseph Foster II and miscredited at the end as ""Daniel Miller"")? Was he merely protecting young Donald? Did he identify with young Donald's emerging gayness (something Donald's mother clearly discloses to Streep)?Will the question marks ever end??In a way, this film is sheer insanity-in-the-making. A wicked witch of a nun, overburdened as a school's principal, automatically hates and suspects the young priest working at the school. She's out to get him, because she can smell a rat at a hundred paces. Yet as I discovered years later, she was right.There really is something awful, something 'funny', about Father Flynn. His nails really are too long. He resents the Church and its Medievalism. He dislikes the principal for her very crumbly old-fashioned ways. When confronted, he seems innocent and purely motivated. That is, until his facade begins to crack in an ugly way, and we see a guilty, evasive criminal-type. It's a type I know well among the clergy of the Catholic Church.We know the era of pedophile priests had begun to emerge into the public eye at this time, the late 1960s. So, did the priest victimize a ready-made victim, the only black child in the school? Or did he love this child a bit more than he loved the others? Was he merely protecting young Donald? The film, in my renewed opinion, holds the key.Actually, I know a bit more than the average audience. The actors in the film, as well as the direction of the original play, suggest Father Flynn is innocent and Sister Aloysius is a goofy old bat who has gone nuts. She targets Fr. Flynn as the root of all evil, which is actually a root growing wildly in her own head. And by the way, the play - and the actors here - seem to agree that Fr. Flynn is totally innocent.Here's what we all know: nasty looks shot at Fr. Flynn by certain students (BIG clue, thanks a lot). In fact, the little bastard who smiles at the news that Fr. Flynn is leaving gives us nothing - precisely because he's a little bastard.We know the goofy old nun is checking out the priest, investigating his past. We know she's willing to manually explode her rosary into tiny pieces in her crusade to ""get"" Fr. Flynn and chase him from the school. And we know he has a guilty past, which he declares is in the past for good. What we do not know is what precisely happened, what trouble he caused or why he felt the guilt.Like a very bad mystery, this film reveals little. Nothing but Sr. Aloysius' ""doubts"" - and I still ask myself, ""What?? What does she doubt?"", because we are never told what it is she doubts. I thought she simply began to doubt the very existence of God.My wife thought she was doubting her own faith. Also, I had initially thought she was doubting whether she did the right thing in going after Flynn, except that she was confident, glad and showed no remorse. Now I wonder if she was doubting the goodness of the Church, since Flynn is simply reassigned after all her hard work.There is one undercurrent that occurred to me that is not mentioned: the very real damage the Church has inflicted on its clergy. Both Sr. Aloysius and Fr. Flynn can be called victims. God knows what created a beast like Sr. Aloysius. Wounded animals trying to survive, like the Fathers Flynn, are so well known we pretend we don't see them in that light.Flynn comes into this film with unclean hands, and we are shown plenty of hard evidence of that. This in turn made me wonder whose idea it was to rob him of his original innocence, evident in the play. Hoffman's characterization reminded me of the infamous Father Murphy, who molested all those deaf boys in Milwaukee. So maybe the doubt is whether or how long the Chruch will last being run by aiders and abettors.UPDATE, FEBRUARY 2013: The announcement of the upcoming abdication of Pope Benedict XVI, plus a stunning documentary about the Catholic Church's worldwide pedophile scandal, set me to rethinking this film. After all, a crime against humanity is a crime against humanity.This film's facts ultimately must be in the eyes of the beholder. However, I think sadly enough there's concrete condemnation of Flynn here. He gives off all the signs, all the red flags go up and the crazy old nun doesn't seem quite so crazy in light of this. After all, Sister Aloysius makes a few startling discoveries about Father Flynn during her discreetly placed phone calls.Flynn's been shunted to the school - at the end he is shunted elsewhere and that speaks volumes. So I see a more profound message in this film than I ever realized up til now: it is a warning, an early-warning story if you like, about the building storm that was already very old at the time in which this film is set. The crazy old nun was fighting for her church, a church she pictured as disappearing in the near future.She was right.If you want to know all about the real-life problems, I highly recommend the bookThe Case of the Pope: Vatican Accountability for Human Rights Abuseby Judge Geoffrey Robertson QC, human rights attorney and Queen's Counsel.",N/A
1147957,"The first thing to say is that this is more of a docudrama than a film.  The second thing is that it is based on real life events that happened in the small town of Aramoana, New Zealand, in November of 1990.On 13 November 1990 David Gray (Matthew Sunderland) picked up his weapons and, walking around the small costal community shot everyone he could see - men, women and children.  For 22 hours he terrorised the local area.  Why he did this no one will ever know as he was eventually shot dead by the police.  The reason suggested by the film maker is a form of paranoid schizophrenia, with the final breakdown starting with problems at the bank and culminating with him chasing a child of ""his land"".  He first picked up his rifle when the child's father approached the house to find out what the problem was - he was the first to die.By the end of his rampage he had murdered 13 people (from the age of 5 to 70) and wounded many others.  Nine police officers received awards and commendations.  Sergeant Stewart Guthrie (William Kircher) received a posthumous George Cross.  Mrs Helen Dickson (Lois Lawn), aged 73, received the George Medal for ""great bravery"".  Mrs Dickson (who had undergone hip replacement surgery and walked with sticks) repeatedly crawled back and forth to a wounded neighbour and to the phone to call for help.Nick Harvey (Karl Urban) was one of the local policemen and most of what happens after the rampage is seen from his point of view, though several incidents which occurred to a number of different officers have been amalgamated into this one persons view for ease of movie making.  Nevertheless, it is amazing and horrifying to think that anyone could have lived though a single one of these events.  Urban (to his credit) plays Officer Harvey as the ordinary family man who is forced into a situation which he doesn't want be in (just as he was in real life).  Thankfully, the actor and film makers were resistant to the usual Hollywood influence to make him larger than life.The cast and crew interviews are telling:  Karl Urban is obviously affected by what had happened and the enactment.Other extras include audio commentary, two featurettes (""Tragedy"" and ""Honouring Aramoana""), cast and crew interviews, and original news footage.I watched the film first and then the commentary which includes Aramoana police officer Billl O'Brien (the writer of the book the film is based on), who had interviews with the survivors) from Aramoana who was involved in the hunt for Gray and the rescue of the injured - and it is this that has more impact than the film itself.  It is something I would like to be able to play for my students.This film was made with a great deal of respect for the people and events it portrays, no big budget flashy scenes, no wise-cracks, no romanticising - just a straight telling of the survivors stories - which may be why this amazing film never received the acknowledgement it should have.",Out of the Blue

1213734,"Documentaries are a very special branch of the art of cinema. It's purpose can range from entertainment to instruction usually based on some true events or controversial subject. The documentary can put you in the middle of history or show you the lives of regular people that otherwise you would never be aware of. The genre grew out of the old theatrical newsreels. Back in the day long before television took hold of almost every home in the country the people would go to the movie houses and stay for the entire evening. During that time you would get to watch a feature film, a secondary flick, a few cartoons and a newsreel. This was the way that facts and opinions were expressed and lead directly to a lengthier version that we call the documentary. Now it is one of the only genre to get its own category in many award shows including the much lauded Academy Awards; the genre is that special and different. Over time the documentary would take on many varied forms. Some documentary film makers keep a distance from their subject. Others insert themselves directly in the action. It may seem that the format has become routine and some may say even hackney but there is hope in the horizon. Independent film maker Tim Alexander has come up with an extremely fresh and novel approach to this type of film with his work `Diary of a Tired Black Man'. He uses professional actors to play out a situation to invoke an emotional response in his audience. Many documentaries have used actors for reenactments of scenes that occurred in history but this movie combines the documentary with the comedy drama with stunning results. The uniqueness of this film does not stop with its construction and presentation. The marketing involved a model that will certainly become heavily used as time goes on. A three minute clip was posted on the internet and soon made its way around the world. This served to tease the viewers and greatly increase the anticipation for the fill film. The film had some showings in various Indy film festivals but its wide release will be through its DVD premiere handled by Magnolia Home Entertainment. They have always managed to locate the little gems out there in the independent film world and bring them into the house of movie buffs everywhere.This is the first film for Tim Alexander and like many new film makers has taken on more than one hat for the production. He is a true renaissance man capable of handing just about every job function needed in a film crew. It is not unusual for one person to take on writing, direction and production but that is only the tip of the iceberg for Alexander. He wrote the musical score, designed the sets, handled the makeup, wardrobe and worked the camera. It isn't mentioned in the credits but I would be surprised if he also cooked and served at the craft service table. To say this was an ambitious undertaking for Alexander would be a gross underestimation and disservice to the man. What is most amazing is this was his initial foray into all these jobs. If you looked at his resume with all these jobs on a single film you most likely wouldn't believe it at all. The most incredible thing is the fact that Alexander wildly succeeds in each of these functions; he is a one man film school. Needless to say this movie is a work of love for him. This is something that jumps off the screen and pulls the audience in; the sheer love for cinema that Alexander possesses. He certainly had help with crafting this film but this is completely his project.As the title of the film lets on this movie focuses on relationships in the African American community. While the viewpoints are specific to this portion of our society the issues at the heart of the film are universal in nature. No matter what ethnic group you happen to belong to themes such as passion, love, hate and revenge are part of your emotional makeup. The movie examines the difficulty between black men and women in maintaining a relationship. It does touch on some of the unique and very specific circumstances, history and obstacles that face the African Americans but can be translated to one degree or another to anyone. It treads the fine line between being so general as to lose its impact and being overly critical of a single group. This is a raw and at times an emotionally draining film to watch. There is purity to the way the actors let loose on each other that are captivating even if painful at times to view. Alexander certainly knew that he was going to stir up a hornet's nest with the release of this movie. Members of the black community are sure to be divided with what they take away from viewing this film. The part of the focus that is less universal in the most important to the production in many ways. Alexander wanted to expose the effects of tradition, media expectation and prejudice on the black relationship. While all groups have their own variations and will be able to use that to appreciate the film it is targeted and acts as magnifying glass to bring all the harsh details to light. It is this juxtaposition of the highly specific to the general that makes this a brilliant work.The film stars Jimmy Jean-Louis who plays the mind bending superhero Haitian on the NBC television series `Heroes'. Here he portrays James, a black man who is just trying to navigate the murky waters of relationships. The first shot of him is James sitting back having a cup of coffee as he reads an entry from the titular diary. In the time in point he went to pick up his daughter from the home of his ex-wife, Tanya (Paula Lema). Also there, however, were Tanya's three friends. The big mistake that James made in the eyes of his ex and her friends was to show up with a white woman. This is shown in the three minute clip presented here window box for effect. As Tanya meets James at the door the attack immediately escalates. She is resentful not only that he dare to bring another woman to pick up his daughter but the fact that she is white is too much. Tanya taunts him saying that he couldn't find a black woman who would lay back ad let him walk all over her. James does try to keep his composure throughout the heated exchange as the friends begin to chime in with their own sharp barbs. James does point out a bit of possible hypocrisy since one of Tanya's friends is dating a white man. They twist that around on James in short order.The film stays true to the documentary style throughout. It is gritty and realistic with a power to it that is amazing. Some may argue that this is just another drama but it is far more. It is a documentary in the sense that it takes a real situation and presents it through the perception of the film maker. While the characters may be portrayed by actors and extremely talented ones at that, there is a reality here that is rarely if ever caught in a standard film. This is an important piece of cinema and one that should not be missed.",Diary of a Tired Black Man

282439,"The strengths of this Nutcracker can be summed up very simply: the dancing of Baryshnikov and Kirkland, which is to no one's surprise excellent and engaging. And there is some fine dancing from other members of the American Ballet Theater.However, if you're looking for a Nutcracker that will cause you to revel in the holidays as well as Tchaikovsky's glorious music, this isn't it.The sets by Boris Aronson range from a very ordinary parlor for Act 1 to a downright ugly fantasy candyland for Act 2. The costuming is second rate. The Chinese dancers don't look Chinese; the Russians don't look Russian. Other costuming seems cheap and uninspired. The general filming is too soft focus with not enough color contrast. And who's idea was it to have the ugly Act 2 thrones downstage blocking the action?From a choreographic standpoint, this is also a disappointing production.The children in Act 1 don't have much fun dancing and there are not enough of them. The adults don't act particularly well. It seems corners were cut in a lot of the dances in Act 2 which seem under populated and lacking in imagination and fire. You'd think the Russian dance in a Baryshnikov production would set your TV on fire; it is so tame and forgetable here. The Arabian dance is sadly missing altogether!The idea of having Drosselmeyer appear in the climactic Act 2pas de deux is a major distraction. He's simply out of place and adds no joy to the procedings. I'm sure this was meant as some deep psychological addition to the procedings, but it simply kills the moment and has nothing to do with the sublime music. And Act 2, which should end on a magical note, seems downright despressing in this production as Kirkland gazes out of a window like a lost soul???If you want to revel in Nutcracker as a holiday treat, you must turn to the glorious Balanchine version with the NYC Ballet (on DVD) which has Christmas and joy written all over it. Sumptuosly designed, filmed and cast, it should be your first choice. The ABT version can only serve a supplementary version for a serious collection.",The Nutcracker The American Ballet Theatre  VHS
104621,"With a title like ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"", my initial impression was that this was going to be one of those over-the-top horror features that are quite characteristic of Hammer Films Productions. That opinion was soon revised after watching this movie, a perfect blend of drama, suspense, and great acting, especially by the talented Peter Cushing (one of my all-time favorite actors in the horror genre). Here, Cushing portrays the manic-obsessive Baron Frankenstein who flees from a scene of horror, only to visit his evil upon a pair of hapless lovers, a young doctor (Simon Ward) at an insane asylum, and his fiancee (Veronica Carlson), who makes the unfortunate decision of renting a room in her boarding house to Frankenstein. The pair are soon blackmailed to aid the nefarious Baron in his illicit activities, whilst the authorities try to track him down.There are many chilling scenes in this movie - memorable ones such as the scene of a petty thief breaking into Frankenstein's lab, only to find himself facing a scene of indescribable horror and in mortal danger. There is also, disturbingly, a scene of assault in this movie involving a female character and the Baron, which I was quite taken aback by (definitely not a typical role for Cushing who always seems gentlemanly even when portraying 'monsters').All in all, this is a well-made, atmospheric horror movie starring the great Peter Cushing in a monstrously evil role. A must-have for fans of classic horror.",Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed VHS
54881,"Al Pacino has always and will always be one of the best actors in Hollywood. Of all his films though, I strongly believe that this is his best performance...he actually convinced me he was a Cuban refugee. As well Brian De Palma directs beautifully this film, which is in fact written by acclaimed Director Oliver Stone. All of these elements make this film a complete winner for all time.In Scarface we have Tony Montana (Al Pacino) he has recently arrived from Cuba through the Mariel. By the way the film takes place in the 80's, during the time of The ""Marielitos"". Around 125,000 Cubans left the harbor Mariel and went to the United States in what is known as the Mariel boatlift. Immediately in the opening we are told the nature of the film, so don't worry, you will not be confused. After the opening credits we are introduced to Tony, a Cuban refugee, nothing to loose and nothing to offer. Shortly in the movie he begins to mange illegal Drug business. First he transports it, and then he goes higher and works for the ""big boss"".I wouldn't want to ruin the entire movie, it has alot to offer. Interestingly enough is that the movie isn't complex at all, it's very straight forward. What makes the movie triumphant is the way it is directed and shot, not to mention Pacino's remarkable performance. All of those factors made this film a winner.  I'm still surprised that Pacino never won an award for this..Instead he won it only for ""Scent of a Woman"" Have still yet to see it, but I doubt it's better than this one.The majority, even if they have never seen this movie, know the famous phrase ""Say Hello to My Little Friend"". Both the phrase and the entire scene demonstrated how well of an actor Pacino is. As well the scene exemplifies the nature of the drug world. The score of the film is another great factor in the movie, especially in the last shot.If you are planning to get this movie, I suggest you get the Platinum 2 disc Edition; it brings dozens of extras and presents the film for the first time digitally Re-mastered in a High Definition Transfer, with Re-mixed audio in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound.

1008841,"Robert Mitchum's loner cool, Jane Russell's breasts and Howard Hughes' obsessiveness might be all there are to this odd, dull noir, but then there's Vincent Price. He plays, as if born to the part, a ham of an actor who befriends Mitchum when Mitchum could really use some help. With Vincent Price deliberately overacting, Hughes and His Kind of Woman got lucky, turning a disaster into simply an oddity.But that's not saying much. What Hughes came up with after taking the movie away from director John Farrow is a mishmash of poor craftsmanship and the forced joining of some decent noir scenes with low quality comedy. Hughes winds up with Mitchum and Russell in a Mexican resort, not a bad thing at all, but also with Raymond's Burr's bulging eyeballs and psycho brutality, a hypodermic filled with nasty Nazi fluid, a sinking rowboat filled with ""comically"" inept Mexican police officers, a facial transplant in the works, Tim Holt as a Fed agent, gravel-voiced Charles McGraw as a gunzel, Price hamming it up and Russell singing something titled ""Five Little Miles from San Berdoo."" The movie starts promisingly, loses its way for well over an hour and then ends with viciousness and belly laughs. His Kind of Woman is a movie almost as odd as Howard Hughes was.What's the story? Dan Milner (Robert Mitchum), a loner down on his luck, stops at a diner late one night for a glass of milk he can't pay for, then meanders down the street to his rented room. He's met by three thugs who beat him up. Then he gets offered money if he flies down to a small resort on the Mexican coast to await further orders. He'll be part of a scheme involving a deported top gangster, Nick Farraro (Raymond Burr), who needs a new identity to return to the States. Dan shrugs and goes. On the way he meets Lenore Brent (Jane Russell), a singer who is determined to marry rich. She's headed to the same resort to hook up with Mark Cardigan (Vincent Price), famous Hollywood adventure star, who is down there for a spot of shooting and relaxation while his wife gets a divorce.The ennui sets in when Dan and Lenore get settled at the resort. The movie lasts for two long hours, and a good deal of that time is spent getting to know a number of the guests, a good many of whom have nothing much to do with the story line. There's even a young hubby with a gambling problem being taken to the cleaners. Dan steps in and cleverly turns the tables. He gets a chaste kiss by the young wife as thanks as the couple happily leave the resort.Then the movie starts getting serious again with Nick arriving in a yacht. Dan changes his mind and fights back, Lenore gets worried and Mark with his rifles sets out to rescue Dan from the yacht. Price uses all his hammy skills to play the hammy Mark, and he gives Mitchum a run for his money. Unfortunately, we keep cutting back to Mitchum creeping around the yacht, Mitchum being pounded in the stomach, Mitchum being whipped with a belt and Mitchum almost...almost...but not quite...being injected by a white-haired medical war criminal with a serum which will erase Dan's memory, destroy his brain within a year, and keep his face intact until it can be used by Nick the psycho gangster. The movie takes this seriously. Then add Mark playing slapstick hero. What on earth was Howard Hughes thinking about?Well, we know he was thinking about Jane Russell and her 38D bust. He makes sure this actress, who he was determined would be a big star, is photographed with loving skill. As for Russell, the movie is so schizoid she's hardly given a chance to show what she can do. She has two songs, neither of them very good. What she does well is to project her natural good humor. She's sexy in the standard Hollywood style, but she never seems to really take herself too seriously. She works well with Mitchum, who manages to hold his own simply because his laid-back, tough style never really depended on the movies he was cast in.His Kind of Woman isn't much of a noir, although it starts promisingly. It's not much of a movie, either, because it mixes so oddly and unconvincingly violence and low comedy. However, Mitchum is always Mitchum, Russell has a fine, honest personality despite the cantilevered bras Hughes designed for her, and Price is a good sport.",N/A

1278013,"I ordered this for my customers who dig this kind ofHostel - The Director's Cut [Blu-ray]-like film depravity, and in this case coupled with the now-common first person video camera feel (ala[Rec],Quarantineand twenty others).The story is all shown through ""obtained"" video camera footage found in an abandoned southern California institution. Footage purportedly from/by a victim's camera - one of many tortured ladies at the hands of a mutilation-prone physician (injuring both himself and many others). The premise of this is reportedly based upon the story/circumstances of the real Graeme Reeves, even inclusive of a text-ending stating how he has still escaped prosecution and has not been caught (in reality he is in prison awaiting trial overseas). Putting aside the film has really nothing to do with the guy, you get a well-acted low-budget take on this popular genre. Rooker is outstanding, though he only gets a few scenes. The torture scenes are tough, and if this were rated I am sure it would be in the NC-17 range. A musical score was added to further the impossibility of how certain scenes could be filmed or how this cut was edited, but if you skip the analysis of logistics and watch the performances you will get more out of it.Supplements are lengthy and include:* Three alternate endings. They average 1:20-1:30 each and vary in the level of information they text about the doctor, the level of genital mutilations upon women in the world, or a ""twist"" ending that furthered the ""how could this be being filmed"" notion.* Five deleted scenes totaling 18:30 minutes. Glad they cut them, but a lot of Munro's stuff got cut (I remember most as the agent fromWhite Chicks (Unrated and Uncut Edition)).* How to Strip, 2:50 minutes of the two main gals learning to work their scenes.* Cast interviews in character, 12:50 minutes. Obviously they were going for the authentic feel here in trying to convince us (and themselves) about how important character was.* Behind the Scenes, 23:39 minutes. A somewhat thorough look into the making of and logistics.* Anatomy of a Scene, 13:53. A dry retelling and rehearsal behind doing one of the single-take shots in the film - I would have actually preferred they do any of the other one-takes they did than the one they show here.* Director Interview, 18:55 minutes. Have to give them props for actually using good backgrounds for the interviews (hate the boring backdrops or dull stages). He talked while outdoors (even sitting in a tree) - unique.* Location Scout, 4:38 minutes. Camera follows the crew as they scope out the main building, dry.Overall, there was obviously a great deal put into this with the budget they were allowed - so the end result succeeds in being disgusting and containing good performances - but the whole believability issue is gone. And as stated, go into this not expecting it to have any tangible connection to the real guy. 3 stars for the film, 1 star for the extra features.",N/A
1316162,"Without a doubt, Hawaii Five-0 was one of the top 10 television shows that was ever produced for all-time. They certainly don't make TV shows like that any more. The quality of the previous 7 Seasons of Five-0 was always great, and I would certainly expect that Season 8 will follow in the same tradition. However, even if they produced it in Black and White, I'd still give it 5 STARS.  By the time Season 8 had rolled around in 1975, some of the plots were not quite up to par like they were in some of the earlier Seasons, but I still love watching every one of them. A few years ago I previously purchased all 12 Seasons of Five-0 which were mainly just old copies that were probably made directly from TV broadcasts, which even included the commercials.

221843,"John Schlesinger's THE DAY OF THE LOCUST impeccably recreates the sleaziest elements of 1930s Hollywood. In this world, dreams are dashed simply because they're -meant- to be destroyed, and happy endings don't even exist in the movies.All primary actors (plus many of the film's minors) turn in excellent portrayals, and yet this one can be a mixed bag.The rather unusual-looking Karen Black is at her best here. Donald Sutherland's Homer Simpson is a tragic, unforgettable character.

The instructions are simple yet effective with easy-to-understand demonstrations.  Once you understand the demonstrations and instructions you will not need to refer to them again, unless you forget them.  The menu is also conveniently structured so that you can refer to the instructions and demos then make your adjustments by choosing the corresponding menu options once the instructions are finished.There are a few topics that are missing (minor).  One is coverage on scan velocity modulation.  On some sets this is a switchable feature that should be turned off to defeat a set's artificial edge sharpening circuitry.  If it is possible to switch this feature off it may actually make the Sharpness/Detail adjustment easier to make by reducing any chance of ghost images on the contours of objects.Other users may also notice that there is no coverage on the advantages of component or HDMI video connections nor any coverage on upscaling or de-interlacing signals for modern flat panel TVs.

1106697,"Some movies are truly transformational, with an impact on not only film but often culture in general.  For example, Star Wars not only changed movies by adding emphasis to special effects, but also helped changed the studio philosophies to one of pursuing blockbusters and more generally, pushed science fiction more towards the mainstream.  Die Hard may not have had the same impact, but it definitely had an effect on the action movie.  After all, after Die Hard, there was Under Siege (Die Hard on a battleship), Under Siege 2 (Die Hard on a train), Passenger 57 (Die Hard on an airplane) and Speed 2 (Die Hard on a cruise ship).  As is typically the case, it's best to stick with the original movie and its sequels, all in the Die Hard Ultimate Collection.The original Die Hard is, as would be expected, the best in the bunch.  The plot focuses on the siege of an office building by some supposed terrorists.  As is typical in the Die Hard movies, any political motives are mere cover for getting money, in this case, hundreds of millions of dollars in bearer bonds.  The bad guys are led by Alan Rickman in a role that is one of the top villain roles ever.  Bruce Willis, playing cop John McClane, is the man accidentally in the right place in the right time, leading to a cat-and-mouse game with the crooks.With sequels, the stakes have to be raised, and in Die Hard 2:,Die Harder, the bad guys have taken over an entire airport on a stormy Christmas Eve.  With a number of planes at risk unable to land, the villains are able to hold hundreds hostage to force the accomplishment of  their goal of freeing a notorious (and wealthy) drug lord.  McClane stumbles upon their scheme and leads the effort to stop them.Die Hard with a Vengeance has bombers threatening New York, with Jeremy Irons leading them.  He plays the brother of Hans Gruber, Rickman's character from the first movie, who leads McClane through a series of dangerous games to distract the NYPD from their actual goal involving the gold in the Federal Reserve.  Although still good, it is my least favorite of the four movies:  Irons may have an Oscar but his villainy pales compared to Rickman's, and Samuel Jackson plays his standard angry-guy role.  Released in 1995, this film does have a certain extra layer of irony after 9/11 with its bombings.Live Free or Die Hard has Tim Olyphant as a computer genius who has hacked into major infrastructure systems and is throwing the country into chaos.  McClane isn't much with computers, but his old-school ways (that is, shoot-em-up) will prove to be quite the match.  Justin Long plays a hacker who is an inadvertent accomplice and then is targeted for assassination.While none of these movies are the sort to win Oscars, they are all loud, turn-off-your-brain action-filled roller coaster rides,  Besides the movies, there are heaps of extras (each movie is a two disc set) including commentaries and ""making-of"" features.  If you're a fan of action movies, this Die Hard boxed set should be part of your DVD collection.",N/A

Most of the good stuff is on the first 3discs that make up the mass market version, but, this is what you miss:  the Dave Clark 5 tribute ""Glad All Over"" with Joan Jett, John Mellencamp,John Fogerty and Billy Joel.  Ruth Brown with Bonnie Raitt.  You have tobe old like me to know Ruth Brown but she was in great voice andout sung many younger singers in this collection.  The Staple Singers  with all of its members.  Pops Staples so old just glad to be there.  ""Who'll Stop The Rain"" John Fogerty.  The Pretenders three song set with  Neil Young playing lead on ""My City Was Gone.""  The last disc is the live  stadium concert which was surprisingly good but way too short at 52minutes.  Biggest surprise (other than Ruth Brown) was Bon Jovi andEric Burdon doing ""It's My Life/We Gotta Get Out Of This Place.""  Burdon  looked and sang great.  Coolest guitars:  Jack Bruce's fretless bass and  Chrissie Hynde's metallic Telecaster.  Like I said, the best stuff is on the  first 3 discs.  Crosby, Stills & Nash were the best I've seen in years.  Pete Townshed's induction of the Rolling Stones is hilarious.Biggest complaint:  They cut out the funniest moments from Springsteen's  induction of U2, which I saw live and was the best speech ever if you got  to hear the whole thing.  The 9 disc set is for collectors and worth a hundred  bucks, but no more than that.  Best Buy has an exclusive 4 disc set which  is just the first three plus the stadium concert disc, which is the best deal  money wise.

1270396,"To begin with, I am an old fan of the original Land of the Lost TV series. I am also not a fan of Will Farrell. Yet I was willing to give this thing a chance. I almost wish I hadn't. The best thing I can say about the film is that it was not as bad as the reviews led me to believe. The fact remains that it is still a terrible film in almost every way.The cheesiest thing in the film was how they worked the original lyrics of the opening theme into the script and then later had Will Farrell sing a terrible version of it as if to slam us over the head that this was supposed to be based on a beloved television series. The overly-intelligent dinosaurs were an insult to the intellect of the viewer. The story of the rivalry between Enik and the Zarn seemed artificially grafted into the film instead of being an integral part of it. Personally, I was miffed that they made Enik a megalomaniacal villain (he was originally a neutral character helping the Marshalls for his own selfish but understandable reasons) and the Zarn into the victimized guardian. In fact, they completely changed the nature of the Zarn altogether (originally he was a being made of colored lights who was sensitive to human thought and emotion and was more neutral than evil).The story runs that disgraced physicist Rick Marshall has invented a machine which can open a doorway in time and space. A grad student named Holly convinces him to to build it and they use it to open a portal to the land of the lost, inadvertently taking a tour-guide biker named Will along with them. Once in the Land of the Lost, they rescue Chaka, a Pakuni prince, from being sacrificed by userpers of his throne. Rick Marshall acts superior to everyone and everything in this place, which pisses off Grumpy, the genius T-rex who, for some reason, understands English. We also have no good explanation why working with Chimps has made Holly fluent in Chaka's language. After lots of bad jokes based on the original series, they find the Lost City of the Sleestak. They included the message scrawled on one of the rocks ""beware of Sleestak"" from the original TV show without explaining it properly. They have been led here psychically by Enik who is trapped inside. Enik tells them that his people's mortal enemy, the Zarn, is planning a Sleestak invasion of Earth. Rick must find his device which was lost when they entered the Land of the Lost in order to defeat the Zarn and get home again. It just goes downhill from here. The film ends with Rick Marshall and Holly falling in  love, Rick Marshall making friends with Grumpy, the T-rex (Grumpy was grumpy because of an intestinal blockage. Don't ask how it gets fixed), and Will remaining behind with Chaka and his people. And the invasion, which is really being planned by Enik, is stopped.What really gets me is that the original television series has a number of episodes which could have been strung together and, with a bit of tweaking, become a nice two-hour film: The Marshall family is vacationing in the Grand Canyon when an earthquake accidentally opens a time doorway to the Land of the Lost. They make friends with Chaka who helps them get through the first few weeks of their exile. They discover the Pylons and the Lost City teeming with Sleestaks - and mabe have a run-in with Captain Colli and his canon, Sarah. Deep inside the Lost City they find Enik in his secure cave. He agrees to help them, but it is a trick. By falling into the Land of the Lost, they have caused a paradox. They go through the doorway, fixing the paradox and fall back into the Land of the Lost again. But all is not lost. Chaka takes Rick Marshall to see a special ritual performed by Ta, the Pakuni elder which opens a time dooway in one of the pylons. Rick Marshall steps inside, ignoring Chaka's attempts to stop him. Meanwhile, Holly and Will go out hunting for their dad only to be confronted by a ghostly image of Holly. The Ghost beckons them into a cave where they are forced to help alternate versions of themselves and their father who are stuck in a wall by completing a circuit of crystals in a matrix table. When the smoke clears, they find themselves outside with Chaka running to get them. They follow chaka to the Travelling Pylon just in time for the door to open and Rick Marshall to step out with the news that the pylon is their ticket home. Next morning, they get inside the pylon and the last part of the film includes a series of stops on alternate worlds and times. Finally, they climb out of the pylon in a remote part of the Grand Canyon. An old, wreck of a car leads them to believe that they are in the wrong place until around a corner comes a troup of tourists on the backs of donkeys. I would maybe include Mrs. Rick Marshall as well as a female guide for Will to ogle.The point is that this film should have been a reverent, serious sci-fi epic rather than a cheesy satire which puts down the original source material every chance it could get.Bottom line, I would not recommend this film to anyone. Especially if you are a fan of the original series. Stay away!",N/A

1242882,"The International: 6 out of 10: The International has great timing. Not since The China Syndrome opened up 12 days before the Three Mile Island Accident, has a movie seemed so prescient (Or in The international's case ripped from the headlines.)A therein lies one of The International's two main problems. It is ripped from the headlines. The problem is the headlines in question are from 1989. The movie is about The BCCI collapse. Unfortunately the script mimics the actual late eighties scandal a little to accurately for its own good.There are clues that the script had been collecting dust for some time before the new bank crisis prompted it back in the mix. For example, one of the more famous BCCI clients was Samuel Doe, who was president of Liberia in the early eighties. Not exactly ripped from the headlines stuff, but the International doggedly creates a General Charles Motomba, played gamily by Lucian Msamati, who takes over Liberia with the banks help. Something that makes little sense in a year that starts with a two.In another, what decade is this again moment, the hit man uses a payphone after receiving what appears to be a beeper message. For those under 35, and not 30 Rock fans, let me explain what a beeper was. A beeper was a cell phone that did not make calls. It only received phone numbers. Then you, the recipient of a 'beep', would have to find a payphone and call the number to talk to someone.Now a payphone was a phone that the public would use instead of their own separate cell phones. They were metal and had many germs. If you visit a public transport hub, you can sometimes still find 'banks' of phones.If it seems I am nitpicking, keep in mind the film itself lives in some uncanny valley between Michael Clayton and The Bourne Identity. Not nearly realistic enough for Clayton fans; and for the Bourne fans? Well there are about as many action set pieces as there are hours the film runs. (Read two) It is a surprisingly talky affair.Speaking of talking, 'Sometimes a man can meet his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.' Can someone explain that quote to me. Our rumpled protagonist says it at least twice and it makes no bloody sense either time.In addition, speaking of not making sense' late in the film in Istanbul (not Constantinople) one bad guy says to the other let me show you a something few man have seen and proceeds to take him to the Basilica Cistern. You know that underground canal featured In From Russia with Love and maybe the second Indiana Jones film and is one of Turkey's biggest tourist attractions. This makes about as much sense if he said it about the Statue of Liberty. (There is this statue; in the harbor, few men have seen my friend.)Overall, the acting, direction and cinematography are decent. However the story is dated and the film is simply too stupid to be an intellectual thriller, and too slow for an action movie. It certainly is a passable, if mediocre, timewaster overall.",N/A

354506,"Other reviewers have well-documented the story.  It is more than a historical novel, it is more than a pacifist tale, or an anti-war movie - there are many many levels of engagement to it.  I stumbled upon the movie as part of Turner Classic Movies late Sunday night (or was it early Monday morning?) foreign film slot.  I was awake, and thought I'd see what the film was like.  I was quickly sucked into the story, the visuals, the soundtrack (awesome, haunting), and the characters.  Much is discussed about the central character, but his fellow soldiers, in particular his captain, are also memorable and important to the entire experience of the movie.  I could not tear myself away from the movie.  Some reviewer complained about the movie being slow...  egad, this is not an action movie, but still it had more going on in it from one scene to the next, because it is so incredibly rich in things other than ""action"" - dialogue, characterizations, symbology, philosophical contrasts, incredibly composed visuals, the aural landscape, etc.  It overflows your senses.  Turn the lights off, so it is just you and the movie, and let it take over.

After pretty weak reviews for Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes this installment has seemed to add a little hope that they can still pump out something decent in the series. It appears the producers decided to keep the revenge slayings to a maximum to keep viewers from falling asleep half way through. This one was bloody for sure, hence the title Blood Feud.The story starts with the well known intense feud between the Hatfields and McCoys. Jodie Hatfield and Ricky McCoy are the only two between the families that have put rivalries behind due to their love for each other. With no end in sight they decide leave town so they can enjoy their relationship without the constant family feuding (not the game show type). So late one night after the Hatfields crashed a McCoy wedding Jodie sneaks away with Ricky while his sister Sara keeps a look out. Despite their efforts they are found in the woods by Jodie's brothers and Sara winds up being killed. Ricky being enraged consults the witch and summons Pumpkinhead who wastes no time ripping people apart. The fury is unleashed on the Hatfields in one non stop bloody mess.As we've seen our fourth appearance of Pumpkinhead it is now evident we will see much more CGI and much less of the true creature himself. Hey things change overtime so you just roll with it. None the less the film is really fun and entertaining. It's by far the best sci-fi channel original they've put out yet to date. Like in other reviews I've done for the series I can only recommend this to the Pumpkinhead fans.

If you can make it past the first half hour you'll probably finish it as it does manage to keep your interest in spite of the fact that it's cliched and formulaic to the hilt.  The 'Harrison Ford just back from Star Wars' factor will be enough for most people.  If you don't take it too seriously (and beleive me, you won't) it almost has a campy kind of entertainment value, i.e. you'll be laughing when the characters are speaking serious lines (see title of this essay).  In spite of that, it won't be the worst way you ever killed two hours.  The action sequences manage to generate a bit of suspense even though things are a bit too tidy and convenient for there to be any trace of beleivablity.

Weaver is particularly effective as the film plays on viewer's emotions and for a good period of time, one doesn't know at all who's to blame and who deserves pity.There's not much in the way of directorial touches that scream out POLANSKI, but as in ""Repulsion"", he milks the isolated setting for all it's worth.",Death & The Maiden VHS

He matches wits with Michelle Ryan, who would clearly make an excellent companion and foil for Mr. Tennant if he were continuing on.

407132,"The life of a teenage girl can be stressful enough, but Momiji Fujimiya is a bit more stressed than usual -- it turns out that evil plant monsters are out to get her. Yes, evil plant monsters.Fortunately if you can swallow that, most of the rest of this series will be a pretty entertaining ride. While it starts rather shakily (and with a very patchy dub), ""Blue Seed: Complete Collection"" unwinds into a complex anime full of grotesque monsters, teen romance, blam-blam action and international strife as the whole world is threatene, et cetera et cetera. It's fluffy fun, but what sets it apart is a heavy dose of Japanese folklore.One day on the way to school, Momiji Fujimiya is confronted by two bizarre creatures -- a young man (Kusanagi) with seven ""blue seed"" mitamas embedded in his body, who tries to kill her; and a serpentine plant monster (Orochi). Turns out she's part of an ancient family line, the Kushinada, that can destroy the aragami (sort of plant monsters).But then Orochi invades Momiji's high school to destroy her, and is barely stopped by the Terrestrial Administration Center (a motley band of scientists, soldiers and government officials). Before Momiji knows it, she's been handed over to Mr. Kunikida of the TAC, and Kusanagi has changed his mind about killing her -- now he wants to protect her, no matter what. Oh yeah, and the Kushinada before her was a twin sister named Kaede, now presumed dead.And life with the TAC is rarely boring: they fight a bizarre jellyfish, a giant water blob, a grotesque crow, a tree aragami at an idol show (where Momiji song-duels with an American Shinto priestess), mutated dogs, a fire-breathing frog, a building-sized centipede, and a bloodsucking creature that can control people. Then a new trio of enemies appear -- a treacherous Kushinada thought to be dead, a sinister man with eight mitama, and the reborn god Susano-o. As the aragami grow in power and number, Momiji becomes plagued with doubts... and the fear that she will lose everything.""Blue Seed: Complete Collection"" starts off a little wobbly. Initially the stories are geared towards fighting the aragami-of-the-week, and a some episodes are just ridiculous -- a couple of them actually hinge on a pop idol competition and PANTY-PREDICTION software. Seriously. But the series starts to flower when it returns to the roots of Japanese folklore and legend, complete with kappa, an immortal woman, and a reborn god.Additionally, as the story becomes more complex and darker, it also brings in an overarcing storyline that stretches all the way to the end. But the writers also keep the main storyline saturated with lighter fare, to remind us that these are people with ordinary lives to live -- a cute little romance between Momiji and Kusanagi, and some fun glimpses at how the various TAC members act around one another. And of course, plenty of explosions, gunfire and messy splattery action scenes.In the first three episodes, Momiji is as endearing as a cat ice-skating on a blackboard -- she whines almost continuously. Fortunately she becomes a far more likable heroine as the series goes on, grappling with insecurities and worries that seem all too realistic. Kusanagi is a likable counterpart for Momiji: strong, powerful, but still relaxed enough to tease her about her underwear whenever he gets a chance. Of course he's also utterly socially inept, which makes their budding romance a bit more difficult.And unlike many an anime show, the supporting cast is pretty colourful, even if they sometimes come across as stereotypes (the Genius Loser-Nerd, the Gung-Ho Gun Girl, the Scientist immersed in her work, etc). Fortunately each character is explored lovingly and given their own quirks and weaknesses, making them seem quite real and endearing.It's worth noting that the English dub for this series isn't of great quality. In fact at the start of the series, it's pretty awful -- Momiji's whine, Kusanagi's toneless yells, and Matsudaira's scratchiness. Fortunately the voice actors get the hang of it a few episodes in, and they're doing a pretty decent job by the middle of the series.""Blue Seed: Complete Collection"" starts off wobbly in many ways, but it also serves up plenty of monsters, mayhem, and Japanese folklore.

The prostitutes are easy to persuade, with low self-esteem, lost souls, lonely, as prostitution is not about the sex and love.

747810,"One of those movies that has grown (a significant amount I should say) on me over time, `Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is probably, in my personal opinion, the greatest swashbuckling sea adventure film ever filmed.  Now, when I walked out of the theater the first time I saw this I didn't feel that way.I was supper hyped about seeing this (you think I worship Peter Sarsgaard, you should see the shrine I have in my bedroom dedicated to thy Holy Crowe) and so I was there opening night with all this built up enthusiasm and wound up nearly falling asleep and completely giving into my friends constant griping and concluded that this was a dud of a film.  Problem was, I already promised my father that I would see it with him the next day and so I braced myself for boredom (although I do enjoying watching Crowe do anything).  Get this; there in the middle of the day I watched this film through new eyes.I absolutely loved it.Now I was already going to buy the film regardless of my feelings (like I said, WORSHIP) but now I had a new outlook and was highly anticipating the DVD release.  While the film is glorious (I've seen it nearly twenty times and am strongly considering watching it this evening...the wife is away for the weekend which always turns into an excuse for me to eat pizza, drink beer and watch every Russell Crowe movie I own...which is all of them) I have to give a major shout-out to the extras here, because this DVD is packed with them and they are all amazing.  This should be noteworthy coming from me, because if you follow my reviews then you know that I never discuss extras because to me the review is all about the content of the film, not the DVD, but these are just too good to ignore.  I don't generally watch the extras but I've seen these a few times and find them thoroughly engaging.Back to the film.I think my issue with the film upon first viewing was that I was expecting something totally different.  I was under the impression that the last fifteen minutes here (briskly paced, non-stop action) was the entire film.  It is not.  It is the last fifteen minutes.  Now, as we all know, I love slow brooding character studies; but not at midnight (yes, I went to the midnight showing).  That was a huge mistake, although had it been a high speed adrenaline rush I don't think it would have been.So, like I said, the biggest issue was that I was expecting something else entirely.Upon subsequent viewings (many, as you can tell), I've come to appreciate this film as so much more than just your average high seas tale.  There is a beautiful honesty about its portrayal of sea life that makes me quiver in appreciation, but there is also a genuine sense of comradeship that really becomes the basis for the film in my opinion.  The chemistry between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany is utterly fantastic and it really makes this a simmering beauty of a film.  There is a natural elegance with the way Crowe portrays Jack Aubrey's feelings towards his crew, and the awkwardness with which he tells a joke (much like a grandfather at a dinner party, unsure of others reactions but sure in his own `need' to tell it) is completely endearing.  Just witness the way he allows his character to seep into his delivery, making every word seem so natural and almost expected (""Name a shrub after me; something prickly and hard to eradicate."")  Matching him every step of the way is Bettany who completely soaks his character Stephen in a rich loyalty and constant admiration.  Even when Jack displeases Stephen you can tell he is only displeased because he knows in his heart that Jack can do better.  He believes in him that strongly.  Both performances are utterly stunning and completely deserving of any and all praise.The fact that both were snubbed of Oscar nominations is disgusting, especially when those hammy `Mystic River' men took home the gold.Peter Weir is in top form here, creating such an authentic look at naval life.  I love the way that the creaks from the wood on the boat can be heard in every frame.  There is not a single false note here.  It's remarkable to tell you the truth; totally and completely remarkable.So, knowing what you are in for will surely heighten your appreciation for this modern masterpiece.  It is the best of a genre and more than that, the best in the world that is cinema.  It fleshes out not just the two men who form the focus of the film, but it fleshes out the world that is sea life; the ship itself becoming a major player in this film.",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
1233412,"I am a big fan of the Mary Tyler Moore Show. In fact, it is my favorite of all television shows.  I loved everything about the show; the cast (clearly the best ever assembled on one sitcom), the storylines, and the theme song. I not only liked the opening credits, but I also loved the closing credits. I thought it was a very unique way to end the show, by showing episode clips of each cast member along with an instrumental reprisal of the theme song. My favorite characters are Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and Lou Grant (Edward Asner). I have always admired Mary's beauty, sophistication, grace, and charm.  She was also very funny. I believe Mary Tyler Moore's association with Dick Van Dyke on her previous series naturally helped her grow into a great comedic actress on her series. Ed Asner is a wonderful actor. I liked Lou's rough and readiness. A real no holds-barred, meat and potatoes kind of guy. The two of them together (Mary's sweetness and Lou's jagged approach) produced some of the most memorable scenes in television history. Lastly, my favorite show was from season 5, The episode was entitled, ""The System."" This was the episode where Lou, Murray, and Ted were betting on (and winning) NFL games by using Ted's betting system.  However, their fortunes would come to an abrupt end on Super Sunday.Maybe FOX could have handled all releases of MTM better. I was one of the consumers who wrote to FOX originally after they pulled the plug on the MTM after the season 1 release.  But today, I have to praise FOX for now releasing the entire MTM series because for a long time I thought this day would not come. I was one of those MTM fans who bought seasons 1-4 and then waited impatiently for the last three seasons to be released. However, when the announcement was made that FOX was releasing the final three seasons together in a complete series package along with the previously released seasons 1-4, frustration turned into jubilation. Season 1 was released in September 2002. Thus, I am more than willing to spend the extra money to get the complete series in May 2009 and be done with it.  At this time, I would like to take what's available. I don't want to wait around to see if FOX plans to release seasons 5, 6, and 7 individually. I may not outlive that. Sure, FOX's decision to release the complete series now is a money making ploy, but at the same time, I see it as a recognition by them that MTM was indeed one of the greatest TV series ever created and produced.Congratulations Mary Richards!!! Go ahead, toss your hat in the middle of a busy Minneapolis street. Love is all around no need to waste it. You made it after all and May 5, 2009 is graduation day.  Thanks again FOX...Tom",N/A

As I recall the film was limited release.  Like Another State of Mind film had to search it out at limited theatre showings.  Very satisfying.  All the punk rock we could chew.  I liked X and Black Flag of course and Fear and the Germs.  The rest were tag alongs for me but all the real thing and the sorta film that you can only wish more were done like it, telling the story just as it was, with little interviews w/ punx in the scene.

What an incredibly gifted group of musicians, and what a great performance by the man himself - his voice sounds better than on any CD I have.The video is crystal clear (in near hi-def, 16:9 aspect ratio format), and the thoughtful editing complements the beautiful, intimate setting - no smoke and mirrors, and thankfully no MTV-style rapid-fire changing of camera angles, either. The DVD has Dolby 2, Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1 soundtracks, and both the Dolby and DTS surround tracks are fabulous - this really is one of the top three concerts I own in terms of sound quality.The song selection, likewise, offers a great mix of up-tempo hits with a few excellent blues numbers to vary the pace a little.

1166638,"Having seen Abigail Breslin in her fat suit inLittle Miss Sunshine, I was intrigued to learn that she obtained the main role of Nim Rusoe here. I loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Her tireless upbeat attitude was infectious. And I'm happy to say that's what makes this film bearable. Well ...that and Jodi Foster (Inside Man).The cute factor is exceptionally high, so if you're not into the `cute-and-fuzzies', don't say you haven't been warned. But one must realize the audience this film was targeted at: six to eight year olds.Dancing seals, intelligent pelicans, and near verbal lizards are all present on Nim's Island, making the cute-and-fuzzy barometer tilt far to the right. The story is also exceptionally trite, with hardly any danger or suspense. When Nim's dad Jack Rusoe (Gerard Butler,Beowulf & Grendel) gets `lost at sea', there's really little doubt he'll survive -- especially with the help of Galileo the Pelican.Also, when Alexandra Rover (Foster) is forced to decide between her agoraphobia and saving Nim from a life of possible solitude on an uncharted island, there's no doubt she'll overcome her fears and be forced out into the world (it's also entertaining to see how she experiences life outside of her small apartment where she types away on action-adventure books that Nim loves to read).There's not much point to the story, either. Simply exploring Nim's world is the basis for everything, but it's a fun world and one that kids will enjoy watching. The playful animals and the child-growing-up-in-isolation themes are easy for children to follow, and are things parents won't find upsetting in the slightest.But if you're child likes challenges, or you're an adult looking for escapism, this might not be your best choice.",N/A

1250491,"**You will need a multi-region player to play this DVD**As 50-year old parents of an 18-year Autistic son, the better half and I sat down to watch ""The Black Balloon"" with an open mind. She thought it was honest, true to life and moving - I thought it was brutal, clinically exploitive and deeply hurtful to those of us who actually have to live with - and grow old with - this difficult condition.First up - Autism doesn't sell - so the cover of the DVD slyly tries to pan it off as a teenage love story - when most of movie is dominated by the lead character's Autistic brother whose inappropriate, but unintentional outbursts make life for him, his parents and their family - a living hell.This is an Icon Production - Mel Gibson's company - and I've found his movies bludgeon you over the head in order to extract emotion. If he can't gore it up, he'll hurt it up. As other reviewers have pointed out, the brother's behaviour is wild (rubbing excrement into the carpet, punch outs at home, tantrums in supermarkets) - some of which does happen, but most doesn't.  No experienced parents would take their son to such situations precisely because it will precipitate such behaviour - these film parents are conveniently clueless - and that just doesn't wash. Then there's the horrific cruelty of the Australian school kids and neighbours - again all of it so over the top as to beggar belief.But the worst scene is after a particularly horrific home incident, the special needs brother Charlie (played by Luke Ford) supposedly apologises in sign language to his brother Thomas (played by Rhys Wakefield) - this just wouldn't happen. It is precisely because of Autism that Charlie would never make this cognitive leap - and in the real world - it's in this maddening knowledge - that lies so much hurt for siblings. Your brother doesn't progress - your sister doesn't get any better - and most people - including the authorities - couldn't give a toss. But this is a film - and after all that battering-ram stuff - the makers must offer you some hope...Autism has been used in movies before - and to some good effect; ""Mercury Rising"" with Bruce Willis and most famously Dustin Hoffman as the Savant in ""Rain Man"". But these were simplistic versions of the condition without any of the really nasty self-injurious stuff and effect on the family. ""The Black Balloon"" seems to want to bludgeon you over the head with only the gross stuff- and then somehow arrive at a magical point of tolerance at the end. The real world, however, is slightly different.It's not all grim of course - it isn't. There's a moment of extraordinary tenderness and one of the best 'growing up' sexy scenes I've ever seen. The gorgeous Gemma Ward plays Jackie (legs as long as the M1 motorway and a face the camera adores) who fancies the slightly odd she suspects brave Thomas (constantly defending his brother).  Along with all the other swimmers, they are at a school safety exercise lesson lying down by the poolside; she leans over him in her dripping swimsuit to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as per her instructor. He has his eyes shut - supposedly drowned. She has to apply mouth-to-mouth - up and down - blowing in air. The way the sunlight catches her wet hair - the drops falling on him - the proximity of such loveliness - the lips that nearly touch, but can't because people are watching - it's beautifully done - really ace stuff...Also on the up side is Luke Ford's performance as the Autistic Charlie - his mannerisms are very good and at times uncomfortably accurate - our boy displays some of the same. Erik Thompson and Toni Collette are gripping as the parents trying to cope and keep their family together.I'm not adverse to a difficult watch worth the difficulty, but I found this movie strangely exploitive - and for all the wrong reasons. I'll admit that anything that hurts children - especially special needs children - makes me wince and rage - so perhaps my opinion of the movie simply can't be anything other than biased. My wife thought it was brilliant - finally exposing the pain and difficulty parents of special needs children have to go through. I on the other hand would smash Mel Gibson over the head with a mallet...One review on the DVD box tells us the movie is ""...life-affirming..."" and ""...a sheer delight..."" Balls.Make up your own mind folks. As ever, one man's Heaven is....",The Black Balloon [Region 2]
1199636,"I can think of other excellent comedy duos.  I can think of other musical duos which I really enjoy and put on my ipod.  I can think of other performance artists who do leading edge work which is visually experimental.  I cannot think of any other duo, either currently or in the past, who can do all three and do them all well.  The only act this even sort of reminds of is Martin & Lewis because Dean Martin could sing and their comedy was pretty good for its day.  I wouldn't go so far as to call Martin & Lewis's work performance art though.  Other than Martin & Lewis, I can't think of anyone else like these guys at all.Why are viewers here debating season 1 versus season 2?  This is not remotely like anything else out there and it is so innovative that I can scarcely believe that it survived for a second season.  If it had been on anything but HBO I think it would have been too leading edge and been cancelled after the first season.  I'm not comparing the two; I am in grovel mode that there were two seasons!Ok, here is the premise.  There are two musicians from New Zealand who come to New York City (of all places) to break into the entertainment world as musicians.  Their manager works for the New Zealand Commission in New York City and that job is such a no brainer that he basically can do whatever he wants with his time.  The band has exactly one fan, a woman.  The only reason she is a fan is that she has the hots for Bret.  The guys are poor as can be.  They live together in a subsistence lifestyle.  And they are complete nerds on top of everything else.  At first I liked Bret best because (being a woman), I found him cuter.  But Jemaine has grown on me and I've gotten past his awful glasses and sideburns ('70s style sideburns).  Their manager I find positively uproarious.  Even the fan has her moments.  Very often the guys deliver their lines in complete deadpan, which makes it even funnier.  Oh, and they are more often than not a disaster with women.  They have dates on the show and these dates rival anything we saw on SEINFELD or FRASIER (which heretofore covered dating hell rather definitively).The best part of all is when the guys break out into song and movement, usually in an outrageous MTV kind of music video style, to comment on the latest bizarre aspect of their lives.  Those performances are worth playing again and again.I do listen to the songs on my ipod and I enjoy their music.  I am not alone as their music has been voted on favorably in the NPR yearly music polls.  Bob Bollein of NPR's ALL SONGS CONSIDERED was very taken with their musical numbers without knowing a thing about their tv show. So their music is an important component of the show for me.Funny as Bret and Jemaine are, Rhys Darby as Murray their manager deserves a special mention. He just slays me and I love every minute he is onscreen.  I adore his band meetings, especially when he takes attendance and there is NEVER anyone but the three of them in the room.",N/A
930550,"Several people mentioned they felt the audio quality is not so great. Actually, the audio quality is very, very good. The problem is, the center channel volume was recorded waaaay too low, causing the vocals to sort of get lost in the side channel ambience. If you listen to this DVD through a multi-channel surround sound system, simply use your remote to boost only the center channel volume by 7-10 dB, and the sound stage balance is brought back into perfect harmony. It is then that you realize that the overall audio quality was not the problem. Stereo-only listeners, however, will indeed be let down by the audio. The only downside to boosting the center volume comes between songs, when the announcers are eardrum-shatteringly loud, causing one to have to toggle the volume up and down throughout the DVD.

Sam Rockwell has an abrupt, angry energy, but the script of the movie makes him do too many things, or have too many quirky sides and no actor could incorporate them all with any success.  If he had just been a grifter who pretended to choke when he wanted a patron, that might have been cool.  Or if he had had a cute job as a historical re-enactor at a Williamsburg-style theme attraction, living the Judd Apatow lifestyle with gawky, earnest Zack Galifianakis, that would have been enough for me.But on top of it is the whole sex addict thing and also having Anjelica Huston for a mother,  It's like a broad re-write of Portnoy's Complaint, except told from the inside of a mental hospital.

316976,"When I asked my readers (and my friends and co-workers) which of the Bond Blu-Ray releases I should watch first, they unanimously picked Live and Let Die. Obviously if you've been reading my reviews you know that I ignored them, purely because I didn't want to start off with Roger Moore's first outing as Bond, which is an...odd film, to say the least.With Connery (and Lazenby) gone from the Bond picture, the franchise seemed keen on reinventing itself with Moore and his different take on the secret agent. Rather than the suave styles of Sean, or the gritty gist of George, Roger went with a new direction for the Bond films: humor.Don't get me wrong, Connery had his moments, but largely Connery's remarks were one-liners thrown at just the right time -- not all the time. What goes best with humor? Apparently nonsensical camp and self referencing dialogue! Live and Let Die was Michael Meyer's biggest inspiration for Austin Powers; that should tell you all you need to know.As I already said, the movie was an odd one for an action spy thriller, let alone one like Bond. Live and Let Die is, ultimately, a supernatural Blaxploitation 70s B film which happens to have James Bond as the lead. Without James, the movie would work great and be considered a cult 70s classic; with him, it enters a whole new level of entertaining. This was a side (and type) of Bond never seen before to this extent, and changed the direction of the franchise from a more serious role to what we saw until Casino Royale came out to bring the series back to earth.Ultimately, it's a fun romp and very entertaining. Is it a great movie? No. Is it an entertaining movie? No doubt. It's one of my favorite Bond films not because it breaks ground or has the best story, but because it's the most fun to watch and has one of the most intriguing characters in any Bond film before or since, Baron Samedi. (Plus it has the best Bond theme and opening sequence ever!)Live and Let Die gets a bad wrap with a lot of fans because it doesn't take itself as seriously as Connery's films did, but faulting it for that would be no different than faulting Connery for making Bond too imposing of a figure to take over. No one could replace Connery as James Bond, so instead Roger Moore gave us a new direction for Bond to travel-one where a number of fine actors could replicate his persona on screen, and most importantly, entertain viewers.Like the other older Bond films released on Blu-Ray, the video transfer does nothing astounding but does bring the quality up several notches. Colors are more vibrant, there's less grain and noise, blacks are deeper, and the little things are noticeable for the first time since theaters. It's a great presentation for an older movie, and if you have an HDTV and are a fan of Bond (or fun) it's a must-own not only for the quality of the film itself, but for the quality of the transfer.Sadly, the audio is lacking in this one compared to the other five releases. While it's technically 5.1 and lossless, the levels could have been tweaked better. There were more times during this film that I had to adjust the volume to hear speaking (and lessen effect noise to a tolerable level for neighbors) than any of the other releases. It's a nuisance at most playing Volume Coach, but it's still one a viewer shouldn't have to go through multiple times throughout the film.Once again, the extras on this Blu-Ray release are nothing new and are identical to the extras featured on previous DVD releases of this movie. While a few images here and there have been cleaned up or made in higher quality, for the most part it's exactly the same as if you had your DVD version from four years ago in the Blu-Ray player. A shame, but given that every Blu-Ray in this set is in the same boat (except Die Another Day which features less than the DVD releases) it's nothing surprising and shouldn't deter you from making a purchase.",Live and Let Die VHS

Westerns, long the most popular genre in American film, examine our personal relationship to nature; film noir examines the complexities of modern urban existence and our place in a dangerous and deceptive social milieu, a world that can paradoxically leave us as isolated as the Western loner.  The quintessential archetype of the Western is John Wayne and ""The Searchers""; the same position in film noir is occupied by Bogart and practically any of his films from the 1940s.  Later color films can qualify, providing the colors are muted so completely they play like black and white--prime examples: ""Chinatown"" and Clint Eastwood's underrated ""Tight Rope"").  America's obsession with film noir throughout the 1940s is testimony to a pervasive paranoia or a sophisticated appreciation of film art or both.The stand-outs in the present collection are: 1.  Robert Ryan and the Bernard Herrmann score for ""On Dangerous Ground"" (great title for a work on film noir, a genre that transplants us from the open plains to the shadowy, mysterious streets of the inner city--though surprise!--in this film the country ground is no more stable or peaceful or less ""noirish"" than the dark and treacherous urban pavements.  Ryan, the heavy-weight-boxer-turned actor (in real life) gives another nuanced performance (in reel life); the score could not have been composed by any other than the composer of the music for ""Vertigo"" (splendid movie but too ""operatic"" to qualify as film noir); 2. ""His Kind of Woman"" may be the most multi-layered example of film noir yet.  The fact that Vincent Price doesn't steal the show in what is arguably his best performance is a tribute to the smoldering, sensual power of the ""love dance"" between Mitchum and Russell on screen (after viewing him in this film, I can finally understand his appeal.  That glide--the legs moving without the participation of the torso--is as unique a form of poetic pedestrian choreography as the John Wayne stride).  If all this weren't enough, there's Raymond Burr in one of the most cruel, sadistic, obsessively psychotic roles ever filmed.  But in the end, the film becomes swashbuckling, slapstick farce, equal parts Erroll Flynn, Mack Sennett, and Shakespeare--all of it harmonizing thanks to the charming, forgivably narcissistic theatricalism of Vincent Price.  The film is at once a remarkable example of film noir and a send-up of the entire genre.In a Special Features section included with each film are extended commentaries, often of questionable worth.  On this latter one, the scholar repeats the word ""wonderful"" as often as Caroline Kennedy says ""Y'know"" and attributes Price's Shakespearean quotes to the wrong plays. The violent thriller ""Border Incident,"" while not prototypical film noir, receives perhaps the most insightful, thoughtfully-scripted commentary from an NYU prof, though the political emphasis is often overdone (mustn't allow the slightest stereotyping of Hispanics go unnoticed, even though the filmmakers probably imagine they're pro-Mexican--the kinds of observations that, after awhile, take on a self-congratulatory quality while perhaps the most excruciating death scene ever filmed somehow gets explained away in glib archetypal/political talk.  And why not pay as much attention to George Murphy's idiosyncratic ""look"" and acting on-screen as to his political sympathies off-screen?).  But each includes at least some fascinating trivia and, best of all, they give the viewer an excuse to watch the films a second time. Each flick is well worth it!",N/A

1264028,"""State of Play"", an Americanized version of the hit BBC miniseries, may feel like familiar ground for fans of ""All the President's Men"", ""Three Days of the Condor"", and other thrillers set within the corridors of power, and Kevin Macdonald (the inventive director of ""The Last King of Scotland"") intentionally homaged ""President's Men"" frequently in the film (as both films involved conspiracy, investigative reporters and city newspapers). The references certainly don't hurt the film, although I wish he'd captured the mounting suspense as effectively! While well-crafted, ""State of Play"" never achieves 'edge-of-your-seat' tension, despite a first-rate cast, and clever script.When a rising politician (Ben Affleck), heading a Senate subcommitte investigating a shady military subcontractor, discovers his mistress has died, he loses his composure in front of a national TV audience, and his political future is endangered. Was it an accident, a suicide...or murder? He asks his ex-college roommate, veteran reporter Russell Crowe (who looks about a decade older than Affleck!), to look into it. Hounded by young, up-and-coming reporter Rachel McAdams, Crowe half-heartedly begins to investigate the death...and a much, much larger plot emerges, involving the corporation under investigation, the Senate Majority Leader (Jeff Daniels), possibly Affleck's unhappy wife (and ex-Crowe girlfriend), Robin Wright Penn, and even Affleck, himself. While Crowe's exasperated editor (Helen Mirren) fights him, demanding to go to press with what he has, Crowe refuses to stop, until he knows the truth...making him a target...Washington, D.C. has never been seen to better advantage, and the press room is so accurate, it's difficult to believe it's actually a movie set. Russell Crowe is magnificent, certainly giving the best performance of the film (Affleck, McAdams, and Mirren are also very good). The climactic plot twist, while not entirely a surprise, is satisfying...but without the 'mounting suspense' element, there are moments when the story drags a bit. Still, ""State of Play"" is very good, and worth watching!",N/A
519880,"The first of one of the best book to movie adaptations ever made! Normally I'd review the theatrical releases but I never got those and I can't really remember what wasn't in there before I bought this after I saw it theatres. The cast captures the characters perfectly, especially my favorite Christopher Lee, whose character, Saruman, doesn't feature in the first book at all (though I may be wrong, its been awhile since I read it). He tries to be friendly towards Gandalf (the part he orginally tried out for) and persuade him to join his cause but that ulitimately backfires and switches into evil, which the man plays very well. Elijah Wood plays Frodo innocent in the world at large and near the end, very mistrusting of the rest of the Fellowship, even Sam. The extended version captures the book better than what the theatrical release could (time constraints being the main problem) and I'm still very glad they didn't try to adapt the whole book as I'd probably still be in theatres now watching the second movie. There's just too many things that slow down the flow of the book and Peter Jackson trims at the fat and makes the story focus on Frodo and his journey and not the many side-trips he made like; Tom Bombadil (though a cherished character by fans I'm sure, his inclusion would've slowed the film down as the Hobbits spend quite some time with him even before they get to Bree) and I think there was an attack on the Fellowship by some wolves but then again, its been awhile since I read them. The action scenes, especially the swordsmanship I must point out, is some of the best I've seen next to the swordplay in Star Wars. The effects are also top notch, both special visual, the Balrog, the cave troll and the opening scene with the thousands of warriors imparticular. The make-up department, something I hardly ever comment on in my reviews, I must make a point to congratulate. It must've been painstaking to come up with so many different looks for the Orcs and Uruk-Hai. Howard Shore's score is one of my favorites, the Fellowship theme being fantastic and stirs a feeling of heroics within me (pretty much the same effect the Superman and Batman's themes make me feel).",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
480980,"Much more than Two Against Nature, because only 5 of the 9 tracks from that CD are featured in this concert video.  Instead we get great live versions of Green Earrings, Bad Sneakers, Josie, FM, Peg, Kid Charlemagne, Pretzel Logic, Babylon Sisters and Black Friday, that match or surpass the originals.  Wise choice, since all this material is stronger than most of Two Against Nature, my least favorite Dan album.  However, even the cuts from that CD performed here are taken up a notch. Oddly absent is the title track, a far better tune than What A Shame About Me, which they chose to include instead.Five stars for excellent audio quality and a very fine ensemble performance by Dan and musicians. I have a gripe with the unnecessarily quick-change camera work and weird angles that distract from just looking at the screen and enjoying the sounds.  However, the main attraction remains the audio, and it's easy enough to focus on that once you get used to it.In between songs is a variety of candid footage, including some ""interviews"" to which Donald and Walter subject several of their band members. These consist primarily of Donald and Walter heaping psychobabble on their victims in a manner I found frankly hilarious. Not sure what this says about me, but it's probably not good. I understand the negative comments many have posted regarding these interruptions in the concert flow, but personally I don't mind them. They're short and easy enough to skip over.This is one concert video that I will continue to play, since the performances and audio are on a par with or better than the original recordings.

Xiangyang is only a baby when his father, Gengnian, an aspiring artist, is thrown into a ""re-education camp"" on a trumped-up charge of disloyalty to the state.  When Gengnian is finally released and sent back to his family, Xiangyang is a nine-year-old boy with no memory of his dad and no interest in following in the old man's footsteps as a painter.  This sets up an ongoing conflict between father and son that extends well into Xiangyang's early adulthood.""Sunflower"" is a subtle, thoughtful, deliberately paced look at just how much influence a parent can reasonably be expected to have over the life of a child, as Xiangyang comes to realize that until he can get out from under the thumb of his father, he has no real hope of ever becoming a fully independent man in his own right.  For Gengnian, it's a matter of learning that he can't simply transfer all the thwarted and unfulfilled dreams he once had for his own life onto his son without eventually robbing the young man of his independence and breaking his spirit.The screenplay is scrupulously fair to all parties as it astutely explores the universal truths of filial relationships - with unmannered performances and self-effacing direction adding greatly to the naturalism of the piece.",N/A

I thought the riffing was good, especially for the two lame-brained leads who (of course) always place themselves in danger.  ""Lance"", the clumsy hero, is always just one step away from the next concussion.  ""Nora"", the terrorized woman, runs away from the horror by going into empty dark rooms.

1111225,"I've been a long time student of the Troubles, and I'm well acquainted with the case of the Birmingham Six, and I think they and the British people owe Chris Mullin a great deal for exposing the wrongful conviction of the Six for the worst case of mass murder on British soil before Lockerbie (which amounts to a huge miscarriage of justice itself given the Scottish Government's indefensible release of one of the bombers after serving just eight years of a supposed minimum of 27 on ""compassionate"" grounds).Unfortunately, I can't recommend ""Who Bombed Birmingham?""  The problem with it is that the story jumps around so much and so quickly (from 1974 to 1985 and back again), the dual narratives (the arrest, torture, and conviction of the Six in 1974 and the journalists uncovering it all in 1985) are never given any time to build momentum or make us care about either the wrongfully convicted men or the campaigning journalists.So the movie was disappointment for me, but I can definitely recommend another movie about a similar miscarriage of justice ""In the Name of the Father.""  It deals with another infamous set of IRA pub bombings and accompanying miscarriages of justice (the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven), has a much higher powered cast, better script, and production values.

This Puerto Rican family does things in a style that stimulates and displays life out loud. And that's a good thing.Coming together for the first time in ages are all of the children. Jesse (Freddy Rodriguez) has just returned home from a tour of duty in Iraq where he witnessed the death of a fellow solider, blaming himself in the process. Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) is in from California where the family thinks she's become a major movie/TV star. And Mauricio (John Leguizamo) and his wife Sarah (Debra Messing), a successful white collar couple, are in town as well, all the while questioned by mother Anna (Elizabeth Pena) why they haven't given her grandchildren yet.Yes, this family celebrates life passionately. Along with uncle Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), the young man who works in father Edy's (Alfred Molina) store, the whole bunch comes together to celebrate family. Until mom drops the bomb on them that she's divorcing dad.It seems Edy cheated once on Anna and she's never forgiven him. And now he's taken to being secretive about something, taking phone calls in private and hiding whatever it is. It's enough to convince her that he's doing it once again.The family is torn by this idea of the divorce. On one hand they want to support both their parents. On the other they want them to remain together. And at the same time each one has demons of their own to deal with.Roxanna is not the star everyone back home thinks she is, waiting with cell phone in hand to find out if she's gotten the part to make or break her career. Jesse is disturbed by his time at war as well as dealing with the girl he left behind who is now involved with someone else. And Mauricio is dealing with bouncing between allegiance to his wife or to his mother.Watching over all is Edy, taking in the whole picture. This character has more depth than is witnessed in words alone. He is the quiet one, trying to have a family holiday to outdo all others. And at the same time he has a secret that could prove devastating to them all. And it's not at all what Anna suspects.This film offers a great combination of humor and tenderness that shows what being a family is all about. Its not about just the good times or the bad, it's about living life. You can take the safe path as long as you like, but never see the beauty of the world in doing so.In the midst of this family is Sarah, the outsider, who may take a lot of guff from Anna, but who loves her husband and wants so much to be a part of this family. She gets her wish when she accidentally discovers Edy's secret. It's a burden more than the rest carry and one that is revealed by the end of the film.Not sweet as the candy of RUDOLPH, not as bitter as A CHRISTMAS CAROL and not as tear jerking as ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE, this film presents a different world at Christmas than we're used to. And perhaps that's a good thing.In a world where the family is falling apart, where single parents are becoming the norm, it's nice to see a film that focuses on the family, even if they are a bit different. It reminds us that the holidays are a time to get together. They are a time when family should be as one. With love, with laughter, with plenty of heart and with a touch of sadness, this film triggers all the emotions that a good holiday film can. And that makes it one worth renting this season.",Nothing Like the Holidays

1214379,"Finally, Wonder Woman has her own animated movie. Now where is her animated series? The pros heavily outweigh the cons in this latest adaptation and it couldn't have come soon enough for many die-hard fans. The animation, acting, story, and overall production is great. The only problems I had with it were Diana's personality - she was traditionally warmer than the rest of the amazons (though the greatest warrior of them all) and I found this incarnation to be a little rough around the edges. I also didn't like that her mother, Hippolyta, looked so much like her. I also prefer the traditional WWII era story as depicted in the 1970's live action series, but oh well. I also didn't believe how easily Steve Trevor accepted all of this fantastic mythological phenomenon happening all around him, from discovering a hidden island inhabited solely by women to an epic battle led by Ares the god of war. 74 minutes seemed too short. Still, this feature is way better than Batman Gotham Knight, and in many ways superior to Superman:Doomsday as well. The champ of recent DC animated features, however, is Justice League: The New Frontier. I hope Wonder Woman gets a weekly series out of this, or dare I say, a new franchise of live-action films. Enough with Superman and Batman already... give us more Wonder Woman!!!",N/A
1246492,"A large old house that used to be a funeral home serves as the setting for The Haunting In Connecticut, where the Campbell family moves to be closer to the hospital where their oldest son, Matt (Kyle Gallner) is receiving treatments for his cancer.  The rent for the place is unexpectedly cheap, and it's only after the family moves in that they realize that's because of the history of the place, its status as a former funeral home/mortuary, and the legends that have cropped up surrounding the place.  It seems that decades ago, it was used for seances, and the tale is that something went horribly wrong at one of these.Before the family even moves in, there's trouble, albeit of a more conventional nature.  The prognosis for Matt isn't that positive, the treatments he's undergoing are grueling, the family's finances are under severe stress from trying to pay for the treatments and support a household of six, including two younger siblings of Matt's - Billy and Mary - and their cousin Wendy (Amanda Crew fromSex Drive, who's living with the family due to an unspecified trouble in her own family.  The tension between the two parents, played by Virginia Madsen (fromCandyman (Special Edition)) and Martin Donovan, is present under a thin veil, and begins to surface more as conditions, both conventional and the dawning supernatural elements, mount.  Of the two, the mother is the more sympathetic, and while the conflict within the family isn't anything on the level of domestic abuse, the tension it creates folds right into the larger problems.  Also, unstated but implied, is the possibility that the forces in the house are 'drawing out' the darker, more volatile aspects in some of their personalities, in an Amityville-like fashion.  Ghostly elements within the house begin to manifest, primarily to Matt, and start taking on decidedly malevelont overtones.Matt establishes a friendship with a fellow cancer patient, a Reverend Popescu (Elias Koteas) , who he turns to as events continue to worsen.  The Reverend theorizes that these prescences are being triggered because they're more easily interacted with by someone already close to the other side - someone close to death, such as a cancer patient.  As events progress though, the phenomena become discernible to other family members, and more capable of effecting the physical world, often in violent ways.  In order to attempt to exorcise the house, the characters have to understand it, and the Reverend, along with Matt and Wendy, delve into the dark history of the house.Although slower-moving and more subdued than some horror movies, the pace and style doesn't hurt the movie, and indeed helps it to build its own distinct atmosphere of slowly mounting dread and in-the-shadows creepiness.  Very well-acted and well-produced, with the special effects, while minimal, being effective.  Much in the vein of movies likeThe Exorcism of Emily Rose - Unrated (Special Edition),The Amityville Horror(as well as its better sequels and the 2005 remake) andHaunted (Full Screen).  Although it may take a bit Too much time building up for some tastes, those who don't mind a subtler, more slow-building tone now and then will find this highly rewarding.A couple of lesser known films you might also want to check out if you like this one areRed Rover / Heritage De SangandPhone.",N/A
1228947,"The Reader (Stephen Daldry, 2008)It has taken me a very long time to get around to reviewing The Reader, Stephen Daldry's Oscar-winning flick. This is because every time I sat down to review it, I found that the controversy surrounding the movie was still going strong (or had re-ignited), and I wanted to wait until everyone had given closing arguments. At this point, I'm not sure that will ever happen, but it's reached that point where the usual suspects are rehashing the same tired arguments over and over, so I'm abandoning any pretense of being able to report something comprehensive and pretty much ignoring the whole thing; in other words, this is probably the same review I'd have written last December. oops.In The Reader, Daldry (The Hours) tells the story of Michael Berg (played as a teen by Krabat's David Kross and as an adult by Ralph Fiennes), a German boy in the fifties who finds himself befriending, and then becoming the lover of, tram ticket-taker Hannah Schmitz (Kate Winslet). All goes well for one wonderful summer, as Berg and Schmitz romp and Berg reads aloud to her as foreplay or afterglow; one day, however, Schmitz vanishes without a trace. Berg remains haunted by her disappearance until a few years later, when he's in law school and is assigned by one of his professors to cover the trial of a contingent of female Nazi guards; Schmitz is one of them. As if this isn't bad enough, when Berg puts some pieces of the trial together with what he knows of Schmitz, he realizes he has information that could change the outcome of the trial. What's a boy to do?The core of the movie, the piece by which it must stand or fall, is the performances of the two main characters by the three actors who play them. Winslet, who's been racking up Oscar nominations right and left, finally and deservedly won the Oscar that has eluded her for so long, while Kross and Fiennes are both phenomenal as the two phases of Berg. With all the controversy surrounding the setting and the subtexts here, when it comes right down to it, The Reader is a love story, and in that regard, it is an undeniable success.But one cannot ignore the setting and subtexts; without them, it would be as forgettable as something like Message in a Bottle. I have a confession to make; I have never been a fan of Stephen Daldry's films, and the reason for that is that Daldry has always been as subtle as a steel mallet when it comes to subtexts. While that is the case here in more than one scene (one of the very few places I had a problem with Kross here is the wordless scene at the prison, with an agonized look on his face right out of the climax of The Perfect Storm), Daldry has certainly learned to be more subtle with such things than he was in the awful Billy Elliott or the painfully maudlin The Hours. A bit more subtlety, a bit more flair, in the handling of the Nazi question and this could have been one for the ages (and, I'm sure far less controversial than it was); as it is, it's still enough of a success to get a high recommendation from yours truly. I should have given it seven months ago. Silly me. ****",N/A
1231178,"Why did Kim Basinger make this movie?That's all I could think of while watching this hugely disappointing movie.  Crude and brutal though at moments of action and dialogue, there's also strong man-hating theme.  Was this the attraction for Ms Basinger?The characters are poorly written and their motivations are obscure.In the very beginning, Basinger's character seems -- very clearly -- mentally unwell.  But she is also verbally and kind-of physically abused by her understandably frustrated husband.  Is Basinger's character supposed to be on medication?  She seems to be in a stupor at the start of the movie.  Or does she sit around the messy house all day drinking?  Something's not right.  But it's Christmas Eve.  So she goes out to buy wrapping paper and encounters some murderous thugs.  The thugs are ethnically diverse.There's no subtext here and the movie does not deliver the visceral thrills that demented fans (not me) of slasher films apparently crave.A sad exercise in hostility.  It won't make your holidays brighter (I guess it's a Christmas movie).Side step this one.NOTE: Some viewers have speculated this film is really about Ms Basinger's personal feelings regarding men in general and one man in particular.  But that's unfair and mean-spirited.  She is an immensely gifted actress, hopefully better scripts will come her way.)",N/A
1150301,"My first two thoughts on sitting down to watch this pretty-good film were ""Christ, Dustin Hoffman's getting old!"" And ""Wow, Emma Thompson looks great!"" Hoffman is Harvey Shine, professional New York advertising jingle writer who regrets never having become a jazz pianist. He and his wife split some years ago (he wasn't that great a husband or father, as he admits) and now his daughter is getting married in London. Having flown over to take part, he finds she wants her stepfather to give her away instead. Moreover, his career is falling apart and his boss finally sacks him by cell phone. That's half the set-up. There's also Emma as Kate Walker, self-employed as (apparently) an airport poll-taker with a couple of employees and a neurotic mother, whose social life seems to consist of going on blind dates set up by her friends only to be abandoned by whomever she's with. Harvey, naturally, bumps into Kate both arriving in the country and attempting to depart. But the airline screws up and he's delayed in London for another day, and the two sort of drift together -- largely because Harvey rather desperately insists on trying to establish a relationship. His doggedness about it is wince-provoking; in real life, Kate probably would tell him to sod off. But the funny thing is, in this story, it works. They spend a good deal of time walking and talking, Kate finally drags him to the wedding reception he hadn't meant to attend, and things work out finally with his daughter. It's a matter of Harvey trying to organize what is clearly his ""last chance"" for any kind of happiness and of the never-married Kate trying to decide whether to take the chance of being hurt. It's a nice little different sort of love story with some excellent acting.",Last Chance Harvey

He did a great job in portraying a wrestler who's seen his glory days and is just hanging on to survive.  Rourke gives a very subtle, nunanced performance that comes across so naturally.While I didn't really care for the film as a whole, it's basically about Rourke's character The Ram and his performance more than made up for any kind of holes in the film itself.

It's like they want this to be some kind of ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"" movie or something.""  Anyway, when I watched the special features, I learned that that was exactly what producer Judd Apatow and his cohorts were going for: a big, Jerry Bruckheimer-style action movie, only with clueless stoner guys as the heroes instead of strong confident types like Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise.  Fair enough.  Not a horrible concept.  But me?  I found the huge action scenes, sadistic villains, etc. a little distracting and the movie kind of bloated.

535672,"Most positive reviews for this movie seem to be centered around one fraze: ""Gerard Butler is HOT!"". Well, so he is. He manages to be funny at times, as well. But these qualities a watchable horror movie do not make. Butler's Dracula is the kind of a vamp you would invite to a dinner party to liven up the conversation and keep your single friends happy; you'd just want to wear a chastity belt around your neck at all times...He makes being a vampire an interesting proposition: you keep your youth, have lots of worry free sex, and in an instant gain formidable martial arts skills (the newly minted undead show off the kind of aerial highjinx that would make Bruce Lee green with envy...). So, why exactly is the guy so tormented???Further adding to the annoyance is the supporting cast full of TV actors. It is difficult to envision that harmless stoner from That Seventies Show, or that brilliant doc from House, as vicious vamps...Add an endless parade of cliches (long cape for Dracula seems to be a fashion staple) and smoke machines in overdrive, and your taste for blood... of the filmakers... enters a critical stage.The true star of the film is the brilliant idea for the origins of Dracula. No, I will not give away the secret, for, if you do decide to watch the film, this will be your only reward for doing so... Unfortunately, the makers waste here a fantastic opportunity to make a substantial contribution to the Dracula saga. To put it plainly, they have produced a poorly crafted movie.

441406,"It is hard to find a film that makes an unambiguous moral point without a wiff of preaching, but In The Heat Of The Night does this perfectlyVirgil Tibbs, played by Sidney Portier, is arrested in a small southeren town in 1967 for a murder that happend that night. He is black and has cash on him. In those days, that was a guilty verdict. We soon find out, though, that he is a cracker jack homicide detective from Philadelpia, on the way home from visiting his mom, and Tibbs turns from suspect to, grudingly, lead investigator.Tibbs nemisis in the film is Chief Bill Gillespie, played by Rod Stieger. Gillespie is not a brutal racist, just an old ignorent southerner bigoted by the segragated south he grew up in. His police force is the same, and they all struggle with the fact that Tibbs is smarter than all of them combigned.There are the expected crackers chasing Tibbs in the film, but the movie is really more about the subtle prejudice that Tibbs has to deal with. Gillespie actually respects and likes Tibbs , but is too bound by place and time to admit this.The south had JUST desegragted in 1967 and most of the impact had not hit the small towns. By placing Tibbs in this situation, the film deals with not the burning cross or the lynching, but far more intractable raceism that America was just starting to deal with. It does so through the local. Not once are the words segragation or intagration used in In The Heat Of The Night.Like the issue, then and now, everything happened between a  few people in the smallest of places.

1023812,"Superman is the Grand Old Man of superheroes, and so a movie dusting the character off after an almost twenty year absence needs to walk a fine line between reverance and pure high adventure.  Bryan Singer's Superman Returns does just that ... at once a loving homage to the great work Richard Donner did in 1978 with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman and an elegant re-imagining of a hero we all know by heart, even if we think we don't.  What Bryan Singer delivers is a smart, action-packed and heartfelt movie, bringing Superman to us after a fruitless 5 year search for his home planet, Krypton.  His return to earth as Clark Kent coincides with Lex Luthor's newest real estate scheme, this one involving Kryptonite and a place to detonate it.  (It's funny that the Lex Luthor of the Superman movie universe is so brilliant but only obsessed with real estate.  And Kevin Spacey does the arch-nemesis complete justice ... making him both funny and very terrifying.)  Our first real encounter with Brandon Routh's Superman (an excellent Brandon Routh) is a set-piece involving a fiery airplane and an endangered Lois Lane.  This first glimpse of him is as satisfying as when Christopher Reeve snagged a falling Margot Kidder from the Daily Planet building and she screeched ""You've got me?  Who's got you?""  And statistically, flying is still the safest way to travel. -- Brandon Routh's Superman already has an old soul and he wins our hearts from the beginning.  He is an alien on an alien world and his outsider status never fails to touch us.  This is not a question of Superman Returns being the best movie since Reeves' first two outings.  Superman Returns belongs on the same shelf with these two.  It is, simply, the most satisfying super hero movie to come along in a long while.  Epic and intimate, spectacular and touchingly ordinary, Superman Returns does proper tribute to the first (and best) superhero flying around out there.  Highly recommended.",N/A

Animal made up for it as Hawk whipped Earthquake into Animal, who hit him with a great chair shot.The Rumble: I enjoyed the Rumble but it was far from my favorite of all time. If you listen thru out the entire PPV you know Flair is going win the world title.Overall, the Rumble is only saved due to the main event. The trio of tag matches were atrocious and Mountie-Piper was short but enjoyable. The commentating was excellent thru out the event.",N/A

1067355,"My title kind of oversimplifies the theme and vibe of the movie, but it's basically the ""exploring horror film cliches in real life"" approach done with a mix of the usual gorefest camera work and the hand held/documentary style you see in [Rec] or Blair Witch.Normally all of those qualifiers would be an instant turnoff for me (though I loved [Rec] madly), but this is seriously one of the most entertaining, enjoyable and (until the very end at least) unpredictable films I've seen lately - horror or otherwise. The cast is fantastic, the writing is great and it never gets slow or boring for a second. All of that also contributes to one of my favorite aspects - that it goes from hilarious to bloody and back without missing a beat.People that love the horror ""genre"" will appreciate it (and the cameos - Robert Englund's parts are brief but fabulous), whereas anyone looking for a typical Final Destination-type teen slasher will probably turn it off halfway through.

1191667,"Last night on HBO I watched the premiere of this American Girl movie. I enjoyed the Kit movie from last year, they are really on a roll now I have to say!!  This movie is a MUST see for students from 3rd or 4th grade and up. The movie is about a 5th grade girl who is new to a school and is soon bullied by a click of 3 girls, one in particular named Tara.  This is not a sugar coated movie and you see Chrissa's situation go from bad to worse as she struggles to handle it by herself.I figured this movie would be like every other typical Disney-style movie where Chrissa will eventually get revenge on the ""bad guy"", you know with some plot where say she makes some elaborate contraption which will embarrass the heck out of Tara and spill green paint on her or whatever and everyone will laugh at Tara and Chrissa will be the hero. That is NOT how this story goes at all, and I am very impressed American Girl (who is in the DOLL business) did not fantasy candy-coat the story.  Rather, as you will see, it is shown with much more realism and makes you think about what you would do if you were in Chrissa's (or her parents') situation.I actually have someone who has been bullying my 10 year old daughter over the past few months and ironically I got a few pointers from this movie last night, it made me think a little different about how to approach the situation.  It also reinforced some of my beliefs on what makes someone a bully as well as providing some tips on ways to keep Chrissa staying strong.Like other viewers, I bet you will be curious to see what bully Tara's parents look like - in every other movie (e.g. Camp Rock) the snobby/mean girl's mother is usually some self-centered witch who is nasty with her daughter and thus the chain continues....in this movie, you never get to see her parents. I think that is a good thing because it really let me focus on the rest of the story.  I am seriously considering buying a copy for my local school and/or library to donate it, it was that good. The acting was fantastic and Chrissa is absolutely charming, I would love to have a friend like her for myself or my daughter!",N/A

1228487,"""Quantum of Solace"" is the 22nd James Bond film, the second starring Daniel Craig, who continues his characterization of James Bond as an emotionally damaged, nearly sociopathic killer in the employ of MI6. The plotline follows through from ""Casino Royale"". Bond has kidnapped the infamous ""Mr. White"" of the mysterious ""Quantum"" organization, only to find that it is more ubiquitous and dangerous than MI6 imagined. Following a lead to Haiti, Bond finds himself in the company of Bolivian beauty Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko), a former intimate, now enemy, of a Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). Mr. Greene is president of an environmental organization that purchases or extorts land to exploit for profit or power. Now he is funding a coup in Bolivia in order to secure oil drilling rights for the CIA, whom he intends to double-cross. Bond's stoic exterior conceals an ""inconsolable rage"" at the death of his lover Vesper Lynd, making him even more a loose cannon than ever.The film takes its title from an otherwise unrelated short story by Ian Fleming. Just what ""Quantum"" is is still obscure, but at least ""Quantum of Solace"" is shorter and without the gaping holes in its plot that afflicted ""Casino Royale"". There is still an overly long, tedious foot chase near the beginning of the film, but the other action sequences are more compelling -if chaotic- than those in the previous film. What I find interesting is that the characterization of both Bond and the entire intelligence community is a radical departure from the first 20 Bond films. Bond is no longer the good guy. He is morally adrift, a licensed killer absorbed by grief, who cannot always tell his friends from his enemies. He's more of an anti-hero than a hero. Far from being fun or glamorous, sex now equals death. Every woman Bond beds meets a tragic, often gruesome, end at the hands of his enemies.We know very little about ""Quantum"", except that it does bad things, so it must be bad. The intelligence community is engulfed in moral chaos. The CIA occupies itself with securing oil reserves without so much as a nod to freedom or justice. Vengeance is the most common motivator. It almost makes Greene, who is motivated purely by profit, seem like a welcome relief. MI6's methodologies and trail of corpses leave much to be desired in the way of restraint and ethics. MI6 lacks any moral compass or even a clear objective. The enemy is nebulous, and it isn't clear what anyone is fighting for or what they hope to achieve. Even an environmental organization is just a front for a utility monopoly. It's like global gang warfare. Bond is both the agent of the chaos and its victim. In this world, when people don't have a clear enemy, they make one up, but it is never actually clear, and they are left with nothing to measure their own behavior by.The DVD (MGM 2009 single disc): The bonus features on the single disc edition are a music video (4 1/2 min) for ""Another Way to Die"" by Alicia Keys and Jack White, a theatrical teaser (2 min), and a theatrical trailer (2 min).

602320,"If you are a fan of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" this movie is a must-see. In ""Red Dragon"" we see how Hannibal Lecter was actually caught at the beginning of the original film and why he is in prison. This film is a prequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" as we get the back story on the cinema's most vicious villin. Anthony Hopkins, as usual, is fantastic as Lecter, but it is Ralph Fiennes who steals this film. Like the original film ""The Red Dragon"" has two stories running concurrently: not only are we treated to a great story on Lecter, but another serial killer mastermind is murdering people called The Tooth Fairy, played by Fiennes. It is up to a smart FBI agent, played by Edward Norton, to catch this maniac. Ralph Fiennes gives the greatest performance of his career in this movie, as we see the tortured life he leads, as he was abused by his horrific grandmother who is not seen on film; only her voice is heard in flashbacks. The voice is none other than Ellen Burstyn. Just hearing the grandmother's voice yelling at her grandson gives the audience the background on what eventually made this murderer; there is always a reason behind the behavior. Emily Watson has a supporting role, playing a blind woman who befriends the Fiennes evil character. Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a journalist who gets caught and tortured by the Tooth Fairy. I won't tell you what happens to his character!The DVD is in widescreen format, the trailer is included, there is commentary by director Brett Ratner and writer Ted Tally who wrote the original film, there is a great profile on Hannibal Lecter, deleted scenes, and much more. An excellent film that was a huge hit at the boxoffice. Time magazine calls the movie ""brilliantly darkly seductive!"".",N/A

360468,"My initial reactin to ""Trafic"" was disappointment.  I was really expecting something with more and better humor.  As I write this the following day, I'm reminded of the title and realizing that the film is better than my first impression.  What I failed to absorb last night was the overview of motor vehicles in our modern society.  While bemoaning the limited slapstick humor, I was missing the social satire.  Dozens of new realizations have been coming to me this morning not the least of which was the use of a broken down truck to transport a state-of-the-art vehicle.  Gradually the various scenes of drivers reacting to their boredom, the engineered chaos of parking lots, the domino effect of one vehicle failing to follow the rules, the failure to recognize simple sollutions when everything else is so complicated, the adoration we have for bigger and better modes of transportation, etc began to sink in.  My second opinion is better than my first but this only raises ""Trafic"" from Good to Better.  I cannot give it 5 stars because, frankly, too much of the film is spent setting up some rather mediocre scenes that fail to deliver.  Maybe the humor was still stuck in traffic.",N/A

189033,"Tourist Trap is one of the best horror films of the 70's.  It has everything that a horror film needs, decent acting, good sfx, great score, and an extremely eerie atmosphere.The movie centers around a group of twenty-somethings in search of their lost friend.  They stumble upon an old tourist trap ran by a kind old man...Upon searching for a phone they discover the old man has a dark secret.I first saw this film on a beat up old VHS way back in middle school, it left an impression on me back then and still to this day remains one of my favorite horror movies.  It's proof that a film doesn't need a huge budget to be impressive.Full Moon has finally given this film the treatment it deserves with the release of this DVD.  While the special features are on the slim side the transfer is nothing short of amazing and that's all that really matters.  The picture quality is top notch and the colors vibrant.  The sound mix is very impressive and Pino Donaggio's beautiful score stands out.Now all we need is a Blu-ray, but since that probably won't happen during this decade, I'd recommend picking up this DVD.The price is low and the movie truly is creepy.",N/A
1128909,"You'd think that at least one vampire would wise up and take advantage of the fact that Alaska spends many a day in the dark.  As far as I am aware, no such fate has befallen the great northern state.  Based on the comic miniseries of the same name, ""30 Days of Night"" gives us a good look at what might happen if a vampire and a few of his undead friends would sink their fangs into the Land of the Midnight Sun.The film opens with the small town of Barrow, Alaska preparing for its month-long dive into darkness (hence the thirty days of night).  Most of the town's citizens are heading for sunnier locations, but a select few stay behind and stick it out.  In this small group is the local sheriff, Eben (Josh Hartnett).  While everyone is getting ready to leave, he's busy investigating a number of strange criminal acts (burning of cellular phones, slaughtering sled dogs, etc.).  As he digs deeper into his investigation, he arrests a stranger (Ben Foster) who begins to wax prophetic about someone or something coming and that no one will survive.Also staying behind (due to missing her flight) is Eben's estranged wife Stella (Melissa George).  She assists Eben in arresting the stranger and goes with the pair to the sheriff's station where Eben's grandmother and brother are.As soon as the sun goes down, chaos reigns supreme.  Eben goes to check on the local telephone office and discovers a brutal murder/decapitation.  Scared, he heads back to town and warns those that stayed behind to hide in their homes.  As it gets darker, more and more people begin to die.  Soon the streets are filled with blood and snow as a gang of vampires feast on the townsfolk.A few survivors of the initial attack (including Eben and Stella) hole up in an attic and make plans to survive for the next month.  The rest of the film shows the small group attempting to stay alive by using their knowledge of the town and the brutal snowfall to their advantage.  Along the way, a few other survivors are picked apart by the vampire group which is headed up by Marlowe (Danny Huston).As supplies become scarce and time begins to wear on them, the survivors take more and more chances in order to stay alive.  This leads up to an eventual standoff with the vampires.  Who lives?  Who dies?  Who finally gets to see the rising sun?  Watch ""30 Days of Night"" and you'll find out.The film's premise is great.  It takes a legendary creature and puts in the one place that gives it seemingly every advantage over its victims.  Isolated, cold, and in complete darkness, the average human would find it hard to survive with limited resources in such environs.  Throw in a gaggle of bloodsucking immortals and you've really got problems.The film's special effects are very good as well.  They are bloody, gory, and very realistic.  The makeup department also did a very good job.Josh Hartnett's portrayal of Eben was very believable.  Unlike the untouchable heroes in many films, he reacts to the initial vampire attacks with fear and confusion.  I actually felt for his character as he tried to make sense of his situation.  Melissa George is fairly convincing in her role as well.  Mark Boone Junior nearly steals the show as Beau Brower, an unlikely hero in the film.Unfortunately, Steve Niles and Stuart Beattie's story drags along at times and lacks a really convincing enemy.  Despite being the leader of the vampire gang and seemingly full of wisdom, Marlowe just isn't that scary.  There's never a moment in this film where I looked at Danny Huston's character and thought, ""There's no way they can stop this guy.""  Whether it was Huston's performance or the direction of Huston by David Slade, I felt that the weak villain was the film's greatest downfall.Despite this, I still recommend ""30 Days of Night.""  While it isn't the best vampire film out there, it is much more loyal to its wicked origins than many of today's modern vampires.  In a time where most bloodsuckers are busy courting teen girls or hanging out at Fangtasia, it's nice to see some truly evil vampires make their way out of the darkness.",N/A

958328,"So many have said so much in the reviews posted here. I'll just add a brief bit:Once when C.S. Lewis (my favorite author) was asked in a letter which was his favorite Dickens novel, he said ""I think I'd have to place Bleak House at the top."" Suffice it to say that this wonderful BBC production does justice to Dickens' magnificent literary work -- and that is no mean achievement. Some have objected to the modern stylistic touches utilized in the filming, but I rather enjoyed them, and never felt they took away from the altogether classic nature of the story. The acting was superb all around, the writing superlative, and the original material (thank you, Charles) is some of the finest the English language has given shape to. I hesitate to single out any of the performances from the rest (so fine were they all), but if pressed I might say that Martin, Lawson, Gorman, and Dance were so excellent they could hardly have been better. But several others were also terrific ('Krook', 'Smallweed', 'Woodcourt', 'Sergeant George' ... oh, bother, I could go on), and there was no real weak link in the chain. Since it is not often mentioned I might add that the musical theme, with its air suggesting intrigue and forboding, maintains the high standard of this drama. And finally I ask, was not Charles Dickens one of the greatest namers of characters the world of literature has seen? Dedlock? Skimpole? Tulkinghorn? First-rate, that!Good luck finding eight hours of television viewing as edifying as this BBC high-water mark, BLEAK HOUSE.",N/A

1144179,"Charlie Wilson's War is based on the book by ""60 Minutes"" producer George Crile, which was based on Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson, and little known but astonishing historical events. The screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, the man behind ""The West Wing,"" is chock full of the kind of crisp dialogue Sorkin is known for. The director is Mike Nichols, who has quite a r&eacute;sum&eacute; ranging from Whose Afraid of Viginia Woolf? in 1966 to 2004's Closer. Mr. Nichols couldn't ask for a better cast, with Oscar winners Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman supported by a cast just as capable as Charlie's Angels--not the ones from the TV Show or the subsequent remake and sequel, the ones on the real Charlie Wilson's staff.Tom Hanks found the charming Congressman a good fit. He made it look so easy you forgot he was acting at all. Julia Roberts made a surprisingly good ultra right wing socialite Joanne Herring. Philip Seymour Hoffman created a complex and compelling character--crusty CIA agent Gust Avrakotos kicking against the grain of the Ivy League culture at The Company. In the behind the scenes bonus material where you see the actual people portrayed, you see that perhaps they had to be toned down a bit, just to be believable. They are all such larger than life and colorful characters, but the actors did a great job of getting the essential nature of the people onscreen. It is a story where people actually make a difference and change the world, in spite of their supposed character flaws--or even because of them. They make some very good lemonade. The real Charlie Wilson gave the film makers free license to portray him as a person who ""likes to chase whiskey and drink women"" because that's what he was. One thing he was not, however; was a hypocrite.-------------Charlie's Angel #4: The Congressman has never been to rehab. They don't serve whisky at rehab.=====================And that, Boo Boo, he tells her, is why she is his press secretary. Amy Winehouse would be proud. Speaking of colorful characters, Joanne Herring is quite the ardent lover of freedom and the American Way, and passionate in its defense. She is given credit as the person who notices the situation in Afghanistan, suffering under a brutal occupation by the Soviets, and pushes Charlie Wilson to do something about it. Though an ultra right wing conservative socialite from Texas, Joanne Herring is nobody's fool. Julia Roberts really has a lot of fun playing her. At one point, after they are in a celebratory mood, she leaves a bar and as she passes by about three of the women on Charlie's staff she uses a common derogatory term reserved for women of easy virtue. I was shocked, but on reflection, I think she was just teasing them, and the unspoken subtext was 'aren't we all? And me, especially.' There is a great scene where Joanne asks Charlie's aid Bonnie (Amy Adams) to get her a dry Bombay martini, straight up, with two olives. Bonnie bristles at being treated like a servant, but Joanne knows she outranks her, and brushes her aside. Though ticked off, she nevertheless goes to fetch the drink.------------------Joanne Herring: She doesn't like me.Charlie Wilson: Everybody likes you.Joanne Herring: She's a liberal.Charlie Wilson: I'm a liberal.Joanne Herring: [puts her hand on his butt] Not where it counts.=============================Lots of sharp, witty dialogue, in the Sorkin manner, between Charlie, Joanne, and Gust. While you are being entertained by it all, the film is also presenting a very solid case for why the covert war in Afghanistan was worthy of support, and how the defeat of the supposedly invincible Red Army in Afghanistan led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was amazing that not only did Charlie Wilson sway congress to act; he also got Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia to support them. All under the radar. Their only regret was that after helping Afghanistan defeat the Russians, they did little to help them rebuild, resulting in the rise of the Taliban. I wouldn't call the film historical revisionism as much as it is just revealing a little history that was overlooked at the time. Did I mention the sharp and witty dialogue?----------------------Charlie Wilson: I stood in Harold Holt's office in Islamabad, and I offered him the keys to the safe. I said to him, ""What do you need?"" And I was apparently annoying him.Gust Avrakotos: Well, that's because Harold Holt is a tool. He's a cake-eater, he's a clown, he's a bad station chief, and I don't like to cast aspersions on a guy, but he's going to get us all killed.========================================SELECTED FILM ROLES FROM THE CAST OF CHARLIE WILSON'S WARDoubt(2008) ....

1208955,"By my reckoning (and as of this writing), this is Clint Eastwood's third masterpiece as a director and star.The first two were ""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"".What's Clint's secret to making such outstanding films?Simple -- he doesn't give a fig for what some studio suits think will be commercial.  Instead he looks for a good script.The script for ""Gran Torino"", like U and MDB, is simply impeccable.  Yes, it's filled with vulgarity and racist language such as you may never have heard onscreen, but that doesn't diminish its command of story and character.The truth is, I wasn't very keen to see this movie when I saw the commercials.  Ho hum, Clint playing another crusty old codger.But then I saw an available copy of GT at my local Redbox kiosk and took it home.Like MDB, the film gets under your skin, and it had me bawling like a baby through the last half hour and crying some more the next day.To say this film is surprising and deeply moving is an understatement.  If you like great movies, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.I have deducted one star just because of the paucity of special features on the DVD -- no director's commentary, no behind-the-scenes making-the-film featurette, just some stuff about cars.I hope that this deficiency will be rectified soon with a better Collector's Edition...

1194407,"TAKEN is a fast paced, well designed and choreographed action thriller that details the return to duty of an intelligence man, whose career distanced him from his family, when his own daughter falls victim to the crime syndicate in Paris. The driver of this well written (Luc Besson! and Robert Mark Kamen), well directed (Pierre Morel) film is the non-stop violence filled mission of a desperate father whose skills at getting to the heart of a matter have not been diminished by his 'early retirement'.Liam Neeson is in grand form as Bryan Mills, the skilled and committed father who can out kill and out wit even the most vicious of the Albanian forces against whom he must struggle to save his kidnapped daughter from being sold into human slavery to an Arab sheik. The film moves so rapidly, with the skills of cinematographer Michel Abramowicz, that the various other characters who populate this drama scarcely have time to establish an identity (Famke Janssen, Radivoje Bukvic, Maggie Grace et al).  The violence is constant but due to Bryan Mills' skills each death is so rapid that the camera doesn't linger  There are scenes in the brothels where the drug induced young girls serve as prostitutes that are quite disturbing, but again the camera doesn't pause long enough to make them gruesome.This is a fine performance by Liam Neeson who demonstrates a mastery of the action roles that likely will lead to others in a similar vein.  It is a wild ride, but a very fine one.  Grady Harp, May 09",Taken

Then again, the only thing worse is the dialog the actors are forced to say. All fight scenes in movies are choreographed but the good ones are seamless so you can't tell. The fight scenes in Ultraviolet are a ballet with every move telegraphed so you never believe any of it for a second.

841543,"Generally speaking, the Universal Legacy Collection volumes tend to feature one immensely well done film and a mixed bag of sequels.  The Mummy Legacy Collection is unique, however, both because the first film is not part of the same franchise as the four films that follow and because the quality in nearly all of these films is sub-par when compared to the usual Universal Monster standard.  With the exception of one severely underrated sequel in this volume (""The Mummy's Ghost""), I consider these to be mediocre films, most feeling like B films shot on A film budgets.The Mummy **: What should have been an amazing film is repeatedly compromised by its direction and its studio.  Karl Freund, the cinematographer legend who revolutionized the look of both cinema and television, was drafted to direct this film at the very last second.  Freund had never directed a film in his life, and that comes across clearly.  While the film is filled with lavish sets and strong visuals (Karloff's intense close-ups with his burning eyes are nothing less than iconic), it fails to take any stance on the story, itself.  The Mummy is motivated by intense love, and yet Karloff's acting and Freund's cameras do not sympathize with him.  At the same time, if The Mummy is not the protagonist with whom we side, who is?  The professor's obnoxious, lazy, and impulsive son?  We're left with a less than terrifying film about a somewhat creepy looking lover/killer who is neither a monster nor the tragic figure with whom we sympathize.  Freund applies no level of pathos to the script, nor does he compel it from Karloff.  Instead, we get an indecisive, yet beautiful looking film that never really works on the emotions in the way that it should.  Perhaps, had the studio not cut a sequence in which we see Karloff's character follow his lover across various time-periods, each time failing to keep her, the film would resonate differently.  Instead, as it stands, The Mummy fails to capture the terror of Dracula nor the tragic pathos of Frankenstein.  It falls carelessly between the two, never really delivering anything more than a memorable set of burning eyes.  Oh, and I'd be amiss to leave out the fact that Karloff ceases to appear as a mummy after the first scene of the film.  A disappointment all around.The Mummy's Hand ***: Eight years later, The Mummy franchise resets itself with a far simpler, more action-oriented monster flick with a similar (yet different) mummy (who actually appears as a mummy throughout the film), a simple yet likable band of heroes, a new and more imaginative set of rules surrounding the Mummy mythos, and a plot that holds together reasonably well if you give it a healthy suspension of disbelief.  Don't approach this film looking for artistry of any kind.  It's a great B horror film; nothing more and nothing less.The Mummy's Tomb **: The first sequel to The Mummy's Hand fast forwards many years and features geriatric versions of the previous film's protagonists, as well as a boring son who looks like Basil Rathbone but lacks his acting skills, and an Egyptian priest villain who is blatantly Japanese to suit the anti-Japan hysteria of post-Pearl Harbor America.  If this sounds like a recipe for a lame sequel, you're not entirely wrong.  The only saving grace is Lon Chaney Jr., who really defines the morbid and deformed presence of the mummy.  The film's watchable, but it's hardly entertaining.The Mummy's Ghost *****: Here's where the franchise offers up a tremendous surprise.  The second sequel to The Mummy's Hand borrows the strongest ingredients from the previous films and then takes the franchise to the next level.  We actually see Kharis (the Mummy) finally begin to take on true characterization.  With even more limitations placed upon him than Karloff's Frankenstein monster (can't talk, and you can barely see any facial expressions beneath those bandages), we can still see Chaney's Mummy experience frustration, rage, love, and resolute sadness.  Add to this John Carradine playing the best villain of the entire series (think Christopher Lee meets Willam Defoe meets Peter Lorre), likable characters, and one draw-dropping surprise ending, and you're in for one heck of a viewing experience.  I honestly don't understand how this film gets overlooked by classic horror fans.The Mummy's Curse *: The worst of the series, in my humble opinion.  The characters are woefully under-developed, there's almost no plot and certainly no recognizable protagonists until the last twenty minutes of the film, there are massive plot holes, and the resolution is entirely unsatisfying.  This is a film that simply didn't need to be made.  Perhaps its one saving grace is that we finally get a Mummy film where the evil priest doesn't spontaneously fall in love and thereby undo himself at the end of the film.All in all, this is one sleeper of a franchise with a few minor exceptions:- You get the first mediocre film, featuring Karloff, some beautiful visuals, and a premise that could have been amazing if given to another director.- The second film is fun, if cheesy.- The fourth film is a true masterpiece and absolutely worth seeing on its own.One great film, one almost great film, two B films, and a severely disappointing final entry.  It's a mixed bag, to say the least, but It's still worth a viewing if you have the cash to burn.",N/A

I say that because the last third of the film featured an expectation of some dreaded act about to be committed, giving it a film noir feel.One thing for sure, whatever you label the movie: it's well-acted, well-directed and well-photographed. Regarding the latter, this really looks good on DVD. No surprise it's directed well since George Stevens was the director. His resume speaks for itself.Obviously Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor are the ""big names"" in this film, but I found Shelly Winters and the character she played to be the most intriguing. She wasn't really appealing yet one could certainly identify with her feelings of insecurity with Taylor as her competition. ""Liz"" was in in her prime, looks-wise, with an absolutely classic face.Anyway, watching the character studies of the antsy Winters and the troublesome Clift were interesting. Clift, as is the case with most of us, causes his own problems and things slowly unravel for him. The story is another example of what can happen when one tries to cover up the truth.

1231450,"The great disappointment of Peter Jackson's ""The Lovely Bones"" isn't that it's so unpleasant, but that it tackles unpleasantness in a way that, for the most part, isn't compelling. It tells the story of Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a murdered teenage girl whose spirit wanders in a kind of emotional purgatory, and even in death, she's angry at her killer and desperate for her family to move forward; while the idea is indeed a powerful one, the structure of the film is so disjointed and psychologically confusing that it's difficult for the idea to completely sink in. This is a well intentioned story, and there were individual moments I thought were handled nicely. But on the whole, it falls short, lacking focus, precision, and the right balance between plot, spectacle, mystery, and heavy-handed drama.As the spirit of Susie wanders through a spectacular dreamscape of vast oceans, immense mountains, and sprawling fields, she periodically interjects with voiceover narrations, which not only diminish the power of interpretation, but also are so shamelessly poetic, mature, and philosophically profound that they really just belabor the point. If there's anything we learned from Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner,"" it's to trust that the audience will understand what's going on without the aid of droning verbal explanations. I'm well aware that Alice Sebold's original novel was written in the first person, but must I remind you that books are not movies and movies are not books? When a story is finally given the visual treatment, when the words on the page are reinterpreted for the big screen, long stretches of expository dialogue are simply not necessary.Neither the novel nor the film made any secret of the identity of Susie's killer; we know right off the bat that it was her neighbor, George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). It's much easier to believe in this character when he's alone in his house, methodically toiling away on finely detailed dollhouses and precise scale drawings for underground hideaways, ones that will eventually be made from branches, wood, and earth. He's isolated, addicted to routine, and always scheming - a man obsessed. When he's in the presence of other people, however, he isn't even remotely convincing as the man no one would suspect of being a serial killer. Not once does he seem like a ""normal"" neighbor, not even when the police are interrogating him in his living room.Caught in the middle of this tragedy is Susie's family, who for months endure painful uncertainties. Her father, Jack (Mark Wahlberg), is especially hard hit, eventually becoming so obsessed with discovering the truth that he drives away his long suffering wife, Abigail (Rachel Weisz). Of all the things ""The Lovely Bones"" gets wrong, it's portrayal of the Salmon family is just about right, Jackson apparently understanding that everyone mourns in their own way and that some have a harder time of it than others. The only exception to this is Susie's grandmother, Lynn (Susan Sarandon), who I never once believed was capable of bringing stability back into the Salmon home; she's a hard-drinking, chain-smoking, wise-cracking hurricane of a woman so stylistically out of place that it's impossible to accept her.Other characters, most notably Susie's would-be love interest (Reece Ritchie) and misunderstood former classmate (Carolyn Dando), are adequately played but serve no real purpose other than to provide Susie with another outlet for wordy narrations. Even Len Fenerman, the detective assigned to investigate Susie's disappearance (Michael Imperioli), isn't given much to do except generate tension within the Salmon family for failing to find leads. I was, however, taken with Susie's sister, Lindsay (Rose McIver), a strong-willed, independent young woman who goes the lengths others aren't willing to go. This leads to the film's most effective scene, when she breaks into George Harvey's home and searches for clues. The suspense is palpable, to say the least.If only the rest of the film had been as well-crafted. There's no denying that deep emotion courses through the story, and yes, much of it is relatable. In addition, there is something to be said for sparing the audience from disturbing visuals that would have amounted to nothing but shock value, namely Susie's murder and dismemberment. And, of course, the scenes of Susie in spirit-world are visually creative; I especially enjoyed a shot of gigantic ship-in-a-bottle kits sailing on a turbulent ocean and crashing against the rocky shore, which happens just as Jack angrily smashes his own ship-in-a-bottle collection. None of this is an issue. What is an issue is that, for everything it was meant to be emotionally and visually, the inconsistent tones and development of character made none of it convincing.That being said, I'm sure many will respond to this movie, regardless of whether or not they've read Sebold's novel. Not everyone can relate to the pain of losing a loved one, especially if violence was involved, but most can imagine what it must be like, and the simple truth is that Peter Jackson knows this and uses it to his advantage. Take from this movie what you will. I personally would have preferred a more coherent screenplay, one that relied less on narrative passages and more on plot, plausible character development, and style. It would be too much to say that ""The Lovely Bones"" is a bad film; in spite of the end result, its heart was in the right place. It would be more accurate to say that it's awfully misguided, like singing when you know the words but not the music.",The Lovely Bones

1030078,"As a hardcore Bigfoot enthusiast (though not a believer) and a HUGE fan of monster movies for the past 30 something years, I've seen most of the Bigfoot films out there.  Some, like ""The Curse of Bigfoot"" used to be shown on creature features in the '70s and I ate them up as a kiddo.  Ditto ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" and ""Snowbeast.""  The monsters were blood-thirsty, the actors were fairly amateur at best, and the action was just enough to keep the flick from gettin gboring.The latest crop of Bigfoot films have been a fairly mixed bag.  Some (like ""Sasuqtch"" and ""Yeti"") are so bad, that even as a deyed in the wool B-movie afficianado, I simply can't sit through them without a half gallon of cheap whiskey. And even then, I'd rather go put my head in a bread mixer for 90 minutes. Others like ""Abominable,"" ""Sasquatch Hunters,"" and this movie, are damned entertaining in that '70's and '80's bad movie way.  Plenty of action, hardcore monsters, and no shortage of blood and guts.  ""Sasquatch Mountain"" starts as a bank heist movie.  There's cops, robbers, shooting, and a porn star-looking hostage to boot.  From there, it goes on to resemble (to me at least) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Firday the 13th movies.  Namely, a group of people is caught in unfamiliar territory, being pursued by a huge, scary, angry, and homicidal monster that simlpy wants them dead.  They run, it follows.  They hole up in a cabin, it follows.  Turns out the guy who owns the cabin is dead on the can ""like Elvis"" as one of the characters points out. Also just so happens the dead guy has been feeding the monster with horse grain, and the monster's a mom to boot.  Seems momma monster's simply been protecting her territory from the intruders.  The kills are pretty good (not great) and the characters are prone to incredibly akward and stilted expository dialogue, the likes of which you only ever see in bad WB teeny bopper shows (at least from what I can tell by seeing the previews of them in commercials).  BUT, there's action, Lance Henriksen doing his thing as only he can, a leading lady with huge, bouncy silicone boobs, and best of all, at the end of the movie, they play an actual 911 recording of a guy calling to report a ""real"" Bigfoot encounter.  The geek in me jumped for joy and nearly dropped his inhaler.The ""making of"" featurette is pretty good as well. I wasn't expecting something like this on a straight to DVD flick, but there's a brief, though informative bit on the makeup fx design of the creature, interviews with the actors, and a set visit.  An excellent surprise, and endeared the film even more to me.All in all, well worth the $2.50 I paid for it. Heck, I'd have paid $10.00 for it since I'll be watching it again for sure. If you're a fan of Bigfoot horror movies and are on the fence about this one, just go ahead and buy it.  You'll be really glad you did.",Sasquatch Mountain

713224,"An Italian production, Eaten Alive (Mangiati Vivi) is a mind-numbing fantasy adventure set in the jungles of New Guinea, involving cannibals, and a religious cult, similar to that in Jonestown, Guyana.  This film is not for the squeamish, as true to the title, people are indeed eaten alive.  Also served up are ample nudity, dismemberment, sexual abuse, rape, decapitation, severed genetalia, and the butchery of humans and animals.  Does it sound like a fun time?Sheila Morris (Janet Agren) leaves New York for New Guinea, in search of her older sister Diane (Paola Senatore) who has vanished there.  Upon arrival, she enlists the help of adventurer Mark Butler (Robert Kerman) to act as a guide.  The ill prepared pair head into the jungle, and against long odds, do manage to locate Diana, living at religious sanctuary deep in the wilds, called the `unification village'.  The group is led by the charismatic Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov), who apparently keeps his subjects under control through the use of religion, intimidation, and drugs.  It is a bizarre situation, and Jonas who enjoys abusing women while they are under the influence, soon has Sheila naked and painted gold.  The jungle is infested with cannibals, who make escape from the village nearly impossible.  Butler finds this is true when he attempts an escape, only to be forced to return to the village by the ferocious blood thirsty cannibals.  Enlisting the help of a native woman (Me Me Lai), Butler comes up with a final ill-fated plan for escape.This version of director Umberto Lenzi's film runs just over 92 minutes long (not the 87 minutes stated on the back cover), and features some shocking scenes of brutality, where people are hacked up and consumed raw, in a most casual manner.  Whether realistic or not, there are few things as terrifying as being on the bottom of the food chain.  The cannibals function similar to a traditional monster, and are turned loose for best dramatic effect.  The religious cult element adds even more campy madness to the mix, pushing matters well over the top.  Jonas rules like an emperor, and he and many in his group, appear remarkably well groomed for living in the middle of a forest.  Sheila's makeup is always immaculate, and her clothes never seem to get dirty.  Butler, the supposed expert, isn't very successful at making his way in the jungle, yet manages to survive.In the cannibal film genre, this is perhaps one of the less `realistic' entries.  If you have a stout heart, and want some pretty raw thrills, you may want to check this out.  The extras include some interesting interviews with Umberto Lenzi, Robert Kerman, and Ivan Rasimov.  The film is also available as part of the Jungle Horrors Triple Feature, which also includes Jungle Holocaust and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.",Eaten Alive

Not purposely, but simply because life got in the way--raising a family, working two jobs, dealing with setbacks and disappointment, trying always to rise above the roadblocks, to make it all worthwhile, and even have some fun, along the way. There were years when my passion for reading took a back seat to being a wife, a mom, a part of the work force that keeps society moving, money in the bank account. Reading never stopped, but time became a luxury I often had to steal for an occasional book. Today, when I might have three books going at once, plus all the internet information I can devour, bliss is mine. Now, as I read To Kill a Mockingbird, I'm beyond sad that this feast was denied me so long. Given the current, woeful state of the world, of national politics, reading this book has provided me a deeper well of comprehension of racial realities of which I was aware, certainly, which offended me, throughout my life. But this small jewel of a book has cracked my mind open in a way nothing else ever has, driving home again the immense power of books to reveal, to define reality clearly, in yet another light. I will be giving this book as gifts for a very long time.",N/A
381696,"Roberto Benigni, who went to achieve international stardom with ""Life Is Beautiful,"" plays two roles in this comedy. The story is about an innocent man who is dead ringer for a gangster-informant-in hiding. Benigni plays both roles.It's a decent movie, a low-key comedy that has some funny moments but would have been much better had it been chopped down about 15 minutes. It tends to drag a bit during the second half. Benigni, as the ""wimp,"" is a very charming guy and one that's easy to root for, but the rest of the characters in the film are just so-so. It's odd to see the usually high-strung Benigni as a lower-key person, but I like it.Surprisingly, this is an ""R"" rated comedy, and that's because of the language. I rented this once, but would see it again on a Region 1 DVD.",Johnny Stecchino VHS

1068772,"this series, which pre-dates the first Star Wars trilogy by a few years, was, at the time, the finest quality sci-fi series ever imagined.  When viewing it today, some 35 years later, we can see the lack of special effects, and so forth...but I thought the effects were impressive, given the limitations back in the mid 70's (George Lucas would change all that with his Star Wars universe).  Hey, at least they tried, right?what is striking is the depth and density of the writing.  The writing is what makes the series believable; because, as already mentioned, the special effects have their limitations.  Martin Landau really anchors this series with fine acting as the leader of the group.

1012154,"I was impressed with Sweden`s own art house vampire film ""Let The Right One In"", so of course, I was very interested when I heard about ""Frostbitten"" (or Frostbiten according to the film's opening credits), Sweden`s first vampire movie. Directed by Anders Banke, the film is another vampire flick that blends quirky humor, visceral vampirism and genetics as its main premise. The film is a little flimsy if you talk about its plot but the movie is quite fun.Annika (Petra Nielsen) and her daughter Saga (Grete Hayneskold) had just moved into a snow-laden town somewhere in Sweden. Annika had accepted a position at a local hospital led by an enigmatic Doctor Beckert (Carl-Ake Eriksson). The area is currently experiencing a month-long lack of sunlight and abundance of polar weather. Meanwhile, a young cocky medical assistant named Sebastian (Jonas Carlstrom) steals a batch of red pills from Beckert's office, either out of curiosity or for a ""party favor"" for his friend Vega (Emma Aberg) isn't really clear. After Sebastian takes a red pill, he begins to feel a little sick and very odd; his senses become enhanced, he even begins to hear dogs talk and has gained an intolerance to normal food. Sebastian also finds that he is slowly developing a lust for blood...Let's see, ""Frostbitten"" isn't going to make my list of favorite vampire films but I have to admit the movie does have its charm. I guess the best way to describe the movie would be a collision of quirky comedy and blood-soaked adrenaline, it bounces around jump scares and comedy while maintaining a feeling of tension. The movie's plot is full of gaps and characterization is kept at a bare minimum. The ""30 Days of Night"" angle isn't really brought into play as much as I would have liked since this element only serves as a very minor ingredient to the film's plot. The film's central focus falls upon its teenage characters such as Sebastian, Vega and company who are out to have fun.Sebastian takes center stage as the first victim of the red pill. His slow transformation to a vampire pretty much sets the film's tone and I have to admit, the sequences really cracked me up. It comes off a little grim at times, as we see Sebastian trying to drink his household condiments (ketchup, milk, juice etc.) and finds that his body is rejecting them. The young man's meeting with his girlfriend's parents become rather humorous as her father is a minister and you can guess what happens when he hears him saying `grace' and gets fed with a trout cooked in garlic sauce. Yes, the film does have its charm and parts of it were very funny and entertaining.Sadly, the film has several plot missteps that I thought were just rather disappointing. The plot with our mysterious Dr. Beckert is a little underdeveloped that this subplot never becomes compelling or interesting. I also felt that the sequences with Beckert and Annika didn't match the tone of the rest of the film. In this area, the film feels rather episodic and lacked coherency in its script. I thought the movie was going to be a solid comedic bloodbath but this area just felt a little too forced. The Nazi angle at the beginning of the film didn't really reach any inherent gravity to the narrative; it feels rather insignificant. It does provide some background to the vampire named Maria and to Beckert, but the way it just becomes attached into the plot is very difficult to buy into. However, I liked Beckert's transformation sequence, I thought it was a good homage to old-school effects.""Frostbitten"" has a lot of things going on between the fun-hungry teenagers and the Annika-Beckert struggle and the film does have several editing tricks up its sleeve. It did hold my focus and I felt like I was watching one of your cheesy horror low-budget films. I guess this was what the director intended. The vampires are curiously very sensitive to light, they can be repelled by a copy machine and even by a car's powerful headlights. The vampires themselves have the superhuman qualities we see in most vampire movies; strong, fast and feral. The vampires can be killed by the usual traditional means. The film also does have very nice cinematography that accentuates the frozen environment. From the indoors and the outdoors, the film does have the right atmosphere.This Swedish vampire thriller relies on its visuals and brings the core of its story from genetic studies. I thought the transformation from human to vampire through the use of a pill is a little hard to buy into. The film is also very predictable and rather unoriginal; it also lacks innovation and feels very routine with its barefaced scares. To its credit, the film does have its charm and leanness; the film has enough vampire stunts, humor and bloody scenes to charm the horror fan. The film is amiable enough and accompanied by good visuals, ""Frostbitten"" can be fun when you're in the mood for a vampire movie with flamboyance and comedic allure.Recommended!

I also learned something.There's plenty to enjoy, from Gervais' offhanded and charming performance to the strong supporting cast, including hilarious small roles for Lowe and Fey plus terrific cameos by Jason Bateman, Christopher Guest and other Gervais stalwarts.Gervais plays screenwriter Mark, a ""chubby little loser"" who knows that the lovely Anna (Jennifer Garner) is out of his league as soon as they meet. She doesn't disabuse him of the notion. His life goes from bad to worse when he is sacked and faces the possibility of eviction.Desperation is the mother of invention, and the world's first lie is told when he convinces a bank teller that there is more money in his account than appears on her screen. He now has discovered the ability to bend a trusting world to his will.Gervais once again appears to be using comedy as therapy to work out his personal insecurities. His screen alter ego is consistently branded a fat, underachiever but you know the purpose of the film will be to celebrate the triumph of this underdog and ensure that he wins the love of a gorgeous woman.The obvious scenario unfolds with a ready wit and an engaging sense of playfulness.

How could anyone except a twisted maniac take a film as wonderful as the Neverending Story and produce a pile of rubbish like THIS as a sequel?I had read the negative reviews on here, and thought, could it really be that bad, or are reviewers just giving it the same treatment they did Part 2 because it has a few minor differences that can be overlooked with relative ease.Well, I'm afraid I have to fall in with the majority of reviewers in my opinions.  I found a copy at my local library where I checked it out for free, and MAN did it blow!  There was yet another kid playing Bastian, who apparently got tired of the dye job and is back to brunette.

He takes his usual Django Reinhart-inspired acoustic guitar style to reach deep into his soul to draw a high-level jazz performance out of his heart He swings like never before.Sharing the front-line with Willie and Wynton is the surprising leadership of Mickey Rafael, Willies harmonica players. Insteadof choosing to use a Little Walter ""Mississippi saxophone"" style or a straight harp country harp style, Rafael draws deep in his sould to pull out a Sonny Boy Williamson II style ""St. Louis"" trumpet sound which like Clark Terry and Miles Davis emphasized economy of notes and maximizes sound colors and feeling. His performance is so striking that the documentarian has to insert a short discussion of Mickey Rafaelto answer ""Who was that guy on harp?"" questons.I spent two hours a couple of years in Wynton's NY condo sipping on a glass of Armanac as we discussed Sonny Boy Williamson II's story and the institutionalized racism of the Mississippi delta.

1069006,"Season three of Lost sees the series travel far from its roots as a show about a small group stranded on an island after a horrific catastrophe. The thing is, the plots in this, ""the captivity season,"" are so fast-paced and enthrallingly good, it's not only forgivable, it's a great ride! Answering the season two cliffhanger's burning question of what the heck happens now, the third season takes off like a rocket with Jack, Sawyer and Claire captives of the sinister ""Others"" whose brief onscreen moments in seasons one and two never hinted at the extent to which this society is entrenched on the island, or how advanced the Others are. Season three travels in many directions and for once answers more questions than it raises: a rarity in Lost. It is also possibly the most tragic season, with the loss of one particular cast member somehow hitting harder than any of the many deaths in the show to date. The introduction of Juliet Burke, the quiet, unflinchingly pragmatic fertility doctor and oft-dubbed ""scariest person ever on Lost"" was probably the highlight of the season, though the fault lines developing among the loyalties of the original Oceanic survivors brought out a soap operatic quality that was one more reason to tune in. Among the special features, the most winsome is probably Evangeline Lilly's behind the scenes moments with the numerous vital but seldom seen crewmembers whose labor brings Lost to the screen.

1125329,"Ford - a name associated with the last days of Jesse James and the stuff of many a hateful ballad. Why? Because Ford was once hailed as a hero when he pushed a bullet into the skull of Jesse James, only to be later labelled a coward because of many an aspect. First there was the way that Jesse died - a bullet to the back of the head - and the way the media sought to portray the outlaw. Much like many of the people in his day, the outlaw had become bigger than life and, though a killer amongst other things, he was - as the film points out - looked at with the same wonder that one would show the wonders of the world. Second, Jesse still had a following in the states that felt that they should have fought on in the Civil War. Added to that was the fact that Pinkertons raided the family farmhouse and cost his mother an arm, that he was constantly hounded and the price seemed to go skyward as he slipped noose after noose, and that he had a proclivity for killing ""old friends"" that he saw as threats and you had a legend. When this legend died at the hands of robert Ford, a seeming piece of backdrop on Jesse Jame's stage, and you had yourself a tale rife with villiany. Never ind the deeds of his past - he was an icon. so much so, in fact, that Ford's killer was - as the movie again pointed out - pardoned for the crime after serving only a dose of his lifelong sentence.It seemed like someone like Robert Ford was not good enough to kill someone like Jesse in the eyes of the public.The movie picks up in the brittle places where Jesse and death are closing in on one another, and it seems as though Jesse knows what is coming. It takes us through the struggles that Jesse has in maintaining the mask of sanity that barely fit him to begin with, showing us the actions of a person who almost seemed to have a deathwish. It also throws in the players in this dance that sets around the man, with Jesse finding himself listening to rumors and fearing even those closest to him. enter the deaths of many of the people he rode with, and the two Fords that would ultimately bring about his demise.What i liked about this movie was the fact that Robert ford was not ignored in this movie (although the portrayal of Jesse was hard to stop watching), and that he wasn't classified as a simpleton or some sort of screw-up. He was simply a person doing what he thought was right, and that was emulating the person he looked up to most in the world. The problem was that this person, Jesse, wronged him in ways both subtle and in crowds, and he and Charlie Ford began noticing what was happening all around them. Robert wanted to be as big as Jesse, but he also wanted to live long enough to see past his 21st birthday. On that death day, the things played out in a way that made me wonder if Jesse didn't want to have a gunfight in a house filled with his family, or if he was just tired and he kind of liked the kid that he picked on. Granted, this was a movie and answers seldom come from movies, but this thing was something I liked when I watched it.If you are loking for gunfighting and a lot of action, then look for another Jesse James movie. This is the last days of Jesse and is focused on Robert Ford, not the James Gang. This means that you have a lot of thought and wonderment, a lot of disappointment and fear, and a lot of disillusionment when the world didn't applaud his last move. It is a great piece historically speaking, however, even if there are errors here and there. I personally think that it is watchable for crowds of people that know what they are in for - a character-piece that is slowly driven and that gives you a lot of each person in the film. It was different, too, and the artistic way it danced made me like it AFTEr i saw it more than once.Recommended - but with a cautionary motion to say that the film is either great or boring for its viewer.",N/A

One of them decides to make her their private sex slave. The other does not. Then they discover she cannot die (even after one of them shoots her). So they keep her. One teen keeps using her while the other goes on to have conscience problems.But there are capital problems here that prevent such premise from blooming into a great one-of-a-kind film.The first thing that strikes me is the miscasting of 25y/o actors who look like 25y/o men and trying to make me believe they are 17y/o teens. That is one major thing that makes this film look quite ridiculous. So you have some 25y/o men dressed as teens and behaving like teens. For me it is hard to buy. I'm sure there are lots of 17y/o teens who would make this film really disturbing.The second big problem here is the script. It is talky and talky and talky. I have nothing against talky scripts but here I kept asking myself ""won't this film advance to the next scene, please?"". Then I realized this film only had story for 40 minutes. The rest of it was filling the void with slow pace.Plus, there are lots of implausible storytelling elements that makes the film progressively harder to like. For me this is a film that does not know what it is - and disguises itself as ""Daringly original and genre-busting (...) odyssey into the soul of our alienated youth that takes the conventions of the horror and coming-of-age movies and turns them on their heads"".No it's not.

There are some interesting action scenes, like flying missile drones chasing snowmobiles, but it seems to swing from expensive FX scenes, to grim, urban, post apocalypse scenes, which would be fine, except there are no zombies. If you're going to have monochrome gray post-apocalypse scenes you need zombies, unless you're doing a Eastern European love story, in which case, you need zombies shagging. The whole thing could have been shot in black and white and you'd have never noticed the difference.The upside is that you do get to see Vin Diesel growl at people and blow stuff up, which I think we've all missed.",N/A

53574,"The 2008 special edition of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" brings to modern audiences the spine-chilling thrills of the original plus a great deal more.  The digitally remastered print is impeccable and enables viewers to appreciate the set design; the chiaroscuro lighting in which sharp contrasts between light and dark add to the atmosphere of impending doom; and the amazing performances of the leads and the supporting cast.  The brilliant Anthony Perkins fully inhabits Norman Bates's character and, for reasons that defy understanding, did not receive an Academy Award nomination as best actor.  Also snubbed by the Academy was Bernard Hermann, whose iconic score was played entirely on stringed instruments.  Every scene featuring Hermann's music is enhanced by it, especially the famous shower sequence that had audiences in 1960 screaming their heads off.  The wonderful Janet Leigh was nominated for her believable portrayal of Marion Crane, an ordinary woman desperate to make a life for herself with the hunky John Gavin. Martin Balsam, a savvy character actor, is a private detective hired to track down Marion when she disappears.  Vera Miles, Crane's sister, Lila, aggressively pursues any clue that will help her find Marion.  Ultimately, however, Perkins's performance is the one that everyone remembers.  His stuttering speech, darting eyes, birdlike movements, ghoulish taxidermy hobby, nervous munching, and references to his overbearing mother all combine to create a character for the ages.Everything about this movie is carefully thought out and beautifully realized.  Hitchcock planned every frame in advance, hired a talented and creative screenwriter, Joseph Stefano, a wonderful cinematographer, John Russell, and a skilled film editor, George Tomasini.  The cast and crew worked tirelessly to put Hitchcock's vision on the screen.  The shower scene alone took seven days to complete.  The result is a terrifying and mesmerizing film that explores such themes as voyeurism, dysfunctional relationships, bad choices that wreck our lives, and the secrets and lies that entrap even the most average people.The extras are eye-opening.  They include informative feature commentary delivered by Stephen Rebello, author of ""Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho.""  Rebello helps us appreciate Hitchcock's ability to get around the stringent censorship code, his groundbreaking use of camera angles, and his juxtaposition of wry humor and horrific violence. In addition, the late Janet Leigh tells us how much she loved working with ""Mr. Hitchcock,"" whom she respected greatly; she was happy to do whatever he asked of her.  Stefano found Hitchcock to be warm and approachable, not at all a cold and forbidding auteur.  We also hear from Hitchcock's daughter, Pat, and his assistant director, who notes Hitchcock's close attention to every detail, including lighting, set design, and special effects.  In addition, there is archival footage of hundreds of people waiting on long lines to get into the film when it was first released, since no one was admitted after the show began.  This gimmick inflamed people's curiosity and helped make ""Psycho"" a box office bonanza.  Hitchcock's legacy is discussed  by such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, who admits that he has frequently paid homage to Hitchcock, whom he considers to be one of the most imitated directors of all time.  This superb two-disc set is a must-see for fans of ""Psycho.""  Just one bit of advice:  Don't watch it while you are in the house alone.",N/A

1213248,"One of the things I love about this DVD is the PRE-SET workouts...it has a BEGINNER'S CARDIO PLUS(49:30), YOGA ONLY PRE-SET(42:30)(this one is great if you only want to do the yoga parts of the DVD and not the cardio), KUNDALINI CARDIO PLUS SUPERSET(49:30), AND KUNDALINI YOGA PLUS CARDIO INTERMEDIATE(61:00). It also has the MATRIX menu, if you want to design your own workout.I felt really good after this workout. It's really nice because it has yoga segments and cardio as well. So, it's like getting two DVD's in one. It felt fantastic and I had more energy afterwards. The warm-up, stretching, core work, and upper body work felt great emotionally and physically and the Cardio segment really makes your heart shine...I felt invigorated and really bright and happy afterwards.(and it gave me a good sweat too!) Great for getting negative energy out! The music is really energizing too and Ana looks absolutely amazing...good inspiration to look at. I believe this DVD will really help people to feel more confident physically and emotionally and have more energy and happiness. After doing this DVD, you cannot feel depressed or stagnant! And for those of you who aren't really into cardio or have a hard time getting started on cardio things, this Cardio segment goes really fast and is set up to not be too much of any one movement at a time. My heart is going to love me for doing this for it! I could practically hear it thanking me. cardio is an area that was lacking in my exercise regimen, but this makes it so easy to get it in, in a short time too! This DVD is going to make it easy for people to work their entire body and mind too.If you do the DVD start to finish, it runs:TUNE-IN:(1:50)WARM-UPS:(5:13)-while sitting cross-legged...spinal grinds, flexing spine with arm movement, twisting motion from torso with arms at right angles, seated with legs straight reaching fingertips to opposite toes.STRETCHING PLUS CORE(15:32) and CORE PLUS(7:44)-seated forward bend with one leg under you with breath of fire(this is done for several minutes), plough exercise(legs straight on floor then into plough), yoga sit-ups(lying on back, legs straight, rolling up and bending knees at the same time), then combining the plough exercise with the yoga-sit-up, rock on spine, then on hands and knees pumping one leg at a time out straight behind you, then on back raising head while stretching legs open to the side, then lying on back feet stacked on top of one another and you raise your head-first with regular breath then with breath of fire. rock on spine again, then locust pose with breath of fire.KUNDALINI CARDIO WARM-UP FLOW AND KUNDALINI CARDIO:(15:02)- the warm-up starts with gentle, flowing, and wave-like movements while standing. The cardio dance segment alternates with some gentle cardio and then 30 second moments of intensity. (the movements are different, by the way, from their ""Dance the Chakras"" workout.) There is a Football Drill, where you run in place really fast. A couple different jumping jacks(with modifications, though, so you don't have to jump if you can't or don't want to). There's some dance steps and movements(one where you move in a circle like you're paddling your canoe). It all really gets your heart going, but it's not overwhelming, because the intense moments are only in 30 second intervals and then you do a move that is more low-key.KUNDALINI CARDIO COOL-DOWN(3:16)- gentle movements and stretchingUPPER BODY TUNE AND TONE(11:39)- in down dog on forearms w/ hands clasped moving forward and back over your hands..then doing this movement with one leg raised. sitting cross-legged raising one arm up and down in front of you, then both arms. Then hold arms in front of you 10 degrees above parallel with long deep breathing. exercise with arms out to side then over head. then arms in prayer pose over head straightening and bending arms.DEEP RELAXATION:(5:17)- I almost fell asleep during this part..I got so relaxed!EK ONG KAR CHANT:(5:19)-singing a chant(but it's a different melody than the Ek Ong Kar one on their AM/PM DVD.CLOSING PRAYER:(2:43)BREATH PRIMER:(5:30)-does a breath of 4 parts inhale, 4 parts exhale(I think this was called Energy Breath on their other 2 new DVD's), then long deep breathing, then Breath of Fire.DANCE MOVEMENT BREAKDOWN:(7:51)- this breaks down the movements in the Cardio section, doing them in slow motion with more voice instruction.EXTENDED DANCE:(21:00)- this is the same as the Cardio segment, but done longer, for when you want to really get your heart up.DANCE WITH MUSIC ONLY:(10:47)- the Cardio segment with music and Ana dancing, but no voice-over.","Kundalini Yoga Cardio, Stretch, & Strengthen - ALL LEVELS - Ana Brett and Ravi Singh"

The two guys disappear within five minutes of the opening credits leaving the boy in the center to his own devices and mainly to face imaginary monsters of his own making.There is no conflict to speak of. The main hero apparently believes that his more adult friends (who left for Christmas to spend it with the family of one of them) intend to replace him with a younger specimen of the same breed and plans to commit a spectacular suicide so that his companions could know what harm they made.Unfortunately, the whole story (hardly credible from the very beginning) is played rather badly so instead of a story we get a sequence of scenes in which our hero tries to drown his pain in mindless sex. At least there is sex but be forewarned - the adjective mindless was fully intended. And it applies to more than just sex.In case you refused to listen to this (or any other) review, and then fell asleep or switched the video off halfway through the movie (warning: spoiler follows!) there is a happy ending.

McDormand gives a touching performance as the dour Miss Pettigrew who is drawn willy-nilly into Delysia's dizzying and improper life. Adams' bubbly effervescence accommodates moments of fear, self-awareness and pathos as Delysia reveals her vulnerability.

345720,"This is a horror masterpiece, and it has hardly aged even after being released in 1974. This film was so controversial when it was released it was banned in countries like Britain for several years. This film still gets under your skin and makes you afraid because all of this could very well happen. While most critics praised this film, there were some (Ahem, Roger Ebert) who did not like it for its gruesome violence and unflinching take on horror films. If you love horror films you must see this film and experience true horror.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Five friends; Sally, Franklin, Jerry, Pam, and Kirk decide to go visit an old house in which Sally and Franklin's grandparents used to live, while stopping by an old cemetary to see if their grandparents have been dug up because of recent reports of grave robbing. On their way to the house after visiting the cemetary, they pick up a hitchhiker who turns out to be crazy and assaults Franklin, and is immediately thrown out of the van. They get to the old abandoned and they're having fun for the most part, until Kirk and Pam wander off by themselves and find a strange house. When Kirk wanders inside, he is killed by Leatherface, the main antagonist in the film, and Pam is kidnapped and stuck on a hook. Quickly, the other three realize something is wrong when the other two don't return, and find out they are being hunted by a family of serial killers who decorate their home with bones and body parts from animals and people, and they also like to eat people. Now the group must try and survive and not be killed by this family.MUSIC: The music in this film is very bizarre, yet it fits the raw and uncompromising mood of such a violent and disturbing film. It takes some time to get used to, but once you do, it fits very well.ACTION: This film isn't so much about gore as it is about shocking you with disturbing imagery. This is still very scary and horrifying even after 35 years. However, that's still not to say that this film isn't gory, because it really is at times. This film will gross you out and send chills down your spine.ACTING: Surprisingly, these actors were pretty good for people who were hired out of the Texas area where the film was shot. Marilyn Burns delivers one of the best performances in horror film history, and she does make you know that's she terrified and she seems very real. She is quite simply, brilliant to say the least. Props to this area.OVERALL: If you have not seen this horror classic, then you must. It will still scare the hell out of you and it will still horrify you with shocking imagery. This package also includes a second disc which delves deep into the making of this film. It's an excellent package for an excellent film. This horror film is simply superb, and Roger Ebert and his 2 out of 4 star rating of this film can go to hell along with anyone else who complains about the violence in this film or says it's boring.THE GOOD: Disturbing, scary, gory, good music, great acting, and it feels very real in every way.THE BAD: Slow beginning and a few moments of cheesy acting.",N/A

1236556,"Wow. That this is a scary film is undeniable. To say that is is compelling and worthy of our attention is an understatement.Maybe people have their doubts about the predictions of Nostradamus, and this is understandable. I mean, how many of us really want to entertain the belief that the world, at least as we know it, is coming to an end in 2012? We would rather put our heads in the sand and tell ourselves that it could never happen -- at least in our lifetime. If we are in doubt about this particular prediction, we should examine the quatrains that he wrote predicting other world events. If none of them have occurred, then perhaps we can cease worrying. As Sherlock Holmes would say, let's look at the facts. Of course, we might also argue that his quatrains are so obscure at to be open to numerous interpretations, as are the many signs around the world which are subject to being decoded according to separate perspectives. Did he, as some have claimed, predict 9-11? Did he predict Hurricane Katrina and global warming?As this film points out, however, we cannot put all of this into the lap of the famous seer who lived at a time when making such predictions could put one in danger of being burned at the stake as a heretic. One did not then go against the beliefs and teachings of the Church. The Lollards, for example, often were burned at the stake like William Tyndale for merely wanting a version of the Holy Word in English instead of Latin. The Church in Rome opposed this because they feared a loss of control over the semi-educated masses in England. This film, to its credit, draws our attention not only to Nostradamus and to The Revelations of St. John in the Bible but to other prophecies that have been made since early times by the underrated star-gazing Mayans, the Egyptians, and the Hopis as well.Many people will have their own opinions about this program, so it is unlikely that anything I write will change their personal views. Some find it funny; some believe it is inaccurate. Many may even think it is foolish to look around to see what we are doing to our own planet. They will dismiss this, perhaps, as easily as they dismiss such films as THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, based on Whitley Streiber's and Art Bell's book THE COMING SUPERSTORM, as being only fiction.As my brother stated, this planet is a living entity and will, he believes, protect itself, even if it means disgorging itself of the beings that are inhabiting it and abusing it. My own suggestion would be to examine other books and DVDs on this topic now available through Amazon and to arrive at your own conclusions. If you can find a place to hide from our transgressions, then do so. Book a ticket to a flight away from here, or hope that some friendly aliens will rescue some of us, as is shown in the fictional film KNOWING. Some experts, if we wish to call them such, believe that this world will indeed undergo some dramatic changes, but that not all of us will necessarily perish. What we supposedly will see will be a new world, maybe one -- if the optimists are correct -- that will be occupied by people who don't feel the need to destroy each other and the very planet that has supported us for eons.If I have any complaints about this program, it would be that it lacks subtitles. Because I teach students whose first language is not English, it is a small detriment. That said, I cannot help but wonder how many teachers would actually show this program to their students. I wonder if do so would put them in jeopardy with school boards and administrators, even at colleges. Might they be treated to a modern version of being burned at the stake -- i.e., terminated -- their teaching contracts, I mean?",Nostradamus: 2012
956974,"Miyazaki is probably the greatest anime director ever; point taken. He can't do a bad job and always creates wonderful and interesting works. This one isn't an exception, it's a good anime film with wonderful art, animation and an imagination beyond limits. But although I love Miyazaki's work, this isn't one of his best works.For fleshing out his story he would need at least more half an hour of animation, there are too many loose ends or unexplained events in this film, and it deviates so much from the original novel that it's only very loosely based on it (and I sincerely think that it should be made that remark at the beginning or end of the movie).Compared with princess mononoke's characters, Sophie, Howl, Suliman or the Witch of the Waste are completely bi-dimensional! For example the Witch curses Sophie with a terribly monstrous curse with absolutely no reason (if she wanted a spy there would be millions of easier ways) and next time they meet they are almost friendly, Sophie asks her to remove the curse; the witch says she can't; then O.K. no big deal, let's help the poor overweight woman!!!! There is no consequence for the actions  formerly made. Also the Deux ex machina is quite abusive; especially the way Sophie finds Howls Castle.Many loose ends, if worked on, could had created a marvellous story. For example, Howl avoids at all costs being involved in the war, but for some unexplained reason he is always flying over the battlefields; this could lead to an excellent side plot but remains unexplored.It is a truly simple story, and very nice and uplifting tale; the image backgrounds are astonishing and the XIX century look mixed with magic and science is fantastic. But there is a lack of character motivations, too many coincidences, everybody is so simple, so good natured, everything can be worked out with a simple phrase ""lets be friends"" or a smile (from selling the soul, to loosing 60 years of life, almost being killed or ending a war!)...I believe you should watch this tale and be awed with the art, but not expecting a great story or unforgettable characters.",N/A

The matches are whole though(There are some matches that are just clips like the Kurt Angle/Brock Lesnar Iron Man match, Eddie Guerrero vs John Cena Parking lot brawl, and some others)The clips and full matches are done in a top 100 countdown style. Even though segments aren't whole, it is still a decent DVD though. I have to give this DVD 3 out 5 stars, Mostly because of the matches and some of the highlights they show are for segments and matches I totally forgot about(Like Tazz vs Triple H match) or, segments I enjoyed when I first saw them back in the day and it's fun to relive them.

351931,"Anyone who appreciates the films of Douglas Sirk will appreciate this superb melodrama, seething with fear, guilt, sex, and retribution.  Stanwyck and Douglas are perfect as a venomous married couple bound together by a guilty secret.  Heflin and Scott are good as well.  Rossen's script and Milestone's direction are brilliant and precisely calibrated to be just over-the-top enough to suit the feverish story.  The plot is totally unpredictable with scene after scene chock-full of surprising twists and tough, memorable dialogue.My only criticisms would be the awful title (don't know who came up with that clunker) and the violent scenes, which are a bit hokey, thanks to the censorship of the period.  The killing of the aunt should shock us, not look a bit silly -- but realistic violence was not permitted in movies at this time.  (Which was not such a bad thing, considering the tedious bloodbaths we've been subjected to since the fall of censorship.)The complexity of these characters, and the emotional intensity of their interactions, are unforgettable.  When Stanwyck's icy composure breaks down, over the campfire, her desperation is so naked and real, you almost gasp.If you're the type of viewer who doesn't care for stories that focus on women, or films that ratchet up the emotional intensity to extreme levels, stay away.

1026818,"Warning...spoilersThis is an intriguing movie.  I normally don't like films that are all dialogue, but ""Conversations with Other Women"" hooked me pretty quickly.  I think it's all down to the fact that Helena Bonham-Carter and Aaron Eckhart having a great deal of charisma and chemistry together and the fact that the dialogue rings true and sparkles.As for the split screen depiction, initially I found myself hoping it would go away, but once I settled into the movie, I didn't mind it and thought it sometimes added to the story (but it would be interesting to see a version where most everything was done on one screen).Turning to the story, it's pretty simple.  Bonham-Carter and Eckhart meet at a wedding.  At first, they way they talk, you would think they don't know each other.  But then you start to realize and the film reveals that they were once married and that marriage ended with Bonham-Carter's character packing up and moving to London and marrying an older man.  Eventually, the two (ex)lovers retire to her hotel room and have sex and talk about the past and the future.I think it's a testimony to the chemistry that the two stars have and the dialogue of the film that I did not find their actions sleazy or reprehensible (Bonham-Carter's character cheating on her husband and Eckhart cheating on his much younger girlfriend).  Through their conversations and the flashbacks shown on the split screen, we see just how much love and passion once existed between them.  I'm left with the opinion that their divorce happened so quickly and they were cut off from each other so rapidly, their love didn't die but just went on hiatus...only to come back at full burn when they met again at the wedding.I'm left wondering what would happen after the story ended.  Frankly, it's hard to see how either of them could have just gone back to where they were before (for example, Bonham-Carter's character's protestations that she's happy in her life in London ring false...and Eckhart makes it very clear that he never got over her).  I'd like to think that in the fictional world where these two lovers exist, Bonham-Carter's character did return to London and wound up her marriage there before coming back to Eckhart's character in New York.  I couldn't help but notice that the split screen finally united at the very end of the movie and perhaps that symbolizes a hopeful future.The movie isn't perfect.  I thought that a bit of the sex scene in the hotel was rather graphic (not for me, but older and more conservative people would probably be put off by it).  Also, the idea that the two characters would have identical cell phones that would allow Bonham-Carter's character to answer a call from Eckhart's girlfriend seemed a bit improbable (as did the idea that the girlfriend would not have instantly realized why this had happened).  But those aren't significant enough flaws to take away from the rewarding experience that watching the film was for me (and I bought a copy from amazon.com right before posting this).",Conversation(s) With Other Women
1275694,"The film, ""Shank"" was one of the offerings at the 14th Annual Gay and Lesbian Film Festival at the Carolina Theater in Durham, NC from August 13th through August 16th, 2009.  It was not an easy film to watch because it depicted gang members who spent their days drinking and using drugs and filling their nights as a group picking out gay men who happened to be alone and defenseless, beating them senseless just for fun.  In that gang was a young man named Cal who was a closeted gay man fighting it with everything he was worth.  The problem was, he was in love with the defacto-leader of the gang, so much so that the desires he felt had bubbled up from their depths and in spite of himself, he found himself seeking out ways to meet those needs with strange men.  The tightrope he had to walk was this: meet those desires but at all costs never let the gang discover he was doing it.  He was so conflicted that after he would give in to his desires, he would become physically sick and woe to any man who happened to be his pickup if he assumed after the incident that Cal was gay.One night, the prey that the gang selected for their gay bashing was a young college student and before the beating completely got out of hand, Cal stopped it surprising both the gang members and the victim, as well as himself.  The victim, Oliver, was so thankful to Cal for saving him, he brought him home and treated him nicely giving Cal his first opportunity to have a decent relationship.  But, the gang members couldn't let Cal drop out of the gang.  That would be treason and would require revenge, so as each day passed they planned and plotted to win him back, but that was before they discovered his secret.  When they found out what Cal had been up to, pay-back was required and a scheme that would outrank anything they had ever done began to take shape.Again, it was not an easy movie to watch but we need to see these kind of films to be reminded that there are places in this world where gays and lesbians are not safe without others to back us up.  And don't be fooled that America is exempt from this hatred (it has only been a few short years since the incident of Matthew Shepherd occurred).  Many hate us and would rather see us dead or never born than to see us walking around gay and proud.But, back to the film itself and what I think made it not just a good movie but a great one.  Near the end of the film there was a scene where no words were spoken.  Two actions were taken by two of the characters in the film one of which was a request for forgiveness and the other was a granting of that request.  The scene simply accomplished what the most elaborate words could have never achieved.  It was a scene that will live forever in my memory.  Rent the DVD when it comes out in October and see if you can pick out the scene I'm talking about.",N/A
544891,"I  bought  this  DVD  about  5  years  ago  when  I  have  not  seen  this  movie  until  I  brought  it  home  and  sliped  it  in  my  playstation 2. Because  of  2  reason. 1) none  of  my  local  video  stores  don't  have  a  copy  of  this  movie  on  their  shelfs and  2)  This  movie  is  not shown  on  any  of  the  cable  networks.  This  is  not a  bad  movie. This  movie  is about  Bill  Murray  playing  a  famouse  person  named  Hunter  S. Thomson  who  was  a  famous  journlist  who  attended  famous  events  and  wrote  a  journl  on  the  famouse  events  and  coverage  like  the  1972  superbowl  game  and  some  on  Richard  Nixon. What  make  this  movie  so  interesting  is  that  like  I  said  is  its  about  Hunter  S  Thompson  life  and  its  shows  you  what  his  life  was  like  and  what  he  did  when  he  was  doing  or  writing  any  coverage. Like  when  he  was  at  the  hotel  on  the  weekend  of  the  1972  superbowl  game,  he  crash  and  distroyed  the  hotel  room  and  invited  everyone  into  his  room  and  threw  a  wild  party. Its  like  he  invited  you  into  his  personal  life  when  you  watch  this  movie. I  don't  think  that  the  real  Hunter  S  Thomson  wanted  it  that  way  or  I  don't  that  Bill  Murray  ever  had  the  time  to  be  with  him  or  got  to  know  more  about  him,  or  its  has  do  with  Bill  Murray  spending  the  summer  at  Camps  white  Pine& Towhee  in  Canada  where  they  were filming  Meatballs  at  the  time,and  he  was  too  busy  preparing  for  his  Tripper role. I  think  that  was  problem. In  1997,  Johnny  Depp  spend  a  year  sleeping  in  Hunter  basement  so  he  can  learn  alote  about  Hunter  so  he  can  play  him  better  when  they  were  filming  Fear  and  loathing  in  Las  Vegas. Now  some  of  you  think  Hunter  S  Thomson  was  off  the  walls  or  acting  a  little  bit  wild.  Well  thats  because  he  was  on  drugs  alote,  and  if  they  could  do  a  PG  rated  verson  of  this  movie  without  the  bad  laguage  and  the  hard  sex. This  movie  would  set  them  straight  and  show  them  what  kind  of  drugs  can  do  to  them. My  faviort  seen  in  the  movie  is  where  Hunter  and  Lazlo  are  in  the  car  driving  on  some  rocky  road, Hunter  is  toppless  and  pick  up  this  Hippy  hitchicker, and  the  hitchiker  gets  in  the  car. And  Then  Hunter  gets  out  the  gun  and  ams  at  the  hitchiker  passenger  and  then  shots  out  the  car  window. That  Part  made  me  laught. And  as  for  the  rest  of  the  film. I give  it  a  good  laught  and  importain  message. Buy  this  movie  and  it  will  keep  you  entertain  for  hours,  and  what  ever  you  do,  don't  ever  ever  do  what  Hunter  did  in  real  life, and  that  is  DRUGS.Trivia1.The  scean  where  Hunter  and  Lazlo  are driving  on  one  the  streets  in  San Francisco  and  you  will  see  a  wall  that  says  Fear  and  loathing  in  Las  Vegas  written  in  graffitti.2. Neil  Young  had  a  small  role  in  the  movie,  he  playes  one  of  the  jury  members  when  Lazlo  ahs  to  attend  one  of  his  trails.3.

713008,"Probably the most well-known fictional detective, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, has over the years been the subject of films, radio serials, and a few television programs.  On British television during the 1954-55 season, Sheldon Reynold's presentation of the famous sleuth, is pretty good entertainment, as in the half hour format, things generally develop quickly, and proceed in a straightforward manner.  Sherlock Holmes (Ronald Howard) and his friend, roommate and chronicler, Dr. John Watson (Howard Marion-Crawford), are almost exclusively involved in new original adventures, not directly taken from the writings of Conan Doyle.  The stories include the familiar matters of crime, murder, mystery, and missing persons.The fictional Holmes was a consulting detective, who often had clients call on him at his 221B Baker Street flat.  Besides getting involved in cases in this traditional way, here Holmes and Watson are often quickly immersed in an adventure due to their close relationship with Inspector Lestrade (Archie Duncan) of Scotland Yard.  Although early on, the Inspector's presence may shift the focus a bit from the Holmes/Watson relationship (which does take a while to gel), the police connection does facilitate quicker story development.One of the most interesting aspects of the series is that except for `The Red Headed League', these adventures are not directly based on Conan Doyle's stories.  The adaptation of the characters is mostly well done.  Holmes and Watson appear in new situations, but they are still on very familiar ground, and do not seem at all out of place.  These tales range far and wide, and take place during the early days, when Watson and Holmes roomed together, and appear to be set close to the character's original timeline (approximately 1881 to 1914), unlike the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce films, where Holmes got involved in contemporary events like World War II.  For many, these 50 year old programs will be fresh `new' adventures.Conan Doyle's Holmes was a gentleman, but at times he could be overconfident, arrogant, single-minded, morose, and a substance abuser.  He was also quite passionate when faced with evil.  In the classic films, Basil Rathbone explored the character's darker side, and brought an edge to the character, that probably would not have played well on television in the 50's.  Howard's low key portrayal of Holmes, which avoids displaying the negative aspects, was probably appropriate for television.  Marion-Crawford as Watson, is loyal, tough, and ready to charge into action at a moments notice, not quite the amiable, quasi-bumbling sidekick that Nigel Bruce was.In this series, Holmes's talent as a master of disguise is exploited a bit for entertainment purposes, with Watson getting into the act as well.  The portrayal of these classic characters is mostly enjoyable, although Ronald Howard may not replace Rathbone or Jeremy Brett as your favorite Holmes.  Uncharacteristically, Howard's Holmes often fails to assert himself whenever a physical confrontation occurs, usually leaving Watson to deal with the situation.  Howard is quite adept at ducking for cover, then popping up after the danger has past.  This lack of backbone takes some getting used to, as the real Holmes was no wallflower.Things get very personal in `The Christmas Pudding', when a criminal sentenced to die, escapes from prison to make good on his threat to kill Holmes.  This episode is suspenseful and edgy, but when Holmes fails to take action and subdue the criminal, that leaves an unarmed Watson to face a man with a gun.  There is more inaction from Holmes in `The Case of the Deadly Prophecy', where Holmes stands frozen, while Watson wrestles with a man with a gun.  In `The Case of the Singing Violin', Holmes somehow gets locked in a closet at a key moment.  Meekly pounding on the door and muttering threats, while Watson faces an armed killer.  Why the writers emasculated the character in moments of crisis like this, is a mystery in itself.  The real Holmes had boxing experience, yet in `The Baker Street Nursemaids' (written by Sheldon Reynolds) it is Watson who is giving a rather prissy Holmes, tips on how to throw a punch.  In some of the later episodes, Holmes finally starts to display more gumption, as in `The Case of the Royal Murder', which features Holmes engaged in some swashbuckling swordplay.Holmes' failure at times to `man up' is troubling, but in spite of this, the stories are still compelling for the most part.  Creative stories like `The Case of the Laughing Mummy', feature some interesting detective work, and exotic methods for murder.  Holmes usually is at his best, when he is up against true evil, as in `The Case of the Perfect Husband', which features a psychopathic serial killer, and an over the top ending.  `The Case of the Jolly Hangman' features a particularly cold-hearted scheming murderer, and in the suspenseful `The Case of the Bind Man's Bluff', Holmes matches wits with a classic revenge killer.The supposedly `remastered' black and white episodes vary in quality, but are generally average at best, in picture and sound quality.  It's understandable given their age, and almost every other episode has audio issues.  The cost for the 39 half hour episodes, on three single sided discs, is a real bargain.  For fans of Sherlock Holmes, or the early days of British television, this collection is very worthy of consideration.  The program is not appropriate for young children, due to the mature subject matter, and some violence.",N/A

56467,"This is very popular movie in its day in which I saw twice at the theater!  Years later, watching it on DVD wasn't the same. Oh, it was still funny but just not the ""hilarious"" movie I always remembered it as. Maybe its reputation and memory exceeded its value, or maybe it's funnier when you are younger.  The movie didn't change; I must have.Whatever, there is still a lot of good laughs in year, subtle and slapstick variety. Now I laugh more at the subtle things. Almost all the characters in here, beginning with Steve Martin's ""Navin R. Johnson,"" are totally wacky. Bernadette Peters, by the way, never looked prettier.This was in the earlier days of the ratings system and that PG rating would be at least PG-13 today. It still fun to see it after a long absence.

1203675,"I have had an interest in seeing this movie since it came out for two reasons. The hype and the fact that I LOVE vampire movies. I can say, after finally seeing it, that it was terribly over-hyped and as a vampire flick? Terrible.These are not your run of the mill vampires. And I knew that before I saw it. They do not die in the sunlight. They do not have fangs. All in all, they're just cold, strong and fast humans. The only thing that REALLY connects them with the ""classic"" vampires is their thirst for blood, which isn't really a big thing in the movie either. If Edward did not look at her neck longingly with the occasional mention of wanting her blood, you'd never really know.As for the love story of the movie. The pacing is terrible. They meet in class and do not even speak to one another. They have few interactions where they actually talk. Next thing you know, they're confessing their love for each other. No development there. It's like they just decided during one of their brief walk by conversations to be in love.I suppose if you're a die-hard fan of the books, you may appreciate the movie. If you're looking for a vampire movie, or a movie with any substance for that matter, stay away from this one.",N/A
1246351,"As with most of today's movies in the horror genre, this one has plenty of gore for fans. The storyline was not as predictable as I thought, but the acting destroyed the movie for me; along with the cheesy special effects. Kane Hodder today's superstar boogeyman, was at least interesting to watch without a hockey mask or distorted makeup. The lead, Alison Brie, just isn't strong enough to carry the movie, particularly a bad one. Veteran Denise Crosby has done better work. Actually, she is the only good performance in the movie next to Hodder.I don't recommend this film. The explicit use of gore is used as a substitute for tension and interest from a shoddy script. The scenes with the heroine talking for the demonic baby are unintentionally campy and hilarious.I'm glad I rented it for only a buck. Otherwise, I would have felt really cheated.I gave it one star because Amazon has nothing lower. A total zero.",Born

1102342,"**1/2Recent college grad Annie Braddock (Scarlett Johansson) is all set for a career in business when she quite literally falls into a position as nanny for the four-year-old son (Nicholas Art) of a snooty, self-absorbed Upper East Side socialite named Alexandra X, played by a sadly miscast Laura Linney (among many of the movie`s wearisomely cutesy touches is not giving a surname to the family that hires her).Based on the novel by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus, ""The Nanny Diaries"" is, unfortunately, every bit as predictable and trite as its simpleminded premise would lead one to expect.  Beyond trafficking in just about every stereotype and clich&eacute; imaginable - the heartless, neurotic, slave-driving elitists; the sensitive knight-in-shining armor love interest (Chris Evans); the nagging, free-living best friend; the lecherous, nanny-chasing husband (Paul Giamatti) - the movie is woefully unsuccessful even at treading that fine line between cleverness and cuteness that can make or break a film of this type.  There is an affectionate tribute to ""Mary Poppins"" that - early on at least - suggests that the movie might actually try to do something a little daring, a little different.  But that air of fanciful creativity is quickly squelched in favor of formulaic storytelling and cookie cutter characterizations.Interestingly, the filmmakers, for all their championing of the women employed as nannies, seem to have almost as low an opinion of the profession itself as do the elite snobs who appear on screen.All told, Johansson is really the only decent thing about ""The Nanny Diaries"" (well, little Nicholas Art is pretty cool too), but even her staunchest admirers would be well advised to look the other way when it comes to this film.",N/A
1194902,"The problem in reviewing any movie is that in all likelihood one will inadvertently reveal too much and spoil it for others.  And I'm afraid I will as well.  Personally, I think this movie works best if people forgo looking at any of the reviews and see this film fresh and without prejudice (so rent it first).  That being said, here is my review.KNOWING is an eye-popping movie with excellent visuals and special effects ... the airliner disaster had my jaw dropping.  It is also very effective as a countdown thrill ride.  I loved its ambiguities, but because of this, many people have different interpretations and either loved or hated this movie with equal ferocity, depending upon which interpretation they perceived.  Two such movies with similar conflicts are Stanley Kubrick's, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and Steven Spielberg's (in honor of Kubrick who was to direct this movie) AI: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.In 2001, ambiguities run rampant.  What did any of it mean?  What's the monolith all about?  What exactly turned HAL into a killer?  What in the heck happened in the entire last act?  In AI, one will ask many questions as well, especially, who were those creatures at the end?  Aliens (as so many believed) or highly advanced robots who were seeking knowledge of their creator (humans)?  People either hated these movies or loved them depending upon their personal interpretations.  Hint ... they were NOT aliens in AI.In many ways we see the same ambiguities concerning KNOWING; are the creatures aliens or are they angels (or even a combination of both if one thinks our belief system was alien influenced)?  If one really watches and pays the least bit of attention, one ""should"" clearly see the director's intent.  Hint ... they were ... ________ (meaning: find out for yourselves).I thought KNOWING was an entertaining ride that kept me interested throughout, but as we begin to understand that we may be looking at a disaster of mega proportions, other questions of why and for what purpose does this list of numbers serve, begins to settle in.  Is our universe random and chaotic?  Or is there an order and design that is impossible for us to grasp?  In truth, neither interpretation matters much because there is nothing the human race can do about cosmological events.I felt that this movie was quite thought provoking (plenty of discussions around the water cooler).  Personally, I loved the numerology concept of this movie -- a random set of numbers that perhaps aren't as random as we thought on first look, which in itself raises more questions ... as does the Bible Code -- a meaningless set of letters and numbers that form words and meanings that can be found on any written page and book, while people see precisely what they want to see?  Or something else that is far more compelling and meaningful?).  There are many subtleties in this movie, far more than first meets the eye, and several that I didn't pick up on until the second viewing, including the significance of the boy's hearing problem (obviously, I'm not the only one to miss this).I also liked the movie's pace, allowing the tension to escalate as each piece of the puzzle was laid out before us.  All in all, I'm happy to have this film in my fledgling blu-ray library.  To me it is an impressive film that allows the viewer to search his or her own mind on the questions it tries to raise.  I find this a strength, while for others it's a weakness -- there is a wide difference of opinion in the merits of this film, which I think was the director's intent all along.For what it is worth, I viewed this movie on an LN40B630 Samsung HDTV, using an Oppo BDP-83 blu-ray player and a Zvox 2.1 sound system.  So what's my rating?  Times have changed, and I don't think I should just rate the movie, but also the blu-ray qualities as well. That being said, here are my ratings:Video = a solid 9 out of 10 (some absolutely gorgeous and pristine scenes as well as some really stunning ""wow"" moments).Audio = 8 out of 10 (even without a 5.1 or 7.1 system, I was impressed with the audio track -- it enhanced the entire movie experience).Movie = a very solid 8 out of 10 (a very good movie, but a bit problematic in areas because of the purposely conceived ambiguities, which created its own plot hole).  And while the child actors were no Haley Joel Osment  or Dakota Fanning, I felt they did a credible job.  All-in-all, a much maligned movie (as was 2001 and AI) that I felt wasn't given nearly the credit it deserves.  BTW, and just to let people know where I'm coming from, I thought 2001 was a 5-star classic, while AI was a near-classic and a wonderful tribute to Kubrick.",N/A
1289732,"We got in a few of these at the video store, and although they are not suppose to be released until Dec. 22. I took a peak anyways. What a waste of time -- This was a terrible movie!The storyline is almost identical to the 1st ""American Pie"". 3 Guys make a pack to lose their virginity. Although similar, there is one major difference in this film when compared to the original. This time the Sex Bible (originally shown in ""American Pie 1"") is the central part the storyline. Yes the same book that Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) discovers in the Great Falls high school library and uses to sexually please Vicky (Tara Reid) in her bedroom. The book has been partially destroyed in a flood (due to fire sprinklers being set off after a small fire.) Now the 3 main characters (of this film) are on a mission to restore the book and lose their virginity at the same time.There are lots of familiar scenes in this film that are almost identical to the original ""American Pie"" including several references to sex with Food items, animals, and household appliances. Also there are several scenes where the main character's sex life is exposed on the internet (sound familiar?). Furthermore, we have another Stiffler who is oddly similar to the original character created by Seann William Scott but not portrayed as well. And if that is not enough, the film also includes a foreign exchange student (Nadia's cousin) although her part is small and unclear as to what she actually adds to the storyline.Basically if You have seen the original ""American Pie"", and maybe ""Hot Dog... The Movie"" (due to some similar ski lodge scenes) then you have seen this movie. Wish I could give a better review to this one, but it was just not that great of a Pie movie (unlike the last few released.) Maybe they should have stayed within the newer storyline they created with ""American Pie presents The Naked Mile"", and ""American Pie presents Beta House"". At least these two movies were actually worth watching more then once.The only slightly interesting aspect of this movie is the assorted guest appearances by former child stars, rock stars, and Classic Television stars. Some of those include Dustin Diamond (Skreech), C. Thomas Howell, Christopher Knight (Peter Brady), Tim Matheson, Bret Michaels (Poison), Kevin Federline (Britney Spears Ex-husband), Sherman Hemsley (The Jeffersons), Steve Railsback, and a few others. Maybe this just shows how bad this movie is considering they could not even hire a decent cast other than Eugene Levy (in all American Pie Films) and Rosanna Arquette.Overall unless you are just interested in obtaining this dvd to complete your collection, I think I would stay away from this film.",N/A

553857,"The only reason that I continue to wade through the dross that makes up the majority of cinema is in order to stumble across films like 'The Asphyx'. Back when BBC1 and ITV in the UK used to show late night movies, films of it's ilk would regularly turn up and be etched forever into impressionable young minds like mine. I remember first seeing it after my father taped it off of the now defunct 'Thames Television' station back in the early nineteen eighties. Images from it have stayed with me to this day and, reappraising it again, I was impressed by how well it has stood the test of time and how it treats its subject matter in the kind of adult and deftly subtle manner that you very rarely see in horror-film making these days. It's a thoroughly interesting horror film because there is not really an evil character in it - indeed, the character who would generally be tarred with the ""evil"" brush in a less subtle treatment is deeply humanitarian and only really motivated by a profound sense of loss and a fear of being left alone in the world. It's this fear and vulnerability that will eventually set in motion a chain of events that will have devastating consequences for all involved, but, as it is, the rendering of the character by the late, great Robert Stephens engenders only sympathy for his plight as that which he holds most dear is slowly and systematically stripped away. There is virtually no onscreen gore in this film and virtually no violence, but it's denouement is still one of the most haunting that I've ever seen and leads me to wonder whether a young Stephen King didn't borrow elements of it for 'The Green Mile'. In the hands of a director like Christopher Nolan, a remake of this film would be most welcome, if crafted with same care and attention lavished on the original.

Most of all, there's Frank Usher (Richard Boone), older and wiser than the two he runs with, and more ruthless than them both. He's the kind of man who laughs when a woman burns her hands on a hot coffee pot he could have warned her of. Brennan knows Frank Usher will have Chink and Billy Jack gun them down as soon as Usher has the ransom he demands for Mrs. Mims. Brennan and Mrs. Mims must wait and take their chances. In the meantime, we get to see some of what makes Frank Usher tick and of the kind of man Pat Brennan is.Decision at Sundown:This is a drama without, for 50 minutes of the 77-minute running time, any gripping motivation for Bart Allison's (Randolph Scott) hatred. We know something, probably nasty, happened to a woman named Mary and that the slick Tate Kimbrough (John Carroll) had something to do with it. But what? Allison's sick obsession with killing Kimbrough (""For three years I've hunted Kimbrough, but he didn't know it. Before I settle with him I want him to know he's being hunted.""), even on Kimbrough's wedding day when Allison arrives at Sundown, seems more like a plot device than a major justification for violence. The movie's not all that bad, but not very good. I'll say this: The conclusion, bitter and drunken, almost makes up for the rest.Buchanan Rides Alone:Surprising and surprisingly good. Randolph Scott is not the lone man on horseback who rides into town with a righteous grudge. He's just Tom Buchanan (Randolph Scott), riding up from Mexico where he earned a stake big enough to buy the spread in West Texas he's always wanted. When he crosses the border and enters Agry Town, the county seat of Agry County, California, things are going to turn bad fast. Judge Simon Agry runs the town with a soft, greasy hand. He's pudgy, ambitious, hypocritical, cautious and double dealing. Sheriff Lew Agry is a tough man with a beefy face, a solid gut and a rancid disposition. By the end of the movie, the Agry brothers and their town get what they deserve. And Tom Buchanan heads to west Texas, his gold stake back in his gun belt and a nice, satisfied smile on his face.Ride Lonesome:This movie is a fine example of skilled craftsmanship matched with economy of purpose...including the economy of writing, directing, editing and acting. In fact, the only non-economical things about this movie are the over-blown music score and Karen Steele's bosom. It takes only seven minutes to know what we need to know about Ben Brigade (Randolph Scott), the kind of man he is, what he's planning to do with the young murderer he captured, Billy John, and to be impressed as all get out with the hot, dry, boulder-strewn setting. But then the story starts to change. Something else is going on in Ben Brigade's head besides bounty hunting and bringing in Billy John to be hanged in Santa Cruz. And it ain't nice. It's all going to come together at the hangin' tree. Might not be pretty, but it's going to be tense and surprising.Comanche Station:A tall man on a horse. A face as leathery as his saddle. A determination to do what needs doing. And fast with a gun when he needs to be. It must be Randolph Scott. Comanche Station is the last movie Scott made with Boetticher. It has a taut, crisp screenplay by their frequent collaborator, Burt Kennedy. If Comanche Station -- well made, small scale but looking big, with plenty of tension between Scott and the bad guy -- isn't quite in the same league as The Tall T and Ride Lonesome, it'll do.""A lot of money has a way of making a man all greed inside,"" says smiling gunman Ben Lane (Claude Akins).""Such as?"" says Jefferson Cody (Randolph Scott).Lane gives a smile. ""It can get him to thinking of doing things he might not otherwise do,"" he says. ""You know, it's a long way to Lawrenceburg. It wouldn't surprise me if somebody didn't try to take that woman away from you.""""Like you, for instance?""""Like me, in particular,"" says Lane.The woman is Mrs. Nancy Lowe (Nancy Gates), captured by Comanches. Lane is all too happy to tell Mrs. Lowe that her husband, who didn't go out searching for her himself, has posted a $5,000 reward for her. He doesn't mention that includes her alive or just the body. Seems the husband wants closure. As with all the Budd Boetticher/Randolph Scott movies, the bad guys pay a price. But that's not the end of the story. You may be surprised. I didn't see it coming.The DVD transfers are fine.",The Films of Budd Boetticher: (Tall T / Decision at Sundown / Buchanan Rides Alone / Ride Lonesome / Comanche Station)

These two programs are very efficient at burning a lot of calories in a short period of time with intense cardio and toning circuits.

I always feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish the workouts, especially the second one, which is more intense than the first.  The only reason I hesitate to give this five stars is because the three mini toning workouts at the end did not seem very effective to me.

232978,"Poor Harry Mosby, retired Oakland Raider turned detective. His father left him when he was a little kid. All these years later, he finds out his wife is cheating.To get away from family problems, he flies from Los Angeles to Florida to look for the missing teen daughter of a haggard Hollywood starlet. He finds the permiscuous girl, has an affair with the women taking care of her, and meanwhile, uncovers a smuggling ring.All of this is done in Night Moves 70s style. Fimled in 1973, the dialouge in the film has the sharp, hip momentum.  Sex is now out in the open, and  the middle class is absorbing a new cultural attitude. Even the straight charactors do and they say things that they never would have in 1969. Watergate was in full swing. People knew the rules had changed, and were not changing back.If your into period style, yes, everybody is walking around with thick moustaches, sideburns, turtlenecks and blazers. Going one better, the entire score of the film is done on a Fender Rhodes electric panio.But it is Gene Hackman's Mosby who makes Night Moves. He is a gentle giant. He only strikes when attacked, shown by his refusal to hit his wife's lover, or her when she is unrepentant about her daliance. The teenage girl he is looking for, and locates, comes on to him, but he does not accept her advances. He, however, does give her fatherly comfort when she has a nightmare. The hurt kid in Mosby connects with the hurt kid he finds.Mosby is smart, and knows deep down that he is capable of more than the work he does. But he is trapped by a relentless impulse to track people down--people who he displaces for his father.He is always intent on the truth, except when it comes to facing his emotions. When he gets to the bottom of things, he never likes what he discovers.  His behvaior reveals his sweet,wounded character.Hackman is perfect at this and the rest of the cast are also perfect. But the film isn't. The most dynamic drama in Night Moves occurs in LA, particually between Harry and his wife. His sojurn to Florida changes the visual and dramatic texture of the film. The sequence there is long, and the screws of the film loosen just when they should tighten. Keeping the action close to home would have been a plausealbe option--who said the missing girl had to be across the country? It would have been more dramatic to keep all the events of the film in a small space, and keep the tention between the Mosbys cooking.Still, this has some great acting and works as a period piece. Well worth seeing.",N/A

1009867,"Up until the successor, Medieval II Total War, Rome Total War was my favorite video game ever.  Almost totally modifiable, and the most accurate depiction of ancient warfare, along with the capabilities of fielding thousands of individual units on the field at once for top-notch accuracy and combat.And as is done in many ""battle replays"" and historical battles, the best way to put this to use educationally is put to use in this series, ""Decisive Battles"", which uses this video game technology to display what previously could only be done with huge film budgets and thousands of extras.One of the best parts is that every bit of video game footage is actual game footage.  The graphics aren't perfect, and all the troops within a unit look identical, but it's arguably the best portrayal of the sheer size and scope of ancient battles in a documentary, with the game footage churning out TENS of thousands of units on the field, far beyond that which the game could even allow on one side.The documentaries also feature the use of the in-game music, composed by Jeff van Dyck, and the traditional use of historians and the like speaking about the historical subjects, my favorite of which being Steven Pressfield for the episodes on Marathon and Thermopylae.The scope of the battles cover some of the more commonly known, such as the battle of Marathon, Thermopylae, Cannae, Teutoberg Forest, and Gaugamela, but I'm also delighted at the inclusion of such battles as the battle of Cynocephalae (the first decisive battle of the Macedonian Wars between Rome and Macedon), the battle of Kadesh (the oldest known recorded battle in history, between the Egyptians and the Hittites), the battle of Adrianople, the battle of Watling Street, and so on and so on.Perhaps the game content would make it impossible, but if they either hired the modteam for ""Europa Barbarorum II"" or designed units themselves, I could easily see this series becoming far more impressive and astounding if it were re-made (or simply done with the base game's Medieval units) using ""Medieval II Total War"" for a new set of ""Decisive Battles"" documentaries.  It would be phenomenal, with the inclusion of non-cloned armies, grit, and blood.Another set of documentaries were produced by BBC, using Rome Total War, called ""Time Commanders"", which features simultaneously two groups of people re-creating historical battles and fighting them out themselves, alongside and following with descriptions of the actual battles.  I find it even more impressive for including some not very well known battles, such as the battle of Leuctra (in which the Theban Sacred Band destroyed the Spartans using innovative new weapons and tactics).",Decisive Battles of the Ancient World

Now I watched them all in one night which I don't usually do and I'm so disappointed that there's no more episodes.TV Powers that be are just as stupid about DVD releases as they are about creating, marketing, and cancelling great shows.There are more cancelled shows on DVD that have turned out to be excellent TV watching than there are TV shows that air for years and are worth watching.

409685,"Had to see what the hubbub was about with Romero's original ""classics."" So, I got suckered into seeing this steaming pile. I'm giving it two stars pretty much on Romero's name alone, as an innovator in the zombie genre. NOT because it's high cinema, which I really DON'T think it is.To be frank, the movie seems anachronistic and rather tame by today's standards. Sure it was made in the 70's and for the time it was considered to be pushing the envelope. Today, well, it just doesn't hold up against modern zombie movies.I mean, the zombies are just people in blue makeup. Terrifying, I know! (Not so much...) They shamble... Slowly. Like you could get away from them with a brisk walk! (Horrifying!) There was no tension. There was no foreboding terror. Not even a little good-natured shiver going down my spine. Really it was a few hours of boredom. I think at one point I even checked how much longer the movie had left to run (about 1/2 an hour), that how bored I was. I was waiting all movie for some serious zombie munching and was disappointed at its overall absence outside of the last 1/2 hour (and even that was fairly tame and movie-esque, in my opinion; though perhaps forgivable given the era of cinema it was released in).I kept wanting the people to stop being dumb arses and go on a zombie killing spree. I mean, the zombies are slow. They have NO evasion skills. They have no ""strategery"" skills (yes, I know, I mean strategy, geez!). The humans have access to a gun store and about all the ammo they can possibly use. The reason they couldn't simply walk around methodically (and briskly!) decapitating zombies or blasting them in the skull with shot guns was WHAT now? I mean, if your first thought is survival isn't the object to eliminate the walking dead so they don't sneak up on you while you're using the can? But no, they just let the zombies go about their business for the first third of the movie.This movie didn't frighten me. It didn't disturb me (unlike 28 Days Later, which was rather disturbing insofar as the ""infected"" kept vomiting blood and stuff all over the place). There was maybe one scene of a guy getting ripped apart for being a dumb arse and sticking his arm into a blood pressure monitoring machine's arm strap in the middle of an ongoing zombie invasion. Frankly he deserved what he got and I had zero sympathy for him. That and he was part of a roving band of marauders, so I had double the zero sympathy for him (what's two times zero?)...Yeah, it may have been considered pioneering at the time, but today it's just a piece of tame, anachronistic tripe. If you want something a considerably less tame try theRemakeor theResident Evil TrilogyorSlitherorPlanet Terror.Sure, the classics are ""classic."" They're the genre's ""origins."" They're good for film school classes and for seeing ""how far we've come."" But do the stand the test of time? Honestly, I've seen better and scarier and less overtly boring.",Dawn of the Dead VHS
699045,"I liked it and found it to be well-paced compared to some of its contemporaries (although it is still a bit slow compared to many modern movies). The big surprise though was how much my six year old daughter enjoyed it, laughing out loud like a banshee several times.  I think that's the first time she's done that when we've watched a film together, and believe me we've been through a whole library. Perhaps it was because of the somewhat sinister opening, which may have frightened her a bit and built up the expectation of some nasties to follow, when in fact the comedy comes on stream instead. So perhaps she was laughing out of relief.  Or perhaps it was just the excellent performance of Mr. Ustinov, a fine comic actor with wonderful delivery and timing.  I wouldn't personally describe it as a hilarious film, but it does have some great set pieces such as the field sports scenes where the ghost helps hopeless Godolphin on to victory.  Moreover, it is one of those films that leaves a pleasant aftertaste, and a slightly nostalgic wistfulness for a simpler time with simpler movies",Blackbeard's Ghost VHS
1997,"The Zen of Screaming is, as other reviewers indicated, largely Cross promoting herself.  She uses her own, local students in the DVD, and they continually give testimonials about how wonderful Cross is.  But if you can get beyond Cross' annoying self-promotion and talent-free clients, you'll find she really does have something to teach.The DVD is worth watching once, just for drill.  The CD of vocal exercises really is valuable and could have easily stood on its own.  The techniques aren't new, but do remind singers how to access more power without damaging their vocal chords or fighting chronic laryngitis (my personal problem).I taught drama for decades and recommended Born To Sing by Howard Austin and Elizabeth Howard to my students.  In those days it was simply an audio cassette of vocal exercises, but is now a complete and extremely comprehensive package.  If you're beginning or have never studied voice, try Born To Sing first!The whole Zen Of Screaming package really is overpriced, so if you can get it used, all the better.

1078377,"Once again, this season expands into new territory.  It already covers city politics, the so-called drug war, and cops v. gangsters.  This time around, a whole new roster of characters - the children who will staff the street and those who will be preyed upon - is introduced.  The child actors are absolutely perfect, indeed there is not a single note from them that does not ring true.  You empathize with them, even though their experience is beyond anything us suburban types could truly imagine.  You hope for these kids, despise some of them, and weep for their lack of options.Meanwhile, the lives of the cops move on.  Having taken a beat cop position far beneath his talents, McNulty seems to have turned his life around with a new relationship, moderate drinking, and some satisfaction at his accomplishments however ambivalent he feels about ending the game with Barksdale.  You really hope for him as the other cops take center stage.  But the real action is in the schools, where the ex-cops (Prez and the disillusioned and controversial captain who quasi-legalized drugs) are attempting to reach the kids.  And of course, there is the rise of Marlo, the shrewd sociopath who is taking the crown of Baltimore drug king.What is so amazing about this series is that it never falls into formula or stereotype.  In addition to surprise plot twists, the characters are so realistic that the viewer believes them implicitly.  Even the ironies are believable.  In terms of resolutions, things are never cleanly tied off, but end in compromise or failure, often tragically.Warmly recommended.  This is the best.",The Wire: Season 4

1232411,"Of all the Key anime series that have been localized for the American audience, Key is the weakest of the lot. It contains all the usual Key elements - gorgeous back grounds, a tragic story line, a mystical or magical element to the backstory, and lots and lots of cute anime girls. However, for some reason, the elements that made Kanon and Clannad so good don't fit together so well in this story. It's almost as if they put all the various Key elements into a box, shook it up, and poured them out on a table and called the result a new series. I can almost see the lab geek with a clipboard checking things off. ""Pretty Girl cast, check. Mysterious magical powers or tragic backstory for each girl, check. Forgotten past life connection between the hero and the obvious heroine, check. Ambiguous pretty boy hero, check. Single mom/aunt/caretaker for hero/heroine, check. Pretty art, check. Nice music, check. Okay, call it a wrap. Put it in a box and ship it!""Oops, forgot to write a story that makes sense.There are two things that should serve as a warning: right on the back of the box, it reads ""The questions are rampant, but the answers float aimlessly in the air."" Which, in plainspeak, means even the people who made the thing can't figure out what is going on. Then, if you read the box for ""Air, The Motion Picture"" (which, admittedly, I have not yet watched) it describes itself as ""a cinematic reinvention of the acclaimed television series"". A good story would not have needed ""reinvention"".Before you read any further, I will warn you that I do include spoilers in this next bit. The story, such as it is, is this: Yukito is a traveling performer who can make dolls move with his magical powers. He also is looking for a mysterious ""girl in the sky"" that his mother had been looking for her entire life and never found. As the story goes on, we learn that the girl in the sky suffers from sad dreams, but if she should ever stop dreaming, she will die. Then we meet Misuzo, a clumsy ditz who befriends Yukito. She has an odd phobia in that she gets hysterical if she makes a friend because she's lost everybody in her life she cared about up to that point. She is an orphan, being cared for by her aunt who doesn't seem to give a hang about the girl and isn't at all disturbed when she brings home Yukito. Yukito then encounters a wide assortment of other schoolgirl/love interests, any one of whom may or may not be the girl in the sky because most have magical powers of some kind or other. As Yukito and Misuzo get closer to each other, Misuzo reveals that she has dreams about flying, which are very sad dreams, and Yukito begins to wonder if she is the girl he has been looking for.At this point the story begins to lose its way. We discover that Yukito's mom actually knew the girl in the sky, and promised to take her to the beach, thinking this might make her happy and stop the sad dreams, but the girl in the sky dies before she can fulfill her promise. So the duty passes on to Yukito to find the girl and fulfill her last wish, which is kind of hard to do since she supposedly died. Then, suddenly, we find ourselves in fuedal Japan, where the whole story line of the magical winged girls is explored. Then Yukito, evidently remembering that he was a samarai who protected the winged girl in fuedal Japan, vows to use all his powers to make Misuzo happy before she has the final dream and dies. And things go totally whack-a-ding-hoy. He turns into the idiot bird who has been hopping around in and out of all the episodes. We then see a retelling of Misuzo's life, with minor changes so that things will have a happier ending. So far so good. Then Misuzo's aunt, who now suddenly has really loved her all along, vows to take Misuzo to the beach. This fulfills Misuzo's final wish, so she up and dies, making Yukito's unexplained transformation and sacrifice meaningless. And here the TV series ended. The story left me thinking that the writers had all the elements of a good story but did not know how to put the pieces together. All the side stories, centering around the other girls, seem unrelated and tacked on, the girls seeming to be there only to provide Yukito other love interests.We then get the ""Air in Summer"" specials, which takes the feudal Japan back story and expands upon it. The only thing the specials explains is that Yukito is the descendant of the two bodyguards for the Girl in the Sky, a samarai and a lady magician, who after the death of the Girl in the Sky, decided that she will probably be reincarnated somewhere down the road so they should start having babies with each other so that their descendants can watch out after the next incarnation of the Girl in the Sky. One again, the whole Yukito=bird and Why the heck did Misuzo Have To Die questions are unresolved.All these complaints aside, if you like Key series, you will probably like Air. But it is the poorest, so far, of the Key offerings. It seems almost like they were writing this anime following a formula, without any inspiration to guide them. The music is nice, the art is pretty, (though the backgrounds are gorgeous, the characters themselves look like they were lifted out of a video game and don't have the same level of finish as the backgrounds). If you can make sense of the story, you are a smarter person than I am. But even at it's worst, Air is a much better watch than, say, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z or (shudder) Naruto.",Air: The Complete Series
698147,"Lest you hold that old-fashioned romance is dead and gone, here comes a quality movie to flick your earlobe reprovingly and to gainsay that belief. 2001's KATE & LEOPOLD stars Hugh Jackman at his elegant, charming best and Meg Ryan, appealing as ever and very much in her wheelhouse. And while not quite as classic as Meg's SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE or WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... this torn-out-of-time, fish-out-of-water romantic comedy sparkles with humor, appealing characters, and, yup, romance.Hugh Jackman plays the robust fictional Leopold, third duke of Albany (as opposed to the sickly real-life Leopold, duke of Albany). In Jackman's hands Leopold isn't some fancy pants twit but rather a suave, well-mannered and stand-up guy. It's April 28, 1876 and Leopold has brought his destitute but noble pedigree to New York, his uncle insisting that he find some rich American heiress to marry. We learn early on that Leo is not only an engineering inventor of sorts but that he's also discontented with his royal lot in life.Meanwhile, in modern-day New York, Kate (Meg Ryan) on the surface is a successful career woman, doing big things in market research. But her personal life is a mess, Kate having just a month ago broken up with her longtime boyfriend Stuart (Liev Schreiber), a scientific louse obsessed solely with time portals. And who happens to be the great-great grandson of Leopold the third duke of Albany. Past and present get Kevin Baconed when Stuart discovers and uses a time portal to the past, just off the Brooklyn Bridge, and returns with an ancestral passenger accidentally in tow.Kate and Leopold meet, and it's not pretty, what with the jaded, heartbroken Kate finding Leo in her ex-boyfriend's crib. Then there's how Leo is dressed like Sergeant Pepper. But this is Meg Ryan, whose mutant power is to embody the wistful, starry-eyed heroine in these things, so slowly Leo begins to have an effect. To ratchet the suspense, elevators all over the city begin to malfunction, this being a side effect of Leopold not being in his own time. It makes sense once you realize that in his rightful era, Leopold - who, remember, is an engineer - would go on to invent the lift. And if Leo were not to return to his rightful era, well, cue in the scary repercussions...Hugh Jackman owns this movie even more so than Meg Ryan. Those who've seen him take on the grim superhero part (snikt!) in the X-Men films may be surprised that Hugh can also play a convincing cultured Englishman. He demonstrates this saving grace, a self-deprecating quality, which keeps him from venturing into snobbyland. So you end up liking him even as he imparts lessons in gentlemanly refinement and etiquette to various contemporary New Yorkers. Hugh's romancing of Meg is fun to watch and the most key element in the film, but, let's face it, the love story is a foregone conclusion. So, really, it's Hugh's reactions to his shocking new environs which particularly caught my interest. Would that we all were as graceful under similarly unfamiliar straits (although, yeah, his royal dudeness does lose it a bit when confounded by the enigmatic toaster).It's fun watching Leopold interacting with New York's fast-lane living denizens. It's a given that the ladies would be bowled over by his charm and couth and accent. But I was surprised at how well Jackman works with Breckin Meyer, who plays Kate's aimless younger brother. It isn't too long before Breckin's character is looking up to Leo and taking his advice in behavior and in how to woo a chick. Breckin also just gave me a mantra for dealing with stubborn bottles of certain condiments: ""You shake and shake the ketchup bottle; none will come, and then a lot'll.""Casting aside the trappings of time travel, KATE & LEOPOLD is a throwback, wafting in that whiff of old-fashioned romance. It's just as well that the time portal angle isn't dwelled on for much of the movie (other than in the running Stuart sub-plot), as it probably would've just muddied up the waters. As it is, we get to take in wonderful performances by Meg Ryan, being her sweet self, and Hugh Jackman, terrific as a nobleman out of his time but not out of his element. Hugh's Leopold reminds us that, even in the face of swines and cynicism, there's yet a place for good manners. And that also, back in the day, operas weren't just for sissies.",Kate & Leopold
1195043,"Knowing starts out strong, with a '50s era flashback to a creepy kid obsessed with numbers, that also serves to remind us that this film is aiming for something of a '50s science fiction vibe.  As part of the opening ceremony for a new elementary school, kids put pictures of the future into a time capsule, with plans to open it up 50 years later.  The creepy dark-haired girl puts her list of seemingly random numbers into the mix, along with the crayon drawings produced by the rest of the kids.Fifty years later, of course, Nick Cage plays a single father and MIT astrophysicist whose belief in providence was shaken by the death of his wife.  When the time capsule is opened, and his son gets the numbers, and as he comes to see what the numbers mean, it becomes apparent that even senseless tragedy may not be simply random.  Alex Proyas channelsClose Encounters of the Third Kindfor a number of plot elements and for a religious sense of mystery that drives the film, but aims less for a sense of wonder as dread, until things start to get silly.  Still, it's a fun ride and well worth watching, and comes to a satisfying finish.In what follows I won't give away the end, but may say too much for some, so if you don't want spoilers, stop reading .... The creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and dread that director Alex Proyas sets up to begin with gradually gives way to hokey and predictable developments as, in classic Hollywood style, Cage's scientist and his personal and family dramas become perfect microcosms of events of cosmic significance.  Where saving the world and falling in love and reconciling with family and healing old wounds all come to amount to the same thing.  My wife and I could not help but laugh out loud as Nick Cage promised his son with utter sincerity that he wouldn't let anything happen to him - even as it had just been proven to him beyond reasonable doubt that he had no power to prevent the calamities the mysterious numbers were predicting.  Or when Rose Byrne's character, faced with the destruction of the world (including herself and her daughter) explains how devastated she would be without her daughter if the upcoming disaster causes them to be separated, and Nick's character nods, knowing exactly how she feels.  Of course, and the thing that would really get me most about my entire city (including myself and my entire family and everyone around me) being destroyed in a nuclear explosion is that I'd miss my dog and be sad about being separated from my wife and kids.And what about the numbers?  Apparently supernatural beings wanted to warn us about impending disasters by revealing the numbers to a young girl.  Of course, that didn't help much when the numbers ended up in a time capsule for the duration of most of the disasters.  I guess the girl who knew them lived long enough to let others know about them, but they thought she was crazy.  Still, even those who knew about  and wanted to avert the predicted disasters were unable to change their fate - so what was the point of a bunch of pale supernatural beings sitting around watching to be sure the kids made the right predictions if they couldn't do anything about it?  Perhaps, I guess, to convince them that the final prophecy was real and so they should go along?  Why not just explain things to the kids, since clearly they were able to?  It might make sense if somehow the plot established that their only means of communication was through numbers, but that's not the case, as revealed in the course of things.  There's a lot here that doesn't make a lot of sense, except as a way of tying some kind of voodoo fascination with numerology to an apocalyptic scenario.Still, I have to say, in spite of the eventual goofiness as the film became overly melodramatic, it was a lot of fun to watch, and had a satisfying end.  In some ways the hokey elements add to the appeal - it's like watching '50s science fiction, where the wild implausibility combined with the seriousness of the characters gives just the right balance of melodrama and intensity to keep you on the edge of your seats and smiling.  Proyas manages to keep the characters interesting, and has a strong visual sense both for creating a vivid atmosphere in the ""ordinary"" moments and for creating extraordinarily convincing scenes of destruction.  I'm not sure what is his fascination with pale ""watcher"" type villians - since if you look at all his films that's what they are, fromDark CitytoI, Robot(note the similarity of the robots to the scary types in this film) - I can't rememberThe Crowwell enough to say if it fits there as well (I saw it in theaters when it first came out, and that was a long time ago).  But they do work, and create a palpable sense of cinematic dread (until you see them up close and they start to look a bit silly).",N/A
1251423,"To most, a Yash Chopra production is synonymous with big doings - of storytelling done on a lavish scale, of an extravagant love story, and the brightest talents in Bollywood. RAB NE BANA DI JODI happens to falter on several of these elements. But while it may not be on the same tier as past Yash Chopra classics (Dilwale dulhania le jayenge,Veer-Zaara,Fanaa, etc.), it's still very much worth watching. Bollywood megastar Shahrukh Khan, as expected, carries this romantic comedy.On her wedding day Taani (Anushka Sharma), young and vivacious, receives the shocking news that the bus carrying her fiance enroute to the wedding had crashed, with her fiance numbered amongst the casualties. Taani's professor father, upon learning the news, suffers a massive and eventually fatal heart attack. On his death bed, her father, not wanting Taani to be alone, talks her into entering a marriage with his favorite student Surinder Sahni (Shahrukh Khan).Surinder is a nondescript-looking guy, one of those unnoticed types who toil in his cubicle, working as he does for the Punjab Power company, responding to all phone calls with what I think is a pretty neat company motto, ""Punjab Power, lighting up your life."" Surinder (or Suri)  is bespectacled and quiet and kind, and becomes instantly smitten with Taani. But he understands that his marriage to her is only one of conveniece, Taani frankly declaring that she could never fall in love with him, even though she vows to fulfill her wifely obligations. Suri, never expecting someone like Taani to enter his life, professes himself content.Things go on like this for a time, with Taani continuing to mope and with her and Suri sleeping in separate bedrooms. One day Taani sees a flyer for Dancing Jodi, a dance school competition, and she decides to participate. Suri, longing to see her happy and dancing again, pays for the dance classes and then dons a disguise so that he could be near her, not in a pervo way but so that he could enjoy the sight of her having fun. For the introverted Suri, things are about to get ridiculously out of hand.It doesn't really make sense, but somehow Suri's best friend is this outgoing, macho salon owner (yes, I said ""macho salon owner!"") named Bobby Khosla. Bobby does a makeover on Suri and transforms him into this hip, happening cat named Raj Kapoor. Raj wears tight clothes, has poofy hair, and tends to be loud and obnoxious. Thru the luck of the draw, he ends up being Taani's dance partner. Taani dislikes him within moments, but, then again, you know how these movies go. Soon enough, thanks to Raj's antics, Taani is laughing and feeling alive again. And Suri, trapped in a web of his own making, soon finds himself in a fight for his marriage, with his alter ego as his rival. It's all very twisted, but fun.Fun, because the tone doesn't ever get to that dark place. Shahrukh Khan plays the strutting Raj Kapoor as a caricature, exagerrated and over-the-top. Raj isn't very likeable, but then I don't ever think he was meant to be. It's weird, even keeping in mind that Raj and Suri were the same person, I still could not warm up to Raj. As Shahrukh says in an interview: ""The essence of the whole thing is, that you're going to love only one guy - and that is Suri."" That's one dichotomy in Shahrukh's dual roles. I don't think much of his portrayal of Raj, even if Raj's resulting traits were deliberate on Shahrukh's part (I'm guessing he intended him to be this aggravating). Obversely, Shahrukh's self-sacrificial Suri is sweet and heart-breaking and thoroughly endearing. As Shahrukh also says, ""Ninety-nine percent of the people are Suris,"" and so many of us Average Joes see ourselves in Suri. With due respect to the showstopper number ""Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte"" - in which Shahrukh gets to dance with some of the most famous actresses with whom he's co-starred in the past - it's the terrific ""Haule Haule"" which really captures my attention. ""Haule Haule"" embodies Suri's gentle spirit and the depth of his feelings for Taani. In the song, when he beams with happiness and does that little dance, one simply cannot help but be won over.The subplot to all this, of course, is the Dancing Jodi competition. You can probably guess how it ends. RAB NE BANA DI JODI (which I think means ""A Couple Made By God"") has its flaws but the effervescent tone, the romance, the nifty songs, and the touches of humor should have you overlooking those failings. It certainly made a killing at the Indian box office. This is Anushka Sharma's cinematic debut, but you wouldn't know it by her self-assured performance and her chemistry with Shahrukh, especially when Shahrukh is playing Suri; it's these two characters whose moments together construct the crux and the romance of the story. And Shahrukh Khan is Shahrukh Khan, in Bollywood the star of stars and his Suri having become one of my all-time favorite roles which this actor has ever brought to life.What I didn't like? Okay, I initially had some trouble buying into Taani's Lois Lane complex, with her just being unable to pierce thru Suri's fairly simple disguise, but I eventually shrugged it off. Because, I guess, since she doesn't spend a lot of time with her husband (only at breakfast and dinner and the occasional movie date) and since the man is habitually so reserved, I can see where it may be difficult for her to put two and two together. In her place, would it occur to you that someone so internal could put on such an audacious act? Another nitpick is that I just found ""Raj Kapoor"" to be so annoying and not once did I feel that he was a character in his own right. And then there's Taani's late epiphany which, to me, simply smacks of the quick fix resolution.What I have is the nice two-disc set with the glossy 3D hologram cover, although it's not cool that Disc 1 sits right on top of Disc 2. Disc 1 offers the feature film (which is 2 hours 44 minutes long) with English sub-titles and the typical song selection option. Disc 2, with the sizable special features: the Making Of RAB NE BANA DI JODI featurette (45 minutes long); the Making Of the musical number ""Haule Haule""; the Making Of the musical number ""Dance Pe Chance""; the Making Of the musical number ""Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte,"" which in addition to featuring five of Shahrukh's past female co-stars is also an homage to different eras of Bollywood (although I think the musical number """"Woh Ladki Hai Kahan"" fromDil Chahta Haidid this better); 6 minutes of deleted scenes (no sub-titles); Shahrukh Khan Unplugged - 62 minutes of SRK - and his ego but with that wit and that twinkle in his eye as a saving grace - as he reflects (mostly in English) on sundry topics like this film's director Aditya Chopra, SRK's film preparation, his dual parts Suri and Raj, the importance of getting newcomer Anushka Sharma as his romantic leading lady, his tight relationship with the Chopra family, etc.; Shahrukh and Anushka In Conversation (43 minutes, chunks of it in Hindi), but definitely get around to just before the 32 minute mark to hear an utterly fascinating bit as Shahrukh answers Anushka's question: ""Who is Shahrukh?""; and the theatrical trailer and promos.Despite Raj Kapoor, I ended up really liking RAB NE BANA DI JODI. The ending is very good, even though you do see it coming. The movie has its good share of funny moments, although, as usual with Bollywood, sometimes the humor is forced. But do keep an eye out for the hilarious Dhoom sequence, in which Taani finds umbrage with two fellow dancers on a motorbike and goes tearing off in pursuit thru the tiny streets on Raj's own motorcycle (with Raj on the back). Then there's the funny epilogue to that scene, as Raj fills in his disbelieving but still macho best friend Bobby on that story (and remember that Bobby knows that Suri is Raj):- Bobby: ""So your wife was riding the bike?""- Suri: ""Yes.""- Bobby: ""At the speed of 120?""- Suri: ""Yes.""- Bobby: ""And what were you doing?""- Suri: ""I was sitting behind.""- Bobby: ""What were you doing at the back?""- Suri: ""I had to hold the handbag, right?""It's funnier in the movie.",Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi
794555,"Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story (Jamie Meltzer, 2003)It's a half-decent bet, especially if you grew up in the eighties, that if you're aware of the song-poem phenomenon, you came to it through a John Trubee song whose name I cannot reproduce on Amazon. But there is more to the song-poem story. Oh, there is a great deal more. And you can learn more about it than you ever wanted to in the essential documentary Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story.The documentary alternately traces the history of song-poems (you know those ads in the backs of magazines telling you to send in your poem/lyrics and $250, and you'll get a professionally recorded song in return? Yeah, those), contains interviews with some of the genre's movers and shakers, both on the lyrical side and in the song mills that crank out song-poems, and show in-the-studio footage that is alternately hysterical and pathetic. Director Meltzer (Welcome to Nollywood) makes no pretensions towards objectivity here; he sees the basic absurdity of the whole industry, and his objective seems to be to show it, from the scary, dysfunctional people who send these poems to be recorded to the recording artists who see themselves as superior to the lyricists (but are just as nuts).I call this ""essential"" because I think it will appeal not only to those who enjoy outsider music, but to just about anyone. People who enjoy the dysfunctional idiots who people reality TV will find a great deal to enjoy here. Those who enjoy the countrywide mediocrity of American Idol will love it. Those who just like a well-turned documentary will get a kick out of it. John Trubee fans will love his jaded take on things. Those who always root for the underdog will find new artists to champion. Really, there's something for everyone here. Find a copy of this and watch it; there's so much to be enjoyed here that it will be well worth your time and effort.

1249783,"Will someone please tell the Emperor that he has no clothes?  Vincent D'Onofrio probably got this role for his extraordinary performance in an episode of the late-lamented ""Homicide:  Life on the Streets"", the one in which the entire hour is devoted to an attempt to extricate him from between a subway car and the platform.  But D'Onofrio's portrayal of Goran in this series is so far over the top as to be almost laughable.  For me, as for any lawyer who watches his performances, his blatant disregard of the rights of the accused under the U.S. Constitution is just too, too ludicrous.  Even the most novice of rookie detectives knows that you can not, without a warrant, go into someone's house or apartment and pick up objects and photographs at will.  And it is not as if the people being investigated by D'Onofrio and Erbe (whose disregard of proper procedure is just a bit less outrageous than that of her partner) are from Papua New Guinea;  they are often doctors, educators, and others who presumably would throw the pair out of the place unless they had a warrant.

Bonus yoga stretch & Spanish option.The lovely landscape background is inspiring, the different songs in each workout (in 5.1 surround sound which sounds awesome) that are different mostly Engima style music is wonderful. Enigma to me is sparse vocals that hold notes, a strong beat/percussion (grounding) & relaxing harmony/melody w/different instruments that is also interesting to keep you awake, a new age style Jazz w/almost a rock & roll emphasis on drums. I find Enya style lovely, but w/o a strong beat, it can bore me or be too sweet w/o the earthy strong beat. Having real songs & such great ones is a great improvement over most workouts.The style of this workout is that it has a dance workout routine.

This then goes to standing & then step back leg down to low twisted lunge w/resting on back knee, repeat. Then add full seated spinal twist (she also twists for a second to the other side without changing leg position which feels good) & then seated wide angle stretch over one leg, then repeat all the previous moves to so the other side seated spinal twist & seated wide angle stretch over the other leg. I did not feel any workout nor enough stretch w/all the repetition.Pros* Patricia's earthy personality* She cues so well, you almost never have to look up* Her very detailed instruction on how to do the pose well, more then most instructors* She even gives helpful hints to even rotate the arms to open the chest which many yoga instructors don't* Where you should be feeling the stretch, where you're strengthening & where on your body to focus your attention* She does all poses slowly & even builds some up for that might be hard for some to think they can do or too stiff at first (those who can can always do the pose while she builds)* She does transitions slowly between poses, feeling as graceful & aware of your body more (also more difficult to hold & move slowly for those who want harder workout or also gives a better stretch)* She reminds you to smile (""Next, lift the corners of your lips..."") & encourages you to do your best & not concern that you can't do as well as you wish* Diff lengths of workouts depending on how much time you have & bonus easy stretch* The choice of real music & to break up the workout to go with the music.Cons:* She does say gratitude too many times, other inspiring words would be better if she is going for that, though how the pose/transition helps certain organs, body parts or emotional/mood is also inspiring.* The repeating was a bit much. I'd rather she introduce 1 pose (in/out which whatever other pose stretches best only a couple times) then the next & next, THEN links them all together at the end a few times at most.",Yoga Dance Fusion

1226267,"I enjoyed this film but I did not feel it was as great as all the hype it has received.  The director uses flashbacks in a confusing manner starting with an adult Jamal being tortured in a Mumbai police station.  We are then treated to all kinds of flashbacks with an adult Jamal playing the India version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire and a very poor kid Jamal being abused by his bully brother Salim.  Salim locks Jamal in an outhouse when the local celebrity comes to visit their villiage.  The only way Jamal can get out is to fall in the cesspool beneath the outhouse.  A Jamal covered with feces is able to get an autograph from the star.Jamal's misery is intensified as his brother sells his Jamal's autographed photo and then a bunch of rioters kill the boys' mother.  The two boys escape the rioters to be taken in by some criminals that are trafficing and exploiting young children.  The boys eventually escape but Salim twarts the escape of Jamal's female friend Latika.The movie follows them as they grow up and Jamal is constantly searching for his friend Latika.  The movie shifts constantly between the present day torture in the police station, Jamal answering questions on the TV game show and the boys story growing up.All through their life Salim is bad to Jamal and Jamal can never seem to find happiness without Latika.  I really liked most of the film but I found the constant flashbacks and time shifts to be annoying.  Also, the subtitles when needed were virtually impossible to read.  Jamal's game show experience did not seem believable except if the movie were to be labelled a fantasy.I did like the Bollywood number that the director threw in to the end.

399530,"With ""Nixon"" director Oliver Stone aims for the next ""Citizen Kane,"" and he proves he's no Orson Welles.It seems odd that a movie sequel can be more melodramatic than its antecedent of fifty years ago but that's exactly the case here, a case made definite by Stone's silly juvenile plagiarism of Kane's beginning. In ""Citizen Kane"" there's the ominous dark cavernous mansion that bespeaks of a life so grand yet ultimately so empty, followed by the rush of reporters in a newsroom determined to discover the secret of ""Rosewood."" ""Nixon"" begins with the Watergate burglars meeting and planning, and then transitions to the White House on a dark night overlaid with ominous music, and then finally to a defeated and alone Richard M. Nixon (Anthony Hopkins).If Oliver Stone were to simply maintain this blatant plagiarism he would at worst be called a plagiarist, which is not really an offense in Hollywood or in life. Yet he trusts his intelligence and his taste and his instincts to create a powerful drama, and he shows that he lacks in all three.Consider Richard Nixon's historic meeting with Chairman Mao, who looks and speaks like the devil. ""You are as evil as I am,"" Mao tells Nixon. The melodrama and implausibility of the scene aren't enough for Stone: he has to overlay the scene with Chinese calligraphy and screamingly annoying music.In the beginning of the movie Mr. Stone has the courtesy to tell us that some scenes are redacted, shortened, or just dramatized from real life -- which is his most comic conceit because it's clear that MOST of the scenes have been imagined. Clearly Oliver Stone believes he is re-making ""Citizen Kane,"" and it is his duty to history to set the record straight once and for all about Nixon.Thus, we should know that Richard Nixon was fundamentally an amoral man whose conscience was his saintly mother (Mary Steenburgen), and then his mother's surrogate and wife Pat (Joan Allen). Indeed Pat Nixon is the film's moral center of gravity, and it is when she finally in 1968 relents to Nixon's relentless political ambition that she loses her moral authority and Nixon fall aparts.We should also know that Nixon's presidency was borne of the death of four people, and it was this that haunted Nixon and permitted him as president to sacrifice without remorse Cambodians, student demonstrators, and finally his own loyal White House staff. Tuberculosis killed Nixon's two brothers and permitted Nixon to attend law school, and Nixon's two deadliest political adversaries -- John and Robert Kennedy -- were conveniently assassinated.In fact Nixon, as the film claims, may have been indirectly responsible for JFK's death by being as Eisenhower's vice-president chair of a secret committee that sanctioned the killing of world leaders sympathetic to communism. As the CIA's Jesse Helms (Sam Waterson) explains to Nixon in one of the film's most outrageously implausible and embarassing scenes, what they created was ""organic"" and ""had a life of its own"": no one could have predicted these same individuals they had unleashed to kill Castro would have come back to kill Kennedy -- but then again no one made Nixon attach his name to documents linking him to these murderers.Stone tries to display different facets of Nixon's personality -- his outrageous paranoia, his self-hatred, his sexual insecurity and jealousy -- but what he best shows is Nixon's pettiness and shallowness and arrogance. And it may be because, despite Stone's professed high-brow cultural impact with his films ""Platoon,"" ""Wall Street,"" and ""Natural Born Killers,"" he is ultimately a petty and shallow and arrogant director. The film in its bloated morality and heavy-handedness treats movie-goers as children to be taught and admonished, as Nixon's mother once taught and admonished him and as Nixon taught and admonished the American people.""Nixon"" is a very flawed film of a very flawed man, and shows a director who we once respected to be very flawed as well.",Nixon VHS
913730,"I would give it 2.5, but I rounded down to two because of all the fives on Amazon.  I read the reviews and was excited after seeing some parts on youtube, but I was left disappointed.  I normally watch films like these with subtitles, but my wife doesn't like that so I used the English dubbing, but I doubt that had anything to do with the atrocious music.I am a big martial arts fan.  I must have watched ""Enter the Dragon"" 100 times as a kid and loved Bruce Lee's other movies.  Later ""Rumble in the Bronx"" renewed my zeal and I eagerly watched Chan's other films, the old and new ""Iron Monkey"" movies, ""Wing Chun"", ""Tai Chi Master"", the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series and many more.  I saw this film and was excited by all the rave reviews.  This movie doesn't use wire work like many of Jet Li's films and I was expecting something akin to the excellent ""Chocolate"", but this movie has several flaws.Before going through the flaws, I would like to say that the fight scenes are pretty exciting.  It was nice to see the Muai Thai fighting style which I was unfamiliar with.First, the plot is poor.  The ""quest"" is for a poor country martial artist to travel to the big city and recover the head of a statue that the village worships.  Apparently they need it back to end the drought that is plaguing their village, but the drought must have started while the statue was whole because he seems to leave almost immediately after the head is stolen.Second, the music is poor.  It is bad enough that I wish I could have turned on subtitles and turned the volume on my TV off.  I've never heard a score this bad in a movie before.Third, the movie frequently stops for two replays whenever Jaa does some interesting move (such as jump over some spikes or do the splits sliding under a truck).  Seeing the same move (which frankly didn't seem that impressive) three times took me out of the movie and ruined the flow of the action.  Switching to slow motion from a different angle would have been much better. Jaa performs several acrobatic feats in one chase scene through alleys and streets, but his pursuers keep up with him, I wonder if that is because he was doing those things three times :).Fourth, several things are just weird.  [some minor spoilers] One instance is that Jaa is basically forced to fight when he steps out in the open towards the clerk that takes bets while the announcer is asking for challengers, yet he is surprised.  Then he gets the clerk to give back the villager's money that his cousin had stolen and bet, but refuses the prize money for winning the fight.  What clerk would just give the money to someone that hadn't bet it when it had been lost?  Another thing is the part that guns play in the movie.  There's one scene near the end when a few people have guns and it is fairly realistic when they avoid being shot.  But later a big fight plays out and the big bad guy only pulls out a gun at the end to shoot him, why didn't the others in there have guns and why did nobody use them earlier?  Another time the bad guy goes through a lengthy speech and tells them that he is now their god and they should obey him.  Then he leaves with instructions to ""kill them quietly"".  It just seemed like he was going to keep them around and use them somehow, but I guess not.  This one might be due to dubbing.  I still don't get why he didn't go to the address he had for the guy that took the head, either immediately when he got to the city or when he was separated from his cousin a few times.  I wonder what he was doing then...Lastly, except for Jaa, the acting is pretty bad.How anyone can give this movie five stars is beyond me.  It has severe deficiencies in directing, acting, plot, score and editing.  Don't take my word for it, buy it yourself and then post an honest review.

1191126,"""What Just Happened"" is an interesting and occasionally funny satire of Hollywood, but that's pretty much it.  The two main conflicts involve a dog killing and Bruce Willis's beard.  Most of the film is just Robert De Niro driving around town trying to resolve these two issues.  There is some meaningful drama between De Niro and his ex-wife, but it's underdeveloped.  I can't imagine *hating* this movie like others have, because there isn't much there to hate, and what's there is enjoyable, if not memorable.Bottom line: Despite the cast, this is a very low-key film that succeeds in what little it's trying to do.

1246615,"Bart Got a Room is one of those could have been great films, drawing from the John Hughes school of teen angst comedy.  It starts out with a bang...jazz music.  I find most teen comedies have a lot of really bad rock in them, like Blink 182 or similar band.  So, from the beginning, it seemed like a movie for teens, but something where the writing was better than average.  And indeed this is a mix of both teen and dysfunctional family comedy.Both the title of the DVD and design of the cover is misleading.  This isn't a movie where the clever yet dead eyed lead is dropping his pants for the girl, quite the opposite.  The title is repeated like a manta, which brings up the John Hughes quality, but Bart plays such a minor part in the movie, other than to represent how the dweeb of the school is cooler than the lead character.Other than that, I found the movie very humorous.  My boyfriend laughed every time he saw William H. Macy, with his high hair.  He's more into the dysfunctional family comedies than I am.  The actors are what drew me to this film.  I enjoy Alia Shawkat's work in Arrested Development and she fits well here, playing the best friend of the male lead who thinks it would be cool to go to the prom with him, while he has other ideas. I even spotted two people I loved on the show Scrubs, Kate Micucci and Cheryl Hines.  Jennifer Tilly even makes a short but memorable appearance.The plot is pretty straight forward.  Guy from standard movie fare dysfunctional Jewish family wants to make his prom special by buying a hotel room, limo and everything else for his prom.  The only problem is he doesn't have a girlfriend and his parents are pushing him to take his best friend.  The guy has other ideas and  haphazardly makes his way from one girl to another, trying to seal the deal.  At the end, which is funny, because it does remind me of Scrubs, a voiceover ending makes it a much deeper affair, where he ends up learning about himself and life.The music really does help the movie along.  I remember a John Hughes like music cue at the end of a class room scene where the lead is trying to ask a girl out based on an erotic poem she wrote. There is the traditional slow walking hot girl scene.  Bart, himself, reminds me of the climax of a Hughes scene, the punch line.  Bart is just not strong enough to give the film its title.  I wish he was.  Other Hughes like items are when the women leaves the restaurant suddenly.  Or when the old lady comes to the door with cookies.Despite any flaws it has, Bart Got a Room, is a good solid film.  It made me laugh and if you like offbeat silly comedies with more meat in them than your average teen film, then this would be for you.  I could probably watch it more than once and I keep reading about how there is something at the end of the credits, so maybe I should watch the end again.",Bart Got a Room

89607,"The movie itself is a 5-star movie but I can only give this release three stars because of the simply horrid transfer afforded it. Until Amazon comes up with a different rating system that allows us to grade the technical quality of the product (transfer etc) and the product itself (the movie) I have to give it a lower score than the movie deserves.The movie features Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man falsely accused of the murder of his wife. Escaping from captivity a manhunt is launched for Kimble, led by U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (played in an Oscar winning performamce by Tommy Lee Jones). The ensuing action details Kimble's attempts to clear his name, all the while trying to evade his pursuers. Director Andrew Davis crafts a taught and exciting movie and delivers what is one of the best movies of the 1990s. But for all the movie does right Warner have seen fit to deliver it to Blu-ray in a transfer that is at times painful to watch with a soft and undefined image that contains large amounts of grain and is overall dull with a lack of detail. The Blu-ray fares somewhat better in the audio department however with a very active, if average by todays standards, track. Where Warner does deserve high marks is inclusion of all of the special features from the Special Edition DVD including a feature-length commentary track with Davis and Tommy Lee Jones that contains a lot of good information despite some long pauses. There os also a smattering of featurettes.Overall a disappointing presentation of an exceptional movie. Here is hoping that Warner revisits this title soon",The Fugitive
457135,"I don't know how this one ever got past my radar, but I'm glad I finally discovered it. It was quite by accident. My mom and I were sitting watching one of her ladies' channels (Oxygen or CO2 or some such silliness), and I remarked how much the story was like Cinderella. (We had missed the beginning, when the narrator, a female descendant of Cinderella's, explained to the Brothers Grimm that this was the real story behind their fairy tale.) Well, it was delightful. It had humor, adventure, romance, villainy, gorgeous sets and costumes, a top-notch cast - pretty much everything. If it hadn't been for Shakespeare In Love and Saving Private Ryan dominating the Oscars in 1999, Ever After probably would have taken some of the statuettes for cinematography, art direction, sets and costumes.Nevertheless, it's two stars, Drew Barrymore and Anjelica Huston, did win awards for their acting (not at the Oscars, but at other award ceremonies), which were well deserved because both women are terrific. Ms. Barrymore is the perfect Cinderella (Disney's 1950 animated version notwithstanding), although in this tale she is known as Danielle. And Ms. Huston (The Royal Tenenbaums, Mists Of Avalon) is perfectly mean, in a delectable sort of way, as the step mother. As with the Brothers Grimm version, there is no fairy godmother in the story; but there is Leonardo da Vinci, who, in my opinion, serves a much better purpose: he provides magic without it being unbelievable, and it is Patrick Godfrey (The Count Of Monte Cristo) who does the honors. I mean, pumpkins turning into coaches and mice becoming footmen? What was Charles Perrault, the 18th Century inventor of those fantastic elements, thinking?!Prince Henry, who is smitten by and then pursues Cinderella, is played by newcomer Dougray Scott. (He later starred in Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde and The Ten Commandments.) Scott does an admirable job balancing swashbuckling tendencies with boredom. It is his boredom that Cinderella challenges. She can't believe how complacent he is, considering how much responsibility he will have as the future king of France; and he can't get over how passionate, committed and alive she is. Writers Susannah Grant, Andy Tennant and Rich Parks have done something at which most modern screenwriters fail miserably: they've given us a compelling story about characters that are full of wit and charm, whom we honestly care about, and whose fortunes are in the balance until the very end.Like most classic fairy tales, Cinderella contains a timeless lesson that we never tire of hearing: that virtue wins over circumstances. Even though Cinderella is persecuted by her step mother and one of her step sisters, she overcomes this through perseverance, her concern for other people and her love of life and living. I like this version of the tale far better than Perrault's, which uses magic to rescue Cinderella, and is therefore difficult to relate to real life; and that of the Brothers Grimm, which contains some very grim elements indeed (like the step sisters cutting off parts of their feet in order to fit them into the glass slipper, and birds pecking out their eyes), making it equally unbelievable.Cinderella has been made into countless stage and screen productions, including the 1957 Rogers and Hammerstein TV musical starring Julie Andrews; the 1965 TV musical starring Lesley Ann Warren; and Stephen Sondheim's 1987 stage musical, Into The Woods, starring Bernadette Peters (based on the Grimm version and encompassing other fairy tales as well) - not to mention all the operas and ballets. But this latest version is, in my opinion, one of the best.The director of Ever After, Andy Tennant, has done a remarkable job weaving all the fascinating elements of both story and production together. Even more remarkable is the fact that most of his work has been for television, and this does have a certain made-for-television feel to it. But not only is it far, far better than most made-for-television movies, it out-shines most theatrical films. As a comparison, I think most viewers will find it to be at least one star better than Princess Bride, a film that is similar only in its storybook nature. I actually found myself reminded of First Knight more than any other film; although, again, this one is far better. For a good story that will capture your imagination and heart, and which the whole family can enjoy, Ever After is a charmer.Waitsel Smith",N/A
1068023,"I originally saw ""Flags of our Fathers"" in DVD format.  At that time, there were no special features available.  The film is very faithful to the book of the same title.  Critics have said that FOOF portrayed the Iwo flag raisers in a poor light.  What FOOF showed quite elegantly was that we are all flawed human beings.  These men, who did NOT believe they were heroes were immortalized by Joe Rosenthal's famous photo.Letters from Iwo Jima (LFIJ) is a poignant film telling the story from the Japanese side of the invasion.  We do not like to think kindly of our enemies.  It is far easier to kill then when they are Japs, Nazis or Gooks (a term that originated in Korea and persisted through Vietnam.  Gook is actually a corruption of the Korean term Han Guk where Han stands for Korea and Guk stands for person.  Similarly, Nihon Jin is Japan person and Junguo Ren is Chinese person.  Jin, Guk and Ren are the same Chinese character in all three languages).  But I digress....)  It is hard to see a sympathetic side to our enemies.  Combatants of all nations went to war for the same reason, patriotism and their governments sent them there.  LFIJ shows the human (and sometimes inhuman) side of our enemy at Iwo.The additional film, ""Heros of Iwo Jima"" tells the true stories of some of the really heroic actions during the invasion of Iwo Jima.  Remember, the characters portrayed in Flags of our Fathers never saw themselves as heroes.  They were the unfortunate victims of an American propaganda effort to raise war bonds.Now the FOUF and LOIJ DVD's have making of and other special features.Last but not least, this will be a lasting tribute to Clint Eastwood's production and director career.  He has come a long way from Fistful of Dollars and Dirty Harry to be come a prime influence in Hollywood movie history and achievement.Thank you.",N/A
202182,"This film may have been originally intended as ""left-wing propaganda,"" as some reviewers contend...or not. It may just be Costa-Gavras's simplistic worldview that is not necessarilly left or right wing but definitely victim-centric.It's essentially another example of being dumb enough to get into something WAY over your head and not surviving to tell about it.Charles/Charlie Hormann (Charles to his dad, Charlie to his wife) lives, writes and snoops around in a South American country (Chile, maybe! wink wink) that is imploding with civil war--a military regime has just overthrown the kind, compassionate Marxists who were most recently in power. Charlie, when not working on his illustrated fable starring a duck (yes, he's sensitive and artistic), takes a little road trip and runs into a guy who may as well be wearing a t-shirt that says, I AM A CIA ASSASSIN. (""Here's my card, in case you want someone whacked."") Charlie pesters this person with questions of a political nature, clumsily trying to get information about the coup but instead marking himself as a troublemaker.Because the CIA usually knows what it's doing, Charlie then disappears. COULD IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS STUPIDITY? As it happens, yes.His dad flies down, and this is really the best aspect of the film: Jack Lemmon is great. Mr. Hormann at first gives the American government--represented by embassy personnel--the benefit of the doubt when they, Sergeant Schulz-like, claim to know NOTHING. But it eventually becomes obvious that they're just trying to be nice and cooperative until Mr. Hormann goes back home--which only makes Hormann more determined. (His daughter-in-law/Charlie's wife, Sissy Spacek, treats the authorities with cynicism and hostility,and Hormann eventually begins to see that she has her reasons.) Eventually Mr. Hormann has to admit to himself that his country's representatives may be up to no good, and that Charlie was indeed the victim of foul play.Your heart really goes out to Lemmon when he tells the ambassador, ""I just want my boy back.""But sympathy for Charlie? I didn't have much. This is the equivalent of a person who wants to go swimming in shark-infested waters, even though everyone around him warns him not to, and he just INSISTS, and then of course gets eaten...okay, is the shark the bad guy here?Thousands of young people disappeared in Chile when the movie takes place, and yes, American hands were bloodied in that upheaval. At the same time, there were sound reasons to try to contain Marxism in this hemisphere.  The ends don't justify the means, but this is the way Chileans played the game on their own turf, so I don't know how much input or control our guys actually had.Charlie learned the hard way that you don't poke a stick into a hornets' nest. And the ""I'm an American"" entitlement argument? If you're an American, you should know better than to assume safety while traipsing around 3rd World countries on the verge of collapse.",Missing VHS
960450,"***Warning: this review may contain spoilers ***At the beginning of 'History of Violence', we meet two vicious killers who murder three people in a motel including a young child. Director Cronenberg immediately cuts to his protagonists, the Stall family, so I thought this was going to end up as another 'Desperate Hours', home invasion type of flick, with the bad guys invading the family home and perhaps terrorizing them or taking somebody hostage. Refreshingly, for a few moments at least, Cronenberg goes in another direction. The bad guys are dispatched by the principal protagonist, Tom Stall, played by Viggo Mortensen. It turns out that Stall has tried to erase his past life as Joey Cusack, a Mafia hoodlum, and has assumed a new identity in an idyllic Indiana town. But at the critical moment, while working at his place of business, a family diner, he's able to use his past skills as a made man and blows away the killers. As a result, he becomes an instant celebrity and becomes the subject of media scrutiny.Unfortunately, beyond this point, not a lot makes sense in this film. For starters, Cronenberg admits that the media scrutiny is only a local phenomena. The truth of the matter is that such a story would not remain a local event but would be covered nationally as well as on the internet. After Mafia boss Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) shows up on the scene, folksy Sheriff Sam Carney does some 'research' to try and find out whether Fogarty is telling the truth that Tom has been leading a double life. For some reason, he's only able to find out about Mafia boss 'Ritchie'--there's no mention of Joey anywhere. Now why is that? A Google search would have certainly brought up information on the brother of a well known mobster such as Joey who police are aware ripped Fogarty's eye out. Furthermore, once the media found out about Tom the hero, there would have been intense scrutiny about his background leading to the discovery that Tom is not who he says he is.Now what about the ridiculous scene where Tom ends up seeing Fogarty's car and assumes it's heading out of town to his house to do harm to his family? Why does he start running all the way home? If he believed that the mobsters were going to hurt his family, wouldn't he have 1) called Sheriff Sam immediately and 2) grabbed a car or got one of his employees or friends to drive him home right away? Why do the mobsters attempt to induce Tom to come with them? He's standing right out on the lawn when Fogarty or one of his two henchmen could have went right up to him and shot him in the head? For that matter, if they wanted to, they could have killed the whole family right then and there.What exactly happened to Fogarty and his henchmen after Tom and Jack blow them away? We never see the police arrive and the bodies being taken away. Wouldn't there have been even more media interest which certainly would have led to the discovery that Tom was connected to the mobsters in the past? All we see is the Sheriff come over and make some meek inquiries as to Tom's background.While we find out next to nothing about Ed Harris's Fogarty, the same goes for brother Ritchie. They are both stereotypes of the typical Mafiosi. Cronenberg resorts to making Ritchie into a buffoon and admits that he didn't use a soundtrack during the climactic scene where Tom dispatches his brother and his minions in order to play up the comedy. Another stereotype is the school bully who is constantly harassing son Jack. How many times have we seen this type of character in poorly written films? Even worse, the bullying isn't even convincing (would a bully pick a fight just because a guy catches a baseball and the game is over?) In order to 'humanize' his principals, Tom and Edie, Cronenberg pads his film with overlong sex scenes. Worse is his obsession with showing all the blood and guts that are spilled whenever someone is shot. There's even an absurd 'DVD extra' which shows contrasting American and International versions of a scene focusing on the amount of blood that spurts out of a victim's mouth.While technically Cronenberg is a highly competent director who is able to get decent performances out of his actors, the script he's working with is amateurish. Ironically, History of Violence has little 'history' in it at all. Instead, it's a sordid tale of redemption in which a reformed man must defend himself against one-dimensional straw men who we neither care or know next to nothing about.",N/A

1164977,"The director takes a long lens to a small place and produces a very big film. A class of primary school children on an island in the Inland Sea receives a new teacher in 1928. Over the next twenty years of economic depression, world war and costly peace, we see the relationships begun that day trailing in a dozen directions, like streamers in the wind, held together by a woman who struggles, learns and suffers along with them. This is not epic film-making, but it is powerful and often very beautiful. Even in black and white, the scene in which the young teacher leads her pupils weaving and singing through a grove of sakura in bloom (she is the locomotive to their carriages) is quite unforgettable.The film's ambitions, however, are at the root of its weaknesses as a creative statement. Kinoshita takes the story to places beyond the scope of its ideas and sentimental style. In a sense, he loses control of the narrative, and this is felt most keenly during the last 20 minutes, as he wrestles with a resolution.Kinoshita gives his main character a political awakening - invites questions from the audience - but fails to go anywhere with it. The events that wash up onto the teacher's small island and carry away the lives of her former pupils - injustice, depression and war - are like night-mists that come and go, withering the crop, yet never seen. The one, overt, hostile act of authority - police interrogating a teacher for having a ""subversive"" magazine - is talked about but not shown. The sole authority figure in the story, her headmaster, is a genial ""uncle"". How is it, then, that children are dying of preventable diseases and being sold into servitude at the age of 12 or 13; how is that innocent folk songs have been replaced by patriotic military chants; how come the graveyard is now filled with would-be fishermen and farmers-turned-soldiers? What political agency was responsible?The film's medium is tears, not political discourse, but it is too good a film not to be concerned with the larger questions. In the case of the main character, we are left with little more in the way of an answer than her off-repeated mantra, ""nobody's fault"" - a phrase, incidentally, that Charles Dickens used in ""Little Dorrit"" to satirise the complacency of his age. Kinoshita is anything but a satirist.  Though we should not wish a film to be something it does not aspire to be, there are themes incipient in this work which deserved a braver treatment.Takamine Hideko, a great actress, is quite wonderful as the sympathetic teacher.",Twenty-Four Eyes

1265166,"""Jerichow"" revisits James M. Cain's ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" in a rural and economically stressed area of Germany. Writer/director Christian Petzold seems to have been inspired to some degree by both of the famous film adaptations of Cain's novel, the noir classic ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946) and Italy's unauthorized ""Ossessione"" (1943). But ""Jerichow"" isn't a remake. It's a German update that looks at commercially successful Turkish immigrants and Germans who are inspired to reckless and secretive behavior, perhaps to recapture some optimism at a point in their lives when they realize things haven't gone as planned.Thomas (Benno Furmann) is back home after serving in the German army in Afghanistan, now in need of a job to begin renovations on the house his recently deceased mother has left him. Ali Ozkan (Hilmi Sozer), who owns 45 snack bars in the area, asks Thomas to make his daily rounds of deliveries for him when his driver's license is suspended for DUI. In spite of his heavy drinking, Ali is an demanding and perceptive businessman. He seems to want Thomas to learn the business, and he encourages Thomas to get to know his pretty German wife Laura (Nina Hoss). But Thomas and Laura see something of themselves in each other and find the attraction irresistible.This is old territory, but it usually doesn't feel like it. The characters befit their particular time and place. All are criminal in some sense, and all are sympathetic in some sense. We don't get to know Laura well until late in the film, but the uneasy relationship between the two men develops over course of the film. Their mundane conversations create suspense, as the audience gets the creeping impression that things will turn out badly. Both men are enigmatic, frustrated, and hiding something that will have to give at some point. Kudos to Hilmi Sozer for making Ali a fully realized character, perhaps even more tragic than the rest, even though he is not a protagonist. In German with optional English subtitles.The DVD (Cinema Guild 2009): Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min), trailers from 3 other Christian Petzold films, and a ""Making-of Documentary"" (25 min).

This movie interestingly blends elements from John Badham's WarGames and Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much with today's technological,political,and social realities. Could it have been better?Yes. Director D.J. Caruso may have sacrificed some of the movies dramatic potential to thriller and action formulas. But I still think the end result was very good. I found the scenes between Jerry and Rachel on the bus and in the freighter to be particularly charming.

386579,"Jim Jarmusch's DOWN BY LAW is one of the arthouse productions that the American director made his name with in the 1980s. As the film opens, we see how a small-town pimp (John Lurie) and an itinerant DJ (Tom Waits) get themselves arrested after they've each accepted a job from a seedy friend. They subsequently end up sharing a jail cell, into which one day an Italian immigrant (Roberto Benigni) is also placed. The plot of the film is the developing camaraderie between these three men. The Italian's bumbling antics act initially aggrevate his cellmates -- Benigni's role serve as comic relief against the morose behavior of the other two characters. DOWN BY LAW begins as a drama portraying the underbelly of a Louisiana town, but by the end it has transformed into absurdist comedy.Lurie's acting is fine, representing his character convincingly as a pathetic d-bag. Benigni might seem like he's playing himself, but his English is reputedly much better than the broken phrases he offers in the film. Nicoletta Braschi appears as the Italian's love interest, a role that must have been easy to play since Benigni and her are married in real life. I've never thought Tom Waits was a great actor, however.This is an entertaining film, with many fine touches. If I rate it less than a full five stars, it's just because I can't completely get into these black and white portrayals of contemporary lowlifes (I have a problem with early Kaurismaki for the same reason--his aesthetic was very similar to Jarmusch's.)",Down By Law VHS

I think I chuckled once and it was so fleeting that right now I couldn't tell you what it was! Even the out takes during the credits were dumb. I am glad, however that I only rented it on my TiVo and didn't pay the money to purchase the film. Unless you can see it for free, I'd pass if I had to do it again.",N/A
1223785,"New Moon, the second installment in the Twilight Saga movie series, is by far the greatest movie sequel I've ever seen. The movie is a stunningly beautiful, exquisitely acted and excellently-produced film which is gripping, compelling, absorbing and immensely pleasurable from beginning to end.The entire cast of actors and actresses were utterly excellent. It is hard for me to believe that young men and yound ladies this young can act so well, but Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, and especially Kristen Stewart, and the rest of the cast, were simply impeccable. As a film connoisseur, I would actually describe Kristen Stewart's performance as Garbo-esque or Meryl Streep-esque. I think Stewart deserves at least an Academy Award nomination, and I say that in all seriousness. I am captivated by her performance. Not only is she stunningly beautiful in her fragile demeanor and light complexion, but her mannerisms, gestures, inflections, pauses, dialects, vocal expressions, and line delivery couldn't be more perfect and consistently pleasing in my opinion. I don't think I've ever seen a finer performance for a similar part, and no other actress in my opinion could have done it better.Pattinson's performance was also superb. I think he conveyed Edward's inner conflicts and concern and love for Bella so well. I loved it when he made his first appearance at Forks High and strolled over to Bella from his car. I love watching great actors and charismatic people like Robert. He captures Edward's sophistication, worldliness, charm and sense of humor perfectly.Taylor Lautner was great as well. More than great. He simply ""delivered"". I am so relieved the producers are keeping him for the sequels, because he really pulled it off--and more so! He went from an innocent, playful teenager to a tortured, beligerent, adrenaline-laced wolf-person and he made it totally believable and genuine. Also, his rapport with Stewart was perfect in their emotional, close scenes together. I totally believed everything Lautner did, and considering what he had to do in this movie, that's saying a lot.The supporting actors were also all great. Jasper's hairdos might have been over the top at times, but Jackson Rathbone was still great, and funny. I loved Peter Facinelli as Carlisle Cullen. He achieved a greater depth to Dr. Cullen's character than in the first film, even though he was great in that one too. I also loved Nikki Reed as Rosalie. In her monologue explaining to Bella why she votes No contrasted to when she tossed Bella her gift that Alice picked out, I thought she showed the full range of a distinctive character. It's not easy to play the girl who's supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Reed managed to show Rosalie's vulnerability and delicate/injured psyche.This review is hard because this movie is so good, and all the actors were so great, I would have to go over each actor one at a time because they all deserve recognition. I've been in love with Christian Serratos' portrayal of Angela since the first movie. I wish I could take Serratos out to lunch dressed up like she does as Angela, because Christian as Angela is one of the cutest things on the face of the Earth.This movie was just, ultra cool. I have to give immense credit to Chris Weitz. His work is worthy of a Best Director nomination, if not possibly the award. The entire production was simply beautiful, perfectly directed, perfectly designed, perfectly executed, I can't see a single flaw in it. The costumes, the superb make-up, the cinematography, the musical score. The songs chosen were good and complemented the scenes well. The songs kind of enhanced and commented on what was happening in the scenes that they were played in, which I thought was cool. The screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg couldn't have been better. After all, the writing is the most important element, especially for adapting books that fans are obsessive about.Oh, and I do think I should mention Billy Burke and Edi Gathegi. Billy Burke is perfect as Bella's dad. His performance is so understated, yet so perfect, but it's crucial that Burke can pull it off, because Bella's father is so important to developing and supporting Bella's personality and her background. And I thought Gathegi was chilling as Laurent. The scene where he is preparing to kill Bella, his performance was exquisite. The inevitability of him devouring Bella was so visceral the way Gathegi acted it. You could feel the menace and murderous hunger and thirst and amorality of Laurent the vampire. Then when he sees Jacob and his pack as the giant wolves, his shock and terror. That scene is so important to conveying the strength of the wolves and their ability to fight vampires. Gathegi's short appearance was superb. It framed the sections of the film around it and was a turning point in the story. The short sequence when the wolves rip out his throat later was great fx, btw.And I guess I should also mention that Ashley Greene reprises her role as Alice nicely. Greene is like absolutely perfect for the role of Alice. It's such a vital part in the stories, and Ashley Greene is the only actress for the part--I see her and only her as Alice, not any other actress or any other woman in the world.The Volturi were great too. Dakota Fanning as Jane had some pretty good lines. Those red eyes bug me to death, though. Michael Sheen, Jamie Bower and Chris Heyerdahl were ultra cool as the chief Volturi. Any actors who I didn't mention is only for space constraints and keeping this review from being a novel--I didn't talk about Anna Kendrick, Michael Welch and Justin Chon, Rachelle Lefevre, Elizabeth Reaser, Kellan Lutz, et al, but face it--if I listed every great character actor in this movie, it would be the entire cast!All in all, Twilight: New Moon is a worthy second installment in the Twilight Saga series. Really, it's miraculous that a sequel could be this good, usually sequels are terrible. Chris Weitz deserves immense credit for achieving it, and as Twilight fans we owe him a debt of gratitude and honor because he did our beloved series credit.I think Stephanie Meyers has to be thrilled with the way New Moon turned out. This is a beautiful, exquisite, elegant film that will entrance you and fill you with smooth and steady ecstasy, and it builds and crests from beginning to end, as all great films do. It is not to be missed, and although it probably will never be honored as a ""Great Film"" or ""Great Art"", it is just as good quality as the greatest films ever made (it's a hundred times better quality than Titanic, for instance, which won 11 Academy Awards) and in my heart it wins about 15 Academy Award nominations, and more than a few Oscars. I will be seeing this a lot more times in the theaters, you can be sure. Simply the best!*****UPDATE*****:I've seen New Moon a second time now (only twice, but only because I'm traveling!), and it's even better the second time around. TOTALLY AWESOME! This is the way movies should be made!I will be going a few more times before I leave town for overseas, but luckily it will be open in Asia in the next few days. Can't wait for Eclipse in June. If Chris Weitz directed that and it's anywhere like this one, it will most likely be a knockout. Absolutely tops!!!",N/A

It had everything a loyal Prince fan wanted. Prince close-ups, Prince changing clothes and of course Prince singing and dancing alittle to ""Girls & Boys"" ( a great song from the great album ""Parade"" ). I love that Prince made this film black and white and that its so not and never tries to be Purple Rain ( one of the greatest rock films ever! ). This and so many other reasons is why Prince is still making music and challenging his listeners. Why Prince is still inspiring other artists and imitaters ( you know who you are ).

1114670,"This is probably the most exciting set at the beginning because you know what's going to happen.  The first disc shows a concert used for the recording of Alive III, a film talking about the unplugged show, and then a complete version of the unplugged show.  The first disc is truly when KISS were at the highest point as a band.  They might have not had Peter Criss or Ace Frehley, but they had developed into a different band with Eric Singer and Bruce Kulick bringing out the past of KISS, without hiding themselves as individuals.  Finally KISS are developed into this band without the face-paint.  This is the era that several fans consider the highlighting point, and I can understand why.  They had a legacy, but they also showed how the times had changed.Their unplugged show alone is worth the price of all three boxed sets.  It's the complete unedited version of the one show where the focus was completely the music.  They had now pyrotechnics, no huge stage, it was just the four of them performing unplugged.  The show was already special, but what made it extra special was the big surprise that everyone now knows about where Ace and Peter joined for a couple of songs.  After a couple of songs with this line-up, the audiences aren't completely sure of what will happen, but then the original KISS and the current KISS at the time do a few classics.The second disc is a show from their reunion tour, plus their MTV VMA performance in it's entire form.  It might have been a quick performance, but it was still a good one.  That's followed by the first half of what I consider to be the ultimate KISS show.The show that the second disc ends with and the first disc begins with is truly the ULTIMATE KISS SHOW because they had their entire show, but now with newer technological advances, they could do things to make the show even bigger and better.  Gene performs above the audience, Paul performs on a stage in the middle of the audience, Ace Frehley's guitar flies off into space, and Peter Criss shows the soft side.After the big show, there's a really good quick show done at the premiere of the movie, Detroit Rock City, and then is a show from what was planned to be their final tour, but as they say in the commentary, they realized that KISS couldn't continue the way they were, but they could still continue.  The trilogy has the greatest ending that any concert boxed set trilogy can have.  However, there's one additional disc.The set ends with the first filmed performance of KISS.  The film quality is horrible, you can barely see them, and they barely had that many songs, but it's a great way of coming full circle.",N/A

1080400,"Rare made for television version of Bram Stoker's classic vampire novel,originally aired as a BBC mini-series in 1977.Over three hours long and surely an epic,this version includes most of the details of the Stoker novel,including Dracula's ability to climb down the castle wall,and yet sticking to cliches.An example would be that Dracula(as portrayed by Louis Jordan) has a look more modelled after Lugosi than Stoker.It's also Van Helsing who slays Dracula in this version,as opposed to Quincy Morris in the novel.Still,these are minor quibbles as the film sports fine performances(particularly Jordan as Dracula and an energetic Frank Finlay as Vna Helsing),beautiful on location shots and great atmosphere.It's unfortunate that they chose to film the Mini-series on Video,and used many outdated Video effects,but luckily they do not distract strongly from the story.For Dracula fans and Horror buffs,this DVD is a must.Note:In a bit of irony,it appears that the two most faithful versions of the two most celebrated Horror novels were filmed at virtually the same time.Calvin Floyd's ""Terror of Frankenstein"" was released less than a year before this film.",N/A
768073,"If you are considering buying ""The Tick"" and you've read through the other reviews and find yourself confused...please allow me to illuminate a little.  This review is for folks who really aren't familiar with ""The Tick"" and are trying to decide whether it's worth buying or not.  Any short comings as far as the DVD set itself have already been well addressed and documented here...this is about the show itself.  If you don't know much about The Tick, please read on....From reading the reviews both here and elsewhere, the first thing you might notice is that people either really love or really HATE ""The Tick""...there's very little in between.  From the other reviews you should have already gathered that The Tick is a parody...a (not always so) tongue in cheek spoof on the whole super hero genre.  In a world full of super hero movies that sometimes take themselves WAY too seriously ala The Xmen, The Dark Knight, etc., or were meant to be serious and were just poorly done, ala Spiderman 3, The Hulk, etc., The Tick is an off the wall poke at all of this.  There's no mind bending special effects here (other than Tick's wonderfully active antennae), the fight scenes are modestly shot with the occasional kick, punch or ""smoosh"" and the characters are...well...utterly unbelievable but in a very wonderful sort of way.  ""Captain Liberty"" for example...imagine Wonder Woman as being a sexually frustrated lady of the new millennium.  Sure she can kick butt...it's also why she can't ever manage a second date!  This show isn't about portraying ""super heroes"" in a remotely ""realistic"" sort of way, it's the punchline to the joke that the whole super hero genre really is!Now please...I enjoy a good super hero action flick as much as the next person but it's also nice to be reminded of just how outrageous this genre really is...at least if you think about it too hard! LOL!!!  People in their 30's and 40's still watching Batman?  You'd think at least a few of us would have moved out of our parents basements by now! LOL!!!""The Tick"" is for folks who don't mind ultra heavy doses of ""silly"".  If you are looking for intense drama or thought provoking definitions of good and evil...you won't find it here.  This is for folks who watch movies like the famed ""Godzilla"" legacy or the ""Airplane"" movies and who -ENJOY- just how bad some of those movies really were! LOL!  That's the genius of this show...it doesn't really take ANYTHING seriously.  When you keep all of this in mind and take it all at face value, you begin to see how truly wonderful this show is (as well as the whole Tick series as a whole, including the comic books).  You find yourself sitting there waiting for the next ""remarkably dumb thing"" to come out of the Tick's mouth.  It's exceptionally ""cheesy"" to the N'th degree...and it's supposed to be.As has been mentioned elsewhere, The Tick was a very short-lived TV series.  And as other's have said, most television executives wouldn't know -GOOD- entertainment even if it were the size of a cement truck and parked on top of them.  How an industry that embraces ""The WWF"" yet over-looks a true diamond in the rough is mind boggling. The Tick clearly never reached it's full potential but even ""as is"" it's still a wonderfully clever series for folks who want something that's MORE than just a little bit different.So if you want ""serious"" super hero action, save your money for the next mega-bucks box office thriller (and hope that the industry has learned from it's previous mistakes and/or complete disasters).  If on the other hand you really enjoy totally mindless entertainment with a wonderful cast and totally absurd situations ""The Tick"", despite any short comings of the DVD set (which considering how short the series itself was aren't many), is a wonderful investment with lots and lots of good laughs.

1267538,"""The dead have highways, highways that spill over into our world...""  This is the premise behind Book of Blood, Clive Barkers latest horror film based upon his short stories (Book of Blood and On Jerusalem Street).The movie is not as fast paced as Clive's last movie, The Midnight Meat Train (sadly with a poor opening - still sore Lionsgate, still sore!) a few months ago onto DVD.  This one revolves around a house which is believed to be haunted since at least two deaths have occurred there.  The house is the focal point for a Professor looking to make her mark in the world of the paranormal and acquires the help of a gifted young man named Simon whom she believes has a special gift that can allow the house to be ""opened up"" from its deathly slumber.  The film continues where Simon has now become the focal point of the film, trying to open the house's energy up for proof of the supernatural.  SPOILER WARNING! - towards the middle of the movie, we learn that Simon has been playing Mary for a fool and faked the first ghostly experience, but not the second as he later tells.He then comes back and demands to show Mary the truth - but the truth is ... that we learn that it has been Mary all along who has opened up the house - and we see what that opening looks like as the ghosts of lost souls wander out, inscribing their stories on Simons pale skin.  The story within the story (based upon Barkers On Jerusalem St.) features Simon who has now become a virtual book of blood and is being stalked by a Wyburd, a sociopath for hire who hears Simons story from his own mouth as he lays on Wyburds' ""carving table.""The film stars such notable actors as Jonas Armstrong (Robin Hood television series) playing Simon and Sophie Ward plays the driven professor who charges beyond all limits to unlock the secrets of the house.  Doug Bradley (Hellraiser) also makes an appearance as Tollington, the first victim of the house.As mentioned, this movie is not as fast paced as The Midnight Meat Train it does drag on in some parts, but does feature some very notable and quite effective scenes of gore and torture (including one notable scene where a girl is raped and skinned by a violent spirit quite soon within the movie).  It opens with the subsequent telling of introducing the premise by means of telling the story of On Jerusalem Street and continues through into Barkers Book of Blood and then ends quite nicely (and bloody) with On Jerusalem Street again.  There are several scenes of torture, blood, gore and scenes not of this world which will excite any fan of Barker and of intelligent horror.Now, the movie does have some draw backs.  It does draw on in some areas and does in points, have a less adequate ability of keeping the audiences interest until the very end.  In short, it is a ghost story with a handful of gore, torture and blood (lots of) mixed in.  This is NOT The Midnight Meat Train, this is NOT Hellraiser, but this is Clive Barkers' Book of Blood and with that alone you are guaranteed a journey through the dark fantastic that you will not forget any time soon.In the end, you are left with a feeling that you have just watched a movie that is unique, but not as quick paced and full of surprises as some of the other typical Hollywood horror films (i.e. Saw, Hostel, etc.).  It is, I believe, an upgrade from today's traditional horror film - The relationship between Simon and Mary also allows the film to work on another level as well.  Overall, Book of Blood offers a ghost story with a twist and in turns delivers a movie that offers just that - but could use more of a developed story within parts.  If you are looking for a movie filled with torture and gore (Hostel?) - This is not your movie.  If you are looking for a movie that offers a bit more than blood and gore, but offers a concrete story behind it with some thought and some soul (pun intended), than perhaps you may find yourself at one of those intersections and decide to invest in watching this film inscribe itself upon you.",Clive Barker's Book of Blood

1250443,"If you already own the VHS tapes from this series, the DVDs are well worth obtaining.  On DVD 2 Bonus material is presented with Master Yang demonstrating over 80 Taiji Chin Na techniques in slow motion and at full speed.  He categorizes these moves by the Eight Doors and Chin Na found in pushing hands.  This bonus material was not on the original VHS tapes of this series.The title, which includes the words ""IN DEPTH"", tells it all.  This series goes much deeper than other material I have seen from YMAA on the Taiji style of the seizing art of Chin Na.  As many practitioners are aware, Taijiquan has numerous Chin Na applications throughout the form.  Taijiquan is especially suited for Chin Na applications as the yielding and softness that precede the final application of Taijiquan is usually soft and misleading to the other person.  This is a perfect set up for applying a Chin Na technique.Chin Na applications are more effectively and successfully performed when the practitioner is able to establish the proper hold.  If a person tries to apply a Chin Na technique with too much initial force, then the person receiving the technique is alerted and with understanding can more easily evade the Chin Na technique.  Taijiquan can lead to a very well grounded Chin Na technique that is difficult to discern until one is completely under it's power.Yang, Jwing-Ming is involved in the teaching throughout the series.  Pascal and Julien, two students of Dr. Yang who were involved in demonstrating the Yang Style 2 man fighting set DVD, are two of the ""victims"" and demonstrators on this tape.  The other is Tony Chee.  I would imagine that anyone who studies with Dr. Yang would be knowledgeable in how to neutralize the effects of a Chin Na technique.  Yet, when you see the effect of Dr. Yang's techniques on these students, it only makes one even more aware of just how powerful and effective Dr. Yang's techniques are when applied to someone with neutralizing knowledge, much less a beginner.  At times, the students are able to obtain fairly effective results while demonstrating the Chin Na on each other.  Yet, the difference is obvious when Dr. Yang shows the correct way for applying the techniques.The applications and techniques are linked in a very believable manner to the postures in the Taiji form.  When the hidden Chin Na techniques in the Yang style Taijiquan form are are shown, there can be no doubt that these Chin Na techniques truly represent the many possible applications that exist in Taijiquan.  Many people think of Chin Na as a separate martial art, never realizing that many Chin Na techniques are a part of the majority of Taijiquan and Kung Fu styles.Dr. Yang shows the correct set up for each move and explains why each part of the technique is performed as shown.  Many teachers can display a technique and they can apply a technique, but few can explain how and why the technique works.  Dr. Yang is one of the few who shows true knowledge and understanding of the techniques and applications that he presents.One caution, a viewer will see Dr. Yang apparently continuing the technique even when the students are slapping their hand on their leg , which is generally understood as meaning they have submitted.  Unless one is very skilled at controlling the power being used, never continue the technique once your training partner taps out.  As you each become more skilled and better able to judge your skill, then you will be able to still hold the technique but lessen the pressure enough to avoid injury with your partner.  Always work out clear signals on what means stop, or what means don't go any farther.The basic concepts covered in each of the tapes area as follows:DVD 1 (19 Techniques)Techniques from the Yang posturesTechniques from the eight moving patternsClockwise Coiling in Crossed Pushing HandsDVD 1  (16 Techniques)Techniques from the Yang posturesTechniques from the eight moving patternsRotating, NeutralizingCounterclockwise Coiling in Crossed Pushing Hands (Yin Coiling)DVD 1  (21 Techniques)Techniques from the Yang posturesTechniques from the eight moving patternsParallel Pushing HandsDVD 4  (10 Techniques)Techniques from the Yang posturesTechniques from the eight moving patternsTechniques against Elbow Na in Pushing Hands (These Chin Na techniques were originally from the White Crane style, but Dr. Yang adapted them to the Taijiquan form.)Bonus material is presented with Master Yang demonstrating over 80 Taiji Chin Na techniques in slow motion and at full speed.  He categorizes these moves by the Eight Doors and Chin Na found in pushing hands.  This bonus material was not on the original VHS tapes of this series.Anyone interested in the fighting techniques of Taijiquan or who has studied Chin Na in other systems will enjoy and learn much from this series of Taiji Chin Na applications.  The techniques and applications so clearly presented on this DVD series offer a very effective self defense system to the practitioner.",Taiji Chin Na in Depth
210660,"It had a lot of jumps, sure, but I wouldn't say that this was the best movie out of the series. The cast kept promising that this movie was going to be more mature and not as corny, but it turned out to be no different from the original movie series. True, you have to have some of the old cliches or it wouldn't be Friday the 13th, but it also makes it unoriginal. I am a long time fan of this franchise and I can tell you that this wasn't the best, but luckily also wasn't the worst.One thing that bothered me in the movie was how Jason would be in the yard and then be on the roof of the cabin a second later. It works for zombie Jason since he has supernatural powers, or that you can believe, but this Jason is supposed to be alive! There is no way that he could pop out of all of these different places unles he had some portal I didn't know about and never show. Another thing is that Jason can take a hit with a sledge hammer better than he can take a kick in the face. It's kind of funny that he snaps hammers in half by blocking, but is slowed down when the main female character of the movie kicks him.What I did like about the movie was the few minutes at the beginning of the film with Nana Visitor as Pamela Voorhees. She was incredible with the few minutes she was on and did a fantastic Betsy Palmer voice. I almost felt that she deserved her own movie more than this movie. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It was  nice to see Jason return to Crystal Lake because this is where he belongs. Friday the 13th (2009) is the best movie since Part VII, but I was just disappointed it wasn't anymore original since this was a reboot. I'd love to see a really cool updated ""zombie"" Jason for the next film, and not the skinny giant from Freddy vs. Jason.",Friday the 13th 1 VHS
1027581,"Season 9 is, as far as I'm concerned, the second to last truly great season. After season 10 it started to go downhill, and while I probably will buy seasons 11 and 12 I probably won't go farther than that. Season 9, however, features one of my all-time favorite episodes, The City of New York VS. Homer Simpson, an episode which was temporarily pulled from sindication following 9/11 and heavily edited even when it returned to TV. Other favorites include Simpson Tide, although that could actually be a seaon 8 episode, and King of the Hill, where Homer is asked by the makers of the Power Sauce bar to climb Springfield's highest mountain, the Murderhorn. We also have such greats as Girly Edition, where Lisa attempts to start a children's news program only to get sidelined by Bart, who starts a popular segment called Bart's People, all while Homer buys and horribly overfeeds a helper monkey named Mojo.

1247031,"I'm sick and tired of the so-called expert critics trashing this sure to be classic down the road.Yes, it has some cliche scenes, but to compare it to Omen, and the Good Son-as I did originally) is an unfair observation, oh no, this girl has Mac Culkin beat. A friend and I saw this on its premeire night and really enjoyed it. We saw some cliches, but the twist was completely unexpected! Even watching the trailer won't tell you everything this time. You won't see it coming, even if you're looking for it.Anyone who finds this film funny totally missed the point, yes there are a few funny scenes, this film takes itself just seriously enough that you won't mind the cliches, and when the twist is revealed, you'll be like, what the....fill in the blanks. Unlike the Good son-this film can't be suggested for anyone under the age of 21, I don't care if it is rated R, even with young kids, this film is properly rated and is Not for kids. Any parent who lets their kids watch this under 21, would be making a mistake, a few scenes creeped both of us out-and he's a nurse! Go figure! Anyway, don't listen to the critics, see this film if you like the kind, but rent it first.March 9, 2010)I've just read some reviews from other websites trying to boycott this film-which failed poorly. I've heard it so many times, its almost become a mantra-it's only a movie, lighten up! The one parental organization trying to boycott it is so contradictive, not to mention hypocritical(check out Wikipedia, you'll see what I mean.) No one complained about so many other excessively violent movies in the past few years, so, until you watch the movie for yourself, you really shouldn't judge it so harshly. On this website however, despite the contraversy, I'm impressed with the overall praise it's received, so obviously most viewers saw it in its proper context. I'm not a parent myself by choice, but I know this a work of well-crafted fiction and wouldn't stop me from adopting, if I wanted to.",Orphan
176569,"When this movie first came out, we were still in the middle of George Bush's 2nd term and the war in Iraq was not going so well.  So many people, including myself, viewed this movie as Left-wing propaganda in Great Britain projected onto the political climate in the US.  In fact, I hated the film, as it portrayed the terrorist as the good guy, or maybe in this case, the anti-hero.  BUT, as I rewatch this movie in 2009 with now ~9 months of the Obama Adminstration in charge of America, I see this ""fascist"" portrayal of the UK as more of a reflection of the current Obama Administration.  YES...I said it.  The Obama Administration.As we see in the movie, V's overall motive and theme is ""People should not fear their government, the government should fear its people.""  Sure, the Hitler-like and militaristic methods of the UK government in this film are a bit ""right-wingish"" imagery (which I'd argue is incorrect on the fact that Nationalized Socialism is anything but ""right-wing""), BUT that aside, the policies of this UK government, like the stiffling of free speech, especially the comedic bit mocking the chancellor (oh, where have we heard that title before?  1936 Germany perhaps?) is exactly like what the Obama Adminstration is doing these days.  One example being telling a health insurance company to cease and desist their advertising campaign regarding the possible cut to Medicare.  Umm, First Amendment rights violation right there.  I don't care if the ad is correct or not, they have a right say it.And in the end of the film where we see a ""mob"" of people dressed in V's cape and mask ascend to the Parlimentary building to watch it blow up.  This is remanescant of the 9.12 March on Washington.",N/A
175554,"I don't remember when I first heard about this film.  But, it was at least at age five, a year after it was released to theaters.  Apparently, most people didn't think much of it, because it was viewed historically as a commercial flop.  A part of it may have been circumstantial, though.  Supergirl production was started hot off the heals of the rap on Superman III, a film that performed abominably in the theaters.  Pending who you asked, many people were starting to get burnt out on the Superman cannon, and they must've seen a teenage, female equivalent as a joke.  If it had been produced and released in between Superman II and III, that might've had a more positive, circumstantial effect.Here, Helen Slater stars in her first leading role as Kara, the Kryptonian cousin to Superman (official name of Kal-El) who left Krypton with her parents to live in the inner-space settlement of Argo City.  At the film's start, her mentor Zaltar (Peter O'Toole), incidentally the city's forefather, makes a mistake that forces a key power source, an omegahendron) to disappear into outer space, necessitating Kara's swift departure to rescue it, Zaltar's lifelong expulsion into Phantom Zone and possibly resulting in the whole city's eventual degradation.  The omegahendron surfaces on earth and, the little ball is snared by a narcissistic, pretentious and vindictive would-be witch named Solina (Faye Dunaway) and her jittery sister, Bianca.When Kara surfaces on earth herself, she discovers she has unprecedented powers of flight, strength, hearing and mater manipulation.  She uses an armband transmitter to detect the general location of the ball.  Eventually, she manages to disguise herself to conceal her attire.  Then, she passes as a student at a private university in a town called Midvale.  She passes as Clark Kent's cousin, Linda Lee and forges a letter of recommendation from him.  The headmaster places her with Lucy Lane, a sophomore who happens to be sister of Lois Lane and love interest of Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure reprising his Superman role).  As a coincidence, their math teacher, a man named Nigel is also Solina's erstwhile instructor of black magic.  He pursues her repeatedly, and she repeatedly rebuffs him.Meanwhile, all the girls at the school (including Linda) lust after a big, muscular groundskeeper named Ethan.  But, Bianca also catches his eye, as does Solina, who says he belongs to her.  Using a cheap form of black magic, she seduces him and tries to make him fall for her.  However, her magic goes badly awry, and his heart instead falls to Linda (after she changes to her true identity and saves him from physical danger).  Back in her dorm, Linda is forced to do battle with Solina's evil magic (as Kara) and comes out of this bout unscathed.  Then, she gets a signal from her transmitter that the omegahendron is functioning, and she tears off for the abandoned amusement park where the evil sisters reside.And, who should be waiting for her but Ethan, spouting uncharacteristic love poetry and brandishing flowers & chocolates for Linda.  The two are ambushed by the sisters, and Solina attempts to eliminate Linda, unsuccessfully.  Linda is forced to change back into Kara and carry Ethan away to a distant lakeside.  Solina eventually caves in and asks Nigel to help her eliminate Kara (whom she appropriately christens ""Supergirl"").  Nigel arrives at the park with a wand built for pure evil, which they use to lure Ethan back; Solina steals the wand, petrifies Nigel and creates a tall mountain with a castle on top in the exact middle of town.  Supergirl arrives in the castle to rescue Ethan, only to find herself imprisoned in a diamond-shaped piece of glass, which then expels her to the Phantom Zone along with Zaltar.  Meanwhile, she succeeds in subduing the whole community and seizing Lucy & Jimmy.at first, she doesn't know where she is, but she knows she's lost her powers.  When she and Zaltar come into contact with each other, Kara tries convincing him that they shouldn't let the Phantom Zone consume them and that if they don't try and escape, Argo City is finished and so is earth.  She uses straightforward teenage irony to finally win him over, and they push off for a deadly vortex.  If they can circumvent the perimeter of the vortex, they can get to a way out.  However, with the aide of her magic mirror, Solina spies on Kara & Zaltar and tries summoning elements of the Zone to kill them.  She succeeds in finishing Zaltar, who lets himself die so Kara can push through.  This she does, regaining her earthly abilities and flying straight through Solina's mirror and into the castle.  Supergirl manages to rescue Lucy, Jimmy & Nigel from the cages they've been sealed in and engages a battle with Solina's dark magic.  With help from Ethan and Nigel, Supergirl not only overpowers the magic but manages to create a vortex and shunt Solina & Bianca through the broken mirror and into the Phantom Zone.  Afterwards, things return to normal, and Kara is able to return to Argo City with the reclaimed omegahendron.I for one thought the movie was well worth watching.  I've actually watched it multiple times.  It didn't include Christopher Reeve, Margot Kitter, Jackie Cooper or Gene Hackman, but that has very little to do with the quality of the film.  It's an almost-completely new cast, and that does in fact add to the unacknowledged greatness of the film.  It did go kind of far when the character of Ethan mentioned the fact that Supergirl [and Superman] could ""leap tall buildings in a single bound.""  But, that was probably the only remotely inappropriate Superman reference in the finished product.There are only two real problems I've ever had with this film, and neither one of them could make me change my rating.  First, How does Kara find out that Superman's earth identity is Clark Kent?  Also, could someone explain to me where Solina could possibly have learned about the Phantom Zone, let alone send Supergirl there or manage to manipulate its elements?",N/A
1084130,"It's not completely awful, but it doesn't quite work, either. The ending is startling in the way it crashes to an abrupt, anti-climactic, well-that-wraps-it-up-and-thank-you-for-coming dive for the final frame; all the more startling because the rest of the movie tended to plod along. The robots and zombies are traditionally cheesy (as usual, the simple solution is to outrun them, which is trivial to manage, but too rarely accomplished by our hapless heroes). And despite the title, if you're hoping for screaming British babes in desperate circumstances, this is very much the wrong movie. No babes, and really very little screaming.If you have popcorn, and other viewers to help you cope with the plodding moments (and there are many), you might manage occasional flashes of amused oh-that's-so-bad, but there's no real suspense to be had here, and it's hard to care about any of the characters. The acting is, well, I've seen worse.

648924,"Happy Feet is set in Antartica in society of penguins who attract mates through song. However, Happy FEET is the story of a penguin who can't sing very well and instead dances (hence the title of the movie).However, the young penguin, Mumble, is laughed at and ostracized by his fellow penguins for not only his horrible singing, but his dancing too. However, after running into a groupe of ""hispanic"" penguins, a series of incidents occur and an adventure of epic proportions begins . . .Now personally, I did NOT like Happy Feet. Maybe it was the singing in dancing? Maybe it was the cliche message? I don't know. However, no longer being a kid, I'm trying to take a more objective look at Happy Feet. I'm going to start with why I liked the movie and then why I didn't like the mnvie.Reasons I liked (to a certain extent) Happy Feet:1) Robin Williams was hilarious as Lovelace and the little munchkin penguins . . . Though some maybe be insulted by little stereotypical (to a certain extent) penguins (though I doubt the kids would be offended so it's more the adults to look out for . .  .I suppose)2) The environmentalist message .  . . Kids gotta learn that their actions (littering being one of them) has impacts (sometimes devestating)on the environment and those living in the environment (such as the penguins)Reasons I didn't like Happy Feet . . .:1)The singing . . . I don't recall if there was a single orginal song in this movie . .  . .I don't know . . Maybe Warner Bros. movies just don't do original songs . . . .2) The other, more misguided message . . .Yes . .we should all learn to appreciate those who are different, but I don't think we should wait until he or she saves our lives first . . .After a person (or penguin in this case) saves a life, then one might say the person is now a hero/heroine rather than someone ""different"" who simply should be respected and appreciated for who they are rather then what they become (which in the case of this movie would be a ""hero"") . . .but maybe I'm just overthinking this . ..",N/A
280579,"Wow, this movie was so, so very campy.  Too think that dialogue this bad actually exists is truly amazing.  It only makes you wonder what people ever saw in Ayn Rand in the first place.

The set design was also pretty cool to behold.  All in all, this is a very overrated movie.  I mean, even Rotten Tomatoes gave it I think an 82%.

992201,"When I saw this film, I was STARTLED at parts of it. I cringed, blushed, laughed and was very touched at the end. BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A REAL DOCUMENTARY. After doing research--I discovered it was all scripted. The ""estranged"" son was the film maker! So it is nonsense when they see him at the end and are 'surprised', as he was ALWAYS around! That means the whole cross-country journey was also fiction (and completely unnecessary).  Online, the son claims the ""SCRIPT"" was created well before this all came to fruition.SO...it IS a good film, if you didn't know better--if you thought it was a real documentary. I was originally fascinated by it. But that was when I believed it to be real. Now that I know the truth...it has all the intrigue of that stupid 'Blair Witch Project'.  Why would I want to see it a second time? Why would I want to own it? It is ""fiction in disguise.""So I say forget this thing and get 'Grey Gardens.'  It is real, it is dear, and you will never forget it. I knew 'Little Edie' and you can be sure the film is the real deal.I give this film three stars because it DID convince me, before I found out the truth. And this means it must be pretty well done.

1164976,"I didn't quite know what to expect from this film ... but as the last of its 156 minutes played, I wished it could have been even longer, although that would have meant a few more lumps in the throat & teary-eyed moments. It's a deeply moving film, and its sentimental scenes are truly earned & not the least bit gratuitous or pandering.The story: a young woman begins her first teaching job on a small island village in Japan, with 12 students in her first grade class (hence the 24 eyes of the title). This opening sequence is charming & gentle, with the worst of the children's problems & woes easily mended with a few kind words & an understanding heart.But as the children grow older, remaining in touch with their beloved teacher over the years, the harsher aspects of life begin to take their toll. First the Great Depression, then the rise of Japanese militarism -- and the teacher can only watch, sick at heart, as promising futures are dashed & redirected by family & social pressures.While set in Japan during a specific period of history, the themes are timeless & universal, sad to say. When Japan continues its buildup to the Second World War, the patriotic songs & marches seem all too familiar -- as do the warnings from higher-ups in the school system that their job is to create obedient, patriotic citizens, willing to serve the state without question. It's made clear to our troubled teacher that any mention of other, antiwar possibilities are strictly forbidden, lest she be accused of being ""a Red.""Yet she does what she can, telling her male students that she'd be just as proud of them for becoming farmers or clerks or rice merchants, rather than becoming soldiers. The boys, of course, are caught up in shining visions of military glory & honor, without the slightest notion of the dark & bloody reality behind them.At the same time, she also struggles to help her female students become more than what family & society have prepared them to be ... not always successfully. Why does she struggle against such hopeless odds? Not so much for political or ideological reasons, but because of her individual compassion & spirit. These struggles even go on within her own family, as her husband is drafted & her own young sons dream of becoming soldiers themselves.Covering nearly 20 years, the film has an elegiac tone, a sense of memories washing up over & over again upon the same shore which opens & closes the film. Hideko Takamine is superb as the teacher, nicknamed ""Miss Pebble"" by her students, changing over the years from the fresh-faced young woman who appears in Western clothes, riding a bicycle through the shocked village, to the middle-aged woman both wounded & tempered by loss & grief, still refusing to surrender to despair.156 minutes may sound daunting, but don't let that stop you from watching this richly rewarding film. Most highly recommended!",Twenty-Four Eyes
179158,"Mitchum plays a great menacing guy and Peck is not bad as the lawyer trying to save his family.  The film's weaknesses are it's points of unbeleiveability, of which there are more than a few. Many things in the course of events are just too convenient and one just has to accept them rather than see how the characters actually acheived them - like when Cody follows Kojak's motorboat in a rowboat. Right. Or when Cody (Mitchum) drowns the police guard who barely puts up a fight, doesn't make a sound, and casually lets himself die - kind of insults the intelligence. But then if our hero had heard the scuffle the movie would've been over a lot quicker.  I could go into other things, but would give a lot of the film away.  Also some of the shots which are supposed to explain transition from one event to the next are too short almost leaving you to wonder what just happened.I wanted to like this film better than I did, and I watched it because I usually like black and white films from the early 60s.  What this does have in common with many films from that time is atmosphere. How much of that is due to it's being in black and white is open to debate.  Just as a color photo and a black and white photo of the same shot will give off a different charge, so too with the movies.  It may be partially for this reason that early 60s movies are so atmospheric though I'm not convinced that's the full reason.  There is also the sense of new things being tried, new ground being broken, etc. That's another reason I wanted to see this - to compare it with the remake.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars just because its old and its actors are famous. Even 4 seems high, while 3 seems low.  So 3.5 it is. Getting back to atmosphere - in spite of it's flaws the movie does succeed in wratcheting up the tension, although the low-beleivability factor and the somewhat melodramatic music periodically deflate that tension. For those who don't like to be scared, you can be thankful for small favors.",N/A
868789,"I hadn't watched this in years & well I have to admit, this movie is right up my alley, I very much enjoyed it for many reasons. I love the visualization, the scenery, the atmosphere, the fact that it is a movie based on the Golden Era of movies, as if it was shot in the 1930s, it was like an action adventure film noir meets Jurassic park and the Iron Giant. I loved the giant robots & the dino creatures in this. The story has Jude Law as Sky Captain along with Gwyneth Paltow and Angelia Jolie trying to save the world from a mad scientist. Ok its a little deeper than that, but for me it was the action,all the great scenery of where this chase goes from the city to ice to underwater to the jungle. It was also like an Indiana Jones movie too. It had everything needed to entertain, had a lot of action, acting was fine but these movies are made for non stop thrills and this delivered. I do have a passion for giant monsters,robots and great atmospheric scenery,so if you are the same, I highly recommend this movie. It is a lot of fun and a good mix of genres.",N/A

356009,"I remembered watching ""V"" when it first aired back in 1983. At the time this was reportedly one of the most expensive TV miniseries' ever made, and it's easy to see why. But in the end all the money that was spent to make this miniseries paid off. It was very well received by the critics, and it became one of the most watched TV miniseries' of the first half of the '80s.""V"" is the ultimate TV sci-fi extravaganza: aliens (who look like humans) from a planet far away come to Earth in gigantic, saucer-shaped motherships that hover over the world's major cities (most of the action here takes place in Los Angeles). Calling themselves the Visitors, they claim that they have come in peace, and begin to integrate themselves with the humans of earth. They also claim that they need special chemicals and minerals to aid their dying world. But strange events start to occur (ordinary people disappear; bizarre accidents happen, etc.), and some people discover that everything the Visitors have said has turned out to be a lie. A TV cameraman named Mike Donovan finds his way onto one of the motherships and makes a shocking discovery: the Visitors are actually lizard-like reptiles (which is revealed after the cameraman gets into a fight with one of them and rips off the aliens' human-like skin) who's main goal is to steal all of the Earth's water and use millions of human people as food. The cameraman joins a group known as the resistance movement led by Juliet Parrish, a female medical student. Their plans are to expose and oppose the Visitors. Their symbol is V for victory, which is spray-painted over the Visitors' posters that are posted all over Los Angeles. This resistance movement plan to fight for their planet. Their message to the Visitors: this is war! And yes, the ending clearly sets up a sequel (""V: The Final Battle"", which aired a year later).In my opinion, ""V"" (The Original Miniseries) is one of the very best TV miniseries' ever made. I just viewed this great science fiction epic again (on DVD), and it hasn't lost its touch. Extremely well written and directed by Kenneth Johnson, it's got spectacular special effects (for its time), exciting action, a terrific story, and lots of interesting characters that we get to know and care about. Best of all, the DVD transfer is superb (with the presentation shown in widescreen instead of full screen, which is how it originally aired on television since widescreen presentations weren't available on television back in 1983). Marc Singer and Faye Grant do an exceptional job in the principal leading roles of Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish, respectively. And there's lots of good work from the supporting actors, which include many actors who would later turn up in hit movies or TV shows. These include: Bonnie Bartlett (""St. Elsewhere""), Joanna Kerns (""Growing Pains""), William Russ (""Boy Meets World""), and Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies).If you like great sci-fi epics like me, then ""V"" (The Original Miniseries) is a must-see.",V - The Original TV Miniseries VHS

The scenery is fitting for this DVD also.All said, this DVD gets an A+.",Element: Ballet Conditioning
1257189,"Clive Owen is the greatest thing to come along in the Leading Man Department since George Clooney, and, come to think of it, Duplicity is a movie that would very much like to recapture the spark of that classic Clooney vehicle Out of Sight. Julia Roberts, on the other hand, is no Jennifer Lopez. Roberts has aged into a technically competent but utterly uncharismatic actress, and she plays an essentially unattractive character here unattractively. It's a role that really needed some of that old Roberts sparkle, but most of the time, she just seems old. The ultimate selling-point for this movie, then, is Tony Gilroy's script. Gilroy wants us awfully to see how clever he is, but this tale of double-crossing double agents really just plays like an overlong episode of the old TV series Alias, but funnier. By the time Duplicity lurches to its rather logically fuzzy conclusion, the final twist isn't nearly as surprising as Gilroy thinks it is. As a director, meanwhile, Gilroy wants awfully to be Steven Soderbergh, even resorting to split-screen devices and non-chronological narrative elements. But he just doesn't have Soderbergh's frisson. Among the supporting players, Tom Wilkinson is utterly wasted, while Paul Giamatti (although a little bit hammy and more than a little too young for the role he's playing) continues to demonstrate why he's his generation's finest character actor. Movies come alive when his funny mug comes on screen.",Duplicity
1208646,"From the moment Thomas Newman's soundtrack opens the film, you know you are in the dark suburban underworld of Alan Ball. Much likeSix Feet Under, Towelhead explores dysfunctional family relationships as experienced through the eyes of a 13-year-old Lebanese-American girl.Many of Ball's familiar themes are present here - sexual awakenings, sexual deviance, abusive families - and as usual he handles the themes with an uncomfortable sensitivity. There are plenty of moments which you'd rather not be sharing with the troubled characters, but the film compels you to watch.The film medium perhaps suits Ball's subject matter better than TV. Where Six Feet Under often threatened to destabilize its credibility with the implausible bad luck that his central characters endured, Towelhead manages to maintain its focus, offering up a tenderly traumatic, and darkly humorous story of Jasira's coming of age into an increasingly sexualized world.",N/A
1065280,"I've watched this movie several times, mostly to pick out all the scenes from my beloved hometown of Huntsville, Alabama.  It shows this place for what it is...a gorgeous, culturally diverse, upscale city.  The exterior shots show off my hometown wonderfully (and it all really looks like that, except we don't have a restaurant on the roof of the Times building).The setting and the eclectic soundtrack are the best things in it.There are some wonderful actors trying their best with almost no script that matters (although Billy Dee seems half-asleep a lot of the time).Every reaction shot is at least twice as long as it needs to be, and most scenes are, too. It's one very slow hour and a half.My favorite scene is when a stunned, disoriented Billy Dee wanders into Melvins BBQ Place. After one of the locals tries cheerily to figure out what he wants or where is trying to go,  and is met with stares and gibberish--the local man switches to deep concern: ""Can I give you a ride someplace, man?""  Its just so honest and deeply Southern.It's still a popular film on BET and women's drama networks, and I can see why. It's ultimately about healing family wounds and choosing to reach out to those you love. It's also slow as molasses in January, and just as super-sweet.",Constellation
734260,"I'll get the bad things out of the way first. First of all, as we all know, the space scenes seem like they were generated on a video game. Oddly, a number of indoor scenes, at least on my copy, seemed kind of blurry and fuzzy until the camera zoomed in. Second, as much as I always loved Captain Sheridan when I started watching the show on TV originally in its 3rd year, it seems kind of jarring to see him in the role after watching the whole first season on DVD and liking Sinclair. It takes at least half of the episodes to get really used to him, and even by the end, it seems like his comfort on the job seems a little forced.Those and a few other small things aside, this is a great show that seems to do a wonderful job of weaving together individual stories and an intriguing story arc. Each episode has its own entertaining or thought-provoking themes, while at the same time keeping you on the edge of your seat as far as the long-term storyline goes. In this particular season, we finally get some solid leads on where the series is going and who the major players will be. At times it seems like the overall plot moves slowly, only to give way to quick advances, like the whole Narn-Centauri war playing out in just a few episodes. Overall though, it comes out feeling about right. I especially like the character development among almost all of the major and minor characters, with the one notable exception being Na'toth, the Narn ambassador's assistant.In any case, this season is well-worth buying, and I'm sure most people will be hooked enough to keep watching the next seasons.",N/A

838946,"The moment this film opened I was overjoyed to be in the hands of a brilliant new film maker andfor any fan of serious film, this is a real thrill.  I can't come up with any more adjectives that haven't been exhausted by the hundreds of reviewers that have been raving about this film.I can share one story that will illustrate its powerful effect.At a screening for around 100 teenagers, I noted a real absence of any restlessness. When I turned around to observe the audience, they sat forward, riveted in unison to the screen. At the height of the drama, as one son climbs to the top of a tower, the DVD stuck. It froze.  The agonized scream of disappointment that came from this collective audience was the loudest I have ever heard, and will always stay with me. It was the greatest compliment young people could ever give a great film. They were with it heart and soul, and I'm sure you probably will be too.It gives us hope in the future of film.",The Return

391198,"This thriller is a bit rough-edged, but a lot of people like that sort of thing. Rebecca DeMornay was the at the top of her game around this time (early to mid '90s).On the plus side, this is an interesting and involving story, especially in the second half of the film. The movie is capped by a surprise ending I defy anyone to guess correctly. There are a few steamy scenes, too.The bad news is that there are no likable characters, too much profanity; a few minor holes in the story; and an obvious as sexist bias against men.  DeMornay's foul mouth and morals are pretty rotten for a psychologist, the character she plays. The guys, played by Dennis Miller and Antonio Bandaras, are pretty sleazy characters, too.",Never Talk to Strangers VHS

1238797,"This is a movie about one aspiring actors path through to the Bollywood bigtime. It is a very sharp and honest account of the Bollywood film industry (and probably all other film industries too). It is beautiful cinematography and should be appealing to both arthouse fans and those who like lighter Bollywood movies. There are a few Bollywood song and dance sequences but all in the context of scenes being filmed for movies. One of these has Hrithik Roshan strutting his stuff.I did know Hrithik had an extended cameo (which he does very well). What I didn't know was how many other actors walk through this movie (and often have a few lines to say)as themselves including Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Kareena Kapoor, Abhashek Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee, Vivek Oberoi, John  Abraham and others. So it becomes a bit spot the famous actors, producers and directors. It is just done so well.Farhan in the lead plays in an understated way but is very good. Konkona Sensharma as an actress friend also trying to make it, is also very good. They have strong support from innumerable well known Bollywood actors and actresses.The only real complaint was hard to read subtitles. Another reviewer mentioned white titles that got lost in a busy background. Our subtitles were unusually small so we had to pull our chairs close to the set to read them. I hope this isn't a sign of the times. If the movie hadn't been so good we could well have abandoned it early because of the subtitles.Now this movie didn't do that well in the multiplexes of India butelsewhere on the Net it can rate mostly 7.5 to 9.5 out of 10. Some of the theories about the Indian reaction were that it was too real and that Hrithik fans expected to see more of him than a cameo after his dance sequence was used to promote it. Anyway for me it's a keeper and one to rewatch.",N/A

The action is bad, the drama is bad and the acting is bad.  The story itself isnt half bad but the director blew it.  I watched this movie with three friends, two of whom had to go to bed before its conclusion.  How this got compared to the matrix ill never know.  To me it looked to be just another rushed attempt to make a film.  Taye Diggs really shined in this one though hehe.",Equilibrium

I read good reviews about this movie over the years so I rented it. I was bored. My wife would have been if she had not fallen asleep during the first 15 min. We turned the movie off after 1/2 hour. So I didn't get the hype. BUT, after seeing so many passionate lovers of this movie rate it 1 because of Lionsgate cuts, I'm wondering if that was enough to spoil the movie for the first time viewer.  Maybe it was. In any event, don't bother buying or renting this version of the movie. It isn't worth your time.",N/A
