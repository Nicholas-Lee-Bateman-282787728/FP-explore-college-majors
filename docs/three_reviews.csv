1134943,"The love story between the two gals is simply not believable because there is nothing prior to their ""awakening"" that indicates either one of them was physically or emotionally attracted to the other. Was Nina a lesbian when she first appears on the screen? Was Lisa a lesbian coincidentally working in the restaurant? No clues given. The director (Parma) was ultimately timid about the subject and the first kiss between Nina and Lisa is delivered without spark and passion -- and if there's more to being a lesbian than just two women kissing, you won't find it with these characters. The story of two women destined to find an interest in each other beyond their attachment to the restaurant lacks evolution. Finally, the pseudo-Bollywood ending was not only out of place, but it made whatever came before it absurd.",N/A
1637845,"The cult oddity ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" is one of those rare movies that I suspect will be a complete love-it or hate-it phenomenon.  Some will say the movie is a masterpiece of originality while others will decry it one of the worst movies ever made.  Just watch, I fully stand by this prediction!  For my taste, the movie is neither extreme.  This low budget endeavor is an obvious labor of love to its makers and cast, it has some genuinely memorable moments, but it never really comes together as strongly as you might hope.  I was really looking forward to ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" because the idea really appealed to my oddball sensibilities.  I have been known to champion cult films of this type (Larry Blamire films, for example, come to mind, especially the sublimely silly The Trail of the Screaming Forehead).  Mixing science fiction with musicals with sixties era juvenile delinquents, there is certainly no lack of imagination in director Paul Bunnell's vision.  But the movie is wildly uneven and as much as I wanted to love it, it never fully connected with me.The movie starts off on a distant planet as Johnny Xavier (Will Keenan) stands trial for a seemingly bad attitude and general non-conformity.  Banished to Earth with his acolytes, we next see the group (the self-proclaimed Ghastlys) dolled up like extras in ""West Side Story"" and stomping through the desert in pursuit of Keenen's ex.  On the run, she (De Anna Joy Brooks plays Bliss) enters a desolate diner where she meets up with a innocent soda jerk (Les Williams) and a ruthless music promoter (Reggie Bannister).  When Johnny catches up with her, the movie kicks into a ambitious musical number that serves to introduce the characters more fully.  The plot, such as it is, involves a space suit that gives it owner great power.  Bliss has it, Johnny wants it.  A chase ensues.  Meanwhile, the music promoter enlists Johnny's assistance in staging a big concert with an aging music legend (Creed Bratton) and all of the principles will unite at this event.  From there, things change once again and the rest of the picture is ANOTHER chase across the desert.I just realized as I was writing this that I couldn't concisely make sense of the plot!  And maybe that's some of the problem, the movie feels somewhat unfocused as it covers a LOT of material.  As a parody of delinquent films from the 50's and 60's, the movie works.  As an homage to science fiction of the era, the results are a bit more sketchy.  As a musical, some numbers have their moments.  The only knock-out performance, in my opinion, is Bliss's drive-in seduction scene which caused me to laugh out loud frequently.  Adding Bannister and Bratton to the mix, the story gets increasingly convoluted.  Perhaps the most challenging aspect, though, is a lack of character focus.  Is Johnny X a real bad boy or just misunderstood?  The movie wants to have it both ways.Individual components of ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" can be strong.  Kevin McCarthy and Paul William cameos are fun, Bratton (from TV's The Office) is amusing.  I loved De Anna Joy Brooks as Bliss.  But in the end, the many things that I liked about the movie never came together in a cohesive way.  I know what the movie wants to be, it just isn't as successful as I might have hoped.  Still, I'd recommend it to the right audience.  It's a small film just looking to be discovered by a faithful and rabid cult of followers.  But it definitely won't be embraced by everyone!

661053,"Vatel, Fran?ois (fr&Scaron;Nsw&Scaron; v&Scaron;tl)(KEY), fl. 17th cent., French chef, famous in the time of Louis XIV. Mme Marie de S&#x17D;vign&#x17D;,in her letters, speaks of him as the chef of the prince of Cond&#x17D; and says that on a Friday, when the king was coming to dinnerand the fish failed to arrive in time, Vatel committed suicide. The authenticity of this story is doubtful.-The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.2001.Playwright/Screenwriter Tom Stoppard and Director Roland Joffe have taken the Francois Vatel of historical legend and turned him into aquintessential French hero in this fabulous looking but oddly soulless film.  In France in 1671, Louis XIV is King and, as Mel Brooks might say : ""It'sgood to be the King!"" Fab babes are always ready to get their freak on with you and your nobles will do anything to curry favor.  So when the Princede Conde is informed that Louis and his court will be coming to visit his estate , Chantilly, Conde tells his famed steward Vatel to pull out all thestops.  Perversely, Conde, who is in desperate need of money, will have to plunge himself even deeper into debt in the mere hope that Louis willchoose him to command the royal forces in the coming war with Holland.Given a blank check, Vatel proceeds to put on the most sumptuous and ornate feasting imaginable.  There's a moment early in the King's visit whereas the King walks through the garden the scenery rises, collapses, is rearranged and fits together again like pieces of an elaborate puzzle--by itself thisscene is worth the price of admission.  It is remarkable.  As the visit goes on, Vatel must improvise when shortages crop up, must respond to theextravagant requests of the various guests, and must navigate the petty jealousies of the spoiled visitors.  He gets himself in a real bind when hedallies with the beautiful and reserved Anne de Montausier (Uma Thurman) who is both the King's latest favorite and the object of desire of the nastyand vindictive Marquis de Lauzon (Tim Roth).The caged bird imagery that Mr. Joffe resorts to is a tad heavy-handed, but the film nicely captures the stratification of society (though that does makethe relationship between Vatel and Anne rather improbable) and shows the degree to which everyone is subject to the whims of the King, who canmake or break you with the wave of his hand.  Gerard Depardieu as Vatel is appealingly earnest and his total commitment to his work raises it to thelevel of artistry.  He is so decent, and the culture around him so indecent, that we can understand why Anne is attracted to him, even if we don'tbelieve they could have been friends given the circumstances of the day, let alone lovers.Then the story takes a couple of odd twists, one that seems to have been pilfered from Ruggles of Red Gap, as Conde loses Vatel to the King in acard game, then one which matches the fate of the historical Vatel but which occurs for precisely the opposite reason.  In real life Vatel supposedlykilled himself for failing to serve the King well, here he kills himself rather than serve the King at all.  That seems too much license to take withhistory.The film received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Art Direction, but one wonders if so much energy went into the look of the movie that thefilmmakers lost track of the need to tell a compelling story along with the pretty pictures.  When the climactic scene of the film was going on it cameso suddenly and was shot so obliquely that, not knowing the background of the story,  I honestly didn't realize what had happened right away.  Thelogic they saw on their story boards didn't quite make it to the screen.  It's definitely worth seeing (and DVD is a must), but you can probably watchwith the sound off; it's intended to be looked at more than watched.GRADE : C+",Vatel
713583,"What's everyone getting so excited about?  This is nothing more than a soap opera where everybody dresses in Victorian clothes.  And unlike, say, Austen or Bronte, there's nothing deeper here:  just a whole bunch of adultery.  In Galsworthy's mind, there is apparently no such thing as love flourishing when it is permitted to do so:  to him, the only real love is forbidden love.One of the things I found infuriating was that the swelling violin music was implying that you're supposed to be sympathizing with the screwball adulteress, Irene, whereas when I was watching it, I was siding with the supposedly evil Soames the whole time.  From time to time he behaved dishonorably, I agree, but I felt that he was far more sinned against than sinning, and that he was the film's true hero.Alas!  The filmmakers didn't seem to agree and kept trying to get me to hate him, which rubbed me the wrong way through the film's length.And the director apparently never met a close-up he didn't like.",N/A

1016909,"The time is late 1948 and the setting is a U.S. Army post in Georgia, bordering on a forest preserve...A Southern amoral wife called Leonora (Elizabeth Taylor) finds a way for her stream desire in an adulterous affair with Lt. Col. Langdon (Brian Keith), carried on almost openly...Leonora gives aperture to her forcefulness and vigor in a passion for horses and riding... She is attached to a handsome white horse she calls Firebird and she provokes her husband by telling him that the animal is indeed a stallion with the emotional nature of man...Leonora's husband (Marlon Brando) is a devious, insecure, impotent Army major, a hidden homosexual preoccupied with an unsociable, lonely rider who canters around the field in the nude and whose sexual emotional stress is diminished, secretively, at the bedside of the major's wife holding her clothes and looking fixedly at her marvelous hot body...Private Williams (Robert Forster) is another lonely man fascinated by the fiery Leonora and her thoughtful and gentle comments to him... He takes to visiting the Penderton house at night looking attentively in the windows, observing with total recall and complete joy Leonora's nakedness, but also watching the Major in his study...Keith's neurotic wife (Julie Harris) is well aware of her husband's affair with Leonora but she only feels well from her close friendship with her houseboy, Anacleto (Zorro David), an affected companion who shares her penchant for the arts and is in every way the opposite of her abrupt, strong husband...Flavored with bitter insinuations and insulting sarcasms, Brando and Taylor's few scenes have enough flames to burn the silver screen... He's a tormented human being while she's delicious but shrill and insensitive...

565917,"This 1972 American International Pictures (AIP) production is low budget, with stock footage obvious at times. Continuity/consistency issues might be annoying to some viewers; Slaughter's marksmanship, for example, goes from lousy point shooting tecnhique (punching his hand toward the target) to barely missing a baddie in the unnamed South American country. (It was Mexico, obviously, but the production was not allowed to name it because of the host's fears of negative tourism publicity.)Decent soundtrack, though it doesn't live up to themain theme. The interracial love scenes were landmark. Career buddy-cop Don Gordon (Bullitt) does light duty here, but beady-eyed Rip Torn was sleazy and downright homicidal: a worthy adversary.

I only went ahead and bought this it while taking advantage of a great Amazon sale a few weeks ago in which I paid a very reasonable price for it. Fact is the episodes on this show are really flattened by the substraction of the classic music. The main title is specially ridiculous as the Happy Days theme has taken over ""Rock around the clock"" with the action cleary not matching the music.

797362,I watched this film because one of my favorite rides of all time is Disney's &quot;Haunted Mansion.&quot; I have to say the only reason I really enjoyed this film was for the special effects and memories of all those old spooky ghosts from the original ride at Disneyland.Eddie Murphy plays an overly ambitious real estate agent who ends up at the mansion with his family trying to strike up a deal with a few ghosts. The story is horribly hokey! The acting is silly and filled with typical Murphy antics: silly laughing and funny smiles.The best part of this movie is the special effects and the graveyard scenes. I found the movie to be a bit scary for children as some of the zombies are very &quot;real&quot; looking. For adults it is an evening of silly fun but sadly for young children they might spend their evening with nightmares instead of giggles!,N/A

524607,"Rules of Engagement is a gripping courtroom thriller that has a lot of plot holes just as soon as you start thinking about all the situations that occurred.  It has two things going for it:  terrific acting and fine direction from William Friedkin, and both elements are able to withstand the flaws.The film's best parts are in the first half hour, featuring two riveting action sequences, involving the jungle hell of Vietnam and the rescue of the ambassador in Yemen.  The rest of the film can't quite match this in intensity, but then again, that only goes to prove that Friedkin can stage an action sequence.The ending is when the film starts to lose steam.  No major revelation occurs, the entire trial moves in a straightforward, routine manner, and in the end, it feels anti-climactic, as if though nothing huge was accomplished.",N/A
1429013,"THE DESCENDANTS, though highly praised, could have been a lot better.  I am astonished that George Clooney was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, which consisted largely of running around looking tense or yelling at his teenaged daughters.  The plot was hopeful -- Clooney's character is part of a large clan that dates back to Hawaiian royal forbears and whose last big tract of virgin property must be sold or face bankruptcy, putting Clooney, as administrator, in a family fracas; and meanwhile he must face the fact that his comatose wife had been having an affair with a local man.  But not enough was done of this and at times when the film could really have dug in and had something to say, it grounds out in facile comedy instead.  While the film has its merits, including a wonderful turn by Beau Bridges as a dissolute clan member and excellent performances by the young actresses playing Clooney's daughters, the film is ultimately something of a fizzle--""Haole (white) as s--t"" says Clooney's character of his family's lifestyle at one point, and too much of that characterizes THE DESCENDANTS the movie as well.",The Descendants
862431,"The only reason I'm writing this review is because the trailer is misleading, and you may think you are picking up a psycho thriller, when you are really picking up a romantic drama.Let's put it this way, when my wife and I were discussing whether to get it, I was advocating for it, and she was against it.  After it was over, she liked it better than I did.From a marketing perspective, I think the promoters did not want this to come out as a chick flick, and they wanted young men to buy into it, but I think that blurred the movie's appeal and confused its audience.  It would have done much better if it was targeted more directly and squarely at women 18-35.  If you are in this core demographic, you should like this movie.

1456975,"I watched this movie last night after hearing all the hype and reading 1 star review after 1 star review. Sure, the core message parallels that of ""Natural Born Killers"": Western society/culture is destroying itself via the media & mass entertainment outlets. Thing is, the shocks are pretty much the only reason to watch it because the quality of everything but the prop, make-up, & art departments suffers due to a laughable script, so-so acting, a conventional music score & sound by the sound department (a few of the ""gross-out"" sounds worked though), and the lighting department did a so-so job. I'm a film buff/elitist, whatever you want to call it; I notice flaws and they bug me--that's just my taste & opinion.I know lots of people go for these types of horror flicks that are more concerned with the shock factor than the little things that add up to a well-made film; to each her/his own. Funny thing is, after the 1st few shocks I became desensitized towards the barrage of sickness, enough so that I began to find the film funny, like a blacker-than-black black comedy. The edge of realism they tried for turned into surrealism. That surrealistic feel surrounding the gore works against what (I believe)was the film-maker's goal: to have the movie as a whole be like a slice-of-life gone terribly wrong. Instead of making me feel genuine emotion towards the characters and their situations, that surrealistic edge gave me enough SAFE distance from them that I could step back from what I was seeing and think critically. If they could have found ways to remove that safety blanket between the gore scenes, so that I was tethered to the story enough to be unable to step back for a breather, I would've been deeply repulsed for the movies full duration instead of chuckling and shaking my head.The film-makers were obviously attempting to create a meaningful, realistic film with an important message, but due to the over-all lack of professionalism (exceptions to all involved in the amazing work with the gore)the movie goes from being a potentially important and artistic statement to falling flat as another typical shock flick that, while upping the ante on the limitations of pervasive gore, stays grounded as just another movie in the Netflix ""Horror"" genre because it, surprisingly enough, didn't take technical chances in how it was made to match the chances it took with the limits of gore. The script could've been helped greatly by running it through maybe 3-4 more drafts.All-in-all, ""A Serbian Film"" should be called ""A Serbian Movie"" or ""A Serbian Horror Flick"", because, unfortunately, those involved in its creation obviously placed all of the emphasis of their talents on the shock factor of the gore alone, versus putting in the time and effort to make the other aspects of the film stand tall with the blood & guts. A tripod falls down every time if it only has one leg fully telescoped. HOWEVER--if you get past the technical misfirings (if that sort of thing even bothers you at all)you'll probably appreciate this movie for the risks the people involved took (everybody whose name is attached to this movie will find their reputations forever changed, for better or worse);or, like me, you'll end up enjoying it as something outlandishly gross to watch a few times (don't see myself watching it more than once more on my own--too many better films to digest),or a ""shock token"" to show friends or bring to parties to witness the certain gross-out reactions. Hey, I can admit that it's FUN at least!",N/A

754204,"I too was very much looking forward to seeing David Suchet's version of Murder on the Orient Express.  I've never been a big fan of Albert Finney as Poirot.  Suchet's version was disappointing to say the least and doesn't even come close to the award winning Albert Finney version.  I can now understand why authors put clauses in their wills preventing people from carrying on their work.  In this case, somebody came along with a Christian agenda and heavily imposed it on the story line.  Poirot comes across as a cold, self righteous, and judgemental Catholic fanatic.  He is dark and unlikeable.  On top of that the filming comes across as chaotic, featuring choppy cuts and weird angles.  The other actors and actresses in the film were poorly chosen and just don't work well within their roles.  The movie just isn't very enjoyable to watch.I don't think Appointment With Death was as bad as some reviewers have described it, but at the same time it is clearly not one of Suchet's better Poirot films.  The Third Girl is the best of the three movies and is most closely comparable to Suchet's previous work as Poirot.As an unexpected surprise, the set does include a wonderful documentary of David Suchet taking a ride on the Orient Express.  He interviews staff about the train, including its history, and takes the viewer along on every step of his journey (including the meals he ate on board).  It was a real treat to watch.  It's a shame the feature film didn't compare.As an overall assessment, I would only recommend this set for loyal fans who have already purchased all the other Poirot sets (featuring David Suchet).Murder on the Orient Express:  1 star (out of 5)The Third Girl:  3.5 starsAppointment With Death: 3 starsDavid Suchet's Orient Express documentary: 5 stars",N/A

1494982,"Recently I watched the July 1986 Bregenzer Fest production conducted by Patane on the web, and by Jove, I like that one much more than this 2011 production, though also in Vienna!Viennesse audiences are probably too forgetful,especially the media, to hail this version as the best since Callas and Sutherland.Netrebko has more voice than Katia Ricciarelli in 1986 (a rather late period of the latter's career), but in termsm of vocal acting and drama, Katia is miles ahead of Anna.  Katia's singing is not only much more stylish (she has ALL then fiorature), her ability to shade phrases and bring out nuances are something that are so evidently superior to Netrebko's rather basic rendition.As for Seymour, Garanca is on par with Tocysz vocally, but notn dramatically.  Her Seymour is an rather insipid character, and it is difficult to figure out why Henry VIII would fall for her in Boleyn's stead.Nestrenko is, even if no longer in his vocal prime, a preferred King Henry over D'arcahgelo, who was ill in this performance, alas.The major difference between this and the Bregenz performance is the scene between Bolene and Percy.  In then Bregenz version, the Percy was portrayed ton great artistic height (not just vocal or muscial, but also dramatic) by Francisco Araiza, who sung all the high notes of the role without the slightest qualm, and gave the character of Percy such a colourful portrayal that really stands on full footing with the rest of Henry, Seymour and Boleyn, some thing that NO single tenor is capable of today!

684027,"After reading the reviews and seeing the sound bites of reviewers in the DVD package, I set forth to buy Bangkok Dangerous. I was expecting a ""hyperkinetic"" movie, as one critic put it and a cinematic style that's ""similar to John Woo and Quentin Tarantino"". I got neither. What I got is a languidly paced film about a deaf-mute hitman eager to redeem himself for a pretty young pharmacist's love. Actually, that's the most interesting part of the movie, how the hitman communicates his love to Fon, the pharmacist. The gunplay, action, the pacing and the camera techniques are nowhere near what critics are comparing it to. There's no gimmicky non-linear storytelling. No ""kewl"" camera work. No ""hip"" editing. It is not like Tsui Hark's Time & Tide with its visually-stunning camera work and dense storytelling, instead it is more akin to Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai. Quiet, a little profound. The story is refreshingly simple but it kind of drags on in the middle, plodding to the point of predictable, it makes you wish it has one of those twists Thai TV commercials are known for in global advertising awards shows. All in all, Bangkok Dangerous is a refreshing film to see amidst the noisy action films of Hollywood and Hong Kong. But don't get misled by what's on the cover.",N/A
942798,"Okay, so I want to say that if this movie hadn't been so hyped up I may have liked it more.  I thought it was decent for what it is, but oscar worthy it is not, all except a few supporting roles who seem to outshine the star whenever they're on screen.  Howard is an overrated entity, an actor with some star power that seems to be overhyped to the point that when you finally see him on screen your dissapointed because he just doesn't LIVE UP TO THE HYPE.  I hope he doesn't get the fifth slot at the oscars because his performance just isn't oscar material.  The movie as a whole carries a good value for us to see, that you don't have to stay where you are or feel that your place is confined to the life you live now...you can better yourself and you can rise above the prison you face.  DJay (Howard) is a pimp, hustler and drug dealer.  He has Nola (Manning in a great supporting role), his star ho and figuratize lil' sis and theres Shug (now here is the oscar worthy performance of the film...Taraji P. Henson shines here) pregnant and emotional and the light in DJays dark tunnel.  After meeting Key (Anderson), an old high school buddy he decides to try his hand at putting together a record.  With the help of Key and Shelby (DJ Quals who provides some laughs) he puts together a demo to show Skinny Black (Ludacris), the Memphis legend, once turning hits in his mothers laundry room and now rolling in the big leagues.  The film shows the fire in the eyes of those who want to be more than they are, and those that are wiling to fight to get where they need to be.  For a pimp who's shot down almost every step of the way DJay shows he has the fight to make it, but will he?  The film is decent, a good film that shows who you can be if you work hard at it...with some impressive suppoting roles and an impressive script.  My only complaint is all the hype...I sat down expecting an oscar winner and I got a popcorn muncher...Maybe it'll fair well at the MTV movie awards...It belongs there.  3 1/2 stars for me.",Hustle & Flow
561524,"Like most movie parodies, ""Scary Movie"" starts out well then begins to head downhill as it exhausts the possibilities of its limited material.  Certainly, few genres are as rife for self-satire as the teen slasher films that have proliferated in theatres ever since the early 1980's.  Seeing, however, as even some of the earliest ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" films seem like ancient history to today's core movie going public, ""Scary Movie"" draws upon more contemporary examples of the genre like ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" as its source of inspiration.  In its opening stretches, ""Scary Movie"" has a great deal of fun parodying the many ludicrous conventions that have long defined these films:  the use of 30-year old actors to portray empty-headed, nubile adolescents; the heavy emphasis on teen sexuality and partial nudity; the inane actions of the killer's victims who seem to do everything possible to hurl themselves into dangerous situations; and the oh-so-predictable false scare (usually caused by a leaping cat) followed immediately by the inevitable killer's attack.Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and boasting a screenplay concocted by no fewer than six (count `em SIX) writers, ""Scary Movie"" establishes a high speed rhythm and pace that the filmmakers manage to sustain through most of the film's 88-minute running time - though there is a noticeable tendency on the part of the film to lag in the last half hour.  Part of the problem could be that, as with most films made up essentially of sound and sight gags haphazardly strung together, it is inevitable that some of the bits will succeed better than others and that, as the movie rolls along, the inspiration will run a little dry and the humor will become less spontaneous and more forced.  Indeed, this type of movie genre parody has always worked best when applied in small doses on TV series like ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""In Living Color"" and even the ""Carol Burnett Show.""  Stretched out to full length, such concepts often suffer the curse of diminishing returns.Occasionally, the screenplay edges so close to the limits of good taste that one may question whether or not the material is truly appropriate for the age group at which the movie is obviously targeted.  The crudity is actually much more comically effective when it is merely hinted at than when it is so openly spelled out and displayed.  But then subtlety is not exactly a strong suit of the straight horror movie genre either.""Scary Movie"" is, at least, blessed with a winning, game cast made up of appropriately post adolescent actors who understand well the mannerisms and speech patterns of the stereotypes they embody.  The overall good-natured quality of the film and its fairly high laugh ratio of gems to clunkers make ""Scary Movie"" an imperfect but generally likeable popcorn entertainment.",Scary Movie
1042017,"Batgirl, that's what.I really did like the first season and I loved the second. So, I was really excited to see the third. I've never been a big fan of batman having a sidekick, but I did like the fact that they were bringing in Batgirl before Robin. That is something that's never been done before. The good stories are still there but the impact isn't. There are some very great episodes in this season too, probably better than any on the second, but there are also some that are just downright bad. Batgirl really did bring the show downhill, to me that is. Her dialogue is horrible, I know she is a kid, but it's almost like they keep trying to remind you with making her talk constantly. I will admit, about halfway through (The Laughing Cats), she did start to grow on me a little. She was starting to feel like she belonged. I guess the series just couldn't think of a better way to bring her in.I am also very very very tired of (I hate to say this) the Joker. His crimes in this season were horrible. I'm a huge Joker fan and loved the episodes he was in last season, but this time it seemed like they were just using him because he is the joker. The episode ""Brawn"" just seemed like it could have been a lot better if they would have just used Bane. We do need more of Bane, and I hope to see him later in the series. I was glad to see that they cut down on Penguin a little. Didn't like the first episode with him (A Knight to Remember) but I did like The Icy Depths a lot.I also liked the build up to Hugo Strange, and was very happy to finally see his character come out. I also did like the idea of someone going after Bruce Wayne.My Top 5 episodes were1. Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind- D.A.V.E was a great idea for a villain and to put Hugo behind it was even a better one2. A Fistful of Felt- A classic Ventriloquist story, with Strange pulling the strings.3. Thunder- The one episode that I did not mind Batgirl at all. Everything about this one just seemed right.4. RPM- A good story to introduce a new batmobile5. The Icy Depths- Even though I do not like this version of Freeze that much, he is in some pretty good episodes.So maybe after I watch this again, I might start to appreciate it more but at the time being this is how I feel about this season. Also please remember, these are my opinions and you may feel different. I would still recommend it for what good there is.",N/A

260364,"There's something about &quot;Beneath&quot; that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. The plot is pretty standard fare. Two astronauts (neither played by Charlton Heston) stumble upon that infamous monkey planet and discover that those pesky apes are STILL trying to wipe out the last traces of humanity. The costumes (not stunning in the prequel) look even more fake this time around. It's HARD to suspend your belief when the apes look like people running around in ape costumes!Then we get to the subterranean scenes. Our surviving astronaut meets Nova (expertly played by a scantily-clad Linda Harrison) and a cult of nuke-worshipping mutants who sing praises to the &quot;almighty bomb&quot;. There's this black dude who can make people kill each other if he shuts his eyes real tight and looks like he's taking a crap.I am not making any of this up.What saves the film at this point is a cameo by none other than Moses himself. The NRA chairman appears towards the end of the movie and he's as surly as ever. His manic performance takes &quot;Beneath&quot; up a notch.But to say the ending is anti-climatic is, well, an understatement.There seems to be no hurry to get the &quot;Planet of the Ape&quot; sequels out on DVD.

1380818,"Darren Aronofsky certainly knows how to make dark psychological dramas: ""The Wrestler"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" were both gritty, disturbing films that seemed almost like documentaries. Aronofsky typically gets stellar performances from his Actors and ""Black Swan"" is no exception. Natalie Portman's performance as the fragile ballerina who descends into madness is wonderfully dark. Winona Ryder's brief role as an aging, broken ballerina is outstanding as well. But the film founders about half way through and suddenly becomes twisted, dizzying, and hard to follow.

1287207,"This flick is extremely imaginative, although I feel obligated to note that its basic theme has a fair amount in common with ""Alien Nation."" The film is done mostly in documentary form. A huge alien spacecraft comes to rest over Johannesburg, South Africa. Eventually humans board the ship and find about 1 million destitute and starving aliens. Due to their crustacean-looking appearance, they are derogatorily nicknamed ""prawns."" The film revolves around a scenario in which the South African government seeks to relocate the ""prawns"" to a reservation in the South African hinterlands, away from the big city.There is not much in the way of characterization in this film.  Part of this is because the aliens themselves are essentially portrayed mostly as ignorant slum-dwellers who mainly only speak their own language. The poor treatment meted out to the aliens is, unfortunately, all too plausible and this is the real point of this film.This one is worth a try for science fiction aficionados and given its limited budget and lack of big-star cast, it is impressive in its own way. RJB.",N/A
187258,"I support local filmmaking.  I support the independent artist that wants to express himself/herself in the cinematic way.  What I enjoy with the independent artist is their way of expressing the already known.  For example, one of my favorite films is the independent sci-fi time travel piece called ""Primer"", you may or may not have heard of it.  The reason that I enjoy it so much is because it takes an old idea (that of time travel) and redefines it.  It recreates the wheel that Hollywood seems to cannot seem to do without CGI and actors with too much money.  It was exciting then to get Larry Fessenden's original student film ""Habit"" except with a bigger budget and after being immersed in the game a bit longer.  Fessenden's newer version of ""Habit"" gives us more gore, more scenery, and more ... well ... nudity than originally envisioned.  He takes the typical ""vampire"" wheel (a story that we have seen in countless films) and recreates - giving us a modern day horror that is built upon both mythological lore as well as personal demons.  During the course of 112 minutes, a great story is unfolded before our eyes - alas, it isn't the most powerful of stories, nor is it the most well-acted of stories, but it has something most Hollywood big-budget films seem to lack today , that is heart and substance.Fessenden, who not only does work behind the camera, but also as the main character named Sam, gives us a glimpse of New York city circa 1990.  Times seem to be tough, Sam works nights as a bartender and has found (after the death of his dad), that drinking dulls most of the pains.  One of our first introductions with Sam is at a party, where he arrives drunk and continues to drink throughout the course of the evening.  It is during this party that we meet the somewhat sensual Anna, who immediately locks target with Sam.  She entrances him similar to what Dracula did to Miss Mina, but in an eerie role reversal.  They continue their gathering outside, but in Sam's drunken stupor, he misses the opportunity to connect with Anna.  Not to worry vampire lovers, they reconnect after Anna supposedly snacks on one of Sam's friends - and the two begin a very physical courtship.  Oddly, Anna only appears at night, away from friends, and will not tell Sam anything about her.  She bits his lip, he thins its foreplay.  It dramatically changes when Sam seems to get sick over time, forgetting the simplest of tasks, and eventually driving himself mad with scenarios of what Anna may be doing to him.  Of coarse, nobody believes him, so not only does he battle with Anna's vying but also with his friends who seem to believe he is slowly going mad, which becomes the eventual focus to this film.  We are left with this surprising question in our minds as Fessenden ends with anything but your moment of zen.I would like to begin by saying that I thought this was an extremely strong outing for a low-budget director.  I wasn't hoping for Troma level, and I didn't get it.  I wasn't hoping for another repeat of ""Def By Temptation"", and thankfully it never showed.  What I witnessed with this film was an innovated director reinventing an old genre.  Hollywood continues every year to do this type of story, but their moments seem stale and recycled more than innovative and classic.  Fessenden uses his mind and truly makes a terrifying film that questions the basics of the vampire genre and relates them to modern cinema.  It is almost like a horror version of ""Fight Club"" except not as strong.  He uses violence, nudity, and realism to bring this fictional story into the light of New York City taking us to places that are familiar and at most, extremely spooky.  This is not a bad film, but I cannot boast that it is perfect.  It is continually flawed, forcing your to focus on the story because at times the acting is laughable at best and his ""A to B to C"" logic seems too overloaded and detailed.  The acting, outside of the verbal slandering of Aaron Beall's Nick, was just poor.  This could have been tightened up a bit to create stronger scenes between the characters.  I thought Sam was ""acting"" like he was drunk more than he was, the moments of intimacy seemed to be wanted instead of needed, and as we get closer to the end, the moments between Nick and Rae seem distant and lost.  Strength in the words would have tightened up this loose end.Secondly, I had trouble with parts of the story.  I don't want to disregard what Fessenden has done here because I think it is a strong moment in cinematic glory, but just small ends that needed to be less loose.  He started so strong with ""Habit"" that he couldn't keep the momentum flowing until the end.  One of my favorite scenes in the film is when he walks by a artist doing nude photos at night - a moment that seems similar to the movie that we are watching, but I loose it when he goes to Rae's grandmother's house and the Thanksgiving dinner there.  Fessenden also seems a bit loose on the entire ""loosing his father"" moments that seem to peak in and out of existence throughout the film.  I think that it helps us understand Sam's moments of insanity - especially near the end - but we needed more spent towards his father than at the ocean with friends.  There just seemed to be an unbalance in the force.  There are my only two complaints about the film (outside the fact I wished there was a director commentary), because I think Fessenden can do a decent job - just don't go off focus.Overall, I would suggest this film to only a select number of friends - those that appreciate the cinematic art.  I say this because to the unwilling eye, this will look like a cheap ""B"" horror film that teeters on nothing, but I saw so much more than that.  I saw a skilled director revisiting his old work to bring back into the public eye.  This is a great film about vampires, or at least the idea of vampires - but it is not for everyone.  It leaves the story open-ended, giving us a chance to make decisions for ourselves and that, in itself, is what creates the true horror.Oh, what about that goofy video that didn't seem to fit with the film - I guess I could do without that again, but I digress...Grade: *** out of *****",N/A

After he is taken into custody, Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) liberate him.  Blade discovers that two of them belong to The Nightstalkers, a group of vampire hunters secretly trained by Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson).  Teaming up with his new allies, Blade must combat a new threat - the recently -resurrected Drake (Dominic Purcell).""Blade: Trinity"" is burdened by one major flaw - there is not enough Blade in it.  The inclusion of The Nightstalkers is a blatant attempt to set them up for a spin-off and they take away precious screen time that should have been devoted to the main character.  Making matters worse is the fact that the new vampire hunters are rather forgettable.  Reynolds' one-liners quickly become groan-inducing and Biel does not have much screen presence to speak of.  Posey fares much better in her role.  It is clear that she is having a great deal of fun and she actually manages to come across as more memorable than Purcell's Drake.  Yet, despite its problems, ""Blade: Trinity"" manages to hold together thanks to Snipes.  He once again projects that no-nonsense, loner quality that has made Blade so appealing.  Although the film does not give Snipes much to do, we still find ourselves cheering for him.  ""Blade: Trinity"" escapes the pit of mediocrity thanks to him.",N/A

810521,"A friend of mine and I saw a sneak preview of this last night, and I hate to report that it was, dare I say it, incredibly disappointing. There wasn't a plot twist you couldn't see coming a mile away. There wasn't a bit of romantic dialogue that wasn't contrived. (Renee Zellweger's character, the best thing in the film, makes fun of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's romantic patter at one point, when he mentions that each moment with her is a ""tiny diamond I carried with me."") And every Southern accent, save Zellweger's, was absolutely horrid.The film, adapted and directed by the occasionally great Anthony Minghella, is a misfire. A maudlin, melodramatic misfire.At the point where movie stars turn up in what are essentially cameo appearances, I felt like the film was sorta cheating to try and keep us interested. Jude Law's character Inman encounters them on his travels, and, I swear to God, it felt like Dorothy encountering a new character on the Yellow Brick Road in THE WIZARD OF OZ. Someone new shows up, shows off and disappears. Look, there's Natalie Portman as a war widow! Look, there's Jena Malone as the ferry girl! Look, there's Philip Seymour Hoffman as a minister!Thus, half of Jude Law's performance is spent being the savior or straight man to a bunch of guest stars. The movie treats him like he's the only story element needed to introduce us to a series of unrelated vignettes.Though my friend had a real problem with Nicole Kidman's accent attempt in the movie, I must say that Kidman as Ada, when she wasn't spouting romantic cliches in voiceover or trapped in a truly ridiculous ending and epilogue, kept my interest. Her relationship with Ruby Tewes, Zellweger's character, is the most interesting in the movie. The film's at its strongest when the two are working together to keep her family farm alive.Unfortunately, they're also coping with town villains who show up on occasion to remind us that they're inhuman evil and completely corrupt. (The most evil one is, natch, an albino with blue eyes and long hair so that we'll know he's unique enough for us to blindly hate him.) They kill blindly without reason, whenever a scene requires them to do something hateful. Wouldn't it have been more interesting if they had been layered, human villains? The movie gives the villains basic motivations and then lets them run amok, showing up only when they're required to do acts of evil.The film shows signs of ambition. The actors are too talented to phone in their performances, yet their characters exhibit surprisingly little depth.And the romantic dialogue, all the yearning and hand-wringing, is straight out of a Harlequin novel. When you hear one of Nicole Kidman's voiceovers begin (and they start up the first one during the opening credits), prepare to count the cliches and eye-rolling statements.COLD MOUNTAIN is a historical romance in the vein of TITANIC, overwrought and badly written yet sure to be involving to those who like ""old-fashioned romance,"" no matter how badly done it is.

1691604,"&#8220;Vampire Academy&#8221; is based on Richelle Mead&#8217;s bestselling series. The film relates the legend of Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) and Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry), two 17-year-old girls who attend St. Vladamirs Academy, a hidden boarding school for Moroi (mortal, peaceful vampires) and Dhampirs (half-vampire/half-human guardians). Rose, a rebellious guardian-in-training, and her best friend, Lissa, a royal vampire princess, escape from the school but are captured and returned to the very place where they believe their lives may be in jeopardy.Thrust back into the perils of Moroi society and high school, Lissa struggles to reclaim her status while Rose trains with her mentor and love interest, Dimitri (Danila Kozlovsky), to guarantee her place as Lissa&#8217;s guardian. Rose will go to any extreme to protect Lissa from those within the Academy walls who intend to exploit her and from the Strigoi (immortal, evil vampires) who hunt her kind from outside its sanctuary.This is another picture based on young adult fiction that combines teenage angst, romance, and supernatural creatures. Since the &#8220;Twilight&#8221; series hit screens, the vampire of legend has been reduced from evil, nocturnal predator to pale-faced fashion-model types. &#8220;Vampire Academy&#8221; unimaginatively continues with that portrayal. The acting is mediocre at best and the entire film exudes a profound sense of deja vu.Special features on the Blu-ray release include alternate opening, deleted scenes, and a conversation with author Richelle Mead.",N/A

1352852,"The first two episodes of this season really almost did me in as a fan. It was so obvious that the show didn't know where to go. This is something that has cropped up here and there , in all of the earlier seasons , except perhaps the first. A good example would be the sudden, unlikely death of U-Turn. In fact, in my opinion, the writing on this show has ALWAYS been a little on the uneven side. The most popular three solutions to problems as they come bearing down on Nancy....the DEA, Nancy f's someone or someone dies...or sometimes all three, as in the case of Peter.I stuck with it this particular season and at times I thought "" cool , they're back, this is going to be great"".  Unfortuneatly, it never really delivered anything solid or even very memorable other than maybe the conclusion.I thought the show was very stale towards the end of the 5th season , again , other than the finale. Going on the run gave the show a real chance to settle, well , anywhere , really. My imagination soared at the concept of the clan somewhere a little different, such as Canada or Seattle. A chance to recapture some of that magic of the first two seasons without the repetitive, overbearing seriousness of her ascent through the higher ranks. Face it, Nancy was at her best when she was still a small fish.I couldn't help but feel that the writers did not have an end game for the 6th season and didn't really expect a 7th season. It seemed everytime they ran out of quick laugh type scenarios...they moved them down the road. Finally, another option other than death, the DEA and/or sex...just move on. I really wonder if this is an option we may need to consider as fans, in order to preserve the memory of a once overwhelmingly fantastic, unique and innovative show.I am starting to look at this show as Weeds : season 1-3, and Weeds Lite: Season 4&5 and now Sorta-Like-Weeds: now with less of a plot and fewer laughs BUT at least the scenary changes",N/A

1012809,"Season 5 of Andromeda is better than season 4. A lot better. But unfortunately that isn't really saying very much. The final season of this show saw a return to a slightly more goal-oriented, arc-based storytelling, and that is definitely in its favor.The trouble is that the goal is too vague and too pointless. The show started out back in season 1 with the goal of restoring the Commonwealth. The goal in season 5? Repair the ship and get out of a claustrophobic star system. Whenever you go from something so grandiose to something so basic, there's practically no way to keep it from being a disappointment.While there were a few decent moments in the season, such as the return of Hohne and the corridor scene with Harper in the last episode, they are few and far between. And, more importantly, they can't compete with such ridiculous horrors as making Drago Museveni - the father of all Nietzcheans - into an annoying punk, rather than the warrior that the images of his remains would have you believe he was (remains which they actually show in that episode, by the way). The season tries to have more good moments than it actually does, but many of them fall flat, such as the whole thing with Beka's ""father"". The rest of the time, one of the main cast punches somebody for looking at them the wrong way, because that is clearly the best way to solve all problems, including diplomatic ones. Add on top of all this the conspicuous absence of Lexa Doig (Andromeda herself) for much of the season.Dylan Hunt was never the most interesting character on the show (that honor would go to either Tyr Anasazi or Rev Bem), but when the show first started out he was not the larger-than-life character that he eventually became. In season 1, and somewhat in season 2, Dylan was wrong sometimes. He sometimes made morally questionable decisions in pursuit of his goals. What made him likable was that he was always trying to do the right thing, even when he went about it in questionable ways.Over the years, his character transformed into an over-the-top hero. Always right. Always good. There was no questioning his decisions, because he was the Super Awesome Captain. It really did become Hercules In Space, except less fun. Despite some attempts in season 5 to add more interesting facets to his character (making him into an evolved Vedran, for example), he retained the one trait that made the character completely uninteresting: infallibility.Season 5 could have been worse. It could have been another season 4. But the fact of the matter is that it simply wasn't enough to redeem what started out as an imperfect but promising show. More than anything, season 5 left me with a feeling of ""who cares?""The final episode brought the show back to its Commonwealth/anti-Abyss focus, but it had been absent for so long, and things had been left in such a state of disarray without resolution, that it just didn't cut it. There were too many abandoned threads in the Commonwealth storyline, which adds up to nothing but too little reason to be interested.Consider: despite a season 2 episode indicating that the Vedrans were still around and very much aware of Hunt's mission to restore the Commonwealth, when the Vedran homeworld is finally reunited with the rest of the known worlds, you don't see any Vedrans. Aside from the fact that the people in that system can now travel to other places, there's nothing to indicate that the reunion even matters in the grand scheme of things.",N/A

915387,"Several months after the horrifying events of the original film, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) takes her creepy son, Aidan (the still charmless David Dorfman) and relocates to a small town far from the city. Soon after her arrival, a teen is found murdered so Rachel decides to do some investigating. She discovers that Samara is alive and well (no pun intended) and up to her old tricks. Unable to escape her evil influence, Rachel must do some more detective work or else her son, who begins to show signs of possession may pay the ultimate price.Inferior sequel to the original horror hit is still an enjoyable watch. Thanks largely to the creative visual effects. This installment relies less on suspense and more on cheap thrills but if you let yourself get taken in by the awesome images on display, you may easily forget that the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The film's possession theme is an interesting one but it's very sloppily done. The director took a great idea and did absolutely nothing with it. Which is a shame because there are layers to this story that could have been expanded on or executed better. It appears the director was too busy trying to make this picture look good therefore neglecting the plot. But as I mentioned previously, if this film works, it's because it's visually spellbinding. In one incident, during Aidan's bath, we see water pour upwards out of the bathtub and drip from the bathroom ceiling. In another creepy scene, we see the murderous Samara scratch Aidan's bedroom wall which then grows into an over-sized, fiery stain. In another, we witness Samara, almost spider-like, climb and claw her way out of the well in pursuit of a frightened Rachel. Episodes such as these are reason enough to recommend this picture. Another good reason is the great cast. Naomi Watts is great as the distraught Rachel Keller, a mother who desperately tries to save her only child's soul. Other's in the cast include Elizabeth Perkins and an almost unrecognizable Sissy Spacek who is especially creepy as Samara's birth mother. With her messed up hair and sad, weathered face, Spacek delivers the most chilling line in the film ""You let the dead get in.""We can all agree that ""The Ring Two"" is inferior in almost every way to the original. However, the great cast, good performances and spine-chilling imagery should please many horror film fans. They should definitely give this film a try.Recommended.",N/A

The sound and music is equally full of hiss and pop, which greatly reduced how much I enjoyed the show.I was also disappointed that the cover art is touched up and painted, but the film is black and white only.

1207813,"Chronicling the life of English journalist George Hogg during WWII, ""The Children of Huang Shi"" attempts to show the atrocities faced by the Chinese people during the Japanese occupation of the country in the early stages of the war.Hogg (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an ambitious (albeit naive), young journalist trying to get to Nanjing. Under the guise of a Red Cross worker, he gains entrance, but quickly finds out this assignment will test all of his survival skills. His journalist peer (David Wenham) is killed, Hogg is stranded in Nanjing with an extremely aggressive (and murderous) force of Japanese soldiers, and to top it off, he is captured with the evidence of the atrocious behavior of the Japanese (killing of innocent villagers-men, women and children).It is only the fortuitous presence of a Chinese Nationalist (played with tremendous credibility by Chow Yun-Fat) that Hogg eventually escapes, making his way to an orphanage, partially looked after by Lee Pearsons (played with a lack of credibility by Radha Mitchell-a fine actress, but not her brightest hour). Befriending the boys-scared, lonely, starving, and diseased-isn't Hogg's easiest task, but he manages to convey a strong sense of self in the children, aided by Merchant Wang's (Michelle Yeoh) advice and supplies.Upon learning of the Japanese army's advancement into the orphanage territory, and knowing the boys could be conscripted at any time, Hogg decides to make the dangerous, 700 mile trek through the famous `Silk Road' (of Marco Polo fame). This is where this epic film should have risen to the occasion, with grandeur and wide-angle scope, but there is a definite disconnection with the viewer of the hardship faced by Hogg, Lee, and the children. The time feels shortened and compressed during the most challenging portion of the film, and when Hogg succumbs to tetanus, one feels cheated.""The Children of Huang Shi"" had much potential, but fell a little flat overall. A 2.5 star effort, worth at least one viewing for a story many in the States are unaware of.",The Children of Huang Shi
653749,"When I heard that a ""Transformers"" film was in the works, I became excited.  ""Yes, yes, yes! This is gonna rule!""When I heard who was directing it. ""Oh.""I have yet to see a Michael Bay movie that wasn't exciting (except maybe Pearl Harbor). This guy knows how to blow the socks off of his audience in terms of action sequences, and Transformers certainly did that, without a doubt. It's fair to say that Michael Bay is one of the best action film directors there is. It's also fair to say that he one of the worst storytellers in Hollywood.He butchered the Transformers, at least as I remember them growing up, but that wasn't a letdown. I heard the director's name and I saw it coming. Therefore I am able to give this movie three stars. The story was ridiculous, but the kid in the main role did okay, and the chick was hot and the action was SICK!! And THAT'S why I pay to see Michael Bay's films. The plot just moves the ""story"" from A to B and finally to Z and is nothing special-- never is when Bay is involved. But I knew I'd love the action. He never fails me there. So, the movie only sucked a little.One purist complaint I have (and I can complain for hours about how this wasn't like the Transformers of my youth) isn't that Bumblebee was a Chevy Camaro instead of a VW Bug (we have VW to thank for that). That upset plenty of old-school fans of the toys and animated series. My biggest problem is that while the Autobots as characters were fleshed out about as well as Michael Bay knows how to flesh out characters in his films, the Decepticons had zero personality and not enough screen time in my opinion. They were just evil, cold, machines that had little to say to each other, and just went on a destructive rampage.C'mon man! Where's the rivalry between Megatron and Starscream? Where is all the wisecracking and taunting between them and the Autobots? Why don't we see as much of the Decepticons? They were equal parts in the series. That, to me, was the biggest disappointment, never mind the flimsy storytelling which I was prepared for going in.I won't say its better, but I highly recommend the 1986 Animated Transformers movie. As action goes it can't compete with Michael Bay, but it's classic Tranformers.I can go on, but there are other, better, longer reviews that do it for me, so I'll wrap this up and say that, yeah, it's a good movie, a bad story, but still a damn fine piece of action, and I will buy this on dvd. I'm still up in the air over whether I'll get it in HD or not. I wish they'd put this on a HD DVD Combo Disc like ""300"" did. I'm just not sure that this movie is worth the extra expense of buying it on HD, but for action fans this movie truly delivers action. It falls short in the story department, but that's Michael Bay for you.",Transformers
473933,"This mostly forgotten thriller starring Reese Witherspoon (Lissa) and Alessandro Nivola (Nick) suffers from a mightily contrived plot and a ""Huh?--What happened?"" ending.

Let's just say that the viewer does not find out about this plot until the end, and then it seems a little...well, lame.Along comes Lissa looking mighty fine and they fall in love, although I must say the chemistry certainly didn't spark up the screen.  Now comes complication number one: the old man blew almost all his money and what he didn't blow the IRS is grabbing.  Because of this Nick gets tempted into driving a get-away car for a drug rip off...  Things go awry and Nick ends up in deep doo-doo, and in desperation gets Lissa to help him rip off an old school chum...which...  Well, what these people do in desperation is a little on the unbelievable side.I'm sorry that's all vague, but at least it's enough information to let you know if you actually saw this movie or not.  Now, if you like probability-challenged, convoluted plots with loose ends and a lot of unlikely twists and turns, you might find this movie interesting.  And if you like Reese, and you should, you might also find a reason for sticking around until the end.  I know I did.  She does a good job and looks good doing it.Bottom line: although the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, it can also be said that the most meticulously contrived plots sometimes turn out about as convincing as pseudoscience.

550886,"when it comes to rock (maybe even music in general), the quintessence of overrated is one Elvis Presley. the man's claim to the title ""King Of Rock & Roll"" is dubious at best for two reasons...the first is that he was reasonably talented but HARDLY a genius. he only tried to write songs, to CREATE rather than simply RELAY music, once or twice. usually, he didn't even bother to participate in the selecting the next single release. and of course he was anything BUT an innovator. his act was modeled as exactly as possible on those of a thousand black artists who weren't about to get anything close to the same level of exposure, what with being black. indeed, Elvis' '50s heyday was marked by a uniquely shameless musical racism: numerous songs, including such anthems as ""Sh-Boom"" and ""Shake Rattle & Roll,"" were marginal semi-hits for the black artists who created them, then major nationwide smashes for the white artists who liberally appropriated them. and that's what Elvis' career was built on, really: the experiment had reached the point where a commodity could be made not of merely a song, but of a singer.(i grant you none of this was common knowledge at the time, but what about today, decades after the cat escaped the bag? you'd think that if there's one thing that should spell certain doom for Elvis worship - not necessarily Elvis fondness or appreciation, but certainly Elvis WORSHIP - it's the effective death of the misapprehention that he was an original. so why didn't it? God alone knows, and He's not talkin'.)the other strike against him is a simple question of timing. Muddy Waters sangs that the blues got pregenant, and they called the baby Rock & Roll. well, the '50s was the gestation period, and certain elements would need more time to crystalize. this scrappy little lovechild of blues and country will find it's own identity and establish it's own purpose - come of age, if you will - in the '60s. to declare King Of Rock & Roll someone who preceeds The Beatles and The Stones is like declaring King Of Literature some Neanderthal scribbling on his cave wall. or King Of Medicine whoever came up with releasing ""demons"" by drilling holes in the skull.but for all that, music was indeed Elvis' niche. (i repeat, i take exception not to his existing or having a career, but his being misrepresented as a pinnacle. you have to do more than simply sing whatever random song you get handed to qualify there.) his music may be unexceptional, but it wasn't terrible, and he was talented enough to get some fun out of it.the notorious train wreck that is his movie career is another matter entirely. your serious movie critics tend to have about as much affection for Elvis as they have toward Charles Manson, and even the most fanatic Elvis zealots have been known to grudgingly admit that there's a reason for that. even Elvis himself is said to of had only so much tolerance for the sort of assembly-line fluff-pieces he tended to end up in.this is what makes JAILHOUSE ROCK a semi-landmark. (it may be no CITIZEN KANE, but since the Elvis machine never set the bar that high, that's a moot point.) Elvis was one of those ""actors"" who was best suited to basically playing himself, and this film enables him to do so without drowning him in the usual Vegas-style schmaltz. not that there aren't still a few loose ends. in the beginning, for instance, when he goes to court for murder, he could plead self-defense. the only reason he doesn't is because there's no further story if he does. but all in all this tale of an angry young man's attempts to break into the business suits Elvis and his meager acting chops, to say nothing of the fact that the title track is his single best song.the fact still stand, though, that Elvis was the King Of Rock & Roll like Charles Manson was the King Of Law & Order. incredibly, some have actually asked, in complete earnestness, what would've become of Rock & Roll without Elvis. given that Elvis was a cypher and a puppet, the answer is, precisely what did become of Rock & roll. it's a fact: in a world without an Elvis, Colonel Parker would've just found some other stooge.rock & roll without THE BEATLES, now THAT would've been a catastrophe of Vesuvius proportions!!",N/A
392109,"The Innocents (Jack Clayton, 1961)Jack Clayton didn't direct many films over the course of his life, but it seems as if every one of them has developed at least a cult following over the years. The Innocents is one that continues to keep its director's name alive. Based on Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw,"" The Innocents is the story of Miss Giddens (the mighty Deborah Kerr), who takes a position as a governess to Miles (Village of the Damned's Martin Stephens) and Flora (Pamela Franklin, who went on to be a familiar TV actress, guest starring in a number of shows) after the death of their previous governess. The childrens' behavior gets somewhat odd, and Miss Giddens, with the help of her only real friend, Mrs. Grose (Oliver!'s Megs Jenkins), must determine whether the children are simply being malicious, or whether supernatural elements are afoot.This is good stuff, a mystery/horror film that relies mostly on atmosphere to get its point across. There are some times when it crosses the line into cheesiness-- the ""eerie"" reflection of a ghost's face in the window, for example-- but there's been far, far worse in the ensuing forty-five years.

The most important aspect of Star Trek types movies is the building up of the story, the natural progression to the scenes with smooth transitions.

He is one of the survivors who makes his way back to the hospital, which is being swamped with the injured and the sick.The scenes of the holocaust are quite spectacular (for their time) and this is the highlight of the film.

If nuclear war really happened, it's highly unlikely that a hospital would be able to help anyone. (That was put across quite graphically in ""Threads"".) Is a car really a safe place to hide from a nuclear explosion? If my memory serves me correctly, Jason Robards wasn't even scratched!

481955,"I was a little disappointed with this movie, but I suspect my expectations were set too high based on some glowing reviews that led me to buy it.  However, it's the kind of movie I think I'll appreciate more on repeat viewings (it is very long, there are many characters to keep track of - often in different costume, making it hard to remember who's who - and many subtleties to pick up on).  It bore resemblance to other movies about musical genius (Amadeus, especially in the opening and conducting scenes; Immortal Beloved and Copying Beethoven - all great movies to emulate, by the way).The movie felt a bit choppy, and I watched many scenes wondering what they contributed to the story and why they were included.  It's almost as if someone thought ""let's include this!  Oh, and let's include that!,"" but then these disparate vignettes weren't stitched together very well to make them flow better, and the result was an overly long movie that leaves you with many questions.  There seemed to be too much unnecessary detail at times, yet not enough at others.  Basically, the movie could have benefited from better editing, both for length and content.  To give one glaring example, Sullivan was adamant in refusing to write any more music for comic operas and steadfast in his desire to write serious ones.  This stumbling block between the two geniuses was noted over and over.  Yet, Sullivan seems to miraculously come around and embrace The Mikado, giving up on his serious objections to the genre.  By what process did that transformation happen when he was so stubborn earlier?  This is central to the story and yet is not really explained aside from one scene where Sullivan apparently likes the new libretto (but why when it's not much different from the others???).Having done all that nitpicking, I must say this film has many pluses - not the least of which is the beautifully rendered music, the extended live performance numbers, the great singing (which some have complained about but I found it marvelous and highly recommend the soundtrack), the opulent costumes, magnificent sets and excellent cast.  Visually it reminds me a bit of Moulin Rouge in its overall lushness.  The period setting is also of great interest (has anyone ever explored the pitfalls of the just-invented telephone before, or the marvel of the ""reservoir pen"" with its own ink?)Perhaps there is just too much going on in this movie to adequately absorb in one setting.  Therefore, I am watching it again - which, come to think of it, is pretty high praise for any movie.  So ultimately, I must recommend.  Eventually, you'll probably love it.",Topsy Turvy VHS

984189,"Maybe if I hadn't gorged myself on Hong Kong movies in the 90s my standards wouldn't be so high, but this movie has the look and feel of a dozen better movies (including the crossover movies of Zhang Yimou and Ang Lee) and it suffers too much from the comparisons. It's got the discipline of the Zhang Yimou movies and the dopiness of the 90s HK movies. Watching this movie, I felt like the director shot the screenplay as is without rewrites and managed to use a lot of the better sets with production values.What I didn't get was an ounce of passion. The reasons why the girl is in love with the slave (whom she thinks is the general in one of those Cyrano de Bergerac twists) are stupid. The curse/promise is obviously made to be broken and the villain is the only thing this movie has going for him (feather boas rule!)Beyond that it's a mishmosh of martial arts sequences filmed many times over and storylines cribbed from The Young & the Restless. I find myself amazed that cheesier/clumsier/cheaper movies like Green Snake and Bride with White Hair surpass this movie. But they had emotion and passion (not to mention Tsui Hark and Ronnie Yu) and this one just has pretty sets (but not as pretty as Zhang Yimou's sets so even here the movie fails)See it as a bargain movie maybe, but don't pay full price.",N/A

Like most sequels it suffers from &quot;overkill.&quot;  Having two villains (the returning &quot;Imhotep&quot; and the new &quot;Scorpion King, too many inept marksmen, and a horde of computer-generated &quot;warriors&quot; makes this film too much to bear.

Lo Lieh plays the master of disguise and we don't find out until the end exactly what is going on between Lieh and Gordon.The main problem is that this movie is boring and doesn't have many fights.  I don't mind a kung fu movie that only has a few fights as long as it is a good story.  The story is not very good in this movie and it just mainly involves bad comedy.  The only part I laughed at is when Lau Wing and Lee Hoi San have to fight a bunch of lepers.  It was one of those moments that is funny only because it is so incrediby stupid.  While the action is sparse, it is very good when it comes.  There are only 3 real fights and they are all VERY good.  The 2nd one is a silent fight where the 2 can't make any noise so that they don't alert the guards outside.  The final fight is very good with a 3 section metal staff against a sword but they lose the weapons pretty quick and go hand to hand.  The first fight is actually the best, the silent one is second, and the finale is third.  All in all, a very average movie that could have been much better with a few more fights.

1190190,"I really, really wished someone else would have written this movie. There were a lot of things wrong with Terminator Salvation, but this is coming from a person who has watched the prior three installments and the television series. To the average young movie watcher who doesn't know the entire cast of characters in John Connor's story, this film will come off as a mediocre sci-fi action thriller with a confusingly weak story.Taking place after a Nuclear blast has wiped out much of the human race, John Connor (now a grizzled war vet) is one of the leaders of a revolutionary underground movement hell bent on taking back the earth from their machine masters. In the first two Terminator movies we are given a bit of history on this John Connor, how he loved people, how his selflessness and bravado was enough to make them forget their fears and fight back against the zerg. What I saw in Christian Bale's version of John Connor was a hardened loner-type, showing little to no emotion aside from the few times he was with his pregnant wife. This version did not feel like the leader we were made to believe led the revolution, he just lacked the sort of charisma that you would expect a guy like that to hold. He did not go through the ranks touching men on their shoulders and giving the fighters that reassuring eye to let them know he has their back... the tiny hints that a viewer looks for to confirm their belief that this man was their saviour, just weren't there. No, John seemed cold, too cold, his decisions were not democratic, his beliefs are dashed aside at a whim and he seems to have no recollection of his youth (Terminaor 2: Judgement Day) when a machine taught him to think and not allow blind hate to cloud his judgement. This John Connor has a deep hate for the machines and it is reinforced by an ancient tape recorder that plays his mother's instructions from the past. This wrong John Connor ruined it movie for me because he is the protagonist, yet his story, visage, and history are so wrong that it was hard to look past him and like the movie.The story of Terminator Salvation felt like the piecing together of three different scripts being that it started out very well and ended up going nowhere fast. In the past movies we were led to believe that Skynet was so advanced and powerful, the only way out for the human race was to send someone back in the past to stop it from even starting. The Skynet we see in this movie is advanced... at building cool machines and motorcycles (that lack any real AI). To recall Arnold's T-800 relentlessly doing detective work and searching for Sarah Connor in the first Terminator to seeing the T-600s in this movie (the obvious future of it all) walking blindly and being outsmarted by children, just didn't make sense whatsoever. Hell the explosions were pretty but I had absolutely no fear of the machine menace that ruled the world. This is not how I felt in the older movies. Remember how hopeless it seemed when the T-1000 chased the Connor family in T2, how it seemed nothing could stop it? It made you say to yourself, ""damn! How would you deal with 10 of those things if you can't even handle one in this movie!?"" Well somehow McG and crew forgot this tiny element because the dumb machines and clueless T-600 models are laughably bad at tracking anything.Through all the horrible and forgettable writing that plagued this letdown, the best parts were the scenes with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Not so much the chemistry, but the fact that they had the least annoying scenes in the entire thing. The action scenes which had Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and John Connor (Christian Bale) seemed to be full of the most unrealistic coincidences to fall in their favor. The story behind Marcus Wright was probably the most interesting and would have benefited the movie if they delved into his past a bit more. The conflict in screen time between him and Connor did not flow well and it would have been better if they stayed with him and ditched Connor altogether.In closing I will say that Terminator Salvation was pretty but lacking in substance, relevance and ultimately reason. There is nothing to be learned from this one and it neither wraps up the saga nor adds anything to it. The story was a huge waste of time and a disappointment. Moon Bloodgood was deliciously hot though... I will give it that... but only that.",N/A
758565,"I had a bit of trouble with my rating because there are several issues I can see using the term ""for beginners"" with this DVD.....Beginners -- well to Pilates? Stability ball? Exercise in general? Depending on what you pick I would give a different answer.Pilates -- I would say Yes  - I own maybe one other Pilates and do not use it, so at least this caught my attention enough not to give it away. I felt the instructions were clear, demonstrated well and easy to follow. I would say a beginner could follow this.Stability ball -- sitting on the fence on this one. I got this because I just don't have many DVD's for the ball and wanted to expand the use of the equipment. That said she is OK on the basic instructions. I think someone who has never used the stability ball could be unstable and would tend to give up.Exercise in general -- No I would not say beginner  - I could see trying to stabilize on the ball and follow the Pilates moves would send the user to the floor more than once.I think this is a nice workout with great moves for toning, flexibility, and breathing techniques.

172452,"I found BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a painfully sad experience--wonderfully filmed, as Ang Lee's movies usually are, and well acted, but deeply depressing. It was comparable to watching a slow-motion train wreck on an ironically beautiful, bright sunny day--or reading one of Thomas Hardy's later novels.Neither Ennis Del Mar nor Jack Twist (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) was a character that most of us would admire or respect: both were like good-looking Lost Boys who never became responsible adults with the passage of time. Despite their differences in temperaments and experiences, they were like a pair of perpetual Peter Pans, poorly educated, pitifully below average intelligence, and morally irresponsible.Most would agree that our DNA and the vissitudes of life largely determine what handicaps or deficiencies our minds and bodies have, and these normally are factors that nobody ought to be blamed for. But our willpower (or ""won't-power""), especially when it involves honest interactions with others, is usually seen as an entirely different matter. Throughout the film, both Ennis and Jack lead dishonest lives that harm their spouses, their children, themselves, and each other. (BTW, if you think this is harsh, ask yourself how vigorously you would defend a so-called straight married person who is leading a lie-based double life with one or more lovers outside his/her marriage.)If Ennis and Jack had been presented as malicious men, they would not deserve our pity. Instead, they come across as pitifully weak, essentially careless and thoughtless ageing adolescents. We watch their deceitful, destructive behavior with sorrow, knowing that they are incapable of changing for the better--perhaps foolishly hoping their lives will improve somehow but expecting them to worsen.As far as courage and integrity are concerned, the one bright spot in the picture was when Jack Twist stood up to his domineering father-in-law (ably played by L. D. Newsome); sad to say, immediately he fell back into spinelessness and deceit. And the low point for Ennis was when he became violent with his ex-wife when she revealed that she knew he and Jack did not do any fishing on their fishing trips. Perhaps the most poignant scene is when Ennis asks his daughter, Alma Jr. (Kate Mara), if the man she's engaged to marry is in love with her, and she says that he is.The murder of Jack was skillfully foreshadowed and resonates, of course, with events that occur in many U.S. communities today. Sadly coping with this misfortune, Ennis, in the process of trying to fulfill Jack's wish that his ashes be taken to Brokeback Mountain, learns that his lover had been cheating on him with another man. At the end of the film, we can feel certain that he will never find happiness of any sort in the remainder of his own life.Early in his book WALDEN (1854), Thoreau comments, ""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats."" The film BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN almost seems designed to illustrate that grim view of humanity.",N/A

Everyone by now knows the results, so I don't need to worry about spoiling anything.After a 3 hour pyrotechnic sequence, and an emotional rendition of 'Billy-Jean' sung by the ghost of Roy Orbison, the event finally opened with a segment by Orlando Jordan, telling his loyal fans that if - no, WHEN he wins the rumble, he will make it his personal business to wipe out fourth-world debt. He was attacked by Howard Finkel with a plastic hairbrush, and was left bleeding.Jesse James, Rikishi Fatu, Rey Mysterio, Jerry Lawler, Mick Foley (all three personas) and Terry Funk defeated the Legion Of Doom in a 'Loser Must Die' elimination tag team match, when Rey Mysterio pinned Road Warrior Hawk for the decisive fall. As a result, Animal and Hawk were subsequently gunned down and killed by their own children.Shane McMahon defeated Stephanie McMahon in a street fight, with Vince McMahon as the special guest referee, after a diving 'hell-bow' drop from a 150 storey building in a different city.Afterwards, the two shook hands and hugged. However, Vince was so upset by Stephanie's performance, he ordered her to strip down to her underwear to everyone could point and laugh at her. Stephanie obliged, but no sooner had she done so, she revealed a secret pocket in her knickers, inside of which was a steel chair, which she used to render her father unconscious. He has been in a coma ever since.Triple H won a match he wasn't even fighting to win the World Heavyweight Title for the 7th time in 3 days. This was his 48th World title reign in total. After the match, the man he defeated for the title, Cowboy Bob Orton, said he was down-hearted by the loss, but informed his fans he would keep going, hopefully eventually marrying a member of the McMahon family so he can have the same, unjustified success that Triple H has been having. (UPDATE: With hindsight on my side, I must apologise for calling Triple H's success 'unjustified'. I feel that's somewhat too simple, as he is clearly talented and someone WWE cannot do without in their main-event scene. However, I still feel he's over-egged it somewhat in the past and his on-paper legacy is probably going to be a bit too decorated.)Shawn Michaels and Diesel defeated the referee in a 'Squeeze My Spot' match for the ABC Amateur Boxing Heavyweight Title, after a double-team Eye Rake. As a result, the referee (aptly played by Tim Robbins of 'Shawshank Redemption' fame) needed 750,000 stitches in his brain.Undertaker defeated Yokozuna in an Inferno Match. Although Yokozuna was never set on fire, Kane suddenly arrived 7 years and 9 months earlier than he was supposed to, to recite poetry in honour of Jimi Hendrix. Yokozuna fainted in a pool of tears, and the Undertaker forged his signature onto a contract that said the Undertaker could win via 'standing up'. The contract also read that Yokozuna had to dress up like a dolphin for all future matches, which was the spawning of a comedic lineage that will never be out-done.In the 300 man Royal Rumble match, which lasted over 15 hours, the first two entrants, Orlando Jordan and Howard Finkel, were the last two in the ring. They both eliminated each other simultateously, and as a result nobody won the Rumble, inevitably renderring this video completely pointless.This, we know, but words cannot do justice to this video, so just buy it.*******UPDATE: Sorry for this rubbish review. I won't delete it, as I still find it very funny in places, but it's obviously not particularly relevant. I write this two and a half years after the original piece (3rd of January 2008). In reality, there wasn't THAT much to celebrate here anyway, except the incredible mark-out moment of Hogan and Warrior facing off near the end.*******",WWF: Royal Rumble 1990 VHS
202573,"Psycho II is a good follow-up to the Hitchock classic. It's not a masterpiece by any means, like its 1960 predecessor, but it does a decent job of re-introducing audiences to Norman Bates for a bloodier, more violent film that delivers decent suspense. A terrific cast, which includes pre-fame Dennis Franz (NYPD Blue) and the wonderful Meg Tilly, as well as the return of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Vera Miles as Lila, add to the fun. Wish Janet Leigh had somehow made a cameo.This is the plot in a nutshell: Norman Bates has been locked away in a mental institution for over 20 years, but is finally released. Lila Loomis, Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) sister, protests his release, but her arguments fall on deaf ears. Now Bates is back in town and trying to do right by working in a small diner. Soon he starts to see his long-deceased mother in the Bates Motel window and brutal murders start once again. Could it be Bates or is someone else feeding their deviant need to kill?Psycho II starts off with the famous shower scene from the original Psycho and holds interest. The film could have resorted to the cheap slasher techniques of the day, but instead it concentrates on developing the character of Norman Bates--a sympathetic soul who is fighting to overcome his past and live as a normal person. Norman is a victim of crazed people who insist on persecuting him and, as a result, seems incredibly sane by comparison. Unfortunately the end to Psycho II contradicts this development, turning Norman into a leering loon in preparation for another sequel.It would impossible for Psycho II to live up to the original, but the cast and crew give it their best shot. The film is actually pretty competent throughout, though the silly finale ruins what is otherwise an interesting and suspenseful (if totally unnecessary) sequel. Overall, this is a decent sequel with a great cast, and worth seeing for fans of the original, who may or may not like it. Either way, it's good to see and compare.",N/A

In the 2010 reimagining of Wes Craven's film A Nightmare on Elm Street, Jackie Earle Haley plays Freddy Krueger, and it is extremely different compared to the classic slasher film many viewers grew up watching. There is a different take on the make-up, as Kevin Yagher is not on the team for the remake. This movie is also dependent on computer technology, as it was used to ""remove"" parts of Freddy's cheek to make him look more like a ""real burn victim"" (although I, personally don't think either of the actors looked like real burn victims). The voice Jackie uses, although awesome and evil, doesn't belong in a remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street. His voice sounds great, and he's perfect for horror movies, but he really wasn't that great as Freddy Krueger.  I think Robert should have come back for a remake, or they should have stayed more faithful to the original movie, using the same character names (I think Nancy and Freddy are the only characters from the original movie that are in the remake).So, I say it's OKAY.

1044395,"THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING revolves around a young man named Doug (David de Vos) and the relationship that grows between himself and a man named Gene (Victor Lundin).  Doug is a pilot and the owner of a flight school. His school is doing well, but some delayed payments threaten to destroy his thriving business. He has been spending so much time at work that his wife Abby (Frances Black) feels neglected and spends most of her time eating junk food and watching soap operas.  A few weeks for Christmas, Doug receives a telephone call informing him that his biological father wants to contact him.  He agrees to meet the man whose real name is Eugene Holland. Gene was a former award-winning scientist who became a hermit after the death of his wife, Doug's birth mother. Gene has been spending the past thirty years working on a ""theory of everything"", a theory that unites all the mathematical and physical theories of the universe.  Gene is very close to succeeding, but he needs help. Unbeknownst to Doug, Gene is dying and his request for help is his attempt to finish his masterwork before he dies. The movie attempts to show how close Gene is to finishing his work by displaying Doug using Gene's mathematical and scientific theories to economics to win money from new financial supporters for his flight school. Gene misses his deceases wife dearly and feels that if he can decode the theory of everything, he will be able to open a doorway to heaven itself where he longs to see his wife.  Doug is a Christian who thinks that what Gene is missing is faith in Jesus and lovingly tells him so. In the meantime, Doug's half-sister threatens to ruin everything by having Gene committed for mental instability.Though it's not initially apparent, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a Christian movie. What that means is that a sermon (though not one in church) is contained in part of the movie and there is a ""come to Jesus"" moment where a character makes a declaration of faith. This isn't a bad thing, but viewers should be aware of it. Those moments are handled more believably in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING than they usually are in Christian movies. The ""sermon"" isn't very preachy and the character's conversion is one that actually seems natural.David de Vos does a good job as Doug. He also directed, wrote, and co-produced the movie. Victor Lundin gives the best performance in the movie. I enjoyed watching the scenes he was involved in the most.I understand the confines of low budget, independent filmmaking. However, even taking that into consideration there are some obvious flaws to THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. The story is actually fairly good, but the way the story is told isn't.  There are gaps in the movie that wouldn't have been so awkward with a little more explanation. For instance, Doug was an adopted child but the word ""adopted"" is never really mentioned, it's hinted at but never spoken. There are other parts of the movie that don't make much sense.  The biggest being the reappearance of Doug's half-sister. Towards the beginning of the movie she agrees to give up any responsibility or relationship she has with Gene. Then she suddenly reappears in a dramatic fashion towards the end of movie where her husband batters Doug's daughter in the presence of a couple of police officers. Conflict is essential for any good story, but it should be conflict that actually makes sense. In all honesty, her reappearance was unnecessary and the story would be smoother and more coherent without it.The other major flaw of THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING was the cinematography.  During most of the major conversations in the movie, some of the smaller ones, and many of the movie's key moments the camera revolves around the characters over and over and over. The technique is supposed to give the viewer a sense of omniscience, but it is overused in the movie and made me dizzy at times.Despite these flaws, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a movie that many will enjoy. It's a movie with a strong message that has no sex, foul language, and minimal violence so families will probably enjoy watching this together. It's also not as preachy as most Christian movies. With a decent script and good acting from the movie's leads, I wanted to really enjoy THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, but I only found it ho-hum. The gaps and nonsensical moments of the storytelling grated on me and I found the oft-used circular use of the camera to be annoying. Personally, I think the movie is a good effort, but one that doesn't meet its potential.",N/A

1343244,"I came at this unburdened by having read the book, so the movie stood on its own. I found far too many easy coincidences, such as the ridiculous number of preserved photo negatives from a 1966 parade in a nowhere town in Sweden that allow the disgraced journo and his punk g-friend to solve a 40-year-old murder. And the convenient stacks of 1960s Vander Co. business records, containing just the right clues, were another absurdity for me. I appreciated the hint at such a multi-layered mystery, but in the end I was not convinced by the reality. This could not have happened in real life, so I was not transported. It's also hard to see how someone could disappear to Australia and never be found until just the right moment. The leading man here is not much of an actor, either. He is semi-expressionless throughout, as is the girl of the title. Others find her performance great. I just thought it was one-dimensional. All the computer hocus-pocus seems unreal as well. not to mention the get-even finale which also depends on an absurd amount of written records all coming together thanks to the ""genius"" girl researcher. This is still entertaining, but deeply flawed.",N/A

Both Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman give award winning performances however the story itself moved slowly.

862000,"Having done all four workouts included on the dvd I can say that overall I'm happy that I added these to my collection.The first two workouts combine kickboxing and step moves. I'd never done this type of combination before and I found this combination to be really interesting and challenging.Even though I was ""all over the place"" trying to do some of the step moves I must admit it was actually fun (and would have probably been pretty entertaining to watch if someone saw me flailing away in my den:)).I wanted to mention that you don't actually need a step to do these workouts (and I don't currently own one) because there's one exerciser showing the moves without a step. I actually used my Yoga mat as a visual reference and stepped on that in place of a step. This worked well because it being my first time doing these workouts I'd probably have fallen off of a step :)The workouts themselves were very well designed overall but unfortunately they are marred by moments of REALLY stupid camera work! From time to time the camera people focus on a close up of an exerciser or scenery when a new move was being introduced. ""Stupid"" is the best way I can describe that and I can't even begin to imagine what they were thinking while they were filming! :)Still, it accounts for only a small percentage of the overall workouts. Certainly they were extremely frustrating moments but I just kept moving until I could ""catch up"" and this was more of an issue in the first two (kick box/step) rather than the last two (kickboxing only) workouts.In spite of the occasional camera foolishness, the workouts themselves are really great and creative!The kickboxing-only workouts, which are the 3rd and 4th programs on the dvd are well worth the low cost of the dvd even if you don't ever use the kick box/step programs. They are non-stop, fun, challenging and high energy.The design of the program was great in the way Shelley led you from the warm ups to the Kickbox type moves to cardio segments (and occasional squats on the Kickbox 1 segment as well). Of course being from a TV show there transitions between commercials aren't always seamless but it's not a big deal either.So I guess I'd say that if you are a fan of the Caribbean workout programs (which I have been for a while, I really love the three Pilates discs I have) then you'll probably enjoy this one as well! Just don't expect perfection in terms of the  camera work or transitions between commercials and you'll probably find they are really worthwhile in terms of the time spent doing them (only about 22 minutes) and certainly worth the cost.!",Kickboxing

872304,"9 Souls (Toshiyaki Toyoda, 2003)The premise of 9 Souls will sound familiar to many Americans over, roughly, twenty-five years old, as it's very close to the premise of Michael Keaton's 1991 comedy The Dream Team. The differences are that the escapees come from prison, rather than from a mental institution, and that, as the title would suggest, there are nine of them rather than four. The movie also wants to play this conceit as straight drama rather than screwball comedy, and in many ways that's its biggest failing. After all, there are many parts of this movie that border on the humorous, and had they slipped over the edge, it might have turned this mediocre offering into a really enjoyable film. It never gets there.Toyoda (Hanging Garden) takes nine prisoners who find themselves in the same cell, has them plot to escape, do so, and then try to get back to something resembling normality while evading the cops. ""Normal"" differs for each of them; one finds solace in visiting a stripper for whom he'd performed an organ transplant some years before. One wants to get back to his fianc&eacute;e. Another simply wants to find employment in a dumpling shop. There's a subplot about one of the prisoners, a counterfeiter, promising the group untold riches after he leads them to the ""key to the universe"", but while that seems to have been the original driving force of the movie, it takes a backseat to the lives of these characters.I'm not saying 9 Souls is a bad movie. I'm just not sure it knows what it wants to be. It doesn't help that every major comparison I can come up with for it (all Japanese road movies, for example, put me in mind of the immortal Kikujiro) is a comedy, and so I keep coming back to the idea that this could have been a lot more lighthearted than it was. It's obvious Toyoda saw the potential for this, and a lot of the more dramatic scenes in the movie seem as if they would have had more weight had they been surrounded by a bit more humor. (I also don't want to make it sound like the movie is entirely humorless; it isn't, but it definitely aspires to high drama.) It's a decent movie, but one which feels like it could have been so much more. ***",9 Souls

510135,"This certainly isn't one of Dario's classics, but the presence of Dario's daughter Asia in the central role, certainly raises the quality and interest of the film.  She is a solid actor and good fun to watch on screen.  Admittedly the plot is somewhat loose in parts, but this is typical of the Dario Argento style, and this movie certainly has the hallmarks of one of his films.  There is a fair degree of blood and guts but nothing too torturous to get worked up about.  I'd say it's about on par with most of his other efforts in this regard and perhaps a little less confronting.  As others have mentioned the quality of the film on this DVD is quite poor.  It looks very much like it was filmed on video rather than real film.  The colours are washed out and the image is grainy rather than sharp.  This is somewhat of an Achilles heel because Dario's movies draw much of their power from their vivid often somewhat surrealistic imagery.  When you are watching a diminished copy like this, you just don't notice the cinematography.  Hopefully, as others have said, a better copy is still to be released.",N/A

There was a decent buildup throughout the movie and then when you start to really get into it, the movie ends.I was really disappointed with this movie.

145528,"Though Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Kalidor in this movie rather than Conan, I always think of this movie as the third Conan movie.  Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman, who played Valeria in ""Conan the Barbarian"") takes an orb from a sort of temple of all women who plan to lock it away forever, coincidentally at the same time that Queen Gedren has come to steal it.  The orb has the power to destroy, and if left in the light too long it has the power to destroy the Earth.  We are introduced Red Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen) whose sister was one of the women in the temple and who has taken on the task of retrieving the orb before it can be used to destroy the Earth.  Naturally this quest is also Kalidor's, so though the two take separate paths, they all eventually end up in the same place.Along the way to Gedren's kingdom we encounter Prince Tarn (Ernie Reyes, Jr., ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II"" and ""Surf Ninjas) and his bodyguard and servant Falkon (Paul L. Smith).  Unfortunately, these two characters are the comic relief and while there are a few moments where they are at least humorous, it only takes a while for them to become tedious.The foursome travel to Queen Gedren's kingdom, all the while she continues to make the glowing orb more and more powerful.  She is also aware that Red Sonja and her party are on the way, and tries to prevent them from reaching her kingdom.  One of her attempts involves a giant wind-up toy that makes funny noises and swims in circles, often towing one or more characters from the movie.  Naturally Prince Tarn was part of the reason they encountered the beastie, and no matter how many times I tell him to go back, get out of the water, it just never seems to happen.Ultimately the crew reaches Queen Gedren, there is the obligatory big fight, and things mostly resolve themselves as you would probably expect.There are several remarkable and not-so-remarkable scenes in this movie.  In one of the better scenes the party travels across the backbone of some sort of ancient monster.  When Arnold encounters Red Sonja she is completing some sort of test to prove that she is ready to graduate from the ""Funky Japanese Guy with Stuff Coming out of His Shoulders School of Mystical Sword Work.""  The arena in which she is fighting is cool, but for some reason they put a guy squatting over the entrance that looks to me like someone attempting to perform a bodily function, and I laugh every time I watch it.  The temple of warrior women at the beginning of the movie where the orb is located is also well done, both the interiors and exteriors.  I also thought Queen Gedren had a reasonably well-done castle.This movie has good points and awful points.  The fighting is generally well-done throughout, but there are the usual stupid points.  For example, the warrior women are surrounding the glowing orb, which they plan to lock in the dark forever.  It would seem to the average warrior that a lookout would be advisable.  Second, once the locking procedure started, followed by the attack, all one of the priestess-warriors had to do was kick the key into the same deep pit the orb was going to go into, and the orb would have been closed up while the fighting was going on.  Of course, that would have ended the movie and what fun would that have been.Another problem is that Queen Gedren had this orb with all kinds of power, along with a castle filled with soldiers, and yet she allowed Red Sonja to live, with more than a hint of Gedren's sexual orientation.  Given her megalomaniacal tendencies, you would have thought that Gedren would have summarily disposed of the group.  It just seems like you can't predict the behavior of psychopaths in movies (ever notice that?).Arnold movies usually introduce humor to keep the movie from being too serious, but this time some the humor was ill-timed and often ill planned.  Ernie Reyes, Jr. plays a comedic character, and detracts too much from the plot line.  Similarly, Paul Smith as Falkon was often for comedic effect, and it was too much like watching Laurel and Hardy do Conan rather than a typical Arnold movie.This movie ends up being a movie of contrasts.  The movie begins with an excellent premise.  Portions of the movie are fun to watch.  However, the campy portions drag down the good portions, and all of the potential of the movie is squandered in silliness.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was an excellent Conan, and this movie could easily have been a third Conan movie, particularly given that the two Conan movies were much better done than this movie.  I will recommend that you watch this movie, but do so as a rental rather than a purchase; you'll be happy you did.",N/A
787460,"I don't think Camp was half as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be.  The cast is made of aspiring actors playing aspiring actors.....what could be more appropriate?  Granted their acting skills aren't polished.  But they are portraying actors in musical theater.....their voices are what matters.  And I have to say everyone in the film had fantastic singing voices.  I am glad Camp wasn't cast with young pop stars turned actors (Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, the Olsen Twins, Bow Wow). This cast, imperfections and all, was truer to the form.Even if you don't appreciate musical theater, the theme of kids growing up and trying to find their place in the world is a key part of this movie.What I appreciate most about Camp is how it portrays teens as having aspirations and goals in life.  It's not one of those teen-exploitation films where teenagers are portrayed as being pot smoking, sex-obsessed, and souless (i.e. American Pie).  We need more films that challenge teens, without being ridiculousely wholesome.  Camp has achieved that.",Camp
1213317,"This 18th century costume drama actually stays fairly close to the historical record -- with some changes and adaptations. It tells the story of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who falls into a loveless marriage with an older aristocrat who only wants her to produce a male heir. They get into a weird menage with her best friend who becomes the Duke's mistress. Meanwhile, Georgiana is pining for the embraces of Mr. Grey, an aspiring Whig politician.With gorgeous gowns and wonderful hairdos as well as terrific locations in great English homes like Chatsworth, this movie makes for pleasant viewing without ever engaging the emotions. I did some research which showed it stayed fairly close to the historical record. It did suggest that Georgiana and Charles Grey met and fell in love when she was 17. But he was six years younger than her so that could not have been the case. (This was the Earl Grey after whom the tea is named. As prime minister, he passed the 1832 Reform Act, cutting out some of the worst abuses of the electoral system and setting Britain on its long path to democracy).The movie does cover Georgiana's significant political role. She is also said to have inspired Sheridan's ""School for Scandal."" She was an interesting and significant historical figure.The movie alludes to but glosses over Georgiana's gambling addiction. She died 20,000 pounds in debt which in today's money is a staggering amount of almost Madoff-like proportions.However these are minor cavils. One does not expect a movie to be a historical documentary. My main problem with this film is that I did not for a moment believe I was watching real 18th century characters. I felt more that I was seeing 21st century characters dressed up in 18th century costumes. They did not think or feel like people of their own time, which was considerably different from our own, but appealed to our 21st sensibilities.That particularly applies to the winsome (not to say anorexic) Kiera Knightly who moves languidly through the movie like a fashion model. The problem I find with this actress is that I rarely feel any real appetite for life in her -- for the good or the bad. Everything happens at a remove. Her way of portraying tragedy relies more on makeup than acting and she has an annoying way of sucking in her cheeks to indicate emotion.That said, I still give this movie three stars.

874672,"This is one of those films that looks great when you read the cast list, but that suffers in the execution. It is the terrific acting that carries the viewer through Panic in the Streets' non-plot (actually an Academy Award-winning screen story from the husband and wife team of Edna and Edward Anhalt).Richard Widmark stars as a military doctor who discovers that a recently murdered man had pneumonic plague and would have died in a couple of days anyway. Since it is communicable through the air, he wants to find and quarantine the killer in order to avoid an epidemic.At the same time, he is trying to keep the story from the press -- one tenacious reporter, in particular -- because people will leave town, those already infected spreading the plague over the country (and possibly throughout the world). The meat of Panic in the Streets involves Widmark searching for the killer with local police chief Paul Douglas.The killer is Blackie, played by Jack Palance (or Walter Jack Palance here) in his film debut. When Blackie gets wind of the investigation of the murdered man, he assumes that he had been hiding something and goes after the man's cousin, with flunky Fitch (Zero Mostel) in tow. (Their relationship reminds me of the Warner Brothers duo of Cockney cartoon dogs Spike and Chester (right) -- or Abbott and Costello without the humor.)(About Zero Mostel: Director Kazan would later name Mostel to the House Un-American Activities Committee led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Mostel was one of many who were blacklisted and didn't work in entertainment for most of the 1950s. He would eventually revive his career and appear in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, The Producers, and The Front, a film about the Blacklist).Sprung from a potentially fascinating story, Panic in the Streets is, unfortunately, overlong and contains little suspense about the eventual outcome. On the plus side, Widmark has a terrific talent for palying a regular guy and his antagonistic relationship with Douglas is the heart of the picture (despite Kazan's attempts to do that with Widmark's scenes at home with wife Barbara Bel Geddes).Also, Palance shows why he made a career of playing creeps (and then making fun of that persona in his Academy Award-winning performance in City Slickers): the man has an awesome presence. Mostel, on the other hand, seems to be only going through the motions, giving Fitch none of the depth that he would endow Max Bialystock with almost twenty years later in The Producers.An extra subplot or two might have fleshed out Panic in the Streets closer to perfection but, as it is, it is simply a passably tense film of a universal fear. However, I do hope that this DVD release introduces Richard Widmark to modern audiences. Popular in radio and film (he's likely best known for his darker turn in his debut, Kiss of Death), Widmark has an instantly recognizable voice and a naturalness that makes any performance of his worth watching.",N/A

1529990,"As with the title here, some have called THE AGRESSION SCALE a version of HOME ALONE with the results of the traps seen on screen. That's an apt description. Does it make a good movie? When it comes to originality yes, but in follow through it heads to the mediocre level.Ray Wise plays a mobster just released from jail. Before he heads out of the country and can stand trial he gives his top man Dana Ashbrook an order: find the person who took $500,000 of his money and kill him and his entire family and do it in 48 hours. With few leads to follow Ashbrook and his team go down the list of names they've been given, each leading them closer to the suspect. Not wanting to leave witnesses, they also kill each person they come into contact with.So where is this suspect? He's just remarried a woman who brings along with her late teens daughter, a girl who wants nothing to do with this family or with her new step brother. That stepbrother has a bit of a problem and was recently released from a mental hospital. It seems that he has a tendency towards extreme violence, something measured by what they call the aggression scale. His scores far exceed anything seen before but medication seems to be helping.The bad guys follow their leads until they arrive at the just purchased home of the newly married couple. A combination of torture (not lengthy) and murder leave only the kids left to deal with. But as this team begins to search the house for them, the young boy turns the tables on them, leaving traps and wounding them as he helps his new sister escape.The team tracks the kids down not just through the house but in the surrounding woods as well. Along the way they have serious wounds inflicted upon them by the resourceful kid, some going so far as to be killed in self defense. He may just be a pre-teen but these goons have no idea who they're up against.The idea of having a troubled teen taking on tough guy gangsters sounds like an interesting one. The traps he makes for them are well thought out and vicious at times. When you add the touch of the aggression scale psychological make up to the mix it makes it even more interesting.What stops the movie from being great though is the acting. It's not terrible but it's not quite that good either. Worst of all is the step sister who's screaming while attempting to hide from the bad guys makes her one of the stupidest victims of all time. Hint: when you're being chased, never scream to give away your location.One interesting note among the cast is the coupling of Wise and Ashbrook. Both were part of the now famous series TWIN PEAKS. It's nice to see them reunited here.As I said, the movie isn't that bad and actually has some decent moments in it. You can tell that this one is a low budget flick but in the end it seems better than several big budget films I've seen in the past few years. It may not be for everyone's taste, but if you're looking for something a little different and don't have a problem with low budget style and acting, then give this one a watch.",N/A

The awkwardness of getting caught in a few lies, meeting people who are twisted and a heartbeat away from becoming family, and much bizarre acting out make for some moments of squirm and dark comedy. Don't expect family friendly fare either. There are some awkward sexual comments.There's not a lot of Christmas feel-good spirit in this one. But, if you are a Christmas romantic comedy collector, have a Red Box nearby or a free rental and are a fan of Vince Vaughn or Reese Witherspoon you might want to give it a shot. Some of the physical humor is worth the viewing.",Four Christmases (DVD)
1120682,"The Rendition message...? To be different in America could be costly, especially since certain people have gone power mad and have taken it upon themselves to rend lives in a quest which has derailed egalitarianism. The movie did the job of dramatizing what we all know is actually happening, a campaign to enable Americans to enjoy pristine lives. A high caliber cast of actors served to entice me to watch this DVD.When we bred flesh eating monsters in our own backyard what can we expect? This is so unreal.  We must realize that no matter how strenuous the home-cleaning, the effectiveness will be nullified when the next door neighbour nourishes a house full of rats and roaches.  The process of fumigation will cause some innocent ones to suffer collateral damage during the campaign exercise.  This is real!Who is to blame? How can we safely get the chaff out without destroying the wheat? When will it stop?  Enough already! Everyone must stop the eye gorging before the entire world goes blind.

795364,"Tobe Hoopers 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre was one of thebest horror films ever made. So what about this 2003 re-make? Well, It has it's good and it's bad... It startsout with 5 teens going to a Skynard concert. Problem isI highly doubt Jessica Biel has any Skynard in her coll-ection so it makes that part alittle hard to believe. Butthen the teens pickup a chick that is seemingly in shock.Things start to heat up when she seems them going towardthe same place she was just coming from.. She grows reallyupsetand warns the teens of the danger ahead before puttinga gun in her month and blowing her brains out. You wouldstart to think that the teens would be wary of going anyfurther but they continue on path until they reach a Bar-B-Q/Gas Station. They are then told they must go out inthe countryside to make the report of the girl who commitedsuicide.This is where it all starts... We are lead to about an hourof grewsome murders and sickening personalities by the likesof a old man and a redneck cop(played by the Full MetalJacket drill Sergeant)and of course Leatherface. What makesthis film good is that the teens in this movie are betteractors in the original with the exception of the lead femalein the 1974 movie.We also get more gore than the original. That can be goodsome and bad.... The original wasn't just about murder, itwas also about mental torture. This film doesn't have thatgoing for it... In fact, Jessica Biel doesn't seem like allthat much of a victim. It seems like despite the presenceof Leatherface and the cop that she is still in control.What's good about the film is some good gore the moviegives you a chance to actually care for the victims in-stead of caring less. And as I said, it has better overall acting than the original... It's just ashame thatthe mental torture part of the movie was non existant.One major complaint... The movie had no special featuresat all. Come on, they can give us alittle more than a fewrepetitive trailers.",N/A

Now, that being said, the movie is watchable in the same light as Armageddon, Volcano, Day After Tomorrow, or any of the other ""End of the World"" schlock that exists.  These movies are the 2000s equivalent of the ""post-apocalyptic"" genre of the 80s.What can mankind do to save the ENTIRE world?  Well, a handful of the world's best scientists ought to do the trick.  I was on-board for the ride once this movie got rolling.  I bought into space shuttle landing, I even bought the excessively-long ""pigeon genocide"", but I had to draw the line at ""The-single-female-space-pilot-ties-a-windsor-knot"" scene.  It took me a while to recover from that.All these things being said, I enjoyed the movie.  Truly it is only a time-killer and not to be taken for ANYTHING more than that.  It is not a social statement.  It is not a ""humans-are-bad"" statement.  It is JUST A MOVIE.

226240,"From the moment I heard Dolly Parton's uniquely engaging voice come over my television stereo set singing the theme song to this 80's comedy I knew that I was going to enjoy myself.  I don't know what it is about that woman that I just adore, but whatever, that's neither here nor there.  The fact is that before I even got into the meat of this movie I had made my mind up.  By the time the credits began to roll I have changed my mind completely.  Yet still, by the time I woke up the next morning I had a very different outlook.Okay, so here's the thing; `9 to 5' is a deceitful little thing.This is what I mean.  `9 to 5' is not a laugh out loud type of comedy.  Maybe it is to some, but for me it was one of those `laugh quietly on the inside' type of comedies, and so because of that when the film ends I wound up thinking it wasn't really all that funny.  But it's also one of those comedies that sits well with you.  As you think about it you wind up finding the humor and before long you remember it funnier than when you were watching it.Make sense?So the film revolves around three working women and their egotistical boss.  Violet Newstead is a hard working woman seeking out a promotion that she wholeheartedly deserves; Doralee Rhodes is a hard working secretary just trying to do her job right despite the nasty rumors floating around the office, and Judy Bernly is a recent divorcee who just wants to prove her independence.  The problem they all share is the man they call boss; Franklin M. Hart Jr.When an accident gives sends one of the girls into a panic their lives are forever changed as they find themselves holding their boss hostage, getting involved in blackmail and eventually teaching the man a thing or two about girl-power.As far as the acting is concerned, there are clear standouts and a few disappointing letdowns.  First of all, Dolly Parton is a doll and a comedic knockout; truly the most inspired performance between the three leads.  Jane Fonda, an actress I am not usually smitten with, is less inspired but she manages to be better than I would have given her credit for.  My biggest disappointment came in the form of Lily Tomlin, who I just expected to be amazing.  I usually find her a comedic delight and a true standout in just about everything, but here she was at times rather dull.The truth of the matter is though, that as much as this film is about these three women and their `standing up to the man', it is the man himself that runs away with the entire show.  Yes, Dabney Coleman, AKA Franklin M. Hart Jr. is seriously the funniest and most engaging part of this film.  He nails his character and delivers one of my favorite supporting performances of the said year.So, the film is not as good as I expected (it can feel a little bland at times) but if you let it rest a bit it winds up being funnier the more you think about it.  In parts it's great and so maybe that's why it's funnier to think about than to watch, since when you think about it you think about the better parts.  Anyways, it's worthy watching at least once; if only for the great Coleman and the vivacious Parton.",9 to 5 VHS
1181616,"The Zombie Diaries is basically Blair Witch but with zombies instead of... well, nothing. That sentence alone will probably already tell you if you'll like it or not.It's not a bad film; it's the story of three groups, all with video cameras, recording their experiences during a zombie outbreak in Great Britain. The three seperate stories all co-mingle at the end. The problem is it has 3 HUGE flaws:1: There really isn't any reason for these people to be recording all this. They are literally recording themselves about 80% or more of the time with very little explanation as to why or, indeed, how since they don't seem to have extra film, electricity or batteries. There's really only three times in the film I could see people actually filming the events happening. It gets ridiculous when they record themselves having day to day conversations or when they are supposed to be sneaking through dangerous buildings.2: The zombies are a sideline at best. They rarely show up and they are very much the ""lurking threat"". This isn't really a problem, any good zombie film is about the people, not the undead (with the exception of the excellent Return of the Living Dead) but the camerawork makes the living dead seem strangely mythical in nature; as if they were never really there. Plus, zombie makeup apparently stops at the neck, there's more then a few zombies with very decayed facial features only to have silky smooth Ivory soap hands.3: The director. What? How is the director the one of the biggest flaws? Well, he and another member of the production crew apparently have been making multiple false user names and spamming message boards with how great the film is. Normally, big deal, but when you create converstaions between multiple fake indidviduals and viciously attack anyone who doesn't like the movie, you're doing WAY more harm then good. Go look up Justin-97 at IMDB to see what I mean.Overall, the film was an excellent first try with some intriguing ideas and, with a notable exception, some really good acting and I'd certainly look out for any follow up but I can't say I could recommend it.",N/A

1246641,"'New York, I Love You' is a collection of ten short films on various interpretations/themes of love, all set in the one city in this country that every human being should at least visit before leaving this planet (I can't even put, into words, my love for New York City).  The short films are all VERY loosely (barely) tied together, and feature the strength of some very good actors like Bradley Cooper, Natalie Portman, Orlando Bloom, Christina Ricci, Olivia Thirlby, Anton Yelchin, James Caan, Hayden Christensen, Ethan Hawke, Andy Garcia, Julie Christie, Shia LaBeouf, John Hurt, Cloris Leachman, Robin Wright, Rachel Bilson, Chris Cooper and more.  The films themselves range from just okay to poignant ... but when they're good they are VERY good, particularly in the case of the Christie/Hurt/LaBeouf short, which weeks later still sticks with me emotionally (this one short film contains probably the sweetest, most touching and real performance of LaBeouf's career, so far).  Quirky, sometimes funny, sometimes a bit odd, altogether the films did leave me with the same sense of left-of-center beauty New York itself has always given me - and even though ten films in 103 minutes doesn't leave a lot of room for character or plot development, for this sense of NYC alone (along with the small bunch of shorts here that really stand out from the crowd) 'New York, I Love You' is time well spent for anyone who loves the city ... or finds it fascinating, just the same.","New York, I Love You"

297140,"Private detective Phillip Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) decides to try his hand at writing, in order to supplement the living he ekes out as a shamus, so he pens a story he calls If I Should Die Before I Live. He submits it to a publisher, Kingsby Publishing, and receives a letter from an A. Fromsett, requesting his presence. When he duly presents himself, he discovers that A stands for Adrienne (Audrey Totter) and the lady has something else on her mind besides his story.It sees that Ms. Fromsett is more interested in Marlowe's detective skills than in his ability to wield the literary pen. It seems that her boss, Derace Kingsley (Leon Ames) has a wife that has been missing for a month. A telegram received from El Paso claims that she's run off to get a Mexican divorce and intends to marry Chris Lavery. Fromsett says she wants to find Chrystal Kingsby for her boss's sake, but Marlowe quickly figures out she has her own agenda.She sweetens the pot by adding $300 to the $200 she was going to pay for his story, the additional monies to cover his fees for his services. Kingsby learns of her interfering and lets her know in no uncertain terms that his wife is free to do as she wishes, and that he has no romantic interest in Fromsett.Taking the case, Marlowe goes to Bay City and visits Lavery (Dick Simmons), a southern boy with a smooth way of talking and a way with the ladies. He doesn't take kindly to Marlowe's questions and clocks him. Being a stubborn sort of guy, Marlowe continues to follow the trail and ends up on the wrong side of the Bay City police, especially one Detective Degarmot (Lloyd Nolan).In trying to figure out who's who and what's what, Marlowe has to contend with unfriendly police, a dead lady in a lake, a corpse, a landlady, being set up and jailed, and fighting off feelings for Adrienne. Makes him wonder if perhaps writing isn't a safer career.First, I have to say if you've read the book and enjoyed it, just pretend you haven't or you might be confused and/or dismayed at the film translation. Yes, the basic facts are there, more or less. But there are some significant, as well as minor changes. I understand the constraints of film, but if I hadn't read the book, I think I wouldn't have had a full appreciation for the film. Which isn't to say you have to read the book to enjoy the movie, but it helps.Second, the film employs a technique that was new in its day and I don't believe ever really caught on, although if you watch the film trailer in the extras on the DVD, you'll see it was touted at the time as quite the breakthrough. The camera shows the film from the perspective of Phillip Marlowe, a subjective view. You and Marlowe together view everything. What he sees, you see. When he gets knocked out, your world goes dark too. I guess in theory it sounded better than it was. Or perhaps the director didn't utilize the technique very well. Ironically, Robert Montgomery directed as well as starred in this. But it didn't work for me, and I actually found it annoying, and felt it slowed down the action. I can see why it didn't catch on.Montgomery is the third actor I've seen portray Marlowe, the first two being Bogart and Dick Powell. I rank him third in my list of who did the best job, with Powell at the top. That doesn't make him bad, just not great. Besides, he doesn't spend as much time onscreen, because of the filming technique. Maybe that's a good thing.There are minor changes with names and spelling. In the book, there is no Kingsby Publishing Company, and Marlowe deals with Mr. Kingsley, rather than his subordinate, A. Fromsett.  You may remember the actor who plays Kingsby as the father in Meet Me in St. Louis. Jayne Meadows appears as Mildred Haveland; she was married for many years to comedian Steve Allen. Lloyd Nolan plays the prickly Lieutenant Degarmot. He's done many things over the years. I think of him first as the kindly doctor in the TV series Julia.On the whole, I enjoyed the film, but I think it could be done better. They really missed the boat in not even going up to the lake where the lady in the title is discovered, and we don't meet Bill Chess at all. Those could have been interesting scenes, especially the discovery of the body. Plus it's in the title--Lady in the Lake--but we never see the lake. I think the book could have been adapted better. But, taken as it is, it's a solid watch, although flawed, and if you enjoy Marlowe and want to experience it all, book and film, then it's worthwhile watching.",N/A

It depicts extensive drug use and its ugly aftermath, and it centers on one down on his luck guy named Jack who went from successful businessman to wasted junkie and I'm uncertain whether the director is trying to make an anti-drug statement or is simply showing us this for pure shock value.  The drug-taking scenes are harrowing, more so than the gory scenes when Jack goes bunkers and starts dispatching everyone with the jackhammer of the film's title.  The first half of the film is fine, and Aaron Gaffey's performance is believable and dedicated, it's the second half that falters, where we are introduced to a bunch of awfully acted characters that are there only to be massacred and unfortunately the lack of suspense adds to the tedium and pointlessness of it all.  The special effects are good though, and some will make you cringe (Jack's infected arm is barf-inducing).

1233615,"1. I think the idea of telling the story from the point of view of the Manipulated Dead instead of the Living Reciever was great. 2. I think the idea of continuing the story using Samantha Darko was great. 3. I believe Iraq Jack was a brilliant character.These great ideas, unfortunately were poorly executed. Here's why I think this way:1. As I have watched Donnie Darko, I have certainly wondered what it was like for Frank the Bunny. He was the second most important character in Donnie Darko but we know virtally nothing about him. So I could certainly understand why someone would want to write a movie from this perspective. I think the reason it was so poorly done in the movie is because the idea that Samantha Darko would be the Manipulated Dead is just downright stupid and illogical. The Manipulated Dead should have been a completely different character.2. Continuing the tale from Samantha Darko's perspective is brillant. Why? Because she would have found the book The Philosophy of Time Travel. She would have been motivated to find out why her brother had this book and what the book meant. She could have tracked down someone who knew Roberta Sparrow, leading her to Iraq Jack. Then Fisher (the director)could have explored Roberta's back story like he said he considered doing in the special features on the DVD. Perhaps Corey could have still been a part of it. A friend occupying her on her journey trying to run from her past, while Samantha was trying to find information so she could understand hers.3. And while these two young women are trying to deal with their past, Samantha meets Iraq Jack (and some of the towns characters. A few of them were nothing but filler in this movie.). The character of Iraq Jack was the one character that the creators got right in this movie. Unfortunately, they do very little to let us get to know him. In Donnie Darko, Donnie's identity and angst was explored in great detail. The creators of this movie should have done the same with Iraq Jack, exploring the depths of his post traumatic stress disorder and need to do something to right all his wrongs. If Samantha had watched his life unfold in a similar way that Donnie's had, she could have understood what Donnie went through, realized her brother was a hero, and made peace with his death. Samantha would have had a huge character change by the end and been a lot less passive.Ultimately, I think the director Chris Fisher made a fairly good fan fiction movie, but nothing more. I give the movie 3 stars because there were some brillant ideas in there. Samantha's role as the Manipulated Dead does perhaps help us understand the incredible character of Frank the Bunny a bit more. I think the subplot of the asteroid affecting the person studying it was vulgar and ruined the beauty and mystery of the Donnie Darko universe. It just didn't fit in with the rest of the story. The asteroid shower was hardly end of the world like. The scene where Iraq Jack goes back to the windmill to change his fate was great but everything else just fizzles at the end.In the special features, nearly everyone's gut reation to the idea of making a continuation of Dannie Darko was DON'T! The fact that The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko was somewhat poorly recieved should have made Fisher realize his continuation would not be well received. It's almost as if he thought, ""Die hard fans will hate this movie, but they will still want to see it."" There just seems to be something very wrong with that. Egotistical even.",N/A
1186587,"This is the other movie I watched on the plane ride (on a double feature with Nick and Norah). Wonderfully depressing movie, about a aimless loner with no money, no job and no personality. I had a hard time feeling empathy for the lead character, which means I had hard time liking this film. Michelle Williams does a terrific job conveying the desperation and loneliness of Wendy's life, and her minimilist acting is pitch-perfect for the role. I wish I could swap her out with Jolie in the 'Changeling' - one is a great movie with a decent actress, while this is a mediocre film with a great performance.",Wendy and Lucy
1031703,"Pairing Salma Hayek and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz in a campy, comic buddy western turns out to be a mildly amusing ploy, but I just wish this 2006 film had more true grit and a sharper sense of the characters than the screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen exhibits. As vividly beautiful as the two actresses are, together they are physically and temperamentally too similar to be credible opposites. They are both compelling enough presences onscreen, especially playing such self-sufficient women, but the lack of contrast makes it hard to think they are little more than two halves of the same character. They are guided by first-time filmmakers Joachim Roenning and Espen Sandberg, which may account for the lack of visual flair that Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Tarantino could have brought to the story. Regardless, the pacing is lightning-quick, and the cartoonish touches provide the requisite popcorn entertainment.Set in turn-of-the-last-century Mexico, two women are leading separate lives - Sara Sandoval is the pampered, worldly daughter of a wealthy landowner, and Maria Alvarez is the dirt-poor farm girl who has relied on her horse sense and keen marksmanship. Their paths cross when seedy, bloodthirsty robber baron Tyler Jackson steals from their respective fathers and kills them both. Naturally, Sara and Maria seek revenge but must settle their own class-conflict squabbling first (via the inevitable cat-fighting scene). With the help of grizzled former bank robber Bill Buck, Sara and Maria become ""Las Bandidas"", Mexico's version of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Things get complicated when Jackson hires New York criminologist Quentin Cooke to track down the women, but you can probably guess that Quentin succumbs to their ample charms. The script throws in some interesting economic theory discussions, but mostly flimsy excuses are made to insert some silly scenes like having the women dress as saloon prostitutes out of the Moulin Rouge to seduce Quentin.Other than the mandatory gunplay, the elaborate stunts include a Tarzan-like use of a swinging chain, the creative use of ice skates during a heist, a slo-mo action scene that feels stolen fromThe Matrix, and a paean to the famous river-jumping scene inButch Cassidy. There is no doubt that Cruz and Hayek are having a good time, though they are hardly stretched here. Even though they bond in a predicable way, it would have been more interesting to insert some ambiguity along the lines ofThelma & Louise. With his bedraggled Marilyn Manson-like hair bested only by Javier Bardem's pageboy inNo Country for Old Men, Dwight Yoakam is not quite as menacing a presence as Walker. Steve Zahn also seems comparatively passive as Quentin, even though he looks appropriately dazed in the seduction scene. Sam Shepard is barely in the film as Buck, but he makes his brief sequence count with reliable authority. The extras on the 2007 DVD are sparse - a superficial four-minute making-of featurette, the original theatrical trailer, and a commentary track by Hayek and Cruz, has entertainment value but not too much insight into the production itself.",Bandidas
520314,"First off, let me put it right on the table: I have never read ""The Lord of the Rings"", though years ago I did read ""The Hobbit"". Now I'm something of an anomaly in my family, because all the otherGuys'n'Gals did devour this trilogy. So really, for someone who never read it, I've certainly heard enough about it over the years. I know character and place names, the way children sometime pick up details about the parents' childhoods through hearing twicetold tales.Twenty years ago, I saw the lambasted cartoon version of LofR. Well, contrary to what so many have said--I don't see the difference between the two! I mean, that wasn't SO bad, but this is not at ALL as good as I was led to believer. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this movie badly: after all, threee hours is quite an investment of one's time. But I felt cold and unaffected by the goings-on. Probably didn't help that I was there on an unsatisfactory date, either. But all the more reason to escape into fantasy, you see!And the one detail that annoyed me more than anything else, was this: There are SO many scenes of an outstretched palm on which the ring is sitting. Every single palm--and there were several that had a go at this--was filthy dirty. One friend countered and said that I had to understand that folks were on this journey and would of course get dirty. But I turned right around and said, Yeah but this ISN'T a depiction of real life in the Middle Ages, it's a a fantasy. So why couldn't these people be clean? I had silenced my opposition.Think you really had to be already into this scene to get much out of the adventure besides a stiff neck.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

Nowhere in this collection are there any mention of Daniel's prophecies concerning the 70 weeks or any attempted explanations of Ezekiels 430 days.

1334750,"First let me say I am a major fan of disaster movies; they are armchair adventures for me and I watch a lot of them. This movie, for plot, acting or special effects in no way comes even close to matching 2012, the major movie release of last year.  This particular movie is made on a very small budget; if you have watched any of the disaster movies shown on the SYFY channel, you have a good idea what you are in for here. There are computer generated special effects, some pretty good, some pretty obvious, such as the subzero blizzard in the tropics that doesn't seem to bother the plants at all or make the actors appear to be particularly cold in their tropical clothing. On the plus side, the movie was largely filmed in Belize using at least some footage of a Mayan temple, which helps a bit there.  The basic plot of the movie has various people attempting to get to a Mexican Mayan pyramid by Dec. 21st in order to fulfill a Mayan/Christian prophecy.  There are some major holes in the logic of the film, such as why the Mayans would incorporate Christianity into the design of a pyramid long before the arrival of the Spanish,  but NOT incorporate it into their lives and culture. The movie is produced by a company called Faith Films which explains why,  several times in it's approximately 80 minute running time,  it seems to grind to a halt to deliver a mini-sermon. Most of the action takes place in out of the way locations and involves a small number of people; considering the world is threatened with total destruction,  I am not sure where the rest of us are and why we don't seem to care; are we all hiding in our basements?

Unbeknownst to me, I rented a movie that should have ended 30 minutes before it actually did. While the story started out well, it ended giving me the same feeling that I had with watching Nic Cage in City of Angels.....I just kinda felt like the characters sucked in ether and stopped participating in the film itself. I get the point of the movie but I don't equate pennance and guilt with walking around beautiful countryside wide eyed and saying very little. And I would never make a confession to someone who held obsessive love for me.

1209444,"The story goes that whenToy Storywas first envisioned, it was as Yet Another of their award winning animated shorts until somewhere along in the process someone got the bright idea of turning it into Pixar's first feature.The rest, as they say, is history.  If something similar was going on with this movie, and I suspect that it was, it is proof that longer is not always better, not even from Pixar.  They took the potential Best Animated Short EVER and turned it into a so-so 90-minute movie.The beginning is animation and movie making at its best; the short scene depicting a lifetime of marriage with nary a word spoken may be the most emotionally moving piece of animation ever created; and the scene where the house takes flight is, figuratively and literally, the high point of the movie.  A short coda, say showing future explorers finally reaching the top of the falls and finding the house impossibly but successfully perched there, would have finished off a stunning animated short.  Pixar chose to continue on, unwisely IMHO, because once you've reached the high point the only way to go is down.The first descent was to turn this movie into Yet Another story of an irascible old man coping with a child who fails to grasp that he isn't really wanted, hardly the most original idea, though setting it in a floating house provides some novelty.  Will a persistentDennisfinally melt Mr. Wilson's icy heart?...  Uh, that is, will a persistent Russell finally melt Mr. Fredericksen's icy heart?  Especially with the added poignancy of Russell's quixotic motive: winning back the love and attention of a father lost through divorce?Do you really have to ask?The second descent was to blow away any remaining realism by introducing talking dogs and a gigantic reject from the cast of Pixar's academy-award-winning shortFor the Birds.  This produces lots of funny jokes, but at the expense of any remaining plausibility,...and causes serious problems for the third descent: the return of a forgotten character as an embitteredCaptain Nemo, a mad genius turned killer because the world has wronged him.  This mixture of darkness and light, grimness and whimsy, simply fails to work at all, not least because the villain ought to be over a hundred years old by now.Finally, this movie gets an ""F"" for its understanding of the problems ofCryptozoology.  As a practical matter, in order to protect a rare and endangered animal you first have to prove that it exists, and that ultimately requires a specimen.  If you can bring it in alive, so much the better, but bring it in you must.  As one by no means heartless or cruel scientist investigating Bigfoot put it, we need a body.  The first hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be given a medal; the second hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be SKINNED.  Now, it is perfectly understandable that people would be squeamish about this idea when we are talking about, at the very least, aman-like creature, what Edgar Rice Burroughs would call ananthropoid ape, but it is sheer idiocy to take this attitude about a giant bird that in real life would have been following Russell and Mr. Fredericksen...in order to kill and eat them.",N/A

972845,"After the vast success of ""Three Extremes"" three other Asian horror savants (South Korea's Kim Je-Woon, Thailand's Nonzee Nimibutr, China's Peter Chan) stepped up to the plate to deliver us a successor.The original had three tales of distinct horror methods--one of gross-outs, one of violence, and one of psychological maiming. ""Three Extremes II"" however, seems to have a common theme about all three which is the voyage of the afterlife.Due to atmospheric and thematic similarities I found the stories a little less engaging when viewed back-to-back. Perhaps this could've been that the first two films of the movie (the first especially) were rather uneventful.Starting chronologically, the short ""Memories"" by Kim Je-Woon is South Korea's entry into the anthology. It starts with promise as it shows a man presumably sleeping on a couch and very gradually pans closer and closer to him. Then it shows us more of the room he is in, and immediately Je-Woon strikes a nerve of undeniable creepiness with a huddled women rocking to and from in a corner. This sense of uneasiness quickly dissolves as the story progresses. Nothing really happens throughout. Like I said above it was uneventful--sure people are talking (though there's an odd lack of dialogue in ""Memories""), sure they're walking and driving around trying to discover a mystery, but it's a mystery most viewers have probably solved. There's also a woman who seems to have lost her memory, but almost immediately I put two-and-two together and figured out her connection with our main character. Je-Woon uses rather cheap shock-tactics like sudden movements and sharp music to make us jump. Its unfortunate Kim Je-Woon's entry was so weak narrative-wise and predictable story-wise, because he is the director of one of my favorite movies ever ""A Tale of Two Sisters"". I went in hoping for something exquisite from him but got a rather generic story. I do not dislike the movie, because it does have its pluses like solid acting, beautiful camerawork, and the cutest child you'll ever see in any movie, but I cannot say I liked it either because there was so little story. All-in-all, Kim Je-Woon's ""Memories"" is forgettable, shiny, and predictable--nothing more than you'd expect from one of Hollywood's J-horror remakes.The middle segment on the disc is one of Thai origins called ""The Wheel"" from director Nonzee Nimibutr. Being only briefly acquainted with Thai horror, I found myself excited to see what Thailand had to offer. Many reviews claim this to be the flimsiest entry, but I have to disagree. I think most of ""The Wheel"" was lost in translation because it is a piece so close to Thailand. It's a cultural short involving Thai beliefs that we North American viewers simply cannot grasp--or at least not appreciate fully. That being said, I personally loved the cultural experience of watching ""The Wheel"" and felt almost like it was a documentary of rural Thailand. The set design is beautiful and exotic; the costumes and puppets are breath-taking and unique; the entire piece rings with foreign flavor, and was a nice contrast to ""Memories"" which could've been copied and pasted into any country's film. That being said, while it dealt with horror (spirits, possession and vengeance) it didn't feel like a full-feldged horror. The very opening is chilling but like ""Memories"" it fades to black rather quickly. Unlike ""Memories"" I found myself interested by the foreign aspect and the beauty of the setting, from the murky lagoon to the unique houses to the vibrant costumes. The acting throughout is rocky--there's a few actors who deliver questionable performances, and that is probably my biggest qualm with the film. Aside from that it had a very redeeming ending, and in more ways than one.The closing piece is absolutely and without question my favorite of the three, and probably my favorite out of the original three as well. I think the DVD editors placing Peter Chan's ""Going Home"" last was strategy, as they started with the most feeble and the ""Going Home"" segment is powerful enough to make you forget about ""Memories""'s weakness and leaves you with a very positive feeling after watching. Had they reversed the order, the haunting touch of ""Going Home"" wouldn't have survived through the end of ""Memories"" and my review would be two starts instead of three. That may sound ridiculous but it's all too true. The story starts with a single father and his son who are moving into a new complex, one that looks decrepit and neglected. This dirty setting is awesome for capturing what will happen later. Chan's direction then switches from the father-son relationship and to a much more aberrant relationship concerning a rather shoddy character we're introduced to through the young son and a wife who is seemingly long-dead. This is a ghastly, provocative, touching story of requited love and the testing of lengths one will go through for that love. I will not delve any further into the story--discover this gem on your own. If anything this DVD is worth the $15 for this piece alone--I wish it could've been a feature length film.Overall, ""Three Extremes II"" doesn't succeed as horror but are an excellent trio of chilling dramas. It was a disappointing follow-up to ""Three Extremes"" but the two shouldn't be compared because they are different films with different messages. I picture only a fan of Asian horror liking this DVD, so if you're new perhaps go with something more user-friendly before diving into this piece.6.5/10",Three Extremes Ii
15820,"The film gets 3.5 stars, the DVD 2. (Hey Wes, no commentary? You knew we'd be scrambling for Bottle Rocket once Rusmore was released...)This film is like a Wes Anderson dress rehersal. It has the same off-beat characterization, unique camera work, and moments of hilarity. But it's clearly Anderson's vision in the incubation stage--the film left me wanting, like watching a short that was unnaturally stretched to feature length.Owen Wilson plays Digan wonderfully, the man just not smart enough to become a master criminal. In fact, his entire view of the world is so contrived once senses that he was inspired to a life of crime by watching an A&E; special. His sidekicks are equally clueless, but lack Dignan's near-insane commitment to a life of crime.The narrative however is weakned by the love story, however charming and sweet. Luke Wilson's character--somewhat indecisive and melancholy to begin with--suddenly comes across like your typical schnook from a John Hughes movie.The strength of the movie lies in the Big Caper and all the planning (and botches) that precede it. James Caan was brilliant as the local boss and would-be kingpin, who tries to give the boys from Plano a little taste of reality.It reminds me a lot of another very funny, young Texan road flick: Fandango. But unlike this Kevin Costner predecessor, Bottle Rocket tends to wander, and lacks a lot of genuine emotion. Overall, it's a respectable debut film and is interesting to see the earlier fruits of Wes Andersons's creativity. As far as 1990s indie films go, you could do much worse...I recommend renting it first and watching it more than once before buying.",Bottle Rocket
488739,"Produced in English by Harvey Weinstein's company, it's odd that this two year old film has never been released officially in the U.S. Fortunately for me; I found this at a used store for only two bucks. It's the Chinese release of the film but there were English subtitles. The price is worth it although the film is a fairly standard war drama/mystery set in the eponymous city in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. There's plenty of noir-ish spy type confusion and the scenery is well reproduced.The acting is good, even from Cusack, a guy I'm not sold on. Buying him as a fedora-sporting agent was a bit much, but he avoided his typical Cusack mannerisms. Gong Li plays the wife to mob boss Chow Yun Fat and Ken Watanabe is the Japanese officer in charge of suppressing the Chinese resistance movement. I've yet to see any of those three phone in a performance and they don't do so here, either. I find it interesting if even a bit courageous that Watanabe is willing to play a person with a certain level of moral hesitation given the grim history between China and Japan that still simmers today. He is not the cartoonish evil Japanese military officer and for that the film gets some props because there is a level of moral ambiguity the characters wrestle with, not unlike the characters in another Shanghai-based war movie, Ang Lee's Lust, Caution.Shanghai is a mid-level big production film that harkens back to the noir-ish war films of the 40s. With a cadre of very good Asian actors and some good Yank ones as well, coupled with a quick moving story and some nice cinematic eye candy, it's not a bad movie to spend some time with, especially if you can find it for two bucks. Sadly, that is, if you can find it at all.",Shanghai (2010) DVD [Official Dual Language Edition]
1578903,"Jack Benny is my favorite comedian, with George Burns a close second.  Both are present on these Jack Benny programs along with Benny regulars Don Wilson, Dennis Day, Frank Wilson, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, Mel Blanc, and one episode with Mary Livingstone.  Special guests featured included John Wayne, Spike Jones, Milton Berle, Gary Cooper, Rock Hudson, Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood, Billy Graham, Harry Truman, and many more.  However, some of the shows - especially the Gary Cooper and Harry Truman were of extremely poor quality which was a big disappointment.  I don't think any restoration was done on these episodes which were from kinescopes.  Some of the later episodes look better but it is a shame that they all did not have the same restoration efforts on all episodes.  The bonus features ranged from a very interesting interview with some of those who worked with Benny to some disappointing color episodes where Benny goes to introduce Frank Sinatra or Dinah Shore singing a song but you never get to hear the song!  The worse was so called Hearst Newsreel that I had thought from the title would be actual newsreel footage but seemed more like rehearsal since the same lines were said over and over again.  I always think Benny is funnier on radio where your imagination takes over.  I rate this a five as anything with Benny is always good and seeing some of this footage that I have never seen before was exciting but I rate it as a one for the quality of the non-existent ""restorations"" and the disappointing bonus features so it ends up a three.  I think a better job could have been done on this set.",The Jack Benny Program: The Lost Episodes
829879,"I did like this movie. My purpose in watching it was to get a general outline--or at least a feel--for what the Book of Mormon contains. Additionally, in fairness, the movie should be compared with other movies produced by religious houses, such as Ten Clouds (Left Behind I, II, & III, etc.). In this light, the film fairs well. The acting is reasonably believable, though occasionally modern dialogue slips into this historic drama. The effects, while probably subpar by Hollywood standards, are high-medium for religious films. OK, the scene where Nehi ""shocks"" his brothers was pretty feeble!The plot is the key here. While the target audience would certainly be primarily Mormon, the LDS church surely hopes that some non-members will see the film and become curious. In that vein, the film does a decent job of presenting a story that very few actually know. In doing so, the story feels very much like one that might have been done about Joseph, or the 10 Commandments, etc. In fact, some of the parallels were clearly intentionally. This story is meant to feel like a biblical epic.I was surprised to learn that the movie came out in 2002. Nearly five years, and still no part II? Like Left Behind, future episodes are likely to be direct-to-dvd. The big let down for fans who like this series, is that there seems to be a distinct possiblitity it will not see its way to completion.Bottom-line: Three stars for a religious movie that compares favorably with others in the genre, and succeeds in creating the feel of a biblical epic. Detractions are occasional uneven scenes, and the possiblity, even likelihood, that this series will not be completed.",N/A
1098524,"Captivity starts with a grisly murder, a scene reminiscent of each of the worst scenes in any of the Saw movies.  A hooded, disguised killer has a victim strapped to a chair, with a tube in his mouth.  The tube is connected to some sort of toxic chemical, and there is no way for the tube to be removed.  It's clear that the victim is horrified, and completely aware of the impending doom.  It's creepy, ominous, and sets a great tone for the remainder of the movie.Elisha Cuthbert is stunning as she plays Jennifer Tree, a hyper-busy, some what conceited covergirl/model, constantly doing interviews, and appearing on TV.  She lives life beyond the means of most, going so far as buying gourmet food for her dog!  This attention, however, draws some unwanted attention that eventually causes problems.Shortly into the film, it becomes clear that Jennifer is being stalked and filmed, establishing very clear foreshadowing, and causing the viewer to connect her potential attacker and the previous murder.  Sure enough, she's drugged, abducted, and the stage is set for the rest of the movie.It's really a cross between the riddles of Saw and Se7en, the imprisonment of Kiss the Girls, and the torture aspect of Hostel.If viewers can get past the borderline plot plagiarism, the suspense is actually somewhat enticing, the acting fairly believable, and the scenarios quite ingenius and terrifying.  Elisha Cuthbert is mesmerizing, absolutely stealing every scene; she's an absolute star whose beauty is truly worth the price of admission.  Although, it's hard to watch a single scene without thinking of a myriad other horror movies from which ""Captivity"" borrowed various concepts.It's mindless gore, suspense, and screams for the not-so-faint-hearted.  It's exactly what one would expect, and an overall thrilling ride.",N/A
854225,"Interesting film about a supposedly straight student making a film about the experiences of gay men in the Muslim communities of North Africa.  Along the way he develops a close relationship with one of his subjects.  The interesting thing about ""The Road to Love"" is that it is not the resulting documentary, but rather a documentary about the student making the documentary.Shot directly to video, the production values are very low. The photography is grainy, the sound is muddy, the editing choppy.  The acting is often amateurish.  There are two possible explanations for these flaws.  (1) This could be the result of a shoestring budget, or (2) it could be a deliberate attempt at cinema verite, or quite possibly both.  I prefer to give the director the benefit of the doubt and view it as cinema verite.  Cinema verite can be quite annoying at times, as this picture sometimes is.There are some funny moments as the student tries to find suitable subjects for his project and encounters some oddballs who have ideas of their own.Although only 70 minutes long, the movie drags in spots and is at times repetitious.

The movie starts badly, like a black comedy that is not funny.Then it turns into an interesting story. We learn that Jackson's character is a widower with a teenage daughter. The wife got killed by a burgler and then the burgler got killed by somebody while in prison. His best pal in the force was Ed Harris, who was somehow involved in everything.

As a general rule, these segments will have to last at least 7 minutes.BOOKERT/GOLDUST defeated CHRIS JERICHO/CHRISTIAN, LANCE STORM/WILLIAM REGAL & THE DUDLEY BOYZ in an Elimination Match to Win the World Tag-Team Titles: The first 6 minutes of this opener was disappointingly terrible. But following the practically simultaneous elimination of The Dudleyz & Storm/Regal, the remaining 2 teams showed why this bout should have been a normal tag match. The remaining 10 minutes was a hot & predominantly crisp bout, with excellent exchanges right up until the crowd-pleasing finale. Match Rating...7EDGE defeated A-TRAIN: I thought that this bout should have been a 'No Holds Barred' Match, in order to gain some sort of interest for this lifeless feud. Even at 7 minutes, this match went on too long. It ended with Albert using a chair to disqualify himself. Not as horrible as it could have been, but not that pretty either. Match Rating...5CHRIS BENOIT defeated EDDIE GUERRERO: A technical masterpiece, this bout showed why these 2 superstars are recognized as 2 of the best mat technicians ever. A match that highlighted the great intensity of both combatants, I'm going to be ultra critical & state that there wasn't enough fast-paced high-flying action thrown into this 17 minute match. Guerrero finally tapped to a crossface that Benoit applied from the opposite side than usual. Match Rating...8DAWN-MARIE, AL & TORRIE WILSON Segment: A segment has to be really good to be given over 15 minutes on a pay-per-view. This wasn't!!! Sure, some teenage males may have got something out of it, but even that could have been done in less time. I wonder how many parents would have been put off by this segment...??? The one thing the segment did succeed in doing, was heating up the crowd. That can't be denied, but almost one tenth of the whole event was spent on this. Segment Rating...3BATISTA defeated KANE: Folks, this was a painful 7 minutes to watch. This match was just plain horrible at times. Everything seemed wrong, even the timing of Flair's interference. I've been saying it for months; As good as Batista's potential is, he clearly is not ready for a singles push yet. Match Rating...4VICTORIA defeated TRISH STRATUS & JACQUELINE to Retain the Womens Title: This triple-threat match was extremely fast-paced early on & I was wondering how long the 3 combatants could keep it up for. Then I realized why it was so frenetic. When you're only given 4 minutes or so to work with, you have to go that fast. The entire ppv did run over time & I got the feeling that this was the match that suffered the consequences. I actually didn't mind the match until the ridiculous finish that saw Victoria pin Jackie following a belt shot to the head. Why wouldn't they let Victoria use that devastating finisher of hers? Match Rating...6KURT ANGLE defeated THE BIG SHOW to win the WWE Championship: Major props to Kurt Angle in this match. To show the intensity & enthusiasm that he did to get such a good 13 minute match out of The Big Show, is exactly why the WWE needs Kurt to be the face of the WWE in 2003. Genuinely well put together match with a crowd-pleasing ending. Match Rating...7TRIPLE H defeated SHAWN MICHAELS 2 Falls To 1, to win the World Heavyweight Title: Hard to rate, this match seemed to lack the freshness of the duo's SummerSlam bout, nor equal the brilliance of Triple H's '2 out of 3 falls' match against Steve Austin at No Way Out 2001. But comparing this match to 2 matches I rated a perfect 10, is definitely a compliment. The effort these 2 put into the 22 minute streetfight, 10 minute cage match & 8 minute ladder match cannot be questioned. Far from perfect, the sum total of 40 minutes was nonetheless entertaining, and at the end of the day, being entertained is why we as fans watch professional wrestling. Match Rating...8PPV RATING (48/80) = 60Looking at the key, I have basically given Armageddon a 'C+' grade & said that it was 'worth a watch'. It only just got into that rating range, yet I'm still happy with that overall grade & comment. It was an up-and-down pay-per-view event.",WWE Armageddon 2002

277751,"&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is the brilliant spoof and satire of 'traditional' family life, set during the depression. From the narrative rose-colored memories of his own childhood, Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) reflects on the year when he desired nothing more than to own his own shot gun. Mom (Melinda Dillon), of course, is dead set against the purchase. Dad (Darrin McGavin) might be a bit more receptive to the idea, having just won a company sponsored contest in which the grand prize is a fish-netted stocking lamp. A slew of calamities ensue that perfectly and poignantly capture all of the clich? and kitsch of the period. Who can forget the incident at school where Schwartz?s (R.D. Robb) tongue gets glued to an ice cold metal pole on a dare, or the hilarious Christmas dinner scene at a Chinese restaurant? When Mr. Parker declares that he can?t eat the goose he?s been served because ?it?s staring at me? a diligent waiter produces a cleaver and promptly decapitates the bird right in front of the whole family.  Mmmm, yummy!  Truly, this is one funny film!Warner gives us an average effort in their DVD remastering of this film. Previously, ?A Christmas Story? had been made available in a full frame only edition with no extras. This time around we are given an anamorphic widescreen transfer but contrast levels continue to be too low and the colors, somewhat muted. Certain scenes are incredibly soft while others suffer from considerable film grain. Pixelization, aliasing and edge enhancement exist throughout. The audio is mono and nicely balanced. Disappointing - nevertheless.The author of the book - Jean Shepherd, reads his story as part of the extra features that also include a new documentary on the making of the film and some hidden easter eggs (how ironic - easter eggs for Christmas!) as well as the theatrical trailer and a generally benign trivia game.",A Christmas Story VHS

(Never seen THAT flick before, huh?)My two cents: I've gotta give writer/director Holland credit for inventiveness and guts: he puts it all out there. But... he puts it ALL out there, and for every bit that really works, there's one that really doesn't. David Odgen Stiers as the concerned dad is appealing; Kim Darby as the over-the-top mom is appalling. The foreign-exchange student routine works well enough; the drug-challenged best friend doesn't. Thumbs-down to the talking scribbles, singing burgers and the whole skiing subplot; thumbs-up to the Howard Cosell drag-racers, the over-achieving little brother and the endless series of guys wanting to hit on Cusack's ex.If you really want to see a five-star comedy about a disoriented kid with a suicide complex, check out ""Harold and Maude"".

352777,"Based on a best-seller by Thomas B. Costain, and directed by Victor Saville, ""The Silver Chalice"" was one of the studio's early CinemaScope films, and was really a variation on Fox's ""The Robe,"" the first CinemaScope movie that had been a huge success in 1953... The action follows a group of Christians who are dedicated to preserving Christ's Holy Cup twenty years after the Last Supper...Since Newman had the lead as a young Greek silversmith, sold into slavery, then chosen by the Christians to design a chalice for the Cup, becomes involved in battles and orgies, and must decide between the pagan world represented by a courtesan (Virginia Mayo) and the Christian world represented by his young, innocent wife (Pier Angeli). There is also a mad pagan magician (Jack Palance), who wants to destroy the chalice and establish his own religion, replacing Christ's miracles with black magic...Newman was ideally cast as a Greek, because of his classic features, but he makes his film debut at particularly unfortunate time... 1954 was the year of ""The Wild One"" and ""On the Waterfront,"" and Brando was at the height of his popularity...",The Silver Chalice VHS
1683980,"Ben Stiller's middle-brow extravaganza almost wasn't his.  They've tried to make this movie for 20 years, and the story of the making of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is ultimately more interesting than the movie itself.  Here are some clips from what I call ""The Secret Life of 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'"": (roll film!)-- Samuel Goldwyn Jr. came up with the idea in 1994, and Disney was enthusiastic.  Instead,-- New Line Cinema was chosen, because Goldwyn would retain creative input, and because they were on good terms with Jim Carrey, who was the first choice as Mitty-- First screenwriters: Babaloo Mandell, Lowell Ganz-- Ron Howard was first tapped to direct, but he decided to make ""EdTV"" instead-- ""Mitty"" languished for 5 years because no one could figure out how to make the 1939 Thurber story seem contemporary.  Finally, New Line asked Chuck Russell to rewrite the screenplay and direct.  But New Line pushed back the scheduled 2000 release-- In 2001, Goldywn sued New Line for breach of contract, claiming New Line was going to dump the project on another studio and thereby block any ""creative input"" from Goldwyn-- Goldwyn won the suit, taking the project to Paramount-- Paramount was working with DreamWorks on ""Lemony Snicket"", and Spielberg got everyone interested in Jim Carrey again as Mitty-- Spielberg agreed to direct, and brought in DreamWorks to help finance the project (DreamWorks was bought by Paramount in 2006)-- Zach Helm wrote another script-- Spielberg and DreamWorks, however, decided to bail on ""Mitty"" in favor of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Munich""-- Richard LaGravenese wrote another script, with the stated goal of going ""back to the short story and capture not only the content but the original spirit"", according to Goldwyn's kid John.  (Obviously, our ""Mitty"" isn't the LaGravenese version)-- In 2005, Mark Waters was tapped to direct, but Carrey bailed-- Enter Owen Wilson in the role of ""Mitty""-- Paramount lost the rights because it took too long to make the film.  Owen Wilson bailed over ""creative differences""; Scarlett Johansson was considered for the female lead but she never signed the contract-- Goldwyn took the project to 20th Century Fox in 2007-- Another script rewrite, this time by Jay Kogen, who tailored the script for Mike Myers, who was now tapped for ""Mitty""-- 2010.  Myers gone, Sacha Baron Cohen was announced as ""Mitty"".  Steven Conrad wrote another script (the one we have now, more or less); Gore Verbinski would direct-- 2011.  Ben Stiller was announced as ""Mitty"".  Verbinski gave up direction for a producers's credit, and Stiller himself would directWhew!  Now THAT'S an adventure, more fraught with danger than what Stiller faces in Iceland and Afghanistan in the actual movie.  I spent so much time describing the troubled production history of the movie (which will NOT be included on your Blu-Ray extras, collectors) because there's so little to say about what I just saw.  It's not *bad*, by any means.  Stiller proves himself to be somewhat of a revelation as a director: some of the shots, especially the overhead stuff early in the film at the Time-Life building, and the sequence where Mitty skateboards down a deserted Icelandic highway, are quite stunning.  Sean Penn has a nice moment in a cameo role as The Most Interesting Man in the World.  But this movie isn't the story of Thurber's Walter Mitty, who is a daydreamer and not a doer.  Rather, it's the story of Everyman, seething away in quiet desperation in his cubicle five days a week.  Finally, the shlub goes out and DOES something.  Naturally, the movie has been a smashing success with the 30-55 demographic -- also seething away in cubicles -- to whom it's targeted.  But this new, reimagined Mitty -- ok, this rebooted Mitty, if you must -- doesn't connect on a human level.  He's like a light switch: he's a drone, and then he's Indiana Jones.  He the product of a screenwriter more concerned with getting from Point A to Point B than with creating a real person.But the film is beautifully made, and it's pretty churlish to despise a movie that so firmly believes that travel can make us better people.

Boss Hog is dead in the first film and jessie is dead in the second, this makes the show seem morbid and depressing when they talk about it.  There is too much of the characters, of new characters, and very little of the CAR which is the real star of the show.

The group becomes trapped and, one by one, the supporting cast members fall prey to nasty bugs of all shapes and sizes.

We pretty much see everything coming from a mile away. I did enjoy the scenes of mid-90s Miami, but I would have enjoyed even more. They are mostly just pretty backgrounds, and not closeups so it's hard to identify where they were shot. Since I lived there, that would have been of interest to me.

279100,"This is a movie made during WWII at a time when it was not entirely clear just who would win the war. It is as much war propaganda as anything else, but virtually all war movies of that period were. It is typically on cable TV around Memorial Day. I DVR'd it and just got around to watching it last night.Other war time movies were also little more than war propaganda, but were done much better. I never believed the witty repartee amongst the crew nor did I believe Cary Grant's portrayal of a sub captain.The premise of the movie was that for some reason the navy sends this sub to Japan to collect some kind of unspecified critical information that is then relayed to the Doolittle bombers that bombed Tokyo.

1180730,"I never had issues with Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" besides some minor ones with the silly dad-made-him story and the goofy looking flashbacks that seem to belong in an Oliver Stone film. More-or-less though, I liked it.The one problem, no sequel. After all, the point of the ""origin"" film is to set up at least two sequels, so you accept the slow pacing and the emphasis on how and why knowing that the set-up will pay off in the second film. But, what if there's not a second film?Now the ""Hulk"" is ""Incredible"" and they're correct, I don't quite believe it. I've read that Norton envisioned a longer, more emotionally complex film and the studios, in typical studio fashion, slashed and burned it. So what is left?While the new Hulk still looks a little too waxy on the skin to be alive (why is it only George Lucas can make completely CGI characters that truly blend?) his emotions come through better thanks to Norton acting out all the scenes for the animators (including a new, hi-def 3-D motion capture for facial expressions) and the result is a more engrossing Hulk character. Unfortunately he has little to do.The film is a simple, long chase. The only twist is that the person doing the chasing is an aging commando who wants a ""gamma"" induced boost, which he eventually OD's on and becomes a monster. The result is the obligatory clash of the titans, a destroyed NY city and a finale, almost. The films doesn't want to explain or tie up anything and that's a problem. Once again, there's no end, and no planed sequel.The film shows a third possible mutation / nemesis for Hulk, but only for a second and never returns. Meanwhile the big, bad second hulk monster is not killed, and doesn't return to human form, and is simply unconscious when last we see it. So the movie is supposed to be about Bruce Banner finding a cure, he doesn't and the Hulk defeating the bad guy, he doesn't, and a love story, unresolved, and a chase thriller, that stops chasing, then stalls.The movie lacked the depth needed to carry such an open ending, and with no sequel in site (the movie made scarcely more than Ang Lees but was far more expensive) all that's left is a second origin film and no end in site.",N/A

825298,"I have mixed feelings on Iron Jawed Angels. One the one hand, it tells the story of a very important (and relevant) moment in American history--the movement for national women's suffrage.As a film, Iron Jawed Angels works. On first viewing it is very arresting (no pun intended) and involving. It is filled with great actresses and gets good turns from an aging Patrick Dempsey and a seemingly getting younger Bob Gunton (he sure didn't look this good a decade ago in The Shawshank Redemption).Like most movies of this genre, the historical accuracy is slain on the altar of story-telling. In a story like Ms. Paul's this is unneccessary and annoying. This story has more than enough to it to carry a movie without any ""improvements.""I can understand the poetic liscence with the voting at the end, but why must we make up a Senator and his wife to live this battle out in the microcosm of their family? It is tedious and steals the thunder of the history to have this man use his position to ""rescue"" these women.One person did make a big fan of me in this movie. That was Frances O'Connor. She steals this film as Lucy Burns. My wife likes all the Austen flicks and I actually brought home The Importance of Being Earnest, so I have had the pleasure of watching Ms. O'Connor's work before, but she is at the top of her game in this film.Unfortunately, on a second viewing of this film, she was one of very few things that held up twice. The soundtrack and cinematography that make the film grab you the first time around--to put it in a nice way--wear quickly.The soundtrack in particular will date itself horribly in the next decade (an aside: my brother once said the same thing about the humor in Disney's Alladin. I thought he was splitting hairs back then, but man, was he right.)So...now comes recommendation time: Iron Jawed Angels is a visually stunning and historically important movie. However, the visuals and the music get old fast and the history is, if not suspect, juiced up a bit.Watch the movie and make up your own mind.

The T.V. series stuck far more closely to the plots of the books and the style of the books than did the MGM films.  And I know that, although they became great friends, Agatha Christie detested the films and thought Rutherford totally wrong for the part.Nevertheless, Margaret Rutherford had such charm and was clearly such an eccentric (as well as being an excellent character actress,) that I far prefer the generally maligned film series.  To top it off, Ron Goodwin's soundtracks were terrific.  It would be nice to see them on CD.  (Fat chance.)By all means, perpetuate the series via DVD, but PLEASE, MGM or Ted Turner or whoever currently holds the rights, issue the Rutherford films on DVD as well.The less said the better, however, about MGM's ill-conceived, ill-fated attempt to launch an Hercule Poirot franchise with Tony Randall.  And I LIKE Tony Randall.  I loved him in The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao, which, through some uncharacteristic burst of good taste, IS on DVD and which should be purchased forthwith.  When they actually manage to put out a deserving film, it is our responsibility to support the effort by buying it.  The book (The Circus of Dr. Lao) is 20 times better than the movie and should still be in print.One more thing and then I will shut up.  If you are a Margaret Rutherford fan, I strongly reccommend Mouse on the Moon.  Granted, Peter Sellers is AWOL, but ya got yer Margaret, ya got yer Terry Thomas, yer Ron Moody, Bernard Cribbens, John Le Mesurier, etc.  Ya got yer Richard Lester directing.

896204,"Well I watched two horror movies last night. One was Darkness, and then the other was Boogeyman. Neither was exactly heart- stopping, but alas the Boogeyman was a heck of a lot better. Boogeyman at least you could understand the true essence of the plot a lot more clearly, the actors definitely were better, and the creature at the end of the film did freak me out for a second. I think this movie made it seem like the Boogeyman is universal, just a bad spirit, and forms into what you imagine it to look like which is what this man, the protagonist in the film, did. I won't spoil the movie but the Boogeyman looks like a few things in his room put together. That was an interesting idea. The whole point of this is that it was something different to watch than the occasional house plagued with mad spirits thing they overdo. This movie was different and not too bad in their difference so I give it a solid three stars. Although in some parts of the movie you could feel lost, in the next scene you usually pick the pieces up quickly. The ending was the best part to me when he finally after running around his house so many times faces the creature once and for all. The ending they first chose, the one they stick with at the end is the best one. The other one, the ending they didn't put in the movie but let you see in the menu, was downright ridiculous. Where was his childhood friend in the second ending? And did you see how he looked standing in the window? He looks like a cartoon colored in! He didn't even look realistic. Now maybe that's because they weren't planning to put it in so they just didn't put much effort into it, they just showed a rough sketch of the second ending. I don't know but the second ending I didn't like at all. Trust me, the first ending, the one they show in the movie, is the best.Overall the movie was all right. I didn't hate it, but I won't be racing to the stores to own it as well. It was good to watch once, but probably never again, unless on t.v. one night when there's nothing else on.",Boogeyman

The acting is superlative, the mood is compelling, and the iconic imagery is extremely rich.  Lili Taylor hardly ever speaks above a whisper, which irritated me to no end.  Christopher Walken's too-brief appearance the best part of the movie, a flooding ray of light into a dark world.

However, this DVD kind of leaves something to be desired.  The main problem is the set list that Travis plays; I don't know about everyone else, but I wanted to see him rockin' on that stage.  But he doesn't really start playing any rockin' songs until the last 3 or 4.  So almost the whole concert is the slower softer songs, which are good, but I just don't think it's a good idea to play that many in a row.  They kind of started to put me to sleep after awhile.Don't mean to sound negative, I was just hoping to hear Travis rock much more than he did on this DVD.",N/A
1572351,"Im always a little wary about these Hollywood films being toted and talked about by critics as though it were the coming of the Lord. So I wasn't disappointed by this film because I had low expectations to begin with. Bradly Cooper is one of my favorite actors. I loved his last film, the one that is like a splice between Total Recall and Inception. Jennifer Lawrence, however, I am not crazy about. I didn't find her role in Winter's Bone to be all THAT. It was an ok film. Not shocking, enthralling or mesmorizing at all to me. Obvious, however, yes. She was good in the Hunger Games, but I think its true what they say, &#34;You're only as good as the actor in front of you.&#34; And she had a lot of actors in front of her that day. I know, you could say the same about her role up against Bradly, and you may be right. Sometimes he isn't that great either. But this isn't one of those times.In this role Cooper is just being released from a mental hospital after the nervous breakdown he suffered due to the discovery of his wife's infidelity with one of Cooper's co-workers. On the day of his release, Cooper decides he is going to get his wife back and make things right again by being positive, truthful and compassionate to the needs of others, as he was none of these things in his marriage before the breakdown. He meets Lawrence's character at the dinner party of a longtime friend, whose wife decides to tempt fate by trying to set up her sister (Lawrence) whom is grieving the loss of her husband with Cooper. The dinner is a disaster, both Lawrence and Cooper spend the evening discussing which medications they have been taking. An awkward moment arrives and Cooper has to excuse himself. Lawrence follows in pursuit, hits on Cooper, is denied, slaps him and then exits. It was funny but I also felt their tension, confusion and awkwardness. I have had moments like this. I am bipolar and recently experienced something similar at a dinner party. I hate dinner parties. I hate parties.The problem with this movie is that I thought that was the best part of it. After that, it just tries too hard. Cooper, I thought did a good job though in conveying the hardships of an mental illness when involving relationships. The scene in the attic bedroom when he comes unhinged and the cops are called was meant to be funny Im sure, but to me, it was real. And it was frightening. I've been there. So props to Cooper for a job well done.",Silver Linings Playbook

648772,"The first half of the movie is well done. The characters are well developed and the imagery is extraordinary. My only problem with this part of the movie is that there are too many songs crammed into it. You know that Mumble is going to be different, and when he does arrive on the Earth, the film does a grand job in making the other penguins exclude him for his lack of singing skill, and we quickly feel sorry for the young Mumble, who is thrust into a nasty world straight from birth. The start of the film is very touching, but lacks on the comedy and general interest, and therefore, the film could not have continued in that way forever. And it quickly changed - with the film being best having Mumble as a teenager. He then realizes that people are sick of his uniqueness now and that he is making the others feel humiliated, and that he could well be on his way to an early death.The film started to have more comedy from this point on - thank God for the Latino penguins. If it wasn't for them, the film could hardly even be called a comedy. Though it is meant to be touching, some of the action is extremely high-octane - when the penguins slide down cliffs into the sea, it makes for an overwhelming experience on the silver screen, and it may even thrill you. Though this film tries to be a masterpiece with its important message and generally effective characters and script, it is the animation that makes it brilliant - it is easily one of the best I have seen this year. It is all beautiful, and it truly raises the bar for animation in the future. The film is full of star-studded voice talents, from the youthful Elijah Wood to the irresistibly comedic Robin Williams, who entertains the audience with a feast of accidents and sessions of improvisation.Happy Feet isn't exactly a monumental film and probably won't have any effect on the environmental problems we suffer now, but the animation and story is good. Children will enjoy the clever animation and fun music. The story is a bit too detailed for younger children but the older members of the family will follow it. The movie is longer than what most children will sit through but the love story is endearing and the adventure is thrilling. If you liked March of the Penguin's, you'll love this movie. Even if you didn't like March of the Penguin's, Happy Feet still offers plenty to enjoy.",N/A
255021,"Like most folks, I had very high hopes for this film, definitely after the loosely connected 3-movie story arc preceeding it.  This movie didn't have the punch nor leave the audience with the typical satisfactory feeling afterwards.  I despised the use of an otherwise talented and beloved supporting cast for comical relief.  Instead of allowing the secondary characters a real chance to run, it resorted to sight gags and pretty much made them look like buffoons, and Shatner clearly didn't rectify the more-embarrassing moments.  However, that being said, the film show several wonderful moments..:1) LOVED the campfire scenes both at the beginning and end, effectively bracketing the film's story in a poignant way.  Why couldn't you have had moments like these for the secondary characters??? ~ They are seasoned ACTORS for heaven's sake..!  After how many movies and episodes, not only are they relegated to remain as secondaries, but treated with even less respectful screentime. Again, warm moments you WISHED they did more on the big screen ~ Taking time out to EXPLORE these characters and what makes them tick together, after all these voyages.  Without families, who have they really become..?2) Loved the horseback and wilderness scene's overall.  Gave the normally 'sterile' starship crew a more beneficial and agreeable backdrop to work against.3) Despite the lack of good effects, the Kirk/Spock interplay at the end was excellent ('Spock, not in front of the Klingons...').  It helps to make up for the heavy-handed 'I-need-my-pain' message you had to slog through.The Sybok character was entirely miscast and misdirected..  Who would believe he would be a Vulcan, even Spock's half-brother, raised by Surak...?  Terribly chemistry between him and the stars.  Granted he was no Khan, but a more cerebral and reserved, less jovial approach would have made for better and conflict with depth.  Instead we're treated to some painfully embarrassing exchanges.All in all, some excellent, warm screen moments found nowhere else in this franchise, but try not to wear out your fast-forward button.",N/A
1631345,"The first thing you'll begin to notice is the acting, It ranges from way over the top to just plain bad. There are really no redeeming characters other than the lead, most of the time you'll be begging to see the characters killed quickly. The movie is also very dark, now I don't mean tonally or the humor, I mean there were times I was staring at a black screen wondering what was happening. One thing I do give them credit for is not prolonging the action like most horror movies that wait 45 mins before anything of merit begins. The gore wasn't anything to brag about, it wasn't over the top but nothing really memorable either, except the &#34;blender scene&#34;. I'm sure the masks were meant to be clever, the hunted becoming the hunters, but on screen they look like something you'd buy at walmart for a kids Halloween party. The twist was nice it wasn't forced in and the end it was slid in midway with really no foreshadowing which is rare these days.

Watch the original first; otherwise, you may be distracted and decide to bypass this classic. May I recommend the Millenium edition?

555433,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child. I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.Having said that, I am unhappy with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and implying that this will make babies smarter!! These videos may be fun for older kids, but tv/videos are generally are NOT good for babies' brains!After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%, and 3) consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems. Interestingly, there is even some odds increase for bullying later on, for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2 and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2. Of course, I realize that this is probably not realistic for most people. There are studies that recommend preferably sitting with your child and watching t.v. together rather than just propping them in front of the tv by themselves, to make the experience more enriching and interactive (within limits of course - I doubt too much for babies and not more than the 2 hours per day recommended). But I wanted to put this information out so that other parents and caregivers could make better informed parenting decisions. Maybe it will encourage some to limit television usage for babies and children and look for other outlets when possible.For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time! Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance. Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",N/A
718344,"I wondered why this film was so lacking in any sort of reputation (Victory was filmed in 1993 and barely released in Asia in 1999). Not any more. The film really doesn't work, either as a spiritual morality play, as an adventure film or as a love epic. Nothing really clicks or compels. Production values are a notch above but still lacking in force and uninvigorating. It has relatively stable, but bland acting, a great story on paper, nice cinematography, and is marked by a prevalent cast, and still it is lacking brilliance or luster more than 15 years after its release.Victory (1995). Joseph Conrad wrote a fascinating book in Victory in 1915. It is a tale of human alienation that is then followed by a quest for love. I can wholeheartedly concur with that.Where the picture fails is in the two central performances, Axel Heyst (Willem Dafoe) and Alma (Irene Jacob). I felt that the central issue of the movie was not clarified strongly enough, so that the story weakened toward the climax instead of growing stronger. Two great actors and a script with some sharp alteration could have been a very penetrating movie.",Victory

879175,"I found this 1967 war film watchable, but nothing else. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.This film describes the fight for a large island during Pacific War and follows the tribulations of one company of USMC and their Japanese adversaries. The place of action is never named, we just know that the beach on which this one company lands is code named ""Red"". The island is however very large and as we know also that the initial stage of Bougainville Campaign (November-December 1943) is already over, the battle described here could be that of Saipan (June-July 1944) or Guam (July-August 1944).The film begins with the landing itself, which is opposed immediately on the beaches and costs Americans some casualties - but is nowhere near as hellish as the legendary slaughters on Tarawa or on Omaha Beach. Some reviewers claimed that this film inspired the initial sequences from ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it is unlikely - the intensity of the landing fight in ""Beach Red"" is far, far lesser than in Spielberg's master-piece.After the initial battle the Marines move inland, meeting first an improvised line of defense with machine gun nests and then a more substantial obstacle, with pillboxes made in concrete (like on Saipan). That battle is tougher and American tanks get involved - and then we enter the jungle, with all its deadly attractions...Cornel Wilde, who directed this film, was inspired by a novella published under the same title in 1945 by a veteran of Pacific War, but this being the Vietnam War era he changed the general tone in order to turn his film into an anti-war manifesto - and that didn't do this movie any good. Elements of rather crude and simplistic psychological analysis were added in form of soldier's reminiscences of their families at home, like in the much earlier, lavishly budgeted and stars-stiffed ""Halls of Montezuma"" - and exactly like in this former film, here they are more ridiculous than anything else...Cornel Wilde plays also here the main role of captain MacDonald, the commanding officer of the whole company - but honestly, a great actor he was not and I found his performance rather weak and as the result his character was not very credible. I already had the occasion to notice the same thing in other Wilde's film, ""Constantin and the Cross""... Other actors were unknown to me, but they did better, with especially Rip Torn playing very well a tough USMC NCO, Sergeant Honeywell.There is a lot of fighting in this film and most of those fighting scenes were good, with the initial landing and the fight agains pillboxes being the best. This film was turned on Philippines and local army gave considerable help, including some M-41 Walker Bulldogs light tanks, which albeit posterior to WWII can to some extent pretend to be long-gunned versions of M-4 Shermans...On another hand the portrayal of the Japanese was rather substandard. In an attempt to show the preparation for a ""banzai"" charge Wilde mustered hundreds of Philippino soldiers - but they all wear old American uniforms and M1903 Springfield rifles and as result those scenes are not very credible... Also, Wilde decided against subtitling in English what Japanese are saying and therefore had to ask the ""officers"" to gesticulate a lot so the viewer can understand what is it that they mean - the final result is rather pathetic and weird as the Japanese in this film use their hands to communicate a little like cavemen in ""Quest for Fire""...The portrayal of Pacific War and soldiers who wage it are in this film considerably influenced by the anti-war Vietnam-era ideology - and that anachronism hurts this film a lot, mostly by eliminating all kind of humour. There are only two very short scenes in which any humour is present - the rest of the film is mostly fighting and preaching about how bad it is to fight...Only one scene in this film was really great and moved me a lot - it shows two critically wounded soldiers, one Japanese and one American. They fell very close one to another, there is nobody else alive around and they both are aware that they are dying... That was a really good one.But some good fighting and a couple of other nice scenes nonobstant, this is ultimately a rather average film. Watchable, but nothing more.",N/A

821515,"This film is 'inspired' by the real life story of Jackie Kallen, the first sucessful female boxing manager (herself appearing as one sports reporter -- see the last one in the press conference).  Jackie is played by Meg Ryan who could be really feeling like 'against the ropes' because of these recent flops, but to do her justice, the film, or her performance itself, is not as bad as some people say.  The problem lies somewhere else -- the by-the-numbers script.OK, but the story per se is intriguing.  Jackie Kallen is doing thankless jobs like serving coffee for her insulting boss in the male-dominating world.  Provoked by another insulting promoter played by Tony Shalhaub, Jackie accepts his challenge, and takes a street-wise boy Omar Epps under her wing, to make him new champion.  She also enlists a help from the retired trainer Charles S Dutton (who also is the director of the film).Meg Ryan, often dressed in colorful and sexy clothes, and doing lower and deeper voice than she usually is, is clearly trying to look and sound like Jackie, with aggressive and foul-mouthed attitudes.  That works at first, but soon it gets obvious that she is acting ... not bad acting in itself, but still acting, or I should say, faking.  In her good films in the past (even the brief scenes in 'Top Gun') she was not faking, being always very natural.  Even that fake orgasm in 'When Harry Met Sally...' was not a fake.The major defect of 'Against the Ropes' is this -- it doesn't  look real at all.  Whatever the truths about Jackie Kallen story, the present story is made with old formulas -- initial humiliation, small success, ego-tripping act, hero/heroine's regret, then final showdown -- all of them give us the impression that the film is white-washed.  And this story is told too slowly.With Omar Epps whose biceps convince us of the character he is playing, and the long-awaited final moment which succeeds in creating the excitement of the boxing, 'Against the Ropes' ends with a great conclusion.  I wish the process coming there were constructed with some originality, or tighter direction.",Against the Ropes
410898,"It's hard to believe I never saw this as a kid. I saw just about every horror/sci-fi movie ever put on TV back then.......somehow I missed this one. I watched this film on a HD channel and it probably looked better than it ever has. I am aware of the book 'I Am Legend' which this and 'The Omega Man' were taken from but, I have never read it. I know this film follows the book closer than 'The Omega Man' but, I think that film edges this one out. The biggest problem with this film is the Vampire/Zombies are so slow and weak they pose no threat to anyone. In one scene Price is covered with these creatures and he pushes them off of himself like they were a bunch of blankets. I know, I know, in the old days ""zombies were slow"" but, in this film it is truly ridiculous and hurts the overall tension.  Another problem is Price is held up in his house which couldn't keep a gaggle of geese out let alone a horde of zombies who's only motivation is to kill him! ....all they would have to do is drop a match and this little chicken coup would have been a blaze. On the plus side, Price is terrific as usual and the film does have some atmosphere. I don't know how the DVD transfer is on this edition but, I have this film on another release with 'Panic In The Year Zero' and the transfer in very good.

1195516,"Well, I thought I might, but as the credits rolled on the first official summer film of '09, I realized I really didn't.  The way the origin was set up or rather alluded to in the previous X-Men installments was far more interesting then this film's blow by blow of the specific events that created the Logan we all know and love.  Sure, I used to read X-Men comics as a middle schooler so I already knew how Wolverine became Wolverine, but I never realized how much  the mystery of Wolverine was more entertaining without the details until I saw this film.No plot synopsis...there's not much plot to this film anyway.The plot to this current Marvel film is very small and uninspired.  The majority of the film is made up of the relationships or rather the meloncholy melodrama Wolverine has with his half brother, his wife, and General Stryker.  The plot doesn't kick in until about the forty minute mark.  Honestly, once the plot wheels get greased and rolling the film becomes less and less involving.  Even the action sequences were ho-hum.  Which is surprising, because so much dark conflict is built into them they should have severe impact similar to that of The Dark Knight, but they just ring hollow and routine.  I really, for the life of me, can't pull a single memorable image from any of the pyrotechnics involved in this film's story.  Considering that where the majority of the budget goes on these films, that's not a good thing.The acting is all fine.  Liev Shrieber brings an adequetely menacing presence as Wolverine's half brother Victor.  How we're supposed to believe that this well-spoken and sadistic maniac turns into the lumbering oaf that was Sabertooth in X-Men part one maybe the next film's major mystery.  Ryan Reynolds shows up briefly to play the character of Wade.  It's so brief that when he(or rather a stuntman under heavy prosthetics) returns in the finale you have to take a few seconds to realise it's him, or at least listen very closely to some dubbed dialogue to further drive the point home.  Which is another problem.  The whole film sets up this major conflict between Logan and Victor and then drops it in favor of a mega showdown with Deadpool.  A character whose creation is rushed into the narrative at the last hour, and holds no emotional ties to Wolverine and ends up being a big, but hollow, special effects light show.  Bummer.  With all the pathos this film contains the ending really could've sealed the deal for this film.Marvel now oversees the productions of all its characters' film adaptions.  Sometimes this is a good thing(Iron-Man), sometimes not so much(The Incredible Hulk).  Did we really need to be introduced to Deadpool, Gambit and Cyclops in this film?  Nope!  Sure, the fanboys had joygasms in unisen when they showed up, but the rest of us who put their comics away years ago, got nothing out of it but a slight crinkle in the upper left side of the cheek.  The actor who plays Gambi, can't think of his name, does an admirable job of hinting at the type of character he may be or become in future installments.  Nothing outrageously speical, but that has more to do with the writing and less to do with the acting.  He's adequetly charming for the part.  We also get some scraps in the form of other Marvel characters, none of us average Joes give a crap about like The Blob, The Wraith and Silverfox and others....Hugh Jackman was born to play this role.  Yes, fanboys will go on and on about how he's too tall and not squat like a wolverine(lol), but he embodies the pathos and physicality and strength of character I remember from my comic years.  I want more Jackman Wolverine but I want a better written film to go with it.The bottom line is, the film is passable or better yet servicable fluff fair.  You won't remember much about it after its over and it's about equal to the first X-Men film, but not quite up to par with the second or third film, or other Marvel Universe films released.  It's a good companion piece with Ghost Rider and The Incredible Hulk, good enough but nothing special.PS: Is anyone else out there sad that the first major films of the summer are sequels(Terminator:Salvation), re-boots AKA remakes(Star Trek) and spin-offs(Wolverine)?  It's starting to depress me.

Many of the characters in the first two Police Story movies are featured in Supercop, although the film feels much more Americanized than the prior films. The quote on the cover says that this movie is ""non-stop action"", I'll save you the suspense by letting you know that the action does indeed stop.There aren't quite as many stunts in this film as there was in the first two and the fight scenes are more few and far between as well. What we did get to see in this one that we didn't get in the first two however, is a pretty good shootout scene that actually showed Chan firing a gun and taking out a few baddies (which hadn't happened before in the series).Another change was the addition of Michelle Yeoh to help distribute more of the fight scenes among her and Chan. The final scene incorporates pretty unbelievable stunts including a NO CG scene of Jackie hanging from a ladder of a helicopter.",N/A

I felt that there were some hilarious sketches but a lot of dull and uninteresting ones. ALL OF THE SKETCHES IN THE OTHER 3 BEST OF ROCK! But, in this one, only certain ones do. I still recommend buying it because you can't just buy a couple of them.In my opinion, the coffee talk, and Wayne's World ones weren't funny at all. But, there were some that I enjoyed. I don't know all of their specific names but here are my favorites:- The british toothpaste- Mike Myers and Nicole Kidman in a park, with Myers wearing a helmet and a harness (Hilarious!!!!!)- Crazy Japanese show with Chris Farley and Alec Baldwin- Donny's awful revelations (Hilarious)- Sprockets with DieterThose are the only ones that I liked but they are worth buying the DVD because they're hilarious and memorable. Even though not all of them are funny, 5 of them are. And that's worth the buy. Some good laughs. But if you had to choose between best of Chris Farley, Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler and Mike Myers, this is how I rank them.1. Chris Farley- all of them are hilarious! Matt Foley rocks!2. Will Ferrell- All of them are hialrious! More cowbell! Roxbury Guys! Harry Carrey!3. Adam Sandler- Most of them are hilarious! Some get old after a while! Opera Man! Canteen Boy!4.

1218498,"Donkey Punch is a taut little Brit-shocker that succeeds in many aspects, but fails in a couple of important ones. The main problem lies with the characters. The guys are callous and contemptible and the girls more than a little stupid. Although there are signs that the writers realised this, and therefore tried to make a couple of the characters more sympathetic, there's no one here that the viewer can really empathise with and as a result the brutality (and there's plenty of it) is diffused in its effect. And, while the viewer's allegiance is challenged from time to time, its hard to care too much about who survives and who doesn't. It's also a little slow in delivering the mayhem. Once it starts, however, the gears shift and it becomes an efficient, and gory, descent into chaos.",Donkey Punch Rated
274563,"A cute, polished film. But why did those Messerschmitts keep attacking in pairs-- to make themselves easier targets? Or did the Luftwaffe have only two left by May of 1943?I kept waiting to see scenes of what the bombs were doing when they hit the ground-- killing thousands real people down there-- mostly children and women. Of course it is difficult to hit a target from 10,000 feet. Those bombs aimed at that factory were just as likely to land next door on the school or the hospital. (One problem the German intelligence had with the British bombing, and the Brits bombed more than we did, was figuring out what the target city was-- not which part of the city was the target-- but which city was the target.) And of course many civilians were living in the factories, since we had already bombed them out of their homes. But maybe if we kill the civilians, they will just give up and call it quits.Cute film; ""our"" men were brave, but do read the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, 1946, which stated that German industrial production increased greatly during the bombing.",N/A
703992,"""Dinotopia"", based on the best selling series of books, sounded compelling on paper. People crash land in a country where humans and dinosaurs live together in peace&harmony.; It's an interesting series, with some potentially good ideas, with a pre-Prison Break Wentworth Miller and David Thewlis as a surprisingly sympathetic villain.In ""Dinotopia"", Miller and Tyron Leitso star as a pair of half-brothers who crash land in Dinotopia. (To make this movie family-friendly, they describe their late father as ""socially active"") They are greeted by the presiding matriarch, Alice Krige. Since they are in a worker's paradise, they can't choose their own jobs. She also has them listening to dinosaurs pound their feet, getting them into polytheistic/pantheistic meditation. Furthermore, the half-brothers must abide by Dinotopia's laws. They must be vegetarian-and the kicker- they can't fight in self-defense if carnivorous dinosaurs attack. In the meantime, the half-brothers end up smitten with the mayor of Waterfall City's daughter. (In a not-so-family friendly twist, she skinny dips with one of them,but nothing results from the love triangle) They also encounter the free-thinking villain, David Thewlis. He wants the people of Dinotopia to have freedom of thought and freedom of motion,as well as the freedom to defend themselves- but he's stigmatized.The sunstones that are defending Dinotopia from carnivorous dinosaurs are failing. The half-brothers embark on a quest to restore them. As for the love triangle, it's left unresolved.""Dinotopia"" has some good special effects and great acting. Krige is at once menacing and maternal as Dinotopia's leader. She's the organic, vegetarian Borg Queen. The script is turgid. There are aspects problematic for youngsters. ""Dinotopia"" isn't utopia.

642046,"First, there is the contrived thriller plot, which drags on way too long, lacking in the energy it takes to manage the required twist at the end. Second, Melissa George (who reminds me of the young Sharon Stone) and Jennifer Aniston should have traded parts. The sultry George would have been much better as the adulterous Lucinda (what a great name), while Aniston, who really does better in the girl-next-door parts, was custom-made for Charles' wife Deanna. I understand that Aniston has more star power and probably wanted the bad-girl role as a stretch, but someone should have warned her off it.As it stands, Aniston just cannot be brought to deliver in her flirtatious part with any believability, a problem that undermines the film's very premises. She seems unable to decide whether to play the part with Hepburn-like wit or Taylor-like seething sexual steam (which unfortunately she does not possess). Of course, the script doesn't give her much guidance; her woodenly delivered ""I think I want to f*** you"" is a case in point. How was she supposed to say this line? It's anyone's guess. Also, it is just very hard to believe that the madly handsome Clive Owen would risk everything for Lucinda, especially when he has the smoldering Deanna waiting at home. Owen as Charles brings some power and intelligence to the task, but he is just not given enough to work with, and he does a pretty poor job of tamping down his irrepressible British accent.The film is mildly entertaining, and just a little scary.

1034243,"Bloody Ties (Ho Choi, 2005)Fun little movie, if nothing original; the mismatched-cop storyline attached to the rise and fall of drug lords in South Korea that revolved around influxes of IMF money in the nineties. Except in this case one of the mismatched cops is a small-time pusher. If you're a fan of action comedies, this should be right up your alley.Sangdo (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance's Seung-beom Ryu) is a street dealer who specializes in crystal meth. He's also been a snitch for the last five years, working for scruffy police lieutenant Do (Black House's Jeong-min Hwang). Things are going along just fine until the movements of the IMF and World Bank depress the drug culture in Pusan, giving rise to a gung-ho district attorney who's bent on putting as many drug dealers behind bars as possible. This includes Sangdo, who goes down for eight months. The money moves again while he's in the slammer, though, and a new druglord takes over his territory: the sadistic Jangcheol (The Divine Weapon's Do-gyung Lee). Do, in disgrace, wants to bring Jangcheol down. Sangdo wants his territory back. Since the two already know each other pretty well, why not team up and try to bring the guy down?It's brainless, it's got cardboard characters, way too many things blow up, and if you like this sort of thing, you'll love every minute of it. I thought it was a little on the shallow side; Jangcheol is just too evil, while Sangdo is too dealer-with-a-heart-of-gold, but Choi (who also co-wrote the screenplay) does throw some nice twists in now and again (did I mention the DA is too slimy for words?) and Hyun-jae Oh, in his first cinematography job, does a competent enough job to hold the eye's interest.

608345,"When I first saw Daredevil months ago in theaters, I bashed it as much as I could.  The idea of taking such a great comic character and trying to package it for global appeal just really grated my nerves.  However, after watching it for a second time, I have come to grown a bit of a liking for it.  Ben Affleck isn't bad at all as Matt Murdock who is lawyer by day and Daredevil by night.  Jennifer Garner is nicely cast as Elektra, and Colin Farrell nearly steals the entire film as Bullseye.  Director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson is a self admitted fan of the Daredevil comic (as is star Affleck) and it shows; the showdown between Elektra and Bullseye is almost directly taken from the classic issue of Daredevil #181, plus Marvel comics trivia knowledge is peppered all throughout the film, plus cameos from Marvel icon Stan Lee, writer Kevin Smith (yes, it's Silent Bob himself who goes by the name Jack Kirby in the film, named after another Daredevil alumnus), and the man who forever re-defined the comic series (and whose run on the series the film is seemingly mostly based from) Frank Miller.  While Daredevil does have it's share of good qualities, the film seems to have an uneven flow sometimes, Michael Clarke Duncan is miscast as the Kingpin (and no, it's not because he's black), the computer generated visual effects seem half heartedly put together, and the way the film ends just opens the door for a sequel and an Elektra spin off.  All that aside however, Daredevil didn't deserve all the bashing I gave it earlier, and longtime fans of the comic will appreciate most of the heart that went into the film, but might not like the complete package.  The DVD itself is nicely put together and the bonus featurettes featuring interviews with Stan Lee, Frank Miller, Brian Michael Bendis, Kevin Smith, and others is a must watch for long time Daredevil fans as well.",N/A

1346784,"Mario Monicelli's Casanova `70 was the kind of risqu&eacute; globe-trotting Italian sex comedy that found favour in the US at a time when the local censors seemed to allow foreign films more leeway than American ones but which now, despite its unapologetically smutty premise and some brief nudity, seems much more innocent and charming. Marcello Mastroianni is a NATO officer who finds that the sexual liberation of the 60s is sapping his libido to the point of impotence: with women not just easy prey but practically throwing themselves at men (provided you meet the minimum requirements, of course), the thrill of conquest leaves him unable to make love unless there's an element of danger to spice things up. His efforts to control his sexual demons are constantly doomed to failure, thanks to a succession of female lion tamers, jinxed prostitutes with a reputation for killing their clients and rich wives with homicidally jealous husbands until he finds himself in the dock with his various conquests (Virna Lisi, Michele Mercier and Marissa Mell among them) called as character witnesses...It's very much of its time - despite the title, it was made in 1965 - and it's hard to understand quite how it got a Best Screenplay Oscar nomination that year, but after a rather sluggish opening that's short of real laughs it does develop into something much funnier, and not just in the scenes with his female co-stars: two of the funniest scenes involve a cottage industry faking antiques and selling them by the pound like steak and cuckolded husband Marco Ferreri's attempt to get rid of his new rival. It's the kind of glamorous fluff that's increasingly enjoyable if you're in the right mood, with Mastroianni on particularly good form, and Kino's Region-free US Blu-ray offers a decent but not outstanding widescreen transfer (there's some slight digital noise in places, but nothing too distracting) in the original Italian with English subtitles.

But Hagman's most pathetic moment really game with this 1972 film that he directed.  ""Beware! The Blob"" (a.k.a. ""Son of the Blob"") is both a sequel to and a spoof of the 1958 Science Fiction Drive-In class ""The Blob,"" starring Steve McQueen.  He is long gone, and this time it is Robert Walker, Jr. (Charlie X on ""Star Trek"") who gets the responsibility of fight the big bad blob.  The plot is essentially the same as the original.  An unsuspecting guy brings back a sample of frozen goo from Alaska, where he was working on the pipeline.  The goo thaws, starts with a fly, works through a cat, and then an entire family.  The devouring is witnessed which means the heroine, Lisa (Gwynne Gilford) and her boyfriend, Bobby (Walker) spend time trying to convince the local sheriff that a giant red blob thing is eating people.  Meanwhile the giant red blob thing is eating everybody, which pretty much means a complete cross-section of Seventies stereotypes.Hagman must have called in a lot of I.O.U.'s because Burgess Meredith, Dick Van Patten, Godfrey Cambridge, and Shelly Berman all show up to be consumed by the red goo (watch for Hagman's cameo as a bum).  If there was ever an attempt to actually make a serious horror film here, then it must have been abandoned early on in the production.  Very few of the actors seem to be taking this thing seriously and Walker just does not have the heft to be the manly hero.  As a horror film ""Beware! The Blob"" is not scary and as a spoof it is not funny beyond the sophomoric level of the decidedly lame.  The death scenes are not particularly creative, although the special effects are really not that inept, but you get the feeling some of these victims are happily throwing themselves into the giant red blob thing.",Beware!

765066,"Perhaps I was jaded because I read the book and was taken in by the complexity of the characters that Stephen King created, or perhaps I was anticipating that the movie would be a linear depiction of the events portrayed in the novel, but I was truly disappointed in this film.The movie, which does contain elements of King's novel, starts off by introducing us to four men, each friends to the others and each possessing the gift of ESP.  On an annual camping trip in the woods of Northern Maine, the men stumble upon a lost hunter, who is infected with an alien &quot;byrum&quot; which gestates inside him before being born in a graphic and bloody moment in the first third of the film.At this point, the story begins to become disjointed.  In the original novel, the alien lifeform was a bacteria, using host bodies to survive by taking control of them, implanting their own minds in the mind of their hosts.  One of the key elements of the book was that the alien lifeform was symbiotic, and genuinely needed human life to function.In the movie, the aliens are a monstrous collage of teeth and oozing worm, though monstrous and hideous, also largely unbelievable, especially when this &quot;worm&quot; emerges time and again from its host body, standing far larger than the man it has been hiding in.  This, amongst the many other obvious flaws in this film detract from what could still be an intensely frightening story.To its credit, it has some beautiful special-effects, created for the film by Industrial Light and Magic, a veteran effects warehouse known for producing the effects on such films as Star Wars and Jurassic Park.  The acting, too, is not a complete wash.  Morgan Freeman, a veteran actor of the stage and screen, takes on the role of a soldier with a vandetta against these alien invaders.  His character is unbelievable, as is most the film, but Freeman delivers a great performance despite the limitations of this script.I do not want to discourage anyone from seeing this film...as films of this genre go, I have definitely seen much worse, but for those who have taken the time to read the original novel, be warned that this film is a far cry from the nightmare Stephen King painted for us when he released this novel, a complicated depection of friendships and relationships faced with a horrific possibility of alien invasion.  It should be viewed with that realization that Lawrence Kasdan (who directed this film) was admittedly looking to do &quot;an (special) effects&quot; film.

57448,"This well-meaning but flawed film purports to be about the life and times of Bruce Lee, the intense, talented actor and martial artist who died tragically all too young.  There is dispute over the biographical truth of the film, which is really neither here nor there, as the film seems far less interested in delving into Lee's biography than it does walking a strange line between drama and melodrama.  Though he doesn't much resemble the real-life Bruce Lee, star Jason Scott Lee tries hard to capture the actor's raw power and charisma, with mixed results.  He's best in the film's quieter moments, when the sincerity of his face gives the film much-needed grounding, and worst when his frenetic facial expressions and frequent shouting border on camp.  But this probably isn't Lee's fault, as the film itself drifts in and out of wanting to be taken seriously and wanting to be a pseudo-chopsocky matinee, all to an often-syrupy music score.  Co-star Lauren Holly is believable as Lee's caucasian wife, who struggles with him against racism that comes from so many in society--even her own mother.  It is here that the film works best, illustrating the humiliation and degradation of anti-Asian racism that Lee, who simply wants to be recognized as the American he is, endures from fellow Americans, even after achieving his fame.  A particularly clever--and dead-on accurate--scene reveals the isolation and thoughtless prejudice that Asian Americans frequently face:  amidst a crowd of whites roaring with laughter, Lee quietly suffers Mickey Rooney's grotesque yellowface characterization in the critically-acclaimed ""Breakfast at Tiffany's.""  Had the film focused more on meaningful emotional pyrotechnics like these, rather than the frequent, goofy interplay between Lee and a symbolic Mongol warrior, it might have captured the essence of the man instead of his onscreen persona.  Like ""Boogie Nights,"" it would have risen above the obvious exploitive qualities of its subject matter.",Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story

Here, the two main characters are lackluster. VanCleef is Okay but he seems to be the same character as he was in ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.""

412838,"This movie was an effort by John Carpenter to make a series of movies under the name Halloween without the Michael Myers character (aside from when Halloween was playing on TV in the background). It was a total flop, and hence the series of movies never developed and the studio went on to make multiple movies with Myers that ranged from pretty good, to incredibly stupid without Carpenter's involvement.I think this movie was doomed as soon as they tried to put the Halloween label on it. By then the Michael Myers character was synonymous with Halloween and anything that did not have him in it was never going to be given a shot. Personally I think Carpenter should have just promoted it under his name and not given it the Halloween title (something even the people involved admit). It probably would have done better and the series would have probably produced more than one film.As a movie I thought it was good, but not great. Given when it was made the writing and special effects were kind of cheesy, but it definitely has that creepy factor that any good horror movie has. The storyline was definitely weird and will not appeal to everyone. It was basically a company making haunted Halloween masks that when worn when a particular commercial came on would kill the person wearing it. It also had killer androids that would do the bad guy's dirty work. While there are certainly better horror movies out there, if you are a fan of the genre, and are ok with an offbeat out there kind of story line and the lack of Michael Myers you may want to check this out.",Halloween 3 - Season of the Witch VHS

1220388,"One of the most depressing, unsettling and bleakest movies I have seen in a long time, 135 minutes long Import/Export 2007, written/directed by Ulrich Seidl is gloomy, dark, and disturbing film. It feels like a documentary, and the winter landscapes in both parts of Europe, Eastern (Ukraine) and Western (Vienna, Austria) look and feel equally un- inviting and mean. Who would think that beautiful out of the fairy tale Vienna could be shot so un-appealing but I guess the nursing places for the ill and old patients are not the most cheerful places anywhere in the world, and they only add to the overall feeling of pessimism, degradation, lack of hope or anything uplifting in the existence of two main characters who never met because their lives moved in the parallel directions, and every character they come across.Ulrich Seidl excels in giving Import/Export feel of a documentary and in showing how advanced the humans are in corrupting and humiliating one another. I think this film takes a prize for the amount of the un- sexy, most unpleasant and longest X-rated scenes ever filmed. I guess if sex is not accompanied with love, desire or at least, lust, it is very boring and uncomfortable to watch and makes a viewer guilty for the degradation they are forced to watch and makes them want to stop or fast-forward these scenes as fast as possible. If that what Ulrich Seidle intentions were - he succeeded fully. Let me put it this way - Import/Export is a well-made move. It made me think of the serious matters - for instance, how high is the price of freedom to look for and to find a better life, to support yourself and your family, to be able to go to any country you chose and to succeed there. I did not see a single false note in any performance given mostly by the non- professionals. Import/Export achieves what it was set to do but I would never watch it again.

313019,"Having read the fine literary version of the same title, I was very curious to see what Hollywood would do with it.  Not that I was optimistic.  The story is a about the tragic end of a free people, the Cheyenne.  Defeated and on promises that they would receive land and provisions, they were relegated to a desert in Oklahoma, where they starved and were victims of disease, dwindling away in the most sordid conditions.  Having waited for over a year, the remaining 300 or so decided the whites didn't live up to their side of the contract and left to return to their homelands in the Yellow Stone.  They had no provisions, very few weapons, and only about 60 braves.  So started a 240-some day trek that ended in death, murder, and long criminal trials, though they won the right to a reservation in Montana.  In the book, there is this sense of the meaningless death of a complex culture.  It is an absolutely awful story of a people trying to flee genocide and spiritual death by administrative oversight.The film begins with a splendidly tragic tone, as acted by the young Ricardo Montalbam, who plays a charismatic chief disgusted by the treatment of his tribe.  This is an unusual step for a major hollywood film, but the traditions of the genre soon betray the many qualities of the production.  There are several interesting military confrontations, with one character growing under the eye of the stern captain.  This is where the story diverges from history in increasingly ridiculous ways.  Set against the Cheyenne is a humanistic captain, who must do his duty but who regrets it more and more, empathizing with the Indians while courting a lovely Quaker woman who elects to travel with them as a nurse (both apocryphal, if memory serves).  Widmark is at his best here.  Unfortunately, the tone deteriorates terribly with a cameo by Jimmy Stewart, who plays a comical Wyatt Earp as he leads a Dodge City saloon crowd on a hunt for the Indians, complete with a portable bar and prostitutes.  It is funny, with a hooker running without her dress when the Indians fire on them, but completely destroys the mood.  There is a notable episode when a group of braves lead people wishing to surrender in winter, only to be imprisonned and told that they must march back to Oklahoma, which they refuse to do on pain of starvation and cold.  Karl Malden plays a stupidly wooden soldier who seeks to force them to submit, while Widmark opposes him and goes to meet the Secretary of the Interior, Edward G. Robinson.  They escape at the cost of many lives.  (In reality, they were captured and broke out.)  By the end, the film is overwhelmed by melodrama.  Widmark's romance advances, while Sal Mineo confronts Montalban over a woman.  It had lost me by this point, so that I wasn't even disappointed by the happy ending they grafted on to such an awful story.Nonetheless, there are interesting aspects to the film, particularly in view of the fact that it was made (in 1964) just before the 60s anti-authoritarian impulse became so commonplace.  Viewers expected heroes and unambiguous outcomes and that is what they got rather than tragedy and gritty realism.  There is a truly outstanding cast that held my attention until it degenerated into a kind of semi-serious shlock.  The documentary in my version, narrated by Stewart, also piles it on with pre-Vietnam optimism and no acknowledgment that there are problems on Indian reservations or even recognizing that the Cheyenne autumn was essentially the end of an ancient culture.  I would give this 3.5 stars and recommend it for film buffs but not for anyone interested in learning the history or simply a good cowboy-indian film:  too schmaltzy for the former, too slow and sad for the latter.  This story required more, much more, not only including tragedy, but also irony, cynicism, and an unflinching, even existential, gaze; it isn't here.  Contrast this with Little Big Man, which instilled a lifelong fascination with indigenous peoples in me, and you will see my point.  LBM was made just 6 years later, a true product of the wider perspctive that the 60s enabled.",N/A

437400,"""It wasn't a question of doing everything differently, although they changed the ending; it was mostly a matter of doing everything wrong. They said the lines but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong they could possibly do. That's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking. Because everything they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from it. And people assume that if I hated it then they'd changed the script...but it wasn't so much they changed it, they executed it in such a ghastly fashion they rendered it unwatchable."" - Joss Whedon on Alien: ResurrectionThis was Whedon's response to accusations that Jean Pierre-Jeunet deviated from the screenplay he had written. These accusations were brought forth by the fact that Whedon expressed his displeasure in the film. In reality he was upset with the fact that he had written the screenplay with a tongue in cheek tone, but in the end the director opted to play the film straight. The result became part of the inspiration for my favorite show from Whedon: Firefly. Needless to say that has gained more acclaim and a greater fan following than Alien: Resurrection.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), having died at the end of Alien3, has been cloned by the corporation 200 years after her death. She's become a blend of alien and human, the soldier that they have been looking for. In turn they have also created new aliens, but when they escape from their holding pin it is up to the alien hybrid Ripley to help a mercenary crew escape from the Auriga ship they are being held captive on.Honestly, I don't get all the hate for Alien: Resurrection. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a great movie but I did enjoy it more than Alien3 and people seem to enjoy that movie much more than this. That's something I've never been quite able to grasp. For me, anytime Ron Perlman is involved in a flick I stand up and take notice, and he does a great job at adding levity to the proceedings here. Sigourney Weaver also seems to be having more fun than she has the entire series as well. She's able to play around with the character she created in the first Alien and evolve, since she's a hybrid, into a somewhat ambiguous character.While Jean Pierre-Jeunet did not completely keep to Whedon's script he still seems to be having fun with the movie. For a guy who codirected flicks like Amelie and Delicatessen, he keeps something of that French tongue in cheek spirit. I think that we as Americans sometimes can't exactly see that for what it is. At the same time though, do we really want that from our Alien movies? Alien and Aliens were brilliant pieces of work that didn't rely on levity in their proceedings, but Alien3 was so dark that it might have required such levity. Either way I think this is still the last decent flick in the series.Looking back on the series I think Alien3 is the weakest link, unfortunately I seem to be in the minority. Alien3 had the benefit of being directed largely by future Oscar nominee David Fincher; whereas Alien: Resurrection was directed by Jean Pierre-Jeunet, who had not directed a flick alone or in English prior to this film (he required a translator on site in order to communicate with the cast). Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon, Perlman, Weaver, and Alien newbie Winona Ryder among a largely entertaining cast help make this film a lot more fun than people like to admit. I recommend this over Alien3, but then again I would recommend all of the Alien flicks to first time watchers. Even at its worst, it's better than most Science Fiction series.3.5/5Be sure to check out:Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!",Alien Resurrection VHS

190014,"This New Zealand film is directed with wild abandon by Peter Jackson, who would find fame and fortune with a later and better effort, the critically acclaimed ""Heavenly Creatures"", and with the spectalular, award winning, ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Of course, even the best directors have to start somewhere. This is a sort of campy, darkly comedic, horror film that suffers from an excess of gore that is extreme and over the top. Notwithstanding this, it has moments of actual promise that eventually simply succumb to the director's excesses.The story is a simple one and takes place in the nineteen fifties. In Sumatra,  there is a highly unusual creature called a Rat Monkey that looks exactly as it is named. When one is spirited out of the country, despite  the outrage of the local natives, it is the beginning of the end. Unbeknownst to its handlers, a Rat Monkey bite transmits a virus that makes a zombie out of  the bitten entity. Upon arrival in New Zealand, the Rat Monkey is placed in the local zoo.Meanwhile, a local mama's boy, Lionel (Timothy Balme), meets the luscious Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Penalver), whose ancient crone of a grandmother (Davina Whitehouse) had recently  predicted that Paquita would be meeting  the love of her life. The only problem is that in the Tarot cards her grandmother read, it appears that Paquita's erstwhile lover is surrounded by death.Paquita, sure that Lionel is the one, does everything possible to ensure that Lionel takes her on a date. Unfortunately, Lionel lives in a mansion with his rich, domineering Mum (Elizabeth Moody). So, when Paquita and Lionel go to the zoo on their first date, dear old Mum arranges to catch up with them at the zoo, only to find herself bitten by the Rat Monkey. Soon after, Mum  finds herself a member of undead.Lionel calls for Nurse McTavish (Brenda Kendall) to come and tend to Mum, as to him she appears to have fallen strangely ill.  After a run in with Mum's teeth, Nurse McTavish finds herself among the undead, as well. Initially, Lionel has the situation under control, keep the bodies of the undead tranquilized and tied up in the basement.When, however, his mother is finally declared officially dead and a funeral is arranged , his sleazy , lecherous Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) comes out of the woodwork, looking for a share of Lionel's inheritance. When he goes to the mansion in which Lionel lives, he discovers the undead in the basement. So, he blackmails Lionel. Uncle  Les promises not to notify the police that Lionel has seemingly dead bodies in the basement. In return, Lionel  promises to turn over his mother's mansion and fortune over to Les.Unfortunately, Les  then throws a big party at the mansion, while the undead are in the basement. When the undead get out, all hell breaks loose, as they start biting and eating  everyone, creating hordes of new undead, which Lionel and Paquita must battle in order to survive.There are some very funny moments in this campy, offbeat film. The problem is the gore is so over the top that it becomes tiresome. It is certainly not scary. There are some excellent performances by the cast. Elizabeth Moody is wonderful as Mum, and Ian Watkins is quite funny as  Lionel's Uncle Les.  Diana Penalver is excellent in the role of the winsome Paquita, and the rest of the supporting cast is more than adequate for the roles in this film, which consist mostly of letting oneself be torn asunder by the undead.This is a totally over the top film that has the makings of becoming a cult classic. It is worth a rental for those for whom too much gore is simply not enough.",Dead Alive

1343259,"WARNING:SPOILERS AHEAD!Firstly, I've not read the novel this movie is based on. So my comments are for this film only.Secondly, the most interesting about this picture is Noomi Rapace's engaging acting. She vividly played Lisbeth Salander who was a chain smoker, drinker and skillful computer hacker. What an attitude she had. She did not get mad, she always got even. There was more to her character but I would not reveal them here.Thirdly, the plot was complicated. It dealt with many problems such as police's power abuse, domestic violence, serial killing. These problems were depicted in many extremely disturbing scenes. They made me very angry seeing how much emotionally Lisbeth was suffering.  The plot also involves deep relationship between the  niece and her uncle. The uncle's love for his niece was strongly expressed from the beginning till the end. The last scene touched my heart.Fourthly, the most ridiculous aspect is this movie has at least 4 big logical holes that greatly erode my interest. If it had been a fantasy movie, I'd would have ignored its logic deficiency. However, it's a kind of detective and drama movie. So, logic is one of its foundations! I won't list all of the holes I found but one here. For example, after a member of Vanger family saved Mikael from being killed by the owner of the house he just broke in, he told his savior everything about his investigation. Consequently, he paid dearly later! Before that, the film had always shown most of the Vanger members including his savior just wanted him to go home. Why on earth, suddenly Mikael turned into a man with the brain of a junior high school student? Why many detective/investigative movies have the same problem? Because of this I gave this movie 3 stars.In short, it's worth watching once especially if you want something different from Hollywood stuff.",N/A
674254,"This movie is okay - more good than bad - but it has a couple of huge flaws.First, the attraction between Eli (Dan Bucatinsky) and Tom (Richard Ruccolo) is completely unbelievable. There's obviously no real chemistry between the two actors (since Ruccolo is straight), and they're not talented enough to conjure it up out of acting skill alone. Since that relationship is the heart of the movie, its total lack of believable passion is a very serious flaw. Better casting of either (especially Tom) or both roles could have solved it. (Ruccolo looks too much like Ren&eacute;e Zellweger to be sexy anyway, and his shaved chest is a big turn-off.)Second, when Tom, the self-proclaimed martini expert, makes one for Eli, he uses vodka. Now, I know there are idiots in the world who actually do make a drink with vodka which they call a martini, but that doesn't make it a martini. A martini is made with gin, not vodka. Using vodka to make a ""martini"" is like using Crisco to make ""butter"" cookies: you can call the result butter cookies, but that doesn't make them butter cookies.What this movie has going for it are a mostly entertaining and intelligent screenplay (only occasionally irritating and stupid - like the Gone with the Wind bit on the first date, and a few similar times when an only marginally entertaining joke is dragged out way too long; Tom blowing vermouth fumes into the ""martini"" is another clunker); a dynamite comic performance by snarky Adam Goldberg just being snarky Adam Goldberg; a solid performance by Sasha Alexander as the female glue that holds the three male flakes together; and a good enough performance by Bucatinsky to make Eli believable as a person if not as a lover - but even that is more Ruccolo's fault than his. Brief cameos by Doris Roberts and Lisa Kudrow are bonus treats.",All Over The Guy
4123,"I won't bother to get into details of the stories, since that is already well-covered by other reviews on this site.This two DVD set includes ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" and ""Lord Edgeware Dies"". The producers set these stories as taking place after previous episodes. This decision was probably made on account of how much older the actors look. While Poirot and Inspector Japp have aged gracefully, both Captain Hastings and Miss Lemon show their years.The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of Agatha Christie's most famous novels, but it translates poorly on the screen. It is impossible to go into details without giving away who the murderer is, but suffice it to say that the surprise of the novel is greatly diluted here. There is also a wistful sort of sadness that permeates the entire story, with none of the charm of the earlier episodes. There is also a feeling that the production was rushed, and that the actors feel uncomfortable in their roles.Lord Edgeware Dies is a much better production. All the old favorite characters are re-united here and some of the charm/humor missing in the first story is present here. There is also a greater sense of locale. This episode feels more populated and the variety of locations along with the complexity of the story helps keeps this moving along at an entertaining clip.If you have the opportunity to purchase the two DVDs seperately, definately choose Lord Edgeware Dies and forget about Murder of Roger Ackroyd.",N/A

588784,"For a three hour movie, this movie had remarkably little content. Althought biographical, it only covered a few years of his life, not even his complete boxing career. There were many unnecessary scenes that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. For example, there was about 20 minutes of Ali jogging (around two hours into the movie) in preparation for the famous &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; fight. During these 15 -20 minutes, the only dialouge is some Africans chanting something which translated to (I think) &quot;fear Ali.&quot; This scene has no point, and I think it was just put there because they wanted to make the movie longer. There were many other examples, but that one was the worst.Also, the movie was poorly directed during the boxing scenes. I often found myself wondering who was punching who. The camera angles were often poor. Also, some characters just materialized without introduction. For example, (I don't want to give away  too much) but Ali's second wife just comes out of nowhere. The audience is never told that he even got a divorce, let alone that he remarried. This happened a couple of times in the movie.On the positive side, Will Smith did an excellent job, as did most of the cast. Smith captured the arrogance, and hypocritical idealogy of Ali very well. Also, that Smith was actually made to look like Muhammed Ali is a miracle of film making.Overall, an OK movie marred by trying to be more epic than it was, and poor direction.",Ali

713327,"A short R-rated Japanese ""horror"" film about a deranged family that videotapes their crimes by director Takashi Miike.  The movie stars Kenichi Endo, Shungiku Uchida, Kazushi Watanabe, and Shoko Nakahara.  The film contains nudity (both male and female; though a particular lower region is blurry on the front for both the men and women; going by the comic books, the blurring/censoring might be required by law in Japan - though in the movie, that blurring does not always occur).DVD features: Contains the movie (in Japanese with English subtitles) plus some extras.  The special features include: a director's biography (very detailed); liner notes (very detailed); and trailers (four trailers: Samurai Fiction; Freeze Me; Visitor Q; and Fudoh).The movie opens with what looks like a prostitute and a ""John"" in a hotel room (appearances can be deceiving).  Both have cameras, and the jerky camera work appears to represent what the two cameras see, sometimes at an extreme close-up view (though the woman is the one most often in view).  Then the camera becomes mostly stationary and the ""action"" unfolds (though the action is somewhat blurry - the action is blurry, and a particular area of the male form is deliberately blurred; and the stationary position changes).  The movie starts out seeming to be just a somewhat boring interaction in a hotel room.And then it turns strange.  A man (call him father), the same man from the first scene, is hit over the head.  Then a new scene, set in a disturbing home where the son dominates the mother, and what's this?  Father has brought his ""friend"" that hit him on the head over to his apartment to meet his wife and son.  It would appear that father is a journalist that had been trying to make a little documentary about how the youth are fairing in Japan, but was attacked.  The attack was video-taped and shown on the air (not the earlier attack mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph).  The man became disgraced and now is ""on-break.""  Well, his new idea is to film his own family, and document bullying.  The bullied end up bullying others.I suppose it is interesting just trying to figure out what is going on, or what the movie is truly supposed to be about.  Though it isn't that hard to figure out after a while (but, do you are you correct?).  With this type of strange movie, it is difficult to determine how much to reveal, so I'll need to leave the review vague.  I will say that the people involved appear insane, and there appears to be a slight similarity to the film ""15 Seconds"" in that both include criminals video-taping their acts, though they are very different movies.The sick and disturbing movie contains violence (both of the bullying nature and of the sexual nature - women getting attacked), torture, whipping, drug use, death, dismemberment, necrophilia (and the dangers of said acts), and incest.  A strange disturbing little movie (though it can be strangely funny at least one time).  Hard to rate this type of movie, or know which category to place it.  Good music at least.  Due to the need to use the subtitles, and the strange nature of the film, it is hard to critic the acting, nor can proper crediting be given (most of the credits appear to be in Japanese; a list of the actors is given in English, but not matched up with any particular part).

Grace, (Shirley Jones), has the libido of a 20 year old and Bea, (Shirley Knight), is overmedicated to the point of bringing Terret's Syndrome-type humor to the mix.Alex, of course, does not want to admit that he lives with his grandmother, so he tells all of his friends/co-workers, including his sexy new boss, (Linda Cardellini), that ""three hot babes"" live with him.  But soon enough, the secret is revealed and the real fun begins.The real dilemma is presented though when a rival co-worker, J.P., (Joel Moore), with some serious identity issues is working against Alex to try and present a new and impressive video game idea that will increase his ego and make everyone else look like crap, as always.  But this year, Alex has a new plan up his sleeve that might make J.P. back down once and for all and look like the psycho he...well...already looks like...but worse!If you like stoner humor, karate-chopping chimps, men who talk like robots, pop culture references, drunken karaoke, unfortunate incidents with Lara Croft dolls and enough sexual innuendo to make the world go 'round, then you'll love ""Grandma's Boy"".  Also starring Jonah Hill, Kevin Nealon, Nick Swardson, David Spade and Rob Schneider.  You might recognize these people from their following credits:Jonah Hill--has appeared in such films as ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad""--a member of Judd Apatow's brat-pack.Joel Moore--he has been in everything lately from ""Dodgeball"" to Katy Perry's music video for ""Waking Up in Vegas"".Nick Swardson--a popular stand-up comedian with specials on Comedy Central.Kevin Nealon--SNL alum.  Also briefly appeared in ""The Wedding Singer"" as the banker Adam Sandler goes to for a loan.David Spade--another SNL alum.  You'd probably know him from the TV show, ""Just Shoot Me"" or the films ""Joe Dirt"", ""Black Sheep"" and ""Tommy Boy"".Rob Schneider--yet another SNL alum who has been in most of Sandler's body of work, except for a few films he branched out on his own with, including ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" and ""The Hot Chick"".",Grandma's Boy

947434,"Mainly based upon an American Journey's Tour (culminating into a couple of concerts in Houston and Cleveland) supporting the hit album ""Escape"" on 1981, you can find some other sessions within a 4 months effort at MTV, inside the present DVD live (dated 2005). But of course their main show- taken on November 6, 1981 and featuring the most famous line up with Neal Schon, Steve Perry, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory and Steve Smith- is not always on the most inspiring side of AOR rock. Nevertheless there are always their biggest hit singles...even though- apart from the passion and strong vocal interpretation as well by S. Perry- I'm a little bit disturbed when I listen to a kind of ""boogie rock"" entitled ""Line of fire"" and sometimes tired too, owing to their usual ballads, such as ""Lights"", ""Stay Awhile"", and ""Open Arms"".Anyway- fortunately- ""Mother/Father"" is one of the most ""convincing"" and heavier songs from ""Escape"", and above all it's not a commercial hit!! Then I like the guitar solo by N. Schon within ""Who's Crying Now"", this latter being a ballad in the opening section, but growing by means of the emotional feeling expressed in the guitar line of the following section...at the end I wait for ""Wheel In The Sky"", probably the best example regarding the style of the guitarist; nevertheless the easy melodic soloings by Neal have been often appreciated also in the pop hits. Moreover I like to mention the excellent production quality (if you consider the record dated 1981!!), with the support of MTV, performing a very good job here- as long as you find an additional song, ""The Party's Over"" , combined with the Escape TV Promo (this latter enriched by means of the interviews) , which all together make this product of ""AOR"" music quite an important event. In fact They were able to witness the most melodic moments, according to the typical mood of the early eighties, in the Golden Age of such an interesting American simple rock (however equal to Styx and Boston, just to mention a couple of bands with the same style within that period...).An interesting film for an easy melodic rock-I mean, from a shrewd ever-green band! You know that I prefer the effective prog music genre, in comparison to the world of prog related or AOR music but- talking about Journey- I recognize their importance inside the world of pop music... at the end- for me- it could be enough to think of giving it over an half star in the evaluation, at least!!","Journey - Live in Houston 1981, The Escape Tour"
489831,"The second video in the series, this VT ep didn't quite reach the quality that later videos would reach.  I imagine this is because the authors were still new at making movies.  The first half of the video, about the grapes of wrath, has no plot whatsoever and is merely a lesson.  It is not  presented in a very interesting way.  The second half, the gilligan's  island parody, was much more amusing and presented better music and a great  message in a fun way.  It still wasn't as good as the others, but it was  decent.

305920,"This tape comprises the first two episodes of the brilliant British series. Loosely based as science fiction due to its setting in the future, this is primarily a drama series based in fact, dealing with human rights  abuses that unhappily occur in our present. In an unspecified time  (although not too far in the future), Earth is run by a totalitarian  Federation - dissidents are murdered or sent to penal colonies and the  populace is drugged into a state of subservient apathy. Into this scenario  enters Roj Blake, a seemingly unassuming man. Blake is asked by a friend to  join a meeting of rebels; this he does, with fateful consequences. The  first episode, &quot;The Way Back&quot; is the best to authentically  capture the Orwellian atmosphere the series is based on. The sterile, white  corridors of the domed city; the ruthless and murderous black suited  security patrols; the psycho-manipulators - they all depict perfectly this  depressing possibility of the future. Blake's nightmarish journey as he  rediscovers his repressed past is harrowing - his mental breakdown,  complete with horrific and violent flashbacks, is a disturbing indicator of  what this regime is capable of. The second episode, &quot;Space Fall&quot;,  deals with the formation of the group that will become Blake's crew. Of  particular interest is the introduction of Kerr Avon, the cynical would-be  computer fraudster, who will become the series' most interesting character.  One of the down sides to &quot;Blake's 7&quot; is that the introduction is  very slow - it continues over the next two episodes. A casual viewer may be  put off by this, despite the importance of understanding the background and  motivation of the characters in the later stories. In short, essential for  the sake of continuity, but very heavygoing. But perserverance will reward  the new viewer.","Blake's 7, Vol. 01 - The Way Back / Space Fall VHS"

Nevertheless, this film never shies away from reminding us that Gibson's character is a chauvinist...it practically beats us over the head with this fact.  Yes, we get it!  Helen Hunt, on the other hand, seemed much more natural in her role, both thanks to her acting and the script...no fear of head injuries there.  We can see her as a smart, head-strong, successful ad executive and enjoy doing so.

172582,"American Icons have been under attack the last half-century or so, a process that was started by the Left, accelerated in the '60s by the counter-culture, and carried on in the 70s-today by Hollywood and television.  You name it, if it's an American Icon, it's been trashed ..... the church, the Pilgrims, Columbus, George Washington, sports heroes, American business, the American military, the police, the President, ""Dead White Males,"" etc etc.  All to cut out our beliefs, make us weak, make us ashamed of our heritage, and open us up to radical change.  BUT there was always the Cowboy.  The Cowboy, the strong, self-reliant, self-confident yet humble, physically and mentally tough Cowboy.  He faced down the elements, wild animals, Indian attacks, and outlaws; he rode horses all day, roped cattle, slept out in front of a fire, and shot guns when he had to.  Now THAT was an image that Americans could look upon and get some inspiration from.So of course, Hollywood had to go after the Cowboy and trash him in our minds.  Replace that image with something twisted.  OK, let's see, let's make him gay!  And two of them getting it on out in the wilderness!  Now, make this into a seemingly intelligent, compelling & artful movie, so the critics have less reason to put it down, and there it is ............ you've just shot down one of America's icons.  Anytime anyone brings up the Cowboy as an example of America's proud past and toughness, and some snide jerk will snicker, ""Oh yeah, just like Brokeback Mountain,"" and undercut the argument with sarcasm and derision.  SO that's what this movie is all about.  It's called Cultural Marxism.  Destroy America's cultural icons, and you can manipulate Americans.  (See my review of American Beauty for another example.)The filmmakers dropped two gay Greenwich Villiage guys into Wyoming and Texas, made them cowboys, and ran their little ""love"" story.  They COULD HAVE changed the characters and setting and kept a similar story, but no, they had to go for the jugular, and trash the image of the Cowboy.  Next thing you know, they'll make a movie about Patton and make him gay.  Or two gay Marines on Iwo Jima.  Whatever.As for the plot, the acting, the scenery, the story, the music, the directing, that's all secondary to this agenda.

I bought the regular edition on video as soon as I could, and  when I found out about the &quot;special edition&quot; I pounced on  it.Unfortunately, it's not a very &quot;special&quot; edition at all.  The original ending with Superheroes is a treat, but it's AFTER the closing  credits in a seperate section.  Why not put it where it was originally, so  you don't have to watch the end of the movie, fast forward, and watch the  end of the movie again?  Boneheaded move on 20th Century's part.The  other deleted scene, &quot;Once in Awhile,&quot; was deleted for obvious  reasons.  It's a great song, but there's only about 5 seconds of new  footage, and the rest is a montage of scenes from the rest of the movie.  If you've got any of the Rocky Horror CDs, you've already heard the song,  so it's no big thrill to have not-quite-matching visuals with it.If you  don't already own any video edition of Rocky Horror, this one's as good as  any.

Fonda and Bronson are both excellent as the play, with straight faces, an American colonel in Intelligence (Fonda) and a roughneck American Lieutenant (Bronson)-- ""Heyyy, wait a minute"" says Bronson, snapping his fingers in the film's second most memorable moment -- Telly Savalas, however, steals the show as ""Joe"" a black marketing tank commander.So, it's stupid, but the movie is FUN as it presents the Reader's Digest, Americanized version of a bloodless Battle -- that repeats every fabled anecdote of the battle, and boils them down to polished chestnuts.  To be fair, this movie was really intended (like How the West was Won) to showcase the new ""Cinerama"" dome and its big curved screen -- Imax before Imax.

565320,"Well, so here's another attempt at ""Dune;"" a book that's probably consider to be one of the best Sci-fi ever written - even without its sequels. So, why is it that with such great material in hand, the adaptions have fallen so short?David Lynch, who in my opinion, is a great director and visionaire, did his version of ""Dune"" in the 1980's; unfortunately it wasn't one of his best work (although I have heard that the real culprit might have been Dino De Laurentiis; the producer of the film, aka director of Flash Gordon). Lynch's ""Dune"" was a bit on the weird side (not surprising), and the entire film was difficult to comprehend for viewers who are not already familar with the story and its characters. Thankfully, Sci-Fi channel's ""Dune"" somewhat fixed this problem.Sci-Fi channel's version of ""Dune"" added dialogues and scenes to make the story more coherent to any newcomer. So, I think most people should be able to follow the progression. In fact, if you never read the book, you might even think these minseries are pretty good. The special effects are on par with what you would expect from a made-for-tv movie. The actors do a decent enough job, so nothing seems too cheesy. And since this version follows the original book fairly close, if you're a sci-fi fan, it should definitely be interesting.However, one problem does arise from these sands of ""Dune."" The casting. The casting sucked. I'm sorry, but William Hurt does not even remotely resemble Leto Atreides. Alec Newman doesn't look like Paul, and Thuir Hawat seems wrong (where are the wrinkles), so does Duncan Idaho, Dr. Yueh, etc. Some people might says this is not a big deal, but you know what?

79843,"Based on Michael Ondaatje's sweeping WWII novel, ""The English Patient"" is the story of a young Allied nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche) who finds herself alone in an abandoned Italian monastery and tending to a mysterious burn victim (Ralph Fiennes).  Like David Lean's Dr. Zhivago, this mystical and epic film is told through a series of flash backs integrated with a subplot that is supposedly taking place in the present. During the flash backs we learn of the tragic circumstances that have led to the current state of the stranger. Fiennes is Count Laszlo, an archaeologist - and assumed Nazi sympathizer - who is in love with Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). She, unfortunately, is married to the long suffering, dispassionate, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). The two are off gallivanting through the dessert in search of artifacts when the passionate relationship between the Count and Kate ignites. The resulting, all consuming, lust that overtakes these lovers is intricately balanced and compared to Hana's burgeoning romance with an East Indian soldier who defuses bombs, Lt. Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews). Willem Dafoe is brilliantly cast as Caravaggio - a man whose association with the allies (in a flash back) was exposed to the Nazis, the result being that Caravaggio had his thumbs brutally amputated with a switch blade. Caravaggio is determined to brutalize the man he believe is responsible for exposing his secret, the man he suspects is the burn victim lying helpless and dying in the monastery. Winner of nine Academy Awards ""The English Patient"" is a bittersweet love story between four people (two couples) who meet with untimely and destructive forces that ultimately alter the course of their lives forever.THE TRANSFER:This disc was previously released as a flipper from Miramax in a non-anamorphic and somewhat grainy transfer. The previous disc suffered greatly from the intrusion of pixelization and edge enhancement. It also lacked anything in the way of extras. For the most part, these oversights have been corrected on this newly remastered 2-disc special edtion. The picture quality exhibits marginal improvements in both clarity and fidelity, due in large part to the fact that this time around the disc has been enhanced for widescreen televisions. Colors are rich, bold, vibrant but at times tend to be garishly unbalanced. Occasionally flesh tones may appear slightly on the pasty side. Otherwise, there is a deep, textured look to the visual presentation that is thoroughly in keeping with the subject matter. Contrast and black levels are bang on. Fine details are nicely realized. Pixelization still exists and sometimes breaks up finer background information. Also, certain scenes tend to look as though some edge effects have been added. Again, all these shortcomings are relatively minor for a picture that will surely not disappoint! The audio has been remastered to 5.1 and exhibits a very visceral and thrilling sonic experience. The sound of Count Laszlo's plane flying over the dunes is both aggressive and stirring and the musical score is wonderfully spread across all 5 channels.EXTRAS: include a very comprehensive commentary by writer-director Anthony Minghella, producer Saul Zaentz and author, Michael Ondaatje. Minghella has more to say than the other two but all contribute fascinating tidbits to the production of the film and the inspiration for the novel. The deleted scenes segment is presented in a unique way - I won't ruin it for anyone but needless to say it's more refreshing than the treatment usually afforded deleted scenes. The CBC's documentary on the making of the film is somewhat of a disappointment, relying heavily on trailer junkets and very little but sound bytes from cast and crew. A series of featurettes round out the involvement of Zaentz, Minghella and production designer Stuart Craig.  There's also a nice series of interviews with the cast and crew and a great featurette on Phil Brady, the stills photographer.BOTTOM LINE:The culmination of all this extra material and the rather impressive quality of the film transfer lead me to recommend ""The English Patient"" to all who love a good story and a thoroughly engrossing, great film.",N/A

792423,"An enticing and relevant indie effort, ""Thirteen"" stands as a pleasant surprise and a peculiar teen movie. This coming-of-age tale about a 13-old girl (the impressive Evan Rachel Wood, from the TV-Show ""Once and Again"") who suddently begins exploring her darker side isn`t grounbreaking material, yet suceeds as a compelling effort nonetheless.Director Chaterine Hardwicke offers an intriguing debut oeuvre, one that dares to take a deep and risky look at today`s teenagers. ""Thirteen"" presents a strong and vivid visual style, full of energy and dynamism and somewhat reminiscent of MTV. The direction also offers a documentary-like quality, being quite realistic and credible on its approach. Hardwicke manages to develop key subjects such as family connections, sexual initiation, drug and alcohol abuse, school relationships and hierarquies, the access to popularity and many other key issues of urban societies.Although this movie could have been an average and moralistic afterschool special, it wisely avoids easy melodrama and stereotyped situations, presenting a wide-eyed perspective with enough ambiguity and depth. The lead character Tracy changes quite fast (perhaps way too fast), and her search for a different and stronger personality is well showcased here, evolving from a cute, smart and innocent girl to an experienced, trendy and hip ""lolita"" that enters a downward spiral. The movie`s pacing is well-balanced and the powerful soundtrack adds a vital sense of rythm and confusion. The performances are noteworthy as well, especially Holly Hunter as a young and worried mother who doesn`t know how to react to her daughter`s behaviour.(...)",Thirteen
925607,"I am a student of history and have read extensively in this period so I was looking forward to this film.  Unfortunately this is a terribly flawed film and this begins with Orlando Bloom who is terribly miscast. Dirt and grit does not make you either masculine or heroic.  Bloom is alleged to be a ""blacksmith"" but he is probably about 50 pounds too light to be convincing in that role.  We are expected to believe that in a matter of hours / days he becomes a skilled warrior capable of ending off some well armed and mounted men-at-arms.  Mastering the broadsword requires a great deal more practice.The villains in the film are based on actual characters and come across pretty much like I think they were.  The Muslims are portrayed in a rather sympathetic light which isn't too far from the historical record.  I thought the film was relatively slow, Bloom was miscast, but the photography was good as were the costumes.  I thought the storyline was a little too politically correct and the ending was simply not believable.  A little more action might have helped.  Overall a so-so film but one that could have been better.",N/A

703090,"Sometimes hokey, sometimes eerily effective, this adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" is directed by Stuart Gordon, who did the popular ""Re-Animator"" films.If you're looking for a truly faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's work, you won't find it here.  For that, you should check out Lurker Films' ""The Call of Cthulhu"" and the three volumes of the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival available on DVD (all can be ordered from Amazon).""Dagon"", like most commercial Lovecraft-based films, mixes a the basic story concepts of ""Shadow"" --- with a nod to the story of the title, ""Dagon"", and it's a reasonably entertaining film.My major objection is that there are one or two scenes of truly stomach-turning gore that not only go way beyond what's needed to tell a story, but are at odds with the mood and atmosphere Gordon has established in the film.  Just as Lovecraft himself sometimes attempted to bury his readers in a torrent of adjectives and adverbs in an attempt to create overwhelming horror, Gordon goes way over the top and succeeds only in disgusting the audience rather than horrifying it.  Of course, if extreme gore is your thing, you won't object to these sequences, but to me it's just disgusting.On the plus side, the eerie village is beautifully designed (with fairly good CGI), the story clips along at a good pace, and the ending is satisfying.  Certainly not a great piece of cinema, but Lovecraft fans should check it out.  Just be prepared for one really repulsive scene.  (I fast-forwarded through it.)",Dagon
536378,"The late movie for last night was ""Bridgit Jones's Diary"" starring Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Huge Grant. I found the movie on our DVD shelves and it must have been there by the action of my separated wife. I have trouble watching sappy romance movies, and she loves them. In any case, Zellweger was the main character (Bridget) and played an unmarried mid-thirties woman who was becoming ever more apprehensive about her situation. Her two off - again, on-again love interests were Hugh Grant (a dork hampered with a dour personality), who she met at one of her mother's social gatherings, and Colin Firth (Mr. Smooth)  who was her supervisor at the office where she worked. Yaawwwnnnn! Neither didn't seem to go very well and neither was convincing. She hated Grant, so Firth turned out to be first in line and all was going well until he was discovered playing around with a high-powered lawyer. Next came Grant. Oh yes, somewhere along the line, in a non-convincing little side plot, her mother gave her father the boot for a seedy on-screen television salesman. Alas, then Grant seemed to have problems with the same lawyer. Ho-hum. Life in London is so complicated.The movie was well produced and flowed along at a nice rate. The photography and settings were well done. The Acting was fairly good. However, all this just couldn't overcome the dreadful script.

1166421,"The original Lost Boys is an amazing movie, it's just so well done, and when I hear a sequel is being made 21 years after the original, I can not help but be a little nonplussed about it. Sounds like someone is trying to cash in on a name to me. But for some reason, I still pre-ordered it, for $10 mind you. Then the early reviews starting rolling in, and they basically called it a disaster. My expectations went from low to nonexistent in a heartbeat. So it comes in the mail and I watch it, here's the formula: Take the original Lost Boys, keep this one pretty much the same, but add more gore and sex. Next, take out the really cool soundtrack and replace it with a really bad one. Then replace the cool vampires with really lame Buffy vampires who play too many video games and emulate Jackass. Sprinkle in some bad acting and a borderline annoying female lead, and you have Lost Boys: The Tribe. All that being said, it really wasn't that bad, calling it an average movie is being a little generous but I will leave it as such. It's insulting to have this movie bear the Lost Boys name, because it does not have nearly the same heart or atmosphere. But as a vampire movie, you're looking at a mediocre horror version of Laguna Beach, or the OC or some other equally horrible show. I can not solidly recommend it, but I can say that it does have some nice gore and Corey Feldman does a nice job as Edgar Frog. Remember how he was in the original? Cheesy and fun? Same thing here, good job Corey. And revealing anything else would be a spoiler. This is definitely not worth the full retail price, even at $10 I feel a little ripped off, but for half that, I would feel as if I got my money's worth.",N/A

I knew that going in, so it made it kind of strange to view, in that respect. However, the story seemed very realistic.

741883,"...""Footlight Frenzy""? it's a videotaping of a live stage performance by this same comedy group and it is a masterpiece of verbal, physical, situational and slapstick comedy. It only played briefly on HBO way back in 1980 and had a small release on VHS (RKO Video). If you like ""Bullshot"", your jaw will bounce off the floor for ""Footlight"".One joke example: (I won't go into the set up except to say a guy is on a stage in a play and has to drink a martini. He doesn't know that the water isn't working in the theatre so the stage manager just scooped some water out of the toilet for the prop. You can see that realization hit the actor when he pours it into his mouth. That's the set up.) He slowly turns until the hand holding the now empty martini glass is upstage, out of sight of the audience, holding it down at his hidden side. Slowly he leans over and lets the fluid dribble out of the corner of his mouth back into the glass down by his leg, not spilling a drop.) Brilliant. The whole thing is like that.Hopefully, someday, the Loan Moan Spectacular (the name of this comedy troup) will license the rights and it will become available again. The world will laugh.Bullshot has a few of those moments of brilliance, but not nearly enough to satisfy. Also, because it's a film and therefore able to move around it loses a lot of focus and seems fumbling from time to time. Pleasant but not amazing.",N/A
559441,"Overall, this movie left me disappointed. The acting left something to be desired (to put it lightly), it didn't really have a plot, and it was unsatisfying in general. There's a slight love storyline between two of the characters, but it's underdeveloped, and was probably just added to give the movie more mass appeal. The highlight of the movie by far was John Digweed's cameo, in a scene where he has a conversation with an aspiring DJ after performing a set. Sure, it gave some insight into the whole rave-underground world, and the whole party set is really cool (they have a chill room, a dance floor, a living room, a fruit and water stand, a massage room... they have an entire warehouse to work with!). &quot;Groove&quot; is worth a try, and can be entertaining at points - but if you're looking to  experience a rave vicariously by watching this, that's not the way to do it--  just GO to one.

412029,"""The Glory Guys"" is actually two Westerns in one. On the one hand, the film boasts an insightful script by Sam Peckinpah that explores the dilemma a junior army officer faces when he realizes his commanding officer is letting personal emotions overcome the commander's better military judgment, placing the troops in their brigade in unnecessary danger. On the other hand, the film also features the standard silly plot complications of a 60s action film: a hackneyed love triangle and knockdown barroom brawls.The movie is a thinly disguised fictionalization of George Custer's Little Big Horn campaign, as told from the standpoint of junior officers. In the film, an army general (Andrew Duggan in the Custer role) prepares his command to take part in a major offensive with several other units against the Indians, with the stated objective of forcing them onto the reservation. In reality, Duggan is out for personal glory and wants his command alone to deal the decisive blow to the Indians. Tom Tryon plays a captain (a fictionalized version of Custer subordinates Major Reno and Captain Benteen) who served under Duggan previously and transferred out of the general's command following an earlier battle in which the general deliberately sacrificed a company of poorly trained recruits to draw the Indians out. Now, Duggan has pulled strings to get Tryon transferred back and orders him to train some more new recruits for the upcoming offensive.I'm guessing that Peckinpah's original script for ""Glory Guys"" emphasized the battle of wills between Tryon and Duggan, as Tryon tries to be the professional soldier and train his troops, even as he realizes that Duggan does not intend to take part in a coordinated attack but, instead, rush his troops into battle on their own. It's a theme that Peckinpah would explore in greater depth in his next script, ""Major Dundee,"" a film he also directed. The scenes pitting Duggan and Tryon are by far the best dramatic scenes in the film. Unfortunately, only bits and pieces of these themes find their way into the finished movie. Instead, the film, as directed by Arnold Laven (primarily a TV director), is pretty much routine studio fare.Instead of spending most of his time squabbling with his commanding officer, Tryon spends most of his time vying with the general's chief scout (Harve Presnell) for the affection of a local widow (Senta Berger). This romantic triangle is quite tiresome and very predictable (any viewer who's ever seen a 60s Western can guess within five minutes after Presnell's character is introduced how it will turn out). ""Glory Guys"" also stints on depicting the troops' training. All viewers get to see are a couple of scenes of them taking target practice and trying to ride, all the while being browbeaten by Tryon, who continually berates them (supposedly, this type of ""tough love"" is needed to get them into shape, but the movie doesn't devote enough time to the training to make it realistic). With so little time devoted to the troops, nearly all of them are interchangeable bit players. The only two soldiers given any depth are two more Western stereotypes, the loud mouthed Irishman (James Caan) and the innocent young kid (Michael Anderson, Jr.) in love with an equally innocent town girl.""Glory Guys"" does devote plenty of screen time to showing a couple of those incredibly fake brawls in which everyone gets a goofy look on their face when an opponent's wild haymaker punch lands, people get knocked through doors and windows a lot, and entire rooms of furniture gets smashed, but no one is the worse for wear other than a couple of bruises. All in all, the brawls are about as convincing and entertaining as a backyard wrestling league battle royal.Eventually, ""Glory Guys"" features  a major battle between the cavalry and the Indians, and, the sequence is quite well staged. Back then, studio productions employed plenty of extras and sizable numbers of troops on each side in a major battle and the money spent and attention paid to detail show here. The sequence lasts about twenty minutes and is exciting throughout, while, at the same time, easy for viewers to follow. Although anyone familiar with Custer's final campaign knows how the battle will turn out (and how the movie will end), the high level of realism in the combat sequence helps the movie maintain as much suspense as possible.For the most part, ""Glory Guys"" is indistinguishable from dozens of other Westerns of that era, albeit with stars Tryon and Presnell having considerable less screen presence than the leads of most comparable A-level Westerns (when Peckinpah did finally make ""Major Dundee,"" he was working with Charlton Heston and Richard Harris). It's probably no coincidence that the movie marked the end of both Tryon's and Presnell's career as leading men. Fortunately, the film has a first rate set piece finale and enough well-written dramatic tension in some of the earlier scenes for me to give it a mild recommendation. However, there's just not enough glory here to warrant a better rating.",Glory Guys VHS

His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is disappointed in his lack of ambition. Shaun's best friend Ed (Nick Frost) epitomizes this arrested development. Ed's simian humor (he literally imitates gorillas) amuses Shaun to no end, but leaves their other roommate, Shaun's girlfriend, and her judgmental roommates Diane and Dylan (Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran) cold.In the midst of his personal problems, Shaun finds himself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Is this his chance to find his inner strength and get his life together? That is, if he survives?This comedy has amusing and surreal moments of silliness and satire, but its humor isn't for everyone. For those whose funny bone it doesn't strike, the film's strength comes from its metaphors. Shaun feels stuck in his routines, held back and a little dead inside--not unlike a zombie. In fact, the drones populating the city of London already resemble the living dead. Shaun is so oblivious to his fellow humans and the world around him, he hardly realizes an epidemic is upon them.Our hero's journey from overlooked ""loser"" to courageous leader is also satisfying. He finds himself torn between the well-intended but prepubescent friend of his youth and his girlfriend's affections.

1204395,"Natalie Wood definitely deserves a tribute. This DVD box set, comprised of movies she made for Warner Brothers studio, is definitely a mixed bag. No one will argue that ""Bombers B-52"" or ""Cash McCall"" are especially memorable, or among Natalie's best work. That leaves us with two classics (""Splendor In The Grass"" and ""Gypsy""), one silly farce (""Sex And The Single Girl"") and one oddity that is interesting and worthwhile (""Inside Daisy Clover"").""Splendor In The Grass"" (1961) is easily the best film in this box set, and probably the quintessential Natalie Wood film. Deanie and Bud (Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty) are in love, but her mother (Audrey Christie) tells her that ""nice girls don't enjoy sex."" Deanie is confused, especially with the example of Bud's promiscuous and free-spirited sister Jenny (Barbara Loden) before her. Bud wants to stay on the family farm and marry Deanie, but his overbearing father (Pat Hingle) wants him to go to Harvard. Deanie's sexual repression leads to a dangerous suicide attempt at a waterfall (Natalie did the  frightening swimming scene herself) and mental breakdown. Natalie, who received an Oscar nomination, is an appealing mixture of poignancy and strength, and Warren Beatty is quite impressive in his film debut. ""Splendor"" holds up extremely well. If you don't believe me, just watch the terrible TV remake from the 1980's  with Melissa Gilbert, mis-cast and totally out of her depth, in Natalie's role. The original, with Natalie, is a classic. (5 Stars). 1961 was an excellent year, professionally, for Natalie. Following ""Splendor,"" she gave another beautiful performance, as Maria in the Oscar winning smash mega-hit ""West Side Story.""""Gypsy"" (1962): After having her vocals dubbed by Marni Nixon in ""West Side Story"", Natalie's singing is all her own in this film version of the Broadway classic. Natalie is perfect as Louise Hovac, whether  as a tomboy, dressed in baggy clothes with a page-boy haircut, or later, all woman, sexily stripping off as sophisticated Gypsy Rose Lee. Rosalind Russell is just fine (with vocal help from Lisa Kirk) as her ambitious, driven, and delusional, Mama Rose. I certainly did not miss the hideous Broadway hag known as Ethel Merman. (4 Stars out of 5).""Sex And The Single Girl"" (1964) Tony Curtis, working for a smutty tabloid magazine, is determined to prove that Natalie Wood, as ""sexpert"" Dr. Helen Brown, is actually (Gasp!) a virgin! Whether she is or not is never anwered.This ridiculous sex farce soon runs out of steam and becomes a slapstick farce, with a wildly prolonged car chase on the freeway. (3 Stars Out of 5).""Inside Daisy Clover"" (1965) By age 26, Natalie Wood is too adult to be entirely convincing as a 15 year old ""child singing star"", but she does have the Hollywood credentials. The page boy haircut that worked so well in ""Gypsy"" does not work so well for ""Daisy Clover."" Daisy is supposed to be a singing sensation, in the mode of  a teenage Judy Garland. Natalie's vocals are dubbed by another lady again. Marni Nixon's dubbing for Natalie in ""West Side Story"" was well-done. The dubbing for Natalie in ""Daisy"" (not Marni Nixon) is bad...well, honestly, awful!Everything else about the film seems a bit off, too. Gavin Lambert's script veers wildly between macabre black comedy, satire, and melodrama. The best performances are given by Robert Redford as Wade Lewis, the ""closeted"" gay matinee idol who encourages Daisy's rebellious nature, marries her, and promptly abandons her; and an especially effective and creepy Christopher Plummer as ""Prince Of Darkness"" movie mogul Raymond Swan. In Natalie's best scene, she has an altogether too convincing and frightening nervous breakdown inside a recording booth. The overall film is uneven, but worthwhile and interesting, nevertheless.(3 Stars Out of 5).",N/A
1220610,"Based on Cornelia Funke's novel, Inkheart presents a supremely fascinating concept with limitless possibilities - unfortunately the direction it takes falls into the predictable realm of formulaic fantasy (it's as if a quota must be reached for daring escapes, rescue attempts and damsels in distress). The basic plot is as convoluted and faulty as time travel, and without very finite ground rules, the details and conclusion feel contrived - unnaturally forced in order to neatly right the predicaments. Several characters are wasted and the most adventurous avenues are left completely unexplored, but for a fun-filled fantasy film Inkheart isn't entirely a letdown. First-rate special effects and well-paced action put this inventive picture well above the utter failures of Eragon or The Seeker.Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart (Brendan Fraser) has a rare magical gift that allows him to bring to life anything he reads out loud from a book. It's more complicated than it sounds - when he reads aloud, the elements in each passage are transported into his current location, as if directly from the world defined in the book, and someone from his own time is sent into the book in exchange. This implies that every written story must create an environment that exists on a unique timeline, and that those creations exist somewhere in three dimensions. Further confusion is introduced when one of the characters Mo brings to life (or rather out of the book's life) worries about how his story will end, hinting that each book also has a timeline concurrent with present time - and later that the characters in books can change the course of their destiny, even though it's cemented in unchanging printed words.Mo's troubles start because he is unaware he has such an ability (humans with this skill are known as Silvertongues). He reads the story of Inkheart to his young daughter and wife, unleashing the dastardly villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis), along with the roguish fire-juggling Dustfinger (Paul Bettany). Mo's wife vanishes and Capricorn sets about building himself an army of storybook henchmen. Mo vows never to read another book out loud and so twelve years pass without incident. His daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) has grown up and wonders about Mo's obsessive quest to obtain another copy of the Inkheart book to try and correct his decade-old error. When he finally finds another copy in an antiquarian bookshop, Dustfinger reappears, begging the Silvertongue to return him to his world; when Mo refuses, the ilk of Capricorn is summoned to force compliance.There are well-intentioned themes (involving the power of reading and writing among others) floating around in the story of Inkheart, but the film fails to fully illustrate the creativity of the major concepts. The villains are of course unthreatening (this is a kid's movie after all), Helen Mirren's supporting role is wasted, and each of the characters is designed in the most generic manner. For a plot that is already incredibly outlandish and difficult to accept, it's odd to cast Brendan Fraser, who brings an instant air of goofiness and tongue-in-cheek humor to a character that would have been more effective if played seriously.In one scene a Silvertongue is forced to read out of various books to prove her skill; as the camera pans across the room the audience can see Cinderella's glass slipper, Huckleberry Finn's raft, a gingerbread house from Hansel and Gretel, the Sword in the Stone and many more recognizable storybook entities. It's at this moment, with countless novels at the creator's disposal, that we acknowledge the biggest disappointment: imagining what could have been. What an amazingly unique concept with such mediocre execution.- Mike Massie",Inkheart (DVD)

Gozilla is an independent company and the claim of ""digital remastered"" did have me doubting.  When the package arrived I was in for a good surprise. The packaging is well done and the 8 discs are well secured in the single case. The image quality was a lot better than expected. It is true that it is not 1080HD but Gozilla made a very good effort in enhancing and improving the original prints on each episode.While some artifacts remain the image itself is very clean, sharper and the colors are bright and balanced.Occasionally the sound levels drop but not a big deal.  I recommend this to anyone since there are only a couple box sets available and I do not think the full collection will ever be officially released by any major studios.Note: On each episode the Gozilla logo flashes in and out in the lower corner, not a major issue but wish it was left off of the actual episodes.

104613,"This could have been a five-star entry into Hammer's Frankenstein series--one which I consider superior to the one produced by Universal. But, unfortunately, the portrayal of the central character, Baron Frankenstein, is off when compared to other entries in the series, particularly high-points like ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""Frankenstein Created Woman.""In those films, there was something twistly heroic about Frankenstein... one almost finds oneself hoping he'll succeed. But here, he is just a vicious killer, a brutal rapist, a creature with no redeeming qualities safe for the inherent charm of Peter Cushing, the actor who portrays him.The tale has Frankenstein blackmail a crooked doctor at a local asylum into giving him access to a mad scientist soFrankenstein can cure the madness through brain surgery. The corruption of Frankenstein and the crooked doctor spread to engulf the doctor's otherwise innocent fiance. On the very night of Frankenstein's seeming triumph, everyone ends up paying for their crimes, including Frankenstein himself.The ""morality play"" aspect of this film works extremely well. What doesn't work is Frankenstein's completely monstrous nature. And it's made worse by the brutal rape he visits upon Victoria Carlson (who gives what is probably her best performance in this film). It's a shame really that the central character should be so off in the way he was written.",Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed VHS

548552,"A critic named Pauline Kael has once said that there are such things as good trash and bad trash when it comes to movies. Her theory could certainly be proven under ""Dragoon"", an anime so goofy that since then NO SEQUEL's been made to follow up with it, even though the story is not yet completed. From the dubbing to the animation, nothing is pitch perfect, but it could be worth a chuckle or two, and it makes for great fanfiction material.""Dragoon's"" story is one of the oldest stories of all time. Basically, Sedon, a young man with an aging father, must now carry on his father's skill and courage to survive the future. That future arrives to him in the form of a lost and beautiful woman, who doesn't remember that she is part of an evil plan, and therefore many villains want her. Along the way, the young man must protect the woman through his healer sister, a lance-wielding prince named Lain, a fiery beaut named Lilith and her trusty knife-wielding assistant.That's about where the differences end. The animation is corny, nothing as skillful compared to Digimon or anything from Clamp. But there's a ton of nudity included in this one. The shiest character, the woman May, has a nude scene almost every 10 minutes!!! If that doesn't get your noodle nutty, read this; Sedon's sister and Lilith also bare their bums too. This is a guilty-pleasure anime that's just ambrosia to anime nerds who dig naked women in a medieval setting.You want violence? There is some, especially some graphic explosions and swordplay with blood shooting everywhere. But it's very tame compared to the nudity, which no doubt is the explanation for the anime's +17 rating.The characters can be good for some, bad for others. Let me explain. The characters have hardly a mite for any development. They are often involved in predictable situations (e.g., sibling rivalry, uneasy inheritance of power) that you've seen before not just in anime, but in ""Dawson's Creek"". My favorite characters are Lilith, Sedon's sister and Lain. I couldn't gather much info, but I think Lain and Sedon's sister make quite a couple. I wouldn't mind Sedon and Lilith, but I have no idea who May really is. She's not a character, just a plot point that will have men leering at her from all angles.Maybe you folks could spare a view of ""Dragoon"", but if you really like it, be warned; there's no sequel made for this story. Then again, why don't you conjure your own sequel? That way, you could imagine all the nudity that you want.",Dragoon VHS
1097881,"MAN, I am really surprised how disappointing Bender's Big Score turned out to be.I am a huge fan of the television series, but something seriously went wrong with the movie. There's almost no humor whatsoever. It's like the writers are desperately holding on to the episodes that are now considered some of the best of the series, and recycled the same plotlines for a film, and not bothering to take the time to include any actual *jokes*. That's honestly the impression I got after watching Bender's Big Score.It's not completely mediocre- I mean, there's still several segments of the movie that feature solid writing and some great animation (sometimes AMAZING animation even) and there's several moments that definitely bring a smile to my face at least (mostly because they bring back memories of the glory days of the show).But the storyline and the pacing feel VERY predictable and significantly less funny compared to the style that was presented to us with the series.I thought the Simpsons Movie was a bit of a letdown compared to the show (older AND newer episodes) and I'm afraid if Bender's Big Score is any indication, Futurama may be following in the same footsteps.The characters we've come to love from the show are all featured in the movie, but it's like they constantly blurt one a bunch of one-liners throughout the film *just* for the purpose of making an appearance in the movie.

613384,"I was surprisingly displeased of this movie. I was hoping for an rousing, epic-long extravangaza. But this film is somewhat of a dissapointment. It has 'extraordinary' flaws even a viewer can spot. It's frantic action from one scene to another provides us without a sense of logic for its characters.The characters, I should say, is lead by ageless Sean Connery. He commands a group of superheroes to fight a villian who wants to conquest earth. Some of the interesting heroes include Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and a stunning vampiress. They're postively good, but don't have that much screen time. That's one of the flaws here. Again, the fast-paced action muddles throughout the film. The script, which makes a great movie, is a fault which the film can't correct. It just focuses on the action! The cast is almost a waste. Connery can't seem to break out and have fun. I guess his confrontations with director Stephen Norrington was a reason. He has no motivation.The visuals are somewhat fair. It was just uninspired. A good thing about this movie was the early 20th-century production design. The climax also is ineffective and leaves too many answers. Even though I haven't read the comic books, fans probably won't like this. I giving this 3 stars because of the relivent flaws, but the good production design helped me from giving this film 2 stars.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

She is VERY verbal, talking non-stop, and painstakingly showing correct positions while slowly going through the drills. She makes a few errors as she speaks, but instead of doing another take, she corrects herself, occasionally laughing at her own flub. This might get annoying with repeated viewings. The group drills definitely flow better than the individual instruction section, with no stopping to explain technique, but the viewer is confused by the strange angles. Zoe faces her students and everyone is filmed at a sort of sideways angle to the camera. Speaking of camera, at times the cameraman focuses on Zoe's upper body during a drill (and also, unforgivably, during Zoe's performance.) It might take me several viewings to figure out some of these drill sequences. This is not a dvd for beginners, but for more intermediate students of tribal style belly dance.

1510748,"In spite of its mixed messages about female sexuality, What's Your Number is surprisingly funny and even touching. Anna Faris plays Ally who hopes to find a date to her sister Daisy's (Ari Graynor) wedding. After reading that most women who have twenty or more sexual partners never settle down, she is determined that her next lay be ""the one."" To prevent raising the number of men she's slept with, Ally enlists the help of her philandering neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) to track down her exes hoping they improved over time.One of the film's problems is its unintentional similarities to the superior Bridesmaids. The heroine has mixed feelings about a wedding, meets a man who encourages her to follow her artistic sensibilities, and struggles with unemployment. (""Struggles"" is an overstatement; considering their financial situations, these characters have remarkable apartments.) Even the opening scene contains a gag that is nearly identical to one in Bridesmaids.Still, the movie is more irreverent and amusing than most romantic comedies. Farris is hilarious as Ally, a young woman who makes many mistakes but never runs out of optimism. Evans is fairly appealing as Colin, the obligatory rogue with a heart of gold. Since he admits that he can hardly spend time with a woman without trying to sleep with her, she doesn't consider him an option. Instead, she rendezvous with an assortment of ex-boyfriends and flings, played by a pleasing array of actors. A large part of the movie's appeal consists of her awkward interactions with men played by familiar faces such as Joel McHale, Chris Pratt, Zachary Quinto, Martin Freeman, and Anthony Mackie.The film also focuses on Ally's relationship with her family. She feels out of place with her more conventional sister and perfectly coiffed mother, in spite of their close relationships. All this, of course, channels towards her inevitable lesson about love and being herself. Many women will identify with her grapples with relationship advice, the media, and questions about a ""normal"" modern woman's sexual appetites. The movie touches on the thin line between giving someone a chance and trying to force a relationship.Unfortunately, the movie undermines some of its more progressive themes. It certainly includes sexist stereotypes, not to mention weightism. Ally is meant to be a disaster, but she often looks perfect and is shot sexually. (To be fair, Colin is naked throughout most of the movie.) When it comes down to it, though Ally doesn't fit into the film world, she is still a man's ideal woman. She isn't high maintenance, enjoys watching and playing sports (in one scene, she engages in a sexy one-on-one basketball game--in her underwear), and is up for almost anything.There are definitely moments where the film crosses the line into poor taste. The whole thing is difficult to take seriously. The ""comedic"" music makes the movie feel as though it should have a laugh track. But What's Your Number ultimately conveys the ""life is messy: embrace it"" message with (mostly) good-natured humor.",What's Your Number

There are films that horrify you because of the gruesome imagery that bombards you while you sit in the darkened theater.  And then there are films whose haunting and horrifying nature is magnified even more because it is based on events that actually happened.  Such a film is Roland Joffe's ""The Killing Fields.""""The Killing Fields"" chronicles the journey of two friends who find themselves swept up in the revolution in Cambodia during the 1970s.  As the Khmer Rouge comes to power, New York Times writer Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and his assistant Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) witness firsthand the transformation of Cambodia's cities and countryside under the new regime.  As the situation becomes more dire, Schanberg finds himself in a difficult situation - he knows Pran will run afoul of the new government once the Khmer Rouge completes their takeover but Schanberg still needs him to finish his duties for the New York Times.  Both men hope for the best but when Pran attempts to leave the country, he finds that his window of opportunity has disappeared and he is trapped in Cambodia.""The Killing Fields"" is a film that pulls no punches.  Watching Pran trying to stay alive from day to day is a sobering viewing experience.  While its story explores the broader political implications of the rise of the Khmer Rogue, the true drama revolves around Pran who embodies the personal suffering of all of the regime's victims.  While Waterston is outstanding, this is a film that delivers it message through Pran, and Ngor is more than up to the demands of his role.  His performance is honest to the point of heartbreak.

Like a roller coaster, it's just about the ride.  Others prefer the intellectual or psychological, a tale that slowly develops and allows viewer imagination to dictate not only what is transpiring, but also whether or not the content is, indeed, frightening.  Given the fact Paranormal Activity falls into the latter category, I'm somewhat surprised by its relative success.Rather than taking a step ahead, PA takes a sidestep with the handheld camera concept made popular by Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield.  Avoiding too much of the rapid movements sure to induce epilepsy and migraines, PA provides a terrifying tale of a couple's cursed home.  The majority of the film is Micah talking into the video camera about a demon freeloading in the house while his girlfriend Katie self-loathingly impersonates every bad Cathy comic ever puked onto newspaper.  The only worthwhile parts are the sleeping scenes for two reasons:1)  When they are scary, they allow the viewers to anticipate and work into frenzy.2)  When they are boring, they allow the viewer to catch a quick cat-nap while Katie acts paranoid.There are a few unnerving, slowly paced scenes shot while the couple slept that could substitute for the worst insomnia commercials ever or the best advertisement for single beds in adjoining rooms in history.

178682,"Ahh, what is there to be said. After watching both as soon as I got the DVD from Amazon, I find that I am completely dumbfounded at Scott's choices of cuts in the director's edition. The first half was magic as only true fantasy storytelling could be in every aspect except the music (which I'll get to later). However, after the setting moves to Darkness' keep, it becomes apparent why Scott made the cuts he made in the first place when Legend was first theatrically released. The standoff between Darkness and Lili loses its edge and tension with the director's cut and becomes something akin to dinner conversation with a new date. This is symptomatic of the entire second half, as the director's cut loses the cohesiveness and pacing of the original release with alot of unnecessary and out of place scenes and dialogue. Yes I understand that such scenes were meant to add to each character's development, but I think Scott failed in that regard here. In the first half he was successful, revealing for the first time Jack's ability to speak with animals and such, but in the dramatic second half it just gets in the way and interrupts the drama and action. And Darkness' father has a really annoying voice now too.As for the music, I really was disappointed with Goldsmith's work, which has been superb in other movies. It was not nearly as emotive as the TD score nor as unique and supportive of the scenes. Specifically, the TD score was far superior in the black dress dancing scene a waltzy dance number with a hint of discord and evil whereas the Goldsmith score was a dance, rather light and breezy which of course did not fit at all. And he botched the ending! The original ending was nearly perfect, and he completely deviates from it. But oh well, I have to go to work, hope this helps.",N/A

233695,"I LOVE YOU, ALICE B. TOKLAS! (1968) (94 minutes).  A half-forgotten nearly 50 year old comedy from the Peter Sellers catalog that deserves another look.  As written by Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker, and helmed by Hy Averback, this Los Angeles-based biting satire stars  Sellers as a prim, middle-aged Jewish lawyer, a self-admitted 30-something square who decides to "" turn on, tune in, drop out,"" as they used to say.  He jilts his fianc&eacute;e and embraces the 1960s counterculture after falling for a nubile flower child.Sellers (THE PINK PANTHER, DR. STRANGELOVE), plays Harold Fine, whose dull existence gives way to the hippie lifestyle. Almost immediately after free-spirited Nancy, (Leigh Taylor-Young, PEYTON PLACE), enters his world and unleashes his inhibitions with spiked brownies. Joyce Van Patten, (GROWNUPS, MARLEY AND ME), as Joyce, Harold's secretary/fianc&eacute;e; and Jo Van Fleet, (COOL LAND LUKE, GUNFIGHT AT OK CORRAL, and one tough mother in EAST OF EDEN), as Harold's mother provide fine support.  You should see them bust out into belly laughs after eating the spiked brownies.  David Arkin plays Harold's brother Herbie; Herb Edelman plays Harold's law partner Murray.  Grady Sutton puts in a delicious turn as the funeral director more than inconvenienced by a lightning strike of hearse drivers.First thing to say about this movie, it's still funny, though perhaps it shows a different, more muted side of its star's comic powers.  Second outstanding fact, along with EASY RIDER, THE GRADUATE, GEORGY GIRL, BLOWUP and Elaine May's HEARTBREAK KID,  made in 1971, a couple of years later, it is an accurate portrayal of the time it was made.  That would be the turbulent, now near mythical 1960s, the decade of sex, drugs and rock and roll.  I've never heard the word ""groovy"" used so many times in my long life.  And you should see the hilarious getup of Joyce's bridesmaids in the scenes of her aborted marriage to Harold.I actually saw this movie back then in real time when it came out, and don't think I've seen it again since then, until now.  But I do remember musing, even back then, on how short the cinema life of a flavor of the month young actress can be.  There's Taylor-Young with her--get this, ONE tattoo, on her OUTER  THIGH, how daring.  A butterfly, which Sellers identifies as a Monarch.  To dip into the Jewish vernacular, it wouldn't help.  Didn't help Taylor-Young, who soon disappeared from film.  And, I was struck on a re-viewing of the film by just how biting the satire is.  Some may think the Jewish satire is over-the-top, though of course Sellers, and much of the other talent before and behind the camera was Jewish, and I suppose that influenced the picture's content.  Furthermore, today's Hispanic viewers might be offended by some of the content.  Fine is representing the 11-member Rodriguez family in an auto accident case: one morning they all troop into his office, grand-dad down to the kiddies, wearing neck braces.  And the lawyerly Harold points out that all 11 of them were in the car, a clear violation of local law.  And, in addition, there were chickens in the car, an even clearer violation of local law.  Well, the movie's still funny.  You might want to take another look at it if you too saw it way back then.  Or a first look if you enjoy Peter Sellers' work.",I Love You Alice B Toklas VHS

790654,"Almen Wong plays a woman who runs a camp that kidnaps 12 and 13 year old girls and trains them to be assassins.  They start out with about 30 girls and only one of them will survive.  After the girls are trained for 6 years they are forced to kill eachother in different competitions.  In the second of these competitions it is decided to let 3 of the girls live instead of 1.  2 of the the girls (Maggie Q and Anya) are very close to eachother and the other one (Jewel Lee) is a cold blooded killing machine.  When the girls take up their positions as assassins, the movie all of a sudden becomes extremely boring and mindless.  The cop that is following the assassins is one of the most incompetent lead actors I have ever seen.  Nothing he does is believable and while he looks to be about 23 years old, he acts 14.  Then you would think it would be exciting when the girls go on their missions, but there is no thought put into it.  Some bad guy is inserted at the end of the movie and him and one of the girl assassins fight to the death.  It is completely ridiculous!  The movie is produced by Wong Jing so I did expect it to be stupid, but the budget and style are much higher caliber than most Wong Jing movies.  And it lives up to its title by having plenty of good looking women in tank tops and short shorts and some brief nudity.  Anya and Maggie Q alone make this worth watching.The fights are what you would expect from Ching Siu Tung.  There is tons of wirework involved and the editing is very unique.  It's too flashy for my tastes, but still fun to watch.  The final fight is like a comic book and if you enjoy other Ching Siu Tung movies, then you are gonna love this.  I hated the final fight inThe Blacksheep Affair(another Ching Siu Tung movie), but the final fight in this is a little more fluent.  If you started watching kung fu movies because ofThe Matrix, then you are probably going to like the action in Naken Weapon.  If you are more of a fan of the old school movies and don't like wirework, then this is not for you.  Like I said it is too flashy for me, but I do appreciate the hard work and creativity put into it.If you are looking for a really good new age girls with guns movie then I highly recommend Corey Yuen'sSo Close.2.5/5This movie was shot in English and the voice acting is a little above average.

Robocop battles a crime wave and many of Detroit's citizens are hooked on the designer drug Nuke! Things get worse when the brain of a sadistic crime boss is put in a new cyborg police officer, Robocop 2! Belinda Bauer is very sexy as a corrupt, power hungry, OCP executive.

The acting in Robocop 2 is good and the production values were high. Comic book artist and writer Frank Miller wrote the story for the film. The duel between Robocop and Cain as Robocop 2 is climactic, but one will have to endure a lot of sadistic scenes of ultraviolence. Also, many key scenes were cut from the 1990 version of Robocop 2. A bad guy with sideburns appears and vanishes from the story. The scene where Robocop is brainwashed into acting like a goody-two shoes was funny, but Robocop 2 has very little comedy or humor.

209619,"As a film, ""Mommie Dearest"", is a mixed bag. It essentially tells the story of reported child abuse by one of America's top Golden Age of Hollywood stars, Joan Crawford. The film is based on the book of the same title by Miss Crawford's adopted daughter, Christine. Whether the abuse, or all of it, actually happened, has been debated over the years, and this review is making no claims one way or the other.The movie starts out well enough and I basically think it was well crafted, written, and acted (not including the 3 scenes where Faye Dunaway's ""interpretation"" of the scenes have made the film a joke to many). Other than Miss Dunaway's aforementioned 3 scenes), Faye does an amazing job of becoming Miss Crawford. Same goes for Diana Scarwid, Steve Forrest, and the rest of the cast. The production values are top notch, as is the score, set design, lighting, and costuming.This DVD pressing has pretty good quality for a DVD, and is a fairly clean print with mostly saturated colors, nice black levels, and normal film grain (not the overly noisy mess you see lately with some Blu Rays that are claimed to be film grain which is just an excuse to release a noisy, blurry, and sub par product).

349409,"A Professional Gun is a very good spaghetti western by Sergio Corbucci that suffers from a horrible DVD release.  The story follows a group of revolutionaries who are fighting the government during the Mexican revolution.  Fighting alongside them is a mercenary who has supplied them with and taught them how to use more advanced weaponry.  There is an uneasy alliance between the mercenary and the rebel leader that at times is very comical.  To make things worse, the army has hired a gunman to hunt down both men and kill them.  The movie on its own is very good with excellent action sequences, good characters, and another great score by Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai.  Fans of spaghetti westerns should check out this movie but stay away from the DVD.Franco Nero stars as Kowalski, the mercenary who sees a chance to make some money during the revolution.  He is good as usual with no complaints on my side.  Tony Musante plays Paco, the revolutionary leader who makes the uneasy agreement with the foreign mercenary.  Jack Palance gets top billing even though his part is rather small.  Even with so little to do, Palance gives another great performance as the villain.  Also, wait for the showdown at the end between two of the main characters, it should not be missed.  The DVD is absolutely horrible.  The picture and sound quality are brutal with very poor extras.  The one thing that is kind of amusing is the trivia quiz.  One of those things where its so bad its good.

888087,"David Gordon Green, the writer and director of Undertow, has actually directed three films between Undertow and his exceptional debut film, George Washington. Nevertheless, Undertow marks his first highly praised film since that debut, and as I see it, reflects his true sophomore film in his precocious directorial career thus far.Sadly, Undertow borrows a bit too much from Terrence Malick. Gordon Green has admittingly stated that he is a Malick disciple (see the Charlie Rose interview for details), but he seems more set upon making a film from that realm of creativity than he actually does from his own. In Undertow, the Malickean borrowing process is at times incredibly annoying, and Gordon Green seems unable to give us a thorough plot with characters we actually give a flip about. I cared for those characters in George Washington, but the characters here in Undertow seem to be sidestepping any type of developmental elements whatsoever, and by the time the film is over, I was actually feeling sorrow for Gordon Green because I knew he was capable of doing much better.PLOT:Two boys living in Georgia with their impoverished father become intrigued by the sudden arrival of their uncle (Josh Lucas) who arrives without warning and with something maniacal brewing in his eyes. Soon, the boys are horrified to learn of what his true intentions are and the stage is set for a great hunt across the hot, summer landscapes of Georgia as they flee their uncle's malevolent pursuit.

262455,"Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be""(1943) has to be the most genuinely bizarre political satire to emerge from Hollywood's golden age. It stars Jack Benny and Carol Lombard as Joseph and Maria Tura - a married couple and stage performers living in occupied Poland during WWII. Determined to alter the course of the war, the two helm a troupe of ham actors in a dead pan comic assault on the Nazis When a spy emerges who has damaging information to the Polish resistance, Joseph and Maria decide to prevent the information from being delivered to the Reich. Benny's brilliant lampoon of Hamlet's soliloquy ""to be or not to be"" is at the crux of a disastrous rendezvous between Maria and Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). Stan gets the hots for Maria - a passion not reciprocated. Hence, when Stan is dispatched for war, he cruelly implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), the real spy who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The theater troupe is then forced to use their thespian skills to ensure their own survival; impersonating Nazi officers and even Hitler in order to outwit the enemy. Controversial to say the very least, ""To Be Or Not to Be"" opened to modest acclaim and was later remade, to limited effect, as a 1983 farce starring Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.Warner's DVD treatment is middle of the road. The black and white image has been mastered from reasonably clean film elements. Contrast levels are adequate, though at times weak. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are sometimes nicely realized but darker scenes suffer from inconsistent quality. Film grain is moderate. Age related artifacts are present throughout. An archival news reel and short subject are the only extras included.",To Be Or Not to Be VHS

1328916,"To be honest, I was first attracted to this film because I'm from The Bronx, I'm Italian and my dad worked for many many years on City Island (let's see, that would make him a Clam Digger, no? Or is he a Mussel Sucker? Hmmm... Tough one.). The other reason is I'm a big fan of Director Raymond De Felitta, who also directed one of my favorite films - Two Family House. City Island focuses on the dysfunctional family of a corrections officer played by Andy Garcia. The problem I had with all the dysfunction was I wasn't able to identify the root causes of said dysfunction. And there was an overkill of dysfunction so that some superfluous dysfunction took away from really important dysfunction. Let me explain. From the beginning, the main dysfunction is apparent: a man with both a dream and marital strife. But there is also child/parent dysfunction, quirks, secrets, abandonment and anger. One problem: we don't know why - not a lot of back story. Andy Garcia's character wants to be an actor and tells his wife he's gambling so that he can go to an acting class which fuels her animosity toward him. It's not clear how they got to that point (keeping your dreams secret is one thing but choosing a lie that fuels anger seemed off to me). While he's at his corrections job and out at acting class, his wife is getting angrier and angrier, the two kids are coming apart at the seams (daughter flunks out of college and can't tell her own uneducated parents she has a problem with school so she becomes a stripper; son inexplicably subscribes to a chubby chaser's website and gets turned on by watching a morbidly obese woman gorging round the clock). In the meantime, Andy Garcia learns that his ""secret son"" from a previous relationship has been transferred to his jail and arranges to take the inmate home to live with the family - work in exchange for jail time. I found that part of the story a little hard to believe. So now we have the core story line which is the man with a secret dream and his lying and scheming to achieve the dream. Then, we have the disgruntled, angry wife story, daughter as stripper story, son as chubby chaser story, secret son from a previous relationship story and if that's not enough, our main character is developing a relationship with a woman from his acting class and she has a story of her own. It's too much at times and for a film with so much, there are actually some surprisingly slow sections that drag on and on and on.The good news is, if you hang on until the last half hour, you'll be satisfied with the ending (I won't spoil that here). I found some of the stories distracting, particularly the son's chubby chasing activity which was quite a disconnect from the type of background the kid came from. There really were no satisfactory explanations or repercussions regarding that behavior which goes against everything I know about Italian families from The Bronx. And trust me, I know Italian families from The Bronx.Of this film and Two Family House, I'll have to say I prefer Two Family House because there was a heart to that film which carried through and you could feel the trials, tribulations and longings of the main character deeply and profoundly. The themes in Two Family House were more universal and relate-able - themes like honesty, loss and singing your own song even if nobody else sings along (kinda literally). In City Island, there are so many distractions from the main story, there are times when you lose sight of the man with the dream. It comes through in the end but there are moments when he fades into the background and you aren't sure why you're even there.It is through the skill of the actors this film actually pulls through. And thankfully so.",N/A

237126,"During the Christmas season of 1978, my uncle and aunt took me to a movie theater to see a double-bill of two holiday-based horror films: John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot; and Bob Clark's &quot;Black Christmas.&quot;  We absolutely loved &quot;Halloween,&quot; but found &quot;Black Christmas&quot; to be so dull that we walked out in the middle of the picture.  Twenty-two years later, I reviewed the WHOLE movie on video and now have a different impression of this film.During the Christmas season, sorority girl Olivia Hussey is pregnant and wants to have an abortion but her boyfriend Keir Dullea doesn't want her to have the procedure.  Meanwhile, Hussey and her sorority sisters(Including a pre-&quot;Superman&quot; Margot Kidder) are also receiving obscene phone calls from a cackling pervert.  The obscene phone caller later sneaks into the attic of the sorority house and starts killing the girls one by one.&quot;Black Christmas&quot; has some major weak points.  The film is slow-moving and monotonous at times.  The movie also lacks the thrills and suspense of Carpenter's &quot;Halloween.&quot;  John Saxon is given a thankless role as a police detective.Nevertheless, every horror fan should sit through all of &quot;Black Christmas&quot; at least once.  Kidder is great as Barb, a drunken and foul-mouthed sorority sister.  We also develop a great concern for the characters in this film.  If anything, Bob Clark's film definitely succeeds in one area where John Carpenter largely failed in &quot;Halloween&quot;: Realism.  The forever unidentified villain of &quot;Black Christmas&quot; is much more frightening than the Michael Myers character of &quot;Halloween.&quot;  The Michael Myers character is so superhuman that viewers know they would never actually encounter such a character in real life.  The hysterically shrieking and giggling obscene phone caller in &quot;Black Christmas,&quot; however, is VERY real.  Such psychotics and perverts exist in the real world.  In this respect, &quot;Black Christmas&quot; is far creepier than &quot;Halloween.&quot;  Today, in an era of DNA-based criminal evidence as well as Caller ID and other efficient phone number-tracing systems, this movie is probably not quite as scary, but definitely SHOULD HAVE sent a chill up the spine of any 1970s-viewer who received an obscene phone call at some point in their lives.Despite its weaknesses, every horror fan should see &quot;Black Christmas&quot; in its entirety at least once.

676517,"To those of you who were reading the other rviews, the review titled, &quot;PR dept. hard work.....&quot; is completely wrong.  They were not testing for alternate endings.  The whole story is based upon the greek myth of Orpheus.  You can tell by watching the movie that that story is loosely parallel.  Secondly, before I talk about the movie as a whole I will tell you why, I believe there are pop songs in a movie based in Paris during 1900.  In the movie it talks about the Bohemian Revolution.  People that participated in the revolution were called bohemians.  Bohemians wrote in the style, going in the whole idea of the revolution, of reminiscing about youth experiences, making things that were unique and groundbreaking, they tested the edges of acceptability, and rarely, if ever, gave credit to things of the future.  The writers picked Moulin Rouge as the place where the story was set because it was in the past and didn't give them any reason to give credit to a place of the future.  The pop songs are in it because the writers are reminiscing of songs from their youth, even some of its audience's youth.  This combination of pop songs in 1900 tests the edges of acceptability, and it is so well put together that it is unique and groundbreaking.  Now, this movie is so wonderful!  I went and saw this movie even without knowing anything about the plot except Nicole Kidman is a hooker in a nightclub and falls for a penniless writer (Ewan MacGregor).  I think it was much better that way.  The musical numbers are terrific, especially Tango de Roxanne(in which the tension bulids every layer of the song, I had no idea that music could add so much to a movie), and the rendition of Come What May at the end of the movie.  Many people say that the way Nicole and Ewan fall in love is stupid.  They have barely met and Ewan sings Your Song and Nicole falls straight in love with him.  Yeah it's kind of dumb, but hey, all musicals are like that, if you were expecting Silence of the Lambs you're out of luck, but if you were expecting an amazing love story you're in for a treat.  Once you get past when they first fall in love, this movie is a gem!  Those of you who are still skeptical, it is a knid of melodrama, and it's a romance, and it's a tragedy, it's so many things!

120882,"Clint Eastwood has a little pop-culture fun in this somewhat cartoonish Dirty Harry outing. ""The Dead Pool"" (1988) is a slight improvement over the unpleasantness of ""The Enforcer"" and ""Sudden Impact,"" but Inspector Harry Callahan no longer resembles the cinematic icon depicted in director Don Siegel's 1971 classic. Still, we get an inventive car chase, a few memorable Clint one-liners, and a stronger-than-average cast (Liam Neeson, Patricia Clarkson, Evan C. Kim, Jim Carrey). Running only 91 minutes, the film moves at a good clip until stumbling at the finish line. It's a ludicrous climax as Harry blows away his final psychopath with a hand-held harpoon gun. Though a commercial success, ""The Dead Pool"" lacked the box-office firepower of its predecessors and Eastwood wisely bid adieu to his most famous character.",N/A

The gov't decided to build a robotic Godzilla, using the original '54 Godzilla bones, to defend Japan from Godzilla.  The battle scenes are decent.  Kiryu knows how to kick butt and obvisiously Godzilla just takes it without putting up too much of a fight.

626374,"""Collateral"" delivers an interesting story with a tight pace, with some intense action sequences. It has good acting but does not delve too deep into its characters. And we wouldn't expect it too, because the whole story takes place in the course of one night. However, the cast of characters does make enough interesting revelations about themselves as the movie progresses to keep the plot moving along.The best part I thought was the action. Tom Cruise plays ""Vincent"", a contract assassin who has the good looks of a GQ male model, the suave intellectual capacity of a business negotiator (at one point he dishes out an impromptu jazz trivia about where Miles Davis went to school to learn music), and the deft killing skills of a Navy Seal. There's a really cool scene where he takes out a battalion of bodyguards, cops and hitman in a dance club to finally execute his target. Jamie Foxx is convincing at playing a cabbie going about his daily doldrums, and is gradually pushed past the border of sanity by his involuntary role in a killing spree. He eventually reacts to it in the most heroic and unthinkable way. Foxx is good in this movie, but I'm not sure if he's Oscar-good.This movie gave me a vibe like ""Training Day"", where characters are forced into a situation together, and people begin to reveal themselves bit by bit, as they are not really whom they seem to be. Eventually you know someone is going to be pushed to act totally beyond their normal behavior. The action is intense and tight here too, and definitely kept me at the edge of my seat.  3 & 1/2 Stars.",Collateral

It's a sci-fi action/horror movie that is extremely atmospheric and suspenseful. The story is an intriguing one, though not entirely different from other storylines you might find in similar movies or video games: Some of the crew of a deep-space transport vessel awake to find that something is very wrong with the ship and its crew. Systems are malfunctioning, many of the operational staff are either dead or missing, and somthing on the ship is hunting them. They realize that they have precious little time to get the ship's reactor functional again before they completely lose all power and hope of survival. Of course, there are many obstacles and hidden dangers in their path andnobody completely trusts one another.Like I said before, it's a tense, mysterious movie that most sci-fi fans will probably enjoy.

286815,"(The following contains very slight spoilers)Those films which were based on novels during Hollywood's golden age typically made huge changes from the original texts, very often with little of the original story remaining. And this picture is par for the course; oh, it's still recognisable as Jane Austen's story, but it can't be said to be a faithful adaptation in any way. (In fact, this script isn't actually based on the book itself; it's an adaptation of a stage play that was based on the book.) As an example of the changes made----the story was updated to the early Victorian era and the bulk of the plot has been pared to the bone or scrapped entirely to fit the tale into a two-hour running time. While the story is moderately faithful to the source material at the beginning (though simplified for time constraints), it runs off the rails about fifty minutes in and from there goes its own way, culminating with the surprising revelation, at the end, that Lady Catherine is secretly nice! (Shocking, I tell you!)Still, taken on its own terms as a cinematic experience, the film is enjoyable enough. The question is, why doesn't it bother me that such liberties were taken with the story in this 1940 version, when I was utterly disgusted and repulsed by the 2005 version for similar liberties? Well, perhaps it's because that, given the time period in which this film was made, I wasn't expecting a faithful adaptation in the first place. Also, this film does at least contain some of the comedy and wit of the novel; elements that are totally lacking in the 2005 version.So, don't look to this film for an faithful adaptation of the original story; it's more to be enjoyed for the cast of well-known golden age Hollywood actors who populate the major and minor roles. And so I'll give it a moderate recommendation for those who enjoy classic cinema.A couple addenda: MGM in-house composer Herbert Stothart wrote the music for this film. He was well-known for borrowing bits of classical music for use in his film scores (perhaps sometimes to excess), and here he used a piece from Modest Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" in the score. It's called ""Ballad of the Unhatched Chicks,"" and it's used as Mrs Bennet's theme song---this is actually rather amusing and a good fit for the character!The early Victorian-era costumes in this film are quite lavish and opulent---though of course completely different in appearance from the Regency clothing that would have been appropriate if the film's time period hadn't been changed. It simply isn't true, however, that costumes from ""Gone with the Wind"" were re-used in this picture (as has often been reported). Apart from the fact that the gowns make use of the crinoline, the style of the dresses in these two films is completely different .... (Though, it should be added, that the men's clothes don't quite match the women's in regards to time period; there really was no attempt made to perfectly recreate a very specific era.)This is a difficult one to rate---three stars seems a bit low, but I honestly didn't like it enough to give it four stars.",N/A

And then, every so often, Perlman drops in with an endearing scene, and some great lines.There's no great villain here.

The ball struck him just behind the ear and he fell like a log, dead.""In a letter to Missouri Governor Thomas Crittenden, Robert Ford uses the above excerpt to describe the fashion in which he murdered the infamous Jesse James, an act which is laboriously but nevertheless fantastically depicted in fledgling writer-director Andrew Dominik's ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"".""Assassination..."" is a slow draw, literally and figuratively.  The movie illustrates Robert Ford's childish admiration of the outlaw Jesse James and his desire to become a part of his now disintegrating gang, James looking to retire from a life of crime in the interest of raising his children with an honest living.  Worming his way into their last big heist, Robert (Affleck) and his brother Charley (Rockwell) become enticed by a $10,000 bounty placed on James's head and decide to cash in.  What they don't count on is mutiny on the bound in the form of Wood Hite, James's cousin and a cocky gunslinger whom is wary of Robert from the moment he appears.  Robert is viewed as a stain on the small band and when he and Wood begin to butt heads, a shoot out ensues, leaving Wood in need of a coffin.  Now out on the lam for a murder, Robert makes a deal with Missouri Governor Thomas T. Crittenden to be pardoned in exchange for the death of Jesse James.  Robert is only happy to do so, his reward not only monetary but his role as executioner of a well-known criminal paving the way for self-generated celebrity.  Oddly enough, once the deed is done, a reversal of roles takes place and Jesse, despite his nefarious reputation, is revered while Robert is scorned for his ultimate betrayal of a legendary figure.The film's lengthy title appropriately serves to represent its extensive duration.  At 2 hours and 40 minutes (the original cut was almost four hours - YIKES), half of who sit down to view it will be squirming in their seats and repeatedly checking their watches (or the counter on their DVD player).  Things do not happen quickly in this film and if it weren't for the performances from Affleck, Pitt and Rockwell and an excellent screenplay from director Andrew Dominik, it would be lost on most people (not to mention the inevitable incomplete viewings because someone fell asleep or just flat out turned it off because they became wearied by it all).  I am of the opinion that it could've used some serious offerings for the cutting room floor; as it is, some scenes are inexplicably long and there are so many pregnant pauses between bits of dialogue that you wish the producer(s) and/or editor(s) would've just cut to the chase instead of letting their actors linger, staring off into space as if they needed a cue.  This is by far the most bothersome feature when one views ""Assassination..."" and should be considered a warning to anyone who prefers movies that roll along at a productive pace.Other than the above complaints, there is a lot to be enjoyed and appreciated about ""Assassination..."", starting with Casey Affleck.  Affleck has found another interesting role this year, the first of which was a commendable performance in ""Gone Baby Gone"".  His portrayal of Robert's fear as well as inferiority to those around him are palpable; when confronted with the moment his ruse has been exposed to Jesse, his body literally sinks into a chair, face glistening from sweat and fighting off tears as he waits with a blanched face and his heart in his throat for his imminent execution.  It's that palpability that had him nearly winning an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor this year (he lost to Javier Bardem for ""No Country For Old Men"", indisputably deserved).  If he keeps playing his cards right, he'll become a better actor than his brother Ben will ever be (personally, I think he has already surpassed Ben in that department).  Perhaps it was meant to be that the elder of the Afflecks made the transition to the director's chair whilst Casey remains burned in the effigy of film, ergo the minds of audiences nationwide.Pitt has always been an iffy actor but the role of Jesse James seems to suit him and he plays the part well of a man torn by his conviction to protect his own best interests and a man whom is trying to make amends with the past.  There is also the implication that James is mentally disquieted, the victim of what could appear to some people to be frightening episodes of bipolar disorder.  James even so much as admits this to himself when he says, ""I haven't been acting correctly. I can't hardly recognize myself sometimes when I'm greased. I go on journeys out of my body and look at my red hands and my mean face and I wonder about that man who's gone so wrong. I've been becoming a problem to myself."" One minute he is maniacally laughing, the next he is staring off into the distance with glazed and melancholy eyes.  Pitt is spell-binding in a scene where James goes off the deep end, cackling wildly whilst quietly ruminating his inability to trust Ford - when he suddenly whips out a blade in a blind rage ready to slit Ford's throat, we see just how unpredictable and unstable James has become.  This scene only serves to validate his gang's growing fear and/or uncertainty of him and sheds light on the reason why his brother Frank (Shepard) parted ways with him.  In a time when mental disorders were little understood, this only serves to explain why James may have been the way he was and why he had become so dangerous to those who knew him.Sam Rockwell is a memorable supporting role as Charley Ford and despite his happy-go-lucky demeanor he is well aware of Jesse's savage temperament.  In the end, out of guilt and self-loathing, he spares himself of the disdain to which his brother Robert is subjected in the only manner he thinks is dignified and just.Shot largely in different parts of Canada, ""Assassination..."" was also well deserved of its Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography (cinematographer Robert Elswit won this for ""There Will Be Blood""), Roger Deakins capturing the simplistic beauty of Alberta's sprawling hills, fields and forests as well as its brutal but spellbinding winters.Bottom line: ""Assassination..."" really requires some patience on a viewer's part.  This virtue of virtues will be well rewarded by rich, complex performances by the film's leads and the whole of its supporting cast.",N/A

I'm usually a push-over for scary movies but this one really didn't have too many scare moments.

But sadly, the ending almost ruins the film. It takes one twist too many and ends in an almost different place.

1614888,"In my opinion this is a lesser Fritz Lang film but the Criterion BD gives a beautiful picture and good sound.Reading the Amazon reviews of this film is very enjoyable, one saying that Ray Milland puts him to sleep and another saying the only good thing about the film is Ray Milland's acting.The plot is convoluted, a bomb exploding in an apartment is one of the worst effects ever done in Hollywood and the contrived romance between the two leads is far fetched even by Hollywood standards.  The only suspense is the lead character trying to convince the police that what he says is true.So what is good about this film?  The acting is good (unless you hate Ray Milland) even though the plot can confuse the hell out of you with all the loose ends, but if you just let the film unwind and you go with the flow, it becomes an enjoyable spy picture.It seems that this picture was NOT a ""Fritz Lang picture"" in that he did not have complete control, others controlled the script, but even with that he did a good job of setting up the scenes and the lighting and photography are really good.

111107,"Stephen King's bestseller SALEM'S LOT is a surprisingly complicated novel that first presents a detailed portrait of normal life in a small New England town--normal life that is gradually perverted when the town becomes infested by the undead.  And with a cast that includes such memorable performers as James Mason, Lew Ayres, Elisha Cook Jr., and Marie Windsor, this 1979 two-part television special seemed to a great deal going for it.  Unfortunately, however, director Tobe Hooper and his screenwriters are unable to find a way to streamline the novel's numerous characters and subplots into any dramatic whole, and the result is a film that constantly references a host of characters, events, and ideas but seldom to any real effect.Even so, the film does have its charms.  Chief among them is James Mason in one of his final performances, offering a brilliant, sinister, and wickedly witty performance as Mr. Straker, the servant of the vampire.  Ayres and Bedelia are also extremely good, and although Cook and Windsor are largely wasted they are nontheless entertaining to watch.  And the film does offer a few ""jump in your seat"" thrills: the scenes of child vampires floating outside bedroom windows are truly creepy, and the great vampire himself harkens back to the silent film NOSFERATU in a most effective way.Still, most viewers will find the film fairly tame.  David Soul was not a memorable actor, the script is incredibly talky, and there are too many lose ends for the story to be satisfying.  It will be of most interest to fans of King's work who would like to see how television handled this, one of his most successful novels.  A word of warning: there are two versions of this film.  The single video version is a condensation of the original, and it is virtually unwatchable.  Stick with the full-length, two-tape version.",N/A

1598011,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (but hopefully not too many major ones).DISCLAIMER: I do actually like this show and plan on sticking with it, because I'm OCD and must see things through to the end. That being said, every show has a bad season - Buffy had the snooze-fest of season four, Angel had the truly terrible baby plot line in season three, Smallville had a dull-as-dishwater-Zod in season nine, and ... well, this is TVD's bad season. (I hope, because it's a mess and I'd hate to sit through another one.) The thing is, when the show is good, it's really good, and when it's bad, it's incredibly bad.Watching this season reminded me of reading ""Breaking Dawn."" It started out promising then turned into total crap, but I kept reading hoping for the EPIC RESOLUTION that would make up for 500 pages of self-defeating, totally illogical bull that preceded it. Lo and behold, instead of an epic resolution, I got 40 pages of pontificating and vampires standing around glaring at each other, before everyone went home; a big buildup, the promise of epic violence, and ... no payoff.In a nutshell, this is how season four of ""The Vampire Diaries"" plays out: a promising start, an epic build-up, some decent character moments, the threat of deathly peril and then... total crap. Not only is the pacing way off (long gone are the days of the series actually being creepy, and having episodic cliffhangers), it breaks all its formerly-established ""vampire rules,"" spends way too much time on unimportant things and not enough on its villain, introduces pointless characters for one or two episodes rather than using and developing existing ones, and the finale, while ""good,"" is so rushed, I felt most of it SHOULD have been a three or four episode arc at the end of the season.The wasted opportunities this season are endless, particularly the finale: the writers bring back a bunch of vengeful hybrids, werewolves, vampires, and dead witches, and you don't really see them DO ANYTHING BAD in town! Where's the hell-raising Kol promised us? Where's him capturing Elena and torturing her for days? Where's Klaus having to face down his twelve angry, undead, can't-be-killed hybrids? It's a MAJOR LET DOWN, and worse, a missed opportunity. Sadly, it didn't shock me because the entire season is like that.Breaking established ""rules of the universe"" in a series (or book, for that matter) is lazy, sloppy, and convenient, the epitome of bad writing. Here, they do it multiple times - baby vampires get the upper hand on much older ones (including an Original), a hybrid-werewolf baby is conceived, the sire bond isn't as rare as they said, and for that matter, neither are doppelgangers. Relationships are convenient rather than developed; characters are underused; consistently, the writers promise us something great and fail to deliver. Kol promises us hell on earth if Silas is freed - it never arrives; Klaus promises vengeance for Kol - it doesn't happen; Klaus swears vengeance on Tyler - and does nothing.None of the originals care when one of them is killed - and Elijah even goes so far as to comfort his brother's murderer, with nary a mention of his senseless death (and no, the show's justification is invalid, since there's a witch in Mystic Falls capable of stopping Kol). The writers then have him turn around a few episodes later and spend half of an episode trying to convince Klaus how important it is to preserve family. (WUT?)Granted, it all doesn't suck, and the first half of the season is even good. There's a few standout episodes, such as the aftermath of the Jeremy plot twist. Klaus' presence in the Christmas episode is unforgettable. Elijah continues to be fabulous, particularly when turning up in New Orleans. Damon and Elena have a nice moment together in the finale. Plus, it included the pilot episode for ""The Originals,"" which between Elijah (who, me, biased? Never!) and Marcel (who out-awesome-s Klaus by ten million miles) may be a lot of fun next fall.Will I be watching it next season? Yes. I didn't give up on Buffy, Angel, or Smallville after their crappy seasons.

When Sarah, a young wife (Jones) encounters the local preacher (Isaacs) and a sheriff (Harris) who isn't totally sane. When she refuses the preacher's advances her life is forever changed. Now with the help of the sheriff she sets out for revenge, and you know what they say about a woman scorned. I am a huge Ed Harris fan and I like westerns but lately the genre has been in a huge nose dive so I wasn't sure what to expect from this. This is easily one of the better ones that have come out lately but it is still a little slow moving. 90% of the reason this is good is the cast. Harris is good in everything, Isaacs is the most disturbing preacher since Michael Parks played one in Red State. The gem of the movie though is January Jones. For once she isn't just the eye candy of the movie, she actually has a needed part and the fact that it is her that loses it and goes on a killing spree makes it that much more interesting. If you are a western fan this is one to watch. Don't expect something like Open Range though, this is more like Appaloosa or 3:10 To Yuma or for you real movie fiends out there, if you liked Seraphim Falls you will like this. Overall, started off slow but really picked up and by the end you are glad you watched it. One of the better westerns in the last few years. I give it a B.",N/A
1659478,"KILL YOUR DARLINGS seemed like the film for me out of all the slop I've seen released thus far in 2014. Imagine, an old Beatnik like me, acquaintance of Allen Ginsberg, huge fan of Daniel Radcliffe--and here's a biopic about Ginsberg, played by Radcliffe. DREAMLAND! ... I was right and wrong ....Well, to be blunt and sweet: the film hits all the right notes as an artistic/period production. There is something missing--Capotewas suffused with it (see my review), this wasn't--but what there is leaps out pleasantly. Set at the time when a young Ginsberg was just off to Columbia, the remainder of this is not so impressive. It is, to be perfectly frank, a huge bore except for the stunning performances.Radcliffe is growing as an artist, and I would expect to see him in something like this at this stage of his career. The problem is, this film should have been about theHowl and Other Poems (City Lights Pocket Poets, No. 4)trial, and about far more important things than it presents. Many will disagree with me: a reviewer must press on. This film is trivial, a showcase for some pretty faces (plus a woefully miscast Jack Kerouac).The story here, that of Lucien Carr's commission of murder, is one I know vaguely and did not want to know about any further. Hence the idea I always had that any film about Ginsberg would concentrate first onHowl, and Other Poems, then on the characters. This film is a yes-no proposition for me and I will be even more honest: I refused to watch any more of it after about 90 minutes or a bit less. I'd had enough, even Radcliffe's presence being unable to sustain me any longer.Get it if you must; there is no other film quite like it and as I said, it has value. Perhaps I am missing something and it is a great film ... but it will never be a classic, nor do I think it will even be remembered except as another Radcliffe jumping-off point.",N/A

But &quot;Evolution&quot; is still a great fun romp, combining a decent science fiction story with some excellent comedic elements.The story combines all the classic elements of any Reitman comedy, be it Ghostbusters, Stripes or whatever. There's the three buddies, the girl, the blustery politician and of course the evil general. So yes, it's a bit formulaic. But the aliens are wonderfully imaginative, the pacing is good, and the three leads work well together. The Duchovney/Jones teaming works well, and Julienne Moore shows a nice talent for physical comedy.So while perhaps not one of Reitman's best works, Evolution is still a fine bit of entertainment.",Evolution
1188931,"The first few episodes of this show I was not so sure I liked it to much. Well I did like it but I like most anything with vampires in it, but all in all the show seamed to me to try to hard to be shocking and cool (and doing this by having characters have sex all the time) not that I mind sex or even graphic sex in a TV show or movie but when there is several long sex scenes in about every episode I start wondering why I did not just pick up a porn movie in the first place. However a little bit into the season the show do get better, the storyline and the characters pick up.The show have some very good and interesting characters, and some who are not so much. The premise of the show is that a few years into the future vampires have stepped forward and declared their presence. They have now become a part of society, partly due to the fact that they drink tru blood, artificial blood. Society is in an uproar over the vampires, some welcoming them and some wanting them hunted down and killed. In some way the show is similar to Alienation in that you have these supernatural creatures which try to become a part of society but there is forces working against that both in human society and inside the supernatural society. Now as often happens in these vampire shows one of the undead fall in love with a human girl. In this case a psychic blond redneck named Sookie. The show is about these two and their relationship as well as the pepole around them and their reactions to vampires suddenly being a part of society.I found True Blood to be an enjoyable show. I however do think that it at times is to redneck and try to hard to be trashy. At times I would love to see a character who do not live in a trailer or a house so run down it is surprising it do not fall a part and who actually have a bit off class. But I do not know, perhaps it is just me being snobby. Anyway True Blood is a good show if you like vampires and it have some interesting plot twists, it is definitely worth watching.",True Blood: Season 1
1018071,"Do we really need a 2 disc collection with Clerks II? I remember watching the making of Clerks II and other special features about the movie. Kevin Smith sure likes to talk about how he wrote his script in Las Vegas on his laptop within a week. Granted, Kevin Smith is not known for making big budget disasters. He seems content on making low budget, goofball offensive comedies like Clerks.His first Clerks was an awakening about reality with a largely unknown cast of characters. Some of whom were friends and relatives of Smith's like his mother who played the milk maid. In this sequel, Dante and Randal's relationship (a platonic friendship and nothing more) is tested when Dante announces that he's moving to Florida with his hot fiance, Emma. In the day of a life at Mooby's, Randal has a final going away party with interesting results.Now I don't mind a two disc collection if the film had been considered a classic or revolutionary. Sometimes, I think the two disc collection here is over-rated. Kevin Smith does love his fans and appreciates them but I think he talks and smokes too much. He's not daring enough as a film-maker in order to grow.This film showed an ending and resolution to Clerks but Kevin Smith needs to grow as a director and writer in his own way. He likes complete control which is something that keeps him away from the studios. He likes his creativity but he needs to grow and search for the next project. He has made good movies like Chasing Amy, Jersey Girl, and even Dogma (one of my favorites).This two disc collection would be great for all Kevin Smith fans but I would have liked to have seen some of the original players like Marilyn Ghigliotti and those who appeared in the first film again.",Clerks II

Ingrid Pitt still holds a Hottest Vampire spot for COUNTESS DRACULA and THE VAMPIRE LOVERS (available on a double-feature DVD with her commentary, btw).Back then, I'd always heard about two extremely erotic vampire films (for that time) but could never find them.  One was VAMPYRES, which has been released on DVD, and now, finally, we can get THE VELVET VAMPIRE.  Great cinema?  Not really.  Pioneering erotic horror?  You betcha.Celeste Yarnell, a Sixties hottie, plays the vampire here--and she's worth getting this DVD.  Her credits include a Star Trek episode and a scene with Elvis in LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE (she's the babe he's luring from a party while singing ""A Little Less Conversation""--a song that would reach #1 in Britian and the USA as a remix in 2001!).  She's incredibly sexy in this role, which is a major eye-opener for anyone who wondered how she looked ""au natural"" after all of her previous mainstream stuff.This film is very much a product of its time (and its eroticism was very much ahead of its time) so it holds a lot of charm and nostalgia for anyone who either lived then or has an interest in that period of horror filmmaking.",N/A

Releasing 63 films in the last 13 years, he's certainly a busy man, and he does his best to make some of the most bizarre movies out there, this being no expection.The first problem with this DVD is the actual DVD.It has no DVD Menu, no Sound options (Japanese Stereo + English Subtitles), and no extra features. The movie does have 3 trailers for other films which play right before the movie (Much like a VHS Tape). The video on the DVD Is nothing special either.The story follows young Riki (A model high school student), son of one of the biggest crime lords in japan, who murdered his other son (Riki's brother) -- Riki swears to avenge his brothers death, and recruits a group of bizarre people from his school (Including a man known as the japanese elvis!), to take out his father, and gain control of the Yakuza.The movie sounds real interesting (And when you see some of these characters (For instance, the girl who shoots poisonous darts out of her privates)), it truly is bizarre.Unfortunately the story doesnt unfold so well, and is a large letdown (I wanted to love this movie after hearing about it).It does feature Miike's typical ""over the top violence"" at parts, but its not as good as his typical films unfortunately.I'd recommend renting this one, but I'd hold off on purchasing this movie unless you can find it for under $10.",N/A
1636667,"In the beginning, Steven Soderbergh's alleged swan song SIDE EFFECTS is an expose of medical ethics and pharmaceutical abuse.  However, it mutates into a quirky murder mystery that employs lots of twists and deceptions.  Further plot nuances would involve spoilers that other reviews have  already done so, so I'll just discuss my feelings on the film's impact.I enjoyed the movie overall---it held my interest and the acting is competent if unremarkable.  I'm not a huge fan of Jude Law but he comes across convincingly.  Rooney Mara who came on so strong in GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO seems like an upper scale Katie Holmes.  Catherine Zeta Jones who always looks good is somewhat miscast as Mara's first shrink and Channing Tatum has little to do as the hapless murder victim.Soderbergh's penchant for sharp characterization is diminished by tepid pacing and unexpected predictability.

1449811,"Being an owner of almost two dozen Blu Ray 3D movie releases purchased in past year  I was always enjoying  each and every one of them on my 106"" projector screen and Optoma HD83 gear and latest Optoma BG-ZF2100GLS glasses. The announcement of Hobbit - a ""masterpiece"" as called by many reviewers made me believe this is going to be even more breathtaking movie experience I have ever seen so far. Long preorder wait rewarded with disk set arrival was supposed to exceed my expectations - but it didn't.Right from the start, the first seconds of the movie made me think there is something wrong with my gear as 3D picture seemed to be crisp and clear as usual but unusually stereoscopic where instantly I noticed unnatural depth of field which made my eyes tired just after few minutes of watching. This is the same effect when short sided person gets the glasses with bad eye pupillary distance. To eliminate or confirm gear issue I replaced the disk with three other 3D movies I watched in the past: I Robot, Avatar and Prometheus. All three confirmed there is nothing wrong with the gear showing perfect picture as usual without any eye related discomfort.I put back the Hobbit disk and the problem came back. I had to actually change the viewing distance and get further away from the screen to the back wall of my projection room to make viewing acceptable. This is very unusual move because so far the distance from the screen never mattered and watching 3D movies from any distance or any angle was always enjoyable without any flaws or discomfort.I followed the observation path of unnatural depth of field, and I have noticed that the actual amount of L-R picture shift is dramatically different comparing to other three movies I mentioned above.  The easiest way to check it is to turn on subtitles and check the relative shift between L and R frame by looking at the subtitle letters with the 3D glasses not used. I noticed that on Hobbit the shift is far greater comparing to other movies and this made confirmed my observation about unusually large depth of field on entire picture which could cause my eyes discomfort.Despite of the above, with apprehension and viewing discomfort I managed to watch entire 3D movie to the end. But I was disappointed that the actual BD transfer is bad and causes my eyes tired for the first time I watch 3D movie. Among many others I own, this is the first one and probably the last one in the Hobbit series - at least in 3D version.I  took a time and played 2D version disk and the picture was perfect, natural although two-dimensional. This is going to be version I will probably enjoy with upcoming episodes of Tolkien Hobbit released on disk.I am just not sure how come director allowed releasing movie based on flawed transfer or authoring. The only explanation to this would be this was intentional. Not good for me, probably for some viewers either.",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

After being panned by critics, getting a 2% rating on rottentomatoes.com, and flopping at the box-office, I had no intention of ever seeing this movie. I happened to stumbled upon the DVD last week for under fifteen dollars and I noticed Life on Mars's Jason O'Mara was in it, so I thought I would give it a try. With no expectations, I actually enjoyed the movie for what it is, an innocent fluff despite the short running time of 91 minutes. Katherine Heigl is adorable and has a sparkling chemistry with Jason O'Mara. Debbie Reynolds steals every scene she is in. Now this movie is never going to win any Oscars with its plot, which has several holes, a not-so-great villain and a predictable ending. At times the movie feels less like a theatrical release and more like a television pilot, where it probably would have been more successful.

676414,"I have to agree with most `Techies that the `Southern Cross' chapter of the ROBOTECH saga is probably the weakest of the bunch. I found it a bit too cutesy at times, and the storyline often took severe leaps in logic that make some of the more implausible moments in other 80s `toonage seem down-to-earth. Also, due partly to the abrupt cancellation of the Southern Cross when it was originally broadcast in Japan, it ended without really developing most of the characters to the fullest. And whoever cast the voice actor who did the dub for Zor shoulda been made to suffer a slow and painful death! Still, it does have its moments. And when it comes to my fave shows on video, I'm a completist-- I just gotta have `em all!Much like the previous ROBOTECH eppies put on disc, the picture &amp; sound quality of this batch ain't that much better than what I used to see &amp; hear on VHS. But, at least the DVDs have more eppies per plateer than any of the VHS videos had per tape, making this series an amazing shelf-space saver. That, and I don't have to worry about degradation after endless viewings. So, at least there's a bright side to the situation.The bonus disc in this particular set contained a surprising addition: the first episode of the English-language rendition of `Macross' before it was incorporated into the Robotech saga and re-dubbed! Until now, the only way to get this rare piece of anime history was eBay for a legitimate VHS tape (VERY expensive!)  or the bootleg market. This pilot has the same voice actors in the same roles, and most of the original dialogue spoken here remained intact in the Robotech re-do. Also included are a few scenes that were eventually trimmed from the Robotech rendition. Unless you're a really observant viewer of the show, the restored parts may pass you by without a second thought!Also included are a few bits of media regarding the unreleased and largely-unseen `Robotech: The Movie', most of which didn't impress me all that much. Both the teaser trailer and music video (3 Dog Night's ""In My Heart"") weren't all that spectacular, and contained only `Southern Cross' footage that was cannibalized and stuck into the film. None of the cannibalized `Megazone 23' scenes are present. The Robotech movie animatic is basically the dialogue &amp; sound track from the end of the movie, with shots of the corresponding rough storyboard sketches. This little bit of anime proto-cinema is probably one of the only moments from the movie that'll ever see a legitimate video release. Don't feel too bad about this revelation, though-I've actually viewed `Robotech: The Movie', and believe you me, you're not missing out on much.Also included on the bonus platter are several sketches of various Southern Cross body armor &amp; transports that never made it into the finished series. Most of the body armor designs are reminiscent of Samurai uniforms &amp; the robots of M.S. Gundam. And, like the previous bonus platters, this one includes a few clips dubbed in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.`Late",Robotech - Masters - Legacy Collection 5

136570,"""Cyborg"" is an entry into Jean-Claude Van Damme's filmography that could not be made a second time. Only the second starring role in Van Damme's career, it was likely only during this desperate part of his Hollywood life that he would have willingly submitted himself to the creative whims of infamous director Albert Pyun. However, in all fairness, this is definitely one of the best features Pyun would ever make, and if nothing else, it's fun seeing the Muscles from Brussels in something as trashy and creatively reckless like this. This isn't one of Van Damme's more lauded pictures, but fans who can find beauty in imperfections ought to be entertained by this.The story: in a dystopian future, a mercenary for hire (Van Damme,Bloodsport) tracks down a ruthless pirate leader (Vincent Klyn,Point Break) attempting to destroy the last hope for humanity.I like to compare ""Cyborg"" here to the stylistically similarNemesis, another action vehicle Pyun directed some three years later. While the latter had better action content and had more fun with the concept of artificial humans, ""Cyborg"" is infinitely better made with stronger production values. Indeed, whereas most of ol' Albert's movies look like they've been shot on abandoned property or out in the wilderness, ""Cyborg"" benefits from sets that had famously been prepared for ""He-Man"" and ""Spider-Man"" films which were never produced. There's a good deal of color to the world, despite its post-apocalyptic state, so it's rarely dull to look at like a lot of the director's stuff. The acting really isn't great, particularly Vincent Klyn's, but there are a couple examples of effective silent acting between Van Damme and Deborah Richter (Promised Land).Again in comparison to ""Nemesis"", ""Cyborg"" has less action but that doesn't mean it's an insufficient amount. Additionally, the fight scenes are nicely varied: karate, knife-fighting, shootouts, and a couple explosions make for a well-rounded spectacle. All of the hand-to-hand scenes could definitely have been shot better and Van Damme is in definite need of more opponents to fight one-on-one, but the choreography is occasionally inventive, like when he performs a jumping reverse roundhouse to slice open a thug's neck with a nail protruding from his boot. Speaking of the need for more one-on-one villains, I was disappointed by how all of the creative-looking henchmen are automatically relegated to bit status: they include Ralf Moeller (Gladiator) and Stefanos Miltsakakis (Maximum Risk) among other weirdoes, but they're all virtual nobodies and crumble before Van Damme's kicks.I wish there could have been more of that cheesy, retro stop-motion you see early in the film and less slow motion, but with Pyun you can't ask for everything. ""Cyborg"" ends up being pretty tit-for-tat - not a must-have for Van Damme devotees, but an interesting excursion if you tire of his more kosher work. Me, I'm glad I finally got to see it, but it definitely doesn't merit a purchase. A rental will do.",N/A
228460,"The first 50 or so minutes of this film are terrific. The late Bruno Lawrence plays Zac Hobson, a scientist in New Zealand who wakes up one morning to find that everyone except him seems to have vanished from the face of the earth. We see him trying to cope with this state of affairs, going crazy and then slowly regaining his sanity while the world is silent around him. In these scenes, Lawrence gives a bravura performance which manages to stop short of hamming it up and really gets you caring about Zac's frail psyche. His descent and renewal are as gripping as any great moviemaking could be, done with only a few words, a few poignant gestures and deft editing and camerawork.Zac then finds out that he's not alone after all: first, a young woman named Joanne and then a burly Maori lorry-driver named Api find him and the three of them try to puzzle out why they're still on Earth and everyone else has vanished. It's at this point that the movie gets pretty soggy. There's a rather flimsy plotline about how an experiment funded by the big, bad USA somehow brought about this catastrophe, a love triangle that comes about just when you're hoping a love triangle WON'T come about, and an ending that smacks of the story petering out, as opposed to leaving you with tantalizing unanswered questions. So that's disappointing. But the first 50 minutes of THE QUIET EARTH are right up there with the first hour of THE BLACK STALLION, where the director uses all of the cinematic tools at his disposal to help you experience Zac Hobson's despair fully and completely.

You probably know by now that it is based on an actual occurences in an Arkansas town which makes it all the more interesting a story.From the first few opening shots, it is apparent by the great use of the 2:35 widescreen frame that whoever made this film had experience and know how.  Too bad the picture changes to full frame after the opening credits on the available releases.I will agree that the comic releif elements (Dukes of Hazzard Roscoe P Coltrane style humor)scattered lightly throughout the film are a bit out of place but this did not hamper the experience for me. I never found the acting to be bad and Ben Johnson is a very well accomplished actor who has been in probably hundreds of movies with some of the biggest names in the industry.A cool looking masked killer and documentary style make for worthwhile viewing.

333820,"What a wonderful film. Too bad it isn't an accurate portrayal of events. Errol Flynn and Ronnie Raygun are in fine form as Jeb Stuart and George Custer respectively, but John Massey steals the show masterfully as John Brown. The racism that bubbles under the surface is the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars. So entertaining is this picture that one could easily be lured into its fantasies, especially if you aren't educated in history. John Brown was no villain; he was a true American patriot who dedicated (and ultimately gave) his life to rid our land of genocide. The sense of forboding over the foundation being laid for our Civil War is palpable, but again, the film tends to mislead one into the conclusion that slavery, not preservation of the Union, was the motivating factor. That's acribing too much false nobility to many Unionists who could have cared less about abolishing slavery. So, enjoy the film, yes, but temper it with a  heavy dose of those dusty old history books. You may just learn something...and it may just change your opinions of political events unfolding before us today.",N/A

349572,"Fledgeling vampire Michele has given in to her bloodlust to join Radu in an unholy alliance, but Michele's sister Becky will not allow her to cross over without a fight! BLOODLUST continues the SUBSPECIES vampire saga at its own leisurely pace, retracing many of the same plot points from the previous films but with far less success. It isn't without its moments, however. Michele's first attempt to lure her prey using her new-found powers is highly atmospheric and brilliantly shot using only the most basic editing techniques as effectively as possible. The contrast between Denise Duff's pale beauty and Anders Hove's sinister, rat-like appearance set against their dark surroundings also makes for a number of striking images. Their sexual tension continues to grow as they push and pull away from one another in a game of cat and mouse. Although it takes a step down from the second film, fans of the series are still sure to enjoy this third entry.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Bloodlust - Subspecies 3 VHS

755823,"This DVD is a faithful screen adaptation of the book ""Gods and Generals"", by Jeffrey Shaara.  It deals with the very beginnings of the American Civil War and progresses through the battle of Chancellorsville.  The book (and movie) are part of a three-part trilogy on the Civil War.  The movie is produced by Ted Turner, who makes a small cameo appearance as a southern soldier. This movie is a prequel to the 1993 hit ""Gettysburg"".The movie (like the book) centers on the major generals of the war, Robert E. Lee (played to a ""tee"" by Robert Duvall), General ""Stonewall"" Jackson (excellently played by Stephan Lang), and the union's Lt. Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (played by the very capable Jeff Daniels).  Of course, the leadership on each side believes in and prays to a God that they hope will deliver them victorious, thus the title ""Gods and Generals"".While the movie has sweeping visuals and equisitely accurate battle sceens, the movie is simply too long at nearly 4 hours in length.  Proper editing would have resulted in a more enjoyable film.  Too much time is allowed for elegant proseic speeches by the generals, generally to their wives.  The movie really bogs down in these sections and one is tempted to fast forward past them to the action that lies ahead.The actors do a remarkable job; all are believable and truly become the character(s) they portray.  The battle scenes are the film's strength and are an eye-opener for anyone not familiar with the bloody brutality of the Civil War, our nation's bloodiest conflict.  The courage of the soldiers facing an 800-yard march across an open field being pounded by cannon fire is something to behold.  The historical accuracy of the film is also a draw, as it teaches Civil War history.I believe the average viewer will tire of this movie due to its excessive length.  However, the Civil War buff will revel in the great detail and the effort to make the film historically accurate.  The film is appropriate for all but the youngest members of the family, as some of the killing is graphic.  I doubt that children will be able to watch the film to its conclusion, as they will lose interest in the non-battle scenes.With proper editing, this could have been a 4 or 5-star movie.  The best I can give it is a 3-star rating due to its length.Jim Konedog Koenig",N/A

Caine and Moore -- usually not one of my fave actresses -- give top-notch performance, and the supporting cast is also fabulous (esp. Wilson, of course), enough for me to have watched this several times. The heist plot itself (supposedly loosely based on ""true events"" from the 60s) is brilliant.However, I cannot give the film a higher rating because I must blame the filmmakers for including way too many cliched moments, from the incompetent security guard to an old man doing the impossible (and doing it many times) to ""making the world a better place"" message. And the 100 million pound sterling question is not that hard to figure out, if you've watched a lot of robbery films.

126756,"15 years after crafting the low budget comic cult classic Escape From New York, director John Carpenter finally got the budget he needed in this sequel/reworking of the original film.  Kurt Russell reprises his role as one eyed badass Snake Plisskin as he is dropped into the island of Los Angeles to seek out the president's daughter.  Parts of the film seem more aimed to make a social satire of our dwindling freedom, but sometimes the action gets too incoherent and parts of the film seem uneven.  Not to mention that there are times when the film feels rushed, like Carpenter just wanted to get the film over with.  Either way though, Escape From L.A. is still a fun B-movie ride with a great comic flair, and the great supporting cast which includes Steve Buscemi, Pam Grier, Peter Fonda, Stacy Keach, Cliff Robertson, and B-movie icon Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell make this one of Carpenter's more decent films of late.",N/A

1444980,"Other reviewers have mentioned the 'grain' was added for theatricality, but it is just annoying. Especially when the Blu-Ray costs more. So just stick to the DVD version instead and save some money.And in other news, I read that some folks compare this to Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell and that is really not accurate. I could see it being closer to Ghost in the Shell than Blade Runner. But I am a huge fan of both films and this falls short of those on nearly every account. Plus I watch a ton of sci-fi and dystopian anime, even series not widely available in the states, and this is merely passable compared to much.The series seems to start off good enough, but then it fizzles out and doesn't really seem to recapture any steam. The characters seem to all be very flat archetypes without any real development, or any real draw for the viewer. Plus the 14 year old looking heroine is naked a lot. Not so much of a problem in Ghost in the Shell with the obviously adult Motoko, but in this I felt uncomfortable, like a peeping pedophile.There are a lot of adult themes but often it seems they are included just to 'grow up' the series. It's not worth watching if you are into deep and complex stories. I would say to check out the film and series for Ghost in the Shell if you haven't. Also Darker than Black is a good series with a dark spin. And there is always Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head. Even No.6 was better and I wasn't too keen on that series either (it was too short and the plot didn't have enough time to develop).There are better series out there, so just be aware before you buy this. Perhaps checking it out first on Netflix would be preferable. I was able to get the Blu-Ray from my local library so luckily I didn't plop $30 on this. And please don't hate me for this review, I would probably give it 3 stars except that the Blu-Ray version is pretty pointless with the grainy resolution (which I'm not sure was intentional - even the black background on the opening credits is horribly grainy).And also of note: this was based on a novel (which is available at my library) so I am thinking the novel might be much better than the anime.

514322,"Probably the pick of the Jaws style thrillers that remerged a few years back, attempting to capture the suspense of the Shark flick, with more inventive special effects.The movie sports a pretty good cast, including Samuel L Jackson as a rich investor, and Saffron Burrows as the hard nosed and dedicated physician attempting to find a cure for Alzheimer's by using Shark brain fluid. Sounds cheesy, but the plot actually supports itself quite well and is at least plausible, if a little improbable. The story centers around an isolated marine facility with a skeleton crew that you just know are going to get into problems, and sure enough the picture moves quickly into an escape adventure, when the hunters (or scientists) become the hunted. Another complaint is the casting: the director seems to have felt the need to cover all the bases with stereotype characters, which really wasn't necessary.* The aging and unkempt heavy smoking scientist* The sexy young, ruthless bossy woman* The religious guy* The handsome hunky hero with a shady past* The successful financial investor, who's also athletic and a born leader* The soft spoken other female with an active but sensitive side* The brainy guy who's a bit of a wimp, but comes through in a clutchThis is no Jaws however, with none of the grace or depth of the Spielberg classic, and spends far too much time trying to wow the audience with the ferociousness of the initially caged lab experiments. After they get loose we are treated to some gory attack scenes but this is where the movie really suffers. Watching this on the small screen really shows up the CGI and at times the sharks looks so fake, they almost appear as cartoons. Lightning fast attack sequences don't help this either, and the whole thing starts to look very artificial.This isn't a BAD picture, and there are one or two twists in the plot, and scenes to make you jump which help lift the story in places, but it is WAY TOOOOO predictable overall.Worth a look, but you probably won't pause it while you put the popcorn on!

1015377,"Road to Guantanamo is a movie about the inhumane conditions inflicted on three Muslim men who spent almost three years at the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba. This movie is part drama and part documentary. The majority of the film uses dramatizations of the actual events with actors playing three Muslim Englishmen and the military personnel who capture them. The remaining parts of the movie include actual interviews with the three guys and some archive footage of Donald Rumsfeld, George W. Bush, and others.Directors Michal Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross attempt to tackle a very large, controversial subject with Road to Guantanamo and rather than stick to the usual documentary formula of expert testimony, archive footage, and interviews, they decided to try something a little different. Using actors, this docu- drama attempts to let the outside world see what conditions are like inside Guantanamo Bay. The prisoners who suffer at the hands of the military personnel number far more than Asif, Ruhal, and Shafiq. Like the dramatizations show, most everyone at this military base was subject to daily doses of humiliation, physical pain, and mental torture as different captors tried to extract confessions of guilt from the three men and those around them.Among the scenes in this movie, the ones that are most memorable are those taken at prison (a dramatization- it wasn't really filmed there). Watch in disgust as the military people rough up uncooperative prisoners; force the men to sit in physically uncomfortable positions; force the men to listen to loud, blaring music; deny them of their right to pray each day; etc. And, of course, there was plenty of dishonesty on the part of the military personnel when it came time to interrogate. Why was all of this done? To try to get one or all of the men to confess to having some involvement in the Al Qaeda led attacks on September 11, 2001, or to at least obtain some information about Osama Bin Laden and where he might be hiding. Most viewers will find this part of the film moving, regardless of whether or not they agree with this type of interrogation. Personally, I don't like the way things are handled when it comes to POW's and interrogation but, on the other hand, this is war and during war you cannot always be nice and friendly to your captives, especially when you are trying to get information from them that could lead to the arrest of a known killer.This docu- drama is intended to illustrate the horrors of war and the human rights abuses that often take place when prisoners of war are interrogated. It fulfills its task effectively in some ways but not in others. The scenes taken from the prison are among the best in the film, even if they are performed by actors, because they let the world see what it was like to spend time in these prisons as an innocent person. I know that many have denied the human rights abuses at Guantanamo Bay but I think what this docu- drama portrays is pretty accurate. The reason I say this is because the conditions depicted, while nasty and certainly undesirable, are not nearly as bad as they could be and they don't come close to the torture inflicted on POW's in other countries. In other words, I don't think anyone can say that the alleged conditions displayed in this movie are exaggerated. They seem to be right on the mark and while they are nothing to be proud of, they are not as horrifying as the stories told by POW's from other wars, like Vietnam.As far as the viewpoints offered, Road to Guantanamo doesn't offer a balanced picture by any stretch and this should come as no surprise to anyone since the goal of this docu- drama is to gain sympathy for these three innocent men (and others like them) who lost nearly three years of their lives in a military prison. But this lack of any balance is one of the movie's downfalls. Not only is there no counter argument from military personnel, there is no commentary from any one else except the three men themselves. It is nice that these three men are willing to come forward and offer their take on the brutality of war but the movie would have been much more effective if it included at least some commentary by others; like, say, human rights experts, political analysts, military experts, etc. The viewing public fully expects the three men who were held captive to have nothing but negative things to say about the experience. We expect that. But it takes more than one side to make a documentary of this type believable and the filmmakers should have expanded the movie to include commentary from others as further proof of the film's conclusions.Another thing I'm not too happy with about Road to Guantanamo is the DVD; specifically, the lack of extras. The only things you get on the DVD are a scene selection option, previews, and other usual things you get on all DVD's. Here, once again, the directors blew a golden opportunity. The movie makes you want to know more about this controversy and the directors could have fulfilled that curiosity and added to the film's credibility with some educational DVD extras. But they don't offer anything to satisfy the viewer's cravings for more information.The three men portrayed in this documentary did win release from prison in 2004 and the charges were dismissed. They each maintained their innocence which was later proven true. They kept their spirits throughout this time of injustice and they have now emerged stronger than ever. Each of the men talks at length on this documentary about the experience and they claim that their personal character and Muslim faith are now impenetrable thanks to the negative experience at Guantanamo Bay.Overall, Road to Guantanamo is a pretty good film with an important message about POW and the proper way to treat them. It is very one- sided and inconsistent and it falls short of the great documentary it could have been because of its lack of expert testimony and other persuasive/educational material. But it is still a good documentary/drama about the horrors of life as a POW and it is worth a watch.",N/A

949974,"Only in the postmodern era could a film of such content achieve notoriety as a ""horror film"".  ""Emily Rose"" is more an exercise on the ins and outs of religious faith within the framework of the American legal system than a horror movie, an interesting meditation on how belief in the metaphysical goes over in complicated situations like the tragic one depicted here. Having read about the actual case which really took place in Germany and did not for a second involve the Catholic Church, I thought it was a little distasteful that the director decided to suggest here and there that this might have been a real case of possession.As far as the movie itself goes, though, the meticulous construction and ill-fated plight of Emily Rose (Anneliese Michael) manages to entertain and even get a tad spooky here and there.  Needless to say, this only happens when the fictitious elements are added.  It is above all worth watching as a courtroom drama.  Tom Wilkinson is utterly forgettable as Father Moore and Jennifer Carpenter delivers a fairly convincing performance as Emily Rose in both her ""normal"" state and ""possessed"" state.Laura Linney and Campbell Scott, however, are phenomenal as two lawyers bent on both stealing the spotlight and proving each other wrong.  At times you really can't help but side with the prosecution, though, as Linney is clearly unprepared for the case despite her character's supposed voracious drive for victory.  How you could pull off an even tentative acquittal such as the one Moore receives at the end is beyond me in this particular case, but she manages it.For my part, I was not left with the desire to watch the film again and again.  Although the plotline was elaborate, coherent and gripping, I found the ""exorcism"" scenes ridiculously short and unconvincing.  What you are left with here is not a burning question as to whether Emily was really possessed or just epileptic, but tremendous pity for her psychological and physiological suffering.That said, this is worth watching.  Maybe some aspiring horror director will pick up on the good parts and make another actually frightening film about exorcism.",N/A
515348,"Inspired by Sergio Leone's ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, another Italian Sergio (Corbucci) keeps the genre popular worldwide with this violent but fun film.  Starring a young (23) blue-eyed stud with a shortened name of Franco Nero, the movie is pretty simple and follows the Leone formula.Django (Nero) walks throughout the film dragging a coffin behind him using an attached rope.  We don't know what happened to his normal transportation.  Filmed in Italy and Spain, the setting is the U. S. /Mexican border just after the Civil War.  Django is a former Union soldier (still wears the yellow striped pants) headed for a small town on the Mexican side.  Along the way he finds a woman who is being beaten by a handful of Mexicans.  After dispatching them quickly with his six-shooter, another group of horsemen arrive.  These are Americans but wear red scarves or hoods, suggesting an element of the Klan.  They suffer a fate similar to the Mexicans.Django takes Maria (Loredana Nusciak) with him into town.  Django's goal is to avenge his wife who died at the hand of one of the equally evil group of bad guys.  Either the Mexican revolutionaries led by Gen. Rodriguez (Jose Bodalo) or more likely, the red KKK dudes and their leader Maj. Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo).  Jackson is so evil that he dispatches young Mexicans one at a time to run up a hill, before shooting them with his rifle as target practice.  While Django is adept with his handgun, he only has one and it only has six bullets.  So to everyone's surprise he invites Jackson to bring his 40 member gang into town for a final shootout.  Naturally Django has a surprise waiting.Corbucci who wrote the story as well as directed the film, is brutal with his confrontations.  Kids are killed, ears are severed and hands are crushed along with the unusually severe beatings.  Keeping with the times of 1966, it's not overly gory, but would surely earn an ""R"" rating, even today.  The film has plenty of logic-distancing scenes as well as some continuity issues.  And there are some noticeable blunders that might leaving one shaking their head.  Still, considering the budget and the scope, ""Django"" is a film worth seeing if you are a Western film aficionado.  ""Django"" continued on with several sequels and was fondly remembered by filmmaker Quinton Tarantino as evidenced by his 2012 film ""Django Unchained"" which featured a brief cameo by Nero.The Blu ray adaptation has some problems but is overall well done.  The film begins with an optional introduction by Nero and the following disclaimer: The print used was ""transferred from its original camera negative, which contained some intermittent age-related damage.""  And yes, it's pretty evident.  There are a couple incidents of a pause between scenes.  In other cases, the picture fluctuates from scene to scene.  There is some unusually heavy grain in evidence in some frames.  Having said all that, at least they told us.  And in reality, most of the film looks very good.  Excellent color, good detail and contrast.I wasn't exactly thrilled with the audio either.  We get two DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (1.0) tracks.  One is in the original Italian with English subtitles.  The other is an English dubbed version.  I watched the dubbed version for a few minutes but didn't like Nero's voice actor.  It also seemed like the translation didn't always make sense.  This was verified when I went over to the Italian and the subtitles were in fact different.  Neither audio version is all that strong in either case.  The film begs for a more immersive track.  Subtitles include English, English SDH, French and Spanish.Extras include an interview with Nero and asst. director Ruggero Deodato, a 10 minute film starring Nero called  'The Last Pistolero.'  There is also a 1968 documentary featuring several filmmakers about the ""Spaghetti Western Phenomenon.""",Django VHS

This match could have been better if Edge was wrestling, because Mysterio and Hardy had to carry most of, if not the entire match. Snitsky is dreadful in the ring, and Masters is still developing at this point. This is still a good opener that gets the crowd pumped up for the show. Rey and Matt put on good performances, and do some cool moves. Pretty good match, worth a watch. 6/102. Eugene & Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka vs. Rob Conway & Tyson TomkoPretty boring, considering none of these men, other then Superfly, are capable of putting on anything more then a snoozefest of a match. Conway is pretty limited, and Tomko and Eugene were never meant to be wrestling in the first place, and are simply awful. The only noteworthy spot of the match is Superfly getting tagged in to wrestle for about 15 seconds, then going off the top rope for the splash. The rest is poorly wrestled, bland, and boring. 2/103. Three Faces of Foley Match: Mankind vs. CarlitoI'm glad that the fans picked Mankind as the face of Foley to face Carlito, because Mankind had not been seen for quite some time in the WWE, and it was refreshing. Carlito is similar in that he is something new and different for the WWE, and he brings life to the ring when he steps in. He has great character, and his in ring skills, though not fantastic here, have greatly improved since. He is entertaining here, and him and Foley put on a good show. Short, but it was never meant to be a wrestling classic, just a fun match to keep the show moving. Both Foley and Carlito put on good performances. 7/104. World Tag Team Championship Match: Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch vs. Kane & Big ShowThis one suprised me, because I thought this would be boring and slow. At some parts it is, but it picks up in a few places, and is overall entertaining. It does its job by putting over Kane and Big Show as the new tag team on Raw, and they work well together. Cade and Murdoch hold this one down a little, but it doesn't hurt the match too much. Worth a watch. 6/105. Street Fight Match: Batista vs. Jonathan Coachman w/ Goldust and VaderI think the original plan was to have Austin face Coach, but that fell apart so instead the WWE picked the Animal himself to face good ol' Coach. Anyway, this is quite short and there really isn't much to this one, except for Coach getting beaten pretty badly. Basically a time filler, you can skip this and you won't miss much. 3/106. Fufill Your Fantasy Battle Royal Match for the Women's Championship: Trish Stratus (c) vs. Ashley vs. Candice Michelle vs. Mickie James vs. Maria vs. VictoriaThe fans decided that the Divas should wrestle the match in lingerie, and I am not complaining about that decision at all. Other then Victoria, this match is very ""easy on the eyes"" if you know what I mean, and isn't that bad. Trish and Maria make the match for me, this is certainly worth a watch for the lovely eye candy. 5/107. Steel Cage Match for the Intercontinental Championship: Ric Flair (c) vs. Triple HAs Joey Styles stated, this match was not really for the Intercontinental Championship, but was extremely personal. Triple H completed the demise of Evolution by beating his former best friend to a bloody pulp. Flair seeks revenge inside of the 15 foot high Steel Cage, and Triple H dominates a majority of this match. Flair comes back swinging, literally (you'll see what I mean), and escapes the cage after going through a brutal 24 minutes. He proves he can still wrestle one hell of a match, and this sets up their rematch at Survivor Series in a Last Man Standing Match, where Triple H is the one seeking revenge. A great match, these two click and make this one bloody, brutal brawl. 9/108. Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship: John Cena (c) vs. Kurt Angle vs. Shawn MichaelsCena really didn't have to do much in this match, because the fans voted HBK as the third man in this match, and when you put the Showstopper and the olympic gold medalist in the same ring, you're going to get a good, if not great, match. All three men put on good performances, and HBK and Angle continue their rivalry by taking out Cena with an announce table spot and fighting by themselves for a good 5 minutes. HBK proves that he deserved the fans votes for the second year in a row at this event, and all three men work very well here. Good match, everybody has chemistry together and this is one of Cena's best title defenses. 8.5/10Taboo Tuesday is better then the previous years' event, and is overall, a pretty good PPV. The undercard leaves a lot to be desired, but the uppercard is good. Two great matches and a few fun matches make this one worth watching.Match of the Night: The Steel Cage match: Ric Flair vs. Triple H. This is a bloodbath, but a damn entertaining one at that.

There are enough differences between the two to keep the copyright lawyers at bay. But I will say that there was a time when I was watching Pathology where the two movies are so similar that I paused the movie, pulled up my spreadsheet, and searched it to see if I'd seen the movie before and just forgotten about it. I hadn't, except for when it was called Anatomie. Now, I don't want you to take that to mean that Pathology is a bad movie; it's a capable little thriller, albeit one that goes for the cheap thrill too often. Just the kind of turn-your-brain-off-and-enjoy movie that hits the spot now and again.Plot: Ted Grey (Stay Alive's Milo Ventimiglia) is a new med school student specializing in forensic pathology. While he may have gotten into his prestigious school thanks to his fiancee Gwen (Buying the Cow's Alyssa Milano)'s father being a higher-up muckety-muck there, he's no slouch when it comes to figuring out cause of death. He's good enough at it, in fact, that he catches the eye of Jake Gallo (State of Play's Michael Weston), a resident with a terrifying drug habit. But that's not Jake's only dark secret; he's also the unofficial head of a small cadre of fellow residents whose extracurricular activities include wild partying and murdering people in inventive ways to see if they can fool the other members of the group vis-a-vis cause of death. Despite his misgivings, the puzzles fascinate Ted, and soon he is drawn into the group.There's nothing here you won't see coming a mile away. But then, when pretty much everyone in your movie is a killer, it's tough to get away with making your bad guys not seem bad. It's fun.

388429,"&quot;Amityville II: The Possession&quot; is essentially a prequel to &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; in that it tells why the home in the Long Island community was available for sale for that the Lutz family could move in and end up running fleeing for their lives.  This time it is the Montelli family that moves into the accursed house, which is not good because they are an unhappy family in the grand tradition of Tolstoy that is heading for trouble no matter where they live.  The main tension is between the father, Anthony (Burt Young), and his eldest song, Sonny (Jack Magner), and if it were not for the fact that anyone who saw the original movie knows what is going to happen at the end of this one, you might be wondering which one of these guys is going to lose it first.Surprisingly, this 1982 film goes through a lot of the same things as the original, which is not surprising for a sequel but more so because there was never a notion that every time somebody moves into this house rooms are covered with flies, blood comes out in strange places, and unseen presences are running around making people feel uneasy.  In another move that makes sense only in terms of the movies rather than the &quot;history&quot; of the house, the unseen beings start covering the walls of the children's bedroom with evil pictures and phrases.  At this point the film convinces you that there is something really evil in that house, and it would be Anthony Montelli.  Even when the local priest (James Olson) comes by to bless the house and sees Anthony going after his family, he walks away (which would seem to be good advice with regards to this film).On some levels this film is better than the original, but only in the sense that if there never had been an original this one might work better.  The flaw with the film version of &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; was that whereas the novel told a &quot;true&quot; story in a rather documentary style, which was abandoned for cheesy horror film effects.  The simple idea of possession that was implied to be the reason the son went off one night and killed his family is now adorned with a whole host of tacky &quot;Exorcist&quot; like ideas.  The irony, as I understand it, is that the killing of this family was the one bit of the hoax that really was true.  The names are changed because this film would have been the target for a lawsuit otherwise. If director Damiano Damiani had stuck to the true story and forgot about all this other nonsense he would have had a better film.  In fact, the only part of &quot;Amityville II: The Possession&quot; that really works is the night of the murders.",Amityville II: The Possession VHS

1584471,"A camera crew, with no benefits or life insurance, is on its way to film real evidence from a man (Frank Ashmore) who claims he has seen Bigfoot and has a BF body.

Darryl (Rich McDonald) is the cameraman who admires Robyn and Kevin is the nerdy sound man who ""smells."" He is also a Bigfoot believer.The characters and the dialouge I would rate as superior to most found footage films.

962228,"""The Squid and the Whale"" is a movie that shows us something we'd rather not see: The ugly side of divorce. I've always been fascinated with the way Hollywood portrays divorce. They never really portray it as something that is truly horrible, just as a ""touch luck/too bad"" thing that happens to many people. In other words, divorce is a part of human nature, and you might as well get used to it. Of course, people who have been effected by divorce will tell you otherwise. The fact that so many divorcees can watch Hollywood movies about divorce shows just how timid and kind Hollywood is to the subject.This is not one of those movies. This movie will not hold your hand and demand you not be scared by divorce. This movie does no less then get in your face and practicably beats you over the head with the horrible consequences of divorce. You may actually feel yourself worn out by the time the movie is finished. If you couldn't guess by now, the movie is about a married couple named Bernard and Joan, and their two kids Frank and Walt. Bernard and Joan have a rocky relationship. Bernard used to be a huge author, but now has trouble getting his books published. Joan used to have little interest in writing, but was inspired by her husband to try writing herself.Now the tables have turned some twenty years later, and now Joan is the successful writer and Bernard is the one with no career. They now fight all the time, with Bernard getting frustrated that he seems to be losing his power status with the family, and Joan feeling like her husband would rather have her on a leash. Soon the parents decide to divorce, to the surprise of no one (even to Frank and Walt). The kids aren't really surprised when their parents announce that they are splitting up, but they still can't really comprehend how things came to be this way. What's worse is that both kids have a parent he likes better, and the parents use this to their advantage.In what comes as the biggest blow to the audience, each of the grownup's start telling their kids stories about the other parents and giving that kid special privileges. Bernard tells Frank about affairs Joan has while they were married, and Joan lets Walt drink beer and read pornographic magazines. The bait serves it's purpose, and before you know it Frank and Walt have become pawns in their parents bickering match, and neither side will waver. A particularly heartbreaking scene comes in when Frank starts dating a girl. Both his parents have advice for him, but none of the advice he receives in on the same level, and Frank messes up with the girls because he can't decide which parent to listen to.Meanwhile, Walt picks up a couple of (truly disgusting) bad habits in order to get his parents attention, only to find out that his parents aren't really interested in solving the problem, but are rather more interested in seeing how they can put the blame for this behavior on one another. The squid and the whale is a metaphor, but what the metaphor is I won't tell you. As stated before, ""The Squid and the Whale"" is a tough movie. It takes a problem we are all too familiar with, and it presents it to us in away that many of us are unaware exists. The movie has some problems (the dad's affair with a student could have been handled better), but it is an excellent achievement in film.The movie has been playing in limited release, and it is definitely worth hunting down. It may be something you don't normally expect to see from your movies, but it does pay off quite well.",N/A
1404128,"All of the ""Final Destination"" movies pretty much blend into one big blob of killing beautiful young people in creative ways.  I would offer that FD 5 sticks to the same formula and does it well.  Twenty or so office workers are headed to an off-site retreat when they become stuck on a large bridge under repair.  Suddenly high winds cause a series of events (always fun to watch) that begin to destroy the bridge.Minutes earlier one of the young workers (Nicholas D'Agosto) has a vision of what will happen.  Like the previous movies, he's not sure what he's seeing but he knows that he must get others off the bus and the bridge.  Six or seven do (sorry I lost count) and manage to reach safety.  As in earlier episodes ""Death"" is not happy so begins to pick the survivors off one by one.  There really is no other plot.  There is some young romantic angst between Sam (D'Agosto) and his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell, ""Frozen"", & TV's ""The Walking Dead"") but it isn't important.  For those who like this franchise in general, you shouldn't be disappointed.Director Steven Quayle and his writing and visual effects team are highly creative in coming up with unusual ways to die.  FD 5 isn't really scary but there is no question tension is built as we try to guess things like when the gymnast is going to step on the metal screw on the balance beam.  I'm not sure when this series will end but the surprise at the end suggests this isn't the last of the films and not in the way you might think.The Blu ray transfer is crisp and clear in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The DTS HD Master Audio has plenty of action in all the speakers.  Snapping bridge cables will have you ducking.

1112953,"Just for kicks, THEY make noises in the night; they surround, they torment, they threaten, they hurt.  ""Them"" tells the apparently true story of a seemingly banal evil that terrorized locals in a rural area outside of Bucharest, Romania.  Rather than gore and exploitation, the filmmakers make inventive use of their camera and lighting and shadows and sound to create a serious atmosphere of dread.  It works, and gave me the same chills I had watchingThe Blair Witch Projectfor the first time: a sense of something ominous and intelligent and evil, that was somehow real and existed in the same plane as the documentary-style footage, that could be either human or something more.  Yes, I was definitely creeped out.I'd heard about this when it first played at festivals, and meant to see it ever since.  I like to keep up on foreign films, both arthouse and genre.  Still, I had the bad taste in my mouth after watching this one that comes when I see ""true crime"" specials about sadistic criminals on television.  Yes there is evil out there, and it is for the most part only a step away from ""normal.""  Still, in retrospect I wish I had the couple of hours I spent watching this back to spend on something that I could build on.  Or, rather, I wish I'd been able to walk away from this one with something valuable; not a ""moral"" since there's nothing more tedious than a film that tries to teach a lesson, but some new insight.  While the filmmakers tastefully avoid gratuitous violence or nudity, this is still not so far off from the nihilism of the so-called ""torture porn"" of films likeSawandHostel, which I've seen enough of (including those two) to decide it really is not my kind of thing.  Tied to that is that the main characters in the film are developed only slightly, not enough for me really to gain an appreciation of who they were or what their connection was.  Yes they could have been anyone, and that's part of the point, but they weren't just anyone and to watch a story like this with sufficient interest I have to know enough about the characters to care, and I didn't really get that in this case.  The female lead, Clementine, is a French teacher in Romania, frustrated by the rudeness of her pupils, and seemed much more active than her lover, Lucas.  When things start to happen he takes the lead, but only reluctantly, as if he knows that's what a man's supposed to do and does it.  The motives of ""them"" are meant to be inscrutable, and I understand that, but it leaves things pretty empty and hollow and unresolved.  That's not to discount the accomplishment of the filmmakers; they set out to tell a story that would scare the pants off of me and they came pretty close, and are obviously talented.  If you're in that kind of mood, and if you like this kind of thing, you're likely to appreciate ""Them.""  It's not for me.",N/A

They actually took the time (and the money) for full wrap-around arthroscopic hi-res 5:3:9 ratio.Second, the special features are choice.  As some of you may know, Michael Jackson actually tried out for the part that was eventually given to Samuel Jackson.  Well, as we all know, Samuel Jackson got the part - and the rest is history.  However, apparently MJ's performance was intense and his screen tests are available in the extra features of this Collector's Edition.Also a little known fact is that Jonathan Winters was to have a cameo in the film, but became ill during the shooting.  His scene and part were eventually cut from the film, but you can see this on the ""deleted scenes"" features.  Cool stuff!

Through the visions of three psychic ""precogs"" who can see homicides before they actually occur, members of the precrime unit (precops) can arrest people before they commit murder. Murder has literally become non-existent in DC.Chief of the Precrime unit John Anderton (Tom Cruise) believes in the system 100%.

However, credit must be given to the brilliant creativity and vision of director Steven Spielberg. I noticed definite influences from the late Stanley Kubrick here. This future world that Spielberg creates is extremely well thought out and detailed, some real brilliance here (I can't say too much). This is a typical role for Tom Cruise. Max von Sydow wonderfully plays Cruise's boss, Lamar Burgess, Director of Precrime. This is a fast-paced film, not just with action, but also with dialog, ideas and new concepts.

785081,"""Underworld"" is fun to watch, but it's really nothing more than an average sci-fi/action flick.  One thing is for sure, this movie is in no way a horror film.  Take any standard action yarn, replace the good guys with vampires and the bad guys with werewolves.  Next, throw in a twist that bonds one of the goodies and baddies together.  Finally, blend in a betrayal and a cover-up and you basically have the storyline.  There's nothing new here.The two supernatural enemies really don't even use their powers against each other that much.  The ""death dealer"" vampires have more guns than a cult in Waco.  They don't even get close to ripping open the necks of their enemies. The werewolves, for the most part, are happy reliving scenes from ""Fight Club"" in the city's subway tunnels.Don't think that this flick isn't enjoyable, though.  It is visually fun to watch and the action is pretty good.  I just wish that the vamps and wolves could have used their powers a little more than their guns.  The betrayal and cover-up mentioned earlier does actually make you pull for one side of the conflict a little more than the other, but in the end, you just want to see these folks beat the heck out of each other until someone yells, ""Uncle!""If you want real vampire or werewolf action, check out a movie like ""Interview With The Vampire""(better yet, read the book), or ""Silver Bullet""(again, the book is better).

1130048,"In HEADLESS HORSEMAN, director Anthony Ferrante takes considerable liberties with the classic short story by Washington Irving by cloaking it in a grabbag of Revolutionary War Gothicism mixed liberally with the Slasher Teen genre of countless Freddie and Jason retreads. Here, Ferrante places seven teens in a car.  These teens include the usual dopy kids, geeks, drama queens, and jock heads. En route to a party, they take a short cut and wind up in an out of the way secluded town called Wormwood, a title which bears no resemblance to the famous line from HAMLET. They learn that more than two centuries ago, a psycho killer liked to lop off the heads of his victims and he continued to do so until the towns people chopped his off in revenge.  But wait! Just as true evil never dies, the killer returned every seven years (minus his head) to seek new victims to decapitate.  He would ride a black horse and swing various lethal edged weapons to collect his heads.  By the time the teens learn all this they find out that their noggins are the true prize.HEADLLESS HORSEMAN manages to mix some pretty macabre humor with some gross out scenes of head slicing gore.  Richard Moll is the movie's only known actor as he plays a mean-spirited country bumpkin store owner who knows only too well what lies in store for the teens. One of the female leads plays a resident who surprisingly enough sympathizes with these stranded youngsters and spends most of the time walking around in a fetching short shorts and revealing blouse that make her seem like a reincarnated Elly May Clampett from the BEVERLY HILLBILLIES. The Horseman himself does far more than merely ride on his steed.  He is as equally at home on a motorcycle as he is on his feet.  He is, not unsurprisingly enough, immune to the many rifle bullets that come his way.  There is an unexpected poke at the stereotype of inbreeding in secluded mountain family groups. Richard Moll, in explaining that the current generation of genetically defective residents all of whom are the direct descendents of the Horseman, notes that he and his clan are merely engaged in ""repopulating the town.""  What emerges by the last reel of HEADLESS HORSEMAN is the unsettling notion that ancient evil and modern grim humor sometimes have to co-exist in a manner that does no favor for either victim or predator.",Headless Horseman
616554,"The interesting thing I noticed about the reviews for this movie is that every review literally has a completely different opinion of it, regardless of how they rated it. Basically, I liked the original American Pie, and I thought American Pie 2 was even better. THIS movie was okay, but I think only people that are really, REALLY into the first two movies can appreciate it.Jim has been dating Michelle for years, and he finally asks her for her hand in marriage, which she accepts. Eventually, Stifler decides to throw Jim a bachelor party, along with Jim's usual friends Kevin, Finch, and Oz -- wait, Oz isn't there. He wasn't even mentioned in the whole movie! What's up with that?I read somewhere that someone said this movie should have been called The Steve Stifler Show. I totally see where that reviewer is coming from (especially since Seann William Scott got higher billing than Alyson Hannigan). Yeah, Stifler WAS the funniest character in the first two movies, but in comparing those movies to THIS one, it seems like the antics and situations he was in have gone from funny and dumb to just dumb -- well, during the first half of the movie, anyway. And you have to admit that the scene in the gay bar wasn't 100% necessary.To me, the only character that was completely funny throughout the whole movie was Jim's dad (I have yet to see Eugene Levy on screen when he isn't extremely funny). The DVD extras weren't all that, either (but are they ever?) The ""Enter the Dominatrix"" thing was really kind of pointless, and  the ""Stifler Speak"" segment (starring...who else?) really makes you start to wonder just whose movie this is. All in all, though, while not a total waste of time, I'm glad I only rented this movie. But if you already own the other two movies, you might as well add this one to your collection.

So what is the problem? The coach has a son, Hugo (sound familiar?) that wants his dad to love him like a son. He does everything his father asks yet Odin was still the MVP. All he wants is a little appreciation. Too bad they didn't give it to him. So angry is Hugo that he unleashes the largest double-cross since Iago double-crossed Othello. It is too good to go on.

How long should we let people go before we ask is everything okay? See the film and you will understand.The acting from the young cast is solid and the film looks great. The all rap soundtrack was a little out of place, but it did serve well in some dramatic moments. The story is very solid, but don't forget, Shakepeare really wrote it. And on an additional note, anyone who is affraid this film is in Shakepearian English can relax, it's not.Problems aside, this film is worth a watch. I say read Othello first, but then it will give away the plot. Still the comparison is interesting and the filmmakers did a good job making it contemperary.",O
907489,"This has got be one of those movies that is so awful that there should be an Oscar category for it--but what, I'm not sure. The &#34;plot&#34; has something to do with people caught between Heaven and Hell, psychics, demons, the angel Gabriel, and Satan (who looks like Telly Savalas). All parties battle it out in pretty messy stile (lots of guts and green slime), and about all I could figure out is that Gabriel gets demoted to human status, Satan goes back to Hell, and Constantine is not able to stop his chain smoking. I think the people who created this thing had some high-tech film equipment, too much money, a fairly good special effects director; and must have been drinking heavily on the set, along with the writer.",Constantine
61836,"""Hindenburg"" is a pretty good film that unfortunately falls a bit flat. The concept, sets, effects, and the cast are all excellent, but there just seems to be some element missing.The cast is populated with famous faces from yesterday, a standard practice in all 70's disaster movies. Here we have the incomparable Gig Young, Burgess Meredith, Charles Durning, Richard A. Dysart, Robert Clary (late from ""Hogan's Heroes"" at this point), future Star Trek actor Rene Auberjonois, and Roy Thinnes. And of course, we have Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott. Scott and Thinnes really do their best, too (look at their confrontation scene when Thinnes' character mentions Scott's dead son!).Still, the cast just seems to be shuffling through this one, with little or no true tension generated, other than an emergency repair by some crewmen who must venture out onto the hull of the ship (an act that was accomplished, but never happened on Hindenburg's last trip).The end result is somewhat sparse, even strangely emotionless for the most part. Despite the overall blandness in tone, the film is compelling to watch anyway (thanks in large part to the cast and the effects).Knowing as we do what will eventually happen at Lakehurst, one cannot help but marvel at the ironic line the Hindenburg's Captain Proust utters several times throughout the course of film. In regards to the United States' bad luck with dirigibles he remarks, ""It's no wonder they lose all their airships.""The ending of the film seems to mystify some viewers today, but it is, in reality, an incredibly artistic, stylish (and daring), choice on the part of director Robert Wise and the producers. Capturing the action in black and white, with actual newsreel footage of the disaster added, and freezing images in place, Wise makes a stunning montage of the disaster and of the cast members as they flee the impending peril. Even though the end result is only partially effective, the montage makes an artistic statement nevertheless, the kind that Hollywood avoids today. With noisy garbage like ""XXX"" and ""Ace Ventura"" littering our cineplexes, it's nice to know that at one time in the recent past, there was room in Hollywood for some creative and bold artistry in films! Would that it could become fashionable again!An interesting side note here is the night time launch of the Hindenburg. The ship is lit with searchlights that create odd, circular patches of light on the airship's hull. Five years later, Wise directed the critically panned ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". In that film, the Starship Enterprise is lit in a similar fashion, with spotlights on the ship's various insignia that create pools of light from odd angles.",N/A

329530,"This is one of Von Trier's most unseen films.  It was initially released as Zentropa (the name of Lars's production company) to avoid confusion with Europa, Europa.  When it was released on home video initially, it was a pan and scan print that did no justice to the film.  Now, Criterion has put it out in a stunning, 2.35:1 DVD, so is it a good film?There is much to like in Europa.  The cinematography and the mise-en-scene is beautiful.  Von Trier's early work (this film and The Element of Crime, his debut) show a great eye for composition and framing that was abandoned in his later work for a hand held, jump cut style.  He also uses long takes in this film quite well, and the film has one of the more unique looks in his filmography.  It is mostly shot in black and white with splashes of color.  There are a lot of back screen projections that give the film a real sense of nightmare, and it works quite well.There are some very funny moments, especially with Ernst-Hugo J&auml;regrd as the uncle who gets his American nephew, Jean-Marc Barr, a job working in Germany after WWII.  He gives the best performance in the film.  Jean-Marc Barr's performance is good, but his character is rather one note.  Barr's character is so simplistically written he might as well have had ""idealist"" tattooed to his forehead.  In fact, the script of Europa is the weakest thing about the film.  You can marvel at the look of the film (and it does look fantastic), but ultimately, it's not an insightful look at post-war Germany.  Most of the dialogue is expository, and most of the characters feel like caricatures, not real people.  In fact, aside from Ernst-Hugo J&auml;regrd's character (which is very funny), the whole cast (with former Fassbinder regulars Barbara Sukowa & Udo Kier, and Godard and Fassbinder regular Eddie Constantine) slog their way through their one note characterisations.  They're such good actors that they're worth watching, but I wish they had more to do.While they are some amazing shots in this film, it's a rather hollow film.  Still, I did like it, even though I felt it could have been much more profound.",Zentropa VHS

1598917,"HOOK, LINE & SINKER has a terrible reputation.  Some critics such as Leonard Maltin in his MOVIE GUIDE call the film a bomb.  I don't agree.  While it's not prime Jerry it's certainly better, imo, than some of his other late 60's titles such as WAY WAY OUT! & DON'T RAISE THE BRIDGE, LOWER THE RIVER.  Like those other Lewis films this is not a film directed by Lewis himself, but rather by old Hollywood hand George Marshall, whose career went back to the silent days, and whose final feature film this would be.There is a good plot in this film.  Lewis' doctor (Peter Lawford) tells Jerry that he has a heart condition and limited time left, his wife (the beautiful Anne Francis) tells him he should make the most of the time that is left and enjoy his final days doing what he loves--fishing--in exotic locales using only the best equipment on chartered boats, etc.  It will cost a fortune--of course Lewis doesn't have that kind of money, but his wife tells him to put it all on credit cards and not worry about the bills--his insurance will pay for it when he croaks.  The trouble is that it's all a set-up and Lewis is not dying and the doctor and wife are in cahoots.There are some good sight gags in the film--a wild dance by a drunken Jerry and an amusing scene where he breaks into a morgue by coming thru a window and attempting to light a candle.  That is all vintage stuff, but for a lot of the picture it's a  black comedy which Lewis plays fairly straight and allows others to shine--such as the always terrific Kathleen Freeman playing baby sitter to Lewis and Francis's children.This film (released by Columbia) was released 20 years after the first Jerry Lewis film, MY FRIEND IRMA.  For 15 of those 20 years, Lewis was a top box office star both with his partner Dean Martin and individually from 1957-1964 in a string of classic comedies most directed by Lewis and his mentor, Frank Tashlin.  After 1964, the quality of Lewis's films fell off and slowly so did his box office potency.  After HOOK LINE & SINKER, Lewis would complete only two more films--before taking a long sabbatical from pictures. Part of the falling off of his popularity is that after 1964, as Lewis was close to turning 40, he decided he was too old to play 'The Kid' and made an attempt to mature his screen image.  Sometimes it worked (I love BOEING BOEING) and sometimes it fell flat.  HOOK LINE & SINKER, I think, falls somewhere in the middle.",N/A

405097,"The title itself of the Wayans Brother's 1996 parody, Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, comically implies to several different films concerning African-American males coming of age in socially troubling environments.  Some of the titles that come to mind are Boyz n the Hood (1991), Juice (1992), and Menace II Society (1993) among many others.  Even though many of these films possess a high cinematic value, the Wayans recognize an excess of these types of films, as they provide a parody portrayal of the difficulties young African-American males face while growing up in rough neighborhoods throughout the United States.  Guiltlessly the Wayans approach this theme with ruthless abandon while applying their traditional spoofing spin on it, which unquestionably will cause both irritation and amusement.The story follows a similar path of Boyz n the Hood from which the audience will recognize the name Tr&eacute;.  Here the name has mutated into Ashtray, and is performed by Shawn Wayans.  The film opens with a picturesque aerial shot of the neighborhood where a stop sign is one of the first things that attracts the audience's attention, which states, ""I wouldn't stop if I was you.""  It is a brief display of impending parody and the comic tone that will heavily play with stereotypes and prejudices, but it also hints of the merciless assault of satire that the Wayans will deliver in this film.Ashtray's mother drops him off at his father's place while she states, ""You know there ain't no positive black females in these movies.""  Ashtray is supposed to learn how to become a man from his father.  Hilariously the audience will discover that Ashtray's father is younger than him, and this immature character could not possibly teach Ashtray any character qualities such as responsibility and loyalty.  Instead, the father informs him not to smoke or drink his stuff while also letting him spend bedtime with the women he brings home.  Despite the crazy humor, the Wayans produce serious undercurrents that deal with racial issues, stereotypes across ethnic groups, and gender issues.The social importance of friendships is seen through Ashtray's cousin Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) whose identity is more or less ripped off from O-Dog in Menace II Society.  The parody does not take any hostages in this film, as it fools around with the idea of being in bad company.  Together Loc Dog and Ashtray continue to display the daily struggles of living in the `hood.  There are moments when the film presents high quality parody to scenes where the comedy sinks to the level of a third grader's poop humor.  Nevertheless, Don't Be a Menace touches a part of the American tapestry with brutal honesty, as this spoof could also serve as a social criticism.  The scene where they play Po'Nopoly, a Monopoly spoof, highlights some of the dismal situations where society limits the African-Americans.Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood might suggest to some that there have been too many films about struggling young African-American males.  Maybe the parody is on society, as several films have to be made, yet no significant changes have been made to help promote a better situation for African-Americans.  The Wayans recognize the problem and through this parody deliver a message that something has to be done so people do not need to say, ""Man, I need to get out of this place.""",Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood VHS

1221252,"""Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon"" is pretty much a standard SyFy channel offering, with the exception that it's set in the early 1900's. This was definitely not the best movie I've ever seen, but I can't say it was the very worst I've ever seen, either. Mildy entertaining, but at times I found my mind wandering. I give it 2.5 stars, so I rounded up to 3.Fans of Stargate SG-1 will appreciate seeing Michael Shanks (SG-1's Daniel) and J.R. Bourne (SG-1's Martouf). Oddly enough Michael Shanks is an archeologist here, too. I won't detail the storyline as others have already done so.I realize this is from SyFy, and that life isn't all roses, but I was kind of surprised at the amount of gore, some of it was quite gross. I haven't seen it quite this bad with SyFy's other movies. Since this is a TV movie and it's ""not rated"", I wanted to point this out. (I would rate it at least pg-13 due to the gore.)A few examples: a man gets shot in the forehead with an arrow, someone commits suicide and chunky-looking blood is shown hitting the wall, a couple of people are cut open on an alter (while conscious) and their hearts are taken out while blood runs down their sides, and the worst was when a man had half his head cut off at a steep angle in a booby-trap. While we're talking about content, there are no bedroom scenes, however a man makes an inappropriate comment when he finds a woman looking for something in his tent. Hopefully this partial content review will help someone make a more informed decision! :)I really can't see watching this more than once...while I did watch the whole thing, I have no desire to ever see it again. At times it wasn't too bad, but other (most) times I was anxious for it to be over. If you're curious, rent it or try to catch it on Syfy, but I wouldn't recommend making a decision to buy it until after you've seen it.",Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon
786516,"Probably the most hyped backwoods horror flick of 2003, Cabin Fever received early marks from many critics as a great return to 80's style horror. Lion's Gate Films was the lucky studio that got its hands on the picture for distribution, but upon wide release, seemingly most horror fans who saw it proclaimed it one of the worst films of the year. Kinda makes you question if pre-release hype is the slightest bit reliable (I remember people talking about how terrible the script for the Dawn of the Dead remake was, but it turned out to be the best horror film since The Ring).Sporting an opening not too dissimilar from The Evil Dead, Cabin Fever begins with five teens going on a trip to the woods for a weekend of fun and relaxation. Among the teens are nice guy Paul (Rider Strong), who's desperate to sleep with his best friend Karen (Jordan Ladd), horny couple Jeff and Marcy (Joey Kern and Cerina Vincent), and goofball Bert (James DeBello), who gets on everyone else's nerves on so many occasions, I wondered why the others bothered to bring him along.They reach their cabin with little problem and everything goes well at first; Jeff and Marcy fornicate without abandon, Karen kisses Paul for the first time, and Bert is having fun shooting at the small local wildlife. But the arrival of a sick man infected with a skin-eating disease at their door one night leads to total disaster, he vomits blood all over their car, which gets trashed, and runs off burning when Paul jabs him with a ""torch."" Thinking their immediate problems are over, the teens just want to get a mechanic to fix their car, but an even worse problem arises, the flesh-eating bacteria has somehow passed on to one of them, resulting in paranoia and disease that will lead to a literal bloodbath.Cabin Fever is a film where one gets the distinct impression that the writer/director is truly an enthusiastic horror fan that wants to pay homage to as many genre classics as possible, while also carving this film its own niche as a scary, funny gorefest. And certainly, director Eli Roth gets much of the film right and has a strong handle when it comes to pacing and dreadful anticipation.CF is already effective merely because of its premise; the fear of hideous bodily horror is something that probably spooks most of us, I know it has that effect on me. For the most part, Roth plays this for all its worth, we get numerous scenes of the teens trying to avoid touching others who are infected, and lots of scenes of victims vomiting blood and peeling flesh. Disgusting, but undeniably eye-catching and hard to turn away from.Roth also smartly develops the characters first, which has been a surprisingly growing trend recently (Wrong Turn and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake also attempted to flesh out their characters first). This is not to say we've got full-on, three-dimensional characterizations at work here, but the protagonists are generally likeable, particularly Rider Strong and Jordan Ladd. Hottie Cerina Vincent has the unenviable task of playing the [promiscuous woman], but the role is played with more intelligece than usual, and it's great to see nudity in a time when most slashers shy away from bare flesh (it's too bad one of Cerina's nude scenes is during a particularly uncomfortable moment).But Cabin Fever is marred with astoundingly idiotic scenes and plot twists and turns. The initial set-up, that of the teens having to deal with the disease, is a great one. But throwing in gun-toting rednecks and a weird kid obsessed with biting people was a bad move. The only logical reason I figure Roth included the backwoods folks was to give the movie a higher bodycount and throw in more opportunities for gruesome mayhem. Sure, the violence is pretty hypnotic in a ""wow, I can't believe I just saw that"" way that most mainstream big-studio films try to stray away from, but it comes at too much of a cost to the film's initially solid premise.The whole mess in the film occurs because the sick hermit went to the teens for help. Then we later find out he's actually the cousin of a nearby meat factory worker. Why didn't he just go to her for help instead, especially considering she's already aware of a disease being passed around to the wildlife and is likely familiar with the whereabouts of the local hospital. There are also questions involving who got infected when, but there's enough context clues that it's not particularly bothersome that we don't see the exact moment of infection. We just never find out where the disease originated from, not that it really matters.Roth's attempts at morbid laughs range from rock solid (the bowling story) to just eye-rollingly ridiculous (Paul's constant mishaps, whether it's a ladder that breaks, murderous rednecks, a dangerous dog, a deer conveniently in the middle of the road, and the local police force). In fact, I'm not even sure if Roth meant for the latter half of the film to even be taken seriously. When you've got a kid with a mullet yelling ""pancakes!"" and performing half-assed martial arts moves in slow motion, you know something has seriously gone wrong.Even that doesn't compare to the terrible final scenes, which actually features creepy music accompanying a scene that I think Roth wanted for us to expect another bloody surprise, then suddenly segues into rap music that then abruptly switches to banjo music. I can only say, what the hell? The constant switch of music is bad enough, the scene it goes with is actually even worse.But for all the mistakes the second half makes, I still had a pretty good time. Cabin Fever is never boring, a rarity in horror these days, and it avoids some cliches that I would have expected in a bigger budget slasher (though given the direction this film takes, I might actually have preferred some of those cliches). Great score by Angelo Badalamenti, too, no surprise there.",Cabin Fever

1469259,"I really enjoyed this lighthearted action movie.It's a fanciful contemporary spin on the myth of how the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, long after having dethroned and permanently immobilized their titanic father Cronos, have become less powerful due to the declining devotions of the people. ""Not without reason"" says Perseus sarcastically when he's visited by Zeus with this complaint.  Now here you have the first departure from the Tradition: per Hesiod, the declining sacred religious devotions of people signalled the fall of the golden age into silver, then bronze and iron.  IE, devolutionary descent into skepticism and religious non-observance harms the people rather than the gods.  But of course we live in the modern secular ""kali yuga"" ourselves and so the common inverse of the Tradition principle is the pretext instead.  Well that's enough semiotic interpretation there.  Back to the story.  So anyhow Old Cronos is about to bust loose, and hence the need for Zeus to enlist demigod assistance to whup the titans up oncet 'gin.I wasn't overmuch bothered by this modern heresy against the ancient polytheistic Tradition, since the movie immediately presents not as grand tragedy, but as  fun and humorous.  Rather than the pretentious desacralized ""Troy"" of diretor Wolfgang Peterson, which plods unhappily along without the gods, as a kind of secular revisionist unsuccessful stab at improving the Illiad.The all star cast was not wasted on this film.  Liam Neeson makes a fine Jove, a wee bit humbler than one imagines Zeus Olympias, but it works in the story.  Ralph Fiennes really steals the show as a conflicted Hades who goes the wrong way due to his ressentiment of his brothers, then turns back to the right path in time to save the day.  Unexpectedly, Vulcan has a big role in this film, which I found very imaginative, depicting him as a kind of skinny elder tinkering sage more so than the jealous cripple often conjured by the Hellenic myths.Sam Worthington perplexes as Perseus a bit, overplaying the reluctant hero theme a bit.  I realize he was probably trying to bring value to a simple action role but hey Sam, thats all it really was. The demigod aspect of the character was just backstory.Rosamund Pike plays an Amazonian Andromeda, all dressed up in a tunica intima and bronze greaves etc, leading the phalanx and so forth.  An even odder twist, but one sense that Hollywood now demands a female presence to fetch in more ticket sales.  She played it well even if it was obligatory and she's easy on the eyes for sure.The special effects to me here were totally satisfactory and can't really help being besides the point with this series since the original ""wrath of the titans"" evoked by the title-- the one with Laurence Olivier and Harry Hamlin-- was unforgettable for how cheesy the stop-motion effects seem today.All in all a good rental for watching with one's teenage kids.  I totally recommend it served up with pizza and beer.",N/A

379881,"""Re-Animator"" is directed by Stuart Gordon. This sci-fi comedy horror film is based on the H.P. Lovecraft story ""Herbert West-Reanimator"". H.P. Lovecraft was guided by the philosophical principle that life was incomprehensible to human minds, and that the universe was inimical to the interests of humankind. In ""Re-Animator"" this notion is explored as experiments in bringing animals and people back from the dead sets in motion an uncontrollable orgy of madness. Herbert West's experiments are transgressions of societal morality that open the doors of madness upon the medical staff at the Miskatonic University in New England. This film is more comedy than horror with its almost giddy exuberance and over the top handling of grisly reanimations of humans and their body parts. The horror is transcended by this hysterical mania of people creating and then trying to escape from the ever growing chaos of gruesome creations. The obsessions of West, and his nemesis Dr. Carl Hill, to explore the boundaries of the known and transgress moral limits leads to terrible consequences for all, though right to the end of the story the desire by the living to bring back those who have died is represented as the greater need than the incurring folly of the inevitably horrible consequences for the reanimated ones. The world depicted by Stuart Gordon is of an absurd universe where people who are unbounded by moral conscience create chaos for those around them. If you like your horror over the top then this film may be for you.For those that enjoy this film one may want to also check out ""Evil Dead II"", and ""Dead Alive"".",N/A
571748,"The first time I saw this movie (can't believe it was over six years ago), I wrote that Nurse Betty was delightful -- not the movie, but the character.  It's too bad Renee changed too much since her naivete in this silly film within a film.  Lots of things have changed in six or seven years -- I know I have, that's for sure.  When I found this tape, I was shocked, thinking either I have changed or watching it in a theater added a bit of magic lacking on the tape.  Nobody is that un-sophisticated.  Perhaps her ""unknowing"" character was the story (may be every girl's fantasy) takes her on a journey into the world of soap operas.  She was too sweet to be true.  We don't all get what we wish for; this is a modern fairytale like 'Born Yesterday.'Here, now, is Wink's ""A Reason to Love.""  He must have found this same tape in April out there when he accused another Betty of creating a soap opera.  Chuck is no Greg Kinnear.  All Bettys are not so dumb as to travel to California while in a dream state caused by Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  She becomes the character and fascinates Dr. David as she dresses like a nurse and successfully lands a job in a real hospital.Betty was damaged emotionally by the sight of her real-life, abusive husband after he was savagely murdered.  Suddenly, she's free to be herself and spend some time in fairy land out in Los Angeles.  They found her charming and relentless, but she is not a Southerner.  After a foray into a world she does not understand, she lost her spontenanity and is devastated when her idol proves to be less than a god -- when he calls her crazy or deranged.  Later, he changes his mind.  Greg Kinnear is as handsome in this role as our George Clooney, only better.  She had told him ""If you were any handsomer, it'd be a crime; it's too bad you're such an -------.""He inadvertendly sends Del's killers to her before she can safely get away in the car which has their drugs in the trunk.  The publicity of the ordeal at which both father and son murderers died gained her dream come true.  She and David were together for sixty-three episodes.

1378795,"I enjoyed this miniseries on Blu-Ray, but I found myself getting more and more annoyed by the editing.  At every commercial break, instead of nicely tapering off the music and sound effects way ahead of time and dissolving the audio with a clean cut for the video so that it feels seamless, they just suddenly duck the music at the last second and do a fast fade past black, often returning to completely different music.As somebody who used to do a lot of TV production work, I found it very jarring, particularly during the third part, where you'd be smack in the middle of an intense action sequence, and then bam, suddenly the entire feel of the program shifts without warning.  That makes it glaringly obvious where every commercial break fell.Contrast this, for example, with Stargate SG-1, where they designed it for continuous viewing, and unless you just know how to spot the act breaks, it feels like a short film.  That's the way TV editing should be done.  Besides, there's no guarantee that a rebroadcast will put the breaks in the same places anyway, which is why a well-edited TV show should *always* be seamless when viewed without commercials even if you don't plan to make it available on DVD.  You can always put in the fades after the fact, but you can't easily take them out if they're poorly burned into the master.This miniseries makes me wonder if any of the editors actually sat down and watched each part from beginning to end before the program aired.  It just feels sloppy.  Somebody should really go back and at least put in some J-cuts or something.",Fallen
1276961,"I didn't expect much going in to see this remake of a 1974 film and I left the theater feeling pretty much how I felt before I bought my ticket. A story which was quite unique 35 years ago is no longer anything special and the performances were all over the map. Denzel Washington gained 40 or so pounds for the part and was quite believable playing this low key character, but John Travolta played this villain like the wild one in Face Off. It worked in that other film, because just about every scene was so over the top, but everything here is based in reality so it came across as almost cartoonish at times. Don't get me wrong, he seemed to be having a great time playing the character and he did have a few good lines, but we have already seen this character done better in that John Woo movie back in 1997. John Turturro and James Gandolfini both did well with much smaller roles.The ending also missed the mark. In fact, the last 30 minutes or so brought the film down from it's flawed, yet entertaining level. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 screams DVD rental and nothing more. This is a ride you can catch later at a much cheaper fare.2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",N/A
644037,"Stick It is one of those sports films that you come away from seeing feeling that it was better than you thought it would be but could have been so much better.Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a wild child. She was once a gymnast who showed great promise before unexpectedly walked away from the sport. After some troubles at home she is sent to the Vickerman Gymnastics Academy run by the surly Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges). It is here that she must once again prove herself and find a new start.This is not Oscar material but it is a good way to spend a few hours in a darkened theatre. The acting is spotty but acceptable. Peregrym shines as Haley but she comes across as a little to cute to be the punky troublemaker that she is made out to be. Bridges is his usual self and his acting is good but this does not appear to be one of his more challenging roles. There is good support from the actual gymnasts who filled in as doubles for the main characters. The secondary characters are somewhat less well developed but are played decently by Vanessa Lengies (Joanne Charis), Nikki SooHoo (Wei Wei Yong) and Maddy Curley (Mina Hoyt).The film has an MTV feel with lots of cuts and booming soundtrack. It's target audience tween and teenage girls and it will be quite effective with this age group. It even teaches a lesson in that things can be changed by working together to make a difference. First time director Jessica Bendinger has done a fine job with her debut film.The true highlight of this disc resides in its bonus features. The film has two comentaries: one by Bendinger and her primary actresses Lengies and Peregrym, the second by Bendinger and DP, Daryn Okada and editor, Troy Takaki. Also featured are 8 deleted scenes with multiple commentaries, a intoductory featurette of the actual gymnasts who acted as stunt doubles, slowed down uneven bar routines (also with optional comentary); routines performed by the elite gymnasts( with commentary) and two music videos.As mentioned this is not a bad film to see with your family and is definately worth a rental.",N/A

964517,"PARADISE NOW(2005)A Moslim film about two Palestinian homicide bombers who run into some difficulties while attempting to infiltrate Israel so as to murder as many Jews as possible when they detonate.A surprisingly reasonably good film that has an almost Hitchcockian feel in its handling of the basic suspense plot. The acting and direction are expert. The film is an interesting presentation of Palestinian culture for those curious. The film is not at all successful in explaining and indeed does not even address the Moslem obsession with death.It is generally anti-Jewish though since it IS from the Palestinian viewpoint that is not necessarily bad form. The film comes dangerously close to being pro-terrorist but pulls back at the last moment. The only fumbles are 1) All the Palestinian whining about being oppressed and living in hell is defeated by the simple fact that the West Bank does not look all that different from parts of Queens or Brooklyn and the residents are shown being able to rent or purchase snuff videos for their home entertainment so what is the big problem?? B) The film keeps insisting that the Homicide bombers are only targeting Israeli soldiers when obviously the reality--aka civilians, women and children--puts the lie to that. And one was amused to see one of the terrorists(who is portrayed as being a nice terrorist who would never blow up children) somehow managing to get on a public bus occupied mostly by soldiers. Uh.Uh. And finally C) the film cheats by ending at the point of detonation and not showing the results of this barbaric war crime.An Israeli film dramatizing the other side needs to be made.

The orchestra is Concentus Musicus (Harnoncourt's famous band); they play very well. Sound quality is about what you'd expect from 1960s.

Now you are looking at the 1997 made-for-TV version which I find fairly entertaining even though you can hardly call it a faithful adaptation. But anyway, I didn't like the original story's ending very much.Mandy Patinkin is Quasimodo with special make-up. Salma Hayek is Esmeralda (with several dancing scenes that are downplayed for TV) while Richard Harris is Frollo, archdeacon obsessed with his love, or lust, for Esmeralda. Three major actors are all very good, especially late Richard Harris showing a completely different turn from that of benign Professor Dumbledore, but you may regret the lack of character development in them.Some characters of the book are missing to make room for the story of the major ones and some incidents are drastically changed. A murder is committed, but in an entirely differently way, making the murderer's motive much less convincing. But they managed to put in a goat.The Emmy-nominated production designs are decent, but the streets of Paris sometimes look more like some village in Eastern Europe (where it was actually shot).

I much prefer no circus, leaving El Gallo's persona to the imagination, rather than having him be some literal creature of human form.  I see him as nature overlooking the callow, helping to mature natural naivete.  And who on earth cast the actor in the role of El Gallo?  He is weak vocally and not nearly handsome enough to attract Luisa.  He might just as well have been Matt as El Gallo.  Joel Grey, who is given top billing, likely because of the fame he garnered after his brilliant portrayal of the MC in &#34;Cabaret,&#34; provides a lackluster, very disappointing portrayal of the girl's father.

1443759,"There have been some number of ""issue"" movies over the years. This is better than average, but just a bit.Here's the scoop. Gavin (Charlie Hunnam) is a likable, easy going hotel manager. He gets new neighbors in his building, Shana and Joe Harris (Liv Tyler and Patrick Wilson). It's realized right off the bat that Gavin and Joe are on opposite sides of the ""God"" issue, and as Gavin finds himself uncontrollably drawn to Shana the issue is brought to its extreme with Gavin finding himself on a tall ledge poised to jump.I like this kind of movie because I'm drawn to these kinds of arguments. Writer/Director Matthew Chapman is clearly siding with Gavin, but shows good reason why Joe and Shana are so strongly religious. The four principal characters, Gavin, Joe, Shana and detective Hollis Lucetti (Terrence Howard) who is trying to talk Gavin off the ledge, all have or had life altering problems in their lives. They merely chose different ways to re-emerge into the world. So the viewer does not want to slot them as me good you bad black and white. But finally how far will you go to defend your belief? Where is the line that you will not cross?This is a good watch. Hunnam has a certain presence in front of the camera but he's got a rather narrow range as an actor. His role needed someone with much more gravity. I liked Wilson and Tyler a lot. I thought they handled their roles well. I find Howard not much better than Hunnam. I'm glad they switched him out for Don Cheadle in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But this all moves at a steady pace and you really want to know how Gavin will handle his deadline. I found the progression from the opening scene, where Gavin climbs out on the ledge, to the backtracking of how he came to be there, very satisfying.

Now that the new version is releasing in April, I thought `sure why not?' and decided to rent this movie.The story is about the Lutz family, consisting of George (the dad, played by James Brolin), Kathy (the wife, played by Margot Kidder), and their kids, Amy, Greg and Matt. They move into a new house on Amityville, Long Island, which is huge, for a really cheap price, because of the history of the house. Before they moved in, a man who lived there shot he wife and four kids in the house while they were sleeping and then shot himself; the reason unknown. Once the Lutz family moves in, each of them start experiencing strange things. The priest who comes in the house sees flies and becomes ill. George starts acting different and begins to feel cold all the time. Amy makes friends with `Jody', a person nobody else can see. A windowsill pushes down on Greg's hand and gets stuck there, making him bleed. Kathy starts suspecting that there is something really wrong with the house. Her Aunt, a nun, too falls ill upon entering the house. Kathy's brother finds his money disappeared before the wedding. Can Kathy prevent the house from taking over her family before it's too late?I wouldn't call this movie really scary. There were some really eerie moments like the flies, and the rocking chair in Amy's room, but apart from that, it very pretty much bland. While the background music really gives a creepy feeling during the scenes, the special effects just ruin it. I know this movie was taken in 1979, but so were the Star Trek series and I felt that they could have made the ghost look more horrifying. The actors, however, did a wonderful job in the movie. James Brolin and Margot Kidder acted splendidly as did Rod Steiger as Father Delaney. Stuart Rosenberg, did a good job with the direction.I wouldn't really call it spooky, since I felt that the `Poltergeist' was made much better than this, since it's in the same genre. I can understand why it would have been famous in the 70s but when you watch it now, it just doesn't hold that effect on you. Nevertheless, it is entertaining to watch, and if you are a horror movie fan, you will definitely enjoy this.",N/A
1646466,"This was more violent than I expected. Had it not been animated, I think it would have merited an R rating. Pretty dark, and I'm still not sure exactly why.Flash is a fun character, and I'm glad they finally told a story about him. Of course, the Flash they focused on was Barry Allen, and the show seemed to assume that viewers know a lot about him when I knew next to nothing. (The Flash I was familiar with is Wally.) Barry seemed...I don't know. Maybe too much like the others? I knew how Wally worked within the Justice League, but we hardly see anything of Barry and his world before we're launched into a dystopian alternate universe. Watching him in action was cool, but I didn't feel like I got much of a sense of him as a person.But the bigger problem was the larger story. I don't know whether I want to watch it again simply because I watch to be entertained and enjoy myself, not to make myself sick watching people kill or torture each other or being depressed with messages about how awful people are or life is. (I'm exaggerating a little, but not as much as I wish I was.) The story never answered critical questions. For example...SPOILERSFlash's attempt to use time travel through the Speed Force to prevent the murder of his mother is somehow responsible for all of the problems that have come about in this alternate universe. But I thought what caused the problems wasn't saving his mother in itself, but the act of breaking the chronal barrier? If so, catching up to his younger self and stopping him wouldn't have prevented any of this because his younger self had already broken that barrier. And it doesn't explain how Flash's actions could change so many things that happened at different times. (Ex: Superman's arrival as a baby, the shooting of Bruce's parents, the arrival of Abin Sur and Hal taking on the mantle of the Green Lantern. Nit pick, but why would the ring not have found Hal even if the timing had changed a little and he wasn't right there?)Then too, the story never explains critical changes in characters, specifically Wonder Woman and Aquaman. Those who developed this plot clearly don't take them seriously as heroic characters, because they have these guys go to the dark side and way above and beyond in destroying the world and others based on a tragic but isolated incident, a personal feud. The plot relies on neither of them having any sense of proportion or any concern for the impact of their conflict on the earth and on their peoples, when that is about as uncharacteristic for both of them as it gets. None of that made any sense. Heroism may be developed and fostered by associating with high-caliber people, but it comes from what's already there in people. Yet this story never explains why these characters are suddenly and somehow without any sense of morality.In any case, well-done in a lot of ways, but disturbing and with some serious plot holes so far as I'm concerned.",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox

602402,"This miniseries comes from back in the days before all you had to do to call a movie a ""miniseries"" was to make it big enough that it had to run on two or more nights. It's the same logic as using the term ""box set"" for any audio CD that requires two discs. Okay--end of rant.Failing farmer Will Henry Lee (Wayne Rogers) decides to accept the job of Delano's first chief of police rather than dig himself further into debt with credit extensions banker Hugh Holmes (Charlton Heston) still would have approved. But Holmes in his other role of the town's most prominent citizen agrees with Will Henry on his career change--he's the one who suggests the new job to him to begin with and supports his candidacy. Holmes also serves as voice-over narrator at intervals during the film. One person who does not agree is Sheriff Skeeter Willis (Paul Sorvino), who feels that Will Henry is not tough enough to be a cop. One other citizen who shares that view is reclusive landowner Foxy Funderburke (Keith Carradine), who was the other candidate for the job and didn't get chosen. Funderburke serves as the clich&eacute; ""mad hermit"" of the story. The story runs through an epic five decades, with other stars such as Billy Dee Williams as the first black chief much later in the film, plus Victoria Tennant (who we know from her co-starring role in ""Winds Of War/ War and Remembrance"") as the beautiful and gutsy English ""war bride"" of Will Henry's son Billy.Now as for the lousy sound. According to a disclaimer slide at the beginning of this DVD version, the original film suffered a lot of damage to the soundtrack while in storage, so it can't be helped. I believe I still have VHS tapes of this miniseries I grabbed off the air which sound better. But we'll have to wait for whatever tech improvements clean that up if there is a later version of this. It really is only that bad at first and I got used to it within a few minutes. At least you don't get synch problems between the audio and the picture.",N/A

85146,"I really must admit that I'm torn over what I think of this film.  Having missed it in theaters, I managed to catch it a couple of weeks ago at my neighbors' house.  Honestly, other than knowing it had won the Best Picture Oscar, I really didn't have a clue what the movie was about before watching it, other than having something to do with a drug deal gone wrong.  The story grabs the viewer right from the beginning, and slowly you start to piece together what is going on.  I like it when directors allow me to use my brain to figure things out, instead of just spoon feeding me the plot.  As the film progressed, I became more and more involved with the characters and the story.  When we took a popcorn break, we discussed how much we were enjoying the movie, and how surprised we all were that it was this good.  The cinematography is really something to see in this film.  It's not Lawrence of Arabia good, but it is quality work.  The acting is solid from the leads to the supporting cast.  Tommy Lee Jones never disappoints, and Javier Bardem, whom I had never seen before, gives a truly chilling performance.  Bardem's acting prowess was such that I have begun to search out his previous films.  So with all this praise, why do I not give this movie a perfect score???  THAT is my quandary.  While 98% of the movie blew me away, it's the ending.....or lack of one, that leaves me a little disappointed.  Just when things seemed to be headed for a rewarding climax, it ends.  This left me with MANY unanswered questions.  But as time has passed I have asked myself it that was the intention of the creators of the film, because even though we were all not happy with the ending, we have discussed what we thought happened since our viewing.  If I could give it 3.5 stars I would.  It is a great piece of film, but it was just personally disappointing to me because of the ending.  If you don't mind getting lead to the edge of a precipice and being left there to hang, then you will LOVE this movie.",N/A
1138562,"Much of the negative criticism leveled at Roland Emmerich's ""10,000 BC"" is valid.  The film is derivative of other (better) films including ""The Searchers"", ""King Kong"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" and dozens more; it's chock full of anachronisms and dubious history; and the story is at times unbearably cheesy, especially when the screenplay cheats the audience by using mysticism and magic to achieve contrived emotional effects (this is particularly true of the story's hokey happy ending).And yet, despite these flaws, the film is not without its charms.  For those viewers able to suspend logic and focus simply on its visual qualities, ""10,000 BC"" offers up some splendid special effects, gorgeous art direction and set decorations, and best of all, exquisite cinematography by Ueli Steiger that truly stimulates the imagination.  I experienced the film on Blu-ray disc screened on a 60 inch 1080i monitor, and was so impressed by the lavishness of the production that I frequently forgot and forgave the vagaries of the screenplay.  This is a movie that is perfect for those nights when you want to disengage your mind, relax with a bowl of popcorn, and simply pass two hours enjoying an inconsequential spectacle that requires a minimum amount of concentration.  If you can appreciate it for what it is, and not be disappointed by what it isn't, you may very well get a kick out of ""10,000 BC"".","10,000 B.C."
1071858,"Act of Violence (1948):Act of Violence is a film that tries to be more than what it can deliver. It tries to be a significant film, as Hollywood defines ""significant,"" of weakness and obsession, with a bit of irony and, of course, redemption at the end. It fails, in my opinion, because the dramatic core of the movie is as earnest, unlikely and melodramatic as the plots of most $3.98 remainder novels. Fred Zinnemann directed some well-crafted movies such asThe Day of the JackalandHigh Noon (Collector's Edition). He also made a number of highly popular, long and dull movies. What makes Act of Violence interesting is the performances of the two leads, Van Heflin and Robert Ryan. Both were fine actors.Heflin plays Frank Enley, a successful small town businessman with an attractive wife and a small child. He's a nice guy with a secret that leaves him in turmoil. Robert Ryan plays Joe Parkson, Enley's worst nightmare. In a German POW camp Enley betrayed a group of men who were planning to escape. He thought he had a promise that nothing would happen to the men. They were, of course, all shot. Parkson somehow survived. Now, after the war, Parkson has only one purpose in life...to find Frank Enley and make him pay with his life for what he did.If it weren't for Heflin's earnest desperation and furrowed angst, something he did better than most actors, and Ryan's fierce anger and internalized tenseness, something he did better than most, we'd have a long slog until we reach the point where final payment is made and life, we hope, can go on. The movie, for me, seems more and more contrived and trivial as the time goes by.Heflin is probably not thought about much nowadays. He was very good, in my opinion, as the hapless Charles Bovary inMadame Bovary (1949), the hardworking Joe Starrett inShane, and the determined and nervous Dan Evans in3:10 to Yuma (Special Edition). He didn't have the looks, as he pointed out himself (think of an honorable-looking, reasonably handsome J. Edgar Hoover, if that's possible), so he concentrated on his acting. Ryan, on the other hand, is usually recognized as one of film's outstanding lead and character actors. For subtlety and vulnerability, tryOn Dangerous Ground; for nastiness, tryBad Day at Black Rock; for deliberate evil, tryBilly Budd; for tired resignation, tryThe Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition).Mystery Street (1950):When the body is found on the beach, no one knows except us who it is. We know it's a cheap, no-good call girl named Vivian Helton because we watched her, desperate for money, meet the man who owed her, and who shot her. Now she's not only lost her looks, she's lost her flesh. Sand and waves have left nothing but bones. The cop in charge, Lieutenant Pete Morales (Ricardo Montalban), calls on Dr. McAdoo (Bruce Bennett), a forensic scientist at Harvard, to help with identification. In the process of establishing sex, age, height and occupation (possible dancer, not probable call girl), we'll get a lesson in forensics that would do credit to Kay Scarpetta or the Skeleton Detective himself, Gideon Oliver.Then the police learn Vivian Helton was pregnant. Pete Morales, working his first case in Boston, had earlier made up his mind that Vivian was murdered before there was evidence to establish this. Now he's determined to find the murderer. Morales is a good guy...smart, ambitious, cheerful, hard working. But when he decides someone is guilty, he's not about to change his mind. Before he gets things right, he'll get things wrong.Along the way we'll meet Henry Shanway, the poor drunk sap who met Vivian at a bar while he was feeling sorry for himself. He let her move his yellow Ford from a no-parking zone. The next thing he knew they were on the Cape, where she tricked him out of the car so she could drive off and meet the man who will shoot her. We'll meet Henry's wife, too. There's Vivian's eccentric and venal landlady (played by Elsa Lanchester), who thinks she can pick up the blackmailing where Vivian left off. And, of course, there's the killer. Most importantly, perhaps, there's McAdoo. Turns out that with his knowledge of bones, bullet angles and logic, he's a better detective than anyone else.The movie benefits from the moody cinematography of John Alton and the efficient direction of John Sturges, Sturges moved on to direct such successes as Last Train from Gun Hill, The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape and Ice Station Zebra. Mystery Street is a solid entry. It's not an A movie, but it's interesting, unsentimental, well made and shorter.",Act of Violence / Mystery Street
186028,"The time-honored ""man and woman stuck on a desert island"" scenario is served up with a heaping tablespoon of class struggle and an acidic twist of sexual politics in this controversial 1975 film from Italian director Lena Wertmuller. A shrill and haughty bourgeoisie woman (Mariangela Melato) charters a yacht cruise for herself and her equally obnoxious fascist friends, who all seem to delight in belittling their slovenly deck hand (Giancarlo Giannini), who is a card-carrying communist. Fate and circumstance conspire to strand Melato and Giannini together on a small Mediterranean isle, setting the stage for some interesting role reversal games (with definite S&M overtones, I should warn you). This film has a polarizing effect on viewers, which I think can be attributed to its fascinating feminist dilemma: How does one react to an obviously talented and self-assured female director with unmistakably misogynist leanings? BTW, in case you are curious about the Guy Ritchie/Madonna remake? Two words: Stay away.",Swept Away

In the  Galsworthy novel, we only see the wife through Soames' eyes, but she is  made into the protagonist of the movie, with motivations noble enough to  suit tedious Greer Garson, who ends up yet again with Mr. Miniver, Walter  Pidgeon.

377402,"&quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot; is one of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;'s more controversial stories.  Taken from Season 22, right before the show got cancelled (albeit briefly), it's unusually dark and violent.  This was at the beginning of the short-lived Colin Baker 6th Doctor era, whose darker take on the title role caused some audience acceptance problems.  &quot;Varos&quot; is then a worthwhile choice for the first 6th Doctor story to be released on DVD, while not the best story available.Given the &quot;Restoration Team&quot; treatment, &quot;Varos&quot; is notably lacking in the care and attention given to the extra features that made, for example, &quot;Aztecs&quot; and &quot;Caves of Androzani&quot; such outstanding DVD acquisitions.  There are no production featurettes here, no behind-the-scenes interviews with cast members or the production crew.  3 features simply dump raw video footage without any explanation.  The &quot;outtakes&quot; and the &quot;behind-the-scenes featurette&quot; basically show the same thing... aborted takes with a PA calling cast members &quot;darling&quot; and &quot;love&quot; a lot.  The extended/deleted scenes montage, while satisfyingly long (10 minutes), doesn't offer any context to those scenes would have fit into the story, as was done on the far more professional &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; presentation.  Baffingly, one audio tracks allows you to watch the complete episode... without incidental music or sound effects.  I'm not sure who would sit through 90 minutes of this.Fortunately, the audio commentary track is well above-average.  Many DW stories are narrated by aging cast members who barely remember their time on the show; not here.  Colin Baker is well-versed in his character's mythology, and is able to walk the audience through the particularly controversial scene in which the Doctor seemingly shoves a security guard into a vat of boiling acid.  From a production standpoint, he attempts to explain why this scene isn't as bad as it appears.  Nicola Bryant (Peri) doesn't say much (and she didn't on the &quot;Caves of Androzani&quot; DVD either), but Nabil Shaban (Sil, an anatomically-correct slug sitting on a fishtank) shows himself to be a real &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan, and tells some funny on-the-set stories as well (such as the time when, in costume, he was mistaken for an inanimate prop!).  Both Baker and Shaban together may come across a bit smug, as they deride &quot;reality TV&quot; and &quot;post-Thatcherite economics&quot;, but they both provide excellent, funny context for the story.  &quot;Varos&quot; becomes one of the few DW DVDs so far with an audio commentary worth playing more than once.James Bond fans who purchase the disc will be interested to note that &quot;Varos&quot; marks the TV debut of Jason Connery, son of Sean.  He doesn't have a whole lot to do here -- he plays a no-nonsense rebel who goes shirtless most of the way -- but it's interesting to note that his chest is nearly as hairy as his dad's.",Doctor Who - Vengeance on Varos VHS

You would think that someone in  Deakin's position would have been through so many psyche screenings someone  would have known he's not intirely stable.  But if you can get past all  that, Broken Arrow can be rather entertaining. Travolta plays the  sociopathic Deakin's very cooly. His acting in this is nothing less than  fantastic.

On  the positive side, there is a catching story line (upright captain has to  fight his best friend in order to keep him from setting off a nuclear  bomb). The action is good.

Season Five, felt almost as though the writers knew the series was ending and they didn't need to 'try' so hard to pull it off. Several characters change radically: Daisy becomes a nagging shrew, and kitchenmaid Ruby shows a 'spark' of the original character design in that she is a bit 'larcenous,' (claiming in the end, that she planned to outlive Mr. Hudson and Mrs. Bridges and inherit the business).Favorite episode was: &quot;Will they no come back again?&quot; where the staff and master James and the rest go to Scotland for vacation. Hudson manages to handle things with his usual aplomb and dignity, and the staff are forced to confront a mysterious 'ghost.'The ending, I felt was sad and almost 'tacked on.'

1148503,"The packaging: very nice. It's organized very well, and the box is surprisingly durable. It's also a great space saver, as individual season box sets (1 - 8) would take up substantially more room than this all-in-one box set.My one criticism of the packaging is that, included is the script for the last episode, which is bound with little brass rivets. The rivets unfortunately have a tendency to catch on the lip of the box when removing it or putting it back in. Also, the accompanying episode guide has a brown paper ""cover protector"" (like on high school textbooks) and that cover also has a bad habit of catching on the lip of the box, creating little tears. But these are minor inconveniences, and as long as you remember them, you can remove the items carefully and prevent any damage from being done.I'm giving this 3 stars not because of the actual box set (which I was very impressed with) but because of the show itself. This show was a lot funnier when I was a teenager and I didn't yet understand all of the tired TV tropes that were used on this show - the token stupid foreigner, the token hot girl(s), etc. I loved the detail that was put in the show, especially how the sets were designed, and the guest stars they brought in (which were frequently 70's TV stars) was a great touch. I hate to say this, but it was the characters that spoiled the show for me; or rather, the main characters. Eric was too arrogant and treated everyone around him like some sort of servant; Michael was too stupid and slapstick to be likeable; Fez was less of a character and more just one long, racist joke; Jackie was just as annoying as Eric, but smaller in size; and Donna, like Fez, was less of a character and just one long, sexually-objectifying joke. Hyde was the only bearable character, and that's because he didn't have the requisite unbearably annoying personality ""quirk"" that every other character had. It was the supporting characters - the parents, basically - that were at all sympathetic as characters.So I feel torn on the show, as I love the premise, and I greatly admire the detail that went into the show, but I felt so little empathy for the main characters that it was difficult to really engage with the storylines.",N/A

He's resisted temptation (in physical form of Hurt) for two years, but one night he gives into his urges and kills again.It's hard to read into this too deeply, because the story eventually becomes convoluted and a little too hoaky.  Demi Moore is the ambicious policewoman after him, dealing with her own personal issues (the cheating husband she is slugging it out in divorce court with, her boss, her father, etc.).  A man across the street from the house where Mr.Books murders a couple just happens to be taking pictures and attempts to blackmail Mr.Brooks into teaching him how to.  Mr.Brook's daughter returns from college, announcing that she is dropping out and clearly hiding something from her family.  Here Mr.Brooks attempts to play several roles.  He is the father trying to make everything alright for his daughter; but, I guess if your father is a serial killer and you as the child have inherited his need to kill, the only solution is to kill someone else at the college and lead the police investigation someplace else.  When Mr.Smith chooses someone to kill, you know who he chooses is going to somehow interlock with the rest of the story.  And the circumstances about Demi Moore's father issues are just a rip off of Clarice Starling (just like every movie with a female cop has been since).It is a good movie.  It makes some valid points about addiction and how people are willing to do anything and everything to satisfy their wants.  Still, it was a little too complicated and a little too hoaky to be considered very good.",Mr. Brooks

946187,"Its a detractor that promotional reviews and moviedoms promotional bandwagon've spilt it up that the movie's about Clones- whence it would've granted moviegoers a better feel for the film if it weren't so.It've done me good that I've a momentary lapse of memory about this when I went to see the film last night.Peculiarly it opens much too similarly with the set up and all the conceptual contexts of George Lucas' first flick and short project film THX1138 (which coincidentally I've just recentl;y purchased along with Michael Todd's AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS (and on another note having bought also quite only recently Pearl Jam's Mike McReady's side project with other band members from other bands called THE ROCKFORDS (which featured HEART (now LOVEMONGERS)'s Nancy Wilson (said to be one of the most dangerous wimmen along with Imelda Marcos accd to MotorCity Madman Ted Nuge(nt)(see all the thematical synchronicities?)))) have in their album's last track a song called 'Island' which lingered over and over in my head for days now); Part Gatacca and BLADE RUNNER- the movie also incorporated some parts on its set up of the year 2031(?) much similar with the likes of METROPOLIS ( a flick i found out's again missed by me as shown just last week hacked with a lokal band as such) or FUTURAMA for that matter. Plotwise our hero, the guy who played young Kenobi went into a similar process of gradually finding/witnessing out about the truth behind their so-called decontamination confinement, much like when Heston underwent to find out what SOYLENT GREEN (the movie title)- a bisquit essential to contain enough of the required nutrients for the starving masses of the future- are made out of.Just watched the flick last night on my way to a nightshift's work. And although I nearly fell asleep by the half of it- yep that escape scene with Ewan's character's found out love interest played by Scarlett Johansson - which commmences after the first half of the entire film's duration quite on the way throughout the rest of the film - I still comprehended it somehow..I think its just a hard thing to pin down about the movie, other than how it is that the Futuristic LAPD are depicted to've find it hard and even unattainable to capture two naivette clonies despite all of their heavy artillery and high technological armaments, (that I guess which only depicted how stupid these LA Cops and SWAT teams are in the film); which all along , the truck where Ewan and his girlfriend character hopped on a truck full of metal carriage that they found as their means for escape from these ants of chasing military people seems so hard to be convincing that with all of the racket going on about - how come the truck driver never found the idea to stop?? Perhaps the driver is so saturated on headphones with the music of the Steve Miller band while driving on his shades with a dark glassed front for a truck!The other great Clone fiction that there is IS the Spiderman Clone saga that began in the seventies and welled its way by '96 - which according to what i heard have folded disasterously like the franchise of DC's BATMAN movie series commenced by director Tim Burton.Next stop: the movie STEALTH",N/A
388026,"The film could have (and should have) been better.  Especially since it was written by Ron Moore and Brannon Bragga who wrote the far-superior follow-up &quot;First Contact&quot; 2 years later.The films good  points: excellent special effects, fine acting, and an engaging musical  score (especially for Dennis McCarthy, a television composer).  I  especially enjoyed seeing the Enterprise crashing into the planet's  surface-something I have always wanted to see in a &quot;Star Trek&quot;  film (I was also pleased to see that cruise ship trashed).  I also enjoyed  Picard's speech at the end concering our own mortality.The negative  points: as was the case with &quot;The Next Generation&quot; TV show (and  now with &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Insurrection&quot;) this film  utilized a great deal of techno-babble.  The subplot involving Data's  emotion chip was pointless but I was strongly  amused with his profane  reaction to the Enterprise being in danger.Regarding Kirk, I can't  help but feel as if the film would have been more dramatic if Kirk's  idealized life in the Nexus had involved a life with his son David whom he  never really knew until shortly before his untimely death in  &quot;ST3&quot;.  Imagine Picard trying to pull Kirk away from that.I  was also disappointed with the fact that Kirk didn't interact with other  &quot;Next Generation&quot; members other than Picard. Finally Kirk's death  (no surprise-everyone knew about it long before the scene was even filmed)  just wasn't dramatic enough.

1122209,"""The Half Blood Prince"" should be called ""The Half Cocked Film."" Books aside, the film leaps, jumps and bounces about from darkness to glee in artistic, engaging and dramatically potent form, but in the end may leave the viewer scratching their heads.Fans of the books KNOW what's going on, moviegoers may be a bit confused as the why things happen. For one, the film opens with Ginny and Harry madly in unspoken love as Ginny snogs Dean Thomas anyway, and Hermione is suddenly infatuated with Ron - sure, there has been tension between hem since puberty, but jealousy seems a bit of a stretch all of a sudden (in the books it's more of a slow brewing issue.)Without too many spoilers, ask yourself: how and why does Harry know what and for what use a Beazor is and why does his potions master (not Snape now) sit and watch a student die when the solution should be clear to him? Why is there no defenses at the Weasely house if they are in dire danger, why no Order members standing guard, no spells around the property and why do the Death Eaters attack? (hint, it's not in the book at all!!! so there's no answer.) Why does Dumbledore take Harry to the Burrow at the beginning of the film (it makes sense in the book, here, no reason.) Why does Harry take orders from Snape at the end without question? Why does no one challenge four Death Eaters running amok in Hogwarts and setting Hagrid's hut ablaze?The movie is fast, humorous, entertaining and a wonder to watch, both emotionally and visually. I buy the characters, the motivations, the special effects, everything almost... just not the logical flaws that made me scratch my head all the way home.I do hope they shot a lot of scenes that will someday make up an extended DVD /  Blu-Ray version. The film is so close to being the perfect Potter film, but forgets the audience isn't stupid.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
948574,"This is the second movie from director Gael Morel I have watched recently. The first one being ""Full Speed."" I rated ""Full Speed"" poorly. By watching this second movie, I understand why. I feel this director is very unorthodox in his expression of gay issues, and by being not familiar with his style of directing, am missing the point of what is being presented.His stories are about a bunch of people, mostly men, in a particular point of their lives. There is no main gay theme. These people could be gay or straight. There is violence in one or two of the characters. He is very much appreciative of the human male form, as all of his actors are very athletic, good looking, perfect bodies (no nerds.) He also makes an emphasis on Arab men, particularly from Algeria, North Africa.This movie revolves around three brothers, Marc, Christophe, and Olivier (the youngest.) Their mother had died painfully and all the boys missed her terribly. Christophe is in jail. He comes out of jail toward the middle of the movie and joins the family (he is straight.) There is one more boy, Hicham, an Arab young boy who is gay and friend of Marc. This boy becomes romantically involved with Olivier. Olivier being the only gay som in the family (he loose his virginity to Hicham without any of the other brothers knowing.) I am not sure what Marc is.Marc gets into trouble with the local thugs (drug dealers) because he owes them money. He gets beaten by them and he is forced to throw his prize dog over a cliff to the town river. I almost turn the movie off as I am an animal lover (I don't think there was any cruelty to the animal, it is just part of the story.) Marc wants revenge and to kill the thug who hurt him and kill his dog. He wants his brother Christophe to help him but he refuses. He then becomes bitter towards his brother. Toward the end of the movie, Marc gets hurt seriously by attempting to run over his nemesis, he misses his target totally, hitting a tree in the process. His anger got the best of him.Christophe gets a job in town after his release from jail and he gets promoted right way, and he finds a girl who is going to marry him, and his life seems to be progressing nicely. Hicham dumps Olivier (I do not know why) after using him. Hicham is a dancer and teaches Oliver the art. Olivier becomes real good (competitive). Marc becomes paralyzed but makes a struggling recovery. The final scene shows Olivier going into a building with a hand gliding instructor. Hicham has taught him to hand glide.Even though I found this movie to be better than ""Full Speed"", the plot was again somewhat confusing. These are not your ordinary ""gay"" movies. The scene of the three brothers, in an interlocking position, sleeping naked, is very provocative and erotic, talking about brotherly love (the father was totally mesmerized watching.)The movie near the French Alps making the scenery rather beautiful.",Three Dancing Slaves

1080393,"This version of Dracula offers an alternative version of the Bram Stoker novel to the Christopher Lee/Hammer Films genre.  Louis Jourdan, as Dracula, offers a more subdued, less menacing Dracula than that provided by Mr. Lee (I have to say that I prefer Mr. Lee's interpretation or Jack Palance's in Dan Curtis' production).  The ensemble cast is good and as with all the presentations of the Dracula novel, some of the characters presented in the book are merged into one (in this case, the Quincy Morris character has taken over Lord Holmwood's and Mina Murray has become Lucy Westenra's sister and not her best friend).  Frank Finlay stands out as Van Helsing.  The production speeds up toward the end.  It would have been a better production had it followed the novel and allotted more time to the tracking down of the Count.  In short, the BBC production is competent but not particularly inspired.

1517226,"Natalie Dessay is an artist whom I admire greatly for her singing, acting, intelligence and musicianship.  This performance is ample reason why.  Here is a well-sung and compelling acted performance of one of opera's more challenging roles.  At times I thought her characterization was a bit edgy - on the verge in a manner more suited to Lucia than to Violetta - but, still, it's a thoughtful and valid portrayal.  Her singing is technically brilliant (as in ""Sempre libera"") and deeply moving (""Addio del passato"") where needed.  I was particularly pleased that she takes both verses of both her arias.  The last several performances of I've seen in the theatre have used these erstwhile traditional cuts.Miss Dessay is well-matched in the Alfredo of Charles Castronovo.  He has a pleasing lyric voice and shows a commendable empathy for a not altogether sympathetic character.  His singing is tasteful and involved, though he does come close to losing the high C at the end of his second act cabaletta.The most serious drawback to this performance is the Giorgio Germont of Ludovic Tezier.  To my ears, at least, his voice is dry and colourless and his technique a bit dicey.  Add to this that he shows about as much emotion as if he were singing listings from the telephone directory and you'll understand the damage he does in the great second act scena with Violetta.  He's no better in his briefer appearances later in the opera.Even the comprimarios are a pretty sorry lot.  It's obvious why these persons are singing with the principals and not as the principals.  Perhaps Mr. Tezier would have been better with them.The updated setting adds nothing to the work and detracts slightly from it.  I'd like the opera to be about persons who are a bit more sophisticated than the bottle-chugging partiers in the first scenes of the first and second acts.  The pointless, though pleasant, choruses of gypsies and matadors in Act 2, Scene 2 seem even more pointless than usual.  Perhaps worst is Violetta's standing-up death, followed by a little stroll across the stage after she's been pronounced dead.On the whole, I would recommend this only for Miss Dessay's Violetta with some additional enjoyment from Mr Castronovo's Alfredo.  As a first, or only, DVD of this opera, I'd go with the Georg Solti version from Covent Garden.",Verdi: La Traviata

147268,"It's Jim Belushi's acting that saves this film, yet his character is too dumb to be credible, as is the premise of the film.  He's a vicious corrupt cop who doesn't check anything twice, just shoots and doesn't ask any questions--later or at any time.  Yet because of Belushi's strong acting talents, his character is almost believable.He and his partner, played by a wildly overacting Tupac Shakur, have a nasty profitable scam going:  they set up trades with drug dealers, then kill the latter for the drugs which they can sell again.  Here's another problem--any money cops use for set ups has to be authorized by higher ups, then accounted for.  There's no mention of that in the film; how do they get away with keeping the money?  It's also mentioned that they've pulled this 11 times.  OK, so after all those times, NOBODY on the force investigates how it is that so many drug dealers have died after a set up put in place by the same two cops over and over?  Also not credible.The two thug cops kill a drug dealer who turns out to be an undercover DEA agent and fellow DEA guy Gary Cole pulls in and starts hassling the precinct for answers.  Cole also overacts here; he's a caricature, not a character.However, as an upscale attorney, James Earl Jones does a fine job, as does Dennis Quaid as a surprising suspect the thug cops have framed for the murder of the DEA agent.  Yet the surprise that comes with discovering Quaid's real identity is another plot point that severely strains credibility.The film seems to be a collection of characters thrown together to flesh out a collection of random, often non-credible, and distinctly unrelated story segments that have not been thought through.  Even the ending is disappointing--you can smell it coming a mile away.In spite of all the above, this is not a bad film because the pacing and momentum are strong enough--along with the acting of Belushi, Jones, and Quaid--to carry it through to its predictable end.  Belushi is on screen most of the time and he's a lot of fun to watch.  You're thinking no cop can be that dumb, but his acting chops make you feel that if a guy could be this crude and vicious, then, OK, maybe he COULD be that dumb.A truly mixed bag.

Then she gets a record dropped off at the radio station. She plays the record on air while an author who wrote a book about witches is the on air guest. Spoiler Alert. I was onboard at this point but the train derailed. The film had an old school 1970's supernatural movie feel. It wasn't supposed to be gory just that creepy the witches/devil are out there plotting something. Things took a bad turn when the screen flashed with some Scooby Doo psychedelic stuff promoting the radio show the main character worked on. Then the scene with the witches being burned. Everyone knows a witch has never been burned in Salem or the US. Burning witches was a European thing. The Salem witches were hanged. Salem is as close to Halloween Town in the Nightmare Before Christmas as any place in the US. The Bewitched statue was shown but that was about all the viewer got to see of Salem. It was definitely shot on location. The old buildings are there. There is an old graveyard in Salem where the crypts are practically crumbling with weird skeleton angels on the graves. That could have made a great scene. When Rob Zombie stays closer to reality or at least something that could happen it is gold. Devil's Rejections, that could really happen and that is why it is so scary. Dealing with witches and devils cannot go off into campy or it is not scary. Did Hocus Pocus scare anyone? The scenes which some reviewers thought were art do not work in a horror film. I think it was Halloween 2 where Michael Myers and his mother are in a field and are dancing around as if they are on a LSD trip, it did not work. The author investigating the witches could have been played up more. The witches were not scary. Three old broads drinking down some tea every five seconds reminded me of Murder She Wrote. The opening scene witches who came back throughout the movie where kinda scary. The scene with the devils touching themselves was beyond lame. The lobster baby that the DJ gives birth to looked like they got it out of the tank at Red Lobster. The fat devil child had no connection to the movie and was super cartoony. Near the end, the movie melted down into a crazy bunch of images that just did not fit and did not help the story. The end was pretty good as it was mixed in with the credits. It was the old newscaster voice summing things up. Because in the last 20 seconds the viewer gets that, the music is being played for the descendants of the Judge and the townspeople who killed the witches. Until that point, it was only clear the descendant of the Judge was to bear the lobster baby. The other women being brought to slaughter could have been move of the movie. The Judge and the townspeople who were in on the hangings are buried in a cemetery in the middle of Salem with these creepy old trees. That could have been used.

And there's a truly wonderful sequence where Edward Norton (non-Hulk mode) does his best Matt Damon impression and has a Jason Bourne-esque chase sequence through the slums of Brazil.Norton does a great job portraying Bruce Banner's desperation, but Jennifer Connely is sorely missed as Banner's paramour. Tim Roth does a decent job as the film's main villain, Abomination as well. Fans are also introduced to two other key Hulk comic book characters throughout the course of the film (I won't mention names here lest I spoil the surprise for Hulk fans).However, I will say the film has a very intriguing end  shot of Edward Norton that shakes up a bit what the traditional Hulk mythos has been.

1113416,"After watching the season finale of season 6 with the introduction of Bizarro, I was excited believing the CW writers would step-up and transform Clark Kent from the not-so mild-mannered farm boy (that is more in tune with John Byrne's adaptation that Siegel and Shusters) into the caped Man of Steel that we've all been waiting for.  Instead, the writers went on strike.  When they came back, they put-together a mis-match bundle of episodes that made myself and other comic fans and scholars cringe.To myself and others, season six was the pinnacle of the series, especially with the ""Justice League"" episode where the team walks away from the ruble with serious expressions knowing their work has just begun.  THAT was awesome and, to me, it should have been where Clark Kent began to develop into the Man of Steel.  Instead, season seven went in complete reverse and brought the franchise back to it's roots; teen drama.  Granted that is what the WB (Now CW) is known for but the original four seasons were to show Clark Kent's high school years; when that theme ran it's course the producers decided to explore the early transformation of Clark Kent into the Man of Steel but that theme has gone on and on... and on for about three seasons and now season seven retrogresses back into teen drama once again.The teen-drama begins with Kara (AKA Supergirl), Clark's cousin from Krypton.  Now, Supergirl was introduced in the 1950s to entice younger readers with what historian Bradford Wright calls ""silly stories.""  In this regard, the CW sticks true to the comics as Kara's stories right from the start are exactly that starting with a Miss Smallville beauty contest.  The distrust and arguments from Clark to Kara are somewhat true to the comics although their back and forth badgering spanning several episodes got annoying and her character development seemed to be more on her revealing outfits.  It's obvious they didn't hire Laura Vandervort (Kara) for her good acting or bright ideas.  Then again, with the exception of Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor), the same can be said of the entire cast.The next element of annoying teen drama was the back-and-forth love story of Clark and Lana Lang.  Now, anyone remotely familiar with the Superman mythos knows Superman is destined to be with Lois Lane and Lana was more of a childhood crush to help with the back story rather than be a recurring character.  For the sake of the first four Smallville seasons, this meant Lana had to stay and rightfully so.  Problem is, even with Clark Kent ""maturing"" after his graduation from high school, Lana wouldn't leave, the drama intensified, and she actually became a detested character.  Lana's constant trust then mistrust of Clark was more akin to a bad soap opera than intriguing drama.  Thank GOD she's gone!On top of that, without Clark Kent even dreaming of becoming the Man of Steel, he has fought several primary villains from the Superman franchise such as General Zod (which was poorly done), Brainiac, and Bizarro.  Now I hear Clark Kent, not Superman, will face Doomsday in season 7 the villain that ""killed"" Superman in 1993.To compensate for a lack of Superman development, the writers decided to use some creative liberties and introduced a group called ""Veritas,"" a secret society that knows a ""secret"" on how to control ""the traveler"" AKA Clark Kent.  Now, I loved that they brought Robert Picardo (known as The Doctor on Star Trek: Voyager) as a guest star on an episode or two, but the Veritas conspiracy essentially seemed more of the same trust/mistrust style story that just had a Latin name.To me, however, the largest complaints of the series is the horrible insertions of commercial advertisements into the show.  The episode ""Hero"" was nothing but a 42-minute long advertisement for Stride Gum under the guise of bringing back the 'beloved' character Pete Ross.  Ross even goes as far as to hold up a container of Stride Gum with a smile on his face.  Last time I saw something that blatant was a parody of advertising in Wayne's World.  The show also inserted numerous Toyota references, especially to the Yaris.  Granted in one episode in season six Chloe gives Clark her keys and says, ""Take the Yaris,"" not realizing the head space in one of those cars would not be sufficient to allow actor Thomas Welling (who is easily over six feet tall) to drive comfortably.  Believe me, I've sat in one and I'm 6'5.Now, despite all my criticisms I do have some compliments on season seven and these pluses will push me to purchase the series!The episode ""Apocalypse"" where Clark witnesses a world without him, while being an obvious rip-off of It's a Wonderful Life, has an interesting yet subtle message embedded into it.  It shows Clark Kent trying to blend in by being bumbly, wearing a traditional dark suit with thick glasses, and showing affection for Lois.  To me, this shows what Smallville would look like if they went from what they are to what many critics are demanding they become and I gotta tell ya, aside from the nuclear missiles I liked what I saw.  This was Thomas Welling's debut as a director and I thought he did an excellent job portraying himself as what Clark Kent SHOULD be.  I think the CW writers should move towards this mindset minus the nuclear Armageddon.The next episode I really liked was ""Action"" where an action film purposefully made to look like the Superman franchise is being filmed in Smallville.  This episode was made in response to various fans, such as myself, criticizing Lana Lang's character as antiquated and unnecessary demanding that she be booted off the show.  While this episode makes a strong reference to the disaster on the set of The Crow, it still takes an almost humorous jab at it's critics, so kudos to the writers for that episode.After all is said and done, I can barely recommend this season to Smallville fans; it retrogresses back to teen drama and bores the audience with back and forth drama that resembles a cheesy soap opera than a comic-based show.  However, it does have some quality points that fairly redeem it in my eyes and I hope the writers, now back from the strike, will shape up or ship out as I will watch season eight with a heightened sense of scrutiny.",N/A

136466,"In 1855, England was near the height of its power. Industrialization had transformed the country, its empire stretched across most of the world, and high-speed rail was an established fact of life. In the midst of this Victorian order, Edward Pierce conceived and executed perhaps the most daring robbery up to that point in time.  Specifically, he and his confederates set out to steal 25,000 pounds in gold bullion from a moving train protected by every form of security available in that age.This is something of a pet project for Michael Crichton.  First he wrote the novel,The Great Train Robbery, and then he wrote and directed this adaptation.  As one might expect, the movie largely stays true to the book except for some trimming to help keep the film from running too long.  The tone is fairly tongue-in-cheek and the plot moves along at a good pace.The cast is largely populated with unknowns, though there are two obvious exceptions.  Sean Connery takes center stage as Pierce and does an adequate, though highly understated, job of filling the role.  Donald Sutherland plays his primary aide, Agar, and gives the part with a suitable touch of goofiness without going overboard.  The no-names all do creditably jobs of filling their roles but none stand out.Those who love a good heist should enjoy The Great Train Robbery.  Some of the intricacy is lost in the translation to film, but it's still very solid.  One complaint is that there is a fair amount of 19th century slang and criminal jargon that can be tough to follow and is never explained or translated for 21st century viewers.  It also seemed to me that Crichton might not have been the best director for this movie.  It's very ""by the numbers"" and lacks any real verve.  When you look at the plot, I see no reason why this couldn't be every bit as enjoyable asThe Sting, but it's not even in the same league.  There isn't enough sense of fun, and more emphasis on the intricacy of the planning would have made the crime seem more impressive.This is not a bad movie, and worth giving a try if you enjoy heists.  Sean Connery doesn't give his most memorable performance, but his many fans should enjoy seeing him play the rogue.  As long as you watch this with measured expectations, it's a pleasant way to spend two hours.",N/A

1235334,"Man Hunt, 1941 filmThe movie begins somewhere in Germany before WW II. A man with a rifle walks thru the woods. He aims at a high government official. A guard jumps on him to spoil his shot, and he is captured. His equipment is British. Capt. Alan Thorndike is questioned. Thorndike says it was a ""sporting stalk"". Is this a symbol of English decadence? Thorndike will be set free if he admits he was a government assassin. A refusal means he will be taken away for torture. Will he sign a confession? No. Will they make it look like an accident? The next morning they find the rifle but not Thorndike's body. Dogs are sent to scent his whereabouts. Walking thru water kills his scent. A boat searches the lake. Thorndike finds a Danish ship and hides in a closet. It will sail to London with a stowaway. A man watches him leave then signals to other German spies in London. Is he trapped?Thorndike enters a house for refuge from the men following him. He asks a woman for cash, he can't travel on foot. A taxi cab takes him to his brother's mansion with Jerry Stokes. Who is after him? Can he be extradited to Germany? They know he is there. Jerry brings him ""fish and chips"" to eat. Will Jerry travel with him? She will be safer alone. A watcher releases a messenger pigeon. Thorndike tells Farnsworthy to not believe any report os a ""suicide"", then leaves by the back entrance. He is followed to the train, and afterwards. There is a struggle with a tail. The victim was identified as Thorndike by his passport. The police are looking for a man with a scar on his cheek. Thorndike says goodbye to Jerry. A Bobby separates them. Jerry returns home to find unexpected visitors who want to chat. When ""D. F. Stokes"" arrives at the Lyme Regis Post Office there is a complication. He returns to his hide-out, a cave. The letter carries a threat.He was followed! He is sealed up as in a grave. They want Thorndike alive, so he can sign a confession ""A lie is relative, as is truth."" He is given the beret owned by Jerry. She refused to talk, and was found dead in the street. The police called it a suicide. They want Thorndike's confession for a ""White Paper"" to justify the war. ""Tomorrow the whole world."" Thorndike improvises a primitive weapon. [Any animal that takes refuge in a cave is trapped.] Is he free at last? Next they show scenes of the start of WW II. Thorndike is in the RAF. He parachutes into Germany with a precision rifle and has a mission to accomplish. [Implausible, given the Gestapo's system of checking on passports etc.]This movie was derived from Geoffrey Household's novel ""Rogue Male"", who also wrote other best-selling books. I remember the book being better than the movie. This has some implausible scenes about German spies in Britain. ""The Double Cross System"" tells how about the efficient British Secret Service. Every German spy sent into Britain was captured, then doubled, imprisoned, or executed. There were other books as well. They had a ""Most Secret Source"" that provided reliable information. ""The Two-Headed Spy"" movie tells about their cleverness.",Man Hunt

566492,"This is a fun movie about a special child, in appearance autistic but in fact gifted in uniquely special ways.  Her aunt, Kim Bassinger, accepts responsibility for her and, only later, encounters a secretive organization that wants to control the child for its own ends.  With a good cop, Smits, she rises to the occasion, in the process reexamining her life and faith.The strongest point of the film is the acting.  Bassinger is not a sex symbol, but a normal woman who is desperate to save a loved one.  Her sister is movingly portrayed as a troubled addict, while the evil protagonist is truly frightening.  Smits is also excellent as a priest turned cop, having found ""another way to serve him.""  The chemistry of these characters works extremely well.  The child is also eminently believable.In addition, though dated the special effects are quite evocative, esp. at the end.  I don't want to give away the plot:  suffice it to say that even though I am a non-believer, I was moved, at times terrified, always interested.  The atmospherics of the film are especially powerful.On the weaker side, the plot was a bit far-fetched, full of chance encounters and desperate moves that didn't quite ring true to me.Recommended.",Bless the Child

I did not know Rosinni had created their prototype!  And unfortunately, that's what Comte Ory reminds me of. It may be a ""comic masterpiece"", but it was written for a country that not long before this opera was guillotining nuns (See Dialogues of the Carmelites).  Thus, I find it, as a work, offensive, and am not surprised it has taken so long to enter the contemporary repertoire.  Contrary to what Berlioz and others may have thought, I am convinced the pinnacle of Rossini's comic operas is the triad of  L'Italiana in Algieri, Il Turco in Italia and the Barber of Seville.

While this would have stood on its own merits; I think it pales in comparison to the original film and its place in the trilogy.

1158119,"The movie blatantly ties together the difficulties of being the new kid at school and being the out teen. I don't quite see why the movie had to be set in some version of Europe given the only venues that we see in this movie are limited to the school, Chance's house and the drag bar for the most part. Setting aside, this is ultimately a character-driven story and the venue doesn't really matter. The movie was also set in the 80's, which was presented in terms of some of the fashion choices and the music, but not much else.At the end of the day the story is sort of timeless or appropriate to pretty much any period since coming out was a thing.It's interesting to note that Tad Hilgenbrinck was the same guy who played Matt Stifler in American Pie Presents Band Camp - as in the try-hard player kid who was trying to imitate his brother. So from overconfident douche to determined gay teen - that's an interesting range. He wasn't necessarily amazing in the role, but he did pretty well for himself.The movie has a lot going on with the different characters and their motivations, but never really has the time to fully explore things. Yes, Chance is still the primary character that we need to follow around. And thus we really shouldn't have had too many auxiliary characters. I think the only characters that I wish we had learned more about were Chance's family. For the most part they were just background characters who acted based on stereotypes and not much else.

667062,"While it's a high-action, low-plot film with a creative patchwork of screenplay, Amores Perros is definitely a movie you should watch at least once. It's effortlessly fresh and original.The movie's style is certainly inspired by the stylism of Pulp Fiction or Traffic. That is, it consists of three stories that tie themselves together in the end. This method of film making has become such a clich&eacute;, but it can be done if the director succeeds in making each story equally interesting. Unfortunately, Amores Perros starts with a bang, but its final two stories drag on while the viewer struggles to stay awake. (And it is a looong movie!)The first story of the film is, to say the least, brilliant. It revolves around a young man named Octavio (Gael Bernal) who enters the bizarre world of dog-fighting so he can earn enough money to run away with his abusive brother's wife and child. Things, however, do not go exactly as expected, as the dog-fighting goes terribly wrong, and Octavio's dream of running away is crushed.As far as the first story goes, Inarritu did not wrong. In fact, it's easy to say that this segment of the film is flawlessly executed. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting and the lighting all come together to create quite a spectacle. The fact that Inarritu chose to use this segment first was really a poor decision. When it ends, I was left looking for something at or around the same caliber, and I was greatly disappointed with what came next.The second story concerns a model named Valeria (Goya Toledo) living with a her boyfriend who left his wife just to be with her. The beginning of the story is intriguing, but the ironic coincidence is that when the two lovers' lives begin to fall apart, the movie takes a turn for the worst as well. Instead of the entertaining and fast paced love thriller Amores Perros had been to this point, I was now treated to a obnoxiously slow and boring tale of a degenerative relationship.Story three is, well, better, but that's not saying much. The story revolves around a supposedly mysterious man who gave up his family and life to become a rebel. His rebel days behind him, the man (Emilio Echevarria) is now a bum/assassin for hire who walks around with a pack of dogs. During a 'job' the man rediscovers his former self, and realizes what a grave mistake he had made by leaving his family. This part had vast potential but it's clear that the director did not try to develop this man's character for a sort of mysterious effect. Sadly, I found that I knew so little about the character that I really couldn't care less what his fate was.As a whole, Amores Perros stacks up to be a slightly above average movie. It runs simply far too long, and it does not focus enough on the first story, which is the only thing really carrying the film.But that shouldn't detract you from watching it at least once. It's a very worthy rental if only for the glimpses of directorial brilliance.",Amores Perros

I love Leo Tolstoy and Anna Karenina is one of my favorite books - a beautifully rich story about love, lust, loss, and all things Russian.  With this all said, it's difficult to both not like, and to like, Wright's film.The post-modern approach to setting each scene on a &#34;stage&#34; just didn't work and it actually took away from the important context of the story.  I understand why Wright wanted to do this but it just doesn't work.  The setting of this story has everything to do with who the characters are and why the story is so tragic.  I wanted to see more of the countryside to understand Levin; more of St. Petersburg as the backdrop for Anna and Vronsky's heated attraction.  The weird theater backdrops not only didn't add to the landscape of the story, they took something away from it.I love Aaron Taylor-Johnson.  He was great in Kick Ass (don't be a hater - watch the film.  It's hilarious) and he was wonderful in Albert Nobbs.  The kid can act and he's very good looking.  But Vronksy's character is complex; yes he's a naive kid in many ways, but he's also sophisticated enough to match Anna in wit and in worldliness.  Taylor-Johnson was not old enough for this role and was not convincing.  I think a more experienced actor - maybe someone like Tom Hardy who is wonderful in period works, would have been good.Keira was wonderful.  Her clothes were spectacular; elegantly beautiful.  She was Anna - through and through.  The supporting actors were great too - especially Levin and Kitty.  But where was Levin's story?  The beauty of Anna Karenina is that Tolstoy balances out the story of false love / lust (Anna's affair with Vronsky) with what real love / commitment really are (Levin and Kitty's story).  I wanted more of Levin's story but of course, an almost 800 page book is hard to fit into a 2 to 3 hour film.I think this film is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the novel and or of Joe Wright's work.

Anyway, he tackled this against-type role of rollicking, blue-collar poet Sampson Shillitoe. (Albeit, Gawd knows, Shillitoe is a strutting, bristlingly macho, overloaded-with-testosterone, thoroughly HETEROSEXUAL poet---sort of what Norman Mailer would be if he was a poet & not a prose writer.) When the role was somewhat customized in this way to suit Connery's screen persona, he succeeded in pulling off a bravura comic performance. As previous posters have mentioned, highlights are his hilariously disastrous, drunken recital at some high-society Ladies' Social Club & his explosive display of feeling-the-touch-of-God creative joy on the (Brooklyn?)

597773,"In a seemengly endless parade of mob movies, ""Road to Perdition"" stands out as the most moralistic. It shows, overall, that at the heart of every mob movie, there is a heart. Though masterfully directed by American Beauty director Sam Mendes, with stunning visuals and an intellegent script, ""Road to Perdition"" fails on a few levels, which keeps it from being the masterpiece it might have been.Tom Hanks plays a family man who belongs to two different families, his wife and kids, and as a hitman for his ""father"" (Paul Newman) who is the patriarch of a poweful mob family. Things get heated when his 12 year old son witnesses a hit gone wrong, and a contract is put out on Hanks and his family. They embark on a road trip to escape the mob, save their lives, and start someting new. Hanks's motivation is at the heart of this movie- he doesn't want his son to wind up like him.While this is definitely a great idea on paper, it somewhat suffers in the execution. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, leaving little to sympathize with. The mob family loyalty was not played on as strongly as it could, and the drama was lukewarm at best, relying more on gun battles than character development. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are excellent actors, but their performances here cannot be considered career highlights. Hanks in particular plays a wooden character, and his performance strikes me as a man who would rather be doing something else. The only real standout performance is from Jude Law, who plays a creepy hitman with a morbid obsession for photographing his victims. While I liked the idea, the movie is altogether unsatisfying, for the sole reason that it could have been so much better.The movie might not be a masterpiece, but the Commentary on the DVD is worth the price of admission. Sam Mendes gives some fun and intellegent insight into the movie, how it was made, and gives plenty of interesting anecdotes along the way. The deleted scenes are nothing special, but the ""Making of"" documentary is enjoyable enough. If you liked the movie, the DVD is a nice companion.While this is far from a bad film, it simply doesn't live up to it's potential. It is perhaps this reason why it didn't get much attention at the Oscars.

But with the movie being released on DVD in regular 2D format is it a good movie? Without the comin' at ya type effects, is it any good? The answer is yes and no.If you've been following the series at all you know that the film began with 2 people chained in a run down old subway type bathroom being provided knowledge of how they had wronged people and given a chance to make a choice, one that would involve some great pain or damage, but that would give them the chance to make write their wrongs.The series continued in this vein with the main character of Jigsaw, the culprit who was behind the dangerous torture fueled traps that held each person captive, who in reality was John Kramer (Tobin Bell). It seems that John was diagnosed with an inoperable condition and then treated poorly by everyone from insurance agents to police. With nothing to lose, he set out to help people change their lives, giving them an opportunity to become valued members of society or perish in the process. Talk about tough love.By the time this film opens, John's last assistant has gone on a rampage and disgraced the original intent that John began with. Sure it was crazy, but Det. Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) has taken it into a whole different direction. As seen in the last film, rather than truly offering people a chance to change, he's set out on making the traps inescapable. Instead of a chance it is now out and out murder.It appeared that he was facing death at the hands of John's wife (Betsy Russell) in the last film, but he escaped and is now searching for her as well as setting up a whole new game for Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flannery). It seems that Dagen claimed to be on of Jigsaw's victims, profiting from writing a book about his experience and going on to creating self help groups for other victims as well as a DVD of their meetings.Now Bobby must face Jigsaw for real in the form of Hoffman. And with each new trap we are witness to another form of torture that has the potential to end gruesomely and with much blood spilled. While not quite out and out torture porn, as this genre has been named, the film does have the viewer bear witness to some truly gut wrenching deaths. Perhaps not if you've seen the other films, but anyone just now jumping on may turn their head more often than once.As Hoffman pursues John's wife and sets in motion Bobby's trial by fire, the police are hot on his trail. Tracking him through the clues left behind, they narrow it down. But will the get there in time to prevent another death forever linked to Jigsaw?One thing the movie does offer is the chance for it to truly end. And the surprise ending here was one that caught me off guard and was actually quite satisfying. But it did offer the slightest chance for the series to continue. One can only hope that the makers of this series let it go out on a high note rather than milk it for one last dollar. I mean does anyone really feel the need to pull out JASON GOES TO MANHATTAN? Six films in a series that has only one (in my opinion) truly bad film is something to take pride in.So if you're a fan you'll love this one. If you've come and gone, you'll get a decent solution to the story. The lose ends are tied up nicely by the last minute. The series has a beginning, middle and an end. And the ending offered is satisfactory.",Saw: The Final Chapter
1631649,"&#34;I went into that place to get our son back and something followed me and killed Elise, you saw it.&#34; After Josh Lambert (Wilson) goes into the spirit world to save his son he is shocked when he finds that this event causes the death of the woman trying to help them. When his wife Renai (Byrne) questions what happened she notices a change in Josh. This change begins to effect the entire family and when a group arrives to help the family begins to experience the terror over again. I have stated that it takes a lot to scare me. I'm not saying that to brag I'm just saying that very few movies have scared me. The three that come to mind are Poltergeist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and the first Insidious. That said I was hesitant to see this one because I was worried I would be scared again. On the plus side I wasn't scared at all, on the down side I wasn't entertained by this movie either. The first one was scary to me because of the possession of the little boy and creepy kids scare me a lot. Without trying to give too much away this movie was almost the same thing as the first one but this time Josh was possessed, and because it was an adult acting that way it didn't have the same effect on me. It felt just like another possession movie. I will say that this is still much better then most horror movies that come out but this is no where as good as the first one.

265171,"I remember seeing the ""Special Edition"" of A New Hope in the theaters nearly a decade ago. While I was blown away with seeing a Star Wars film on the big screen, much of the ""special"" material left me with mixed emotions. Then came the rest of the films and by the time I got to the musical scene in Jabba's Palace I was simply depressed. Then came episodes I-III and I slowly began to stop caring at all.The last and only version of Star Wars I bought (and still own) was the VHS boxed set of the original films. So, while I can understand the rage of everyone who has bought a half-dozen versions of these films in the last ten years, I haven't fallen into that particular money pit. I simply preferred to do without the films if they had to be the special editions. I stuck to my dusty VHS tapes.Lucas is clearly out to make as much money as possible from the franchise. That was obvious to me from the moment I left the theater after Episode I. So, I've patiently waited for the originals, flaws and all, to make their way back on the shelves. Now they have and I'll probably pick them up. Though, I can assure you it's only for the ""bonus features"" (i.e. the theatrical releases). The fact that it's weighted down with the ""Special Editions"" and the damage is done to my psyche, those VHS tapes are getting pretty fragile.I'll take the bitter with the sweet.","Star Wars - Episode IV, A New Hope VHS"

1503203,"I've never been a big fan of message movies. It seems far too often the message gets lost in the whims of the director or actor involved and the real story is buried. But occasionally a movie comes along where the story being told, the facts beneath it all, are so strong that they ease their way into you brain and ferment there, taking hold and forcing you to witness what it was all about. THE WHISTLEBLOWER is one such movie.It's 1999 and Rachel Weisz stars as Kathryn Bolkovac, a police woman with problems. Her ex-husband has sued for and won full custody of their daughter and is moving her to Georgia. Kathryn requested a transfer to the Georgia State Police but they don't have any openings at the moment and with a mortgage to worry about she can't just up and move. Then fate steps in and provides her with a chance to make great money for just 6 months work. That job is as a privately run security force connected to the United Nations forces working in Bosnia.Kathryn takes the job thinking she'll just be doing regular police work in another country, helping folks in need and having her back watched by fellow officers. Her first taste of controversy arrives when she comes to the aid of a Muslim woman constantly beaten by her husband. The local police could care less since she's a Muslim. Through her knowledge of law and the with the help of a sympathetic officer, Kathryn gets justice for the woman, a first concerning Muslim women in the area. This comes to the notice of others at the United Nations.Kathryn is offered a chance to work in the Human Rights commission and jumps at the chance. During one of her investigations she learns of a group of young girls who have been severely abused to the point of torture. In talking to them they lead her to investigate a local bar where she finds pictures of the girls being sexually and physically abused in the worst conditions possible. A room with dirty mattresses and chains to hold the girls is found with used condoms and needles strewn around. In checking the pictures she finds Kathryn discovers that various members of the private contractor peace force she joined are a part of this group as are members of the local police.Kathryn takes this news to her supervisor and is asked to pursue the matter. She talks one of two girls into testifying about the abuse and the men who were involved. Called away, her ally in the force takes the girl to testify only to be ambushed and have her taken from him. Returned to the hole she was removed from, the young girl is tortured in front of the rest on hand as a way of showing them what will happen if they talk.Kathryn continues to search for the young girl in hopes of finding her and honoring her promise to keep her safe. Seeing the girl's mother who arrived before she was taken only causes Kathryn more pain. With no one to help her, with all those around her viewing her as the enemy, she finds aid in the group she's worked for at the UN.  Can she save this young girl in time?The end of the story in real life had so so results. The employees of the company involved in the story were removed from the area but not tried in court. An investigation into human trafficking was begun and the depth of the problem was unimaginable. But the costs involved were high. The career of Kathryn Bolkovac was ruined. The problem though slowed remains.The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't pull punches. It wants you, the viewer, to realize just how bad the situation is. It wants you to see just how hopeless the lives of these girls become. And it wants you to know that there are people in this world possessed of an evil so overpowering that human life means nothing to them. In a world where we consider the disruption of cable in the middle of a game to be horrific, its hard to imagine a world like that depicted here. But perhaps with movies like this more people will be made aware.Weisz does a tremendous job here pulling out both the naive ness of her character at first and then the realization that she may have taken on more than she could handle. The feeling of being helpless in a foreign land, of not knowing who you can trust, is on full display in her performance and she does it with ease. You will believe she is Kathryn Bolkovac. And you will realize that this problem is not one that will go away easily.","The Whistleblower [2010, Canada] DVD Starring Rachel Weisz & Monica Bellucci"

424310,"This 1934 pre-code film had the makings of a 1930s classic: starring Al Jolson at his most energetic -- his number Vive La France, filmed live rather than synched to a sound track, gives perhaps more vividly than anything on film what he must have been like on stage -- the staff is completed by a panoply of Thirties film yeomen and yeowomen: Kay Francis, Dolores Del Rio, Ricardo Cortez, Dick Powell, and Guy Kibbee; the songs are mostly by Warren and Dubin, the production numbers by Busby Berekely. The story has something to do with Jolson's Paris caberet the Wonder Bar (""Wunderbar"" -- geddit?) as a setting for an interlocking set of frustrated lovers.And yet the whole somehow doesn't gel together. Part of the problem is that the film uneasily combines a light musical with a murder mystery, giving the effect of two movies intercut with each other. And the running stock jokes and routines, obviously recycled from the vaudeville tradition, almost give the impression of a third film, a burlesque, thrown randomly into the pot. The Berkeley production numbers, while interesting, aren't as spectacular as in his masterpieces 42nd Street or Gold Diggers of 1933, Powell looks such a callow youth that he verges on parodizing his male ingenue persona, and Del Rio's habit of expressing every emotion by looking wistfully into the distance, even if she is in a small dressing room where there is no distance to look into, gets tedious after the eighth time she does it. A high point, though, is Jolson (who was born in Lithuania when it was part of Czarist Russia) singing a soulful rendition of Ochi Tchornya (Dark Eyes) in Russian.The film's reputation for shock value -- some have suggested it was one of the reasons the Motion Picture Code was implemented shortly after -- will generally seem overstated today: there are frequent double entendres, some specific references to adultery and homesexuality, a murderess who gets away with it, and an outrageous Gaucho whip dance which seems too campy for anyone to get very upset about.The really shocking sequence today, though, as anyone who has read other reviews will know, is the extended blackface production number ""Going to Heaven on a Mule,"" which wanders through about every racial stereotype about African-Americans you can think of. I suppose it has a social value as a startling reminder of just how acceptable such racism was in America until relatively recent times.It's hard to know what rating to give this movie. As entertainment, parts of it are a lot of fun to watch, and though fairly tame by present standards, it serves as an example of what pushing the envelope was like in 1934. The 1930s women's fashions are luscious. I'd say those heavily into Thirties films, Al Jolson, Busby Berkeley, or the social history of popular cinema will find it worth watching, if they can steel themselves to sit through ""Mule."" Others probably will want to pass.I saw it on the Warner's Archive DVD, which seemed a satisfactory transfer of a not too bad print.",Wonder Bar VHS

1037613,"I have mixed reviews about shortbus.  I heard about it here on amazon because of all the rave reviews and the appeal of the sexuality. In retrospect, I am confused on all the perfect reviews of this movie.  Beware! There are spoilers!From the beginning scene to the end, I was definitely enthralled and did not look away.  I am not used to seeing sex on film so raw, so real, so gay (sorry but I've never seen a gay porn) yet not be a porn movie.  For the most part, I thought the actors and actresses did a remarkable job.  How brave they all must be to bare all in a non-porn setting!  And I certainly admire the vision, or at least my interpretation of the vision, which is to show sex and relationships in a way Hollywood will never grant us--lifelike.  I like that it tries to demolish the uptight American view of sexuality and catch us up with the rest of the world (Europe, anyway.)  And I like that this movie was seemingly made for women and gay men; although I'm straight I liked the openness and relaxed nature that Hollywood would never portray to this audience.  The actors and actresses were very beautiful but in a realistic way; the female form never looked so good and was paired with men and women alike, without the unbelievable airbrushing and body doubles in movies today.  And it was kind of nice that the penis was not the forbidden genital like in all our movies outside of porn.  But there many things I did not particularly like- at times the story and the acting were lacking.The story I liked at times but overall it felt shallow and poorly thought out.  And some things did not make a lick of sense.  A sex therapist that is pre-orgasmic and blows up at her clients, physically assaulting them?  And after, following them to a sex club without her love being aware?  What sense did it make that Jennifer (sorry severin) formed a bond with our troubled sex therapist by taking a polaroid of an unbelievable dialogue between Sofia and a group of strangers?  I guess the therapist had no awareness that her view on sex and her sex life was sad, pathetic, and misguided.Rob seemed to be pretty damn carefree regarding Sofia's actions throughout the whole movie.  I don't know if this was poor writing or acting.  I also like how Sofia never consulted her true love one time before kissing or touching strangers.  Nor did most of the characters for that matter, save James and Jamie, and their ease of bringing a stranger into the relationship was totally unbelievable.And the vibrator scene?  Completely ridiculous.  In this scene both Sofia and Rob failed miserably in selling this to the audience.And the worst part of this movie by far was the stalker.  Wow.  Anything to do with that poorly written and performed character was completely unbelievable and laughable.  He works from home and has been watching and following everyone for years without anyone noticing.  Right.  I don't care if you're gay or straight or what- you would call the cops in a second and be furious if you found that you had a stalker.  Why did Jamie have sex with him at the end of the movie? And why did his frantically worried partner smile at him across the alleyway?  Don't you think James would have been a little upset?  Thanks for the call to let me know you're alive Jamie, and I'm glad your sleeping with a creep 20 feet from our place.I'm glad Sofia finally discovered an orgasm; you'd think being a sex therapist and all she'd have the resources or at least be able to seek professional assistance to resolve this before now.The ending... How disappointed I was to see everything wrapped up in a neat little happy package at the end of the movie just like all our Hollywood mainstream movies.I know this review is harsh especially in comparison to the others, and I know that alot of hard work was put into this, but overall it was just ok and it certainly doesn't deserve all the perfect ratings.",Shortbus
1611940,"I guess we so-called Generation X'ers like more plot and story than just pure action, unlike our Millenial counterparts. This film seems more targeted to the action crowd than the audience who wants to see an intricate plot and a compelling storyline. While there are a few good things in this film, such as Branagh as the baddie and an interesting seduction scene between him and Keira Knightley as Jack Ryan's heartthrob, the film never quite pulled me in. At one point, the plot takes a pretty good turn where the baddie seemed to have the upper hand but that was all too brief. Thereafter, I guessed where the film was going.The plot is rather complex but underdeveloped, which is part of the problem with this latest installment in the Jack Ryan Canon. The story begins with Ryan (now played by Chris Pine, the most recent Captain Kirk in the latest Star Trek films) during his salad days as an economics PhD student at a university in London during the 9/11 attacks. After serving his country and being injured for his troubles, he is then recruited by the CIA via Thomas Harper, played by Kevin Costner. Ryan is to pretend he's a typical trader on Wall Street, but in secret he's investigating off-shore investments which might be funding terrorists group. Through an analysis that takes only minutes on-screen, Ryan discovers trillions of dollars in secret accounts which he traces to some kind of business magnate, Viktor Cherevin, played with nice understatement by Kenneth Branagh.Unfortunately, for my taste, we really don't see how Ryan was able to penetrate the accounts so fast. He just flips on his laptop and finds a whole bunch of inaccessible accounts and immediately knows what they are. I really wanted to have a much more developed sequence where he looks for clues and follows leads. After about 5 minutes of screen time, he's flying to Moscow to confront Branaugh. At the same time, he is living with the woman who was helping him in the hospital. However, she doesn't know he's secretly working for the CIA. And then Costner ends up in Moscow to help Ryan, and then lo and behold, the girlfriend ends up there too and the race is on with lots of car chases through Moscow and then in New York.Overall, a modestly entertaining but for some reason not entirely satisfying action film. At no point in the story does the baddie ever get his way or achieve any of his goals, except for one action sequence about 75% of the way into the film that is way too short. And I liked Branaugh as the vain and soft-spoken baddie, the way he should be. At a certain moment, one of the people in his organization scolds him because of his weakness for booze and broads, which was one of my two favorite scenes in the film but like most of &#34;Shadow Recruit&#34;, the good scenes were all too brief. There is also a young baddie of Russian extraction now living in America as a double-agent, but very little about him is developed except a biography which is recapped for about 30 seconds. The script needed about 2-3 more rewrites before it would have been there. Essentially about 80% action and only 20% story development. I wanted more interesting scenes, not just piles and piles of car chases. A one-watch at best.",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit
708016,"After hearing how bad Queen of the Damned was, I was somewhat surprised by how I enjoyed this film overall. It isn't in the same ballpark as the great Interview with a Vampire, but on its own it is worth it to watch.Among the problems it has is the lack of character development for all the main characters, including, to a lesser extent, Lestat. As that vampire re-awakens to become a rock star, we never get a real good sense of who he is, and why he's &quot;coming out of the coffin&quot; and revealing himself as a vampire to the world, a big no-no. But he's got more characterization than the queen of the damned herself, as well as his sort-of love interest, who wants to become a vampire.The pacing of the film also is off, I'm assuming because the plot is taken from a number of Anne Rice novels, not any one in particular. Though I never read them, I could feel the schizophrenia in the film and it made me wish they would have narrowed the plot down to one book.But despite these major flaws, there is still a good deal to appreciate. The world it takes place has the right, spooky atmosphere a good vampire film is supposed to possess, much of the cinematography is visually exciting, and the queen herself, when the rage takes her, is quite an exciting sight.Overall, this film has as many weakness as it does strengths, and it's unfortunate it's not better. But it's not as bad as many critics make it out to be. Worth at least one viewing, especially if you love vampires.",N/A
1178187,"This is a well-recorded and performed production of the Nutcracker. However, a word of warning needs to be put for those expecting a 'traditional' production. This is a new staging and interpretation dating from 2001, with a completely different conceptual emphasis for many of the characters and their roles. The costuming and staging is bright and effective and works well in this production. The music is played in a refreshingly fleet manner and this accompanies effective steps in a modern way that I find a little ungainly at times but understandable in the circumstances - Clara is an unloved child at a transitional age in this production for example. Unsuspecting loved children expecting a kind artistic experience might find this rather unsettling although there are many unloved children in real life of course.However there are fine alternatives. There is one for those who would prefer the 'traditional' Peter Wright version familiar to the Royal Ballet followers and which has been filling Covent Garden for years. For those who are familiar with this production there is nothing unexpected about this version and all is danced with the utmost skill within a lavish stage setting. The sound is excellent as is the camera work. This will be the perfect version for huge numbers of people and as such comes with the highest recommendation. It would be a Nutcracker of choice for many people.There are others available which may also appeal. My personal favourite is the Bolshoi Ballet production with choreography by Grigorovich who has a wonderful sense of the epic and knows how to make the most of the large spaces provided by his theatre at the Bolshoi. Anyone who knows the Spartacus ballet for example will be aware of this. There are many breathtakingly beautiful sequences throughout his production - the corps de ballet in the Waltz of the Snowflakes being but one example. The character dances in Act two are refreshingly imaginative while remaining essentially traditional. The Pas de Deux of the Prince and Marie towards the end of Act 3 rises to climatic lifts that do not disappoint emotionally. One could go on and on .......!I also like the San Francisco American setting of the ballet as an alternative version which is largely traditional in flavour and which has a refreshingly different selection of character dances to offer. The Arabian Dance is especially effective in my opinion.Currently we are spoiled for choice, there being well-recorded versions to suit a wide variety of taste as described above. This is one of the least safe in my opinion because of its relatively dark concept, although very fine in its own way. Safer, more 'traditional' options would be the Royal ballet version along with the excellent Bolshoi version. The San Francisco Ballet is also worth considering.For my taste I would choose this as a good alternative and rather dark view. However, I find the San Francisco production kinder and would choose either the new Royal Ballet or the Bolshoi version as my favourite single best buy - essentially traditional, well performed, well recorded and crucially, a kinder experience.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one.

925858,"Watching TRUTH ABOUT LOVE (is this a double entendre about the star?) is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep - you put it in the DVD slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day. And it works for that for that purpose: being a British romantic comedy it is a bit more.The story is a rather simple one about a wife Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt) married to an increasingly distant husband Sam (Jimi Mistry) who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice. His partner Archie (Dougray Scott) is fond of both Sam and Alice, but has a longtime attraction to Alice that goes beyond friendship. Alice pals with her sister Felicity (Kate Miles), a free love advocate, who encourages Alice to have affairs. On Valentine's Day, after a drinking binge with her sister, Alice mails a card to Sam signed 'Anonymous' as a test to see if Sam responds, testing his fidelity. At the same time Archie mails a radish seed packet to Alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not. Both have ex post facto regrets. Sam in fact is spending time with a lover Katya (Branka Katic) and is indeed cheating on Alice. Alice arranges assignations with Sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet Sam in disguise as 'Anonymous' to test his fidelity. The entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth - and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise (of sorts) of the fluffy script.British comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting. Perhaps had director John Hay elected to cast a British actress as Alice instead of pasting a phony accent on Jennifer Love Hewitt the result may have been improved. But in the end this story by Peter Bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages. One terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive. There are some nice scenes of London and a few moments of passable humor, but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music/white noise. Grady Harp, October 05",N/A

1280167,"Just watched the DVD without having seen the Trailers or previous reviews.  Picked up the movie based on the quality of the actors and the description on the DVD case, a ""gripping suspense thriller"".  Based on the DVD case description we thought we were getting a Hitchcockian type suspense thriller.  Hardly!Plot synopsis:  Happily married couple...wife walks out the door and disappears about ten minutes into movie...husband spends remainder of movie tracking down, dealing with, and coming to terms with the emotional trauma created by ""The Other Man"".  Husband knows why wife disappears from the moment we see her leave in a slow motion shot...no mystery to him at all.  Too bad we are left hanging for the next forty-five minutes.  Her apparent disappearence early on has nothing to do with the plot other than to make us think we are watching a suspense thriller.  No guns, no chases, no violent confrontations, no 180 degree plot twists, and no surprise ending.  In fact, the ending is wierd and beguilling.  In our our view it seems tacked on and somewhat implausable.First rate acting and beautiful locale photography of Milan and Lake Como, Italy, make up, somewhat, for a disjointed plot and some odd film editing.  In the scenes following the wife's disappearance we literally stopped the DVD and wondered if it had skipped ahead a chapter by mistake.  Additionally, if we hadn't spent two years living near Milan and Lake Como we'd loose track of the continuous flashbacks and changes in plot locations.  This is a film requiring your full attention to keep up.Still, if we'd wanted to watch a lushly made ""Lifetime TV"" drama which confusingly unfolds revealing a love triangle, we'd rent this movie.

900771,"STRANGE BEDFELLOWS is one of those films that plays like a TV sitcom without the canned laughter - especially now that gay themed shows have made it big on television.  This film's main charm is its Aussie flavor and that forgives a lot of the shortcomings of a fluffy idea of a script.Essentially, two men (Paul Hogan and Michael Caton) decide to avoid back taxes and take advantage of a new law that allows same sex partners to gain the rights of married couples by passing as a gay married couple.  How they go about convincing each other that they can pass as gay in order to convince the authorities and then how they can learn to act gay and live a gay life to back up their story is the action of the movie.  Many stereotypes are included but somehow the Aussies know how to pull this off with minimal offense.The overall theme, after the story is all said and done, is one of tolerance and compassion for people who are in different societal climes.  Hogan and Caton pull this off well, showing how really everyone they meet in their charade is just a 'regular guy' - and for that reason the film becomes more tolerable than the usual farces that deal with 'passing'.

208839,"Well, this was never really my favorite movie. But the quality of much recent media has increased my opinion of &quot;Popeye&quot; quite a bit. Most people can not seem to make a movie these days without giving us all effects and no story, showering us with blood, sex, or profanity, trying to force feed us what is politically correct, or having someone killed every other minute. The fact that &quot;Popeye&quot; does not fall into any of these categories greatly increases my opinion of it. Now it is not the most worthy movie to be sure. HOWEVER, there are many memorable elements. The scenery is simple, but it does carry charm. The songs are cute and memorable. The town's fear of Popeye, and later its acceptance of him is realistic and well done. It is touching how Popeye fights through a difficult journey to find his father, and funny when he gets into different kinds of trouble on the way, and accidentally becomes the town's hero. (When he accidentally pushes the tax man into the water.) Popeye's father is handled well. First we hear of him. (Although we don't know the person everyone is talking about is Popeye's father.) Then we see him, and the resemblance to Popeye makes it obvious that he is Popeye's father; then they meet and discover each other. Popeye's final persuit of Bluto is suspenseful and hilarious. We finally see Popeye and his father together and they get on each other's nerves the whole way. Popeye's father even carries out his role as a father when he pushes Popeye into doing something so he can save the day! So while this is not exactly a smash hit, (in my opinion) it carries many worthy elements; it is worth the time; and while it may not become a classic, it will probably carry a strong cult following. If you have not seen it, do so. You may be pleasantly surprised.",Popeye

876471,"I was looking through my local video store and was excited to find a movie about Stu U ! I read mnay things about him on the internet and his lifestory was so interesting that a film about his life would be very interesting as well. Sadly, this movie didn't come close to revealing the passion that was stu. His grief and anguish in this film was but a small glimpse of a real man with more profound emotions than the character who played him. The movie felt like it was on the peripheral rather than really facing the man, Stu U. In short the character didn't do justice to him nor did the script. Stu was a brilliant man but they never showed his intellect the way he deserved. Rather, they portrayed him as a very good Gin player, which he was, with a foul mouth and bad manners. I believe he wasn't as naive and childish as they made him out to be in the movie. I wish they focused less on his childhood, which comprised a decent portion of the film, and more on his poker games as well as his demons .",High Roller - The Stu Ungar Story

The town believes that she and the dinner are evil temptations and they are wary.This movie is slow and you need to hang in there up to the dinner prep scenes.  The build-up to the dinner scenes seem lightly connected if at all to the main event.  That being said, the dinner prep and the dinner were riveting and a must-see movie experience.

1274597,"The title of The Merry Gentleman, Michael Keaton's directorial debut, comes from the beginning of the film when hitman Keaton helps secretary Kelly MacDonald, who has fallen under a Christmas Tree she is trying to bring into her apartment.  Earlier, MacDonald saw Keaton standing on the ledge of a building across from her office.  Keaton had just made a ""hit"" and was contemplating suicide. It turns out that Keaton is a tailor who kills people on the side and hates himself for it.  Does he show up at MacDonald's door to kill her because she might be able to identify him?  After helping her bring her tree into her apartment, he walks away, only to return the next day to visit her.  Unfortunately, he has pneumonia and falls senseless the ground outside her apartment.  MacDonald finds him, gets him to the hospital, and a beautiful friendship is born -- on Christmas Day, no less.All this described action takes place in the first few minutes of the movie.  The rest of the film explores the relationship of Keaton and MacDonald, and it is well done.  If the film doesn't make much sense, we don't care because we are genuinely interested in what is going to happen to this odd couple.  The police are after Keaton and MacDonald's abusive husband is after her.  Will the police catch Keaton and will MacDonald's husband find her?  We care about the answers to these questions and watch with some interest as the plot plays out.As mentioned in the beginning of this review, this film is Michael Keaton's directorial debut.  He directs his cast, particularly MacDonald, reasonably well, but the story is confusing, particularly his own role as hitman.  All the characters related to the hitman part of the story are given marginal status in the film.  They appear, disappear, and are forgotten.  We have no idea what motivates Keaton and this is a problem.  How are we to understand his behavior towards MacDonald?  He kills people mercilessly, yet he is kind and caring toward MacDonald.I have been careful to avoid mentioning any spoilers in this review.  I recommend the film because the Keaton/MacDonald story is genuinely interesting and well done.  At the very end the viewer can decide what sense it all makes.  I must admit confusion and some slight disappointment.",N/A
874423,"This was the very first pre-recorded video I ever purchased way back in 1979. At that point in time, video stores did not even exist and I had to purchase it through the mail via a long-defunct company called, The Videotape Network. They also sold The Best of Ernie Kovacs and The Beatles Live in Tokyo. At the time I was thrilled to have actual moving images of Lenny Bruce who, due to the nature of his material, was not often in front of the camera - film, television or otherwise. In hindsight the film leaves a little bit to be desired because of the fact that Fred Baker, a good filmmaker, uses alot of unrelated material to illustrate Lenny's  recorded bits - not that he had any other choice. Since then, a far superior film has been made that was shown briefly in  New York City and on HBO about five or six years ago, Lenny Bruce: Swear To Tell The Truth. For some reason that film has yet to be released on DVD or VHS. Untill that happens this film is your best bet. You won't be disappointed.Tom DeganGoshen, NY",Lenny Bruce Without Tears

510150,"THE STENDHAL SYNDROME[La Sindrome di Stendhal](Italy - 1995)Aspect ratio: 1.66:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalQuite unlike anything Dario Argento has directed before, THE STENDHAL SYNDROME is a grimly realistic portrait of a female  police officer (Asia Argento, essentially miscast) whose encounters with a sadistic rapist/serial killer (Thomas Kretschmann) have devastating consequences. Though distinguished by some truly horrific violence, played straight by Argento with few of his trademark stylistic flourishes, the film is much too languid for its own good, wasting a lot of valuable time on an otherwise laudable attempt to depict the long-term consequences of a vicious sexual assault on the central character. Furthermore, the harsh  subject matter allows no room for levity, and the austere scenario is at odds with the sumptuous artwork that acts as a catalyst for the murderous proceedings. Asia's convulsive reactions to works of art (hence the ornate title) makes her a target for Kretschmann's psychopathic killer, allowing Argento to fill the screen with paintings, sculptures and beautiful objet d'art, which offsets the film's own lack of visual flair.But there's a fierce intelligence underpinning the somewhat predictable scenario: When Asia de-emphasizes her femininity in response to the initial attack, only to re-establish her womanhood after a second assault in which she emerges the victor (or does she?), it becomes easier to forgive the painfully obvious surprises which clog up the final quarter. Only one scene recalls the best of Argento's work: A potential victim being stalked through a dimly lit room full of oversized marble statues, a brilliantly edited  sequence which suggests everything and reveals nothing. Overall, ""Stendhal"" may not be vintage Argento, but it's too clever and too unsettling to be easily dismissed, and it gets under the skin like no other horror film in recent memory. See it and make up your own mind.",N/A

855132,"Three taped comedy concerts and one documentary on his life (""Just a Ride"") make for an awful lot of Bill Hicks for the uninitiated.  The concerts are ""One Night Stand,"" ""Revelations,"" and ""Relentless,"" and, when Hick's at his best, they're apt descriptions of his effect.  The targets include the religious right, Republicans, and, by his standards, various and sundry other moral hypocrites.  The style is aggression bordering on passion.  Hicks has his loyal fans - Goat Children - but I was like an agnostic at a revival meeting.  Rather than salvation through laughter I found Hicks more thought provoking that rib tickling.  At least the first time through.The big problem is that there's a lot of repeat material in all three concerts.  Hicks, who died in 1994, recorded all three in the early nineties, and I guess some repetition can be expected and forgiven.  It gets a little leaden when you watch them back to back to back, though.The second problem concerns the documentary.  Unforgivably they tell you when Hicks died but not the cause of death (pancreatic cancer.)  As you've probably read in the product description the documentary includes Brett Butler, Jay Leno, and David Letterman, among others.  The second sin committed by the documentary is allowing David Letterman to express his personal regret about the Hicks's last appearance on his late night show, which was censored, without explaining why or what material was cut. If a `net search is correct it had to do with something Hicks said that offended pro-lifers. In all, a pleasantly amusing three hours, lots of repeats, and not enough to send me shopping for Bill Hicks concert cds anytime soon.","Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian"

787260,"""Out of Time"" is a nice little exercise of the crackerjack plot, an entirely forgettable wrong-guy-accused yarn fit for its day in court some HBO Saturday night. But what is it doing as a big budget thriller? And what is Denzel Washington doing within 100 yards of it?Not that Washington, now with two Oscars, hasn't slummed before - ""Fallen"" and ""John Q"" come to mind - but Dave Collard's script is too thin and Carl Franklin's direction too hurried for the movie to be anything more than a passing thought. And the casting is something else: Washington is forced to play love interest to Sanaa Lathan and Eva Mendes, women 17 and 20 years his junior. Washington has impressive range, but who knew the Ralph Macchio role was part of it?The plot in a quickie: Washington is Matt Whitlock, a newly separated, small-town Florida cop in an affair with his high school sweetheart Anne Marei (Lathan) whose abusive husband (Dean Cain) is a former quarterback out of cash. During one afternoon tryst, Anne Marei takes Matt to the doctor with her, where he learns she has terminal cancer. After some stomach churning, Matt steals a half-million in confiscated drug money to help her pay for the alternative treatment in Switzerland.The night she's to pick it up, she doesn't show. The next morning her house has burned down. And Matt's slated as beneficiary to her life insurance policy. Another complication: Matt's soon-to-be-ex-wife, Alex (Mendes), is the lead homicide detective on the case.""Out of Time"" then shifts into a game of Matt eliminating clues that point to his guilt, tracking the source of the setup - a shiny nickel if you can guess that one - and taking an afternoon siesta to reminisce with Alex. Franklin zips through the material in an attempt to gloss over a criminal plan that not only doesn't hold up but never made sense in the first place.In what is essentially an asexual role, Washington generates no heat with Mendes or Lathan. Mendes is naturally likable and good-looking in a Jennifer Lopez kind of way, but Alex and Matt's marriage is built on moviesphere, nothing more.Beyond that, when it is ever good to take the smartest guy in the picture and figure him for a mark? If that actor is, say, Nicolas Cage, who can play loose and goose, that one's thing. But Washington sweats smarts, and while ""Out of Time"" shows Matt as light on his feet, it first must establish him as a dope - and a heel.",Out Of Time

949552,"Be prepared to pay for your sins when you enter THE CONFESSIONAL! Cult British Horror director Pete Walker uses the film to take a penetrating look into religion, particularly in the archaic practices of the Catholic church. Father Xavier Meldrum uses his confessional booth to spy on his parish, using the tapes he collects to blackmail the members of his church and coerce them into doing whatever he likes. Young Jenny becomes the object of his obsession, and when blackmail fails to bring them together, he tries the next best thing: murder! The priest claims to be cleansing his flock by forcing their sins out into the open, where he threatens to expose their adultery, premarital sex, and abortions to their friends and families. The more modern Father Cutler frequently tries to convince Meldrum of the church's outdated practices, but Meldrum is locked in his ways, and accuses Cutler of allowing their members to fall into temptation. These impacted questions of morality are as relevant today as they were in 1976 upon the film's release, allowing THE CONFESSIONAL an added significance and deeper meaning than the average exploitative shocker of its kind. Walker's key lighting creates an ominous mood in the church setting, where a great number of the unexpectedly brutal and bloody murders take place. Although its pace often suffers, the performances by Anthony Sharp, Stephanie Beacham, Norman Eshley, and the great Sheila Keith hold the audience's attention throughout the slower exposition. This is one of Walker's better films, falling somewhere between HOUSE OF WHIPCORD and FRIGHTMARE in quality and style.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",The Confessional: House of Mortal Sin
1640998,"And those who can't teach, teach gym.  That's from Woody Allen, and maybe it's too bad that he didn't direct this movie.  It's a send-up of Middle-American morality, but it never succeeds in becoming anything more than a pleasant little film.I invoked the overused cliche for my review title because that's the well from which this little drama springs.  It is the thwarted desires of the English teacher (Julianne Moore) and the drama teacher (Nathan Lane) which drive them to produce the corny, but mildly promising script by the former student (and spoiled brat) played by Michael Angarano.  The play in question is called ""The Chrysalis"", which in itself is kind of a corny metaphor for high school.... the place which is supposed to incubate successes (and largely produces failures.)  Michael Angarano's ""Jason"" appeals to the deeply ingrained sense of inferiority in his former teachers... and at one point, he honestly reveals his contempt for them, to Moore's character.  By that point, Moore's English teacher is experiencing an unrelenting fall from grace largely because of Jason's manipulations.Moore and Lane are basically what makes this film watchable, and Moore in particular.  She is excellent in her comedic portrayal of a repressed (but still attractive) middle-aged woman who is a victim of her own politically correct nature.  In fact Moore is so good, she will probably remind you of at least one person that you know.This movie reminded me of both ""Waiting For Guffman"" and ""Election"" in its close to the bone portrayals of small town personalities, and high school viciousness.  But it never rises to the level of ""Guffman"", which is absolutely hilarious.

1461964,"13(released Oct/11)stars Sam Riley as Vincent ""Vince"" Ferro,Mickey Rourke as Patrick Jefferson,Ray Winstone as Ronald Lynn Bagges,Jason Statham Jaspar Bagges and a surprise appearance from veteran actor Ben Gazarra,as one of the bettors.13 is one heck of a disturbing film that has its own tempo,and if you happen to get left behind,too bad.One must make alot of assumptions and put the pieces together as it goes.In other words,it makes you think on the fly.Sometimes a good thing,here not so good.The story finds Riley as an electrician/renovator.He has a relative in the hospital for whom he must remortgage the house in order to pay his bills.One day on his job he overhears the house owner talking about the receiving of an envelope that will make him alot of money.The man suddenly dies and Riley grabs the envelope.Outside the authorities are monitoring the envelope's delivery and the person that will use it.Riley gets home and opens it to find detailed instructions and a phone number.He follows them to a tee and gets picked up and taken to a remote house in the woods far away from New York City.It is there he finds out what it is that he has to do to earn the money.He has become the unwilling participant in a sick and deadly game of 13 man Russian Roulette.They stand in a circle,each with a gun pointed to the head of the one in front of them.They are told to cock their gun hammers,then wait for a round bulb with the mark of a spider on it,to come on.Then they simply shoot and see who drops dead.There are three initial rounds,with each man receiving one bullet on the first,two on the second and three on the third.The men come from varying backgrounds,some brought there against their free will and others willing participants.The survivors move on to the finale.Statham has put his brother,who has been in and out of a psych hospital,in this sick game for three times running and who is the standing champ.He has made alot of money off of his brother.Riley on the other hand had no idea what it was all about and is at first extremely nervous and distraught.As the game progresses he becomes resigned to his fate and Statham's brother's taunts just steel his resolve to get through it.As it would happen,Riley and Winstone make it to the finale.Both men are given the necessary three bullets each,and stand facing each other and at the ready to shoot.When the bulb comes on,there are two empty clicks heard and both men stand.It then goes on to the next round and four bullets are given each man.When the bulb goes on Winstone lays dead on the floor and underdog Riley is the survivor.He is given $1,850,000 for his troubles.When those who bet heavily on him to win offer him a lift to the train station,he realizes they want his money.Riley sneaks away and gets to a train station.While at the station the authorities move in on him.He temporarily ditches his money and is taken in for questioning.Riley plays dumb and is eventually let go.He gets his money,mails it home and hops aboard the train.Statham has lost not only his brother but millions of dollars and finds Riley and stalks him aboard the train.When the time is right Statham shoots Riley in the stomach several times and flees with the money bag(filled with just clothes and a stuffed animal).Before Riley dies he swallows his postal receipt so no one will know about the money.The film closing has Statham fleeing through a deserted pedestrian tunnel.The film gets to its point in a quick enough fashion but its set up can leave one with alot of questions,questions which the film will not stop to answer and hopes either you pick up later on or somehow figure out on your own.There is no explanation at all to Rourke's character,just that he is some tough hombre' that was stewing in a Mexican jail for...who knows why? For some reason they gave Stathams brother's character(Winstone) some filling out as we are first introduced to him as just another participant.Then there's a flashback as to where he came from and how he got there,and it shows the tension between the two brothers.And that ending of Statham steeling away with what he thinks is Riley's winnings,leaves one scratching ones head.Statham disappears through the other end of the tunnel and the camera just hangs there watching for about 10 seconds.....then it suddenly fades to black.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.There is a featurette and interviews.But for the most part,what is in the interviews is in the featurette!Kind of a waste of space,if you ask me.All in all an uneven film with its premise,of men being either willing or unwilling participants in a human ring of Russian roulette,being a very disturbing one indeed.The film makes no apologies for it and as a viewer I can accept it.I think my criticism here lies in just HOW the story was told and executed,one might say.",13
118152,"I purchased this film because of the rave notices it received here and because I've never seen it before.  Unfortunately, I was more than a little disappointed that, from my point of view, it turned out to be just adequate.  I've seen far better war movies that I've obviously kept due to their value as films I can watch multiple times without tiring of them.  The only thing I found of interest in this film was the terrific job by several actors that later went on to play iconic TV characters (most notably, George Tobias/Abner Kravitz on Bewitched & Hugh Beaumont as the Beaver's dad), plus the always dependable Henry Hull.  And of course, that harrowing nighttime battle towards the end (of an 142 minute movie!) was worth the viewing.  Other than that, most of the film involves a long hike through muck and mire (a joke used in the film by George Tobias).  It was interesting to note that the film was initially banned in the United Kingdom due to grandstanding by the Americans, who apparently had little to do with this particular campaign but were more than willing to take all the credit for it (at least on film).  Considering this movie was made during a time of war and was obviously used as a means of recruiting, that charge might be excused.I am not sorry I got the chance to see it at least once, but I don't ever want to watch it again.",N/A
367629,"All of my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film's transfer from Standard Def DVD  to the higher standard set for Blu Ray. Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant.  The film's historical accuracy has been subject to debate, but then so was the accuracy of the much superior film 'Tombstone' with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer.Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.VIDEO QUALITY.....The video for the 192 minute version of Wyatt Earp on Blu Ray (this is not the extended version I have been told is available on the Standard Def DVD) is one of the more uneven Blu Rays I have ever seen in terms of imaging quality.  Most of the day time scenes have fairly decent and natural color grading and contrast and yet other day scenes display a smoothing of details and various degrees of deep blacks. Some scenes show blacks that are impressive but most of the time the blacks often take upon a grayish color grading.  Night time scenes have an unnatural, overly cool blue color grading with a significant loss of detail where there needn't be.  It is somewhat unusual to see such unevenness and lack of consistency in a Blu Ray's imaging.  I noticed no dropouts or disturbing artifacts for this disc but it was quite clear to me that there was no remastering for Blu Ray either; it was simply re-encoded to Blu Ray with an Mbps average rate in the high teens.  While the video is very watchable, its variability in blacks, details and skin tones was completely noticeable.AUDIO QUALITY....A Blu Ray DVD with a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is almost unheard of for Blu Rays.  The only other one that comes to mind is'Goodfellas' and, for both, it is criminal.  You are paying for the highest quality and not getting it.  While the lossy audio codec being used is perfectly listenable, we would have gotten much more for our home theaters systems with a lossless audio codec.  That said, the dialogue was easy to discern with volume levels quite consistent.  During the first 70 minutes of the film the front audio stage, while mostly steered through the center channel, still had some nice panning and foley fx to the right and left surrounds as well as some discreet foley fx that were nicely separated.  The rear surrounds and LFE channel were not used at all that I could hear.  Actually it almost made me jump when, finally, a foley came through the rears almost half way through the film.  During the second half of the movie there were a few more uses of the rear surrounds and a lightning storm woke up the sub channel producing good but not very deep bottom end.  The music score provided a wide stereo image across the front audio stage but, to my mind, sometimes overshadowed and stepped upon what should have been discreet foley audio fx.EXTRAS.....There were a great many deleted scenes that probably were included in the extended version.  In addition to the typical movie trailer, there was also a documentary 'Making of' that I didn't particularly find very interesting. I have read a great deal about the Earp family and the history behind the Earp legend and a historical featurette on this would have been welcome.To be honest, I am glad I only paid $7.99 for this Blu Ray as it clearly was not properly prepared for its blu ray transfer.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.Thanks for reading.",Wyatt Earp VHS

59998,"Directed by John Woo, Hard Target (1993) was the acclaimed Hong Kong director's first film for an American studio.  Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (Timecop), the film features some of Woo's trademark techniques for action and violence, involving fights, shootouts, pyrotechnics, and vehicular stunts.  While the story itself is pure fantasy, Hard Target is a rather entertaining comic book adventure that features a high level of violence, presented straightforwardly without a high degree of humor.Set in New Orleans, the story revolves around a mysterious group led by Emil Fouchon (Lance Hendrickson), that arranges for wealthy clients to hunt humans like prey.  The victims are usually down on their luck, ex-military vets, who are promised a large sum of money if they survive the deadly game.  Coming from the success of Universal Soldier (1992), Van Damme was entering his prime.  As Chance Boudreaux, he comes to the aid of Natasha `Nat' Binder (Yancy Butler) whose missing father is a losing player in Fouchon's game.  As the pair look into the disappearance of the woman's father, they soon learn his fate.  Things start to unravel, and the body count starts to climb, as Boudreaux finds himself the target of Fouchon's motley group of recreational killers.Fouchon is menacing and talks tough, but does not have the fighting skills or stones, to back it up.  Number two heavy, Pick Van Cleef (Arnold Vosloo), is pretty mean and evil, in a two dimensional way, and certainly looks the part, but his exit from the film is rather lame.  Yancy Butler (Witchblade) does a good job at looking scared, shocked, and surprised.  What scant intentional humor there is, comes from Wilford Brimley, who plays Boudreaux's Uncle Douvee.  With a heavily overdone Cajun accent, Mr. Oatmeal takes on armed baddies with his bow and arrow.The premise that manhunts could take place in the middle of New Orleans is pretty absurd, but with some nicely done action sequences, Hard Target is worth a look just to view John Woo's pyrotechnic style.  Woo apparently wanted some script changes before he would agree to direct, and then when Van Damme was cast, the level of action was amped up.  The strong supporting cast allows the focus to widen from just being about Van Damme.  From here, Woo would put things together, in films like Broken Arrow (1996), and Face/Off (1997).",Hard Target

1545768,"Anchorman 2 had some good laughs but the entertainment isn't evenly spaced throughout the movie. Ron Burgundy is back as an anchorman starting with the Global News Network (GNN). I felt the middle of the movie reached a peak and slacked off toward the end. It did feature plenty of cameos from Harrison Ford, Jim Carrey, Will Smith, Kirsten Dunst, Vince Vaughn, Sacha Baron Cohen and others. It's not quite as funny as the original (which was released in 2004) but offers plenty of amusing scenarios throughout. One of my favorite scenes involved Ron hooking up for interracial sex with his spicy female boss and meeting her family. As with any Will Ferrell movie the humor may not be to everyone's taste since you can't take anything in this movie seriously nor does it expect much from the audience.

981334,"I wasn't quite sure what to entirely make of this film. It's undeniable that Sarah Silverman has a very witty, and unrestrained sense of comedy, which I like, but this film could have been outstanding... something was missing. Most of the songs and skits were funny, but some of them were also indulgent, and in my opinion, didn't go anywhere (though, I hadn't laughed that hard in anything in a while when she portrayed a Jewish porn star). I should probably watch it again... I probably would anyway, because most of it was pretty hilarious, but I can't pinpoint exactly what this film was missing. It could have been that I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. Is this a stand up comedy act? Is this a series of skits? Is this a documentary? It ended up being a montage of all 3 of them, which was kind of odd, considering that not many films I have seen really do that. Basically, I think it was my lack of expectations for this movie that rubbed off on me kind of the wrong way. It didn't blow me away, but I got a pretty good amount of laughs and chuckles from viewing this movie. I would recommend this film for anyone who likes her brand of comedy.",Sarah Silverman - Jesus is Magic
1001777,"Silent Hill, Sony Picture's adaptation of the popular videogame series, continues the entertainment industry's introspective exploration of disaffected and disempowered children, masquerading as dispossessed spirits, desperate to redress insidious abuses, sometimes at the expense of a parent's life.The film opens with Rose Da Silva's (Radha Mitchell) gambit to take her daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the enigmatically titled West Virginia town, against the wishes of her husband, Christopher (Sean Bean), in the hope of finding a spiritual cure for Sharon's mysterious illness. Its onslaught has conjured ominous bouts of sleepwalking, delirious repetition of ''Silent Hill,'' disconcerting memory lapses, and brutal artwork, all threatening to have Sharon institutionalized.En route, Rose and Sharon hazard upon an instinctively suspicious police officer, Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden).  Keen on following the pair into Silent Hill, after a brief encounter in nearby Brahams, the parties are caught off guard by the apparition of a young girl that figures prominently in their separate roadside accidents. Rose ''awakens'' to find Sharon missing. Flustered, she ventures into Silent Hill, on foot, where she believes she has glimpsed her. What she encounters there defies rational explanation. After reuniting with an infuriated Cybil, they navigate a labyrinth of streets and buildings in a dimensionally fractured environment that is enshrouded by powerful metaphysical themes, worthy of some of the best-canvassed creations of the late surrealist, Salvador Dali. Quarantined thirty years ago by Toluca County officials, Silent Hill still smolders as a noxious, ashen hell made more menacing by the shadowy din that periodically transfigures it, heralded by a bellowing siren atop the town's Church. The original coal fire destroyed countless lives-some less innocent than others-and its victims seem to confront Rose and Cybil as badly burnt children, disfigured nurses, contorted corpses, rodent-like insects, and mythical demons--including ""Pyramid Head""--a favorite of the videogamers. Most disturbing perhaps, is Silent Hill's cult of fanatical executioners, bloodthirsty witch hunters, led by beguiling Christabella/Valtiel (Alice Krige, in a role that exceeds the menace of her alter persona as Star Trek's Borg Queen).  More said would spoil the film. Notwithstanding, director Christophe Gans, and writers Nicolas Boukhrief and Robert Avery, execute a superbly crafted, and beautifully cinematographed, film with a brilliant flashback that satisfies nearly all questions about the unfolding mystery.Admittedly, I have never played the Silent Hill videogames. Despite witnessing grown adults shudder at its mention, I suspect the filmmakers' desire to gratify the gaming faithful with violent, if not familiar, imagery did the film more harm than good. The excellent ghost story and score that anchors Silent Hill deserves intellectual play in the disquieted minds of its filmgoers, not in excessively sadistic screen graphics. Gamers will likely disagree with this analysis, and it certainly is not my intention to begrudge them of their joy, but the film's over-reliance on visual mayhem eclipses the truly fine performances of the actors, and truncates constructive narrative and back-story that could have advanced the film's intriguing esoteric, social, psychological, and religious themes. The ""monsters"" and avatars that the protagonists defeat or heed in Silent Hill are metaphors for the less savory in society who impose, or taunt us through, corrosive cultural constraints, institutional obstacles, and personal dilemmas that can corrupt our sense of right and wrong, dissolve the lines between good and evil, and fail our better judgment. Those who are most malevolent threaten the collective good, which has taken the form of a lost and abused little girl in Silent Hill. Falsely accused of the ""sins"" of her mothers, she is to be sacrificed on the altar of heresy. The real fear in the film is the doubt we have in the protagonists' ability to save her, and keep other loved ones safe and alive, away from the fiery precipice.Inspired performances abound. Rahda Mitchell, as the emotionally distraught mother of a terminally ill child, connects with her on screen daughter and husband, and viewers alike. Sean Bean's frustration as an alienated husband, perniciously thwarted by a disingenuous detective, Thomas Gucci--whom actor, Kim Coates, seasons to perfection with small town mindedness--is genuinely believable. Laurie Holden indelibly impresses us as an abrasive, tough motorcycle officer, and Jodelle Ferland, like so many gifted child actors and actresses who have been featured, recently, in sinister tales of possession, raises the bar a notch with a truly mesmerizing interpretation that belies her beauty and innocence.",N/A
1104204,"On a lovely day in Hampstead Heath, seven couples explore their relationships, find love, break up, and come to a crossroads. Most of the seven stories are not intertwined, except for a few parting glances here or there, and one man who is desperately looking to couple up with a woman for the day.The good: I loved the story between Pete and Sara, who I thought were a lovely as husband and wife, and then realized that they were there to share the joint custody of their child, each clutching their divorce papers in hand. It appears that they still love each other, but something is not...right.I also enjoyed the scenes between Brian and Billy (played by Ewan McGregor) a couple who are grappling with the decision to adopt a child, when Billy is having a hard time growing up.Ludo and Esther also gave good performances. If I hadn't read the blurb on the back of the DVD cover, I would have thought that this duo had been together for years and very happy, but this one had a little shock and surprise at the end.The bad: Eddie and Iris's story had captured me at first. Two old friends meeting 40-50 years later, on the same bench they frequented when they were 17, as they were once in love. Something lost me in the middle when it could have been very romantic.Molly and Jamie were featured in the first story, a happily married unit, whose relaxing day is ruined when Jamie spends a little too much time staring a French girl, whose underwear is showing. He then makes up this convoluted story about how he once read the same book she's reading and tells his wife what it's about, etc. She then sees through the falsehood, then goes to the French girl to catch her husband in a lie. I guess it could have been a good story, but something felt a little too contrived about it.The story with Julia and Gerry starts out well as a couple on a clumsy and awkward blind date. As they misunderstand each other less, and start to like each other more, one silly glance at someone else, sends the other into a flurry. It just didn't seem finished and it was a little too abrupt.The strange: Anna and Noel meet after she's had a fight with her boyfriend, and they break up. What occurs then is a back and forth conversation about what is going to happen next. One of them seems crazy, and the other desperate.As in many movies or books that have several different stories with many characters, you can't always expect to connect with all of them. Unfortunately, the number that I connected with was smaller than those that I did. This would be a good film to watch if you do not need a lot of action, but want to be reminded of the interconnectedness of people, and view all of their idiosyncracies. Also, you can never go wrong with London.",N/A

1176860,"The DEVIL'S CHAIR presents an amalgam of Horror themes that are quite familiar to the seasoned viewer. For example, the mix consists of elements and visuals borrowed from: the HELLRAISER series, ALIEN, SESSION 9, HIGH TENSION and the SAW franchise. Admittedly, the blend is deftly arranged and done so as not to give too much away and spoil the ending. Despite having been produced on a modest budget, DEVIL'S CHAIR has a look and feel that is light years beyond what it cost to produce. It is well filmed and acted, though I never entirely warmed to the main character, (though I suspect that this observation is more subjective in nature). Perhaps had the character of Nick WEST been portrayed as a more vulnerable and sensitive individual, he may have evoked increased pathos. In that event it would certainly have played more with the viewer's mind. Instead, I found this character to be in the Bruce WILLIS vein. Perhaps that is what the film maker wished for, though it did not work as well as it could have, in my opinion. I would develop this theme more, however, I wish not to spoil the film for the uninitiated. DEVIL'S CHAIR should appeal to those who prefer psychological Horror, even though they are not afraid to venture down gore alley. Yes, there is gore here and it is reasonably well done, (though the Director held back in some scenes). There is also a creature, (pay no attention to the lousy keep-case artwork). I was disappointed that the film revealed too much in the way of graphics at the outset as they let the ""cat out of the bag"", to some degree. Also, the use of the so-called fourth wall, where the actor provides a monologue to the audience, was a device used with annoying frequency. As the film was well crafted, one did not need these snippets of dialogue which were thrust at the viewer without warning. All they served to do was spoil the visual & auditory flow of the film. Further, that Director Adam MASON also brought us that highly questionable movie, BROKEN. Nonetheless, the DEVIL'S CHAIR represents a vast improvement and the former may represent a blip in the Director's creative output. Albeit somewhat ""artsy-fartsy"", I feel that the DEVIL'S CHAIR is recommended viewing.",The Devil's Chair

In other places it goes ahead and takes the tangent and doesn't achieve anything by including the tangent.

1198100,"I've seen the theatrical version of this film twice.  Once when it was in first run, and again now on Blu-ray.  To be blunt, I thought the film was ok when it was in first run, but wasn't impressed enough with it to want to see it again.  It was and is ok in my book, but I felt it lacked somewhat, at least when compared to my memories of the original TV series.Ah, the TV series.  Total camp, but fun at the same time.  Loved by enough viewers that I can see why it would seem to be a target to mine on the bigger screen, especially with someone like Steve Carell in the lead. Carell makes a good Maxwell Smart, and if the story were better, I think this one could have been a genuine 5 star hit.  Unfortunately, as others have said here, it missed it by that much :-(Anne Hathaway is ok in taking over the Barbara Feldon role, and Alan Arkin isn't bad as the chief.  Honestly none of the performances are disappointing to me, it's just that the story itself, at least from the theatrical version isn't as funny as it should be.Which brings me back to the 62% more laughs that are promised in the Blu-ray.  Ah, more laughs from promised bonus scenes actually sounds good and enticed me to give the Blu-ray a try, but ... the presentation is just so disappointing to me that I have got to slam it in this review.Offering up a director's cut or extended cut version of a film is something that I greatly appreciate, but if you are going to do it, by all that is right in the universe please do it in a way that respects the viewer and not as done here.Seamless branching has been around in the DVD format for a while and it's used here, but isn't even close to being seamless.  Far from it, it seems that if you turn on the bonus scene viewing version of the film you get a neat little icon of Maxwell Smart in the phone booth (or at least of the phone booth) to indicate that bonus materials are now being shown.  That's not bad but... the icon is much larger than it needs to be and obliterates part of the screen when it needn't have been so intrustive.  Even looking past that there's a greater annoyance -- when the bonus scenes are accessed there's an annoying pause present, at least when played on my PS3.  Just enough of a pause that you'll find yourself highly annoyed and will probably want to turn off the bonus scene feature asap.Sadly, from a cursory glance at the menus, there doesn't seem to be a way to just play the bonus scenes.  Instead you must access them in place.  I could be missing something obvious there, but then again, if it was obvious I don't think I would have missed it.So, to summarize, there's a disappointing story (at least in the theatrical version) that doesn't get the best from the talent on hand, and an even more disappointing presentation of the bonus scenes that make the experience less satisfying than it should be.  Missed it by that much indeed.",Get Smart
1232114,"Season 1 of DYNASTY was intelligent and great, even if it was a little slowly-paced and not quite as splashy as fans would come to expect.Season 2 got the balance right: DYNASTY is still a legit character drama, but the glamour and pace have been amped up and rivals Krystle and Alexis would never seem more competent or as in tune as they do here... Easily, this is the defining year of the show --- it looks as if DYNASTY is perched to become the best TV series ever!Season 3: the writing starts to go awry... things don't make sense, non-sequiturs abound, the plotting becomes an afterthought, and too much dialogue is given over to empty sentiments of love/hate and the characters telling each other how fabulous they are. Also, the misguided new static acting directive from the producers damages the performances, unnecessarily ruining the feel of many scenes.Season 4: the 1983/84 year is cited as the peak season for the wealth-based nighttimes soaps of the '80s, and while DYNASTY's riding high in some ways, the goofy, stilted problems from the previous season continue... The very first episode of the year is really quite taut and focused, but it's all downhill from there: Joseph commits suicide after trying to kill Alexis, but the show never fully explains why he set fire to Steven's cabin with her inside it. We know it has something to do with Alexis holding secrets about Kirby's mother --- but what? She was crazy, we already know that... No matter. After Kirby makes a lame attempt at strangling Alexis, the butler's orphaned daughter agrees to marry her rapist, Adam... Then the show initiates a promising plotline about someone stalking Alexis and ransacking her penthouse suite, yet that plot is dropped and forgotten without explanation... Who was doing it??... Claudia weds Steven so Blake can't take away his child in court, then the couple promptly forgets it was a marriage of convenience...  Fallon gets taken in by a slimy slice of Eurotrash, Peter DeVilbis, inexplicably cast with the corpse-like Helmut Berger whose lines appear to be dubbed or shoulda been. When she realizes she's been had by this nasally mumbling opportunist, she runs into traffic and gets one of those Carrington Family Headaches the show seems so fond of; in fact, the headaches get so bad, she suddenly realizes she's loved Jeff Colby all along and wants to remarry him for no convincing reason... Blake's public-relations girl, Tracy Kendall, decides the way to get back at Krystle for taking the promotion she's hoped for is to seduce Krystle's husband in the most lazily-staged, pathetically transparent attempts imaginable... Alexis gets a new boyfriend, the effetely macho Dex Dexter, who just waltzes into her office, lays a kiss on her, and they're together forever! Only their relationship will never make any sense until Season 9 (which is a long time to wait, I'm tellin' ya!)... The cast actually goes to film in Denver for the only time in the series' history, but it remains inside the entire time, ignoring the opportunity to obtain any exterior location footage whatsoever... Diahann Carroll shows up at the end of the year to make a now-obligatory Mysterious Entrance, and she never gets anything else to do for the next three years except hand her brother, Blake, the occasional check to ""save my company, dammit!"" as she's apparently now his banker.Nothing goes anywhere. The writers no longer seem to have a story they feel compelled to tell.At least Alexis briefly takes on a sultry, smokey-voiced sense of her own statured coolness for Season 4, causing her to seem like the only person in the Rocky Mountains who might have even a clue as to what they're actually doing --- although her spontaneous Dietrich solo rountine in a cowboy bar to seal some nonsensical oil deal doesn't go far in proving it.Oh, how good this show seemed to be a just couple of years earlier! For it is unrecognizable now. Only the diamonds and cashmere are of acceptable quality.No wonder Paramount is now splitting up each season into two over-priced packages: the show is completely schizophrenic!","Dynasty: Season 4, Vol. 1"

861168,"This is not one of Isabelle Huppert's best movies but she's always interesting to watch and her great performance is the best thing about this movie and quite frankly the only thing that makes it watchable and worth recommending.The film is essentially a road movie in which Sylvia, a prostitute, and Laurence, her estranged 14-year-old daughter, run away from Nice after the latter commits a crime to defend her mother.  They head to find Sylvia's husband and son, which she abandoned three years before and erased from her memory.  Along the way, they meet a friendly fugitive who helps them.The cast is excellent and the scenery is pretty, though there's a heavy-handed use of flower symbolism and U.S. country songs. In short, I recommend it only for Isabelle Huppert's characteristically superb performance (thought be warned that, even though she's great, this is far from her best films).",La Vie Promise

I'm not sure if I am more disappointed in the story because I don't agree with the perspective or because I don't agree with the interpretation of other viewers.  I did laugh at Rie Miyazawa's last scene when she didn't even want free latex gloves.  That was great.  Hopeful.  I certainly enjoyed her scenes.

818120,"A troubled young boy with the memory issues (Ashton Kutcher) is suddenly able to transport himself back into moments from his past, change them for the better and return to the present. The changes he makes affect not only his life but the lives of his close friends. The problem is - he never knows how exactly the changes made in the past would affect the present. The idea of the movie is anything but new - we all read Ray Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder,"" an unforgettable short story about a time-traveler who steps on a prehistoric butterfly and causes the horrible changes in the fate of the whole humanity. We've seen the films Frequency, Groundhog Day, and Memento - Butterfly Effect borrows a lot from them. BE is not as good as they are but it is a compelling and intriguing movie about making choices and taking responsibilities. I recommend watching director's cut with the ending completely different from the theatrical release.

1604858,"For 38 years the original Carrie has remained one of the greatest horror movies ever made, a shining example of not only how to adapt a book into a movie, but also how to make you....Fear, so it was inevitable that a remake would be made.To not compare this film to the original is impossible. Brian De Palma's version is an immersive experience, a psychological assault on the mind, you feel what Carrie White feels. Chloe Grace Moretz is an incredible actress, but her Carrie doesn't quite project her fears and emotions into us like Sissy Spacek's did.In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie, the mother(played by Julianne Moore) nearly lacks the controlling dominance the original had over Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz's Carrie right from the start doesn't hardly fear her mother, but instead shes defiant towards her, hates her, and this is what separates this new Carrie from the original. Brian De Palma's Carrie FEARS and Kimberly Peirce's Carrie HATES.For the most part the majority of the middle of this film plays out almost identically to that of De Palma's, the actors are the only real difference. Some of the new actors are good and some are just terrible, like Judy Greer(Miss Desjardin / the P.E. teacher), she sounds so week and juvenile when shes speaking her lines it's hard to take her seriously as an authority figure.Lets fast forward to the prom scene. In Brian De Palma's Carrie after winning prom queen and king Carrie and Tommy Ross head up to the stage, this scene is gloriously shot in slow motion, eventually the blood gets poured on her and she goes into a state of absolute shock, the only sound that can be heard is the bucket swaying back and forth, then the bucket falls and hits Tommy in the head knocking him unconscious, in her state She takes no notice of whats happened to Tommy as the overwhelming fear that has enveloped her causes her to lose control unleashing her powers on all her school mates. In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie...well lets face it, the prom scene lacks the build up of the original, no slow motion, no sounds of a swaying bucket, how this scene was shot by De Palma is what made the original so fantastic. Kimberly Peirce's Carrie somewhat figures out how to control her powers, unlike De Palma's who's powers mainly activated out of fear. This time when the blood is poured on her head she doesn't go into shock, instead she nearly walks off stage before turning around after Tommy is hit by the bucket. This pushes her emotions over the edge and in a fully aware state of mind she unleashes her powers on her class mates.I personally feel nothing for Kimberly Peirce's version of Carrie, it may have followed the plot of the book a little closer in some areas, but it did it with far less sophistication. It has some unique changes that make it worth a watch, but ultimately it doesn't come close to the brilliance of the original.",Carrie
504869,"*I cannot really ''praise,'' per se, the originality or story of the film ''Virus,'' because, in all honesty, it's not what anyone can rightly call a great film. Sure, it's visually stunning and fun and enjoyable and all that... but it's certainly not ''Terminator'' or ''Aliens.''Even so, I'm somewhat puzzled that so many reviewers are having a difficult time ''relating'' to this movie, based upon how it plays itself out. I think they are missing one key element in the whole thing, however:Just as ADULT reviewers have to be reminded that ''Santa Claus Conquers the Martians'' was a movie made for the tiny tot audience, reviewers of the movie ''Virus'' need to keep in mind that this film was based on a ''comic book'' story (...or as ''fanboys''-- current and former --would call it, a ''graphic novel'')!Anyone who pays any amount of attention would realize that there is NEVER (or rarely ever) going to be a ''totally straight'' presentation of a comic book story translated to the big screen -- even if the story itself is treated ''seriously'' within the pages of the comic. (''The Crow'' was one of those rarest of exceptions.)Keeping that in mind may actually make viewing this movie about an alien energy lifeform that....??? uses human bodies for ''spare parts'' ???...., and tries to kill them off more effectively by constructing cybernetic monstrosities???.... okay, so it's a little ludicrous, but again, I don't think it was meant to be taken completely seriously -- it's mindless escapism that's both fun and scary.

There's just one problem - there's an authoring error that puts a few seconds of one scene in the middle of another.  At about 18 minutes in as Dudley is trying to decide what to do with all of the donation letters he has, the image suddenly switches to a previous scene where Dudley and the professor are looking at the bishop's old church.  The audio continues on as if the other scene isn't there, but the image is wrong.  This lasts for about three seconds, then it returns to the right visuals.

1034482,"Jake Feldman (Meat Loaf) runs a sweat shop specializing in fake furs. His frustration  with his lack of quality furs causes him to lash out at his mostly immigrant staff. What frustrates Jake even more are the unreturned advances of a stripper named Shanna (Ellen Ewusie) whom he is obsessed with. Jake pays her nightly visits and on one particular night things take a  terrifying turn in Jake's life . After he  almost rapes Shanna he gets a phone call from a trapper named Jameson (John Saxon). Jameson and his son have just caught the most beautiful raccoon furs imaginable and he is  offering Jake first pick of the merchandise. Before Jake can meet up with Jameson, Jameson's son, under the mysterious influence of the furs murders his father by bashing his head in with a metal bat and takes his own life by diving headfirst into a bear trap. The gore in this film is ridiculous and  over the top but still disgusting. It surprises me that this film aired with all of its extreme violence  yet Takashi Miike's offering was deemed too disturbing.  Once Jake sees the pelts he could care less about the mutilated bodies he has to step over to get to his prized possession. He declares them the best pelts he has seen in  twenty years and believes that they are just what he needs to get the two things he wants most out of life : a successful business and Shanna. He pays Shanna a visit at work (what she is doing when Jake arrives is  funny and erotic) and asks her to model the furs in an upcoming fashion show. Sensing an opportunity to manipulate Jake further Shanna teases him with sexual advances before agreeing to his wish. She wants the furs for herself. Jake does a little investigating and discovers that the furs are a special kind coming from magical raccoons who once presided over their own city. They were the guardians of that city and the magical powers that they once possessed now cause anyone who comes into contact with these furs to commit violent acts of self mutilation and murder. Each murder is in keeping with how these animals are slaughtered.  The film is a little goofy and over the top but Argento knows what people expect from  him and he doesn't disappoint. The murders are gross and there is tons of blood and intestines spilling all over the screen. Easier on the eyes is Shanna who is  a stripper who actually takes her clothes off in a movie. Some films you might read that an actress is half naked for most of the film but in this case it's not an exaggeration. Actress Ellen Ewusie appears nude in every scene that she has in this film.  Meat Loaf is a lot of  fun as Jake. His portrayal of a sleazy guy driven mad  by desire was so intense that I was reminded of Jack Nicholson at times. John Saxon makes you wish he had more scenes before he is brutally murdered. The score by regular Argento composer Claudio Simonetti is very spooky and recalls the nursery rhyme from Deep Red in a couple of scenes towards the end. Pelts is gross as hell but it's one of the funnest horror films in a while since it tells a crazy story about murderous raccoons and features  tons of gratuitous gore and nudity.",Masters of Horror: Pelts

Not only the worst thing Dickens ever wrote but the easiest way to kill what might otherwise have been an enjoyable romp at the movies.  I'm not sure that lowering one's expectations would've helped this one too much.  Even in bad movies, one can still enjoy themselves by feeling ""involved"".  I found it very hard to relate to the main character.The film starts with forbidden love between a Thai mafia women named Zin (Ammara Siripong) and a Yakuza (Hiroshi Abe) that results in an autistic baby girl.  The Thai mafia separates the couple and Zin raises the girl, Zen (newcomer JeeJa Yanin).  Zen grows up watching martial arts films and running from flies.  She has an uncanny ability to mimic the intricate moves she sees on the screen, in addition to other skills.  When her mother falls ill and cannot afford the treatment, Zen and her friend find a diary that list many people who owe money to Zin.  Zen then goes about retrieving said cash.I have been super-geeked about seeing this ever since I watched the trailer last year sometime.  To call it a letdown would be an understatement.  I expected the plot to be crap, so I wasn't too upset about that.  I wanted to see the cool fights that everyone was talking about.  Other than the last 20 minutes of the film, the fights suck.  Zen goes to place after place demanding cash.  She is then laughed at and attacked.  She fights dude after dude until the boss is scared and hands over the money.  These fights consist of being attacked one by one, with every dude throwing one punch (that's so slow a statue could dodge it) before getting kicked in the face.HOWEVER I will admit that the finale is AWESOME!  The last 20 minutes will induce more than its fair share of cringes as stunt-men earn their money the old-fashioned way:  Brutally!  The whole bag of tricks is emptied here.  Some fantastic Muay Thai moves with a little Tae Kwon Do thrown in.JeeJa Yanin is more than capable of performing some sweet moves and I can't wait to see her in more stuff.  This, however, I probably could've done without.  The presentation from the Magnolia DVD is stellar with a widescreen picture and the option of an English dub or subtitles.  The special features are limited to a ""making of"" segment.  I may be the only person who doesn't like this movie (as a whole), so please take my review with a grain of salt.

1280591,"My wife and I recently made plans to go check out a movie with another couple.  When differences arose on which movie we were to see, ""G.I. Joe:  The Rise of Cobra"" became the choice of compromise.  Despite having played with G.I. Joe toys and watching the cartoon series when I was young, I fully planned to wait for this film to hit the DVD shelves before I watched it.  There just wasn't anything too appealing about it based on the previews.Having now viewed it I must say that it was a pleasant surprise.The plot is rather simple.  In this film, James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston), an arms dealer with a checkered family history, joins forces with a sinister scientist known only as The Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the duo plan to take over the world by threatening it with nanomite weapons.  These weapons can literally eat through metal (and pretty much everything else).  When a convoy of these weapons, led by two soldiers codenamed Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans), is attacked and the nano-weapons are stolen, the international force known as G.I. Joe is sent to retrieve them.From that point on, the film is basically one CGI-laced battle after another.  Fight sequences go from the Joe headquarters to France to the icy waters of the North Pole.  Hand-to-hand combat, ""accelerator"" suits, ninjas, computerized crossbows, etc. all take center stage as the action spills out on the screen.Like many other big-budget action yarns this film suffers in a number of areas.  Heading the list of things that are wrong with this film is Channing Tatum.  He tries to come across as a leader but instead looks more like a lightweight John Cena (WWE).  Tatum ain't no Duke, and his performance here goes to show that his poor delivery in ""Havoc"" was no misstep on his part.  Another thing wrong with this film is the fact that it's covered in cheese.  Granted, it's based on a toyline from the 80's, but it would have been nice if the film had been taken a bit more seriously.  Otherwise, the scriptwriters should have gotten rid of some of the strong language and aimed for a more kid-friendly PG rating.I also found that despite the busy nature of the film, it was rather boring at times.  With little character development, it became nothing more than a ""that explosion was cool, but wait until you see the next one"" series of CGI sequences.There's plenty that's bad about this film, but there is also quite a bit that is good.  As nothing more than an action film, it works wonders.  The CGI does look excellent and the numerous vehicles and weapons that are used in the film turned out great.Although Tatum was miscast as Duke, the majority of the other characters were given decent representations.  Mired in bad one-liners, Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as Hawk.  Christopher Eccleston is sufficient as McCullen/Destro, but much like Quaid he has to swim his way through bad writing.  Rachel Nichols (Scarlett) gives one of the best performances in the film, and Said Taghmaoui is quite enjoyable as Breaker.  Sienna Miller filled out the Baroness' black suit quite well, but her delivery was only average.Other actors who did quite well were Ray Park as the silent and deadly Snake Eyes, Lee Byung-hun as Snake Eyes' arch enemy, Stormshadow and Arnold Vosloo in a small but sinister role as Zartan.Two actors in particular deserve kudos for their performances in this film.  When I first saw that Marlon Wayans was going to portray Ripcord, I immediately smelled a stinky film.  However, Wayans does surprisingly well as the humorous Ripcord.  Deserving even more praise is Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Although he wasn't perfect as the Doctor/Cobra Commander, he has shown marked improvement from his ""Havoc"" and ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" days.  He was a pleasant surprise.There are also a few old faces that pop up.  Director Stephen Sommers reached deep into his ""The Mummy"" bag and pulled out Vosloo, Brendan Fraser in a cameo role and Kevin J. O'Connor as Dr. Mindbender.  Screen veteran Jonathan Pryce (""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Twelve Monkeys"") plays the President of the United States.Overall, ""G.I. Joe:  The Rise of Cobra"" is a mixed bag of great action sequences and solid individual performances weighed down by a poor choice for a leading man, a dull script and too much focus on the ""wow"" factor.  If you like pop, sizzle, and bang in your movies, ""Joe"" is an excellent film to check out.  If you expect your films to develop a little bit more and not rely on CGI to cover up weaknesses, you might want to stay away from ""The Rise of Cobra.""  Mildly recommended to action fans.

It's a common theme in many similar films and to be honest, I didn't see anything here, that made this movie stand out from the rest of them. This is just another coming of age film without many surprises. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. The acting was OK, as was the pace of the film. I'm finding it really difficult to say anything positive or negative about White Irish Drinkers, because the truth is, it's just a simple, ordinary story that I've seen a hundred times before. The names and places always change, and there was a familiar face or two, but nothing about this film stands out positively or negatively in any way. It's just a very common type of story with a very ordinary cast. Everyone does their job and the story gets told, I don't know what you'll think, but my reaction to this film was simple neutrality. A decent movie, but easily forgotten, as nothing made any kind of impact on me at all.",N/A

292863,"The Gate is a fantastically frightening supernatural thriller that will have your kids hiding behind the sofa more than once. A worthless first half is thankfully redeemed by some very impressive special effects in the second half and a terrific sense of atmosphere endures throughout. It's an old film (circa 1987) but The Gate still holds up well and is worth a look. Of particular interest is the fact that this is Stephen Dorff's first film role...and one of the better creature features of the 1980's. It's definitely what 80's 'B' grade horror is all about...heroic kids in way over their heads and going toe to toe with apocalyptic evil. Man...it's so horror nostalgic it brings a tear of joy to my eye, but the thing that made this particular movie great was it's emphasis on subtle creepiness rather that just straight out shocks and gore...and whilst some of the acting, clothes and hairdos leave a lot to be desired (hey...we're talkin' the 80's here kids) it's so much darn FUN to watch...even today. Now don't get me wrong...this film is as cheezy as they come and all you 'Freddy vs. Jason' fed youngsters out there will probably think that it's lame...but for us gen 'Xers' this is cult- classic gold. And, man...was that girl Alexandra HOT or WHAT?! Raaghrr!By the way if you're a fan of this film you may want to keep your eyes open for the 3D remake that is apparently on it's way to a cinema near you!

544142,"The hard truth is that it's been tough to be a John Carpenter fan for the past decade or so.Sure we remember that this the guy who gave us such classics as ""Assault on Precinct 13,""  ""Halloween,"" ""Escape From New York,"" and ""The Thing.""  Even his box office disappointments(""Big Trouble In Little China"", ""They Live"") were still better and more interesting than just about anything else to hit multiplex screens during his glory years of the mid-seventies through eighties.But by the early 1990s, Carpenter hit a slump that saw him cranking out one schlock film after another.  Think of  ""In the Mouth of Madness"" or ""Vampires.""For this reason, I was more than a little skeptical when ""Ghosts of Mars"" hit theaters last summer.  Even aside from J.C.'s recent track record, the film seemed a pastiche of other pop culture sources like ""Pitch Black,"" Ray Bradbury's ""The Martian Chronicles, and even Carpenter's own ""Precinct 13.""  But my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to take a chance.My verdict?  Forget all the negative hype about this film.  It's the movie Carpenter fans have been waiting for.Granted the film isn't the least bit scary.  It also doesn't ponder any weighty philosophical or political questions, like some of Carpenter's earlier films.  What it does offer however is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi action pic that delivers plenty of ass-kickin' action with Carpenter's trademark cynicism thrown in to boot.I won't rehash the plot, since odds are you've already read the summary above.  Instead, I'll focus on some other things I liked about this film, like the cast.  I'll believe Ice Cube is a great actor when I see him convincingly play a brain surgeon, a priest, or something other than another variation of the same scowling bad ass he played in his debut film, ""Boyz In the Hood"" years ago.  Still when a scowling badass is what you want, this rapper is your man and his persona(he basically plays himself in every movie) serves him well here.As for Natasha Henstridge, no matter what she does she'll probably always be thought of as ""The babe from the `Species' movies.""  But the script smartly plays off her ""hottie"" status, by having her cop deftly fend off sexual advances from both her female commanding officer(Pam Grier) and her fellow officer(Jason Statham).  She's smart as a whip and tough as nails.The supporting cast, is also full of interesting picks, Statham and Clea Duvall are two of my favorite character actors and 70s-film goddess Grier is always fun to watch though I wish she had more to do here.Also worth noting is the action.  It's been years, since Carpenter did a balls-out action film, and it looks like this script really got his juices flowing.  The action scenes here just flat out rock.Lastly, though the film's overall storyline is nothing special or inventive it's biggest asset is that it does succeed in drawing the viewer in.  After watching this movie, I found myself wanting to know more about these characters, about the true nature of the film's ""Martians,"" and about the matriarchal human society that came to rule the red planet.Though the film's dissappointing performance at the box offices puts the prospects of a sequel in doubt, I have to say it would be more than a little interesting to revisit the characters and story elements introduced here.I only saw the film in the theatre so I cannot comment on the DVD release.  However, the extras listed here pretty much guarantees that I will buy it at some point in the near future although I have only one quibble:  Why no Ice Cube commentary?Bottom line though, this movie is really a must for JC fans and anyone who likes the sci-fi action genre. John Carpenter is back and back in fine form.",N/A

1078922,"""Fracture"" (2007) is directed by Gregory Hoblit who has also made ""Frequency"" (2000), ""Fallen"" (1998) both of which I like and ""Primal Fear"" (1996) - his feature debut that I love.Crime /Thriller/Mystery /Court Drama are among my favorite genres and as long as the combination of these genres is clever, gripping, atmospheric, well acted, keeps me guessing and entertains me, I am happy. I know that many viewers were very insightful and figured out the twists and the ending within first half of hour or so but I did not and I was impressed by the way the disappearance of the crucial evidence had been handled - very clever. Besides being an entertaining crime movie, the most interesting element of ""Fracture"" is a struggle of wills and intellects between two main characters, self-made inventor - millionaire Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who shot his unfaithful wife in the face and put her in a coma and young, successful and smart assistant D.A. Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), who has a 97% conviction rate and is assigned to prosecute Crawford just when he is ready to accept a lucrative offer from the prestigious LA law firm. The game of cat and mouse that highly intelligent and malevolent Crawford plays with Beachum makes the film interesting and the scenes between Hopkins (in his ""playful Dr. Lector"" mode) and Gosling (whose character does change as he realizes what he is dealing with from the unsympathetic self-centered hot shot to the man who becomes obsessed by the case, vows to put the murderer behind the bars and makes it his priority) - riveting and joy to watch. I also would like to mention David Strathairn as Willy's boss, DA Joe Lobuto in yet another understated effective performance. Strathairn's Lobuto is so interesting that he could be a main character in another move. ""Fracture"" is not perfect. For example, Willy's affair with Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike), a beautiful lawyer and his perspective boss was lifeless - they did not have any chemistry together. I think that Nikki's purpose in the movie was to introduce Willy to her father, a judge, whose help he would desperately need in one of the later scenes. I'd rather prefer more scenes between Willy and Crawford but even the way it was, the movie kept my attention all the way through and despite the rather weak ending, I found ""Fracture"" quite good.3.5/5",N/A

Basically, the feelings to be explored in this film weren't all wondrous for me to understand. It was a very similar picture to Lost in Translation, which revived the genre that Paris, Texas followed through. Certainly, pictures like that weren't ideal entertainment for me because the message was often unclear and obscure.

682359,"I was expecting ""The Anniversary Party"", co-written and co-directed by Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh, to be a loosely-scripted, improv-heavy excuse for a bunch of their actor friends to get together in front of the camera and show off their instruments.  What I found instead was a semi-tightly plotted dissection of a marriage teetering on the brink of dissolution, a commentary on the nature of celebrity in a celebrity-saturated market, and a worthy exhibition of exhilaration and pathos.  That is until the film's last hour, which degenerates into a loosely-scripted, improv-heavy excuse for a bunch of actors friends to get together in front of the camera and show off their instruments.  Ad nauseum.Simply structured into five easily-defined segments, the film begins with many gestures of goodwill, which are slowly stripped away as it refuses to finally end.The prologue introduces Joe Therrian (Cumming) and Sally Nash (Leigh).  The first shots of the film feature a sleeping Cumming being observed by Leigh in bed, on the morning of their sixth wedding anniversary.  This segues into a quiet little scene where they both do yoga in the backyard.  These two moments, as well as a later bedroom scene, establish the pair's relationship instantly, while also subtly alluding to important plot points to come.  This is the film's strength, its use of moments and details, picked up only by the most observant viewer, that define character instantly and allude to moments to come.  It is because of this that the film holds up well on second viewing.The next segment shows Joe and Sally greeting their various guests as they arrive for the anniversary party.  Just as Joe and Sally are introduced in tableau during the film's first scenes, so do these short moments explicate the well-defined relationships between the guests and their hosts.  It's the kind of crowd that features both a recent Oscar winner, and a former Booker Prize recipient, a menagerie of talented and egocentric personalities that is vibrant and entertaining, promising at least some good times ahead.  For the most part, they deliver.Once everyone has arrived, the party begins, made up of two long sequences that do an awful lot in terms of defining character, and, especially in the second one, constructing Joe and Sally's backstory.The first is a rousing game of charades, that some take way too seriously (ratcheting up the tension) while others treat as a lark.  It's notable for the way relationships are further cemented, and for the way it sets new ones down a rocky path.The second sequence has everyone stand up in front of the crowd, one by one, presenting either a song or a joke or a dance number as an ode to Joe and Sally.  There were one too many songs, for my liking, especially since each said basically the same thing (we're glad you're back, Joe, don't ever leave our Sally again).  Kevin Kline and daughter do a wonderful balletic interpretive dance of Joe and Sally's marriage.  The little girl appears to be having the time of her life, adopting a mock serious face between bouts of cracking up.  Kline, to his credit, lets her steal the spotlight.  Mostly, this sequence is useful in that it manages to get all the things better left unsaid out in the open, as some of the guests inadvertently peel back the skin of the couple of the hour, the better to expose their inner wounds.It is dubious, however, for the last person to present, Paltrow's Davidson, thinks it a good deal to offer 15 capsules of Ecstasy to this erratic group.  From this point on, the film is a train wreck masquerading as theatre of the absurd.Now, I'm all for giving a repressed group, one with issues as delicious as these people's, an opportunity to bear their souls.  But when that opportunity is only achieved through chemistry, it feels like cheating to me.  The revelations are tainted in some way.  Which is exactly what happens here.The other problem is that this section of the movie goes on and on and on.  It tramples over nearly all the goodwill that Cumming and Leigh worked so hard to build up over the film's first half.  What was once a prudently structured little film, turns violently into a jumbled mess.  Most obnoxious here is Cumming and Leigh's little blow up scene.  Every other word is a curse; every line is punctuated by implausible hysterics and tears.  These are two wonderful actors, who've just finished proving that during the film's first half.  Poof.  All gone.  It's an unwatchable scene, one that a more seasoned director would have guided home much more ably.Once the Ecstasy has worn off (ironically, the ecstasy of the film wore off just as Ecstasy the drug made its appearance), the film can get down to the business of finally ending.  Hold your horses!  There's the denouement to consider.  Or was it an epilogue?  No matter.Where conventionally closure should exist, one last wrench is thrown into the works, and somehow, this brings peace and resolution to the characters.  I didn't think it possibly, but Cumming and Leigh almost save this mess.  Still, I didn't buy the peace and resolution this last bit brought on.  Thankfully, I suspect the filmmaker's don't either.  The last shot, which bears a striking resemblance to the film's first shot, shows that the issues are left unresolved.  What we have is a just a temporary ceasefire.In the end, ""The Anniversary Party"" is little more than a vanity piece by Cumming and Leigh, an opportunity to make a personal film on the cheap, about some particularly vain people.  Which, I suppose, makes the whole endeavor rather appropriate.  If you dare R.S.V.P. to this ""Party"", take my advice and leave just after the sun goes down.",N/A

504354,"I found this to be a fairly involving, fairly well done adaptation of Agatha Christie's often-filmed novel, but like 1965's ""Ten Little Indians"", this version also suffers from needless humor and a softening of the original story's bleak conclusion.  At least the humor here works a little better than the '65 version.I'm told that this version, as well as the '65 version, heavily rely on the stage adaptation of the Christie novel, the origin of the more upbeat conclusion.  Apparently, the thinking was that- unlike the book- one or two characters had to remain alive at the end to explain things to the audience.  I don't know... I think I could figure out several ways to dramatize the original novel without softening the proceedings.  But maybe I'm just a morbid person and grumble at happy endings.Storywise, this '45 film and the '65 film not only rely on the same ending, but- for the most part- they feature the same exact story beats, making one wonder why the '65 version was even made. It certainly didn't attempt anything new (besides casting hip actors and employing an out-of-place ""mod"" jazz score).  Though, admittedly, Shirley Eaton was more fetching than any of the actresses on display here.Anyway, enough with my meandering thoughts about this or that adaptation.  With its nice sets, solid direction, and bevy of old English acting pros, this particular movie is certainly worth a look, and so is the '65 version (though marginally less so).  But by all means don't let these films take the place of the original work, which remains a great old tale, masterful in the way it successfully combines the usually opposing forces of bleakness and strong entertainment value.",N/A

There is brief nudity and sexual situations as one would expect from such a movie, but it is minimal considering the topic. Of course Pesci drops the f-bomb like only Pesci can.

653467,"I have to say that Micheal Bay was very fortunate that this is a new generation. And the fact that a lot of younger people are not familiar with the original franchise people were willing to compromise. It is always people that don't have the knowledge of a franchise are the ones that have the ability to make it happen. Because I truly believe anyone that was a true fan of the franchise would have kept the designs as true to character as possible. The only person remotely that looked like themselves was Optimus Prime. Starscream was really poorly designed and Megatron. In the extra footage ""they stated that they changed the design of megatron because they didn't want people carrying him around ? Megatron should have been a cannon on a tripod and it should have resembled the character more than that. That was the beauty of the series the cool distinct designs of the robots. Sure you have to update but at least try to update to make them look similar. I mean we do not have robots walking around the planet now. So anything would have been futuristic in this day in age. Sound wave was an amazing character he was reduced to a parasite (Frenzy). I really couldn't tell what Megatron was when he transformed to either form he just looked like a big mass of metal. There were no color definition in any of the Decepticon's  or anything. Bumblebee and Prime I can say were the only justice that was done. Shea was ok in the film but it should have been more about the robots than him. Over all the CGI was done right it looked very real. And the movie had energy but I just hated the poor designs and poor character development. Soundwave, Megatron and Starcream were amazingly designed characters even in the 80's. And are main driving forces in the cartoon and deserved better justice ! I hope that if Micheal Bay isn't in charge of Part 2 these things are addressed. In the original cartoon they all mutated as the generations changed so they still can make it happen the right way, hopefully they will. The only reason I am willing to except this because at least an effort was made. And I have waited on this 20 years. I am really hoping the Voltron movie stays true to form.

159123,"THE STAR WARS movies (the original trilogy) are perhaps some of the greatest movies ever made.  They had great characters, a fantastic story, brilliant acting (at some parts) and were just all around fun.  I grew up, of course, after they came to theaters, but like most people, I had them on VHS.  I was also one of the millions of people who said Star Wars deserved a huge DVD release.  In 2004 I got it, and much to my dismay, it wasn't exactly what I expected.  Some of the changes are not for the better.  On the contrary, the majority of them are worse.  The DVD set released in 2005 is essentially the same, only you don't have bonus features... which is alright, the bonus features were nothing special anyway.  The release in 2004 had four documentaries (the only good one being the A&E; Special: Star Wars: Empire of Dreams), an XBOX demo (not a big XBOX fan) Star Episode III Preview (useless now) and commentary.  That was about it (at least the bulk), and after such a long wait I wanted more.  Like say... the holiday special that I, someone who grew up in the 90's NEVER got to see.  Ever (say sorry).  I also wanted the indiviual makings of the movies.  When this DVD relese came around, I was disappointed that none of that stuff was included.Star Wars was full of fun, action, loveable characters (well developed too), story and just about everything that could make a good movie.

With how successful and well accepted the films became, why did George Lucas decide to change it?  Especially to connect it with the prequels?The changes aren't just small things either.  They're things that have me pretty upset.  I'm talking more than just ""Who shot first?  Han or Greedo?"" (but we all know the scene really is messed up and somehow lessens Hans' character).  What I'm talking about are the even bigger changes such as Hayden Christensen appearing in Return of the Jedi, the CGI which is supposed to be superior, but looks a lot worse.  I'm also tired of Lucas doing things like, replacing real life extras with CGI characters.  This might stem from the fact that then Lucas had virtually nothing to work with, and now he has just about everything to work with.  He's opting for Computers over raw talent.  I'm not against computers, I'm just saying these films were already perfect the way they were, and now that Lucas has come in trying to make them even more perfect, he's destroying them.  A trilogy that once stood above everything, is now being reduced.  Boba Fett's voice is now the same one who did Jengo Fett in the prequels, Anakin's ghost is Hayden Christensen, even the music score has been altered to some extent.  Conversations have been altered with terrible dialogue (most notably is the conversation between Darth Vader and the Emperor in The Empire Strikes Back), things that were already given CGI treatment for the 1997 release were given even more CGI treatment and it looks terrible (most notably, Jabba the Hutt in A New Hope).Overall, I'm disappointed with the DVD release.  And this isn't the last to come.  According to IMDB, Lucas has another release of the trilogy scheduled for release in 2007.  I probably won't pick that one up.The 1997 release was much better than this.  The 1993 release even better.  Movies shouldn't be altered to let them compete with ""newer"" movies.  I think people have enough common sense to say to themselves, ""You can't expect a movie made in 1977 to look like a movie made in 2006.""  There's a reason why the color version of Casablanca caused an uproar, and there's a reason why the original Star Wars trilogy being tweaked is causing an uproar.  You're supposed to preserve classics, not ruin them.  I doubt Lucas will ever let people nostalgic for the original have it.  Honestly, he should have two sets out.  One that's completely the original versions, every single mistake every CGI taken out and everything we loved about the original and one with all these ""tweaks"" for those who actually like them (you can always strap that one with a warning sticker or something).  But don't limit our choices to only being able to have a trilogy that's been tarnished.I'll let it slide with a three.  Three stars because they were three great movies.  But some of these changes aren't for the better.  Digitally restored pictures and sound I can deal with, altered sequences I can't.",Star Wars Trilogy THX Digitally Mastered Edition

571681,"The story behind the filming of Gore Vidal's novel is by now legendary; the finished film has been savaged by critics since its release in 1970. In truth Michael Sarne's version isn't as bad as all that: the film offers a suggestive view of how gender constructions are constructed in different societies, and how prejudice often inhibits individuals from expressing themselves.  Hence Myra's (Raquel Welch's) desire to take revenge on those members of the patriarchy who oppress her. Sarne's film uses images of the Golden Age of Hollywood to contrast the grimy reality of present-day (i.e. late 60s) America with the dream-factory world portrayed onscreen.  There are some truly bizarre elements: with her fake blonde wig and reedy voice, Mae West resembles a hellish version of Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950). Rex Reed's acting is perfunctory, while John Huston delivers his lines with tongue firmly planted in cheek. Nonetheless the film is still worth attention,",N/A

Anyone who loved Frank Marsales' smoking jazz soundtracks for early Warner Bros. shorts will adore the rip-roarin' theme of this little-known series.Unfortunately, the reason these cartoons are &quot;forgotten&quot; is that the vast majority of them feature racist images which we, thankfully, no longer have to be subjected to as a part of popular culture. While a cartoon historian can accept them as a common aspect of this genre, most people will probably find them offensive enough to wish to avoid this series of releases altogether.

1496936,"The ""Based on a True Story"" hook of PUNCTURE wears its welcome not too long after the first act, but it's a powerful punch of a first act. In essence, this is the tale of the small Houston personal injury law firm Danzinger and Weiss who, on behalf of a nurse dying of AIDS from an accidental needle stick, take on Big Medical and their vast monopoly over the products they produce. It's a pretty predictable tale all around from anyone who's seen pretty much any legal drama ever. The characters are pretty stock as well as the plot. We have longtime character actor Marshall Bell (from just about every film you've seen since the mid-80's) as the grizzled, ornery designer of the live-saving safety needles; Brett Cullen (most recently seen on PERSON OF INTEREST) as the slick-as-a-snake big-time defense attorney; Mark Kassen (the film's co-director, with his brother Adam) as Paul Danzinger, the responsible, practical and harried partner; Vinessa Shaw (perhaps best known for her role as ""Domino"" in Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT) as the dying nurse that kickstarts the film's tale and Michael Biehn as the shadowy and mysterious man that seems to be pursuing the protagonists, who we don't know is friend or foe. Doesn't sound very original, does it?That's until you factor in Chris Evans as Mike Weiss, the other half of the firm. Weiss is a pretty serious drug addict as we see very early on in the film. In a dynamic introduction to his character, he's been on a bender of cocaine in a dumpy motel room and is preparing questions for a witness and practices on another user. As we also see early on, Weiss has a very unusual lifestyle (he keeps an alligator in a wading pool; he drinks health-nut juices like wheat grass while constantly abusing his body with cocaine, an assortment of pills, heroin, etc.) and is rapidly heading for a divorce presumably due to his constant affairs and his rampant drug use. But when he meets Shaw's character and sees what is going on in the medical supply industry, it becomes less about the kind of ambulance-chasing law they've been doing and more about starting something on a possibly global scale. This, of course, awakens something perhaps long dormant within him about what being a lawyer is really about.Evans, despite his more recent star-turns as Captain America, is a consumate actor who really gives Weiss a sense of perpetual mania; when he's in motion, he is almost hyperkinetic, but when he crashes, he crashes hard. There's rarely a moment in the film where his character hits a false note, and the story is infinitely more interesting when he's on screen. As charming and energetic as Evans is, he shows a deeply vulnerable side that he rarely gets a chance to show when he isn't busy commanding superheroes.The film does a commendable yet all-too-predictable job of showing how hard it is for a small law firm to take on a large cabal of evil corporations and their machinations and influence over other businesses, the government, and perhaps even life itself as the film's climax is met with echoes of the great Meryl Streep film SILKWOOD. All of the performances, while rote, are effective with the exception of Mark Kassen, who just seems a little out of his depth here. The film is directed with some style but the film doesn't want to take too many risks by making Weiss out to be a bad guy, or to explore the darker sides of his life in too much depth, which is sad because the film is almost clone-like in its ERIN BROCKOVICH construction and it could benefit by bringing something much more unusual to the table that really sets it apart.Aside from Evans' performance, PUNCTURE is a take-it-or-leave-it legal drama that has moments that stay with you, but unfortunately, they're too few and far between.",Puncture
1534793,"THE DEAD WANT WOMENI am a huge Full Moon fan and own most of the films if not all of them in some form. So every year when October rolls around and I get even more into watching all my horror films. True I watch them all year long but Halloween time makes them just a little more special. I wish I could say that this film is just as special but sadly it is not. This for a Full Moon film is average at best, I love these types of flicks but it just fell flat most of the time.The story is about a silent movie star who is having one of the best nights of her life. Her career is going great and all her friends are at her house for a party. All of that is great until she is informed that her contract with the studio is being cancelled. The new age of talking pictures has stopped her career cold. In receiving this information she kills her entourage as well as herself condemning them to a life stuck in that house. Fast forward to the here and now and two female relaters are excited to be selling the old house. After meeting there to finalize the deal with the new buyer the women are attacked by the long thought gone inhabitants of the house. What's worse is they may be a part of something bigger.It is easy to see what director Charles Band was going for here, that old school Hollywood look and feel. As for the overall feeling of the film I think he accomplished that. Still this film just falls flat even with band accomplishing what he wanted to. The story is cool enough story but it wasn't executed correctly I guess. As for the acting it is exactly what it should have been for this type of flick but even that feels out of place in a film where it should have been right at home. Everything about this flick is cheesy B movie badness, oh how I wish it was cheesy B movie goodness. Even with Eric Roberts it is a bit of a let down.The zombie makeup is good for this kind of flick but they look more ghoul/demon like then zombie like. Still I take that as a good thing as I do with the other thing this movie did right, the ladies. Well not just the ladies but the ladies and the lack of their clothes. For a good portion of this movie it is almost a porno at one point as the silent starlet and her crew are into some very freaky things. So over this entire movie isn't all bad, I would have loved a Videozone for this. That would have been excellent, or maybe a commentary from Band himself.",N/A

288942,"Unlike a lot of reviewers, I won't totally trash Rocky V. It actually had a decent story but there was just something that it lacked in terms of trying to be the final Rocky.Certain parts in the film actually are pretty good but they just don't go together very well. While none of the sequels equal the original Rocky (with the exception of Rocky Balboa), all of them seem to have a flow to them that this one kind of lacked. In fact, when I view this film, I rarely look at the whole thing. Most of the time, I forward it to the end with the streetfight which is probably the best part in the whole film! If you notice, the new Rocky barely mentions Rocky V except for the phrase ""Home Team"" when he was talking to his son!

He doesn't know where it came from, only that it is new and not yet illegal.  But the drug was originally destroyed by the Church for a reason as the idiot's roommate finds out by accident.  The drug causes some users to thirst for blood and become animalistic.  It was the origin of the vampire myths.  Now a Berkeley student rediscovered it and lost control of it.Once the danger is known, the roommate tries to tell the idiot but he refuses to listen.  Eventually the party occurs and the drug is passed out.  It then becomes a battle of survival for those who did not take the drug.  On the one hand, the people trying to kill them will stop once the drug wears off.  On the other hand, killing them first seems the best defense.  Can they be trapped or tied up?  Is there any escape?  Watch and find out.This one was better than I expected.  I read a lot of bad reviews after I saw an intriguing trailer.  Now I am glad I decided to check it out.  Not a bad little story.  Although vampire legends go back three-thousand years this plot gives a nice take on the whole idea even if it really doesn't work.  The acting is what you would expect for the quality.  Our main character (the girl on the cover with the amazing nose) goes through some interesting soul searching and moral dilemmas that are usually missing in this type of film.

737286,"""13 Rue Madeleine,"" (1947).  This American postwar black and white World War II spy thriller was deliberately held back until the end of the war, to avoid giving the Axis powers any clue as to how our new spy service, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), worked.  It's a classic action/adventure/drama, directed by Henry Hathaway, filmed on location in Quebec, standing in for occupied France, in a semi-documentary style that was new then, and had audiences flocking to the theaters. Viewers may notice that, to be extra careful, the OSS is never mentioned by name in this film.  Louis de Rochmont produced; he and Hathaway had also made the New York based World War II spy thrillerThe House on 92nd Street (Fox Film Noir), pioneering the semi-documentary style. 13 RUE MADELEINE now survives in an uneasy half-life, probably because of its star, James Cagney. The pint-sized former song and dance man -- and ultimate player of gangsters -- plays Robert Emmett ""Bob"" Sharkey, former spy himself, kicked upstairs to teach the first classes of fledgling spies at O.S.S.Sharkey finds that one of his agents in training is a Nazi double, but decides not to arrest him.  Instead, Sharkey decides to feed the double agent false information about the Allied invasion of Europe.  Meanwhile, a team of agents goes to France to find a secret V-2 rocket depot.  But the German spy has not been fooled, murders another of Sharkey's men, and manages to rejoin his people.  He now knows too much and Sharkey has made a decision that came back to haunt him.  Knowing he faces tremendous risks, Sharkey goes into France himself to try to clean up his mess.Cagney, (Yankee Doodle Dandy,The Public Enemy) receives able support from the beauteous French actress Annabella, who was married to heartthrob Tyrone Power at the time.  However, she's wasted in her part as Suzanne de Beaumont, telegraph operator.  Also providing able backing are Richard Conte (Perchance to Dream) as Bill O'Connell; Frank Latimore as Jeff Lassiter; Walter Abel(The Green Light) as Sharkey's boss Charles Gibson, and Sam Jaffe (Ben Hur) as Mayor Galimard of the French village in the eye of the storm.  The young actors Red Buttons and Karl Malden have unaccredited parts as jump masters.  The young E.G. Marshall plays Emile.  The notorious Russian spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg appear as themselves in archival footage.The movie is dated, sometimes unrealistic, perhaps excessively patriotic and nave for modern tastes but Cagney and Conte have meaty roles and do well by them.  Oh, and the title?  13 Rue Madeleine is the address of the Gestapo in Le Havre, nearest big city to where the action in France is taking place.  It becomes important in the film, though not necessarily to the viewer.  However, the film still has some entertainment value thanks to its players.",13 Rue Madeleine

It is directed by and stars Jaques Tati. The original French title is &quot;Le Vacances de M.

996059,"Made by BBC Films, this has something of the feel of well made television drama.  The story is simple, and quite familiar, but still manages to raise questions as to how a person's decisions are not radically free - perhaps an obvious point, but one that seems to bear repeating, especially given the context, namely, a released convict from an underprivileged background.  For Ricky, starting afresh means rejecting not just his own past misdeeds, but also his friends - and rejecting his friends (whatever there unfixable faults) is not just difficult, it also comes close to being immoral, so Ricky is truly torn.The influence of family is also well presented, and some of the gaps speak as loud as the presences, for instance the lack of a biological father in his life. The social realities are shown matter-of-factly and the film stops well short of being preachy.Curtis, as the twelve year old brother, is a charismatic figure, as is his friend Rio, but some of the other actors struggle to bring their characters to life - at times it's a little bit too obvious that they are 'acting'.  The camerawork, editing, and music all have a suitably 'realistic' English TV aesthetic.Perhaps not a classic, but worth a look.",Bullet Boy
466497,"I haven't as yet seen this DVD (I fully plan to as Jackie Chan dubbed on this release I am told).  The 3 stars are for the movie itself.  It is not the best Jackie Chan Hong Kong movie, the Police Story series and Project A 1 &amp; 2 are much better but is definitely worth a look.  I have seen an old dubbed version (OK) and the Asian DVD release (better).  Before approaching any &quot;old&quot; Jackie Chan film (ie. ones done in Hong Kong before America!) viewers should be aware they are lower budgeted so don't have the capacity for special effects as in US movies.  Also, what a Chinese considers funny might not necessarily be what a westerner thinks is funny!  Keeping this in mind, I really liked this film.  The story is &quot;old&quot; (ie. twins separated at birth and coming together later in life with the expected mix-ups) but with Jackie (twice!) it is a lot of fun.  The last action scene in the car factory shows Jackie's amazing acrobatic and martial arts skills to perfection.  If you are Hong Kong movie buff, there are a lot of cameo appearances by HK actors and directors.  Jackie did not direct this film, so ignore any criticism of bad direction by him!  Most of the films Jackie directed himself are superb action pieces, though the acting is not very good in some.

Director Tony Scott employs ADD filmmaking to get Domino's frantic story across.  The constant quick cuts work against the story, but after a while become bearable.  Knightly does an adequate job as the titular character, with great support from Rourke.  Ironically, two of the best roles are Brian Austin Green and Ian Ziering (from ""Beverly Hills 90210"") playing themselves as hosts of a reality show focusing on Domino and her gang.This film will probably either be loved or hated by the average viewer, most likely hated.

990968,"I am unfortunately one of those people that never saw the live performance. Seeing something live helps you appreciate the most minimal staging. So I have nothing to compare and found this an obstruction when concentrating on the music and the story.Based on a play"" Iphigenia in Tauris"" by Greek dramatist Euripides this presentation in four acts was composed by Christoph Willibald von Gluck (July 2, 1714 - November 15, 1787).Even if this is your first foray into the presentation it would be good to know a little bit of the background so you he would have an idea of what the people are trying to say or do. It's very difficult with this particular staging to just dive right in and understand what is going on.At the beginning of the Trojan War the goddess Diane had turned the wins against Agamemnon. To satisfy the goddess Diane Agamemnon had to sacrifice his daughter Iphig&eacute;nie. However Diane saved Iphig&eacute;nie and delivered her to Tauride, where Iphig&eacute;nie served the enemy Scythians as Diane's high priestess. The first act is 15 years after the incident and takes place during a storm that battered Diane's temple at Tauride.You can look up the details ahead of time and then follow the presentation. I have to admit I needed the English subtitles. Maybe later I will not need them.",N/A
950051,"What struck me about this film was the interesting debate between theological speculation and scientific reasoning.  Was Emily Rose's death caused by a evil spirit or was it murder?  Laura Linney and Oscar Nominee Tom Wilkinson give strong performances in this very intriguing motion picture.  Director Scott Derrickson does a great job of trying to keep our interest by giving both side of the arguement without trying to insult our inteligence with a ridiculous and predictable storyline.  A more inexperienced director would have tried to shock us with blood and gore, turning it into a forgetable ""B"" movie.  By not taking the low road, this film actually becomes rather entertaining and spiritual. Don't let the title fool you.  Give this movie a chance.  You might like it, as I did!",N/A

830674,"This movie wasn't flashy and didn't involve a lot of scenery.  It was more one of those films that have you discussing things after it's over.  Fans of Babylon 5 will love Jason Carter as the vampire (he seems to be doing a lot in this genre of late).  It could be considered slow, but in this ADD world I find that a bit refreshing.  The situation felt fairly realistic and some of the movie, dialog, and general concepts were just terrific.So why only 3 stars?  Well, despite some great acting on the part of some of the players the talent was not universally shared amongst the cast.  Some were really stiff, or just plain failed at conveying their characters.  It is something when a bit part prostitute outshines several of the main actors. (very minor spoiler alert) Further the downward spiral of the main doc wasn't believable in my opinion, and neither was the final plot device designed to create the climax.  I also wasn't sure about the vampire's (Jason Carter) motivation, though I suppose some of that was the point.  Still they even mentioned during one scene in the film that if the 1000 year old vampire had been killing people like he had recently, it would have raised more flags, so maybe he wasn't the real killer.  That begs the question, why wasn't the brutal Vlad murders noticed before now?  Did the vampire escalate all of a sudden for some reason?  Did he just stop trying to hide his kills?  And if he can survive on transfused blood, why all the killing in the first place from an otherwise very sophisticated, inquisitive, and otherwise not malicious individual?Despite the negatives, I was still entertained for the full length of the film.  I just wouldn't watch it while very tired or you many not make the ending.",Demon Under Glass
434963,"Directed by Andrew McLaglen (McLintock!, The Wild Geese,The Devil's Brigade) Mitchell (1975), stars Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall) as a tough police detective named Mitchell, who operates by his own set of rules.  While not a classic in the genre, Mitchell is a serviceable enough crime drama, with a decent story, and a pretty good cast.  The action sequences are well done, and include a couple of car chases, and a helicopter pursuing a boat.Mitchell is working on two cases, one involves a wealthy lawyer named Deaney (John Saxon) who gunned down a burglar in his home, and then planted a weapon on the body, to make it appear to be self defense.  Aware that Mitchell suspects him of murder, Deaney tries to buy him off, and also sends a prostitute named Greta (Linda Evans) to Mitchell's apartment.  The cop has no problem with sleeping with her, and later carting her off to jail, for possession of drugs.Mitchell's primary assignment is to observe James Arthur Cummings (Martin Balsam), a man with underworld ties who is suspected of being involved in the importation of a large shipment of drugs.  Eventually both Deaney and Cummings, make attempts to kill Mitchell, but the detective proves to be more plucky and resourceful that he might appear.  Andrew McLaglen is very capable directing action, and after meandering along the film finishes strongly with a gunfight followed by a terrific action sequence, featuring a helicopter chasing a boat out at sea, and then attacking it, using a metal tank as a wrecking ball.  Mitchell displays his fighting skills, wrapping up the case.This is a straight ahead drama without a lot of mystery, as the bad guys are revealed at the start, and know that Mitchell is after them.  With his winning personality and aggressive style, it's not long before Mitchell is breaking and entering, shattering bones, shooting unarmed suspects, and going caveman, bashing in a man's head with a rock.Detectives with quirky personalities are nothing new, but Mitchell is still an unusual guy.  He can be hard and tough, and also rather unsophisticated and crude.  He sometimes plays the fool, although he usually has some idea of what he is doing.  Although immune to monetary bribes, he's perfectly willing to enjoy Greta's charms, while remaining quite detached emotionally.  Mitchell is kind of a jerk, and has a cruel streak, but he also has the resourcefulness and drive to see things through to the end.  Joe Don Baker may occasionally play things a little too cute, but it's still a pretty interesting if uneven performance.Given the story, the acting is not too bad.  John Saxon (Enter the Dragon]]) is good as a scheming crook, and Linda Evans (Big Valley, Dynasty TV series) brings some class to a rather thankless role.  Martin Balsam (Psycho,The Anderson Tapes) is fine, but someone younger and more capable of displaying ruthlessness and toughness, might have worked better.  In an early film appearance, football player turned actor Merlin Olsen (Father Murphy), is a little stiff, but not too bad as Cummings' bodyguard.The film's country music influenced soundtrack, and Mitchell's theme, sung by Hoyt Axton, is very reminiscent of Mike Post's work on The Rockford Files (1974-80).  If you like 70's crime dramas with offbeat detectives, Mitchell is a decent watch.  Some other movies in this genre, from around the same time period, would includeBullitt(1968), Marlowe (1969),Dirty Harry(1971), The French Connection (1971),Shamus(1973),The Laughing Policeman(1973),The Drowning Pool(1975), andSt. Ives(1976).",Mitchell VHS
1633398,"This film had such promise, but then sunk in it's formulaic fashion. The film was so long, and got stuck in places, I had to fast forward at times. A great premise, as I said, but then...Greg Kinnear plays a novelist, divorced but waiting for his ex-wife, played by Jennifeir Connolly to return. He has two children, Samantha, played by Lily Collins, a college student,who probably has the best bit of acting in this film, and Rusty, played by Nat Wolff, a high school student. Nat Wolff has a promising career ahead of him, fresh faced and winsome. Both children have been schooled to be writers as their dear old dad. Dad is very successful, and has the scraggly beard, sloppy look of a writer. Samantha is promiscuous and Nat is not. Dad is still waiting after three years for his ex-wife who has remarried to return.The scenery is beautiful, the acting leaves much to be desired, and the ending clenched the dislike of this film. I could have written this script, but I would be a little more clever.Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 01-11-14",Stuck in Love

1416759,"The genre of film known as ""sword and sandal"" has gone up and down over the years. A staple of films in the late 50s and early 60s the genre lost favor when the age of the anti-hero and film student film makers took over. But in 2000 that changed when GLADIATOR hit the screens and planted Russell Crowe firmly in the position of movie star. More movies followed like TROY and 300. And so it is we now have the latest film based on Greek mythology, IMMORTALS.The story opens by telling us the history of the Gods of Greece, having risen up against the Titans and imprisoning them in Mount Tartarus. The only weapon on Earth that could possibly free the Titans and thus open the world to a war among Gods once more is the Epirus bow, now being sought by King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke).As the army of Hyperion moves forward in search of the bow, villages fall and inhabitants try to stay one step ahead avoiding capture. Young Theseus (Henry Cavill) is a highly skilled warrior trained by an old man in his village (John Hurt). But since his birth was the result of his mother being raped, both are looked down upon and when the time comes to leave they are left behind. This results in Theseus' mother's death when the village is attacked by Hyperion's men and Theseus is captured.While this is going on Hyperion has captured the oracle Phaedra in hopes that she will lead him to the bow he seeks. But it is visions of Theseus that fill her head and she knows that he is the key to stopping Hyperion. When their paths cross Theseus helps leads a revolt against the few guards that hold them prisoner organized by Phaedra and with the help of a thief named Stavros (Stephen Dorff) they set out to bury his mother in his home village.While in the village they discover that the Epirus bow was buried there all along. Theseus recovers the bow but is attacked by Hyperion's beast the Minotaur. Theseus survives and knows his destiny lies in stopping Hyperion. They travel to Phaedra's home only to be overtaken by Hyperion's men and losing the bow. Now it's up to Theseus to join the army that stands against Hyperion and prevent the release of the Titans. And this is just the main story going on here.Along the way Theseus and Phaedra fall in love, politicians fall for Hyperion's tricks and nearly cause the downfall of the civilized world and the Gods speak to Theseus. It seems that the person who trained him was Zeus posing as the old man. Having already told the rest of the Gods that they are not to interfere, he tells Theseus that the Gods can not assist man; they must shine on their own. These were the rules written long ago when the Titans were first imprisoned.Of course this all means that we're bound to see a major battle scene involving the good army against the bad one, a face off between Theseus and Hyperion and the possibility of the release of the Titans if Theseus doesn't quite take care of things. And should they be released, a battle among Gods will surely follow.The movie offers the tale of a hero extremely well and perhaps it's time we told stories of heroes once again. It seems there we find few out there these days in the spotlight and so many are toppled from their pedestals by those who feel we need more truth and less heroes. Myself I'm glad we have heroes to inspire us even if they are in movies and stories only.The special effects are dazzling to watch and fit nicely into the story rather than take it over. Battle scenes are bloody but they would have been since they involved more bludgeoning and blades than anything else. But at least those involved have that gritty look to them as opposed to the freshly starched togas seen in some films.The acting done by all shines here, especially Cavill. That's great to see since he's been tapped to portray Superman in the new film being made. He has the presence to carry that role off which many were concerned about when he was named. If he can make you believe he's the Grecian hero seen here then Superman should be a breeze.The movies being turned out in this genre have all been exceptional and well worth our time as a viewing audience. Many have been worth adding to our collections, including this one. Let's just hope they continue to make them and then discover that the past treasures deserve blu-ray treatment as well. For now we'll have to be content watching releases like IMMORTALS which offer tremendous entertainment.",N/A
731904,"Quick rundown on the narrative, as not to sound too repetitive: Rich woman, wife of a diplomat and clothing designer, seeks rare bird feathers and native art. She meets an Aussie man who, along with another man, two women, and a young boy, are seeking a valley (the title) where they will find utopia (I guess). As they move closer to this valley, she begins to sever ties with her social/bourgeoise life, and sheds any material needs. The group is found to be ""hippies"" by her, and she succumbs to their seemingly inane search for ""the valley.""As I watched this movie, I was reminded of Werner Herzog's ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" (did I say that?!?!). However, Herzog's movie is cinematic genius; Schroeder lacks the same great narrative ability. The shots and ethnographic footage is similar (meeting natives in foggy landscapes), but Herzog ""became"" the film (if you have seen Les Blank's documentary ""Burden of Dreams,"" then you understand what I am describing). This movie relies too much on toeing a line between being an ethnographic movie and a narrative of the time it was made. I believe it fails in both ways, but not as badly as to render the film absolutely awful. I liked it to a point, taking it in as a ""period piece"" (in the vein of a movie like ""Glen and Randa"" or ""Zabriskie Point"") than for face-value. After all, it is about shedding one's pretentious ways for a greater aim. However, it is a bit long and over-winded.The music by Pink Floyd seemed more for a gimmick (to sell the movie) than to give a greater level to the narrative. The film is made like a documentary, but most of what happens is not shocking or really all that imaginative. The constant use of Australians using French seems really crazed! Is every ""white"" person in New Guinea Australian who speak fluent French? The movie also ""feels"" like it should have been made some 5 years BEFORE release. By 1972, I tend to believe that this movie would already have seemed dated.The DVD, by HVE, has some problems. The greatest I found is that there are a couple of scenes in the transfer where one can see the film ""skip."" The filmstrip is noticeable, with sprocket holes and all! Wow. I don't know why.The ""greens"" of New Guinea, along with the misty mountains (reminiscent of Herzog's ""Aguirre"") are beautiful (obviously, with Nestor Almendros' cinematography). I enjoyed the ethnographic imagery and of rites and dances of the natives. For someone interested in them, this film is worth a look.3 of 5 Amazon stars. I take 1/2 off for the DVD transfer. It is, nevertheless, an interesting view, but many will probably be bored by some overlong scenes. The movie could truly have been better with 30 or so minutes trimmed.",N/A

When the two of them eventually go out on their first date, she gets really sick, and he stays the night and takes care of her. This blows her away and she is sold. The relationship is full steam ahead, but the problem is that it's wintertime and baseball season hasn't gotten started yet. She doesn't know what she is in for.Naturally, the Red Sox get in the way. Lindsey tries to be a good sport about it and even tries to learn the game and the two of them actually start going to games together and she becomes a fan as well. But things get out of hand when the team gets closer and closer to the playoffs and thats when problems arise.""Fever Pitch"" is cute, sweet, and has some funny moments. Jimmy Fallon is well cast and Drew Barrymoore isn't as annoying as she normally is.

804262,"The dreamiest and most oblique of Robert Altman's '70s classics (granting that IMAGES and QUINTET cannot plausibly be deemed ""classics""), 3 WOMEN is a compellingly weird bit of self-indulgence from the deepest recesses of Altman's brain.  In fact the director has revealed that the genesis of this movie was an actual dream he had, and it shows in the movie's atmospheric visuals, deliberate pacing and aura of mystery.  Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA also seems to be an influence, as this film encroaches on similar territory of two women living together whose identities seem to merge in ambiguous ways.  The pairing of Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall, two of the most unique and odd female presences in '70s cinema, contributes to the offbeat personality of this ""only-in-the-70s"" American art film.  I wouldn't call it one of Altman's best, but it's a fascinating artifact of a period where such compellingly weird bits of self-indulgence were financed and released by the major Hollywood studios.",3 Women

983613,"When a stranger calls is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. . .until the end. The movie is about Jill, a high school student who takes a baby sting job somewhere in the middle of nowhere in a really big house which is, needless to say, a very bad idea. At first it is the easiest thing in the world. The fridge is stocked, there are plenty of movies, and the kids are all asleep. But than she starts getting dozens, and I do mean dozens, of calls from just about everyone she knows. But than she gets a call from a deranged sicko who wants to kill her for some reason. Don't ask me why, he just does. She starts to freak out and calls the police who send a police car but it will be 20 minutes until it arrives. But then she gets a call from the police who tell her the killer is inside the house. That is where the scares begin. Every dark hallway becomes a hiding place for the killer. Ironically the minute the killer actually shows up, the movie stops being scary and starts being nothing but an old fashioned slasher flick without the blood. He has lost the only thing he had going for him, his stealth. The more we see of him, the less he scares us.",N/A
805912,"Well, having finally seen PETER PAN yesterday I can say that I have no ideawhat people are talking about when they refer to the ""sexuality"" in thefilm. I just did not see it.On the other hand, I can see why the film is not doing well at the BoxOffice. It wasn't really good.  While it was certainly more successful thanHOOK and there were parts of it I liked (the final Hook/Pan battle, Petertrying to close the window), the film as a whole did not succeed.I honsetly don't understand why this film is being touted as being more""faithful"" to Barrie's work than other versions.  Certainly the PETER PANmusical videos (Mary Martin and Cathy Rigby and even the long lost MiaFarrow) are FAR more faithful to Barrie's original play, as most of thedialogue in these videos is right out of Barrie's play.  This version wasabout 40% faithful --which in my eyes puts the Disney cartoon (at about 60%faithful) as being more faithful than this one.Some of my problems with the film:1. Tink --I hated her.  I mean HATED her in this version.  Not Tink thecharacter but the way she was portrayed.  I think they were aiming for herto be the equivelance of one of those stupid ""comic animal"" characters thatshow up in almost every Disney cartoon of late (Quasimoto's little gargoylefriends).  They kept cutting to her mugging for comic relief --but shesimply was not funny.2.  The Lost Boys --they were marginalized here.  We never even learnedtheir names until the END of the movie. And what about Slightly's famousline explaining his name ""Slightly Soiled, that's my name"".  Not there!3. There was no segment of the film revealing the life in Neverland. As soonas they arrive the battle with Hook begins.  What about the Piratesfollowing the boys following the indians? What about Michael sleeping in hisbasket?  What about Wendy telling the boys the story of Hamlet? What abouthe Neverbird? Peter being stranded on Marooner's rock? The poison cake? Thehouse in the trees ?  Faithful to Barrie's original?  not even CLOSE!4.  As someone who has been in productions of PETER PAN since  I was 8, Iwas surprised that I found no emotional connection to this film.  Even theending was just BLAH! The whole movie seemed Blah! And I really wanted tolike this movie.5.  Sumpter was good --and his American accent was not as bothersome to meas I thought it would it be.6.  Wend y was very good too.  And I did not mind the ""courting"" of her byHook.  He did this in the play too, though in the play there was no questionthat Hook wanted Wendy to be HIS mother.  In the film you weren't too surewhat he wanted.7.  The score was very HARRY POTTER --especially at the beginning.Well the movie wasn't HORRIBLE but it was not a great film either.  I willbuy the DVD when it comes out and hope for lots of extras and  deletedscenes.  But  I will not be going back to see this film in a movie theater.BTW --the people in the theater with me (about 20 altogether) were not thatthrilled with the film either.  When the Aunt ""adopts"" Slightly some girlsaid, rather loudly, ""This is so STUPID!""  And the kid in front of me wentfor large lengths of time NOT looking at the screen!

Great piece here and a joy to watch it over and over.The countdown is not perfect but way better than oh say the ""Top 50 Superstars"" one they did a while back. The addition of the entire Raw 1000 is nice as is the Legend of Wrestling roundtable discussion, which makes the blu-ray the way to go. However I admit the countdown is only worth watching once, the Raw 1000 episode has it's moments but isn't worth repeat viewing. The Roundtable part is very good, however even that doesn't push this set above being a 3-star effort at best by WWE.So while it's not a bad release, I agree with other reviewers it could've been a whole lot better, from the countdown to the extras. So I'm not saying don't get it, just don't spend a fortune to get it and don't set your expectations too high.",WWE: Raw 100 - The Top 100 Moments in Raw History

655455,"Let's get one thing straight from the get go.  The Simpsons is one of the most beloved TV shows in the world.  Let's also get another thing straight, the show has been around for nearly twenty years and has actually caused a divide among fans.  Those who believe the show is still good (or sometimes better than ever) and still has legs; and those who believe the show has been declining in quality for years.  I warn you of two things before you read on.  The first: I am one of the Simpsons fans who believes the show has been declining for years.  I still sit down and watch the show, but in all honesty, the last good season was probably season 10.  The second: Because of my stance, this review is heavily biased.  I love the Simpsons.  I've sat down and watched it since the first episode aired.  But sometimes even fans have to realize when their favorite show churns out something that doesn't live up to the standards of fans.  Perhaps its because I've been with the show since the beginning that it's easier to find fault with the newer episodes.Despite that, this movie will please people from both sides of the specturm.  Whether you think the show is is better than ever or you think it has declined in quality as I have, there's something here for you and it's partly because every writer who has ever been a part of The Simpsons chipped on.The movie begins in Springfield where Green Day is giving a concert at Lake Springfield.  Unfortunately the lake is so polluted that the stage Green Day is singing on (it's floating on the lake) that it eats away at the stage and it sinks taking Green Day with them.  This forces Lisa Simpson to hold a town meeting where she presents her lecture entitled ""An Irritating  Truth,"" (obviously a parody of Al Gore's documentary).  In addition, Homer and Bart have some fun (a moment so hilarious you'll miss out on some of the dialog because you'll be laughing too hard) which eventually lands them in Krusty Burger where Krusty is doing a shoot for a commercial.  When its over he orders the Pig be killed... and Homer can't let that happen.  So instead he saves the pig's life and takes him home.The citizens of Springfield agree to stop dumping trash in the lake.  Of course, there is one man who will dump something in there, of course... Homer Simpson.  When Marge asks him just Homer has been doing with the pig's ""leavings"" he shows her a silo aptly marked: Pig Crap.  Of course, Marge is disgusted and says that Homer still has to do something about it.  So what does Homer do?  Dumps it in Lake Springfield which causes a series of events that soon reach Washington D.C. and a corrupt politician. In the end, Springfield gets encased in a giant glass dome.  When they wonder why, they eventually find out that Homer is to blame.  Through strange circumstances the family manages to escape Springfield and go to Alaska where they no longer have to worry about Sprigfield's state.  What they find out later, of course, is that the corrupt politician (voiced brilliantly by Albert Brooks) plans to destroy Springfield.  Its up to The Simpsons to save the day.The movie is complete with all the humor you'd expect from the show itself.  Parodies, clever and witty dialog (there are some keepers here), physical abuse of Homer, Bart's shenanigans, Lisa's unpopularity... even the over the top zaniness that some from my side of the spectrum have come to loathe.  And of course, the movie pokes fun on a political and religious scale.  The whole plot of the movie is based around environmentalism and corrupt politicians while they also do their share to make fun of religion.  The Simpsons has never been shy about tackling controversial issues and this movie is no different.  Take some things too seriously and you'll surely be offended.Still, it's actually a very funny movie.  Especially the first twenty minutes.  There wasn't a single person in the theater not laughing at what was happening.  This movie is fun of memorable moments.  The infamous Spider-Pig is but one ingenious example.And then there are some bits of the movie that just fall flat.  This would be the humor that has been coming out within the past couple of seasons.  There are some parts that so over the top in stupidity that you'll either love them or hate them.  Homer's character is also unbalanced.  Homer has always been an oaf but at some moments he is unreasonably stupid.  At others he's not nearly as dumb.  In other words, the mesh of Classic Simpsons vs. Newer Simpsons is all too obvious in many areas.There are some other nit-picky things.  Some stories just aren't complete.  Lisa, for example meets a boy who she falls head over heels with, but the movie never completes this story arc.  Another nit-picky fan gripe is that a lot of the film just isn't in Springfield to begin with.  This means that while you see many of the residents, you don't spend much time.  Most of the Springfield denizens we've come to love (Principal Skinner, Mr. Burns, Chief Wiggum etc.) are on camera for mere seconds and hardly say or do anything.  It's almost like playing ""Where's Waldo"" only with The Simpsons cast.  It's not too big of a gripe, however.  With so many residents in Springfield you couldn't expect to see them all.  Just the same we don't really explore Springfield to begin with.  We don't go inside the school or the police station or anything.  Most of it is spent either at The Simpson's home or various places you've never seen in the show.But the biggest gripe?  That this is a Simpsons movie where Mr. Burns is not the main villain.  While watching this, I couldn't get over the fact that you only see Mr. Burns twice.  He's one of the most malicious characters in the show.  He's been involved in some of The Simpsons best lived moments, but here he doesn't even use his famous, ""Excellent"" phrase.  Not that the corrupt politician voiced by Brooks is bad, but it would've been far better had Mr. Burns been the main adversary.The final thing is that the movie is rather short and feels more like an extended episode rather than a full blown movie.  At 87 minutes it goes by in a flash.  And yet, despite which side you fall on: Classic vs. New, you yearn for the movie to be longer because regardless of anything, it's funny.  But it's also because you wish you could see more.It can't be easy to make a movie to a series that's been around for nearly two decades.  Especially with expectations so high.  The Simpsons Movie succeeded by having a successful run at the box office.  However, if you're from my side of the woods: Meaning you love the classic Simpsons episodes a lot... there's something to be desired that isn't there.For what it's worth it IS a good movie.  It's just a movie that had so much potential to be so much better.",N/A

1246109,"There's sort of a stupidty meter with movies like this. There's smart funny, where the humor is good, well pointed, some kind of redeeming quality to them (Canadian Bacon,Wayne's World / Wayne's World 2, come to mind). Then there's the movies that are so bad, so offensive, that they are funny (Dude, Where's My Car?,National Lampoon's Van Wilder, for example). Then there's a whole bunch of movies in the middle, not hilarious, not stupid funny, but just kind of funny - well there's where we land with Fired Up. Middle of the road. There's funny moments, there's some pretty girls, and there's a funny plot.Two high school football players, who happen to be the school players, are tired of their prospects for chicks. They get the bright idea that cheerleader camp would be a place to score 300 new chicks, all in one place at one time. How cool is that? So they become cheerleaders and go to camp. They score. But really they fall in love with two cheerleaders, and they help the cheerleading squad out. And everyone lives happily ever after. It's that sweet.What's this unrated monkey business? The theatrical version was rated PG-13. Almost every bit of humor is related to sex in some way. So I have no idea how they dodged the R rating in theaters. At any rate, there is exactly one scene, the skinny dipping scene where a really gorgeous girl removes her swimsuit top (total time maybe 10 seconds), that puts this at R rating. Mind you it's a scene that should have been in the movie to start with, and there actually should have been many more of those kinds of scenes. Actually there's a fairly lame scene of two girls kissing, maybe the MPAA wouldn't have liked that. No there's no shower scenes, no raids in the middle of the night while the girls sleep...none of those things at all.Production wise - no idea why anyone would really care? It's very poorly shot. The editing is not good. The surround sound - virtually absent or the soundstage was totally flat and lifeless. There is absolutely nothing here that a television hack crew couldn't have accomplished in their sleep. But none of that makes a difference, this is a silly summer movie.Acting - virtually everyone is an unknown, relatively new actor, or deep on the B/C acting list. It was a little hard for me to beleive that these two dunder heads were that hot and popular with the women. They are OK, they are reasonably funny, but they weren't these amazing guys. The girls are pretty, no question there, well worth watching. Jokes are well delivered and hit punch lines about right.The bonus features are super lame. No they are down right awful. That 8 minutes of the cast saying the f word, just plain old and dumb. Nothing funny there. That 12th hour of the publicity tour - that was so scripted and lame. The blonde guy going off, totally a scripted and badly acted moment. No skip them completely, no reason to stop there. I think there are about 100 trailers for other films.Not a strong recommendation. Not a stinker. You know who you are that will enjoy this.",Fired Up!
474265,"A typical, atheist, New York woman is just going about her life, ""liking being me,"" when suddenly she starts having seizures... and after the fits wakes up to find wounds on her that match the wounds received by Christ.  An investigative priest comes to figure out what's happening, and the two set out to discover what's happening, ultimately uncovering a big Vatican conspiracy.The movie has a lot going for it, especially with an untypical character receiving the stigmata and the great cast it has built up (Patricia Arquette and Jonathan Pryce especially).  It also has Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins doing the score, but that apparent benefit is also one of the film's minor failings...  A score should undertone and strengthen a film's drama, but this movie with its excessive (and repetitive) fast-paced editing, directorial fat, and overfocus on the music makes it seem much more like an hour and a half long music video.That's cool if you're wanting a music video.  However, I don't imagine many people approach this film from this direction.  I would have prefered more focus on the rest of the craft of the movie, but that's just me.It's also slightly predictable in that not-good-predictable way.  There's one scene that seems kind of excessive but is foreshadowed earlier, though that doesn't mean it was necessary.  Overall the film just got too caught up with being some visual/musicy slamfest to slow down and think about what it was trying to do.--PolarisDiB",Stigmata VHS

407382,"Hellraiser IV: BloodlineAs my subject line of my review states. Being a huge fan of I and II - I've looked upon later movies in the franchise with a leery eye. Too much of good thing spoils the flesh.Pleasingly, this one isn't a hour and 20 some minutes wasted. The story at times is engaging and demands your attention. As in many of my reviews, I'll avoid the already reviewed ground of the plot and offer my insights.The opening scenes of ""Hellraiser in Space"" at first, I almost turned the movie off. But then, something said give it a chance so off I went.  I'm generally not a fan of flashback sequences. This one however was well done. The flashbacks provided pivotal backstory as to the events of 2127 and what lead to events on the space station.I agree with the statements that the Merchant men should've been played by different actors. One face spanning the generations. Don't buy it. Different cast actors would've made it more believable.Using seduction instead of pain in competing Demon styles was interesting. Although Pinhead gets the last line and laugh there. He was on target with terror vs. seduction.My favorite scene when the one black man's skin on his face is completely torn off. Just gorgeously gorey. It was quick and brutal. Pinhead wasn't in the mood for a long play session. ;)Overall the story holds my interest. However, with the removal of Pinhead which largely *is* the franchise these days. It becomes much weaker.Thats where my criticism comes in. I've never been able to get past in II when Pinhead gets killed.  The good doctor reduces him to a mortal, then offs him. I know he comes back in the end of II with the rotating column - translation sequel.  However, after Pinhead's and the Cenobytes deaths in that film. That left an impression of finality.To resurrect Pinhead for go around after go around. Its turned the Hellraiser franchise into too much of a good thing. It lost its special touch I and II had.As a sequel its worth checking out if you enjoyed I and II. Just rent it first.",Hellraiser: Bloodline VHS

600746,"In the end, there's somethign about this film that works. Ford and Neeson are surpringly good, and seem to have a chemistry that is at times perfectly tense. I'd even go so far to say that for the most part, Ford was acting so well I began to hate his character...which of course is his intent. That's saying a lot since I have a hard time buying him as a bad guy (What Lies Beneath was just abysmal). There is, of course, the hullabaloo about the accents. Are they bad? Yes. Ford's is at times too underdone, and at times way over the top. Neeson's is basically absent, and we get more Irish dialect than anything else. I get the feeling they needed a better voice coach...if they even used one. BUT! I found myself getting over it all after about fifteen minutes and following the story instead. It starts slow, but if you hang in there for about a half hour, the tension surfaces, and once it does it rarely lets up. There's genuine emotion and struggle when the reactor springs it leak, and the crew must enter the radiation filled room to fix it. It's just plain depressing and disturbing, and I completely identified wth the blistering men who suffered the effects. I bought Ford's concern over his crew while at the same time struggling with his allegiance to his homeland. I bought Neeson's love for his crew and disgust with Ford's reckless ways.  I routed for the men to escape...Russian men at that, who chose to moon the American Destoryer that was offering them assistance.  Naturally, there are some stretches that make you yawn, and there are some moments where you'll question the  truth of this supposedly True Story. The only major thing that annoyed me was the Hollywood-ized ending. It was unecessary and boring.",N/A
1540457,"The worst of the 3 is Blaze. A sad vehicle for the aging actor, Paul Newman. It is billed as a comedy. it is not, even, mildly amusing. A real waste of time. Dumb.

The acting, through out, is good and the story is OK.. I give this movie 3 1/2 stars. Just a little bit better than OK.The best of the 3 is Nixon. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Nixon. He really captured him. The movie plays, somewhat, as a documentary..I think there was an element of editorial in the story, but it, basically, played true.

784893,"It could have been so much better.  Good special effects, a quite decent concept, good actors, good sets and backgrounds, in general a great feeling to the movie, but the plot suffered a little.  My main complaint was that of charater development, especialy regarding the 2 leads whom were supposed to have some sort of emotional attachment/connection.  The problem was that they never spent enough time, or dialog, together to develop the bonds that were needed by the end to explaine the things.  She was supposed to fall head-over heels for him, give up all she was raised to belive, etc, etc, etc, (don't want to ruin too much if you haven't seen it yet), yet I think she spent more screen time walking though doorways (entrances and exits) than she did with the other romantic lead.  Don't get me wrong, I like Kate Beckinsale in tight leather walking away from the camra as much as the next guy, and I look forward to timming things out when I get the DVD, its just with a little better editing and the addition of a scene or two this movie could have been one of the better ones, and deffinatly would have gottne another star.",N/A

Carell, who has--thank goodness-- never been as far over the top and annoying as Jim Carrey, plays things fairly realistically. His agent 86 is immensely likable.  Hathaway, while lacking some of the ooomph of Barbara Feldon, is believable as Agent 99 and charming without being sex-potted up.  Dwayne Johnson presents a nice performance and, as usual, the under utilize Alan Arkin and Terence Stamp are admirable for what they bring to the table.  I think if your expectations of this are low, you'll likely end up enjoying far more than you'd think.  If you're expecting something that is a direct copy of the original, you'll likely disappointed.  Still, from the opening credits to the last frame, despite its many flaws, this movie manages to capture the spirit of the original and serves as a decent homage.",Get Smart
16988,"Zorro, the hero of Pulps, movies, books, comics and television, has a new movie out.  Antonio Banderas, on Larry King Live, mentioned that he hoped this movie would help to keep alive the spirit of the only Spanish super-hero (he in not the only one nor was he at the time of the interview).  Well, I think it will do much to keep the name alive but not the spirit.Anthony Hopkins is Zorro, the Fox.  After years of struggle, Spain is pulling out of California and leaving it to the Mexicans.  But Zorro slips up and the evil Governor tracks him down, kills his wife, steals his daughter and throws him in prison.  Twenty years later Don Diego (Zorro) hears that the Governor is back.  Minutes later he has escaped from prison (what was he waiting for?) and is destined to run into Antonio Banderas.  After their meeting, Don Diego trains Antonio to be the new Zorro.  The rest of the movie involves the plan to create the Independent Republic of California by buying it from Santa Ana with gold dug out of its soil and stamped to look Spanish.  Mexico is willing to make the sale because of their war with the United States (it is now 1841).If you are looking for a fun swashbuckling adventure, then this is definitely the movie to see.  If, however, you want to see Zorro, you might find yourself a little disappointed.  Gone is Zorro, the defender of the common people and the innocent.  In his place is, not one, but two, Zorro's who are bent on personal vendetta's and enlightened self-interest.  It is actually Don Diego's daughter who helps some enslaved Mexicans near the end of the movie.The transition from one Zorro to another takes the Fox out of the wealthy and privileged and makes him a commoner.  The new Zorro is also a thief (in a wonderfully fun scene the young Zorro steals his horse, a very serious crime at the time).  Having Zorro break so common a law seemed wrong to me.  To have Zorro flaunt the breaking of laws meant to worsen the lives of the commoners is another thing entirely.  But in this movie Zorro does not taunt authority.  He plots against it, to be sure, but for his own reasons and not for the good of the people.As this movie has two Zorros, there are now also two villains to be defeated (one each).  The elder Zorro still has his old nemesis to contend with while the younger Zorro has made a personal enemy of Captain Love, a young Cavalry officer who seems to be in the wrong country.  Both villains are vile and easy to hate.  This make the personal vendettas a little more palatable as well as making the ending a lot more fun.The other main problem with this film is that Zorro loses.  Zorro never loses.  but in this film Zorro loses big time.  He loses his wife, his home, his daughter, his name and twenty years of his life.  Granted, he briefly regains his daughter but gone is the hero who can laugh in the face of danger and triumph brilliantly.The last thing I wanted to mention is that, probably due to the controversy over the new Jeffrey Irons film, Zorro is no longer married to his wife Lolita.  Her name has been changed (how dare they) to the more common Esperanza.  I can understand the concern of some but Don Diego won the heart of Lolita before the Roaring Twenties.  As in the Nabakov novel, Lolita is a valid name before it was turned into an adjective.  Next thing you know people are going to try and get Disney to change the name of Bambi because they think it is a girl's name (Bambi was the prince of the forest).So, if you want to see The Mask of Zorro because, to you, it means an exciting swashbuckling movie, you will really enjoy this one.  But if you want to see the movie to watch the continuing adventures of a hero that has entertained all generations since his debut almost eighty years ago, part of you will be disappointed in what has happened to the character.",N/A
1138848,"""Vantage Point"" was directed by Pete Travis and written by Barry Levy. The attempted assassination of the President of the United States is told from several different points of view until all the pieces come together. Members of the cast include Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, Matthew Fox, William Hurt, Edgar Ramirez, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver.In this ensemble piece, the editing and pacing of the movie was very strong. The car chase scene was one of the better ones I've seen, it was very exciting and engaging. Some of the twists and turns in the plot were very predictable but others were pretty enjoyable. Part of the fun of watching this movie is trying to solve it before they come out and tell you what happened. It almost reminded me of the first few episodes of ""Lost"" where each character's perspective of where they were and what they were doing when the plane crashed ending with something suspenseful. Eventually it all converges on the same city block.On the flip side of that, I think too many perspectives were used. Usually about three is a good number to go with in telling different versions of a story, beyond that it gets a little cluttered and unorganized. At the fourth time, I was like, ""Really? We're going back to 11:59am AGAIN?"" Despite all that, it only has a 90 minute running time because the back story on characters is very brief and given through conversations so it all mostly converges on the assassination attempt and aftermath.Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana are very underutilized in this film. They show up in the beginning to show the newscasters' perspective of the events with Saldana as a reporter trying to throw her own commentary on the event along with the news and Weaver shutting her down as the editor. This leads into Quaid's back story of his Secret Service Agent career with Matthew Fox.Forest Whitaker plays a tourist watching the whole slew of events through his camcorder and he veers between awestruck delight at his surroundings to distressed terror and determination for some reason to run down the bad guys and try to capture all the evidence he can with his camera. Granted, he does capture many relevant moments in footage, but the average tourist of his size risking his life is pretty surprising since he isn't an off-duty Jack Bauer or anything. William Hurt's performance as the President is very brief (like many performances in the film) and he mostly fiddles with paperwork and rides in cars.Matthew Fox's performance was the most predictable with no surprises whatsoever. He plays the same stubborn guy he plays in ""Lost"" but as a Secret Service Agent instead of a surgeon. I would be so relieved if Jack on ""Lost"" somehow got offed in this last season. I could care less who Kate chooses, I think the biggest surprise would be if she chose Claire instead of Jack or Sawyer.All in all, this is an exciting thriller with very short performances and maybe a few too many versions to the story, but edited together very well.",Vantage Point
1423672,"Sure, all of us played the game, Ghost, when we were kids.  Most of us, however, didn't take it as far as the chuckleheads in this movie did.  Shallowness of main characters aside, Forget Me Not is still an interesting take on the traditional ghost game.  It is also a body count and revenge flick all rolled into one narrative.  Without throwing in that annoying spoiler, you will also experience an inversion of the traditional protagonist-antagonist motif, as well as varying degrees of altering reality.  All in all, this is a pretty impressive accomplishment for a supposedly B-grade movie.  And now for a quick word on our scary ghosts who were scary, because they didn't appear on the screen for too long a period of time.  Pale and indistinct from the sheer brevity of sight, they hearken back to the childhood time when boogiemen really did seem to exist out of the corner of your eye and you almost always just-but not quite-caught one moving towards you.  In the spirit of this, the most time your mind will ever have to take in one of movie ghosts is one, maybe two seconds.  Is it a perfect movie?  Oh-ho, no.  The acting is never above quasi-believable and the writers obviously spend about as much time creating these believable characters and the film itself did inside the movie theater, if it ever even got that far to begin with.  Love the movie for the suspense it tries to evoke and for the plausible ending that at least resolves the story on a convincing note.",N/A

So, of course, just like I did with *Fantastic Four*, I had to check out this film.I was actually disappointed in *Iron Man*, giving it a grade of C.Tony Stark heads out to the Middle East to demonstrate his newest weapons.  However, he's kidnapped and ordered to develop a new weapon for the terrorists.  Stark and a fellow prisoner develop a weapon but specifically designed for Stark to escape from the terrorists.After escaping, Stark puts all of his efforts to perfecting his armored suit.  When done, Stark, as Iron Man, returns to the Middle East to tie up loose ends.  However, it's not over for Iron Man as he soon discovers that there's someone within his company that is out to destroy him.*Iron Man* spent too much time on the terrorist angle and on Stark's perfecting work on the armored suit.  So, we get to see little action and abilities of Iron Man.  I do get it that this is the first movie and it takes time to develop the story of how Iron Man came to be.  However, if you spend too much time on the background, you risk losing your viewers' interest.  I went with friends, which we are diehard Marvel fans, but found ourselves fidgeting with boredom within minutes and suffered til the end.Again, was disappointed with *Iron Man*.  Sure do hope that the sequel(s) will be way better as seen in the *Fantastic Four* movies.",N/A

1073855,"I loved the Tick when it originally aired, and went on to enjoy the comics as well. Season two contains some of my favorite Tick episodes, and it is great to finally see them on DVD.If you love satire, screwball humor, or hilarious moral messages, you'll love the tick. This show kept spot on faithful to the Tick of the comics and brought him into an animated world that a character like him could really thrive in. This is entertainment great for kids and adults alike. I doubt you will be disappointed with the show itself.The DVD however is another story in itself. Why they keep cutting out episodes is beyond me. The Mole Men episode from season one wasn't too much of a loss, but will hopefully be on an upcoming DVD. This season really lost a great one though. ""Alone Together"" is one of the best Tick episodes that aired, and it is completely missing from this collection. My only hope is that this episode, and possibly the mole man episode make it on to the Season Three DVD. This all is kind of strange to me. The UK seasonal DVD's contained all of the episodes. In fact, there is actually a three disk boxed set you can get on Amazon UK if you can play region 2 DVDs.These DVD's also seem to be lacking any sort of feature. The story of how the Tick came to get published is certainly interesting enough to warrant, at the very least, a five minute featurette.

1480657,"Total Recall(released Aug/12)stars Colin Farrell as Douglas ""Doug"" Quaid/Carl Hauser,Kate Beckinsale as Lori, Jessica Biel as Melina,Bryan Cranston as Chancellor Vilos Cohaagen,Bokeem Woodbine as Harry,Bill Nighy as Matthias Lair,John Cho as Bob McC and others.As a ""reviewer"",one will come upon films,specifically remakes(alarmingly on the increase in today's Hollywood),and have different expectations than an ""original"" film.One of the basic tenets of a reviewer is to be objective,but being the human beings that we are,that isn't always 100% possible,ALL of the time.Prejudices do creep in whether personal or otherwise.I have to admit beforehand that I really liked the original,so when I watched this film for the first time today I was telling the film mentally""Show me what you can do...convince me"".So with that bit off my chest,let's see what the story is all about.It is in an Earth future,with a Blade Runner-ish look,where wars at the end of the 21st century have almost completely devastated the entire planet.There are two countries left,the UFB(United federation of Britain) and the Colony(Australia).The UFB imports alot of its workforce from the Colony and they come and go daily by the ""Fall"".This huge cylindrical device carries thousands of passengers from one country to the other,through the middle of the Earth.Farrell lives with Beckinsale,and is stuck in a dead end job.He keeps having recurring dreams about being captured by police forces while a female accomplice escapes.One day he heads over to Rekall,a place where they can implant new memories of anything a client desires.Farrell picks being a secret agent.Just before they start the process they realize Farrell has already a secret agent implant and they stop it.Just then the police burst in and Farrell,acting on unknown instincts,takes the entire six man team out.Farrell escapes and returns home only to have Beckinsale turn against him and pursue him through the city,trying to kill him.It seems she was a police plant,pretending to be his wife and that he was at one time working for chancellor Cohagen.The trick Farrell now has is to survive and find out exactly who he is and what they wanted of him.There are many trails for him to go through,but he eventually meets up with the woman from his dreams who is actually working for the resistance(Biel).Along the way Farrell finds equipment of his and his old apartment where the pieces start to come together.Farrell it seems was working for the chancellor initially but changed sides when he became aware of the chancellor's agenda to raze the Colony and build a new one.He was recaptured and re-programed by the chancellor but now that he has regained his memory he must try and stop the chancellor's plans from coming to fruition,with Biels help.He meets up with the resistance leader,but soon after the police arrive and take down the leader.Farrell and Biel are recaptured,with the chancellor ordering that Farrell's mind be wiped to its original self.Before they can do that Farrell escapes.The chancellor now puts into motion his plans of a Colony conquest and sends thousands of troops onto the Fall.Farrell follows the chancellor and Biel onto it.During the transport's journey Farrell plants explosives and manages to rescue Biel.At the other end the clamps holding the machine in place explode one by one,until it free falls and breaks apart in a huge explosion.After it all Farrell is in an ambulance and he wakes up to find Biel there,but it is really Beckinsale in disguise.He dispatches her and the real Biel and he are reunited.This new version of the film doesn't leave Earth,as did the first one to Mars.The strife is all here instead of on another planet.There are a few nods to the original as when Farrell says he had always wanted to go to Mars.There is also a check out through security onto the Fall,which mimics the security check when arriving on Mars in the original.It also has a woman checking ahead of a disguised Farrell.For those who recall the original,we are tricked into thinking that Farrell is really the woman,but it is a red herring.Overall I found I just could not get too involved with Farrell and company.There just wasn't enough oomph there,not enough spark to really pull me in.The acting that was tepid and couldn't ""believe"" enough for it to work for me.I also was wondering,plot wise,why did the Colony not blow up the Fall's entry point at their end in order to kybosh the chancellors invasion plans? Bottom line,sad to say,it couldn't ""convince"" me.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include about three featurettes,commentary and a gag reel.All in all a disappointing remake of the original starring Colin Farrell.Farrell just does not have the acting chops to compete with Ahh-nold from the original,nor make us forget the original and focus on HIS efforts.Biel and others he spends most of his on screen time with,are also tepid.Beckinsale is the exception and Nighy does a good but short turn as the resistance leader,but it is all for naught.",N/A

822120,"&quot;Spartan&quot; is the eighth film written and directed by playwright David Mamet. It stars Val Kilmer as a elite secret agent with paramilitary training who does dirty work for various U.S. Government agencies. He goes by the name of Mr. Scott, but we're led to believe that's not his real name. When the President's daughter disappears from her college campus, apparently kidnapped, Mr. Scott is assigned to assist the Secret Service in finding her. They have only two days to find and retrieve Laura Newton (Kristen Bell) before the news media get ahold of the story. Scott tracks her down. A rescue mission is planned. But things aren't as they appear.&quot;Spartan&quot; is not an adrenaline-pumping thriller. It's more of a puzzle. It's filmed in a shadowy, brooding style. A surprising number of scenes take place at night. &quot;Spartan&quot; presents an extremely cynical view of politics and power, which might be interesting if the story made any sense. Not only does the story not make sense, the dialogue doesn't either. It's conspicuously unnatural and consistently nonsensical. I think Val Kilmer's timing is poor in a few places, but it's hard to tell, because the lines are cringe-inducing anyway. Derek Luke and Tia Texada give the most memorable performances as young rookie agents Curtis and Black. I'm giving &quot;Spartan&quot; three stars for the cinematography by Juan Ruiz Anchia. I like the way this film looks. But the writing is just plain bad.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by Val Kilmer and a theatrical trailer. Don't watch the trailer before the movie. It's full of spoilers. The audio commentary is interesting in spots but a little frustrating because it meanders and contains a lot of long pauses. Kilmer also frequently doesn't comment on the scene that he's looking at. It's very stream-of-consciousness. It gives more insight into Val Kilmer than into the film, so I would recommend it for his fans only.",N/A

At some point she comes to sympathize with the illegals, but the film really didn't drive that home until she gives a speech to a policeman.As far as a crime/drama/thriller I didn't feel too thrilled, perhaps because they wanted to take a realistic approach as the film was inspired by true events.

94657,"Batman Forever.  The first Batman movie that was not directed by Tim Burton, and did not feature Michael Keaton in the lead role.  Because of this, the tone of the movie is very different.  It is noticeably less dark than either of the two Burton films.  Batman Returns got a lot of parental backlash because it scared the crud out of many younger kids.  With this movie, Joel Schumacher tried to make a Batman movie that the kids could enjoy, while still appealing to adults.  The result is kind of a go-between between Burton's two previous movies and Batman and Robin.  This movie starts to revert back to the camp of the 60s television show, but they still put in some dark subplots, like Bruce re-living his parent's death, or Robin losing his family and wanting revenge.  Most fans will criticize this as the prelude to Batman and Robin, and the end of that Batman movie series, but I still think this movie has some qualities to it.The plot has a lot of things going on.  Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is introduced in the opening scene.  He wants revenge on Batman (it is never really explained why, does he blame Batman for his condition?) and he pursues this vendetta throughout the story.  The Riddler, played by Jim Carrey, is obsessed with mind control.  He invented some kind of box that beams television signals directly into the human brain.  He can then read people's minds, and extract information.  Bruce Wayne initially rejected his idea, and so Riddler harbors a grudge.  Batman, played by the bland, emotionless Val Kilmer, is reliving his parent's death in his dreams.  He is starting to doubt if he wants to continue to be Batman.  He is also starting to date Chase Meridian, played by Nicole Kidman, probably the only actor in this movie who knew what she was doing.  Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell, makes his first appearance onto the big screen.  His parents were killed by Two-Face, and he wants revenge.  Bruce takes him in when he has no place to go, and begins to guide him.  In my opinion the plot had too many subplots.  There just wasn't enough time to develop one individual character.Many of the motivations for these characters are either underexplained, or just plain silly.  For instance, it is never really revealed what Bruce's dream is about.  In the novelization, he remembers as a kid looking in his father's journal and reading that the reason his parents were murdered is because they were taking him to the movies.  He feels guilty about this, and understandably so.  In the actual movie, however, this is never revealed.  Bruce is talking to Nicole Kidman, and he is about to tell her.  Then they start making out.  This entire plot point is never mentioned again.  The Riddler, after having Bruce Wayne reject his idea, turns into a supervillian.  He goes completely insane and decides to kill his boss and steal everyone's mind.  Two-Face, whose back story is only revealed in a brief video clip, is way too silly.  He does his best worst Joker impersonation in my opinion, and is always jumping around laughing and cackling like a lunatic.  Harvey Dent is supposed to be one of the more tragic characters in the Batman universe, but here he's just a joke.  He doesn't really come across as evil.  Along those lines, I didn't care much for Jim Carrey's performance as the Riddler.  He's just playing his roles from The Mask and Ace Venturra all over again.  He, along with Two-Face, is far too silly to be viewed as a villain.  But I suppose it fit with what they were trying to do: make a lighter Batman movie that was mainly aimed at kids.Val Kilmer made an adequate Batman, I guess.  The problem was, he did his Batman growl throughout the entire movie, whether he had his mask on or off.  And he seemed bored with the role, like he was about to fall asleep.  Say what you want about George Clooney's performance, at least he seemed like he was having fun with the role.  One positive thing I have to talk about, which doesn't really reflect Kilmer's performance, is the action scenes.  The action scenes are much better this time around.  I know some of the scenes were cheesy, like the scene with the bank vault near the beginning, or the part where Batman drives the Batmobile up the side of the building.  But I mean the hand-to-hand stuff.  Of the three actors to play Batman in the 90s movie series, Val Kilmer is really the only one who can play an action hero.  In Michael Keaton's movies, the action scenes were not very good.  This was caused primarily by the fact that Michael Keaton is not much of an action hero.  There were other reasons, such as the restrictive batsuit (which was finally changed in this movie) or the fact that Tim Burton cannot direct action scenes very well (this isn't a knock on Burton.  He's a good director, action just isn't his genre).  But wheras Michael Keaton was kind of small and skinny, Val Kilmer was big and muscular, which you kind of need to be to beat up seven or eight guys by yourself.  The fight choreography was pretty good this time around.  People might say that I'm spending too much time focusing on the action scenes, when there is more to the movie than that.  But seriously, Batman is supposed to be one of the best martial artists in the world.  In Burton's movies, I could have beaten that Batman in a fight.  Don't get me wrong, as far as performances go, Kilmer's performance is not equal to Keaton's.  But with all the mistakes this movie made, it's good to know they at least did this one small detail better.The character people usually tend to regard as the low point of the film is Robin.  Because of these movies, many people to this day cannot stand Robin, and regard him as a worthless character.  That is simply not true.  Chris O'Donnel is not playing Dick Grayson, he's playing Jason Todd, the second Robin.  Jason was a whiny cry-baby, who got so intolerably annoying that they killed off his character.  Dick Grayson is not supposed to be this big of an annoyance.  He's supposed to be an interesting character, and kind of a foil for Batman.  Robin was originally created because the writers of the Batman comics were worried that Batman was becoming too dark.  So they created a young character to be youthful and lighthearted and brighten up the story.  That could have worked very well for what they were trying to do with this movie, make a Batman movie that more kids could enjoy.  Robin is supposed to be a very likeable character, and instead we got someone who rivals Anakin Skywalker as the insufferable protagonist.Whining about his dead family, lording it over Bruce after he saved his life, and ordering Bruce to train him to be his partner.  Many people say they hate Robin in general, simply because of these movies.  If that is you, I ask you to reevaluate your opinion of Robin.  He is a pretty interesting character, they just messed him up here.In conclusion, this is a very average film.  It is considered a bad movie, because many people misunderstand it.  It is kind of silly and campy, but they wanted to make it a movie for kids to enjoy.  They really tried to find a balance between being dark and creepy and being silly and cheesy.  In my opinion, they did a pretty good job, for what they were trying to do.  It wasn't like the following movie where they went completely insane and did the most outlandish things they could think of.  The most important question to ask yourself when watching a movie like this is ""was I entertained?""  And yes, I was entertained.

It still has the action and large-horn helmeted Vikings to enchant the child that remains in a person of those times. But the film also seems to indicate that its intent was also part of a message in favor of the blacklisting and witch hunts of those times, as it repeatedly makes reference to Christians against heathens. At the same time, such battles were going on in Europe around the time of King Arthur, certainly they were a part of the literature of the times of early Arthurian legend.

192252,"Well, I rented this movie expecting a horror show.  What I got was a movie  that was more intruiging than scary.  I wasn't scared at all, in fact, but  some of the deeper plot elements kept me watching until the end.I did  not like the fact that most of the shots of the grotesque Van Daans were so  brief you did not get much of a look at them, but from a scientific  person's point of view, it kept you wondering about how this could have  happened to a family.The only part that made me sick was Jon Strauss's  having to eat...that fetus that had been soaking in formaldehyde for 75  years.  *That* was going beyond the good--or bad--tastes of any horror  film.  Horror film cannibalism is one thing, but this was overstepping  bounds.On the other hand, the element that interested me most, and  dissapointed me because it wasn't really resolved that well, was Kathleen's  baby.  It's a Van Daan.  Was it a boy or a girl?  Born with the horribly  mutated gene's of it's father?  Would it have to come back to the abandoned  island one day if it displays the symptoms of Jon's blood disease?I wish  that factor had been addressed more, but if they ever make a sequal--and  this I doubt, it was a B-movie--I would hope it would be this child coming  back, whether for medical reasons or simply to explore his/her twisted  roots.Now *that* would make an interesting movie element.",N/A
839252,"There are things about this movie that I really liked, and things that I really hated.  First let me say that when I first heard the movie was being directed by Stephen Sommers, I was really excited.  The 1999 Universal movie ""The Mummy"" was absolutely fantastic.  It stayed true to the original classic, but added in awesome special effects and a lot of humor.  I think that was a truly epic monster movie, it's sequel not falling far behind in terms of greatness.Anyhow, now we come to ""Van Helsing"".  When the official website for the movie opened, I couldn't have been more pleased.  The shadowy pictures of each of the 3 monsters had me jumping out of my seat, they looked so awesome.  Being a huge fan of the classic Universal Monster movies, I was happy someone had finally decided to do a decent remake of the three monsters featured in this film.  Most of the 90's versions of Frankenstein, Dracula, and The Wolf Man (with the exception of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", which was excellent) were really lacking.  Then finally when the trailer was released for Van Helsing, it was looking better than ever.And after many months of waiting, I finally sat down in a theater to watch Van Helsing.  I was greatly disappointed.  First of all, this movie did not stay true to the original movies at all.  It actually rewrote the birth of Frankenstein.  Sure, many of the same elements existed (the castle, an angry mob, the windmill, etc.), but the story was just wrong.  Dracula was never meant to be present at the Frankensteins' Monster's birth, and Dr. Frankenstein was meant to be a mad scientist, not some symbol of good.Next we come to Van Helsing himself.  Who exactly is the person portrayed in the movie?  He's obviously not Abraham Van Helsing, as portrayed in Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", but some descendant.  And why does he have to be working for the church, which only comes into play for about five minutes of the movie anyhow?  And quite frankly I don't see why Mr. Hyde had to be stuck in the movie either.  The Mr. Hyde in this movie was a complete rip off of the one in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"".  I personally, would have chosen a different monster, maybe the Gill Man or something more common in the classic Universal realm.  Anyway, I didn't particularly like Hugh Jackman as the hero either.  Don't get me wrong, Hugh Jackman is an awesome actor, but he's already Wolverine in ""X-Men"", and seeing as this movie is obviously some type of superhero story, I think they should have went with someone less popular.  And the whole ""right hand of God"" theme was really lame.Next we come to The Wolf Man (my favorite monster).  First, I'm glad someone was finally able to make a decent werewolf movie, as the past few years have not seen many, but I do have some complaints.  I think the ""first"" werewolf to appear in the movie, the one to bite Velkan, was the best one featured.  The gray fur, and the overly large fangs looked magnificent.  And the way the creature moved was great.  But the Velkan werewolf wasn't as good, in my opinion.  It looks too much like a puppy, not nearly as feirce as the first werewolf.  Yeah, I know, it's one of the good guys who has turned into the wolf, but still it could be a little meaner.  I didn't care for the transformation sequence either.  The idea of a man tearing off his skin and revealing a wolf underneath is awesome, but its was carried out too PG-13 friendly in the movie.  You need to show the guy actually tearing his flesh away, not blend the shedding skin with the metamorphosis.  And I don't really understand the fact that when the werewolf turns back into Velkan, it also tears its skin off.  The whole idea kind of contradicts itself.  And finally, and I don't want to give away too much, but the ""final"" werewolf in the film was mean looking too, but it's fur was too dark, and it made the creature hard to make out.  Not to mention the monster's face resembles that of a black lab.Finally we come to Dracula.  I don't think the character was carried out too well, honestly.  Dracula is meant to be evil and at the same time partially compassionate for his love, not funny.  It's good to have humor, but did Imhotep make jokes in ""The Mummy""?  And I also didn't care too much for the fact that Van Helsing encountered Dracula before, and the whole ""offspring"" idea was a cheaply thought out excuse to bring the monsters together.One last comment, what was the point of that Transylvanian guy with the top hat?  He had really lame jokes, and basically no purpose to the plot whatsoever.  I was glad to see him taken out by Velkan.  On the other hand, I think Kevin J. O'Connor added a great deal to the movie as ""Igor"", just as he did to ""The Mummy"".  He would have been satisfactory as the film's comic relief, but for some reason they had to make Dracula ""funny"", and add that goofy Carl guy for additional humor (a waste.)So finally, the special effects were excellent, and overall the movie is very entertaining, but I just think too much money was wasted on the project.  If they wanted to remake these monsters so bad, they should have done each one seperately, and if they wanted to make a movie with these three monsters so bad, they should have done it a little more seriously, and stayed true to the original stories.  Van Helsing is basically just a seriously overproduced mix between ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Howling VI"".",N/A

284183,"Charles Laughton's ""The Night of the Hunter"" is one of the most notable atmospheric films ever made. One wonders what other works may have followed had Laughton decided to further pursue a career in directing. The dream-like visuals he employed in ""The Night of the Hunter"" were groundbreaking, beautiful, haunting, and breathtaking all at the same time.Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) arrives in a small town one day with the letters H-A-T-E and L-O-V-E tattooed on his knuckles. Powell has learned of $10,000 in hidden money which was stolen by a man who used to live in the town. Seeking out the man's widow, Willa Harper (Shelley Winters), Powell hopes to find the hidden money and keep it for himself. The widow's two children, John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) know the location of the money but refuse to tell the mysterious preacher where it is. So begins a cat-and-mouse game between Powell and the children.Laughton was ahead of his time in making such effective use of visual imagery. The shadows and lighting he employed added deeper layers of meaning to the proceedings. Especially noteworthy are the moments in the bedroom set and the shot depicting Willa Harper's final fate - both scenes still astonish to this day. When the children drift down the river while escaping from Powell, the wonder and darkness of nature is filmed in so graceful, mysterious, and absorbing a manner that one is reminded of the techniques of modern-day directors Terrence Malick and Tim Burton. Mitchum is amazing in what is easily the best performance of his carreer. Child actors Chapin and Bruce are also great as is Winters in a tragic role. The inclusion of screen legend Lillian Gish in the second half of the film is only icing on the cake for an already impressive production.",Night of the Hunter VHS

Here they remake an old Peter Sellers movie 'After the Fox.' Tees Maar Khan is a master criminal who is going to pull off a huge heist. To do so he poses as a film director who will shoot his next masterpiece in a small village and use the villagers in the film and unwittingly in the heist.This is a comedy but the Indian sense of comedy isn't the same as ours so it just doesn't generate many laughs. Their facial expressions and physical movements are all over-exaggerated. Pretty much like something you'd see from Jerry Lewis in the 60s. Those days are long and gratefully gone.The cast is OK. Katrina Kaif is stunningly beautiful as the female lead. Akshay Kumar is so-so as the male lead. He has a decent screen presence but I found nothing particularly appealing about him.

1451462,"I wanted to like this movie, I really, really did. The cast was great, the provenance hallowed...... but - the movie was alternately confusing, dull and baffling. The idea of presenting the life of Margaret Thatcher through the use of flashbacks from an old, and dementia afflicted Mrs. Thatcher must have been an exciting concept. However, the reality was confusing, boring and difficult to follow.There is a far better version of the life of Margaret Thatcher, another unique approach to the life of Margaret Thatcher, but one that works: ""The Rise and Fall of Margaret Thatcher"". This is a sterling BBC production, using 3 actresses ( Andrea Riseborough, Patricia Hodge, Lindsay Duncan) to portray a very accurate representation of Mrs.Thatcher's life. I would highly recommend this 2 disc set to anyone wishing to learn more about Mrs. Thatcher and her times.Meryl Streep tried her best, all of the actors gave it their best, but -""The Iron Lady"" just did not pull it off. The flashback sequences representing the life of an aged Mrs. Thatcher and a young Mrs. Thatcher, at the height of her power, just did not work. Denis Thatcher was presented as more of a clown and buffoon in his many appearances in the hallucinations of the old Mrs. Thatcher. I felt cheated by the lack of an accurate historical representation of the ""Thatcher Era"". The movie seemed to demean Mrs. Thatcher, love her or hate her... she was a very interesting politician. She served during some very historic times in Britain, none of that is accurately presented in this film. I am not and was not a fan of Mrs. Thatcher, but she was a very interesting person.

I just want to talk about a few things.I generally like this movie.  It's a good story, spooky, suspenseful, dark, and gloomy.  I think the best thing this movie has going for it is the atmosphere.  There is seemingly a never-ending overcast sky for the entire movie.  I think this creates a consistent spooky atmosphere.  The other thing this movie has going for it is that it's scary and suspenseful most of the time.  Naomi Watts?  She's perfect in her role.  Another thing - the music by Hans Zimmer is highly effective and fits in with what is on the screen.  This music is not overpowering.  Instead, it's very low volume, subtle, and delicate.One thing that just jumped out at me was that this movie borrowed from The Omen (1976 & 2006) and The Changeling (1980).  Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.

I am assuming the ""Like a Virgin"" scene was a joke, and, although I now find it hilarious, the first time I saw the movie I was so confused as to whether the director was joking and trying to make the audience laugh, or if he was in earnest ...  I would have just given this movie two stars, but for one reason.  The remake or ""Roxanne"" was so poinient and so well done I would buy the movie just for that.",N/A

1623201,"This disc is really odd. I am halfway through it. And man, does it have issues.First, it is a documentary about ranching on the Hungarian Plains. If it wasn't for the horseback riders wearing Hungarian Costumes, I would have sworn this was filmed in the Texas Panhandle or Oklahoma - almost the exact same landscape, similar flora and fonna, even similar architecture. Horses are horses, goats are goats, and longhorn cows are longhorn cows no matter where they are. There are even some shots that look amazingly like a field of Bluebonnets and firewheels, although the film does tell what the flowers are.There is not a lot of varrience in landscape, either. It looks like the guy who shot the video had a friend who owned some land in Hungry, and asked if he could shoot out there. It seems like an awfully small sampling of an area to title it ""Europe's Most Beautiful Places"". And while I am sure it is pretty low landfall, there is obviously more rainfall there than any other ""desert"" I have ever seenThe narration is attrocious (sp?). It felt like I was back in school watching a horrible 1950s educational film. She will put you to sleep. Luckily a Music only track is provided.The disc specifications say English / German Audio tracks, but all I saw was English and a music only track.The video.... Okay, so let's start out by saying that the 3D effect is AMAZING! Stuff really pops out of the screen. One of the best looking uses of 3D I have ever seen.Tis the FIRST 3D release that I have ever seen that...... HAS GHOSTING BAKED INTO THE VIDEO!!! However, it's not the only visual issue.Pretty much, it looks like the entire show was filmed with a Pro-sumer grade 3D HD camera, and an older model at that. It seems that there are quite a few interpolated frames. While this looks fine on static landscapes, the video starts to blur a bit on pans. However, when horses are running across the picture, or sheep, goats or cows are in motion, not only does the picture blur and soften, but there are some very obvious ghosting effects. Pausing on a frame of, say, a horse running, will show what looks to be 2 or three frames composited on top of each other, with your current frame being the sharpest, and what looks like the before frame and the after frame which are semi-transparent. As you can see the horses legs in three very different points of motion, and not what you would expect - a left and right image speration issue, this leads me to believe that the issue stems from a camera that is not shooting a full 24 /25 / 30 frames a second and is in fact interpolating footage. As most of the shots are fairly static, though, this issue only rears its ugly head every now and then.There was something else that was really bugging me - just how soft the picture was during camera pans and action scenes. Turns out that the film has a bitrate between 9-13Mbps (the 13 gets hit in high motion scenes)... for a 3D TITLE! Who the heck encodes a movie that tight? The movie is only 53 minutes long, and there are no extras or subtitles, so why such a tight bitrate? The entire disc is just 11.5 gig.If this was released by a major studio, I would be screaming for a replacement disc.That being said, it's NOT awful. Like I said, the 3D IS INCREDIBLE, and there are some beautiful shots in here. And the disc is fairly priced at $10.",World's Nature 3D: Europe's Most Beautiful Places

Mr. Bean is very funny to me but everything is funny to this audience. There's not more than a few seconds between roaring laughter. The volume of the audience is also so loud that it dominates each show and becomes the focal point.

617084,"The so called 'Rednecks' must either be very good sports, or don't go to movies much, or both! If Hollywood is to be believed, over and over..and over again, they are the last people on earth you want to invite over for dinner or the very least avoid at all costs being stranded in their backyard. Mostly they are portrayed as not very smart, with a dislike to anyone whose warts are not visible, have a dentistry phobia, and who take the phrase' family ties' too closely to heart.But perhaps the film that should have made any decent 'Redneck' run to his local PR firm  fast was of course John Boorman's Deliverance. Their world was painted as beautiful but harsh and dangerous, and in a way as alien as any rock on Mars to the clean, educated, smart, rich and successful folks from the East or West, who just happen either to be lost or enjoying a holiday without the hassle of wanting anyone around.Many films have followed suit, and it became a sort of good material for any producer who wishes to add a bit of horror and suspense to his/her movie, from the crazy creoles in Southern Comfort, the loopy family with a taste for 'meat' in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the nasty kidnappers in Breakdown, the psycho trucker in JoyRide to the newest of the lot, Wrong Turn.Four young and beautiful people take, er..quite predictably a wrong turn, and end up lost in the woods at the mercy of three crazed mutated psychos (due to generations of inbreeding so we are to believe).The film itself is not bad, in a sort of ' bland and not adding anything to its genre' way. There is suspense and gore for the enthusiasts ,and the ubiquitous final scene that has been milked to excess in every horror movie post Carrie, the resurrection of the monster/killer for one final assault!!What works for the film is its length, and at 80 minutes it finishes just at a time when your fingers itch for the fast forward.The acting was mixed though: Buffy's Eliza Dushku and Six Feet Under's Jeremy Sisto do a decent job, while the lovely Emmaneulle Chriqui 's distress and tears are as convincing as those of a TV Evangelist.My three stars though are for the WAY OVER THE TOP the make up people made the three psychos to look like.I mean generations of inbreeding will have one greeting his hand every morning, but these guys's ancestors seemed to have bred with moles! They really look like extras fresh from the Lord of the Rings!!Anyway,I thought it would be nice to watch a movie one day about a group of 'Rednecks' being stranded in some big city and chased block after block by some insurance salesmen!!This will make a fresh twist, but I guess not good movie material..So Wrong Turn is an average horror film that I am sure will not disappoint many, but remains in my opinion, one that you can only watch once if you have nothing better to do, and certainly not 'movie library' material.",N/A

798993,"The two sequels to THE MATRIX have the same problem.  Sure, they are pretty much equally entertaining, but only the sum of some parts.  The WACHOWSKI's spent too much time in smokey rooms worrying about the phiosophical aspects of their project, and didn't realize the best parts of the original MATRIX were the FX heavy action sequences.  Hey, I'm as critical of plotting and story importance as anyone, but the draw of these B sci-fi flicks is the mayhem.  The battle for ZION is the best thing here, the special effects are simply amazing.  The story is weak.  What actually transpires at the end and why is very up-in-the-air, and seems rather rushed.  Although visually superior to almost anything out there, THE MATRIX series goes out with a dud, fully due to weak story.  Here's MY philosophy; why not make a film with an excellent sci-fi adventure story AND wicked FX?

1678660,"Laverne & Shirley was one of the most popular sitcoms of the late 1970s/early 1980s. Created by Hollywood icon Garry Marshall (who had his hand in a dozen other popular primetime shows), the show featured two single gals (future A League of Their Own director Penny Marshall, and American Graffiti's Cindy Williams) working at a Milwaukee brewery capping bottles while struggling with being roommates, their love lives, and any other shenanigans the writers could throw their way. The show was a spin-off of Marshall's uber-successful Happy Days; Laverne and Shirley came from the same fictional background as Henry Winkler's The Fonz, and with that a television classic was born.The seventh season of Laverne & Shirley may be seen as the season where the series finally 'jumped the shark' (a term ironically taken from a scene in Happy Days where the Fonz went waterskiing over some great white sharks); needing a fresh setting, the show uprooted the girls, as well as their friends and family, and plopped them down in the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. In my humble opinion, this proved to be a creative mistake. Clearly, I wasn't a huge fan of Season Seven. Although the actors do an admirable job of tackling the roles they'd perfected over six years, the writing never feels as fluid or finely tuned as it did during the show's initial seasons. It could be that because the Milwaukee location was such an integral part of the show, taking it to California feels like the writers were fitting a square peg into a round hole. It's also asking a lot of the audience to buy so many other characters would uproot their lives to follow Laverne and Shirley to Tinsel Town.If nothing else, this set is worth a look for the performances, which are the one thing that make it worth recommending. Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams are at their looniest playing off each other, skilled comediennes who are able to wring laughs out of just one withering look. Penny Marshall (the sister of creator Garry Marshall) has pitch perfect delivery, often getting a lot of mileage from her sad sack/hound dog expressions. Following them to California are Lenny and Squiggy, played perfectly by Best in Show's Michael McKean and Used Cars' David Lander. Both actors are a treat as two lovable, marble-mouthed grease balls always making life a bit too difficult for Laverne and Shirley.The episodes here range from decent to middling; often it feels like the writers are stretching to make the new setting really work for the characters. Many episodes feature typical sitcom silliness&#8212;in one episode (&#34;Ski Show&#34;) Laverne and Shirley take to the ski slopes in the hopes that they'll meet some eligible bachelors (wackiness ensues). Another episode features the girls getting into a squabble over breakfast cereal that ends with one of them getting a broken jaw (&#34;It Only Hurts When I Breathe&#34;). The one episode that did make me laugh more than usual featured Laverne being wooed by a suave married man who is forced to try and hide the fact that he has a wife by putting her inside of a fish tank (Laverne's reaction is priceless).Fans of the series will be happy that Paramount has finally issued the second-to-last season on DVD. They should cherish this DVD set because it would be the last time the two ladies would be featured together for a full season. By the third episode of the eighth season, co-star Cindy Williams became pregnant and unceremoniously left the show (igniting a legal battle with the studio), leaving Penny Marshall to carry the rest of the series herself. While the ratings were stronger than expected, Laverne & Shirley ended its network run in May of 1983. Considering the quality of this seventh season, it was probably a long overdue decision by Paramount.Laverne & Shirley: The Seventh Season is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 full frame in standard definition. The image quality for each of these 22 episodes is good considering this season is now well over thirty years old. Colors are evenly saturated and black levels sufficiently dark. While the image quality may not be revelatory, overall the series looks better than fans may have been expecting. The soundtrack is presented in Dolby 1.0 Mono in English. This is a very front heavy audio mix that doesn't feature much in the way of dynamic range or fidelity. Dialogue, music, and effects are all clearly recorded. Also included on this 3-disc set are English subtitles. There are no bonus features.Patrick Naugle, DVD VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",Laverne & Shirley: Season 7

1171497,"3.4 starsI loved the series, especially the running storyline with Smoking Man et al. I also enjoyed many of the stand-alone tales, into which this movie fits. But even in the extended cut I find this film to be barely as good as even the most mediocre old episodes.One of the best things about the series was its subtlety; it gave the viewer credit for intelligence, and rarely hit us over the head with gore or violence. But not here. The occasional gruesome scenes really distracted me from the main thing on display, the rekindling of the Mulder/Scully thang.[Spoilers] So M and S do some kissing, and are shown in bed, etc. Nice for those who waited for it, but for those of us who loved the show mainly for sharp dialogue and very crafty ideas, there's little of either here. The banter is ok but not up to snuff, and who needs to see all those hacked limbs and severed heads? Just doesn't feel like what I want from the X-Folks. Which is weird, as Carter and Spotnick did all of this. Maybe they thought they needed some sensationalism to sell tickets.Oh well, it ain't bad, and it has some strengths such as good production values, etc, but all in all I had hoped for a lot more, and a lot less.However, the blu-ray does have a fine set of extras, especially a history of the show with many many clips and a long, in-depth summary of every episode. It would take you many days to read and see all of that, so if you're a serious fan, you'll love that a lot, and the making-of/keeping it secret docs, commentaries, etc. It's a good package, and the film got a good transfer.If they make another movie, I hope they resurrect the old storyline, drop the blood and guts, and get on with what made the show great: quiet intelligence.",The X-Files TV Series

807535,"Without judging the vast amount of special features, I'm going to say that Wrestlemania XX was not all it was hyped up to be.  Many of the matches were truly great, and the return of the real Undertaker was momentous, but it fell short in that typical WWE way and somehow managed to botch one of their potentially stellar main events into a laughably simplistic match that could have easily taken place on a TV show without notice.United States ChampionshipThe Big Show (C) vs John CenaAny match that features John Cena is bound to be a dissapointment.  I think the ECW fans at One Night Stand 2006 flawlessly summed him up and there's no need to do much else here other than say he can't wrestle, and his gimmick is by far the worst thing WWE has ever done in recent years.  I would much rather have the Katie Vick storyline brought back than see Cena in the WWE, much less as a main eventer.  He is a bumbling failure in this match, and the Big Show is not much of a wrestler himself, but at least he has the stage presence to make himself truly felt.  John Cena's victory here made the whole match like trying to swallow a bitter pill and throwing it back up.  (0/10 and that's being generous)World Tag Team ChampionshipRob Van Dam and Booker T (C) vs Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak vs The Dudley Boyz vs La ResistanceWhoever devised this whole fatal four way tag, where only two men are in the ring, and any random person can randomly tag any other random person whether they're on their team or not, is an idiot.  Aside from the poor stipulations, the combatants were at their best and put on a great match.  (7/10)Chris Jericho vs ChristianThe storyline behind this match was, uncharacteristic for the WWE, a good one and believable.  Christian's already proven to me at Insurrextion 2003 that he's an astounding singles wrestler, and Jericho is great on his own.  They put on a superb match that really stands out in the night.  (8/10)Rock 'n Sock Connection vs EvolutionThis one was hyped up to a point of awkwardness.  The promo Randy Orton did with Batista and Ric Flair at his side was a complete fumbling that made me smack my forehead at how awkward it was.  The friendship in the ring between The Rock and Mick Foley is awkward as well.  Foley pretty much summed up the match in the extras post-match interview: ""It wasn't my best"".  We all quite saw it out there too.  (3/10)Evening Gown MatchSable and Torrie Wilson vs Jackie Gayda and Stacey KieblerWas there even a point in them getting dressed in gowns?  They just stripped down to their bra and panties before the match started and spent a good 3 or 4 minutes bouncing around Diva-style (ie, not wrestling) and showing the crowd their butts and crotches.  I can't even justify this with a rating.  It was not good.WWE Cruiserweight Championship Cruiserweight OpenChavo Guerrero (C) vs Rey Mysterio vs Jamie Noble vs Billy Kidman vs Ultimo Dragon vs Little Guido (I mean, Nunzio) vs Tajiri vs Funaki vs Shannon MooreI think this was perhaps one of the best matches of the night.  It wasn't long enough, but virtually everyone was high impact and at their best.  One by one, superstars would battle one-on-one battles, defeat their opponent, and another would come in.  The only disappointment was Chavo's ""cowardly heel"" ending.  (10/10)Goldberg vs Brock LesnarBoth men were about to leave the WWE, and I guess the fans knew it.  I had read that the fans abused both men, hated them both for leaving, and really tore into them.  I'm guessing whoever wrote that never saw an ECW match.  The fans really seemed confused here.  They cheered Goldberg as he entered, they didn't seem to know when to boo as Lesnar and Goldberg stood off in the ring.  Only once did they start singing that goodbye song to Lesnar, and they seemed really confused whether to cheer Goldberg or not.  The match was very low-impact, and it took a good five or six minutes for the two to start the fight.  A huge disappointment.  The fans were confused and dumb as ever, only cheering when Stone Cold Steve Austin gave the stunner to both men.  (0/10)WWE Tag Team ChampionshipRikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty (C) vs APA vs Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas vs The Basham BrothersAgain, the same stipulation as I mentioned in the previous tag team fatal four way.  Someone must have been drunk on the after-party wine already in this match, because Faarooq wasn't involved officially in the match at all, Bradshaw did very little, and all in all the match was very unimpressive from Shelton or Charlie or the APA.  It boiled down mostly to Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi vs The Basham Brothers vs Bradshaw.  The Bashams seemed to receive most of the attention from the bookers, and did the most in the ring.  (4/10)WWE Women's ChampionshipMolly Holly vs Victoria (C)The stipulation of this match stated that if Molly lost, she'd get her head shaved.  Guess what happened.  Yeah well like I have said many times before, if WWE refuses to let it's Women's division rise above mediocrity, they shouldn't populate their expensive PPVs with lousy women's matches! (0/10)WWE ChampionshipEddie Guerrero (C) vs Kurt AngleThis match was heavily built up with all sorts of emotion in the storyline and both men were given over 20 minutes to battle.  Compared to Guerrero's main event match the month before against Brock Lesnar, this one was mediocre.  This one could barely qualify as ""average"" on a regular Smackdown show.  As this was a Smackdown main event, and Smackdown is always the second-rate show, this one was done before the RAW event and even before the Undertaker and Kane match.  The only good part was Eddie Guerrero's unique way of screwing Kurt Angle by pretending his ankle was hurt, unlacing his boot, and when Angle comes at him with an ankle lock, Eddie slides out by yanking his foot out of his boot.  (4/10)The Undertaker vs KaneThis had been built up for months after the Undertaker was buried alive at Survivor Series 2003.  It's a good thing they buried that American Bad Ass biker gimmick, and brought back the REAL Undertaker---the Deadman.  Unfortunately, he still wears that stupid biker tanktop, and his Sara tattoo is very noticeable.  Kane is not the same Kane, but rather a fat bald idiot who is truly ugly and a poor wrestler.  At least Undertaker returns truly  (6/10)World Heavyweight ChampionshipChris Benoit vs Triple H (C) vs Shawn MichaelsI was expecting wonders from this match based on all the other reviews.  I was expecting some tour de force that WWE has been severely lacking.  I was severely disappointed by the hype.  Triple H barely does much, while Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels have some entertaining back-and-forth action, but mostly it boils down to brawling, with 70-80% of the match being made up of pillowstrikes and basic generic brawler moves like DDTs and Suplexes.  The only really amazing point in the match is where Michaels and Triple H doubleteam against Benoit and suplex him from atop the Spanish Announcer's Table onto the Smackdown Table.  Everything else hardly qualified as average.  Like the Smackdown main event, it qualifies as a ""good"" main event for the average RAW show.  (5.5/10)All in all, it was a decent Wrestlemania, but the failure of the main events and the lackluster events numbering more than two makes this three out of five stars, unfortunately.  Bad bad bad WWE.  For shame.",N/A

However, that being said, I was a bit disappointed that the story, in places, stretched my credibility. Yes, I know that sounds crazy, going to see a film about a guy that turns into a spider and I'm complaining about having my credibility stretched. But listen, if I'm going to accept a premise, say that it's possible that some guy could turn into a ?spider-man?, at least I want the story to stay in the borders its created and not push it even further.The acting was good, the love story well done enough for the genre and all in all I was entertained and enjoyed the movie, however, I'm still sticking with the same assessment that I gave the first movie, it's just an average adventure story with great special effects.",Spider-Man 2
153772,"First off I had heard the premise for this and thought it was enough to give it a blind buy. I ended up enjoying the movie for several reason, the clever script, Kurt Russel portraying a rather sneeky and more complex character, a pretty good job of portraying a future world that doesn't sound too outlandish, nice humor, good deaths and a nice ending.However there are a couple weaknesses the film posses. It felt like a slow movie, which isn't a good sign as the movie is actually pretty short. Dispite a good amount of stuff happening, the plot never felt like much was at stake. Kurt Russel was 24 hours to live during the movie and yet we keep forgeting that fact. It feels like the idea for this movie would work better as a film novalization rather than an actual film as we would get more from the characters and maybe have a different sense of tone (Then again I've only seen the film once).Finally like with other John Carpenter movies I've seen, they aren't bad at all, but I just can't like them as much as most say I should.

Otherwise it's right on target in many ways that are important.  I recently read The Diary of John Evelyn (a contemporary of Samuel Pepys) as well as some other books about well known figures from the 1600's in England.  I noticed some dialog in the movie that came straight from John Evelyn's Diary.  That was amusing, however the quote I'm thinking of is unprintable in an Amazon review, so I can't type it here, but I knew immediately what the source was when I heard it.  A lot of important things happened in Purcell's life (plague, the Great Fire of London), and many of those changes are noted in the movie.  We may not know a lot of biographical information about Henry Purcell, but this mini-history gives a pretty good outline of what was going on in his time.  Besides, he wrote some of the most gorgeous music ever, much of which you'll recognize even if you're not too familiar with his work.  So give the movie a try, forgive it its sins and enjoy the good parts, it's interesting.","England, My England - The Story of Henry Purcell"
611748,"I have often admired Rowan Atkinson in my living room. He has a riveting presence and is quite talented in the slapstick manner of a Charlie Chaplin. Unfortunately, the same magic is not evident when transferred onto the large theater screen. Atkinson does not suffice in the lead role of Johnny English. This James Bond spoof fails every time John Malkovich is not included in a scene. The latter actor portraying the laughably sinister French businessman, Pascal Sauvage, who wants to become King of England is hysterical and provides the right type of balance for this role. Natalie Imbruglia does a serviceable job as Lorna Campbell, the love interest of our not too bright secret agent.The scatological jokes were over the top and I personally could have done without these yucky attempts at humor. Also, Johnny English is far too slow paced and is about eight minutes too long. I can only give this film three stars. You might wish to wait until it is released in dvd format.",Johnny English
442046,"This film  is loosely based on the classic Dickens novel.  Very loosely.Set in modern times, it moves from the Florida Gulf Coast to New York with certain key elements familiar to readers of the original story.  There's a young boy who encounters a convict played by Robert DiNiro as a Mafioso. There's an eccentric old lady, played by a Anne Bancroft who wears brightly colored designer clothes, smokes cigarettes and guzzles martinis. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the icy young lady with cool detachment.  And Ethan Hawke is cast as the young man, a bit too much of a hunk for the role which is written to have him become the darling of the art world.There's a lot of star power here, and some nudity, but not much else.  The script does not do justice to Dickens' intentions.  We've come to expect good cinematography these days and so I must say that the Florida gulf coast really did look good.  What is lacking, however, is the dark brooding atmosphere.In some respects this is a pleasant video although it moves too slowly and never grabbed my emotions.  Gwyneth Paltrow does look pretty.  And Robert DiNiro gives an excellent performance.  But in a world where we can make choices about our entertainment, there's a lot better out there.

While his family unsuspectingly lives the good life in Surrey, George deals drugs and blackmails in London, supported by a crooked detective, Frank Dunston (played by John Benfield).  George and Frank inflict rough sex on Tom as rent, as well as create blackmail videotapes from Tom's tricking.  One day Tom resists, and George ends up dead.  Knowing that the police will be unsympathetic, Tom seeks help from some recent acquaintances, a neighboring couple from America (Max and Nikki Bergman, played by Corey Johnson and Toni Barry, respectively), who have just purchased a cottage in Wales.  When Tom convinces the couple to help him flee, the three drive to the cottage.  Crooked Frank has ways of finding things out, and the film moves to its climax.Although there was a variety of accents, attentive listeners should understand almost everything.  The outdoor scenes in Gwynedd (north-west Wales) were very beautiful (and didn't need commentary or orchestral swell to make the point).  There were many skin shots, mainly of Tom, a hottie.  The acting was good, especially by the bad guys.  Be warned that there is considerable violence shown in scenes of collecting money, interrogation, and in some sex scenes.  One interrogation scene involving a car and a barber chair is far-fetched but riveting.  The direction keeps the movie flowing at a brisk pace.The movie is ambiguous on a number of issues.  Was George's death really an accident?  Why were Max and Nikki so accommodating?  What was the real dynamic between Tom and Nikki?  Did Tom end up where he belonged?  There is a plot hole or two as well.  Viewers will interpret as they wish.The extras were the trailer to ""Endgame"" and to three other films.  There was no director's commentary, making-of, behind-the-scenes, photo gallery,  deleted scenes, or written list of chapter names.""Endgame"" gives the viewer a good look at a kept boy who fell in with a very wrong crowd and needs a change.  One can detect behind his coping defenses that he is cleverer than average.",N/A
1250073,For first time director Durst I will say it's an impressive feat to be able to direct a movie and have it come across as professional. Durst for sure has a talent in this area and I will be curious to see future work. Not a fan of the band however.Story wise this is a pretty meat and potatoes coming of age flick. I'd say if you have a chance to netflix it go for it but not really worth a purchase.,Education Of Charlie Banks
278635,"Frankly, all that saves this film from mediocrity is the stellar cast. Reginald Owen is faced with a part that has little character development, but manages to express a range of emotions and make the peripheral view of Scrooge which the script allows believeable. Gene Lockhart, as a sacked Bob Cratchitt who maintains a pleasant demeanour not to ruin Christmas for his family, does a superb job in a rather cartoonish version of the character - seeming to be the ultimate fun-loving, devoted father.The film certainly is suitable family fare. The magic of Victorian toys, circles of Blind Man's Buff at Fred's party, the laughing Cratchitt's at the table, and cinematography which capture a fictional but ""museum village"" view of ""Dickens London"" would be especially suited to children, since the dark side of the story is nearly entirely eliminated. There is nothing to trouble the very young, who indeed might find the Cratchitt home to be a place where they might care to visit.Yet the adaptation is a poor rendition for any lover of Dickens. Scrooge seems to be in self imposed loneliness, and insensitive towards his clerk, but (aside from the 'surplus population' line, which seems more a rebuff to charity collectors than an indication of Scrooge's miserly nature) there is no hint of, for example, Ignorance and Want and the tragedies arising from these. Most of the scenes from Dickens, when Scrooge is visited by any of the three spirits, have been eliminated. For example, in Christmas Present, none of the tragic, sordid plight of the poor is shown, nor is Scrooge's hardness of heart. We merely see him watch a party at Fred's (and beg the spirit to stay for the rest of the games), and want to hear Bob Cratchitt tell the rest of the story of Aladdin to his unusually happy family. Scrooge suddenly calls out that he 'loves Christmas,' and the effect is of one who did not know how to enjoy company rather than one whose heart is hardened with greed. Nor do the Christmas Past sequences, which are limited to his going home for Christmas with his sister and remembering Fezziwig's including him in Christmas dinner, include any of Scrooge's adult life.The plot has no depth, and characterisation is shallow. My impression was that it was intended to capture a mythical Christmas where all have fun and frolic. The only note of pathos is in the future, seeing the Cratchitts weep for Tiny Tim.It is a pleasant holiday diversion, good for nostalgia or for keeping the children occupied whilst one stuffs the turkey, but it bears little resemblance to Dickens.",Christmas Carol VHS
806727,"A Hero: a maiden fair; a castle; the ingenues - male and female; battles by sword, bow and arrow, fire; horses in their finery - ---- and ta-da! Time Travel!!The time travel is what fans of the book were looking for but to me was the least interesting part of an old-fashioned 'Errol Flynn' movie.  The buckles were swashing all over the place as we had sword fights.  We had castles under seige by fire, raining arrows, and catapulting balls of explosive fire.  We had the chaos of the final bridging of the walls and the two sides engaged in one on one combat.In the 'Flynn' part we had Gerard Butler, and he was a fine romantic lead.  Our fair lady was Anna Friel as Lady Claire.  Their sweet story is played out in way to short a time.The ingenues are Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor.  Attractive, but bland and banal.  Way too much of the film is watching them run here and there.Since this was based on a novel, I suppose they had to follow the time travel plot.  But the romantic 'Flynn' type swashbuckling story with the costumes, castles, horses  and scenery would have been a better film.  7/10",N/A

853418,"I really feel they should put a better title on this movie. It doesn't say anything about being set in modern times - but it most definitely is. Not only that, but it's set in Salt Lake City, Utah. It's a very funny movie, but it's not an actual adaptation of the book :)In this version, Elizabeth Bennett is a blonde writer going to school at BYU. Jane is her Argentinian roommate. Lydia, Kitty and Mary are all in the story too, retaining their general characteristics. The Bingleys are a rich pair who breeze into town, along of course with Darcy, who owns a publishing firm.There are parts of the movie that I love - and others that really bug me a lot. For example, Lydia and Kitty maliciously do various things to try to muscle in on Jane and Elizabeth's beaus. That's completely against the ""regular"" storyline, where the family was generally supportive and helpful. That's what made some of the scenes so poignant, that Lizzie loved her family dearly even as they embarassed her.On the other hand, though, when Mary is making a fool of herself musically, it's Lizzie who gets up on stage and rescues her, not the father. So they make an effort to show more of Lizzie's tender side. They also introduce Wickham right at the beginning, as a long term friend of Lizzie's. That strikes me better than having Lizzie start getting friendly with a guy her sisters are already interested in.There are no parents at all in this story - the kids are all on their own completely. Parents are, if anything, a nebulous ""expectation generator"" somewhere offstage. I really felt sad at that too, because the father and mother are such meaningful characters in the story. It's as if they made this story for teens who didn't want to deal with parents any more. In the original story, the parents, aunts and uncles all played important roles. In this one, not even Collins is related any more.Other changes were made that I didn't agree with. Collins publicly humiliates Elizabeth, which is *extremely* ungentlemanly and quite against his character. Darcy had nothing to do really with dragging Bingley away from Jane! Caroline explicitly lied to Elizabeth about being engaged to Darcy? They were changes that weren't necessary, and that turned characters into ""black"" or ""white"" - it lost a great deal of the gorgeous character depth in the story.On the other hand, there were several scenes where I laughed out loud. The little scene-titles that introduce sections of the story are often hilarious. There are a ton of subtle references to the original story. This can be a downfall, though. People who know the story well laugh right away at certain circumstances, understanding the meaning. If you hadn't read the book, you miss those items and the movie seems far more shallow because of it.A film for occasional watching, but not one to treasure like other versions of Price & Prejudice that exist.",N/A
358249,"This must surely be the strangest movie that Audrey Hepburn made, though it's not without its virtues. Directed by her-then husband, actor Mel Ferrer, the 1959 movie is a fanciful adventure story where Hepburn plays Rima, a nymph-like ""bird girl"" living in the remotest part of the Venezuelan jungle. She is being hunted by the local Indian tribesmen for being an evil spirit, but she is protected first by her grandfather Nuflo and then by Abel, a young political refugee whom she rescues after he is bitten by a deadly coral snake. The slowly-paced story initially focuses on Abel's hazardous journey into the jungle with Joseph Ruttenberg's cinematography nicely capturing the authentic Amazon locations.Rima shows up as a shadowy figure about a half-hour into the film and doesn't speak until about ten minutes later. Leave it to Hepburn to exhibit any sort of conviction in such an implausible role. Looking ethereal if a little too styled and coiffed (even without Givenchy) and sounding entirely too Euro-cosmopolitan, she still exudes Rima's innocence while discovering the darker secrets of her past. The rest of the cast is not as lucky. Anthony Perkins, a year away from ""Psycho"", is irritatingly unctuous as Abel when he is not simply confounded by his heroic role. His low point has to be the ridiculous scene when he sings a love song to Rima as he strums his guitar. And where exactly did the guitar come from?Familiar character actors show up in the oddest roles. Lee J. Cobb, heavily made up as a cross between Uncle Jesse Duke and Santa Claus, turns in yet another ham-fisted performance as Nuflo, and Henry Silva is cast as another exotic as the ultimately nefarious tribal leader. Nehemiah Persoff has a small bit at the beginning as a greedy trader, while Sessue Hayakawa, of all people, has a mostly silent role as the tribal leader. Adding to the artifice is the obvious use of soundstages and matte shots to replicate the jungle, and the ending is pure Hollywood sappiness. This is a curio for Hepburn fans.",Green Mansion VHS
62454,"`One True Thing' is a familiar piece of family tensions that erode relationships only to reveal stronger connections and everlasting bonds.  It is handled with manipulative casualness, which strips away some of the honesty and gives it the appearance of heavy handed falsities.  `One True Thing' tries so hard that it loses the `true' part of the equation.  The performances are strong, especially from Zellweger, who undergoes some serious emotional shifts throughout the film, and she handles them with ease (she would have made a far more inspired Oscar nominee, as opposed to the always great but often over-nominated Streep).  Hurt is his usual self (with so much promise in the 80's, he fell into predictable shtick) and Streep tugs heartstrings with calculated fervor.  The thing is, when all is said and done, this film isn't memorable.  It just isn't a great movie.  I agree that the police angle was a misstep, but it wasn't the most grievous.  The film's internal tone just needed to be lifted from the obvious.  It is too apparent what the film wants you to feel, even within the plot manipulations that should read as honest twists (like with regard to Hurt's character and his apparent lack of concern); they come across too weighted down by the filmmakers intentions.  Insert scene, project sadness, receive bounteous tears; that is the whole objective of this film and it works well on that front, but when I walked away from the film I forgot most of what I felt because it never felt `real'.",One True Thing VHS

I also thought the acting was suberb.I lower the rating by one because of the unneccesary placement of the F word from Beyonce's character (I can't stand movies that put it in there to make sure they get a PG13 rating) and another point because it was probably about 30 minutes too long and some of the characters weren't developed as much as they should, like Eddie Murphy's and the Dreamgirl that he was sleeping with.Overally good but not great.",N/A
1307970,"Piranha 3D is a remake of the 1978 original film Piranha which was itself a parody of the classic film Jaws. The film was made by French producer Alexandre Aja best known for his remake of The Hills Have Eyes. You might be asking yourself: now why would Piranhas come out of seemingly nowhere and kill people? The storyline provides the answer: 1) There is a lake under a lake in which Piranhas have survived by eating their own kind in order to survive in this prehistoric lake and when an earthquake hits the Piranhas break loose 2) This is a ""horror"" movie (I'd say it's more of a horror-comedy), it doesn't have to actually make sense in order to enjoy. This is a remake of a movie that was really a parody of Jaws, let's put it that way.I'd say a fun aspect of the film is how it's not that well-written but it makes for a fun B movie. One advantage the movie has is acting, except some characters that were rather goofy the acting in Piranha 3D is pretty good considering how this is a horror movie. The main characters especially were portrayed by good actors in which we actually do see a development to the point that we do care if they survive. The humor of the movie is similar to that of teen aimed movies such as American Pie and Sex Drive, not necessarily a bad thing unless you would consider that sort of humor juvenile. For instance about the humor, watching a penis eaten by piranhas with the 3D effect can only be funny or tasteless, you decide! Now the 3D effect worked very well to a certain degree I'm not sure how well it worked because I have not seen much 3D movies as of yet. Yet there were some pretty good effects and some good thrills resulted out of it. The Piranhas looked amazing and the death scenes (of which there are many) were done in an excellent gory way and looked like an actual death suffered due to Piranhas, it was convincing and not over-exaggerated like you might think it would be. A low point would be the ending as it's a big thrill but ends perhaps too suddenly and surprisingly (maybe a Piranha 3D 3 is in the works? Yes Dimension Films has announced that due to the success earned on the opening weekend by grossing over 10 millions there will be a sequel).Was I disappointed with Piranha? Not really as I knew what to expect (even though some things were unexpected) and knew what kind of movie I was going into. Should you expect high quality from this movie? The answer is no but you should expect to have some fun watching it, especially with friends. Who would I recommend Piranha 3D to? To those who are looking for a fun mindless movie on a boring night, it's entertaining to say the least. One thing is sure if you think the movie misses the target it achieved (whatever it is) it misses in an amusing way. 3 stars out of 5, flawed but fun in the way that you enjoy a good B movie.",N/A
1083117,"Three months before Shia LaBeouf's leading role in the Summer of 2007's blockbuster Transformers, he appeared in Disturbia. And he seems to have gotten into the same character for his roles in both films: a kind of missing link from Scooby Doo's gangScooby Doo, Where Are You! - The Complete First and Second Seasons.""Every killer lives next door to someone"" is the tagline on the movie poster, and the movie's trailer expands on the spoiler-tagline by coming right out with the detail of how a high school senior (LaBeouf) living under house-arrest discovers his neighbor is a serial killer. So all that's left untold for viewers in Disturbia is what LaBeeouf's character and friends do about it.Disturbia makes frequent attempts at humor, but most of the intended funny moments border on corny. The target audience of this movie clearly comes off as 13 - 24 year olds...the Scream crowdScream Trilogy - Boxed Set. But Disturbia is far from how well done the Scream films were done. Kids and young adults will find some of the humor in Disturbia amusing, but serious thriller fans will tire quickly of some of the campyness.There are some good, thrilling moments in Disturbia, but the suspense is lost in how predictable the movie is...especially after how much of the plot is deliberately given in advance to viewers that saw the trailer.Overall the movie was good, and the I-just-have-to-see-what-happens-next factor kept me interested enough to be entertained.

On the way, a van begins to play games with them--honking its horn, cutting in front of them and forcing them to drive slow. We sense this is going to be a crucial fear factor later on.But for the next 50 minutes, we watch the photographed antics of the group as they have a birthday party, they sit around and get drunk. The next day they get lost in the snowy woods. Since it's not snowing, one wonders why they couldn't just follow their own footsteps back into the house.All this time we're waiting for SOMETHING to happen and it finally does--heralded by phone calls, a pounding on the front door, a package left on the steps, a videotape made by someone whose gotten into the house at night and filmed them asleep.when the creeper finally comes into the house, the girls all shriek and run upstairs and wait for the boys to protect them. I was surprised that these healthy, strong girls behaved so idiotically. Not only did they do nothing to protect themselves, they never even armed themselves with a butcher knife, a heavy vase, nothing.  They were like throwbacks to women characters in films of the past. They stood by weakly, offering no aide to their male protectors.The movie ends on a disturbing note. We have no idea what happened to the group. While the credits roll, we see curious scenes of a stalker in NYC, and another scene perhaps of the killer, while he watches several TV screens, including the footage he shot in the death house.I'm looking forward to more movies from this director.",Evil Things

I figured I had 2 of the same discs but realized the problem had to do with the pressing. Although each discs are labelled, coded and packaged as volume I and II, disc 1 contains the other disc's material and vice-versa. This problem should only affect the Canadian editions and will hopefully be fixed, as people buying only one out of the two volumes might not be particularly happy with their purchase!This comes in a clear Amaray-type case and the booklet has 8 pages, including 4 full pictures. The cover is designed to represent one half of a full picture and, as the result, the artwork for volume I is reversed. The DVD menus are very simple and feature the ONJ heart logo but no Olivia pictures, except for animated previews on the tracks selection pages. The cool thing is that on top of being able to play separate songs and the whole DVD, there's also a playlist feature, giving the option to view them in a different order.If you think all Olivia Newton-John related reviews should be 100% positive, please stop reading here.The digital transfer for this single-layer release is very average, at best, and overly compressed. In most cases, it's better than the ""20th Century Masters"" DVD but very grainy for the live songs, compared to the ""Olivia Live In Concert"" bootleg DVD from Korea. On the plus side, the audio sounds than on the tapes and the Korean bootleg.While the audio presents noticeable limitations due to the fact that it's only available in Dolby Digital 2.0, the worse part is the remastering. Instead of using the original audio tracks, they edited the actual album tracks. ""Landslide"" is the album version, instead of the video mix, and there are no crowd sounds present at the beginning or end of the bar scenes from certain of the ""Physical"" videos.Overall, it's great to finally have a lot (though not all) of Olivia Newton-John's videos on DVD but I feel they could've put more effort into it, quality-wise. Also, the live songs should've been released separately as the original ""Olivia In Concert"", since they're not actual videos and don't quite belong on this collection.

1126255,"A demon named Grendel rampages through the feasting hall of King Hrothgar and smashes grown men as if they were china dolls.  Hrothgar sends out a call for heroes to come and fight the demon and Beowulf shows up to accept the challenge.  He and his men spend the night in the hall and Beowulf ends up taking on the monster virtually single-handed.  Grendel's mother, also a demon, retaliates and Beowulf goes to confront her.  This is where the story begins to diverge significantly from the original epic as Beowulf is seduced by her beauty and promises of fame and fortune and then must deal with the consequences later in life.The strength of this movie lies in the voice acting.  Anthony Hopkins, Brendan Gleeson, and John Malkovich are particularly strong and well suited to their parts.  The greatest weakness to the film was the decision to use all CGI, even motion capturing all of the actors.  Many scenes looks cheap and fake, even though they would have been easy to do using sets and live action.  The characters have waxy faces and often move stiffly and jerkily, and often seem unnatural.  The story changes were apparently an attempt to make the tale more tragic and more personal but the wisdom was questionable.  This Beowulf is no longer a hero, just a fraud.This is not a great movie, but it isn't bad for someone looking for simple action fare.  As long as you can set aside the odd look of the CGI characters, the action scenes look pretty good.  This movie may be popular on DVD where fans can skip to the chapters that are more dynamic and skip the nonsensical attempts at drama between battles.",N/A
562745,"""Maximum Overdrive"" (1986) is what you would get if you crossed ""Duel"" with ""Night of the Living Dead"" and significantly amped up the parody component of each film (there is a little ""Temors"" here as well). Not exactly highbrow, it is considerably more entertaining than its rating score would indicate; especially if you can connect with the parody element.Written and directed by Stephen King on a very modest special effects budget, the story shifts between idyllic small-town and redneck truck stop somewhere in North Carolina. A UFO has somehow gained control over most machines (insert ""Metropolis"" here) which proceed to slaughter a considerable number of people.Neither the film nor King's original story seem to have anything profound to say about aliens, humans, or machines. That is probably for the best as deep philosophy would only get in the way of the entertainment value of this thing.Like the farm house in ""Night of the Living Dead"", those who remain alive take refuge in a nearby truck stop. Pat Hingle gives an over-the-top performance as the greedy owner who just happens to have a small arsenal of weapons concealed on the premises. Yeardley Smith as a stressed-out newlywed provides additional comic relief. Emilio Estavez and Laura Harrington provide the story's romantic element. Music is by King's favorite band AC/DC. Although everything from lawnmowers to blow dryers get into the act, most of the focus is on the eighteen-wheelers which besiege the truck stop around the clock.Then again, what do I know?

1621234,"The film opens up with Madsen narrating as to the cause of the infection: Deer, tics, birds, blood-borne pathogens, inevitable. Later we find out the infection is a mutant strain of Lyme's disease. We then get a quick scene that looks similar to the farmhouse attack in ""Night of the Living Dead"" followed by ""12 hours earlier.""The reason this film does that is because the build up is super slow. Louis Hartley (Michael Madsen) and Dr. Edward Dennehey (William Forsythe) are on vacation in cabins of the woods of Connecticut near East Lyme. They are there to bond with their sons... and get some hunting in. We get to meet wives, girlfriends, neighbors, some people in the woods, and the sick granny who bites the doctor (guess where this goes?)There are time consuming scenes of cooking venison steaks on an open flame and washing them down with the local Narragansett beer, topped off by drinking cognac from a screw top bottle (seriously?). The real action doesn't pick up until the film is half over. About 10 minutes from the end, the film is at a point I had wished it would have been 10 minutes from the beginning.This is not a zombie film per se. The infected people can talk, lie, and have periods of remission where they act normal. Severe symptoms vary from the time of infection. It doesn't take a head shot to kill the infected people as they are not undead.One would think a film with metal music, Madsen, and zombie like creatures would rate a full five stars, no questions asked.

'Hitch' is everything this movie is not. It is funny, fast paced, with great chemistry between actors, and a good leading male in Will Smith. 'Guess Who' however was incredibly predictable and slow moving at times. While there were a lot of ""funny"" parts in the movie, there was nothing in it that I laughed out loud at. The jokes were forced out for the most part, and the actors looked like they were going through the motions. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between the the leading male and female in this. At no point did I feel I was looking at real characters. I just felt I was seeing Bernie Mac playing the role of the father, and Ashton playing the 'boyfriend'. Ashton was silly while trying to be funny, which is his style and personality. But he was unconvincing and awkward while trying to be serious. Ashton is just in over his head with this kind of acting.In short, this is one I would suggest waiting to see on video.

543624,"Writer/director Kevin Smith's characters Jay and Silent Bob made their first appearance in 1994's cult favorite, ""Clerks"". They stood outside a convenience store. Ostensibly, they were selling pot, but, for the most part, they just hung out waiting for something to happen. They appeared in all of Smith movies over the next five years [""Mallrats"", Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma""]. Now comes ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", in which the pair must carry an entire movie, rather than playing minor roles. Because they are basically one big joke, the results are uneven. The scenes that work are some the funniest moments in recent movies. The rest, which are in the minority, are pretty painful. Whatever the scene, be forewarned that these guys remain consistently perverse and offensive.This is a road movie, and the plot is just an outline to which the various skits are attached. The movie starts off outside the very same convenience store where Jay and Silent Bob [Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith] were first seen in ""Clerks"".They learn that a movie studio is about to make a film based on ""Bluntman and Chronic"", a comic book. Jay and Bob were the inspiration for the comic, and they are furious that they are getting neither cash nor credit from the project. They decided to go to Hollywood to stop the movie production and to get revenge. Along the way, they become the unwitting pawns of a beautiful girl gang of jewel thieves. They're easy targets since both Jay and Silent Bob are complete morons.Whether or not you find the movie funny depends on a couple of things. One is an appreciation of Hollywood in-jokes.  Rarely has a movie been so full of them. The title itself is a reference to ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The original Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamil, have cameo appearances. So do lots of other actors, like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Smith executive produced the movie that made them famous, ""Good Will Hunting"". The girl gang is a parody of ""Charlie's Angels"". The movie references are so numerous that there are references to references. For some viewers, all this insider stuff will become exasperating. Others will love it, as they try to recognize as many as possible. I found it all to be fun yet completely self-indulgent, since, ultimately, it's all about how hip and knowledgeable Smith and his buddies are.The other thing required to enjoy this movie is a fondness for crude humor, or, perhaps in this case, a love of it. There is enough bathroom humor and profanity in the first twenty minutes to last some people a lifetime. I read that a certain four-letter word is used here 228 times, a figure I've no reason to doubt. Graphic sexual references abound, due mainly to Jay's complete obsession with the subject. Since many people are already familiar with Smith's characters, they won't be seeing or hearing anything unexpected. It's other people who need to be warned. This movie goes way beyond merely risqu&eacute;.It is only fair to point out that several groups have protested Jay's totally homophobia behavior. I doubt these attempts to censure Smith are necessary. He's a satirist. No group, be it women, blacks, Catholics, teenagers, old people or gays, escape his twisted humor. Even the stars playing themselves, such as Damon and Affleck, come off as ditzy fools. Smith himself laughs the criticism off, noting that everyone knows Jay and Silent Bob are idiots. At least we hope they do. On the other hand, aren't there always a few idiots in an audience?",Jay and Silent: Bob Strike Back

1208102,"""It's not the destination that matters. It's how you get there that counts.""Mark those words before you watch this one. A lot of surprises went down at the 2009 ROYAL RUMBLE PPV, and all of them worked. A couple titles changed hands, and many loyalties were tested. But even though I'm satisfied with where ROYAL RUMBLE 2009 has brought me, I didn't always enjoy the ride there.1) ECW ChampionshipMatt Hardy v. Jack Swagger (champion)---As expected, both men delivered a crisp opener to get us excited. Hardy has been a very reliable singles talent for quite a few years now, and Swagger's physical talents are well utilized. Amateur-style takedowns seem to be a trend in the WWE today, as Swagger often used some collegiate maneuvers to turn into suplexes. Matt Hardy's signature moves are becoming a little predictable now, but his resilience and timing are still crisp enough to keep us on the edge of our seats. All in all, this was my favorite of the four singles matches on tonight's card.""7.0 / 10""___________________________________________2) Women's ChampionshipMelina v. Beth Phoenix (champion)---This was one of the most unpredictable and unorthodox matches I've seen in quite some time. That's both a good thing and a bad thing with this match. There were quite a few moments when the ladies would pick up the pace, and their speed seemed to overcome their timing. Several slams and counters were off. However, the reason I overall liked this match was because there was some very strange offense from both women. Melina used kicks from every conceivable position to stay in the fight, while Phoenix implemented some very vicious power offense. There's a particularly savage leglock that you've got to see to believe. I think most will be able to sit through it, but I've seen these ladies do better against each other.""6.0 / 10""___________________________________________3) World Heavyweight ChampionshipJBL (w/ Shawn Michaels) v. John Cena (champion)---Pick a Cena/JBL match besides their ""I Quit"" Match a few years ago, and you've pretty much seen this one. This is getting ridiculous now, because JBL just pummels and torques Cena's body, yet the champ remains in the fight using only his signature moves. The only reason I'm not beating this one to death is because the angle with Shawn Michaels and JBL continues to be very good TV. It's a well-acted, well-constructed storyline that has kept me interested. Also, I will give credit to the match's interesting finish. However, the one-on-one match itself was average at best. I kinda enjoyed myself; then again, I was in a very comfy chair.""6.0 / 10""___________________________________________4) No Disqualifications - WWE ChampionshipJeff Hardy (champion) v. Edge (w/ Chavo Guerrero)---Vickie Guerrero came out and announced that there would be no rules for the title bout. And boy, I thought I had good reason to expect a knockout display of carnage. But then, Edge and Jeff started off with a relatively slower-paced contest. ""Okay,"" I thought to myself, ""This is a necessary way to begin, so that the weapons spots will mean more."" But quite frankly, this one just never gets off the ground. Not only is there very little ""No-DQ"" action, but also some of the more hardcore moments are dull. For example, there's a spot where Chavo Guerrero is lying on a table, and Jeff dives from a ladder onto him. That whole spot was ruined because Chavo was resting on the table after a few weak punches, just waiting for Jeff to crash on him. In fact, Chavo looked confused, because he'd cheat behind the referee's back in a No-DQ Match! The last 5 minutes include some nice counters and close calls. And as neat as the finish was, I don't think it'll hold up months from now. As it turns out, the ""No-DQ"" stipulation was good for the storyline, but didn't make the match any better. I was very disappointed with this display from these two gifted wrestlers.""6.5 / 10""___________________________________________5) 30-Man Royal Rumble---Anytime I watch a Royal Rumble on live PPV, I get a little exhausted when it's over. The suspense of the entrances, the close calls, the pile-up of wrestlers, and closing moments will always get me exhilarated on a first viewing. So I ask this: will the 2009 30-Man Rumble hold up on repeat viewings? The answer is, ""Yes"".First the good stuff:* The first half of this Rumble was non-stop excitement. The first 25 minutes has to be the most action-packed of any 30-Man Royal Rumble. There was so much going on that I couldn't keep up!* Seeing Rob Van Dam return to action was a genuine thrill. He entertained the Detroit crowd, got to show off some stuff, but also allowed the other wrestlers to do their jobs.* A lot of big names in this one. I knew who was going to win, but I kept second-guessing myself.  That's never a bad thing.* I've never seen so many near-eliminations in a Royal Rumble in my life. The number of times a superstar ALMOST touched the floor has to be a new record. Tons of suspense.* Randy Orton's victory celebration was perfect. He raised the hands of Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase for their assistance for getting him the win, and the final shots of Orton pointing to the WRESTLEMANIA 25 signs & pyro couldn't have been better timed. Orton knows how to use the camera to his advantage. Priceless!Okay, so what's not so good about the 2009 30-Man Royal Rumble?* The pileup became ridiculous. I think this Rumble featured the most superstars ever to be in the ring during a Rumble. This wouldn't have been an issue if the eliminations were more frequent.* Terrible way to use The Brian Kendrick. 15 seconds?! Just stupid!* The showdown between the final six competitors was good.  But as entertaining as it was, it was pretty obvious who was going to win. In hindsight, I should've paid more attention to how Orton was being talked about backstage.So, overall I think the 2009 30-Man Royal Rumble was on the verge of being the absolute best. The first half is non-stop excitement, and I challenge anybody to argue over that. But after a while, the match begins to drag, and gets pretty good in the final stretch. A very good 30-Man Royal Rumble. Not the best, but definitely one of my favorites.""7.5 / 10""___________________________________________ROYAL RUMBLE 2009 is a decent PPV. The biggest problem is that in every match, the finish overshadows the contest leading up to it. Matt Hardy and Jack Swagger delivered a solid match, but the camera lingered on Hardy afterwards, rather than pushing Swagger. Melina won the title in a very surprising fashion, but perhaps almost too surprising.Cena and JBL must stop working together, especially if you have Shawn Michaels at ringside. Let's face it: we knew he was going to get involved at some point. The whole time we're thinking about HBK, rather than Cena & JBL.Edge and Jeff Hardy have no excuse for their average display. I liked the betrayal finish as much as everyone else will, but considering how intense this storyline has gotten, the match was surprisingly soft.Thankfully, the 30-Man Royal Rumble is one of the better ones.  It drags a bit in the middle, and might be predictable by some people's standards.  But battle royals don't always entertain on repeat viewings; the 2009 30-Man Royal Rumble will stand the test of time.""It's not the destination that matters. It's how you get there that counts."" ROYAL RUMBLE 2009 does a good job setting up the months to come, but suffers as an individual chapter.",WWE: Royal Rumble 2009
1465377,"SAFE HOUSE is a movie looking for a story. It is a film that is packed with fine actors who've proved their chops many times, but here writer David Guggenheim has simply failed to give them a plausible, sensible story and all that is left after movie's end is confusion and a lot of smoke, fire, and debris and scratching of the head. Daniel Espinosa directs obtusely.Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a bored but in love CIA rookie whose tedious assignment it is to man a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa: he longs for a European assignment but his position on the CIA totem pole is far too low for anything other than where he is, according to his boss Dave Barlow (Brendan Gleason). Things change rather abruptly when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) the CIA's most wanted rogue agent is captured and taken to the safe house. The CIA suddenly sees Matt's position as key and his bosses (Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard et al) see that they finally have caught the dangerous rouge CIA Tobin Frost. In interrogation ensues but during Frost's interrogation, the safe house is overtaken by mercenaries who want Frost. Weston and Frost escape and must stay out of the gunmen's sight until they can get to another safe house. From there on it is chase scenes segueing into chase scenes and very little makes sense to the point that few in the audience will care what happens.Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington are always a delight to watch and even with this little bit of a mess of a movie they still make it watchable. The rest of the big name actors - Farmiga, Gleason, Shepard, Rub&eacute;n Blades, Robert Patrick, Liam Cunningham and Nora Arnezeder - are barely given enough lines to exist. But if you like action flicks, this one will likely please. Just keep expectations low. Grady Harp, June 12",N/A

639932,"I have noticed that the majority of reviews for this movie, whether positive or negative, tend to focus on whether or not they enjoy the actual story, and believe the things the movie deals with. Nearly every bad review is from someone bashing the story because of its ""conspiracy theories"". I'm going to right a review that's not based on that.The book is very good. The story is engaging, whether or not you believe it and are willing to just enjoy it as a story, and everything moves along at an exciting and thrilling pace. I thought that it would make a perfect movie, and I still believe it COULD.However, the movie was, in my opinion, a disaster. Although the plot follows very closely with the book, it's just not very fun to watch. Everything about it feels rushed, and it felt like they filmed it in two days. The pacing is terrible - the rushed feeling does not contribute to the ""thriller"" aspect of it, it just feels like they didn't care about making a good movie. The acting is also quite horrendous. Tom Hanks usually does a great job, but he was an awful choice for this movie. He is to old for the part, and did not feel genuine in his performance. The directing is below average. The effects are pretty decent. In fact, the only things that were well done.I'm rating the movie three stars because it did not feel like a TOTAL waste of time. It does compliment the book, but by itself it is simply not worth watching, especially for $20. While watching in theaters I was only intrigued by the story, as I had forgotten a lot since reading the book and it refreshed my memory. The ending was also a little better than the book in concept, but the bad acting and directing still applied.If you're interested in this film, please do yourself a favor and rent it first. If you like it enough, buy it. Otherwise, you could just read the book and hope that another version will be released in a few years that's done better.",N/A

Starting from markers and moving up to oil paints the drawings and paintings vary from straight forward sketches to his more well known cubist style. Best if watched in fast forward. You still get the point but in half the time. The cover painting is shot  in a ten minute span but actually took five hours for Picasso to paint. The cubist paintings are fascinating to watch as Picasso starts with a sketch and morphs it into cubism, seemingly adding and subtracting layers in a random fashion. Interesting but ultimatley boring. Most of the paintings are crap and this is coming from a huge Picasso fan.  It makes sense that all twenty paintings were destroyed after the filming.  A wonderful guide for a painter wanting to watch Picasso's creative process but possibly not very interesting to the casual viewer.",N/A

1055729,"The cinematography and CGI in Charlotte's Web is spot on. Somehow the filmmakers managed to maintain a dramatic, realistic look and feel, while still maintaining a childlike wonder of life on the farm. All the animals look completely realistic, even when they're talking, which is an accomplishment.The biggest drawback is that when they're talking, they're not always interesting. This similar problem has arisen in many animated films lately, and shows itself here as well: studios think that casting a name actor is the same as casting a character voice actor. It just doesn't always work. The name actors just sound like themselves, and don't put anything into their characters. The excepttion in this film is Steve Buscemi, who manages to create an enjoyable Templeton with an interesting voice. Robert Redford as a horse shines a little bit on occasion as does John Cleese as a sheep. The rest of the talent is borderline lifeless. Cedric the Entertainer and Oprah Winfrey as geese are forgettable, as are Reba McEntire and Kathy Bates as cows and Thomas Haden Church and Andre3000 as crows. The ultimate disappointment in the voice talent is Julia Roberts as Charlotte. She hardly puts any life into her voice, much less any characterization. While the other voice actors were merely forgettable, Roberts is a detriment to the film. Hopefully filmmakers will learn that name actors are not necessarily voice actors as well. They use their body to act, while cartoon actors just use their voice. It's a completely different talent.The film itself is entertaining and sweet; almost too sweet. The amount of mood music that plays to inspire you to start tearing up gets a little out of hand, but that's to be expected from such a family friendly film based on a classic book.Overall, this film is very pleasant relaxing experience, and if you have kids it's definitely worth checking out.

For serious fans of ""The Blob,"" the Criterion version is the only way to go and includes two separate audio commentaries from producer Jack Harris and director Irvin Yeaworth, among others. Also included is a photo stills gallery of collector Wes Shank's Blob collection, including the famous red silicone masquerading as a man-eating monster from outer space.For casual fans of the film, however, this version (from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks, distributed by Front Row Video) is serviceable enough with VHS-like viewing quality. The source material isn't terrible, but is certainly nowhere near as crisp and clean looking (and sounding) as the Criterion version. It is the full-length version, however, and is presented in full screen (pan &amp; scan). But that's all you get, there are no extras to be had, not even chapter breaks.

Then a little midnight caper, a little heist,  turns sour, a cop gets a little suspicious since there have been a ton of burglaries and robberies in the neighborhood and the guy goes crazy, and the cop winds up dead, very dead.Of course when a cop gets killed other cops are ready to work night and day 24/7/365 to bring the culprit to justice and it that process of bringing that stone-cold psycho killer to justice that drives this little film noir police procedural, He Walked By Night. They don't start with much to work with since our psycho was very smart, had a sophisticated scheme, and was very knowledgeable about what the cops were up to as they closed in on him. And that in the end was his undoing as some very ordinary back-filling police work leads to his identification.Funny as classically well done as this film is as a police procedural (getting the bad guys after all is what crime film noir is all about) it was not at all clear why our culprit turned on society and that failing takes away from each of the actions to try to corral him. So we will definitely have to put this in the B-film files although the scenes at the end when the cops corral our mad monk psycho are very evocative of other famous chase scenes (think The Third Man).",He Walked By Night VHS

But, for what it is, I must admit that I found much to enjoy with ""Alien vs. Predator.""Unpopular as that sentiment may be to the eyes and ears of Paul Anderson bashers worldwide, I stand by my word when I say this film delivered all the ingenius entertainment I could ever want. This viewpoint, you should understand, comes from somebody who never once played the video game Anderson based his film around. I am therefore unable to pick apart every last second of the movie the way so many others here have gone out of their way in doing already. I am, however, quite familiar with the individual ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" films that also inspired this much debated endeavor. And, it is for that sole reason that I consider myself worthy enough to offer my own fair and openminded analysis.First off, I think we can all pretty much agree that ""AVP"" is NOT a continuation of ""Alien"" or ""Predator."" Nor do I believe that Anderson intended it as such. The plot dynamics he has put in place clearly suggest that his script represents an entirely new mythology for both creatures. I think, for the most part, Anderson was attempting to kick-start a brand new franchise with this project. That belief falls into why I was able to appreciate his approach to the overall material. It was easier for me, with that knowledge, to avoid the temptation of comparing what I saw to the other films that came before. Aside from the plot holes everybody complains about, I give Anderson credit for adapting a fresh take on these time-worn monsters.All this notwithstanding, I do feel obligated to take issue with FOX for two-timing me, one of their many loyal consumers, with this blatant ""unrated"" Director's Cut. Yes, the two-disc package is very appealing. You get nine minutes of extra footage, digitally enhanced ""gore,"" and an admittedly cool ""Alien vs. Predator"" comic book! My main question would ultimately have to entail why this wasn't the DVD FOX initially released. Money may indeed make the world go around, as we've all been told. But, why do so many distributors feel the need to double-dip on certain titles? That makes no sense to me now and probably never will for as long as I live.But please don't let this minor quibble detract you from your decision to experience this film for yourself, especially if you've never seen it. Regardless of what you might have heard, this is not a totally unredeemable crud-fest. It is a suitably entertaining and altogether fun escape from reality. That is what I have always maintained movies of this nature should be about. I say give it a chance.",AVP: Alien vs. Predator
1571741,"Still trying to figure what is the point of the movie. If the point was to underline the huge potential of AnnaLynne McCord as an upcoming talent, then the movie was a complete success and deserves five stars. However, if the whole exercise was to highlight some kind of pseudo intellectual filmography or direction, or plot, then the movie is a total failure and deserves one star.The story is very simple. Pauline (AnnaLynne McCord) is a very emotionally disturbeb adolescent. She is going to high school with normal kids and we wonder why this kid is in a normal high school instead of an institution. She really speaks her thoughts freely in the morning (at breakfast) or at night (at dinner) with her family, or in school (during class) with her teachers. We follow the dreams of Pauline through the movie and we know that something really bad is coming. Not afraid to confront the high school bullies who are making fun of her. Her father is totally passive while her mother (Traci Lords) is uptight and nasty and only cares about her younger sister who has cystic fibrosis and is slowly dying. She is going to therapy with her priest because her parents are cheap and really don't think that there is anything wrong with her. Pauline is fascinated with science and wants to become a surgeon. Yeah right! Like this is going to happen with her attitude...We expect something major (bad) to happen and it indeed really happens.Malcolm McDowell gives a solid but not significant (as far as the movie plot) performance. I am not sure if Traci Lords was always a bad actrice (even in her previous career) or is just a bad performance in this film, but she is really not up to par in this movie. It is also a very short movie. It is only 81 min with titles rolling and everything. They could have developed the plot a lit bit more if they really wanted to. But I think they run out of blood... for the special effects.I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. It is not a good movie even for horror fans.

The Orb is a shining globe which when decoded will show the map of where Pandora's Box is hidden. Lara is enlisted by M16 to snatch back the Orb before it falls int o the wrong hands of the enemy who is intent on unleashing the evils withing Pandor'a Box. The adventure continues across the continents to China and then Africa.I enjoyed the first film but felt that this particular film lacked the excitment of the first.

259499,"Before I review Black Rain, let me tell you that I agree with some of the previous reviewers that the picture quality of this DVD (its better on VHS) is totally unacceptable.  When I first watched it, I had to check my cable connections to make sure they weren't at fault.  What a let-down.  Mr. Scott should be raising hell over this.With that said, this is one of my favorite action movies.  It portrays Detective Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) as an outgoing, old-school cop who takes moral short-cuts to get the job done.  His partner, a relatively new Detective (Andy Garcia) is along for the ride.  They have a run-in with a Japanese mobster (Yakuza) named Sato.  After arresting Sato for commiting two murders in a New York restaurant, the Detectives are ordered to escort him back to Japan to face charges there.  They manage to let Sato escape as he arrives in Japan.  A Japanese Detective (Ken Takarara) is assigned to help out the New York Detectives.Douglas, Garcia and Takarara are excellenty cast in their respective roles.  The screenplay is well written.  I must say that the cinematography is really good.  Japan, the once-conquered nation, is now an industrial powerhouse.  But, like the U.S., it suffers from the ills of corruption and violence.  Ridley Scott does a great job of showing the tension between the two cultures.  The Japanese, &quot;bound by duty and honor&quot;, and the Americans, loud and outspoken, are viewed as somewhat obnoxious by their counterparts. The musical score is incredible.  Hans Zimmer really brings this movie to life with an array of Japanese and American-themed music that injects just the right amount of tension for the corresponding scene.  Brilliantly done.This movie is 5-Star material, but the DVD version is a huge disapointment.  I would wait to see if a special edition DVD comes out (I can only hope) with the video quality this movie deserves.",Black Rain VHS
1327278,"Perhaps I read the write up on this wrong, but I was expecting more of a movie (like watching the &#34;Diary of Anne Frank&#34; or something - it's not.  It's a recollection of her, told mostly by her mother with some interview clips thrown in of others involved with her and a mixture of actual footage of events of the war, and &#34;faux&#34; footage (reinactment made to look like old footage).It is a surprising story to me in that she became such a huge, honored symbol (for lack of better words).  She was a Jewish girl from a well-to-do family in Budapest, Hungary.  She was a smart girl, well liked by her classmates as they elected her to office in school - however antisemitism had crept in to the school (where Jews had to pay 3x higher admission) and the school reheld the election to have a non-Jew elected. . . . This was the start of her &#34;wake-up call&#34; and her interest in school went downhill and her interest in moving to Palestine grew.  So, she got herself accepted to an agricultural school in Palestine.  hardly what you'd expect a smart and well-off girl to do, but she figured there were enough smart people - Palestine needed more workers.  A little odd, but...In Palestine, she was &#34;safe&#34; from the German war atrocities against the Jews, and as it turned out Budapest was still unoccupied - a final holdout for the Jews, but she saw the writing on the wall and knew she HAD to get her mother out, and anyone else she could -- now.  So she joined a group and trained to parachute into Hungary and they were going to start getting Jews out and strengthening resistance efforts, etc.  They arrived too late. They parachuted in days outside of Budapest and the Germans invaded within a few days of their landing. They were unable to do anything.She got caught before she could help even 1 person..  So in a sense, she didn't accomplish anything and you wonder why she ended up being so famous, so revered. ....  She had key information the Germans wanted and took her punishments instead of turning over the info.  Somehow within the prison where she was being held she became loved and revered, but this didn't really explain why to my satisfaction.  I guess she was a shining example of holding out a flicker of light to those who were desperately seeking one in the darkness of the times.....It was interesting, not at all what I expected... and while she seems to be someone to admire for her strength and courage, she did have an &#34;out&#34; -- she could've saved herself (so this show says) knowing that the city was being liberated and it was only a matter of a few days....  I didn't really understand why she chose to bravely go down at that point.  I think I missed something.  I'm thinking there were MANY people who were the strong flickers of light during those times, in many places --- how SHE in particular became so famous/special for it I still don't know.If you just love every chunk of info about the Jews and WWII and stuff, you might want to see this . . . but for me, it was interesting but I almost feel like I wasted my time on this.

441887,"I saw this as a memento to childhood delight, as I vividly recall seeing it with my best pal when it came out.  There are wonderful images in it, of the greasy, mysteriously menacing plants striking blind beauties while society falls apart around them.Of course, if your standard is not to re-live a wonderful time as a child in a cinema of screaming and laughing children, this film will probably do very little for you.  Viewed more cooly from my vantage as a middle-aged film buff, it is pretty weak as sci-fi.  Little is explained - the meteors somehow cause both blindness and a bizarre transformation in the triffids - and after the chaos of a society falling apart, the plot takes weird twists.  One group that the narrative follows forms a kind of family and inexplicably heads to southern europe, where after much danger they escape.  The other actors are a troubled couple of scientists, who miraculously discover that salt water dissolves the triffids after much failed study, again inexplicably.  And the effects!  Very bad compared to what is available today.Recommended for purposes of nostalgia only, unless you are a connoisseur of clunky monster flicks over lots of beer.",N/A
1178489,"Dark Floors (2008) is a Finnish supernatural horror thriller, that takes you on a weird journey through the wards of a hospital.  The story is atmospheric, and the special effects are mostly well executed, but the plot is slow moving, and a bit all over the place, as the characters make their way through what appears to be an alternate reality.  Director Pete Riski and Tomi Putaansuu, better known as ""Mr. Lordi"", came up with the story.  Lordi, and his four bandmates in the metal band Lordi, appear in the film as malevolent ghosts, demons, or monsters.A young girl named Sarah (Skye Bennett) is a patient in a hospital, and after an accident occurs while she is having an MRI, her father Ben (Noah Huntley), decides to take her home in the middle of the night.  Wheeling Sarah in a wheelchair, Ben enters an elevator on the eighth floor, as Emily (Dominique McElliot) a nurse, attempts to talk him out of leaving.  Riding down with several other passengers, something strange occurs and the car jerks to a stop.  Eventually the doors open on the sixth floor, which appears to be deserted.  The setting is quite eerie, as the group sees no one, until they encounter a woman with her eyes gouged out.Retreating in fear, they enter a stairwell, and move down one floor to the fifth, which is also deserted.  Acting as a group, these people are remarkably clueless, and Ben is continually losing track of his daughter.  When a ghost suddenly appears, Rick (Leon Herbet) a security guard, fires his gun with no effect, as the group heads down to the fourth floor.  Breaking from the pack, Jon (William Hope) attempts to take an elevator down, but is attacked and wounded by some kind of monster, before being rescued by the others.  It appears that Sarah is somehow the key to the strange events.  The survivors continue to work their way downwards to try and reach safety, but a deadly journey lies ahead for those who manage to stay alive.Dark Floors is a fantasy where anything can happen, but with a freehand to do almost anything, the direction the story takes is somewhat disappointing.  Even after seeing what they have seen, these people are trudging along with no sense of urgency to get out, seemingly unafraid for their lives.  Putting his daughter's life in the wrong hands, Ben is a guy with questionable judgment, and major problems maintaining focus on the task at hand.  Watching him gets to be increasingly frustrating, as he's painfully slow to react, and is kind of a bungler.  The film would be more effective if a solid emotional connection was established with Sarah, but she remains mostly a mystery, and a person that is difficult to really care about.  You might expect that some endearing quality might emerge about her, but it just doesn't happen.  While things seem to end well, it's hardly uplifting.Dark Floors is a slow moving atmospheric thriller with good production values, that for better or worse, features each of the members of the band Lordi to fairly good effect.  A reoccurring element involving loops in time, doesn't seem to add much to a story that is a more than a little obscure.",Dark Floors
1205243,I agree with another reviewer and found the lead actress to be completely uninteresting in this role.  When I watch masterpiece theater I expect fantastic acting especially from the lead character and I didn't get it here. However I did enjoy the actor who played Angel and thought he did a fine job.  The story is depressing so without fantastic acting I just didn't see the point of watching. The actress playing Tess says most of her lines in the exact same whiny inflection.  I found myself confused as to whether I should feel sorry for her or annoyed by her.  All in all I'd say it was ok... but not worthy of masterpiece.,Tess of the d'Urbervilles

1025642,"I actually liked this sequel better after a couple of viewings.  It did not really grab me the first time around, and my wife thought that it relied too much on slapstick (like the silly food fight). Some of the songs are pretty good but, overall, it is not on the same level as movies like Brother Bear.Now for the reaction of the audience that really counts in our household: our three-year old likes it a lot; the two-year old was so-so on Cinderella III at first, but now, like me, she enjoys it as well.The story line is adequately described elsewhere, so I see no need to repeat it, nor do I see the need to explain how I think it could have been done better. (But if you want to see an excellent non-animated version of the Cinderella story, check out ""Ever After - A Cinderella Story"" with Drew Barrymore. In ""Ever After"" you get an even deeper sense of the great injustice done to Cinderella by the evil stepmom.)Perhaps Cinderella III merits 4 stars for its entertainment value and, while that is basically all that these movies are about--entertainment, I just didn't think it was quite 4 stars, and I reserve 5 stars for movies, even animated ones, that also contain a meaningful message. Sure, Cinderella has a little more spunk in this sequel, but all she is fighting for is to get married to her true love (someone who she actually knows very little about). She is not fighting for any moral principle that I would like my daughters to recognize and repect.[Added notes: (1) While I fully respect their opinion, I disagree rather strongly with those reviewers who see Cinderella in the original version as a placid character who generates little emotional interest for the viewer. Think about her situation: after her father's death, she was made a servant in her own home(!) and she is completely under the control of the evil stepmom. To whom could she turn for help? No one.  And yet, she faced each day with spirit and renewed hope, and she responded with emotions appropriate to the abuse that was heaped upon her. Again, if you do not know children who have had to endure abusive home environments, count yourself lucky and just watch ""Cinderella - Ever After"" to get a glimpse at what life must have been like for Cinderella.2) All of these movie reviews are simply someone's opinion, and I find them all helpful. Whether the reviewer says ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"", the comments give me a feel for the movie. From the high number of ""not helpful's"" given to a lot of the reviews that rate Cinderella III and similar movies less than stellar, I am left to wonder if the raters are simply expressing their disagreement with the review's opinion.]",Cinderella III - A Twist in Time
876213,"I watched this movie last night.  Why it has been labled a ""gay"" movie is beyond my grasp.  It is simply a story of growing up:  learning to make your own decisions, to make your own way, and to understand that happiness usually is standing right in front of us.The movie's two central characters are Shane and Allen.  I don't agree at all that the gay character (Allen) caused the huge change in Shane. Shane CHANGED HIMSELF.  Like most of us going through life's journey, you have to experience--and hopefully LEARN from that experience--as you continue to grow.  Are you going to make some mistakes?  Sure you are; you're human.  This particular movie dealt more with the intricate bonding of two people:  one just happened to be gay.  So, if you're gay and you think you'll get some T&A; between the two lead characters, forget it.  That is NOT what this movie is about.Directed by David Gleeson, this movie's running time is 89 minutes and the version I watched was not rated.

1266349,"Others have commented about the edits in this 4th edition of the Taxi series, so I won't waste time with that. I will say that this is once one of my absolute favorite shows and I will be buying Season 5 without hesitation. However, thisi particular season is one of the weakest of the show's run. The ratings slid enough that it was cancelled and good fortune got it picked up by a rival network for the final season. The big difference, as fans learned in later years, was the effect that Andy Kaufman had on the show.What made Taxi so endearing was the creation of brilliant characters that were definitely New York personalities. It launched long careers for most of the cast. Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, Tony Danza, and company first came to national prominence because of their work on this show and the ensemble was exceptional. Unfortunately, the sudden fame had a negative impact on Andy Kaufman. After years toiling on the New York comedy scene and several memorable Saturday Night Live appearances, Andy was suddenly a superstar because of his Latka character. Sometimes a comic with a large repertoire of characters becomes resentful when one of his creations becomes more popular than the others. Robin Williams would regularly insult people in his audience who requested he do his Mork character, for example. Because he had talent in so many other areas, Robin moved past that period and Mork is now just a footnote in a long career. Sadly, Andy Kaufman didn't handle Latka's popularity nearly as well.By the middle of the third season, Kaufman was becoming increasingly difficult to work with on set. What had begun as an occasional annoyance during the filming of season 3, had grown into open warfare. He was often late, refused to talk to the rest of the cast, and began making unreasonable demands. The producers, deeply concerned that firing Kaufman would severely hurt the popularity of the show and already aware that Jeff Conaway would be leaving, began to do whatever they could to mollify Kaufman. The result was that the demands became more unrealistic, and the rest of the cast and writers became alienated. In season 4, Kaufman played his Latka character less and less. Instead, Latka developed multiple personalities. This allowed Kaufman to introduce a number of his more obnoxious creations to the nation. It also served to make Kaufman the center of an unbalanced number of episodes which also increased the unhappiness of the other cast members. There are times when you can actually see Judd Hirsch and several of the others openly roll their eyes at Kaufman in the background of some of the season 4 scenes. Finally the network became fed up and, after caving in and giving Kaufman his own prime time special (a famously bad bomb by the way) decided neither Kaufman nor the show was worth it. It's a shame because this was one of the shining examples of excellent casting and timing that television will ever see.Season 4 isn't a total loss. There are many wonderful episodes and famous Taxi moments to be found and fans of the series won't be disappointed by what they see. Christopher Lloyd, charged with the job of making the Reverend Jim character a viable replacement for Latka's oddness, really comes into his own and Devito in particular manages to chew up the scenery in his own unique way.  But if you find yourself thinking that something just doesn't seem quite right as you watch this season, hopefully this review will help you put your finger on it.Most tv shows reach a point where things seem to go adrift and quality slips. It's common enough that it has its own show business term; ""Jumping the Shark."" The name comes from the Happy Days episode where Fonzie jumps over a shark tank. It served as the best example of what happens when the creators of a show simply run out of good ideas. In Season 4 of Taxi, the show jumps the shark. As I said, that sort of thing happens all the time. What's unusual here is that the blame largely falls on the shoulders of one person. Andy Kaufman was a brilliant comic and a wonderful talent. He found humor in unique places and his fall from fame is well-chronicled. His unchecked ego badly impacted the quality of a fine tv show known not just for its humor, but also for its unflinching willingness to examine the sensitive issues of the day. Season 4 is no exception in this area as, among other things, we see Hirsch's Alex character explore interracial dating.As you watch this season of Taxi you will have to work around and tolerate the often bizarre manifestations of Andy Kaufman's alternate personalities. He will either dominate the proceedings in most episodes, or be completely absent because he didn't show and the writers had to work around his tantrums. I can tell you that both the story lines and the talent of the remainder of the cast make the effort well worth it. It's a true shame because had Kaufman been a bit more patient and handled things with more grace, this show could easily have remained successful for another 5 seasons instead of sputtering to a finish a year later.",N/A
189164,"Far from perfect. Far from mediocre. I'm very proud to welcome The Dead Hate The Living into the ranks of the ""good zombie movies"". It's not in the same batch with Romero or Fulci, but this one helps bridge the gap between the ""greats"" and the ""downright awful"". I think there has long been a big discrepancy between the two extremes with not a lot of movies falling in that mid-range.The movie revolves around a young director, named David Poe (Eric Clawson), making his first feature film, and it just happens to be about zombies. Oh, the irony of it all! Do you think he planned it that way? Of course he did, the character of David is really based on much of the life of director David Parker. David Poe's sisters and friends round up the cast and crew for the film. They've decided to break in to an abandoned hospital to make their film. And we all know what happens to people in horror films who do anything illegal or immoral...they die. Not to give anything away, but I'm sure we all know that by now. It wouldn't have been so bad had they left the corpse they found alone. And we all know what happens when you use a real corpse as an unpaid cast member in your new movie that you're making. Well, okay, so that one's not as obvious maybe, I've tried to tell you guys this, but I'll repeat it again for those who missed it. Don't mess with dead things! Just don't do it, it will save you all a lot of pain and grief.The Dead Hate the Living was a little slow to take off but once it did, it kept the tension till the end. Don't expect to jump out of your seats during the picture, but expect to get some creepy atmosphere. Parker brings us two of the more intimidating and scary zombies you'll ever see.There was copious amounts of gore, but none of it took away from the story, but rather served to compliment it. I think real horror fans will enjoy this movie because it was directed by a guy who really loves the genre and you can tell. Parker pays homage to many of the greats who have come before him, notably the likes of Carpenter, Fulci, Romero, and Raimi. He also pays homage to great make-up artist and actor Tom Savini and the best S-Mart employee of them all, Bruce Campbell. I challenge you to watch this movie, pay attention to the details, and see how many references to other movies you can find.If this movie had a higher budget they could have done a lot more with it and it could have been really amazing! That said, I think that Parker did a great job with what he had.",N/A

No dancing around the Dahlias then, just corpses.Allegedly funny, this modest genre outing proves nothing less than the pornography of violence, the sadism of which precludes any real fun. Did I say fun? There must be a reason why it has engendered so many repeat viewings and that can only be due to the performance of Jeff Combs, although the rest of the cast is strong. Combs manages to introduce elements of a walking cartoon into his performance without losing focus and realism. It's quite a turn. Having found his niche, Mr Combs has continued to work mostly outside the mainstream of movie production where he has no doubt progressed from playing the unhinged Mr West to characters without any window frame at all. I have only seen three of his oeuvre, so I cannot testify to the accuracy of this statement but should the situation change I expect uncanny prescience to be the order of the day.Nice touch when a character actually collapses from shock, an affliction that curiously escaped the beleagered Ash in 'The Evil Dead' in which he suffered considerably worse without the employ (however Dionysian) of a side kick.",N/A

The film doesn't remotely approach Richard Lester's wit or style. The style, what there is of it, is very broad, somewhat embarassing slapstick that gives you the idea it was made up as it went along.

The music, by John Addison (who did Tom Jones) is good but out of place. The real discovery, the tunes by Skip Bifferty (a band whose one album is highly sought after by collectors) are frustratingly short.

1447257,"I happened on Once Upon a Time by accident and the first two episodes had already aired. Once I watched the show I was certain of two things: This is a different take on fairy tales and someone needs to ramp up the acting.The biggest problem with putting across a show based on fairy tales is that the actors must be fully invested in the story and believe they are the characters they portray. Most of the acting is flat and uninspired and the actors' tongues are too prominent in their cheeks. Snow Falls came closer to what this show could be and I think that was because the actors have had a little more time in their parts.Snow Falls is a very different take on the Disney version of what happened to Snow White after the huntsman let her go and took a hart's heart back to the Evil Queen, and I don't remember reading in any version of the fairy tale that Snow White turned thief and terrorized the rich to keep for herself. That was unexpected and quite delightful. For the first time, I believed Snow White AKA Mary Margaret and that bodes well for the rest of the show.Emma is not nearly as surprising and tends to be flat and ho-hum about her part, even when cutting down the Mayor's apple tree. I wanted to see glee and a healthy shot of ""I can hurt you, too,"" coming from her and it just wasn't there. The most exciting part (a previous episode) was the long shot of the tree being cut.On the whole, the show is new and the actors not all that well known, which could play in their favor. Except for Rumpelstiltskin, who is devlishly demonic and gleeful, if not a little mad, the rest of the cast has a lot of work to do. Snow Falls was a step in the right direction and Snow White/Mary Margaret took the lead.

798821,"this is not a review, but the details of the film, copied from the DVD box:DetailsChristianity is a worldwide phenomenon, with millions of people across the globe practicing the word of God, and paying fastidious attention to the pages of the Bible. It wasn't always that way, however, as journalist Peter Jennings illustrates in this fascinating exploration of early Christian beliefs. The teachings of Christianity can be traced back to Jesus and Paul, who set down some of the fundamental beliefs in their brief tenure on the planet. Focusing largely on Paul, Jennings shows how he set the religion apart from Judaism, the possible negative effects he had, and how he interacted with Jesus and his family. It all adds up to a fascinating piece of history that is both revealing and highly educational.Cast, Crew & MoreStudio: KOCH Entertainment DistributionEditionUPC Code: 741952621898Release DetailsRuntime: 120 minRating: Not RatedLanguage: Original: English[...]",ABC News Presents The Search for Jesus

275005,"I saw the film when it was first released.  What stayed in my recollection is the Irish music, fine cinematography, brutal violence and some very inventive set pieces.  This blu ray disc reproduced some of the beautiful scenes e.g. in the forest but failed to tone down the makeup which made all men wore red lipsticks.  22 years on, the film now looks a bit flashy with a hollow center.  It is mainly due to the lacking of deeper explorations or descriptions of the 3 main charactors, the 2 gangsters and Gabriel Byrne's charactor, critically the latter.  How good a right hand man was he?  Why was he so like by his boss, even after he betrayed him?  Was he really heartless or souless?  Are they simply small time hoods?  It is all very ambiguous.  For these reasons, it is not a fully satisfying period crime film.",Miller's Crossing VHS
1627643,"It's late afternoon in Washington DC, terrorists have taken the White House, and the body count is rising by the second.  Olympus Has Fallen certainly has an attention-grabbing premise, but more often than not fails to deliver on its potential.The film opens at the presidential retreat Camp David, where we are introduced to Mike Banning, a Secret Service agent and personal friend to the president's family.  While Olympus Has Fallen allows us to take a few minutes to get to know its cast, Director Antoine Fuqua's style lets no moment linger, and the film quickly propels into high gear.  While leaving Camp David, there is a major car accident that Banning fails to prevent, leading to the death of the First Lady, and his expulsion from the Secret Service.A year and a half later, Banning is now working at a desk job, which everyone in Hollywood knows is the least fulfilling avenue of work anyone could possibly choose.  He's clearly defeated and still depressed over his past failure, but his chance for redemption comes from an unlikely source - a full-scale terrorist attack on the most heavily defended building in the world.  In what is undoubtedly the film's best scene, terrorists both in the air and on the ground manage to breach the White House's defenses and hold the president hostage in his bunker, with Banning managing to trap himself inside the building as well.From here on out, it's a fairly typical Die Hard scenario - one man against everyone else in the building.  It sounds like it would work, it ought to work, but it unfortunately doesn't.  Where Die Hard's John McClane would more often than not barely escape an encounter with a bad guy without all his bones broken, Banning much more closely resembles a straight-up super soldier.  Any encounter with terrorists inevitably ends in their being beaten within seconds, which robs the film of a lot of its potential tension.  Frankly, the entire film loses tension simply because of how trigger-happy it is.  Rarely has a major film featured so many on-screen deaths, both of civilians and political figures.  After two straight hours of such wanton violence, it completely loses its impact.The acting is good, with several big names doing a great job, but the casting ultimately feels like the film is playing it safe.  Morgan Freeman plays Speaker of the House Allen Trumbull with a beleaguered demeanor that you would expect of someone forced to take the office of president during such a crisis.  Ultimately, though, it's basically the role we've come to expect of Freeman - no surprises here.  Aaron Eckhart plays the president, and again, it's a fairly predictable performance for anyone who remembers Eckhart as Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight.  Only Gerald Butler, who plays Banning, adds any sort of nuance to his role, and that's frequently just due to how convincing he is as a man seeking redemption for past failures.While Olympus Has Fallen is frequently fun, it often feels like a missed opportunity.  Despite its undoubtedly large budget, its A-list cast, and iconic location, it rarely rises to any higher level than ""average"".",N/A
660656,"Actually 3 and a half stars.Despite a lot of Big Hair, this is not a big movie.  Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable romp, with some affecting performances.  There is nothing revelatory or even unpredictable about the story, but it works nicely and certainly entertains.  The film does have a few rich moments, but seems mostly a vehicle for a group of talented actors (and it is a highly pedigreed bunch here) to take decent material and put out a fun and sometimes very moving film.  While it may drag a little in the center, don't give up watching for the finale and Rachel Griffiths ""total look"" finish that is about as outrageous and breathtaking a ""total look"" as one can possibly imagine.  Alan Rickman sometimes feels a little bit on autopilot, Josh Hartnett is underused, but surprisingly effective in an important role and Natasha Richardson, as ever, glows on the screen and raises the stakes, making the whole thing worthwhile.Not great, but a good little movie.",N/A
786714,"I tried to like this because this is normally the type of movie that I would choose to view and I am a Diane Lane fan, but this movie did not impress me.  Diane Lane plays a fairly submissive role.  She doesn't sparkle or shine, and neither does the cinematographer's rendition of the Tuscan countryside. There are some pretty scenes, but they don't carry over to set the mood for the film as they should. Certainly not enough to redeem this movie above standard fare. There are several likeable characters in the movie. I especially enjoyed the older,handsome,but unfortunately married real estate agent.  I felt for Ms. Lane's character - too bad he was taken!  I haven't read the book, but I read a review that said that actually the main character and her husband renovated the house in Tuscany (not the new divorcee on her own looking for love and fulfillment), so maybe that's why this movie falls short -too much artistic license.  In any case, you might enjoy this light movie, or you might be disappointed, but if you like Diane Lane's natural beauty and intensity, you should see &quot;A Walk On the Moon&quot; (one of my favorite movies)and &quot;Unfaithful&quot;.

669150,"I guess I don't know a good zombie movie from a bad one because I totally don't get all the criticisms this movie has received over the years.  Over 50 1-star reviews here on amazon?  Really?  Maybe it's because I'm a total Resident Evil geek.  I believe Resident Evil 2 and 3 are some of the best video games on the Playstation.  This movie actually resembles the slow-moving, suspenseful build-up in the storyline, scenery AND zombie movements of that classic video game series.  I wasn't expecting anything approaching that given the assortment of negative feelings here on amazon.Children of Living Dead begins with an arrogant and athletic man out in the field of some no name town and he's totally unafraid of the zombies around him.  He frequently opens fire and takes out all the zombies in the surrounding area.  He even gets creative by pushing a car down a hill, having the zombies walk up to it, then shoots and blows the vehicle up, haha.  Well everything goes fine until he enters the upstairs of a barn and stumbles upon a SUPER zombie that can't be killed like the other ones.  Upon opening fire the zombie continues forward and takes the man out!  Luckily all the children hiding in the barn make it safely outside due to a police officer being around.  Thank goodness he was there!  Of course... well, the kids aren't so lucky after all.  You'll see what I mean.I really like the scenery.  Everything is really dark and gloomy and it actually perfectly captures a zombie infested area.  The film is presented beautifully.The reason I'm taking away two stars is because, for one thing, the ending is just *terrible*.  No suspense or really satisfying conclusion to speak of.  The movie just ENDS and that's it.  Huh?  And two, the entire segment with the graveyard and digging up the caskets wasn't properly written.  I mean the bulldozers that were planning to build a parking lot for a car dealership would occasionally tip over a casket and everyone would stop working to check out what's inside.  This whole scene felt like it lacked serious potential for suspense.  Or perhaps the writers shouldn't have wasted so much time on this graveyard segment since nothing memorable or conclusive ever came out of it anyway.  It was overlong and pointless.So yeah, an undeveloped storyline overall, but the believable zombie movements and presentation is actually REALLY surprisingly good.  Some of the best looking zombies next to the Resident Evil series, I kid you not.  Even the acting from the helpless victims was a step above the rest.  Overall, go ahead and hate me but I liked it!",N/A
667962,"Wow. That's all I can say after watching this, one of the silliest (and conceptually grossest) of all of Mikels' films. I am a true fan of bad movies, but I have mixed feelings on this one. On the one hand the director's commentary is very interesting, even though it's disturbing what he finds funny (no surprise there, I suppose...), and it is a fun movie to mock in a kind of 'Plan 9' way (The 'sets' of the hospital are amazingly realistic! Not!), certainly the plot is silly and fun to riff on. In essence we have a corrupt, near-bankrupt cat food magnate running the Lotus Cat Food Company who decides to cut costs by grinding up corpses, cadavers, and later his own victims. (That's a plus: it certainly beats 'downsizing'; laying off all your employees in the States and exporting their jobs overseas, as is all the managerial rage today.) The only problem is that once the cats taste human flesh, they return to their wild roots and attack their owners, killing them in the most hilarious 'attack' sequences you have ever seen. It is wonderful watching the people holding onto the killer cats for dear life, trying to keep them from running away while making it look like a life or death struggle. Eventually a doctor and nurse couple finds out what's going on and confronts the evil cat food magnate in the climactic scene.So much for the good part. The bad part is that while very unrealistic, the movie was still gross, in a disgusting, dirty way. The repeated scene of the meat coming out of the meat grinder was not really especially gory, but it was used about a thousand times and got pretty tiresome. I like these nutty, cult movies, but I think Mikels has done better, and way more amusing, movies, such as &quot;Girl in the Gold Boots&quot;. If you have seen that movie as well, you will note that several key people are in both movies, and in fact they were filmed in the same year.Overall, I decided on three stars for boring gore and general amateurishness, although I debated about giving it four stars which is probably what it would deserve for most grade Z movie fans. The deciding factor, interestingly, was an extra on the DVD. The DVD has several extras including the director's commentary track, a filmography, behind the scenes pictures (don't expect too much), and a video 'tribute' to the movie by Bentmen called 'Immaculate Contraption'. I found 'Immaculate Contraption' to be the five most painful minutes of cinema viewing in my life. It was badly produced (and not in a campy, fun way), the music was wretched, and it was generally putrid. That became the tiebreaker and earned the film three stars instead of the four I originally intended. Save yourself the pain. 'Immaculate Contraption' is neither immaculate or a contraption, but it positively is rubbish.",The Corpse Grinders
829439,"Film: *****  Extras: *****  DVD Transfer Quality: BOMBAnother huge disappointment from Fox Home Video.  ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" was 20th Century-Fox's most prestigious production of 1938, featuring three of the studio's biggest box office draws (Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, and Don Ameche); a marvelous supporting cast led by Ethel Merman, Jean Hersholt, and John Carradine; outstanding direction by veteran Henry King; and a slight but entertaining script that showcased more than two dozen of prolific songwriter Irving Berlin's most beloved melodies.  The prototype for the big budget musicals that Fox would perfect in the 1940's, the film was a huge hit with the public and critics alike, garnering six Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) and winning the statuette for Best Music Scoring.One might think that Fox would take special care in mastering such a revered film for its DVD release - especially when releasing it under the Fox ""Studio Classics"" banner - but one would be wrong.  Although the film's soundtrack has been painstakingly preserved, the visuals are inexcusably shoddy. Specifically, there is a visual noise line that appears in the midst of Chapter 8 (during the song ""Now It Can Be Told"") and continues to disrupt the picture for the remaining hour or so of the film.  This distortion never appeared on the various prints shown on pay cable stations during the past 20 years, and should not appear in a home video release that purports to be ""restored"".This major and obnoxious glitch is especially upsetting because the rest of the DVD is so appealing.  The extras include 3 rarely seen musical sequences that were deleted from the final cut of the film; the Original Theatrical Trailer; Fox Movietone News footage of the film's British premiere (fascinating to see the English hoopla surrounding this quintessentially American feature); and best of all, the full-length A&E; Biography segment, ""Alice Faye: The Girl Next Door"".

There is close observation of details in how we talk to each other, much of which is very funny.

Her examples of ""fake"" and real smiles are terrific to watch, as is her panic being at a party where she is a nobody.

1072102,"Dan Chupong (""Born To Fight"") plays a vengeful young hero in Thai action film ""Dynamite Warrior."" The film is set in countryside of Thailand in 1920s and our hero dressed like a cowboy is looking for the murderer responsible for the deaths of his parents while taking away buffalos from the rich (after fighting the ""bad"" cow keepers) and giving them to the poor. The story is confusing and jokes often misfire, but probably you would not care much.First this is not ""Ong-Bak"" where no CGI is used. ""Dynamite Warrior"" uses plenty of them during the action scenes, but this is only necessary because of the nature of the weapons the protagonist uses against the villains (please see below). Fortunately Dan Chupong can do action stunts and some of them are impressive, but the film and its repetitive actions obviously need more time to let him show what he really can do. This is regrettable for Panna Rittikrai, who plays the arch-villain in this film, is actually stunt coordinator of ""Ong-Bak."" Dan Chupong is one of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s and hence the importance of the final battle scene, but the film takes too much time to go there.The daredevil hero uses one unique weapon - huge firecrackers (not exactly dynamites as the title says). Dan Chupong's hero even rides one like surfing, which is quite silly but funny, but this idea does not develop much. Like many other visual tricks and martial arts stunts in ""Dynamite Warrior,"" director seems content with using his ideas repeatedly in simplest way.

The animation and color pallet are very bright and modern as is the soundtrack which incorporates more original music than the old school shows (which tended to re-use temp scores and source music over and over) but manages to work in familiar themes.For Scooby Doo purists there is no sacrilege here. Shaggy and Scooby/Fred are performed by Casey Kasem and Frank Welker so there's not too much of a divide between this and old school to distance older fans from the new show.For what it is, the DVD presents the show absolutely flawlessly in 1.33:1 full frame with pretty active Dolby 2.0 surround and some minimal fluff extras.

The music is great, and the whole experience is bizarre.I think she did a good job for what she had to work with, which was a pretty dull script. The costuming and sets were all pretty top notch, as was most of the acting. John Lithgow, who played her husband, did a good job, in that he gave me the creeps. There was pretty good chemistry between she and her brother in law, making you believe they could have a thing goin' on.An orphaned New Zealand girl married to an older, wealthy businessman learns to deal with his strange sexual desires.There are so many problems with Mesmerized, it is difficult to decide just where to begin with them.

This movie suffered from poor cinematography with dulled-out color & poor lighting. Jody Foster also served as co-producer.Whatever happened behind the scenes with Mesmerized, it is clear that Jodie Foster bears culpability for much of this film's awfulness. She gave what was quite possibly the single worst performance in her acting career thus far. Throughout the entire movie, Foster's eyes have the glazed look that is so typical of cocaine users.. This is interesting in light of the fact that in December 1983, she was arrested and charged with possession of a small amount of cocaine.

980204,"Now that my copy has sold on Amazon Marketplace, I can let loose with my bitter, bitter disappointment with the third season of this show. The first two seasons of Arrested Development was the funniest stuff I ever saw on American television. But this third season was simply not the same program. Never has the change of a show's writers been more abjectly evident in the quality of humor.Some of the previous reviewers have pointed this out, but the over-whelming majority of those who have been writing here have used this as a soapbox to castigate Fox for cancelling the show. On one level, that's understandable, but I've found very few reviewers willing to admit that Season 3 just isn't that funny.There seemed to be an emphasis on being ""clever"" rather than laugh-out-loud funny. I found the incessant, non-stop sexual innuendo/double entendre -- usually of the homoerotic variety -- to be a lame subsitute for actual humor. Were we really expected to burst into laughter at that stuff? It was like watching a ""Worst Of"" SNL special.The ""Call back"" technique -- where actions, dialogue, etc, of previous episodes is referenced again -- was way overdone. Again, if it had been written in such a way that it was funny, it would have been different. But using call-back just for the sake of doing it is pointless.There were some laughs -- the Tiny Town episode was probably the best. But by the second disc of this two-disc set, I knew I was watching just to complete the series. It wasn't funny any more and I could watch an entire episode with a straight face; impossible in the first two seasons.The writers and producers of this show would have better served us by keeping the quality at the same earlier level rather than doing whatever they did that produced this embarrassing third season.

This show is the true heir to Arrested Development's vacated throne; yet, unfortunately and unsurprisingly, Universal has given it a boxset worthy of its meagre ratings (around 6 million/year).  The commentaries (which are mostly dry solo affairs--no fun cast commentaries as on the AD sets) are not presented with their respective episodes but rather cordoned off onto the skimpy extras disc in order to justify the two-volume version of same (created for casual fans of a show without casual fans).  The original pilot that the TV critics watched with Rachel Dratch is not included.  It's also the little things:  The first and third cases have the same cover as the box, yet there is a different cast photo collage on the second case, which should have been on the third (extras) case instead (if my design sensibility is correct).  That same photo collage is used on all the menus, including disc 2, which has the other cast collage on the cover.  For the discs themselves, they merely ported the individual picture of each of the principals from, again, that same photo collage, onto each disc.  It's this sort of cheap thoughtlessness that seems invested throughout this set.  Perhaps this show is too downloaded to put much effort into its physical presentation.

I think Marilyn was, incidentally, one of the sources of the problems in movies today where there is too much of a prominence placed on symbolism over substance.  Having said that, Marilyn did a pretty good job in this movie.  I saw more substance in this movie than all the others I've seen combined.  The scene in the desert, where she screams at the brutality of the misfits, was top notch.  In that scene, and a few others in the movie, she displayed some acting talent that is missing in most of today's top starlets.  She evoked a lot of power in some scenes without saying a word.  In other scenes, she over acted a little.Gable played Gable throughout most of the movie, but the scene when he cried out to children was an odd scene for him to take part in.  It showed more weakness in the few minutes it occurred than I've seen in most of the few Gable movies I've seen.Clift was good, but I've seen him better in other movies.  He tended to play the same character in many of his movies, and that character was in this movie too.  He may have been a good actor, but I never saw too much range from him.The movie itself was uneven and inconsistent.  The lead to the arc was very interesting.  I can see why it was considered an off movie for it's era. It kind of lost itself in the arc, however, and I found myself wavering a little in the midst of the overdrawn characterization and setting.  There were interesting scenes, and I can see why some of the scenes were important, but they were a little too long.  Other scenes seemed irrelevant to me.  The close of the movie, from the point where they reach the desert on, was excellent.  All of the characters--even the Eli Wallach character--were rounded out here.  The close of the movie provided an explanation for why some of the scenes that I considered irrelevant were in fact relevant.  Overall, I considered this a really good movie.

939995,"I have mixed feelings about this performance. Filmed for British TV in 1979, ten years after Dusty's last chart hit, there is an air of ""lounge act"" to this show, with its medley of hits and her covers of trendy disco tunes that she felt obliged to include here (it would have been better had she sung Pattie Brooks' great ""After Dark"", where Brooks sounds uncannily like Dusty.) Dusty recorded some interesting things around this time period, and she could have done justice to a few of her recent recordings, but she chose not to, and instead did a couple of ballads which are effective, but a bit sad (especially one where she sings about not being the latest rage). For a show that apparently was a big deal, with the Queen in attendance, Dusty giggles through a few tunes, including ""The Look of Love"", spoiling the mood. Despite all this, it's interesting to see how the audience clearly loves her. It's too bad there are no shows available from her 1960s TV show. I have a bootleg copy of one of them, and although the quality isn't great, the performances are, with Dusty in her prime, complete with the high hairdos and black makeup, singing incredibly, gesturing enthusiastically, and even playing guitar (on the lovely ""Wayfaring Stranger""). It wasn't until the Pet Shop Boys brought her back into the spotlight with ""What Have I Done to Deserve This"" in 1987 that we got to see & hear Dusty in top form again, which led to several more hits (""Nothing Has Been Proved"", ""In Private"" and ""Reputation"").

It's hard to remember that it's his charisma that made him a star and you can really see it in Beneath The Darkness. Dennis Quaid plays Vaughn Ely, a mortician who is bat shit crazy. To the town, Ely is this great guy who gives back to the community, but only one person can see him for what he really is. Travis (Tony Oller) is a local teenager who works odd jobs for Ely and has always had suspicions about the man, but never did anything about it. One night, the subject comes up while with his friends and they decide to bust into Ely's home to find out what he's really hiding. The story starts out very slowly and I wasn't expecting it to get any better, but it really does. I already mentioned how good Quaid is, but the star of this film is Tony Oller. I've heard him sing, but I've never seen him act, and to say I was impressed is an understatement. Between Quaid's outlandish behavior and Oller's teenage angst, I didn't need much of a story to follow in order to be entertained.

Whatever people may think of Frank, he has a point when he says: ""It's not my fault that the play was lousy.""A flaw here is that April and Frank are both unhappy with their lives. And while April looks for an irrational escape, Frank seems more set in reality that they have 2 children as well as responsibilities. True, Frank is not happy at his job. But he's not going to 'jump ship' when he has a wife and 2 children. (One pun on ""The Titanic"" here is inevitable.)Later, April gets a strange idea to run away to France. What she says may sound good in THEORY. But how can she be sure of getting a job? Frank again carries reason when he says: ""It might make more sense if I were a writer or painter.""It is worth noting that while the movie doesn't mention it, April may very well be bipolar. The movie tries to keep sympathy balanced between the characters, but it just doesn't work. Towards the latter half, April finds that she is pregnant. And Frank knows that he has to go back to reality and accept a great promotion he has been offered.Whether you are anti abortion or pro choice, there is an unavoidable sting of reality when Frank says: ""A sane woman doesn't perform an abortion on herself so she can live out some fantasy."" April responds that it is for him. And Frank understandably responds: ""How can it be for me when the mere thought of it makes my stomach sick?!""Frank desperately tries to save the shambled remains of their marriage, but April only gets more cruel: ""I never loved you. You're just a man who made me laugh at a party."" At this point, we can scarcely blame Frank for his rage here: ""Then why are you living in my house? Why are you my wife?"" Also to his credit, despite his rage, he is able to avoid physically striking her.Another serious flaw in this movie is that they try to make a cruel and nasty man carry weight. (What he says is not fit to be printed here and would probably not be allowed here.) Charles Dickens often put the voice of reason into eccentrics, but without the profanity and cruelty.I'm not saying the movie does not have some worthwhile moments. But the story just doesn't work. While it tries to make April heroic, it just does not work. And it seems to try to make Frank look bad for keeping one foot in reality.Sorry; usually lightening just won't strike twice.",Revolutionary Road
804506,"Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Otto Preminger's 'Where the Sidewalks Ends,' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel 'Night Cry' by Frank Rosenberg...Dana Andrews is the honest, tough New York policeman, always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong-arm methods as much as he detests crooks... When he hit someone, his knuckles hurt... And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain (Gary Merrill) who points up the title. 'Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter?' he asks Andrews. 'I have as much right on the sidewalk as you.'Dana Andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief... His deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta...By a twist of irony unique to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of 'Laura' are united once more, and Andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later, but no longer the romantic, beaten down by his job, by the cheap crooks... This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect... The killing is accidental, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail...Using his knowledge of police procedure, he covers up his part in the crime, plants false clues, and tries to implicate a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case himself... The double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder, is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise...The film is one of the best detective films of the 50's, with curious moral values, also one of Preminger's best...Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism...",N/A

The American networks are depending on so called reality Tv shows- a sure way to rid themselves of excellent writers and actors, especially after the writer's strike some years ago. The television industry is ran by idiots who's bottom line is making the fast profit. I bought this DVD because it seemed rather interesting and lets face it no one tells a better story than the British writer. I like period pieces and the British seem to be experts in the Victorian and Edwardian era. I learned quite a bit from this mini series. I was not aware that women in the upper ranks of society did not take care of their own children.Also the upper crust would leave thier children for over a year with servants. They were more concerned with their sex lives . The servant was given the brunt of the aristocrat's irresponsibility. I thought ""HOW BARBARIC"". No doubt -this program was a pure soap opera with all of its melodrama but it was well written- well acted and it engaged me but there is o need for a continution because where else could one go with a story line like this. The writers would be repeating themselves. This production was quite good but I would not want to revisit this world any time soon.",N/A

1226380,"""Slumdog Milionaire"" is definitely a feel-good movie - from early on,young Jamal [Dev Patel] wins our hearts as he desperately tries to find his childhood sweetheart Latika [Freida Pinto] by entering the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Incredulous and sceptical of Jamal's intelligence [after all, Jamal is a 'slumdog'], the show's host [Anil Kapoor] gets him carted off by the police for interrogation. Faced by the cynical inspector [Irfan Khan of ""Namesake""], Jamal proceeds to convince the policeman of his innocence by recounting his childhood experiences till the present that accounts for his almost miraculous run of good luck on the show.I loved the child actors in this show - the ones who played Jamal, his brother Salim and Latika as children were absolutely incredible and wholly credible as street children struggling to survive, falling prey to the most predatory and repugnant of criminals, those who maim children in order that the kids may 'convincingly' beg on the streets to fill the criminals coffers. One of the most horrifying scenes in this movie is the part where the criminal mastermind watches over the removal of a little boy's eyes.So why only 3 stars you may ask - I liked this movie a lot but I did find that it didn't truly explore the plight of street children which it purportedly aims to portray on-screen. The coverage somehow seems shallow, using the story arc of the child maiming syndicate to shock audiences instead. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I've watched too many Indian movies that deal more convincingly with such themes - ""Nayagan"" [Tamil, starring Kamal Hasan, a renowned South Indian actor], Thalapathi [Tamil, stars Rajni Kanth], the incomparable Salaam Bombay [1988,Hindi by Mira Nair], and also City of Joy [1992, English, starring Patrick Swayze] all are more credible in showing the plight of street children.""Slumdog Millionaire"" on the other hand is a Bollywood fairytale with a predictably happy ending. It makes one feel good, and in a world filled with cruelty and depravity, most of us are happy to see the fulfillment of Jamal's dreams. But reality is very different, and the majority of street children in India will never experience even a fraction of the success that Jamal attains in this movie. Final verdict: excellent and visually stunning escapist fare.",N/A

717540,"The Lathe of Heaven refers to the dreams of George Orr, a seemingly ordinary young man whose dreams shape the waking reality of the world.  In fact, his dreams change the entire past, present and future history in such a way that only he and his puzzling friend Manny seem to have any memory of an alternate past after he awakens.  Afraid that he may dream some horrible fate upon the world, George turns to drugs for dream suppression --- only to overdose and earn himself court-ordered therapy with appointed psychiatrist Dr. Haber.Haber starts out with the best intentions, but as their dream therapy sessions progress he finds himself believing Orr's fantastic claims, and temptation leads him to manipulate George's dreams for his own advancement.  George soon catches on to what his doctor is doing, confronts him, and sets in motion a race not only for his own freedom but the future of humanity.TLOH works on the level of a psychological thriller rather than action-based science fiction.  A somewhat surrealistic atmosphere underlies every scene, leading us to question whether or not each incarnation of reality after Geoorge wakes may be yet another extension of his dreaming.  The philosophical questions provoked by George's unique situation (Is all reality but a dream? Is Manny even a  real person? Is George the defacto God of his universe?) have an unmistakable existentialist slant.I admit to never having read the novel by Ursula K. LeGuin upon which TLOH is based.  Therefore, I approached this made for cable TV adaptation with no particular expectations.  I thought it was well done for what it was, although by no means could it compete with a high-budget feature film production.  Still, the small cast of main actors were exceptionally well chosen for their roles:  James Caan was comfortable as Dr. Haber and convinced me that he may well have been a psychologist in another life; Lukas Haas was the perfect innocent; Lisa Bonet, while playing the same character type as always, really seemed suited to the role of coolly mysterious attorney/ dream girl Heather LaLache.  In all, the cheerless gray future of @ 30 years from now is realized very plausibly, mainly through set and wardrobe design, with little attempt at ""sci-fi-isms"" such as robot servants or aliens (which I understand made an appearance in the original version).If you can suspend your disbelief and appreciate toned-down, philosophical science fiction, you will be able to enjoy the Lathe of Heaven.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",Lathe Of Heaven
520930,"First: Prime's cloud copy of this film is superb H.D. home viewing! Now for the film itself: There are some good moments in &#34;Red Planet&#34;, but overall it's more fantasy than science fiction with dreadful dialog and a fun, exciting, but extremely unlikely scenario. First, the timeline suggested, that is that by the 2050s humans have accomplished as much terraforming on Mars as pictured, is to stretch even an amateur space buff's credulity. Also, the Mars One ship is so massively over-designed for its small crew that it seems impossible to ever imagine how its construction could be justified. My problem with the script writers is with their wanna-be oh-so-cool rock-and-roll dialog, such as Gallagher's &#34;F this planet!&#34; nonsense uttered at the end of the film.The underlying faith vs. science theme isn't explored as well as it could have been.

468763,"David Cronenberg is a very sick man. Everytime I tape another one of his movies &amp; sit down to watch it, I wonder about an industry that would continue to give this man money with which to record his personal obsessions. Of course, the fact that I find it necessary to tape &amp; watch the films provides the answer!&quot;eXistenZ&quot; is, in a nutshell, Cronenberg's return to the themes of his first film &quot;Videodrome&quot;. Since &quot;Videodrome&quot; was produced at the dawn of the cable era, it used the video aspect of modern society to make its' points. Now that computer gaming is so much a part of modern society, Cronenberg has found an even more potent tool for his surgical dissections of mass media.To viewers who haven't seen this earlier work, Cronenberg's repeated use of &quot;bioports&quot;, &quot;gamepods&quot; &amp; other artifacts of mutant genentech may seem ripped out of William Gibson's later works. However, &quot;Videodrome&quot; presented us with repellent representations of man merging with plastic way back in the late 70's (well before Gibson was a household name). The vision however has grown much darker. We've watched the progression thru the intermediate works of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, &quot;the Krays&quot; &amp; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; but &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is so dark as to be almost unwatchable at times.I realize I am completely ignoring any plot synopses, but you can read other reviews for that. I will mention that Jennifer Jason Leigh does excellent work as the &quot;demoness Allegra Geller&quot; &amp; Jude Law does an excellent &quot;PR nerd&quot; keeping an American accent credibly thruout.Will you enjoy &quot;eXistenZ&quot;?

127520,"Is ""Titanic"" a marvelously crafted film?  You bet your life preserver it is.  It is hard to argue that the film did not deserve the Oscars it won for Visual Effects, Film Editing and Cinematography.  However, does the fact that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences went insane in 1997 (awarding 11 Oscars out of 14 nominations) make it a great film, or is it simply a bunch of eye candy wrapped around an unbelieveably cheesy love story?Rich girl meets poor (but plucky) boy from the wrong side of the tracks and starts a romance doomed to failure.  My goodness, we surely have never seen this story before, now have we?  No amount of special effects, as magnificent as they may be, can conceal the cringe-worthy dialogue between Leo & Kate that the viewer is forced to endure.  The dialogue makes me think at times of those wretched, teen-angst-riddled WB dramas that currently infest the airwaves.  There are whole scenes that are almost unbearable to watch, the dialogue gets to be so poor.Even the spectacular nature of the movie has waned a little bit in the intervening years.  Like many summer blockbuster flicks tht are largely propelled by their special effects, ""Titanic"" is one of those movies best seen on the big screen.  Once it is transferred to the more confined medium of a television screen --- even a big one --- the impact of the images on the screen tends to be lessened, and one is forced (sadly) to rely on the skill of the actors to maintain the interest of the viewers.  I don't think anyone is going to remember ""Titanic"" for its riveting performances.  Kate Winslet does an adequete job, but I think the Academy was being pretty generous in giving her a nomination for Best Actress.  Nothing against the old crone who played the billion-years-old Rose, but what in her performance really merited a nomination anyway?  As to the performances of the rest of the cast --- well, I think it says volumes that the Academy, while it was handing out nominations left and right, elected not to honor most of the principals with acting nominations.This isn't a totally horrible film by any means --- at points it can be quite moving & touching.  There are times when the ship was near sinking, as one sees the various passengers coping with a death that is rapidly approaching, that one wishes the whole movie could be like this.  Unfortunately, James Cameron preferred to go the route of cheesy romance, and that results in an average movie at best.",Titanic VHS

Attempting to make an epic story through the inclusion of the powerful dragons, the plot quickly devolved into nonsense.  The hero of the story, played by Justin Whalen who should have stuck with the Superman television show, is gifted by the fey with a superior sword midway through the film, but continues to lose every sword fight he gets into.  His bumbling sidekick, played comedically by Marlon Wayans, is enjoyable but dies all too soon to suit mood of the movie.  Their pairing makes it difficult to imagine them as the heroes of a film trying to be epic in its storyline.  Aside from the over-the-top acting from Jeremy Irons and the little-used apprentice mage love-interest, none of the other characters makes an impact in the story.  The dwarven and elven companions to the group never even get one swing in during the entire movie, making their inclusion even more preposterous as they become more liability to their scenes than a benefit.The best way to approach this film is to not expect too much, roll with the lack of reasonable plotline, and simply enjoy what it does deliver.

583695,"As if we didn't have enough ghostly little tales in the past few years (The Sixth Sense, Stir Of Echoes, etc.), another comes down the pike with an interesting twist - the main character doesn't see ghosts, but she definitely knows when people are going to die.  The idea for the story supposedly based upon the psychic abilities of Virginia Faulkner Thornton (Billy Bob Thornton's mother - she predicted his Oscar win), ""The Gift"" is a trim little package of murder, trepidation and the supernatural, peppered with an all-star cast and crew of Oscar winners (Swank, Thornton) and nominees (Blanchett, Kinnear, Harris).Annie Wilson (Blanchett) is a humble mother of three quietly making a living in fictional Brixton, GA off of social security from her husband's death and performing psychic readings for the townspeople.  Her recitations consist of one burning taper and a bizarre deck of cards with various symbols (star, circle, wavy lines, etc.) printed on them.  Her abilities as a clairvoyant are honest and true but (wouldn't you know it) Brixton is a backwoods community full of conservatives, skeptics and zealous Christians that believe the reserved widow is a practicing witch.  One man in particular named Donnie Barksdale (Reeves) harbors a special hatred for Annie because his battered wife Valerie (Swank) has been visiting the psychic's home on a regular basis to receive readings.  Donnie harasses Annie, making direct threats to her and her sons and even breaking into her home to creatively render the word ""Satan"" with her cosmic deck.  When Jessica King, the aristocratic daughter (Holmes) of a Brixton bigwig, turns up missing Annie has a vision that will help the BPD locate her.  She is at first snubbed by the chief of police for her marked reputation but when authorities finally take a chance on her, Jessica's body is found on Donnie Barksdale's property and he is immediately taken into custody for her murder. There's a bigger game afoot however, and Annie must single-handedly solve the mystery before the killer attempts to silence her permanently.Blanchett does her best to look simultaneously frightened and determined as Annie, a woman who is against all odds.  We already have proof of her abilities as a dramatic actress (Elizabeth, Paradise Road) and she is not disappointing here, sporting a decent Georgian accent and making her character human despite her inhuman abilities.  Holmes looks too young for her role and it's hard to fathom the chemistry between the 22-year-old actress and her 38-year-old co-star Kinnear (my husband even remarked that she looked like a teenager wearing her mother's clothes).  It's even more weird to see her sexing up ""Office Space"" yeeah-guy Gary Cole (who is 45) in a scene involving bathroom whoopie.  I guess it's just another case of casting directors pitting a beautiful ing&eacute;nue with a handsome fogey twice their age (a la Richard Gere/Winona Ryder, Bo Derek/Dudley Moore, etc.).  Kinnear does an admirable job as Wayne Collins, but a project like this is too simple an undertaking for his acting skills; most likely it was a labor of love for him.  Reeves actually manages to himself seem intimidating as Donnie Barksdale and Swank plays another dimwitted southerner minus the sexual identity crisis.  Oscar nominee Rosemary Harris makes a brief appearance as Blanchett's intuitive grandmother.  Ribisi is the standout here as the erratic Buddy Cole, a man who is consistently on the precipice of a psychological meltdown.  He is a blubbering, tearful mess one minute, hot-blooded and precarious the next.  What is really compelling about Ribisi's performance is the inner turmoil divulged in his roan and expressive eyes.  We know all we need to know about his character's struggle to stay sane simply by surveying his face.  Not a lot of actors have the ability to embody their characters in this way and Ribisi is to be commended for making Buddy a dynamic and remarkable individual.  Although he has yet to get the Academy's attention, the future looks incredibly bright for him and it's almost certain that he will become a hot commodity in the next few years.""The Gift"" delivers most of what it promises but sci-fi/horror fans will most likely be disappointed by its artsy approach (compliments of director Sam Raimi), its failure to scare the bejesus out of them (The Gift has MINOR scares) and its sad predictability.  The story manages to point an accusing finger at everyone but about halfway through (or even sooner) it's easy to identify the culprit.  If you're looking for a semi-suspenseful flick with a distinct and talented cast, ""The Gift"" is an ideal and enjoyable rent.",N/A

Then we have a thriller when a discredited doctor starts to see a different picture. Is he being paranoid? Is his own downfall making him clutch to straws. Then there is the patient and double victim of a terrible crime. It is a fresh prespective to see a thriller from someone else than a cop, lawyer or news reporter. It could have been a brilliant film. The problem was with the pace of the story. Slow it was but the worst part was that the introduction took up the first 50 minutes of the film, that is to say before it became a thriller. The story before that is of a seriously depressed woman coping with her life. Even once the thriller begins it is slow. There is a lot of good elements in there but it lacks the pace to make it engaging.",N/A

583471,"Although I had, of course, heard of this film, I never saw it untill I purchased this DVD.  It seems that everyone raves about this movie, calling it a classic and one of the best sci-fi films ever made.  To me it was kind of dissapointing.  I was expecting it to be great, like everyone says it is, but in reality, it really wasn't all that terrific.  The plot, of course, as everyone knows, concerns a team of military personnel that unearths a spaceship encased in ice that contains an alien.  After discovering that the alien is dangerous, they have to find a way to destroy it.  One of the characters, a scientist named ""Dr. Carrington"", was so annoying that I kept wanting to jump through the TV screen and strangle him!  He kept screwing things up for the crew with his ""know-it-all"" attitude.  Also, it was frequently difficult to understand what the actors were saying, owing to the fact that they frequently talked over one another!! (good thing this DVD came with subtitles).  The captain in the movie must have said the words ""Holy cats!"" about five-thousand times. (really silly!)  The picture itself is fairly clear, with not too many nicks and scratches. The only special feature on the disc is the trailer.  All in all, a rather disssapointing movie.  I can't understand what all the fuss is about concerning this film.

1139294,"Films based off video games are usually not that wonderful.  They either range from good (""Resident Evil,"" ""Silent Hill"") to mediocre (""Doom,"" ""Tomb Raider"") to awful (""House of the Dead,"" ""Bloodrayne"").  Director Xavier Gens' ""Hitman"" falls somewhere in between good and mediocre.  It's got solid action scenes and a great look, but not much direction or cohesion when it comes to the storyline.Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) was trained as a young boy by the Organization to kill when needed.  In Eastern Europe, he's hired to assassinate the Russian president, which he does successfully, only to see him reappear on the television with only a minor wound on his head.  With Interpol and the Russian military at his heels, he also has to deal with the Organization setting him up and trying to kill him as well as taking care of Nika (Olga Kurylenko), a girl who's being chased as well for similar reasons.I'm a fan of the ""Hitman"" games, mainly because its game play is different compared to others.  It's not a game where running and gunning is encouraged.  Instead, the focus is more on strategy and the different ways you can go about assassinating targets to make it look like it was either an accident or just a very clean shot.  Since the video game series is unique compared to others, I was hoping to say the same for the film.  Unfortunately, I could not, but that doesn't mean it was a terrible experience at all.The main problem I had with the film is that the plot was too complex.  After watching it twice, I still didn't quite grasp what was going on, who certain people were, and why some action scenes occurred (all about the Metro scene).  At one point, I would think I would understand what was going on only to be confused five minutes later.  Furthermore, the film is titled ""Hitman,"" but it could have also been ""Hitman and the Interpol Investigation"".  Too much time is devoted to the head of the investigation, Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott), when it should be focused more on 47, especially his background, and his relationship with Nika (which I never quite understood where that was going either).  Finally, there are too many characters in the story that are not needed or that could use some fleshing out (Agent Smith, Udre Belicoff).  They are crucial to the plot, but since the viewer doesn't know much about them, it never really makes sense what they are doing or how they are affecting everything.The acting was above par for this type of film.  When Timothy Olyphant was announced to play 47, I remember fan boys crying out against it.  Even though I would have preferred somebody else (not Vin Diesel though), he still did a fine job, but I wasn't that pleased on how the character acted in the film (I'll get to this later).  Dougray Scott, probably best known as the bad guy in ""Mission: Impossible II,"" was great as the Interpol agent.  Some of his scenes could have been cut to leave more room for 47's story, but he was still enjoyable and balanced out the film nicely with his demeanor compared to 47's.  Olga Kurylenko looks great, but her acting didn't do much for me.  Her chemistry with Olyphant was unconvincing and not truly believable.  Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond from ""LOST"") showed up and was wasted in his role as Udre Belicoff.  It was great to see him in something else, but the film never did anything with his character and it was disappointing.The film, directed by Xavier Gens, does have a great look about it.  The locations from the train station to a church to even a bathroom all look beautiful.  He also knows how to shoot action well and keeps the film moving at a brisk pace.If a film is called ""Hitman,"" people are probably going to watch just for the action, which is delivered in spades and is the highlight of the film.  They are all shot fine and do not contain any ""shaky-cam"" or quick cutting which was much appreciated by me, but they lacked something.  Many of the action sequences just seemed to happen for no reason either then to showcase some violence.  Unlike the ""Bourne"" films, where the action has a purpose, it's not really the case here.  Also, I stated earlier that the games pushed for more strategy than just blowing everything away.  In the film, it's the opposite way around and it eventually becomes a mindless action film.  I was praying to have a creative assassination played out in true ""Hitman"" style, but I never got that either.Finally, my biggest gripe with the film is how our main character, Agent 47, is written.  In the film, he has a range of emotions, which for me, was a problem.  In the game, he was always serious with a rare, but dark sense of humor.  He would seem surreal in the game and above being a human.  The film changes that and makes him more realistic and like any other individual that takes away his unique personality.  I wanted to see more brooding and less talking and smiling.Overall, ""Hitman"" is an above mediocre film based off a video game.  It doesn't do justice to the already amazing game and it's unfortunate.  Still, it packs a few solid action scenes, great cinematography, and some good acting.  If only the plot had been stronger and the character of 47 better written, this film would have been surprisingly awesome.",N/A

This video uses maybe two or three book camp-ish moves the rest is based mostly on modern dance, tae bo (kickboxing) and tai chi. There are three separate workouts.  None of them really give a good cardio or a good toning workout.  Put a couple of them together and it's decent, but not great.  The middle workout is the only one that uses hand weights.  There are several sections that are entirely too slow.  Mostly these involve learning a dance sequence or doing tai chi. The music is pretty cool; there are some drummers in the background, and the instructor is annoyingly chirpy.  I recommend the Crunch boot camp video instead which gives a better overall workout.",The Method - Cardio Boot Camp VHS
935692,"In order to enjoy ""The Perfect Man,"" you have to understand and be receptive to the fact that this is a teeny-bopper movie that is most likely geared toward an audience of 12-year-old girls. If you're okay with that, then you'll probably be able to enjoy this movie at least somewhat. However, if you're very anti-teen-movies, then you should probably sit this one out.Hilary Duff gets top billing in this film over costars Heather Locklear and Chris Noth. Duff plays Holly, a high school student who is forced to deal with a slightly flakey mother, Jean (Locklear). Every time one of Jean's relationships doesn't work out (which happens quite often), she packs up her two daughters and forces them to move across the country in search of a fresh start. Eventually Holly gets sick of all the moving and she decides to put a stop to things once her family gets settled in Brooklyn. With the help of her friend Amy (Vanessa Lengies) and Amy's uncle Ben (Noth), Holly invents a secret admirer for her mother in hopes of boosting her mom's confidence and keep the family grounded in one city for more than a couple of weeks. Holly has to resort to drastic measures to keep her scheme alive and protect Jean's happiness. To make matters more complicated, Holly soon discovers that Ben is actually a perfect match for her mother, but any chance of them getting together has been ruined because of Holly's lies and deception.There are some aspects of the film that really annoyed me. Locklear's character is incredibly wishy-washy and the movie failed to showcase her talents as an actress. Noth's character is charming, but it's a shame that he and Locklear only have about two minutes of screen time together. Also, Holly's seven-year-old sister Zoe is the freakiest little child on the planet and I cringed every time she popped up on the screen. Why did they have to cast such a creepy kid?!Overall, ""The Perfect Man"" is a cute little movie. It's not really a romantic comedy at all: it's more about a mother and daughter who help each other venture down a road of self-discovery and figure out what they really want out of life.",N/A

211109,"Matthau was a veteran actor and Clayburgh was a rising star in Hollywood when this movie was made. This is a lightweight comedy-drama. There is some great verbal sparring between the two and you expect the movie to put them in situations that can take advantage of it but unfortunately the plot is not up to the standard of the actors.Clayburgh plays the first woman to be appointed to the US Supreme Court. Mathhau is one of the current Justices, a crusty veteran who doesn't get along with anyone else. The plot calls for Clayburgh to beconservative and Matthau a liberal. This helps get the verbal sparring going early.Unfortunately the plot starts to bog down and is a disappointment after the initial promise shown. The writers create some sexual tension between the two as Clayburgh and Matthau's characters get to know each other and understand where the other is coming from, each develops a deeper appreciation of the other while still disagreeing with the other's viewpoint. Unfortunately this tension is never released as nothing ever happens between the two.The plot really starts to sag when we find out that Clayburgh's ex-husband's company is implicated in a case that casts aspersions on Clayburgh's professional ethics. There are some elements of the real-life Whitewater case so perhaps the writers ran out of ideas and borrowed from the headlines in the newspaper. In any case this subplot is very uninteresting and the movie ends leaving you feeling it could have been so much better.Still, its a movie worth watching if only for the first half.

599228,"Firstly, I have never seen this show before.  I saw in on Amazon for under $20 and I need a show.  I need a show with enough action to keep my attention on the tredmill every night, and preferably enough of a female element to interest my wife, so we have a show to watch together.  Alias meets both criteria, but only just barely.All my reviews are spoiler free, so I won't ruin the plot by giving it away, but seriously, 1/2 of all the episodes involve secret agent Sydney Bristow dressing up in a slinky outfit with a sexy hairdo to infiltrate a swanky party always being thrown in the same building as a secret base for her to break into and steal some item or artifact.  Apparently bad guys are quite fond of swanky parties and also can't get away from the ""office"" long enough to really enjoy them, so why not throw a party at the secret bad guy base?  Perfect!  Well maybe not.  Sure, I can appreciate Jennifer Garners mid driff and long sexy legs as much as the next guy, but after a while it feels like I'm watching a game of ""dress up"" when every other episode involves her dolling up in a new sexy dress.Mixed in with the action are ""daddy issues"", ""mommy issues"", friend issues, romance, long discussions worthy of daytime drama and a good dose of crying and hand wringing over Sydneys life foibles.  Fortunatly, my wife enjoys those parts too, so it gives us something to enjoy together, Alias has become ""our show"".There is too much violence and torture for my tastes.  Some things the bad guys (and some of the ""good guys"") do is just too graphic for the both of us.We bought the whole series and will watch it all eventually, but the main plot line is starting to feel too much like ""Lost"", which is a show I despise.  ""Lost"" is a snipe hunt.  After watching ""Lost"" for years, it has become clear that there is no underlying plot, its just a bunch of crap the writer thinks up over coffee that day.  If you remember Lost, there was a point where the story starting going off from reality (People stranded on an island trying to survive) to fantasy (smoke monsters, dead people flash backs, mystical powers, etc).  The first half of Alias season one is quasi reality (a female secret agent) and 1/2 way through gets mystical (500 year old prophesies, machines created by an ancient mystic prophet named Rambaldi who keeps coming up for reasons that are, by the end of Season 1, not at all explained) and part of it starts to feel silly.Overall the writing is passable.  There are a couple good scenes and a couple good plot twists.  In fact there are many plot twists, but most of them are blindingly obvious.  A lot of the time I can't tell if the writers are being serious or tounge-in-cheek as well.  One time they need to disarm some C4 plastic explosives.  It is ""hidden"" in a maintenance closet in big boxes with ""C4"" written all over it.  One character says, ""well I can tell its C4, because it has ""C4"" written all over it.""  Also, working in Network Admin (as I do) is a liability for enjoying some of the show, because I know that things don't work the way the writers think they do.  Wireless Modems don't steal data off hard disks just by putting them 4 inches away from a mainframe, for example...  Unfortunatly, there is quite a bit of this sillyness, but thats a common problem.In the end, each episode got me interested enough to watch the next, so its certainly worth the under $20 price, but I have no doubt that the whole underlying ""Rambaldi"" plot will not pan out to my satisfaction...",Alias - The Complete First Season
633967,"Some people seem to miss the point: It's a movie for the kids! So I'm not going to bash it for its inaccuracies, or for how corny it is. However, I will criticize it for its lack of originality. This has all been done before in other movies. It borrowed a lot from the movie ""Major Payne"" (a way superior movie) plus it had stuff from other movies like Mr. mom, and home alone. The characters in the movie also have no depth, they are very superficial. They were pretty much there just to be there. It's a movie you will watch and then never watch again. It is definitely a movie not too many adults are going to repeatedly watch. It just lacked ideas. However, it did make my son laugh several times. So from a kids perspective, I guess it's not all that bad, even though I didn't care for it.Side Note: I actually have a bone to pick with Disney: I am so sick of Disney's subjective censorship in their movies. They are hypocrites! Let me explain: I watched the new ""where the red fern grows"" and Disney took it upon itself to edit all the gun fire out of the movie (and it's a movie about hunting), they edited all the violence to the point that you have to rewind the movie a couple times to make heads are tales out of a bad editing scene where a boy dies. They also edited the violence out of the dog fighting with the mountain lion scene; it was so bad that it actually looks like a stuffed animal fight. So Disney likes to edit out any thing it finds ""questionable"" or ""offensive, YET IN THIS MOVIE, Disney found it ""ok"" to encourage children to fight, be violent, and setup traps that could actually kill someone. Disney also found it ""ok"" that this movie uses terms like ""boobs"" (repeatedly) and uses a wrestling move term called a ""nipple crippler"" these are terms taken straight from this movie. I'm not a conservative or a prude, as a matter of fact, I have a potty mouth, and I am an anti-censorship supporter. I just find Disney to be a little stupid and hypocritical when it comes to what they approve of in their movies.

It's obvious that it was intended to be quirky.

612998,"If you like watching kids running wilding in your room or playing footbal in your yard, then you will love &quot;Daddy Day Care.&quot;  This is not to imply any sarcasm.  The kids are in fact the most precious existence in this film, but is this not supposed to be an Eddie Murphy film, is it?Like his previous &quot;Pluto Nash&quot; disaster, Eddie is the least funny presence in this so-so comedy.  He is Charlie Hinton, who recently lost his job.  With his pal Jeff Garlin, he accidentally starts a day care center for kids, including his own named Ben.  His &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; center gets popular among the town, but the owner of posh preschool Chapman Academy, villainess Anjelica Huston (who hams it up like in &quot;The Addams Family&quot;), doesn't want them to be successful, and makes her sabotage plans.The film never avoids clithed moments, but that is not a big problem.  Director Steve Carr (previously working with Eddie in &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;) follows the formalua of family picture, and as this is a family picture, you don't need anything that might possibly offend adults or scare kids.  You should know that rule.But it is Eddie Murphy's film, and the problem is, anyone can play Charlie's role.  &quot;Nutty Professor&quot; clearly succeded owing to Eddie's tour-de-force performance, but no such magic here.  In other words, why Eddie?Having said that, I admit the film has good moments as some of the supports are wonderful.  One of them is underrated Steve Zahn, whose acting is funny enough to raise the film several notches higher even without now-clithed &quot;Star Trek&quot;-related gags.But the most wonderful are the kids; you might say your own kids are as cute as they are, and, right, but you cannot deny the charms of these fourteen kids.

904834,"This movie was made for TV, but still got on R rating on DVD.  This is probably because of the marijuana smoking the bad high school athlete does in the boys bathroom at one point.  Otherwise, even the violence doesn't have that Hollywood graphic detail.  The characters in this film display the sexual mores of, well, they don't.Tom Selleck is very good as Jesse Stone, the run down big city cop who brings his problems to be the chief of police in a small town where the duties are small and his foibles can be indulged without hurting anyone.  His best friend is Abby Taylor (Polly Shannon) and she is one of the best things in the movie.The movie opens with one of the town's few policemen finding a murdered corpse and a live dog.  As the movie progresses there are more murders and it becomes clear that these are the work of a serial killer.  Another plot involves a young schoolgirl who is raped whose mother wants the perpetrators punished, but everything kept confidential because of the shame her family would suffer in such a small town.  The girl caught between her family, the boys who did this to her, and just trying to survive her teenage years.  Jesse does his best to help her as does another policewoman, Molly Crane (Viola Davis).It is a decent movie, but just moves so slowly.  I guess that is to evoke the pace of a small town.  The music emphasizes how quiet and slow everything is as well.  Even at 87 minutes, the movie seems full length.  The performances are good, the story isn't special, but not bad.  Still it takes so much time to get things done.  I would love to have learned more about the personal lives of some of the minor characters and more background on Jesse.

However, in light of all of the mishandlng that has been done of this character for the purposes of presenting him to movie-going audiences, ""III"" stands as the best we have to select from... and that's sad!Yes, the other entries are more ""action packed"" and ""grittier,"" but they all to the letter treat the legend as a joke! The thing about ""Superman III"" is that the filmmakers here have dispensed with all the pretense and have ACKNOWLEDGED the joke and treat it as such, and in so doing they actually managed to give this movie more of a ""comic book"" feel for the time and made it feel (dare I say it) ""familiar.""But let's be clear, I still want to see an AWESOME full-lenth live-action rendition of the Superman character and mythos, but I want something more *INTELLIGENT* and involving in its handling (would somebody *PLEASE* take cues from DCAU DtDVD projects or ""Smallville""), rather than the vacuous pap we've been forced to swallow thus far. In the meantime, while all the big shot producers with no love for (or knowledge of) the character continue to try to figure out how to handle him and his world properly, I can take comfort that there's still this one stand-out entry that, while far from what it should be, I can actually watch not only with a smile but also find a deep and emotionally moving ""plot-driven"" story that makes me feel like maybe they were trying to lay the ground work, albeit in a lighthearted way, to make the telling of Superman's adventures more engaging and engrossing.",Superman 3 VHS

1283954,"Overall, a good movie that features some interesting history on the Hoover's ""G-men"" and crime in the 1930's during the Great Depression.  However, it missed the mark in telling and showing a captivating story, which is unfortunate.This isn't a family or date movie, unless you're into violence and lots of gun fire and dead bodies.The story follows the infamous bank robber John Dillinger and his gang through numerous bank jobs and escapes from lock-up. In contrast, the story also follows Hoover and his recruitment of a the new head of the Chicago FBI office, as they tighten the net on Dillinger.Obviously a great cast, set design, and wardrobe. Action scenes could have been better. Where this movie fell flat, is in the story. I wasn't captivated by either of the story's main characters. Sure, okay, they were interesting. But I wasn't drawn into their lives, like I should have been, especially with a story that has at its side, such rich history to pull from.And I'm not sure, how the directing pulled me into the story or characters either.Other then the historical aspect, I'm not sure I would buy this movie for my collection.",Public Enemies

1214852,"I've always been a fan of the movie but never saw the TV show, and when I noticed all the sterling reviews it was getting and found it at a great price, I picked it up.  Sadly, right away I could tell it was not going to appeal to me, and as I watched more episodes in hopes that it would get better, I found I was forming a litany of gripes with it.  The show is clearly a product of the 80s, signified by the cheap looking intro (where the ""dark"" world is shown by using a negative of an image) and the pedestrian picture quality.  The acting is horrid, with the majority of actors giving one-note performances, which might not be so bad if the show gave us compelling stories ... not so.Like the EC and 60's DC and Marvel horror comics I adore, many of the stories hinge on a final twist, and yet many of them don't handle this well, telegraphing the twist far too early (""If The Shoes Fit,"" ""Grandma's Last Wish,"" ""Anniversary Dinner"") or using a twist that doesn't make a lot of sense and so isn't earned (""Trick or Treat,"" ""The New Man"").  There are a few episodes that actually handle story and suspense well, such as ""Snip, Snip"" and ""The Madness Room,"" which despite their low-budget pedigree are on par with any Tales From The Crypt story, but these are subsumed by the overwhelmingly poorer episodes.  ""The False Prophet"" is the perfect example of an episode gone wrong, with an annoying one-note lead and a story that rips the best elements of the Twilight Zone episode ""Nick of Time"" and the ""Bishop of Battle"" segment fromNightmaresand creates a silly mash that ends all too predictably.Thankfully, the episodes are brief (about 21 minutes each), and so Paramount was able to fit the entire 24 episode season on 3 single-sided discs.  Because they were created for TV, all of the episodes are given a standard presentation instead of widescreen.  The DVD case is standard-sized, or the size of a regular DVD case, with a single leaf that holds 2 discs, the 3rd residing on the inner right side of the case.  The case is clear plastic and the artwork is double-sided, with the episode listing and a brief summary for each one printed inside.  All in all, the set is compact and nicely-packaged (I'm a big fan of clear DVD cases!).  My 3-star rating for this product comes from averaging 2 stars for the unintentionally cheesy show, and 4 stars for the packaging.No offense intended to the fans who grew up watching the show and those just getting into it.  I'm just looking to caution those who haven't seen it and are thinking about buying it - rent it first.  Also, I'd suggest instead getting any set of Tales From The Crypt as well as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, the newer Outer Limits, and the far superiorTales from the Darkside: The Movie.  Thanks for reading.",Tales from the Darkside: Season 1
337893,"I have to wonder if the people reviewing this Hammer interpretation of the Mummy watched the same film I did. I found this to be one of the lesser Hammer productions. Hammer began making some good looking horror films because the genre was getting tired and Universal was churning out low budget horror flicks for a quick buck. This version of the Mummy is not even on par with the 1940's Universal Mummy films which spanned four serial type horror sequels. Forget about the original film starring Karloff, it doesn't hold a candle to that moody,somber masterpiece!  Karloff's performance is creepy and Jack Pierce's make-up is absolutely incredible! Christopher Lee may have size but, he does nothing with the role of the undead protector of the tomb. Even though he does walk faster then the laughable Mummies from the 40's, it's not so fast that he could catch anyone. As slow as the Mummies were in those Universal 40's films there was a sense of relentless pursuit, normal people get tired mummies don't. I guess with thousands of years of sleep they can go for a long time! LOL! The brilliance of the 1932 classic with Karloff was that he was supernatural and he killed his enemies with curses! You can't run from that and it makes it all the scarier that there is no place to hide. I rate this film 2 1/2/ stars for some effort and seeing the Mummy in color. I hope the sequels are better than this one. It's just didn't add much new to the character.",N/A
969174,"Director Roger Kumble can't stop thinking about relationships.  First he gives us Cruel Intentions 1 & 2, then the Sweetest Thing, and now we have Just Friends, another movie about relationships gone awry.  If the first two films were about manipulating people for sex and the second was about manipulating them for love, this latest flick could be safely called a little of both.Penned by Adam ""Tex"" Davis (this is the first thing he's written for the screen, unless you count the Made-For-TV ""Spring Break Lawyer,"" which, uh, I don't), ""Just Friends"" is certainly having fun with itself, but it doesn't always have fun with the audience.  Poor Chris, a fat-but-loveable high school loser, professes his love for his best friend, Jamie, only to have her turn him down with a platonic kiss, planted firmly in that ""like a brother"" area located in the middle of his chubby cheek.  Ten years later, Chris has slimed down and toned up and now pursues and discards women with a personality that is as chiseled as his body.  Working as a sly music executive, he finds himself accidentally stranded in his native New Jersey (thanks to a jet plane/microwave mishap) with another chance to win the heart (or at least the body) of his long-lost childhood chum.Chris is played expertly by Ryan Reynolds doing what he does best: mixing wry attitude with well-acted emotion (his best scenes are when he's encased in rubber as the once-flabby Chris; Reynolds would do well to take more character roles, since he's starting to pigeonhole himself as The Witty Wiseacre).  Reynolds is surrounded by a group of equally able co-stars who are strong in each of their roles: Amy Smart as the trophy gal, Jamie; the wonderfully over-the-top Anna Faris as a Christina Aguilera wanna-be named Samantha James; and Chris Klein (who seems to be making fun of every other dull-as-dirt character he's ever played) as the doe-eyed rival, Dusty Dinkleman.  There are other notables here, too, including Stephen Root (Newsradio, Dodgeball) as Chris's boss and Julie Hagerty (Airplane!) as Chris's ditzy mother.Ms. Hagerty's presence makes a lot of sense, especially since this film borrows heavily from a lot of its comedic ancestors, which not only include Zucker and Abrahams, but also the Three Stooges (see: Chris's slap-heavy relationship with his younger brother -- the only thing that's missing there are ""nyuks"" and eye pokes) and the National Lampoon's series (see: the various pratfalls and even a humorously obliterated Christmas panorama).A lot of this is remarkably well done and truly funny stuff (for those fans of the style), but it also seems crammed together in a clumsy attempt to distract from the shallow and confused script.  You don't ask much from a movie like this, but you do expect a little heart, a little warmth, or -- more importantly -- a little sense.  Unfortunately, not much of this movie seems very relatable or plausible, which wouldn't be so bad if the film didn't pretend so hard that it was both.  As a result, Chris's pursuit of Jamie, although it is the main premise, actually feels tacked on, and both characters, in spite of their believability as real people, are still very hard to understand and connect with.Your best bet, if you watch this film, is just to watch it.  People get electrocuted, dropped off balconies, and very few groins are spared.  Reynolds hams it up, mugs with panache, and takes all of the abuse with classy straight-man style.  Even the final credits roll over a souped-up version of Samantha James' song, ""Forgiveness,"" a pretty funny send-up of bubble-gum pop (""To forgive is divine/so let's have a glass of wine/and have make-up sex/until the end of time"").  Ultimately, if you can remove yourself from the movie as much as it removes itself from you, you'll probably enjoy the experience.(This DVD comes with the usual voice-over commentary -- which is actually pretty banal considering the subject matter, some deleted scenes, a lot of stuff about the making-of -- including Ryan's transformation into a fat high school kid, a set of blooper clips -- always a favorite, and an alternate ending that is obviously alternate for a reason.  A good collection for those of you who like a lot of bonus material.  NOTE: some sites say that there are Easter Eggs on this disc, but I haven't found them.)",N/A
1673191,"Luc Besson&#8217;s latest movie &#8220;The Family&#8221; is typical example of a film where a wealth of great talent is wasted on the thin material. The film has a great cast of actors including Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Tommy Lee Jones, and Dianna Agron, some interesting characters and beautiful photography (by Thierry Arbogast), while striving to find a story to tell.Based on a book by Tonino Benacquista and co-executive-produced by Martin Scorsese, &#8220;The Family&#8221; (also known as &#8220;Malavita&#8221; meaning &#8220;Badfellas&#8221;) chronicles the life of a former mafia boss Giovanni Manzoni, now &#8220;Fred Blake,&#8221; and his wife Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and two children Belle (Dianna Agron) and Warren (John D'Leo) living in a quiet village in Normandy, France, under FBI witness protection plan. The American family has some run-ins with locals who do not know their true identity, despite the advice from FBI agent Robert Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones).&#8220;The Family&#8221; suffers from the inconsistent tone as a result of the lack of story. As a comedy it is too violent; as a gangster film it is too absurd (FBI and mafia in France?). Those violence-prone characters suddenly get weak during the shoot-out. Reference to one classic gangster movie (by Martin Scorsese) is mildly amusing, but not enough. The subplot about Belle and the math teacher goes nowhere.This is regrettable because the younger players Dianna Agron and John D'Leo are so good, almost stealing scenes from veterans. I wanted to know much more about their characters and how they dominate the school, than the clich&eacute;d culture clash episodes or tired and pointless &#8220;action.&#8221;",The Family
247590,"While I admire the cinematic beauty of ""Nights of Cabiria"" and even its plot (as threadbare as it is, it's still good fun), by the time Fellini got to Juliet of the Spirits, he had really run out of things to say. Early on in the movie, there are harbingers of a plot, some suspense and even something verging on high drama, but none of these pan out, and instead we are left with.......a mess.Giulietta Masina is a very great actress, it is just that there wasn't much material for her to work with. It is too bad she hitched her wagon to husband Fellini's star her entire career, because if she were just in a few movies with plots, character development and finely crafted dialogue, we could have discovered the full range of her talent.In 1965, when this movie came out, there weren't so many movies about a woman's ""midlife crisis"" and her quest for ""fulfillment""; By now this plot has become a cliche. As far as the story line goes, ""Juliet of the Spirits"" has got to rank among the worst, even losing out to the B-movies and straight-to-video films that are grist for the mill on Lifetime and The Oprah Channel.And that is really a shame, because this is one of the most gorgeously filmed movies I've ever seen. Director of Photography Gianni di Venanzo's use of Technicolor is breathtakingly fascinating for its sumptuous use of warmth and its balance of colors and use of shocking hues. It rivals movies such as ""Fantasia"" and ""Vertigo"" for its artistic *visual* excellence.Yet, this movie taken as a whole is rambling, unfocused and pretentious in a genre that is not too difficult to master. Some call Fellini's movies ""surrealistic,"" and I have no argument with that. Perhaps my bourgeoise temperament lacks the patience to put up with it in two-hour-long doses. I prefer my surrealism in visual stills from Dali, Man Ray, Magritte.The irony of it is that the best movie of the ""woman finding herself"" genre -- ""Shirley Valentine"", directed by Lewis Gilbert -- is filmed so dryly that it borders on incompetence. Imagine what a movie that would have made were the script put into the hands of di Venanzo and Fellini with a soundtrack by the great Nino Rota.Altogether, viewing ""Juliet of the Spirits"" can be a pleasant experience, so long as one is concerned with camera work, editing, color timing and music.",N/A
400762,"1943's THE DESPERADOES opens with a bang, as the Clanton Bank in Red Valley, Utah gets robbed by several bandits with dynamite. They're angered to find nothing in the safe, and we soon find out why - banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) himself, in cahoots with the town's postmaster and stable boss Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) have taken the money themselves - though they also planned the robbery as a diversion. They pay off the robbers led by Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell), but there's been a hitch, as three townspeople were killed in the robbery - which was supposed to be bloodless? They'll have to find someone to pin the dirty deed on, as the sherrif is Steve Upton - Randolph Scott - and we know he won't rest until the killers are found.But Steve's got his own problems - his horse gets stolen from him by a bandit (Glenn Ford) who gets the drop on him - and he soon finds out that the bandit is none other than Cheyenne Rogers, aka Bill Smith, his old friend from Wyoming days past. Unfortunately Cheyenne has a price on his head - and it turns out, he was the guy who Uncle Willie was originally going to have pull the bank job until Clanton got tired of waiting for the delayed Cheyenne to show up. Now Cheyenne has to wait in town while his friend Nitro ('Big Boy' Williams) heals up after breaking his foot; stay away from Clanton and the bandits who want to put him in jail; romance Uncle Willie's daughter Allison (Evelyn Keyes), and argue with the (rather superfluous) Countess (Claire Trevor). Eventually of course his friendship with the Sheriff will be tested, there'll be drama involving the women, and showdowns will have to occur.This was a big-budget, prestige affair, a solidly ""A"" western with a top-flight cast, and Columbia's first film in Technicolor. Much of it was shot on location, and a horse stampede through town at the climax, and a truly spectacular and lengthy barroom brawl that basically destroys a large saloon show that the money is on the screen. Unfortunately, the too-large cast of not-well-developed characters, fairly dull and faceless villains, and the rather over-the-top humor (especially in the presence of 'Big Boy') take away what drama the story might have had and make this a fairly average, just watchable affair all around. I liked the character of Uncle Willie, a really gray and conflicted person, and I think Buchanan probably gives the best performance in the film - but there's too much emphasis on playing him for laughs when there is some real pathos in the character; there's a great scene where he's talking to his daughter in the stable as she's about to leave, and he mentions how this is what always happens when a kid grows up - beautifully done stuff, but the film ends up relying too much on slapstick and broad strokes, when there's a better and more serious story buried there itching to get out.  I'm not sure director Charles Vidor had a whole lot of sympathy for the genre either; there's very little feeling for the landscape or the frontier mentality here.Still the color, the action and characters make this worth a look - if not probably many rewatches.  I could almost give this another star, but I really think that this film suffers in comparison with some of Scott's better westerns of this period - notablyWestern Unionfrom a couple of years earlier - and is probably not going to have very wide appeal to any but the most devoted fans of the actors and westerns from this period.  Scott's 50s westerns are just about all worth watching and rewatching - some of his 40s work doesn't quite cut the mustard, and this is a typical example from an era when the genre was still trying to figure out how to go from the low-budget kiddie fare that exemplified the 1930s, to the much more serious films that make up the best examples of the 1950s.",N/A

For those of us who grew up with ""The Lone Ranger"" the movie was written as an obvious betrayal of these characters. Rather as serious subjects, The Lone Ranger and Tonto became the center of a farcical/action/comedy that demeaned the entire story line and left one bitter and confused.I swore I'd never look at this movie again but after a month or so I watched it once more in the vein it was written and found myself not as hostel and even enjoyed parts of it knowing what to and what not to expect.

1506311,I give credit to the crew that made this movie as they tried to stay as faithful to the JC universe as they could.I felt they needed to flesh out the characters better and make them more interesting.  It was difficult to tell one from the other.  Other than the lead character we never got to know them and never cared if they lived or died.  In JC's version you knew who was who even with the limited time each character had.The CGI also wasn't the greatest but the 1982 version puppets doesn't hold up well today so CGI is where we are at.  Unfortunately this movie didn't have a Lord Of The Rings type of budget to make that CGI look real.Overall it's a nice little companion piece to JC's movie.

Although Marilyn got top billing, she's clearly out-performed by both Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable.Let me, for a brief moment talk about the ""Diamond Collection"" version of How To Marry A Millionaire.  When you think of remastering, especially older films made on Cineascope or Technicolor, you think of rich, vibrant-colored stories in particular the Rogers and Hammerstein collection.  Excellent.  You, especially, think of the remastered Disney Collection.  Excellent.  Both of which, were competing genres at the time Marilyn was making a name for herself.  You might even throw the remastered ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1937) in the fray.  And yet, this ""Diamond Collection"" is barely passable as a DVD version.  This isn't a distinct restoration.  The images, even in the special feature section ""Restoration Comparison"" shows how little the previous version and the film version hasn't had much improvement with this collection.  Don't get me wrong, the sound reproduction is superb, but this is comedy and a lot depends on visuals.Recently, I started to repurchase the Disney collection-- their ""Platinum 2-disc"" set.  Cinderella, Peter Pan.  And, there is a profound difference between the last version and this deluxe version.  The Sound of Music, the same thing.This isn't to say, it's not worth watching, but there's little to no improvement in picture quality.

709856,"While the actual films themselves look stunning on blu-ray, this review shall address the packaging.  Seriously, if I would have known in advance that Universal was releasing this collection in such disgustingly ridiculous packaging, I would have held out for the single disc releases.  I tend to go for packaged collections so this one seemed to be a no-brainer.  I literally sat and stared at the disc trays for a good 2 or 3 minutes studying them, waiting on that ""ohhhh I get it"" moment, and the discs would just come out of the trays with no problem. Boy was I wrong.  I seriously thought I was doing something wrong.  The trays do not have the standard hubs we are all used to.  The discs are held in place with these ridiculous plastic clips across the bottom and you literally have to pull the disc to one side while simultaneously bending the tray so the disc will pop out. Every time I open the box I start to get even more angry because I know what I'm in for and it takes tooooooo darn long to get the discs out.  It is THE biggest pain in the a$$.  On top of the disc trays being ludicrous, the overall packaging, slipcase, etc. looks and feels cheap. TOTAL FAIL on the packaging.  I will more than likely post my set on eBay. Universal should slap the fools that ok'd the packaging for this release.

1598986,"I like the premice, a radio talk show host talking about gay culture with ""the players"" of Chicago's gay crowd. They actually used the real deal ""players"" from the community.This film actually portrayed some redeeming thoughts! It talks about the 10% of the gay population that everyone sees, and perceives as the ""stereotypical"" gay person, as well as the hidden gay population, like the guys that just go to work and don't wear their sexual orientation as a badge of honor or difference to society.It also sheds light on the ""straight"" guys who enjoy fooling around, in the gym showers or at an adult theater, maybe they're not so straight...As the film introduces each of the guests, there is an extended video montage of their works. These montages are great for the graphic nudity, sexual situations and eye candy!Stuff I didn't like about the film...This DVD turns into a preview of other Toby Ross, Hornbill, BDF films, complete with not so subliminal product placements...While I am not a video producer, and the quality is certainly better than I could do, I think you need some constructive feedback. Maybe those close to you, are too close to criticize your work.This production group needs guidance with lighting, lots of hot spots in just about every scene. This production group needs guidance with audio, too much variation with the sound, in one scene shots from one angle are loud, and from another are soft. Audio throughout fluctuates greatly from scene to scene. This production group needs guidance with editing and continuity, several very rough cuts, with inappropriate frames between. A sleeveless arm from a man (wearing a jacket) is seen in a close up as he reaches toward another character. This production group needs guidance with acting, quit reading your lines, memorize them and live them! Give the actors the freedom to become their characters and talk in a dialect that is natural for them, you don't need to read the script verbatim.Like the DVD ""Justin, A Gift from the Gods"" most of the hot, nude, sexual footage, is reused and recycled (some editing room floor footage from other films, recognizable to Toby Ross followers) from other previous productions and just spliced in to juice up the film.Overall, there is something special about Hornbill, BDF, and Toby Ross films, as long as they're still producing them, I'm still buying them!",Homosexual

Anti-hero Russell Crowe - now looking podgy for some reason (ala State of Play) - actually looks a little unhinged or deranged in this film while taking on the mission of a lifetime.  He's convincing in many ways, but the film might have worked better without a celebrity.  Having Russell in the driver's seat detracted from the suspense.  Maybe he's too familiar to us.  (Interesting that Amazon lists Liam Neeson's films alongside this - both Taken and Unknown are riveting - and Liam makes a cameo here, almost blowing away Russell Crowe IMHO).To the film's credit, we never quite know where it's heading - will he make it?

1653413,"PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES is not really a good film, yet despite its problems, it is intriguing, weird and quite entertaining.Some viewers have described the picture as ""a redneck version of PULP FICTION,"" but I think that's a stretch.  Essentially, the movie consists of three unconnected stories, told separately yet all supposedly taking place at the same time, that lightly intersect along the way.  What they do have in common is that, for the most part, they all begin at a rural Louisiana pawnshop run by Vincent D'Onofrio.In one story, a trio of goofy white-supremacist drug addicts decides to rob a meth lab, but the plan goes awry when one of them (Lukas Haas) pawns their only gun in order to buy enough gas to get there.A second, much darker tale begins when a newlywed (Matt Dillon) discovers a unique ring in the pawnshop that belonged to his first wife who disappeared six years earlier, sending him on a violence-filled search to find her.The final story concerns a down on his luck Elvis Presley impersonator (Brendan Fraser), who makes a life-changing decision when he comes to a small town to play the local fair.Written by Adam Minarovich and directed by Wayne Kramer, PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES contains a number of ethereal elements that are never satisfactorily resolved.  Indeed, expanded, each of the three stories has a strong enough premise that they would probably have worked as a separate film.  Having them ""touch shoulders"" in this movie seems like a forced effort.The cast, when you can decipher their Southern dialects, is first-rate.  They include Elijah Wood, Thomas Jane, Norman Reedus, Pell James, Chi McBride and Paul Walker.PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES is available via Anchor Bay Entertainment in both a Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack and as a separate DVD.  The sole extra is audio commentary by the writer and director. Michael B. Druxman",N/A

618135,"It's pretty obvious that ""Brother Bear' would be nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature, because it was made by Disney. But I don't feel that it complety deserves it. Having seem all the nominees for that category, I feel that ""Brother Bear"" is my third choice for the Oscar, but that does not stop it from being a fun time at the movies. It has the voice talents of Joaquin Phoenix, and Micheal Clarke Duncan, and it is good for kids as it is for adults.The story is about Kenai, Denahi, and Sitka. They are three brothers in prehistoric times,where mammoths rule the world. The youngest of the three is Kenai, whose is ready to recieve his totem, a symbol that will lead him for the rest of his life. But when the villiage shaman Tanana gives him the totem of love he is very disappointed. But he goes on a journey when a bear takes a basket of fish that he was supposed to guard. While finding it, he has an encounter with a giant bear. His other two brothers find Kenai, but while trying to stop the bear, Sitka ends up dying. Kenai wants his revenge, and he goes on a mission to destroy the bear. But the ghost of Sitka wants Kenai to live to his totem, and he turns him into a bear. Thr problem is that Denahi thinks that the bear not only killed Sitka, but also Kenai, and he looks for revenge.Kenai learns that he will have to go to where the light touches the Earth to talk about him being a bear with Sitka. He goes a journey and meets Koda, a young bear cub, who was seprated from his mother when hunters attacked them. He also meets two moose named Rutt and Tuck. Kenai does not want Koda to hang around with him, but when he learns that Koda knows where the light touches the Earth, he decides to let him stick around. Throughout his journey, he learns more about what it is like to be a bear, and what Sitka wanted him to learn. This all leads up to a tragic discovery, and the problem with Danahi, and how he following them, looking for revenge.""Brother Bear"" was a fun, quick, time at the movies, but if your looking for a better animated film either rent ""Finding Nemo"" or see ""The Triplets of Belleville."" It was funny and sweet, but its problem is that it is a regular Disney movie. It's has similiar qualites to ""Bambi"" and ""Dumbo"" and even ""Finding Nemo."" I only wish that Disney would start getting a new story idea. It's more of a rental movie instead of seeing it in the theatre. I liked how it is done with drawn animation instead of complete computer animation, and this is one of the last. ""Brother Bear"" was not an Oscar award film.ENJOY!Rated G",N/A
1124518,"I'll start off by saying that I found this film more engrossing than it's Best Picture rival No Country For Old Men, and that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our generation.  When he plays a role, HE IS the role.  I just love the way he pulls off that early 20th century look with the hairstyle, the mustache, and the trousers.  Truly amazing, he pulls it off to perfection.  The characters, the setting, and the scenery were quite exceptional and enjoyable.  The only reason TWBB is better for me than NCFOM is simply because there is much better acting and dialogue in this film hands down.  The film is also a period piece and helps the viewer relate a bit better to the characters and what type of environment they have around them.  For example, the scene where the supposed brother of Daniel Plainview is waiting by his house.  I think we all know who it is and why he's there even before he properly introduces himself to Daniel.  The man is dirt poor, and Daniel has just struck it rich.  Whether it was his brother, a relative, or an old friend, you know exactly that the both of them shared a past and that they are both meeting not by chance, but for opportunity.However in my honest opinion, both these afformentioned films don't seem to have a clear and decisive plot and above all else, a satisfactory conclusion to the story.  As excited as I was to see the great Daniel Day-Lewis on screen again, I cannot say the same for the film which is quite slow at times in delivering a particular scene and leaves you with an empty feeling afterwards.  The only true satisfaction I got (regarding the story) was finally seeing H.W. Plainview release himself from his father's control on his life.  It is a painful scene, but it's brilliant and was long overdue in the film.  The dialouge between characters was great, especially the lack of actual spoken dialogue between Daniel and his son towards the end of the film.  The grimaces, the smiles, the sarcasm, and the stares between Daniel and Eli Sunday were striking.Aside from all that, it pains me to say this, but again, I think the book and the film take another stab at God and at organized religion.  Now I may be reading too much into that, but when you think about it, most of the movie deals with God, religion, salvation, and conscience.  As a semi-religous person myself, I did not find a problem with the stab, I just found a problem with who in the end was right and who in the end was wrong.  Both characters when you look at it were villains.  Despicable people truly void of God or a conscience.  Eli was a self-righteous preacher who was in it for the money.  Daniel was an egotistical maniac who was in it for the money, the power, and the glory.  Not to mention he plays a horrible father figure to H.W.  So at the end of the film, are we to take away that a bigger ego defeated a smaller one, or that capitalism, greed, and self-righteousness conquers over God?  The ending leaves too much to be desired and doesn't present a strong enough conclusion to both protagonists.While I think it was merely a coincidence that NCFOM and TWBB were filmed in the same fashion, my only hope is that future films with such great capacity can successfully have a proper conclusion to the story and can no longer void itself of complete justice towards sociopathic villians like Daniel Plainview and Anton Chigurh.",There Will Be Blood

761492,"You can tell how bad the DVD is of this film; the website for which I am doing this review does not even list this title on DVD anymore.  No question, it is a terrible DVD transfer.  I am giving this three stars because it's a great film.  The screenplay is by none other than Walter Hill and one of the two leads, Robert Culp, directed--as far as I know, his only feature film directorial effort (he did direct a number of TV show episodes, different shows).This is a tough as nails noir film with Culp and Bill Cosby as two cynical PIs who get mixed up in a money laundering caper to the tune of 400 grand from a prior bank heist.  Also involved are a slick crime boss and his henchmen--one of them is played by a very young Michael Moriarty--and, echoing Chandler, an effeminate lawyer, as well as the cops.  The main two of that group are Vincent Gardenia, Sgt. Papadakis, and another early appearance, this time by James Woods at Lt. Wyatt.But the two title characters carry the film and they do a great job.  The dialogue is razor sharp and probably the most cynical in any film from the 70s, and maybe even since then.  These two guys are so jaded and emotionally hollowed out that when a tragic loss hits one of them, the other one engages in semi-banter to cheer the first guy up, not even offering any sympathy.Each of them carries an extra-long barrel revolver; each of them always wears a suit.  Boggs (Culp) drinks too much.  Each of them is divorced, but Hickey has dreams of getting back together with his wife while Boggs watches his ex dance in a strip club.As a writer, Walter Hill is almost always great and here he shows his stuff to the max.  Hill knows his noir; he smacks the viewer in the face with it, knowing just how far to go without being completely alienating.  He's a master screenwriter, no question.It's really too bad that the DVD quality of this film is so miserable.  Maybe one day a clean crisp transfer will be available.  Until then, as many others here have said, the VHS copy actually shows better video quality than the crappy DVD.  Shame on AIP for putting out such a piece of trash for such a punchy film.",N/A
1185993,"I can understand, and do truly empathize with the people here who purchased the individual season-by-season packs of this show. There is an unspoken and unofficial understanding between consumers and DVD companies that if they release these season-by-season packs, then they will do it completely, and usually also release a full boxed set once the run is complete for those who didn't buy the individuals. HIT chose not to go that way, and that sucks big time. However, that said, the discs in this set are great. There is ample bonus material, and they didn't leave anything out. However, I also echo some consumer complaints here about the packaging. These kinds of packaging schemes are very annoying, and this one is near the top in annoyance factor. The way it is, you can't really set it in a library in any good way. The front is just a plastic inset that fits inside the box, so if you stand it up to face out, that plastic feels really loose. So, ditch the box you say? Well, not really, since the binder that the DVDs are actually in has an odd moulded shape to it, and wouldn't ""feel"" right just laying around naked and alone. Another case of the art/marketing department run amok, with no real sense for practicality. It actually kind of makes you not want to get them out and watch them, because it's such a hassle. Bad form HIT. That and the cardboard sleeves (as others have said) have a bad habit of letting the DVDs just slip out and rattle around. On second thought, I was going to give this 4 stars, but after writing this I'm changing it to 3.

But that's about all that is good about this film. The depiction of the Poles is one dimensional and Magdalena Mielcarz acting is very flat, although she is beautiful. The love story is strange, and only about the love scenes and the characters are so obsessive as to not make the story interesting. The depiction of Jews is at best, racist, and is a disgrace to modern movies.  The fight scenes are boring and gory and when *spoiler alert* all of the main cossack heroes die, they die pouring out their love for the great mother Russia, which is laughable. The torture scenes were excessive, the love scenes unnecessary and overall the film did not deliver.

956731,"An original story and extremely inspired acting creates an enjoyable movie experience, but the slow pace and lack of sympathy for the characters detracts.Tom Wilkinson is great as James Manning, a London businessman who discovers that his wife (Emily Watson) has been cheating on him with a younger apathetic businessman (Rupert Everert). When a mysterious hit and run accident kills the Manning's maid's husband, James is forced to make the decision to lie to protect his unfaithful wife, or to reveal the truth.Separate Lies is a well-crafted statement on the idea of honesty, decency, and deception, and when one is perhaps more appropriate than the other. Maybe lies protect us for a while, but perhaps painful experiences lead us to acceptance and reality. Although, by the end of the film, it's a bit confusing as to which way the writer-director seems to be leaning on the subject.Tom Wilkinson and Rupert Everett deliver superb performances, but Emily Watson's seems to stumble around a bit. It may just be that her character is flaky, but a few of her acting choices are a little shaky. The only special feature on the DVD is a feature length commentary by the director.",N/A

There are brilliant moments that linger in your mind well after leaving the theater. The casting seems fine. I've not heard whatever complaints there were from the fanboys, if any. The screenplay is flawed. Though, I have no idea how it could have been better and still remained as dedicated to the source material. Couldn't things have moved along at a better pace (for non-fans too)? Well, for my part, well over an hour-maybe hour and a half- into this and it still felt like things were just starting. As for the plot, it's absurd. There are maybe one or two maybe three ""good guys"" but they can't make a difference, can they? And they all have problems.

256992,"Ah, here we finally have the first FRIDAY THE 13TH that isn't in a campground, and that alone makes this a change of pace. However, just because the scenery has changed doesn't make things any better. Now we're headed to the Big Apple, where Jason is about to make his presence known by everyone. Does he make it big in the Big Apple?A group of students and some teaching staff are headed on a cruise ship for a little lax and leisure while the big finals are looming close. There are those meddling kids, but then there's Jensen Daggett, who's actually one of the better leads since Tina in the seventh FRIDAY. We also find our masked maniac at the bottom of the lake, where Tina sent him back, resurrected by an electrical underwater cable. Once again, Jason has been brought back to life and he's decided to stow away on board a cruise ship...with an appetite to kill again. Rennie (Daggett) is trying to keep with him, and while Jason does have a few creative killings (did you like the sauna killing?), most of them are nearly blood-free, which makes the impact of the killings a lot less gruesome, and that kind of takes the fun out of Jason killing anyone. The one scene I'm sure some will laugh at and some will raise eyebrows to is the scene where one girl presents her biology presentation very scantily clad, with thong and bra and skeleton parts drawn on her. She tries to make out with the teacher, but ultimately he knows her motives are more about trying to get an 'A' from her ""effort"" than from any real schoolwork. It makes a very amusing scene, but she adds some sexy appeal to it. But this is Jason's time, and no one's going to stand in his way. By the time he's bored of the cruise and decides to pursue a band of surivors on the streets of good ole New York City, things start to get interesting again. That's where we find a rather subdued climax, and it left the door open to if the series was finally dead, or if it would take a different turn, now that Jason's been stopped in the big city.While still entertaining and enjoyable for the most part, the lack of blood and gore and stale humor tends to weigh down this film. JASON TAKES MANHATTAN remains the weakest entry in the Friday the 13th series, but if you're a fan of Jason and the series, no doubt you won't pass this up.

Sutherland is killed and the turncoat crew member escapes with the gold, nearly killing his teammates in the process.Flash forward, a year later. The turncoat is rich and Wahlberg has found him living in L.A.. Wahlberg assembles his original team to go after the turncoat, even enlisting the help of Sutherland's daughter who is a beautiful Mini-Cooper-driving safe-cracker(!). ""It's not about the gold! It's about payback!"", the movie boldly states although I wonder if there was no gold involved and it sunk with Charlie Croker's almost-doomed crew, whether they would go after the punk.This movie is like that small box of chocolates you get from your other half instead of the large box. It goes down easy and doesn't make you feel like you've overeaten. As sleek as the Mini-Coopers that coast through the sewers of L.A., this is a summer action picture with the works. It's as techno-horny as the two ""Mission: Impossible"" films, though less serious and as fast and furious as...well...the Fast and the Furious and even Gone in 60 Seconds. Though, it's less goofy and with a slicker and smarter plotline.A who-who's of young Hollywood talent is the main reason to see this movie. Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie, Ed Norton as the unpredictable Steve, Seth Green is the computer-hacking ""Napster"", Jason Statham is ""Handsome Rob"", the wheelman, Mos Def is surprisingly good as ""Left Ear"", the explosives man, and Charlize Theron rounds out the cast as Stella the Safecracker, the daughter of Donnie Sutherland's character, John Bridger (in a nice homage to the original Charlie Croker, played by Michael Caine in the 1969 film).I almost would have preferred that this film could have been a remake/sequel in which Sutherland was playing the elder Croker and Theron was the next-generation Croker (The beginning of the film feels like the veteran is handing the ball to the rookie) but, alas, Mark Wahlberg takes the reins and the film works on its own as a fine ""heist-the-loot-and-run"" ride.The script is witty and good fun.

Most commentaries were over the animation and dialogue.Having watched the movie now, I can see where they are coming from.From where I sit, Rise of the Technovore is a standard, mediocre anime with a Marvel character, covering and flavor to it.It's a decent enough anime style if you don't mind how white washed it will be. The lines are rather rote and forced at times. If it didn't have the Marvel name and Iron Man attached to it, this would be one of thousands of animes that's out there and is quickly forgotten because it looks like all of the rest with this technological monster going to destroy the world, tentacles sprouting from it and the hero comes in with everything at dire odds and impossible to win the day yet he does so.I can see why there are complaints of Punisher's appearance and cameo in this movie being so lack luster. And then Hawkeye and Blackwidow weren't much better off either.If you look at this as standard anime fare, this is okay, watch it once and forget it. Move on to the next anime in the pile to watch.But that this has the Marvel name and characters attached to it and the newest Marvel dvd movie out since the end of the MLG Productions and Lionsgate contract and the whole Disney now owns Marvel. People have a right to be upset. I'm glad we have a new dvd movie and that there's a promise of more Marvel Animated movies coming. But more could have been done. The animators could have done better.Take a page from DC and WB and actually take some comic lines and adapt them to animation like they have.

Come to think of it, his performance in this movie is pretty much a carbon-copy of his role in ""Birth,"" with that I-know-something-about-you blank stare of his that seems to be becoming his trademark acting style.All in all, ""Ultraviolet"" isn't a bad movie, nor is it a particularly good one either. But its eye candy makes up for what it lacks in a plot and characters one can care about. Worth seeing on the big screen, but at a matinee price.",N/A

When I first saw this movie it held my attention and I thought about it for days.  Seeing it again, I recall that I never had emotional or intellectual closure. It's meaning escaped me and the subtext was unsettling. I was not enlightened about life but only allowed to share a dream where life is unpredictable, has no meaning and the attempt to seek answers is the first step in one's eventual downfall.  Pretty cold servings to digest (hence the title?).  Still, this singularly bizarre tale from 1979 is worth seeing.

1284306,"In the Sci-Fi/thriller/horror genre, this film is sort of a diamond in the rough as I think this movie's theatrical debut was much overlooked. Kind of reminded me of ""Event Horizon"" (1997), though I can see where the movie also borrowed from ""The Matrix"" (1999) in the development of the ""sleeping capsules"" and tube-style feeding machines, and the creatures looked very similar to those in ""The Descent"" (2005) but with technology adaptations. That's okay though, most movies borrow from each other anyway.I give it 3-stars because the movie was rather slow-going in the beginning and it didn't really gain my interest until we were about in the last third of the film. This is one you have to sit through to get the pay-off at the end of the film. Plus, I have seen my fair share of ""the last remaining humans"" fighting for humanity and attempting to destroy the creatures that threaten humanity, so the whole middle third of the movie which dealt with that theme and was little more than an action film something like ""The Blade"" (1998) didn't really interest me. Though perhaps if you haven't seen as many films as I have, you might find it unique or enjoyable.However, the last third of the movie was quite entertaining and really makes it worth watching the film. There are a couple of twists at the end, no spoilers here, watch it for yourself!Final Grade: B-",Pandorum

661218,"This 77 minute documentary film is interesting.  It takes us on a tour through Ireland, Scotland, England and Cape Breton where we meet several people who share their experiences, visions, sightings and folk stories regarding fairies.  The people we meet are all charming and the scenery in these locations where faery lore is abundant is equally charming.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It was like visiting with my Nana and Grandpa and hearing their tales of the faery realm.  I felt comforted by the honest matter-of-fact way they shared their feelings, ideas and experiences.  They weren't the least bit worried that they might seem far-fetched or unbelievable because in these countries there is healthy respect for the fey.  I enjoyed experiencing that openness and credibility.  I would tell anyone with an interest in faeries or the Celtic world or in magic to check this documentary out.  The reason I only give it three stars is that I didn't feel it was far-reaching enough. It really didn't knock me over in any way.  I would have been happy as can be to have come across it while channel surfing.  I would have certainly considered it a good program and worth the 77 minutes spent viewing it, though some of it was a bit on the dull side.  However, to order it and pay over...for it was too much.  It doesn't contain anything that any student of faery lore hasn't heard a hundred times.  It isn't a film I would watch again because I got the good of it from the one viewing and it's not profound enough or enlightening enough to warrant repeated viewings. If you can rent it or borrow it from a friend, by all means do so, but you can spend...more productively on other faery information or maybe start an account and save up to visit the Celtic countries personally where you can talk to the people and maybe experience the fey yourself.",The Fairy Faith VHS

1097558,"Driftwood (Tim Sullivan, 2006)Sullivan (2001 Maniacs) actually had a lot of potential with this script, co-written with Chris Kobin; it's a supernatural-themed mystery set in the Florida swamplands. Potential being the key word, as some bad casting choices and a lack of one more tightening rewrite leave the finished product feeling somewhat bland.David Forrester (Phil of the Future's Raviv Ullman) is sent to an ""attitude adjustment facility"" housed in an abandoned prison by his parents after the death of his brother (The Rules of Attraction's Russell Sams). Said facility is run by a trio of demented individuals. There's the warden, Kennedy (pro wrestler Diamond Dallas Page), his sadistic right-hand man Norris (Sex and the City's David Eigenberg), and a psychologist (Seabiscuit's Lou Beatty, Jr.) who provides hard evidence for the idea that all psychologists are in desperate need of help themselves. Then there are the kids in David's block, who range from a quiet, friendly kid sent there to cure his homosexuality to a twitchy school shooter. David, like his fellow inmates, is put to work clearing the grounds and doing gardening at the warden's place. No one complains much thanks to Myra (Frostbite's Baelyn Neff), Kennedy's gorgeous daughter, who seems to take a shine to David. David soon finds that the place is haunted, and eventually comes to realize that he--and the guys who are fast becoming his friends--may never leave the facility alive unless he figures out what the ghost wants from him.So much potential. So very much. But running another set of eyes over the script would have been a great idea. Someone might have caught a really nasty inconsistency in Myra's character, not to mention a few plot threads and pieces of character-building that could have been built on to make this a much more solid film. In fact, prison dramas of this style often turn on the relationships between the prisoners themselves. We get a little of that, but not nearly enough for us to get to know most of the inmates. We could have gotten it, and it would have made this a much better film. But the big failing here, which somehow doesn't surprise me in the least, is Dallas Page. He comes off as a sort of cross between a pro wrestler (that's a stretch) and a demented drill sergeant. He's got one emotion, and he works it to its last nerve, and far beyond. (This does provide some opportunities for--possibly intentional--humor, such as an interrupted love scene with his boss.) Still, despite all its shortcomings, the strength of the premise, as well as some hints of what this movie could have been, should be enough to get you to watch it if your taste for the macabre runs more to the atmospheric than the gore-drenched. ** ",N/A
337946,"It's Alive (Larry Cohen, 1973)What is there to say about It's Alive that hasn't already been said? Cohen (Air Force One: The Final Mission)'s fourth film is one of the most popular and enduring cult films of all time. It's a touching story about the bond between a father and his psychotic, murderous infant.Frank (The Postman Always Rings Twice's John Ryan) and Lenore (Night of the Comet's Sharon Farrell) Davies are expecting their first child, and as we open, the blessed event is about to take place. When Lenore gives birth, however, the child is deformed. And hungry. And has a thing for human blood. The rest of the film concerns Frank and the police trying to track the infant as it leaves a trail of bodies through suburban Los Angeles.With a Bernard Hermann score and Rick Baker effects, you know this ain't Rosemary's Baby. Cohen was going for the gut from moment one, as usual, and everyone involved in the production was right on board with that idea. This is melodrama with just enough gore to keep seventies-era gorehounds happy. These days, the big plot twist at the end is going to look like a clich&eacute;, but it wasn't all that normal back in the day. (It does, however, reference an obvious film that had been released a few years back; which one will be obvious if you go back and re-read this review so far.)

777677,"Its difficult to judge this season of Buffy. After all it had all the hallmarks of being one of the best. There was multiple main character deaths, plenty of original storylines, an interesting villian. It really had promise. And yet...it didnt quite hit the mark.For some reason the soul seemed to vanish with this season. This may have been intentional on the creators part, but for some reason this viewer was left a little cold.For starters the character of Buffy became even more unlikeable for me. Her death brought about a kind of vacuousness that was only ever so slightly present before. Xander, once a wonderful and funny character, began his slow descent into nothingness. Dawn continued her pointless presence. And Willows so called increased power just seemed rushed and out of place(though admittedly quite cool towards the end).The one saving grace for me, as it has always been, is Spike. His character has always remained fresh and interesting. Even in this season where he endures countless acts of humilation at the hand of a very heartless Buffy, Spike retains his dignity. (This is disregarding the episode of ""Seeing Red"", which I have since learned was nothing but a last minute ploy to get Spikes character out of Sunnydale and into a new soul.)Of course this season had its highlights. ""Once More With Feeling"" is an amazing triumph. The songs are wonderful and brilliantly sung by the cast. I enjoyed Amber Bensons contribution most of all. I also like ""Wrecked"" and ""Smashed"" if only for the gratuitous nudity of a certain Mr. James Marsters;-}""The Body"" has a kind of eery powerful charm that leaves the viewer very unsettled. And the final two episodes are memorable, particulary for the dialogue between Willow and Buffy before their big showdown. Plus I did enjoy most of the early Nerds scenes. Andrew and Jonathan retained a kind of warped sweetness even when trying to be ""Crimelords"", that made you feel very conflicted over whether you should care what happened to them.I suppose this season seems like such a departure from the others because of the fact that the emotions of the characters achieve dominance over the action for a change. This results in an entirely different tone to the previous seasons. There is a disjointed structure in the narrative for example. One episode would deal with something important and then the next would disregard it completely. Our main villians are infact nothing more than red herrings and we lose the important characters of Joyce and Tara. The viewer suffers a lot of changes and upheavals, and unfortunately it doesnt really pay off. Not to say that all stories should have a happy ending but after such an amount of grinding misery it would help a little.Even dispite its change of pace and noticible lack of humour, season six maintains a certain level of distinction for experimenting with an already winning formula. It is quite fearless in taking these well established characters and situations down an new and much darker road and for that it should be given credit.",N/A

502196,"This film has two different parts or halves: one is a light love story not very original:  Amy, a female architect falls in love with Virgil, a blind physiotherapist. This isn't much until you join the another part, because that's yes, a very big and I think very difficult neuro-physiological problem. Perhaps yes, in the USA that question has been attempted to cure. If yes, I don't know with what results.Because the core problem is Virgil, practically a person born blind so he never was able to see nothing, is submitted in New York to surgery of his congenital cataracts. Below this relatively simple problem of the eye, solved by ordinary surgery today, he has also the rare disease of retinitis pigmentosa. This disease is real in some few people but the question goes more far than the strictly clinical problem, as Virgil recovers the sight after surgery but although he sees with his eyes, he doesn't know nor understands what are the things and people he sees: the persons, the buildings... nothing. This is because the brain needs training in order  to interpret the images. Virgil's brain hasn't that training and he's yet a man over 30 years old.A hard question. The problem is similar to that of a person which hears a foreign unknown language: he hears, but doesn't understand nothing.This is an enormous problem as sight is a very delicate sense, very prone to false feelings.  I have my doubts if cinema is the best  mean to show this difficult question. The movie is solved in routine way but merited more than that.",At First Sight VHS

She brings him home to meet the family, who all happen to be vampires. A little love nip gets Pasdar hankering for some blood, and he reluctantly goes along with the band of psychotic human hunters. Pasdar's dad, Tim Thomerson, tracks down Pasdar and takes him back home. A blood transfusion fixes Pasdar right up, but the pack of vampires follows him, kidnapping his sister. A fiery climax ends this weird little film.Lance Henriksen is the leader of the pack, and he is great. He has never received the recognition he deserved, and I wish ""Millennium"" was still on. Bill Paxton plays ""the crazy one,"" the vampire who enjoys killing. In short, is seems to be the same role Paxton plays every other film or so. Pasdar and Wright are okay as the bloodstruck couple, but there is no real body heat between them (so to speak).My problem with this film is this vague lack of spark throughout the film. Everyone goes through the motions, but no one looks like they are really into this. Like Red's other notorious film, ""The Hitcher,"" this film opens badly. I felt like I sat down in the middle of the film, not the beginning. Pasdar and Wright are not given enough time to generate this Romeo and Juliet kind of love they are supposed to be experiencing. The vampire ""family"" are all nuts, and are not given enough time to show any care for each other, which means we eventually do not care either. Thomerson as the veterinarian dad is very good, but again, in an underwritten part.The film certainly looks good. The special and makeup effects are great, especially the infamous scene of a little fifth grader-looking vampire running down a highway in sunlight and bursting into flame. Bigelow's direction is good, if a little sloppy. There are a couple of editing errors, but she does a good job of keeping things going.When you think things are finally clicking, the film makers throw in a silly scene that makes you rethink your previous joy at the film. The blood transfusions and the second kidnapping of Pasdar's sister (really dumb) just provide grist for the mediocrity.Throw in a completely inappropriate musical score by Tangerine Dream, and this film is a definite mixed bag.

Amelia Earhart was a pioneer of aviation when flying was still dangerous, when airplanes crumpled like kites, and only to be undertaken by adventurous men. Although, for a while women's  aviation was competitive with men's aviation, since engines and machines even up the playing field.The story is pretty much about the adult Amelia Earhart (Hilary Swank), although we're shown a young Amelia become enthralled with flying upon seeing her first barnstormer. Earhart's accomplishments are pretty much hit on in this film. The first woman to fly across the Atlantic, as a passenger, winning a cross country air race, her meeting with and falling in love with G.P. Putnam (Richard Gere) who made her a celebrity. The film makes it clear Earhart was uncomfortable with that celebrity endorsing a cigarette brand when she didn't smoke, luggage, a clothes line, a waffle iron, all that was missing was a perfume. It's clear that Earhart was not only a pioneer in the air but in the area of celebrity endorsements, and that status chaffed at her. In her eyes, her accomplishments were diminished by having to be only a passenger on that first trans-Atlantic flight. Putnam made a her feel like a ""white horse jumping through hoops"" but rationalized that it was necessary to fund her wanderlust of the skies.Also detailed is her setting up with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) the first airline shuttle within the United States, again, for this business venture Earhart allows herself to be used as a figurehead to attract business for Vidal's airline. Earhart also meets Vidal's son the future writer Gore Vidal, who even at a young age it seems was proposing alternative lifestyles.Earhart wanted to erase all doubts about skills as an aviator (aviatrix in the parlance of the day), that she was more ambition than accomplishment, and undertakes to circumnavigate the globe, which no man had done. Did Earhart undertake this expedition because she was insecure about the circumstances of previous accomplishements?The acting by all the principals is what you would expect of actors of this caliber, there's nothing flashy here, but then the script doesn't really call for it until the end with Earhart and Putnam promising to see each other soon.Of course we all know the outcome of that last flight and the speculation and mystery it's generated since, but this movie doesn't rise up to the level of the mystery or its stars. 3.5 stars",N/A

6742,"Starship Troopers was known for one thing, and that was the gore.  However the main meaning of the movie was lost due to that.  This movie is a social  commentary/satire of war propoganda that was so evident during WWII on both  sides.While Verhoeven used this to much better effect in Robocop (the  media campaign where the public is swayed to accept the brutal methods of  law enforcement by Robocop in a series of PR campaigns).  However, it does  have some impact here, but it is used too straightfowardly (there is little  deception from the media) to be truly effective.The story revolves  around a group of preppy rich kids from Buenos Aires (yeah right) and the  journey from teenagedom to responsible citizens.  That part of the movie is  fairly derivative and the characters are all cardboard cutout, Melrose  Place types.However the special effects are out of this world.  From the  Armada fleet scenes to the spider like creatures, the EFX team deserve  kudos for their fantastic efforts.  The set designs and cinematography is  also top notch.  Just don't expect a story to go with the eye candy  though.The DVD is exceptionally clean and thesound is excellent.  There  are many features that make this worth buying, from the Verhoeven voice  over, the deleted scenes and the scene tests between Casper Van Dien and  Denise Richards.  For extra's, the DVD proves it's own worth.If  Verhoeven could have taken more control of the story writing and character  development, rather than relying on special features to keep the audience  interested, this could have been his Robocop for the 90's.

So I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to.It's quirky and sort of dark, which I like, and it has a consistent tone of unreality all the way through, which I also like. I'd gotten the idea that the Wilson brothers (Owen, et al) are closely bound up with Anderson, so I was relieved not to see any of them here because I can't stand any of them.But I didn't mind some actors whom I usually can't stand (Tilda Swinton and Bill Murray), I liked one I always like (Frances McDormand), and I was indifferent to the rest, to whom I'm generally indifferent (Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, etc). The kids were okay but nothing exceptional.I don't see what in this movie freaked out the people who were freaked out by it, unless it was the sex play between the kids; but heterosexual sex always disgusts me so this was no different. Overall, a movie I enjoyed more than I expected to but probably won't ever watch again.",N/A

The blonde brought nothing to her character except a stupid kind of normal.  I was disappointed in T3.  But I love that Bumble.  He is my kind of cool.  If your producers understood people at all, they would have recognized that with our current economy, people need to see loyalty and responsible conduct.

1069660,"Vintage Shaw Brothers movie from '69, given the first class treatment from Image Entertainment. Samo Hung is NOT in this movie, nor did he work on it, but don't let that stop any of you Shaw Brothers/fu fans from checking out this cool nugget of a film. Very well-done, although I'm not familiar with the director. A very young Chang Yi has the lead role & looks good here. Actor Ku Feng is almost unrecognizable. The fu is sword swinging old skool; no wires, fairly exciting, just DO NOT expect the Venoms or Lau brothers choreography.  Despite not being directed by the maestro, Chang Cheh, it's quite bloody, and there are quite a few good set-pieces.Image, as usual, did a fabulous job; re-mastered, blemish free, widescreen picture; re-mastered audio & easy to read subtitles. Personally I liked this movie, if you read any of my other reviews you'll see I'm a hard-core fu fan, and my preference is Shaw Brothers/old-skool. I would definitely recommend this to like-minded fans, but not to people who only saw ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and think it's the last word on martial arts movies.

The point is nicely made, but just isn't enough for a fairly  long movie. Which is what causes the problems.Because after about half  an hour, Verhoeven suddenly realises, &quot;Drat, I'm stuck with this  now.&quot; And the film deteriorates into a pretty silly special-effects  showcase. Entertaining, but mindless. And the satirical point is at risk,  because when the film ends, you've forgotten how it began.Nice touches  include stunning SFX and clever casting, wherein gorgeous, ridiculously  handsome models get torn up by ugly bugs, thus parodying the action movie  type.

The picture is never clear, the colors appear as if they were applied with a big crayon, almost pastel in texture and color. The subtitles were just plain terrible. There is a good 3 to 5 minute narrative at the begining of the film that is not subtitled at all, so if you don't happen to speak Cantonese (which I don't) you have to switch the language, this also happens during the film itself, especially during one of the last fight scenes, sure they are talking but there are no subtitles.For some obsqure reason though the sound quality is better than most films of it's age. I've seen a lot of cantonese films from the 70's and 80's in the past few years, and typically it is almost impossible to understand any of what they are saying even if you do speak the language.

497416,"As the film debut of Christopher Nolan, Following showed serious promise. While not perfect, its manipulation of time and use of the film noir genre is admirable and proved to be the precursor to his first widely released and superior Memento.Following is about a man with the habit of following strangers, and what happens when one of them turns out to be a follower himself. The film cleverly mixes up time, showing scenes out of order to raise questions to what later happens to the follower. At the beginning, he's long haired and unshaven, but in other scenes he's cleaned up and others he's bruised and beaten up. It's a wonderful technique to keep the audience involved in the film. We know he must get into some serious trouble, but we don't know what or why. The film's black and white photography, while likely chosen more for its inexpensive trait, complements the film noir aspects of the storyline.However, mostly due to the small budget, the acting isn't too great. Only the thief character named Cobb whom the follower gets involved with is convincing in his role. Everyone else feels like a B-movie actor, and not very good ones at that. But another downfall of this film isn't much a fault of its own. Nolan's later film Memento tells another noir story in a very similar style, but with amazing fashion (telling the story completely backwards) and a story arc (A man with a memory disorder after his wife was murdered) that far outshines Following's smaller ideas. Here it seems he was just beginning to toy with time and scene order in film, so he'd really get it right in Memento.Overall, Following is a decent little flick that is better rented before being purchased. Fans of Memento may find it especially interesting to see how the director began shifting time and scenes around in preparation for his later mind bender, but the average film viewer might want to skip it and check out the superior Memento instead.",Following

547105,"Most of the Slasher films can hardly be reviewed as legitimate good films,let alone good Horror films,but there is however a quaint nostaligia given these early 80s gore-fests.The Burning(1981) was one of the first films to embrace the formula featuring many of the ingrediants to build a good Slasher film:Summer camp,promiscuous teens,lots of nudity,a grotesque killer and of course,make-up by Tom Savini.The film is surprisingly entertaining,telling the story of a horrendously burned former caretaker of a Summer Camp who takes revenge on the kids at the camp,five years later,being it was kids who burned him in a prank gone wrong.What sets this film apart from some of it's brethern is that the acting is better than usual and characters are more likeable(including a young Holly Hunter and Jason Alexander) and the heroes being male,which is surprising,in the usually sexist Slasher films.The film has also alot of atmosphere that creates for a fairly creepy experience and one particularly frightening gore piece that takes place in broad daylight.Gore is gross,but excellently concieved by Savini,who creates some truly startling work here on the deaths and the creepy title character.There is also a surprising amount of full frontal female nudity that will surely make the male viewers happy.Still,the film is somewhat ordinary beyond that,even if it is just grindhouse fodder,despite some changes,it's still your typical slasher formula.That ending though is one creepy wrap-up!I'd apply an extra star if your a fan of Slasher and Gore films and detract one if your a film student.The DVD itself is presented nicely with a beautiful letterbox print,a behind the scenes video on the FX of the movie,hosted by Savini and a Trailer.Fun film for the Gore enthusiast.",N/A

1629802,"Director Michael Bay pulls a fast one on us and actually makes a pretty decent movie.  He changes things up with this ""based on a true story"" dark comedy.  It might have been even funnier if some of this wasn't true.  Set in Miami, three knuckleheads, stereotypical muscle-bound gym rats all, decide that to advance in the material world, they should kidnap a wealthy owner of a sandwich franchise.Victor (Tony Shalhoub) is a naturalized citizen coming from South America and likely has underworld connections.  In any case he keeps most of his money offshore.  He is a very unlikeable character, always demeaning others.  Daniel (Mark Wahlberg) is the ""brains"" of the trio looking to get Victor's dough.  He's actually sociable and manages to increase the membership of a health club owned by John (Rob Corddry).  But that isn't enough.  He's worked hard but is still short of his goal.  He wants more money.  When Victor becomes a client, kidnapping and ransom seems like the right course of action.  Helping him is his testosterone-addled best friend Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul, a loveable ex-con played with a soft emotional side by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.Things become complicated, but after a long series of torture methods, Victor gives Daniel the codes needed to get the money.  He basically signs away all his property and Daniel just moves into Victor's house.  When Victor recognizes Daniel's voice, the hapless trio decide they must kill Victor.  They try.  Several times.  Victor somehow manages to survive each time.  Ed Harris is along for the ride as a retired detective, hired by Victor to get the goods on Daniel and his cohorts.I found the film reasonably entertaining, finding the himbos fun to watch.  The film does have an amped up tone of violence, especially against Shalhoub's character.  He's such an unlikeable character however, we are almost happy to see it.  And Miami must have the only police department that shoots at unarmed, running suspects.The Blu ray disc is a winner.  It comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The various colors of Miami really pop in this film.  Awash in pastels and bright whites, the film really sparkles.  Both exterior and some dark, dirty, bloody interiors work well on screen.  Excellent detail shows sweat, beards and splattered blood with great clarity.  The disc comes with an exhilarating Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless track.  The subs are in action, particularly when the scene shifts to a strip club.  The kind that advertises ""totally nude"" but none of the performers are even partially nude.  I digress.

The film is certainly imaginative, has very strong visuals, is submerged in lovely central European folklore and is shot in luscious color. But what bothered me a little was something else: the constant mockery of the Catholic Church. Here one must say that the Catholic Church was not the most oppressive institution in Czechoslovakia in 1970. Rather, this was the time of the communist repression after the breakup of the Prague Spring. So, in light of this, these shots against a potential enemy of the communist regime seem a bit politically opportunistic, and gives a somewhat bad taste to an otherwise fine film.",Valerie and Her Week of Wonders Valerie a týden divu

1393888,"If there's one man in Hollywood who knows how to create a ruckus, it's....uh, Robin Williams.  But if there's one DIRECTOR who knows how to consistently bring sequential chaos to his films, it's Jay Roach.  The man behind the Austin Powers and Meet the Parents trilogies, Roach's talents are the pinnacle of persistent, albeit uneducated, humor.  There's nothing sophisticated about him, but it's difficult to stand by idly and maintain a flat face during pandemonium that is rivaled only by vintage Python.During this (dinner) party, you'll feel stupid.  Let's just get that out of the way immediately.  There are no high brow comedic moments to be found in Dinner for Schmucks.  It sticks to its slapstick strengths, and doesn't wander more than a few steps from said territory throughout.This is a film that is absolutely determined to make you laugh by its principles, and will fight tooth and nail to assure us and itself that these goals are met.  Is it a flawed strategy?  Probably, and it certainly wont make any friends in the movie industry, but funny's funny, straight up; the audience's destination to the laugh rarely matters.That said, this is hardly an excuse for everything.  Indeed, Roach's nutcase of a movie occasionally finds itself floundering under the unpredictability of its own comedy, often indulging in itself so much that it leaves its audience clueless and in the dark.  You'll know these moments when they arise, and it will be a struggle to find the proper emotional response.More often than not, however, the movie hits its mark, relying on viciously quick cuts and the understanding of its lovely cast to set the tone and keep it there.  When all cylinders are blasting in synchronization, the movie's a senseless riot that will crack ribs.It really owes its success to a series of performances that are committed to the cause; given what this movie may or may not represent in the genre - that is, a degradation - that's giving a lot.  Carell's performance here is the stuff of legend, reveling in so many absurdities and peculiar idiosyncrasies - and pulling each one off, no less - that there's simply no stopping the uproars when he's on the screen.  Rudd is quick to join the esoteric group of actors who excel at playing themselves in every performance, and Galifianakis, for what may be the first and last time in his career, finds himself in the presence of even more ridiculous personas.For what it's worth, it all comes together more cohesively than you'd think.  The premise is, ultimately, a gimmick, a one - trick pony, but it's one that goes a long way towards giving you your money's worth in breathless laughs.",Dinner for Schmucks

75055,"As the second installment of the &#34;Rambo&#34; saga, this film definitely ups-the-ante in terms of action and body count. &#34;Rambo: First Blood Part II&#34; takes Rambo back to the jungles of Vietnam, where most of the mental traumas that dog him began. His mission is to search for missing POWs, instead he falls right back into a war that, for him, has never really ended.As I said, the action in this film goes way beyond anything we saw in the first one (but with James Cameron as one of the screenplay writers, that's not exactly a surprise). Less content to let the personal and political dramas propel the action, this film is pretty much the reverse, with the action being cause to create those plot developments. In many way, this film seems to forget the humanity shown in the original and opts to let the excitement of the moment wash over you, like the backwash of an F-16 fighter jet, as the explosive battle sequences blast you against the back wall. Although, while extremely over the top in almost every stunt and fight, to the point ungodly suspension of disbelief is pretty much the order of the day, it is a beautifully choreographed bloodbath to behold. It basically, for good or ill, set the stage for what the 80's action epic would be expected to achieve for the rest of the decade.While not exactly a deeply emotive character in the first film, Sly gets even less moments here. There is no understanding to what Rambo is feeling being back in the place that has tortured him so. There is almost no attempt to play on those feelings at all, save an all-too-brief scene on a boat, between Rambo and the young Vietnamese woman (played by Julia Nickson) who is helping him in the mission, but that's as far as they go to give you any idea on what Rambo is thinking and feeling, being back in 'Nam after all this time. I would have liked to get into Rambo's thoughts more, as the traumas he'd suffered there could have added even more depth to an emotionally complex character. But that simply isn't what this film was about.Richard Crenna reprises his role, as Rambo's C.O., but he gets very little to do in this film. Whereas in the first he was a key to understanding Rambo and used to contrast the political themes that were presented, here he is merely a very small cog, used mainly to set up the plot to get Rambo back into action. He does have one very intense scene, where he argues with the slimy Washington bureaucrat (played by Charles Napier), which brought back a momentary flair from the first film, but it is over quickly, as the need to get back to the jungle slaughter is the paramount concern here.&#34;Rambo: First Blood Part II&#34; was less the ending of an iconic character's saga (not the least of which is due to the fact two more sequels were made) and more the start of replacing character-driven action, with action-driven drama. It created a new standard for what action films could be (and in many cases, would be) from that point on. It set up a game of constant oneupmanship with the other action stars of the day, as they all attempted to outdo what this film began. In some ways, this film is almost a whole new entity, completely separate from the original film in every thing but the characters names, yet it is also strangely completely bound to it. As a sequel to a film that had some very deep philosophical and political themes, this film fails to recapture almost any of that same spirit, but in terms of spinning the action film genre into an ever growing and testosterone-fueled behemoth, determined to make the impossible seem probable, as well as solidifying Rambo's status as an 80's icon for all-time, the film succeeds on a level no other film could ever hope to manage. This is truly the film that epitomizes the phrase, &#34;check your brain at the door and enjoy!&#34; Which I am more than able to do.",N/A

with the SB is the best out of the two;something that is quite inventive and full of Campbell's trademark humour.It stars Bruce Campbell as William Cole,Tamara Gorski(who had a very memorable part as Morrigan in Hercules)as Tatoya,Ted Raimi as Pavel,Antoinette Byron as Jackie Cole,Stacy Keach as Dr. Ivanov and others.The latter film,Alien Apocalypse,is what many think of when they think of Campbell and his movie credits;B-movie all the way.It's low budget cheesiness does the film in from the start.It stars Bruce Campbell as Dr. Ivan Hood,Renee O'Connor(Gabrielle in Xena)as Kelly,Peter Jason as President Demsky and others.Man with the Screaming Brain finds Bruce as the head of a drug company visiting a town in Bulgaria.His wife Antoinette and Bruce just don't see eye to eye anymore in so far as their marriage goes.They get friendly with a local cabby who sticks with them during their time there.Antoinette gets closerthanthis with the cabbie while Bruce later gets a fatal attraction with a gypsy played by Tamara.If Tamara's affections are in any way rejected,she usually resorts to a knife into flesh.In the town a local professor played by Keach discovers a remarkable method of regenerating brain tissue using donors which will not be rejected.Ted Raimi is the professors funny sidekick.The professor sends Raimi off with a note to present to Bruce in order to get funding for the project.Bruce outright rejects it.Bruce discovers the gypsy has absconded with a ring meant for his wife.He runs after her but in the confrontation gets whacked over the head with a pipe and is later put on life support.The cabbie sees this and he too is fatally stabbed.The professor hears about Bruce's dilemma and puts his theories to practical work on his brain.Unbeknownst to Bruce,he uses part of the cabbies brain to inject into his to regenerate the tissue.This causes Bruce to not only see things he couldn't have(the cabbies memories)but it has the effect of the cabbie's brain parts controlling Bruce's left arm,while Bruce controls the other.This amounts to an ongoing battle for domination of Bruce's brain,thoughts and actions.Meanwhile,Bruce's wife confronts the gypsy who also offs HER.She ends up in the professors lab and her brain is transplanted into a robot Raimi has been playing with for sometime.Bruce/the cabbie and his wife/robot end up hunting the gypsy down.The wife gets tossed over a bridge before Bruce can finally dispatch the gypsy.There is a tearful goodbye as Bruce's robotic wife dies in his arms.The film ends back in the States as Bruce is back home and reunited with his wife...in the gypsy's body!This film is just chock full of gags of all sorts and at no point does the film take itself seriously.Somehow,the sequence with a tearful Bruce holding his robotic wife DOES work.It gets you right where Bruce wanted you to get it.It's a bit of a windy plot,but it is just so quirky that it works beautifully all the way.I didn't find a dull spot in it.It is something like,oh,I'd say Bubba Ho-Tep,something so odd and off beat,that it's good.Ted Raimi of course is always a delight and never fails to please.Stacey Keach also gets honourable mention.Four solid stars.Alien Apocalypse finds Bruce and Renee as two of three astronauts in the future.They were sent into space and eventually went into hibernation for 40 years before coming back to Earth.However they come back to a world that has been taken over by large mites,looking for all the world like giant green ants.The aliens are in need of wood,which is their first delicacy.Their second is human heads.Renee and Bruce are captured and brought into a camp to work as slaves to harvest wood.The two become very close and later attempt an escape.Bruce makes it while Renee is recaptured.Bruce goes on to look for the president,who it is believed is hiding in that neck of the woods and planning an uprising.He finds him but he is more interested in painting than fighting.Bruce realizes he has to take on the burden himself and works his way back to the encampment to free Renee(his girl)and the rest of the humans there.He picks up about 25-30 people on his way and they attack with bows and arrows.They do indeed kill the resident aliens and claim the camp for their own.However more aliens arrive to retake the camp.A pitched battle takes place and just as it looks bad for the group,the president arrives with many more people to finally kill all of the aliens left.The film ends as Bruce has become legendary,as he goes from one camp to the next,killing aliens and taking back the Earth.This film has little or no drive at all except for Campbell's bravado and forceful style.It is obvious it is low budget and that Bruce is working,for the most part,with alot of inexperienced actors.That aside though,the plot is just nothing to get excited about and poor Renee O'Connor really doesn't have a decent line in the whole film.It's up to Bruce to carry it all,and one man can only do so much.2 1/2-3 stars.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in their w/s a/r's of 1:77:1.Extras on both include commentary,trailers,bios and featurettes.All in all we have one good and one poor entry here.""The Man..."" is the best of the bunch,being inventive,oddball but totally enjoyable.""Alien...""is the bad apple.With a totally lame

271001,"Ok, I admit it, I was actually a fan of that 2 Coreys hype back in the day.  As I've been on a quest lately to recaputre my cinematic childhood, I picked this movie up remembering the 2 Corey hype and wanting to see it again with adult eyes.This movie was actually a lot of fun.  It captures an awkward time in our lives where we are desperate to break free with that just-about-to-get-my -licence feeling.  Driving means freedom and liberation, and like Corey Haim, we were eager.  As he was the one the story evolves around, in the way only an adolescent boy can, without the coveted licence and desperate for the affection of the most beautiful girl in school, he takes the car out for the night.  What could possibly go wrong?Everything, as it soon ensues.  Near brushes with death are accompanied by many bumps, scrapes and dents in the car, as well as encounters with happy, bumbling characters and his sidekick, Corey Feldman, and that nerdy friend (a well behaved Corey Feldman).  It's not the best movie on earth, no question, but we got to see a younger Heather Graham before Boogie Nights and that she's actually hotter now than then.  After this it was all downhill from there for the 2 Coreys.  Enjoy it for the physical humor and how the disaster unfolds.",License to Drive VHS
1222701,"From the ""We're Disney, we don't need Pixar everytime we do animation!"", comes a film that disproves that theory in the CGI filled 00's. Sure, at times it's looks like a Pixar film circa ""A Bug Life"", but that was over ten years ago. Sure, my 10 year old was entertained, but when a person that age isn't ""blown away"" with the first viewing you know you got a middle-of-the-road CGI flix. Bolt (an unrecognizable John Travolta) is a dog, similar to Lassie thru James Bond, that has his own TV show where he saves his young female owner (voiced by Miley Cyrus, who sounds like she needs to lay off the two-packs-a-day of Virginia Slims) from evil trying to destroy them. But Bolt doesn't know that he's just an actor and thru a typical plot point of getting sent hundreds of miles away from the one he loves to try to find a way back to her while learning the hard truths of who he really is along the way. Also lending a voice was surprisingly Susie Essman of Curb Your Enthusiasm who I kept expecting to say ""What's the f&*%$*' a matter with you Dog?"". Another thing I noticed is alot of gags seem to be borrowed from alot of other films and TV shows, most noticeably the New York pigeons that looked straight out of '90's Warner Bros Goodfeathers cartoon, which seemed more rip-off than homage. And of course you have the goof character Rhino The Hamster, rolling ball and all that helps with the lack of original lines & sight-gags along the way. Overall, this will pass the time with the younger generation but I doubt they'll be screaming for multiple viewings over WALL+E or even Kung Fu Panda. The one-disc version has the typical Disney ""look, we still have other retread stuff"" promos and a short film starring Rhino that you'll see coming a mile away, and way too short to boot (even for a short!). A decent rental, but like what the pigeons say, ""I've seen this dog somewhere before, but where?"" you'll be thinking the exact same thing.(RedSabbath Rating:7.0/10)",Bolt
1536653,"First, I thought this movie was funny and had some entertaining elements. Second, it's hard to find a movie that any of the four main actors are in, that I don't enjoy. However, (in my opinion), I was a little disappointed because it didn't turn out to be more of the movie I thought it was sold as via the trailers. When I first saw the trailer, I was pretty amped and couldn't wait to see it, but for whatever reason, I never got a chance to see it in the theater. So, this is the type of movie I&#8217;m glad that I ended up renting it instead. Like I said, the movie was entertaining and there were some very good parts, but a little lack-luster. With a title like 7 Psychopaths, you think there&#8217;d be a little more to the story/plot that pushed the envelope&#8230;but unfortunately, there wasn&#8217;t.  Again, it was enjoyable and there was some enjoyable dialogue, but nothing I would get too excited about it if you&#8217;re looking for something that will leave you thinking.",Seven Psychopaths
1437341,"Come on WB, where is the season set?!!At least give us volume's that have more than 4 episodes. The other downside to these releases and why WB is quickly falling behind in television releases, is that they don't include any worthwhile extras and don't release the show in HD. The recent Scooby movies haven't had extras either, disappointing for such a long running character, but I can justify buying them to see them in crystal clear high definition. This series deserves the same treatment. As is, with only four episodes a release and in standard definition, I'm better watching these episodes online at my leisure and these releases seem to only be aimed at parents, or perhaps complete purists who don't mind being ripped off.At any rate for anyone who wants to purchase this ridiculous release, not even a behind the scenes feature yet about how they designed or came to creating the new series, the four episodes included are:Battle of the HumungonautsWhen two giant monsters start to attack Crystal Cove, Mayor Jones asks Fred and the gang to help him and the sheriff capture them. Meanwhile, Shaggy has to choose between his relationship with Velma and his friendship with Scooby.Howl of the Fright HoundA monster called the Fright Hound starts attacking Crystal Cove and people believe Scooby-Doo is behind it. Could be Scooby the one attacking the city or is someone setting him up?The Secret SerumThere's a vampire loose in Crystal Cove, terrorizing the residents and stealing an odd assortment of loot. When the gang does some sniffing around, they discover an unlikely suspect... Daphne's MOTHER. Things are already strained within Mystery Inc., and with this latest blow, the gang is truly torn in half. Girls on one side, boys on the other.The Shrieking MadnessWith Mystery Inc. broken up, the gang decides to check out life after high school and spend a weekend at DARROW COLLEGE. But things don't go as planned when a creature called CHAR GAR GOTHAKON begins terrorizing the campus.A decent enough four episodes, this series tries to bring back the dark tone and creepiness of the original series, so despite its arguable flaws I enjoy it. It tries to do some new things while still being strongly tied and close in roots to the original series. Give it a try if you haven't seen it or had been turned off by other recent Scooby ventures. As far as these releases, WB is starting to stand for Why Bother.UPDATE: Apparently, as of October 13th 2011, WB is listening to the fans... somewhat. After these first three releases that basically rip customers off they have announced the second half of the season will be released in a 2 disc dvd set with the final 14 episodes, Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated Season 1, Part 2. Date is set for January 24th, 2012.There is no mention, however, of Blu-ray or of any special features being included. At least the dvd set, if nothing else is released, allows fans to own over three times as many episodes as these volume releases but at only $5 more suggested retail price. The set will be only $19.99 and likely sold on sale by amazon and other retailers.",Scooby-Doo: Mystery Inc. V3 (DVD)

Choi begins to realise things are not what they should be ,especially when he discovers his patrol has one more man than it started with.The men begin to die ,and the director keeps matters ambiguous as to whether this is due to some supernatural agency ,or the men killing each other as they fall victim to madness and paranoia.This is a movie operating on atmosphere and suggestion rather than gross-out and will not please those who like their scares up front and in your face .It makes excellent use of the dark ,creepy and broody ruins rather than going for sudden jump cuts and shocks.The narrative is at times disjointed and the characters are the stock types found in any patrol movie from any movie industry the world over and one dance party sequence is hideously misjudged and defuses tension .

130252,"It's fair to compare this with &quot;Three Good Men&quot;, just another branch of service involved here, Army not Navy. (Also, in Three Good Men the incident takes place in Cuba, outside of FBI jurisdiction and what  might be termed as a hostile environment). Nonetheless, they are both about  an investigation, but 3GM ends up in the courtroom for a suspenseful  finish, while General's Daughter ends with special effects. It boils down  to a question of tatse, if you like SFX centre stage and acting on the side  this movie fills the bill. As good as I think Travolta is, and he really  isn't bad in this movie either, he delivers a cooky cutter performance. The  location or venue is interesting - an army special ops training ground  (attention has been paid to make the film realistic). Further, the film  does have its moments of suspense, but it becomes pretty clear how it will  end - early on. Travolta plays a sergeant who happens on to a murder while  investigating arms smuggling from the base. He's a sort of Rambo character  in the CID division (Criminal Investigation Dept), and his beligerant  attitude with senior officers is somewhat amusing if not realistic. He  meets the girl who is murdered, naturally likes her, finds somethings  upseting about her in his investigation, and goes gunning for the murderer  with a few &quot;Sirs&quot; thrown in to remind us of his rank!

38277,"I had never seen Magnolia before, but I couldn't resist the Amazon sale price so I thought I'd check it out. Let me start by saying that the blu-ray is great. The picture and audio leave little to be desired. There is minimal film grain, and the colors are clear and crisp. I am not an audio aficionado, but the audio sounded fine coming out of the built in speakers on my HDTV. There are multiple supplemental features including a feature length documentary on the film. The packaging is the standard blu-ray case, the ""recycled case"" for anyone who cares about that sort of thing. Overall, the product itself has no problems. The film though, is a different story.While I enjoyed parts of the film, its not something I will probably care to watch again. From a visual standpoint, the film is well made. Additionally, the story-line is original and intriguing. Unfortunately neither of these delights can save the film from the boring and unlikable characters. The vast majority of the characters are so unlikeable, one-dimensional or neurotic, that its difficult to care what happens. I understand that this film aims for a more realistic approach towards the characters, they all have real problems and are not romanticized in the way most Hollywood movies tend to do, but  John C. Reilly and the young boy seemed to be the only characters worth caring about. While there are many films where we like the characters because they're so unlikable, here its less about the characters being unlikeable as it is them being flat or tiresome. At the end of the movie, everyone supposably has an awakening experience, but its hard to believe that any of these characters have actually learned anything and will change their lives for the better. If the movie extended for another hour, which with a running time of over three hours it thankfully does not, I think we would see that most of the characters would be just as miserable and confused as they were at the beginning of the film. Of course there are many themes in this movies concerning love and regret, but its difficult for the audience to appreciate these themes if we don't believe that the characters have actually changed. And as far as the ""raining frogs"" scene, it did not affect my view of the movie one way or the other. For anyone wondering though, the scene does not play out like a surreal event with frogs floating down from a cloudy blue sky. This is how the back of the case portrays it, but the frogs actually fall out of the darkness like huge balls of hail, splattering on the sidewalk and shattering windows. Let me reiterate though, this scene did not ""ruin"" the movie for me and actually might have been something that I would have greatly enjoyed if it had occurred in a different movie with more authentic characters.The blu-ray itself works great, but the sad fact remains that in spite of the film's interesting set-up and potential to enrapture some viewers, it was impossible for me empathize or identify with any of the characters. This might not be a problem for some films, but for a film that sets itself up as a vast web of intertwining character studies, the whole experience may leave some viewers feeling the way I did, hollow and indifferent.EDIT: 4/8 I just traded my copy in for an Amazon gift card. Ultimately I decided that although its not a completely terrible film, it wasn't really worth owning.",N/A
284441,"The Letter boasts about as enthralling a beginning as one might hope for: After atmospheric shots of a Southeast Asian rubber plantation at night, a shot is heard. A man staggers onto the front steps of the main house, where a woman shoots him repeated until he is dead. A full moon slips in and out of clouds, and the woman with the gun in her hand is Bette Davis. It's a wow start, and in the first few ensuing minutes one anticipates a film in which secrets will peel back one by one, revealing dark truths. Sadly, after the first quarter hour, this picture simply falls flat despite some very nice acting and photography. The presence of an incriminating letter briefly heightens the tension, but matters proceed in a rather pedestrian fashion before Bette precipitates her date with destiny. Davis does shine in her role, as does Herbert Marshall as the devoted husband and James Stephenson as the attorney friend -- both Davis and Stephenson earned Oscar nominations for their efforts.

731059,"&quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; actor-writer-director Edward Burns' attempt at an urban thriller, works beautifully as a mood piece but fails to be fully convincing as a crime drama. Set in the early 1980s in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen section, &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is about Francis Sullivan, a young Irish mobster trying to go straight, and what happens when his brother Sean--supposedly killed by rival thugs after whacking three of their crew--suddenly reappears after three years. Burns marinates us in the color and flavor of the gritty neighborhood--the photography, a palette of browns and grays, sets an intriguing tone, and David Shire's moody, jazzy piano score is a wow. But all the detail in the world can't hide the basic thinness of the story. We've seen variations on this story a thousand times before--from &quot;Public Enemy&quot; to &quot;Mean Streets&quot;--and Burns has nothing new to add. The cast is great--besides Burns as Francis, you have Elijah Wood as Sean and Rosario Dawson, Malachy McCourt, Oliver Platt and others in supporting roles. But although the actors give their all, we never feel we have enough background about the characters for them to really come to life. And the ending, meant to be a shocker, merely seems gratuitous. In all, the best you can say about &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is that it's an interesting disappointment. (Another disappointment: I wanted to buy the soundtrack CD for &quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; but discovered on this website that it contains NONE of Shire's outstanding music--only the songs on the jukebox in the characters' favorite hangout. If you want a collection of the greatest hits of Lynyrd Skynyrd, BTO, The Kinks, etc., this is probably a good buy, but if you want Shire's music, this is a REAL letdown.)",Ash Wednesday

For example until the last scene bombs could be heard close by but little or no damage was visible. The bedrooms were vey luxurious by WWII standards and the fake German accents with the odd words here and there auf Deutsch were too much.

963118,"Zathura is pretty good and it's a movie that will definitely keep most kids entertained thanks to the wacky characters and special effects. Its back-story is exactly like Van Allsburg's first book turned film Jumanji but the acting isn't as solid. So now you know it's just like Jumanji, so you know that two kids basically start to play a game and somehow someway they're thrown into the game and everything that the game says will happen actually happens. As a person who already saw Jumanji and I'm sure everyone in the world has too seeing as Jumanji's videotape stays in every classroom I've ever been in, I should only have to explain the quality of Zathura. These kids are a little too old for their own good, and they push the PG rating as far they can. Older brother Walter has one dirty mouth so if your child still has virgin ears you may want to watch out for that.Though this story is much like Jumanji Van Allsburg still does a nice job of delivering a different set of characters and ending with a moral that will have siblings hugging each other. The ending is very predictable but if a kid is watching he/she probably won't even notice because the explosive action and fat aliens will catch most of their attention. If you are watching a movie like this with your children you can always stretch a little fib at the end and say ""see this will happen if you keep being mean to your brother"". Zathura is not really trying to come across as a children's classic or an original work but it is a nice family movie though that PG rating is used to the fullest. Walter is funny when he says it but it's not really needed. I would suggest watching Zathura on Starz first since it's being played on there now, it will save you money.",Zathura

Actually, two of the cast were raised in ""the compound"" of said poly group, one was raised LDS and the other ... we have not really learned where she came from, but not from anything related to LDS.  The show loves to portray a really negative light on the LDS church which goes beyond the normal bias polygamists have against LDS folk.  The show likes to poke fun at religion in general and really can be quite sacrilegious at times.They love to drop ""LDS-Speak"" on the viewers, who if not LDS would not get the references at all.  Are they targeting LDS people as watchers of this show??  The LDS church as come out quite critically of the crude nature of the content of this production.  So I am guessing few LDS watch.  Seems the writers could have greatly benefited by having an actual Mormon help as a technical consultant.  My best guess is that they used an ex-Mormon who never really understood their beliefs in the first place.Big Love is full of gratuitous sex ... which is likely to be a BIG PART of what people are curious about, regarding polygamist families.  I imagine many are still looking for all 4 of them in bed together.  That would have ended all credibility in an already somewhat incredulous show.  Thanks producers ... for sparing us that, at least.Now ... with all of that negativity out of the way ... BIG LOVE is honestly fascinating when it comes to viewing the interpersonal relationships between the members of this family, both husband and wives, wives and wives, wives and the various kids, and relationships with outsiders and friends.  What a complicated world these folks (in real life poly families) must live.I could not do it.  One wife is easily enough work for this guy.Special kudos go out to Chloe Sevigny for her role as Nickie...the deeply indoctrinated daughter of the polygamist sect leader, and 2nd wife in the plural marriage of the Big Love family.  Her character is really complicated, conniving, OCD, bitchy, passionate, and totally conflicted.

I had never watched this particular BBC adaptation, and so was eager to watch it before purchasing it. I found this to be a tepid adaptation of Austen's classic and the worst of all the adaptations. My ranking of the various adaptations of Sense and Sensibility as as follows:The movie version starring Emma Thompson (1995) - there's nothing I dislike about this adaptation:)Sense and Sensibility (BBC, 2008 - haunting score, beautiful cinematography, faithful in most respects, and excellent casting, especially the role of Elinor, which was played by Hattie Morahan)Sense and Sensibility (BBC, 1981 - very faithful to the novel, but the actors are not very appealing)This 1971 BBC adaptation is truly pathetic - the acting by some of the characters seem over the top, and the portrayal of Sir John was truly annoying. The actor playing Willoughby was the least attractive of all the Willoughby's in the various adaptations and I felt he was horribly miscast. The actors playing the sisters, Elinor and Marianne were well-cast, especially the character of Elinor, portrayed by Joanna David, who coincidentally went on to play Elizabeth Bennet's (Jennifer Ehle) aunt in the iconic 1996 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Joanna David's Elinor is sweet and sensible, and shines in her role. The other notable actor was Patricia Routledge as Mrs Jennings. Routledge went on to attain fame in her role as the pompous Mrs Bucket in ""Keeping Up Appearances"".The feature itself runs about 3 hours, and there are some changes in the dialogue compared to Austen's novel. The props and setting give this production the appearance of being a theater production, and some of the actors appear stilted and awkward in their roles. I think I will still purchase this, if only because I wish to have a collection of all the various adaptations of Austen's works, but I have to say that this is the worst adaptation of Sense and Sensibility compared to the others I have viewed.",Sense and Sensibility
1658299,"I think that a bunch of A list actors were told that they could be in a movie that was gory, irreverant and violent and that they could just have a good time with the movie knowing that they were not going to make an Oscar winner.  I have to believe they KNEW that they were going to make a bad movie from the start and to just have fun with it.Well, you could tell they just had fun with it and it is a bad movie which is what makes it so much fun to watch.  We laughed through the entire movie.  It is not a movie for the squeamish and definitely NOT a movie for kids to see.We are Danny Trejo fans.  So we pretty much know what to expect from the Machete movies.  And this movie did not disappoint in what we were expecting.",N/A
1023548,"After a five-year absence, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Metropolis and finds Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) now has a child and a boyfriend, and archenemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is up to no good again.  Lex wants own the world and starts creating a new continent; Lois is on his trail, and Superman is after her.Brandon Routh is very good as Superman, mainly because he looks a lot like Christopher Reeve.  He's a beautiful man and does a fine job, especially as Clark Kent.  Unfortunately, he's given little dialogue.  I thought Bosworth and Spacey were both miscast.  His gloomy Luthor is also a man of (too) few words, and he's lethargic and boring to boot.  Bosworth looks like a glamorous 20-year old model and lacks the wonderful awkwardness that made Margot Kidder's Lois so endearing.  Even boy photographer Jimmy Olson and editor Perry White look wrong.  They should provide a little humor, but are bland and forgettable instead.  The film has so much computer-animation that nothing feels real.  There is no romance or sense of danger.  If you like non-stop action on a grand scale, you'll enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for memorable characters that are developed and ring true, you'll be disappointed.",N/A

668279,"As one of the longest running horror franchise in movie history, there really isn't much left up the sleeve of the &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; series to scare us with by the sixth installment. So, they decided to focus less on horror and a little more of fun. The results are not too bad, as far as sequels go.Determined to make sure Jason is dead once and for all, Tommy Jarvis (played by Thom Mathews) digs up his body with the intent to cremate him. Instead, he accidentally reanimates Jason and the killing spree begins again. Can Tommy stop the now-undead murder machine, or will the local Sheriff (played by David Kegan) and a town that wants to move on from the horrors of Jason Voorhees end up getting him, along with all of them, killed in the process?Right off the bat, if you are expecting straight-on horror from this outing, you are sure to be disappointed. Writer/Director Tom McLoughlin opts to take things a bit less serious than past chapters of this saga have been, adding in an element of humor to the mix and toning down on the graphic gore (although, personally, I think we could have used a little bit more of the latter). It's a formula he would use in many of the horror works he'd do after this, for both the big screen and the small one. While in less capable hands such things usually become a train wreck, McLoughlin never lets the humor stray too far into goofy slapstick and utter parody. There are a few of the in-jokes and camera mugging moments that are groan worthy, but overall the humor never totally overpowers the more horrific aspects of the film, as has happened in other attempts like this.The cast, which is mostly a &#34;who's who&#34; of television roles, does an overall solid job with the material they are given, with Thom Mathews and David Kegan the real standouts. Mathews does a great job of making you feel for Tommy's plight, while Kegan's sheriff is a great foil to Tommy. Jennifer Cooke (who fans of the 80's television series &#34;V&#34; will remember) is sexy, but never in a trampy way. In fact, there wasn't really anything in the way of nudity in this film, unlike so many others of its kind, but I never even missed it, as I was just having a lot of fun watching things unfold.In a lot of ways &#34;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI&#34; was one of the earliest films that help to bridge the gulf between horror and humor, that many others would follow for the next couple of decades. And while those efforts are certainly a mixed bag, I think they made it work well enough here to make an enjoyable little popcorn horror-comedy, provided you don't think about the actual plot too much. Die-hards of straight-laced horror and gore, as well as this saga's previous chapters, will probably not find this film to their tastes. But for horror buffs who can take their scares a little less seriously, this film is a great way to kill an hour and a half and have some fun doing it. It's a fairly enjoyable sequel to this franchise and certainly a decent horror-comedy in its own right.",N/A

In fact, I actually found myself  liking it. It's too bad that Rollin didn't have more money and time on this  one, it would be interesting to see what he could pull off.

595412,"A clever, well directed but, ultimately, underwhelming suspense science fiction thriller Signs gets much right but just as much wrong. Clearly Night has tremendous talent as a director. While the characters are well drawn, the performances very good and the central idea interesting, the last act needed some work. Working solo as writer and director Night probably didn't get much input from another creative force. He could have used it with Signs.The McGuffin is the threat of alien invasion. Really, it could have been set at any time during World War II with the Nazi's. It's just the catalyst to drive the plot forward. The alien invasion itself is pretty tame and not very well thought out. The motives for invasion unclear, the reasons they leave also a mystery.The film is visually stunning and visually interesting using a lot of unconventional camera angles and stylistic choices to make the film interesting despite the flawed script. It's what Night doesn't show that frightens us more than seeing everything. It's a classic lesson that's been forgotten by most film directors. Night shows an understanding of suspense not seen since Spielberg's early days. He also avoids the cliches that Spielberg avoided early in his career and has only recently escaped from (for the most part).The DVD is stunning looking with sharp images and beautiful color. The beautiful transfer and resolution is most noticable during the night sequences particularly when Gibson first sees the ""monster outside my window"". The extras are nice with an excerpt (like some of his previous DVD's) from the films Night made as a youth. The multi-angle storyboard option is also nice as well giving us an inside understanding of the film making process.The only suggestion I would have made for improvement would have been to allow viewers to view the preview version vs. the final version. It would have, again, been interesting. Sometimes the preview version is superior to the final film (e.g., Jim Cameron's The Abyss). Overall, this is a fine DVD with a set up that doesn't quite have the eventual payoff it needs to succeed. It's still a riveting film for the first two-thirds of the film. Enjoy and keep your eye on Night as he's a major talent that's still finding his way.",Signs
155440,"This movie is almost 3 hours long but as a testament to how good it is you don't really feel it.  From the beginning you can tell you are watching a classic; from the great score to the excellent script and cast it's hard not to be caught up in the story and to be touched by it as well.  Despite its age, the film ages well because it covers themes that are still relevant today such as loyalty, adapting to new environments, self-sacrifice and lack thereof etc.  This movie stands the test of time and despite repeated viewings will still amuse, entertain and touch most of us to the core.Unfortunately, this DVD version of this great film is an unworthy version to pay any respect to this classic.  It hasn't been restored well and so many picture quality imperfections exist and the sound quality is just Dolby Digital Mono which should be improved.  There are no Special Features to speak of as well making you wonder if you are better off getting the VHS.  Here's hoping that they will consider another restoration project for this film to vastly improve the picture quality and the sound quality by adding Dolby Digital 5.1 or THX Surround options plus some Bonus Features worth shouting about.In the meantime, while this film is a true classic, you may want to wait for an improved DVD to surface so as to get the most enjoyment that you can from your viewing experience.  Perhaps a Blu-ray version may be just the excuse to restore this film to the quality that it surely deserves.

He really comes across as the creep he is intended to.  You grow to hate him, which is the point.Mariel Hemingway - her acting debut in which she shines.  A great performance.Ann Bancroft - plays the lawyer convincingly.  An all round great actress.Margaux Hemingway - the lead actress, and real-life sister of Mariel (unfortunately died tragically in mid 90's). Not a great actress by any means but she had her moments in the film.  Pity about her voice.  She was actually a model in real life then, rather than an actress.The film bombed upon release in 1976 possibly because audiences couldn't accept Margaux trying to switch to acting.

I own the first 3 seasons and the box sets are made with high quality materials that seemed aimed for collector's or to those who like quality in a dvd box set.This season, being the last season, I expected the same.Instead it is a cheap plastic hard cover box that looks like a cheap import and not a quality USA made product.  To make quality box sets with extras for 3 seasons and then take a short cut on the 4th and final season of a show is beyond me.  Whether made by one or several companies/studios or one, the quality should be the same throughout the entire show series.  When I opened this, I was shocked at the cheapness and was upset in thinking it was not the real product I ordered... that is until I went back on Amazon and read other reviews and saw this was indeed the authentic final season, but made cheaply.  It is 5 discs in a clamshell.  That is it, nothing else.  I have not watched the shows yet....almost afraid to - LOL. In reading other reviews, the quality is slightly less than the other seasons, but cannot say for sure.  All and all, if you want the full series, this is a must have.

Both seem psychologically depressed because they talk very softly and rarely smile.  Some strange incidents occurr and next thing you know, Bill Pullman is in jail for killing his wife.

The young guy goes through a bizarre sexual journey involving his girlfriend and Bill Pullman's wife.  Wait a minute, I thought she was killed?  Well, she was and wasn't.  His wife in the second half of the film has blond hair, but in the first half she had brown hair.  So in some ways, she is still alive.. I think.

109472,"Altered States literally got me INTO floatation tanks, and what is known now as R.E.S.T. (reduced environment stimulation therapy), not the old foreboding sounding term, sensory deprivation. i was so enthralled w/ the film, i found a tank back in 1980 in San Antonio, and discovered what floating was REALLY like, and i loved it. it is completely quiet, absolutely dark, and the filtered water, which is saturated w/ Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) to practically 50% (they got it wrong in the film when Arthur says 10%.), and makes you float like a cork. plus the water temperature is 93.5 degrees (maintained by solid state waterbed heaters, in the ones i built), which is skin temperature, so once you steady yourself in the tank, after a short while the feeling that you are in water, virtually disappears. after 20 minutes or so you fall into a deep trance automatically, similar to meditation, but you don't have to do anything; the environment, and lack of stimuli does it FOR you. in the absence of stimulation, the brain begins to create its own, so sometimes you have pleasant hallucinations, and studies have shown your natural, brain ""feel good,"" opioid like, endorphins increase. (subjects given naloxone, an opiate antagonist, often given to heroin overdose patients to block the effects, say they do not experience the euphoria associated w/ floating while on it.) after falling into that trance, the usual cycle is to remain there, in sort of a timeless state, for about and hour, to an hour and a half, and you come out of it feeling extremely relaxed, w/ your perceptions very sharp. (you also shower off the Epsom salt.) the effect lasts several days. and you do not turn into primal man, or a quasi-simian creature! the horizontal tank w/ the beveled end, including the door, that appears in the movie, was based on one designed by R.E.S.T. pioneer, and dolphin expert, the late Dr. John C. Lilly, who the character of Eddie Jessup is loosely based on in Paddy Chayefsky's novel, which the movie was derived from, and a screenplay by Chayefsky, which he switched his name on to Sidney Aaron, because of differences w/ the production. frankly, i love the production & kno every line of dialog... Lilly authored many books on states of consciousness, and one in particular on tanks, called - The Deep Self: Profound Relaxation and the Tank Isolation Technique, 1977, Simon & Schuster. Lilly did do some floating on psychedelics, and reported his findings in his books. in fact, he actually did it on Ketamine, (which further blocks your sensory input), i remember reading in a Penthouse interview. just to say i had tried it once, i did do it on a psychedelic, and found the experience somewhat overwhelming. i did not freak out, but i concluded that the tank experience, in and of itself, is more than enough for self-exploration WITHOUT the use of any kind of drugs. after all, the whole point of it is to change your state of mind, by changing your environment. drugs become superfluous, so i really disagree w/ Lilly on this.i became so enamored w/ floating in 1987 i built a floatation tank of my own, and have been floating off and on, as i have moved around and assembled new tanks, for the past 25 years. i usually do it about 3 times a week. it is great for your blood pressure, arthritis, depression & anxiety, drug abuse, and many other conditions. i did an independent study on it in college for the head of the psychology dept., and got full credit and an A. i am considered one of the authorities on the subject in N. America.Altered States has become my all time favorite film (tying w/ 2nd & 3rd Clockwork Orange, & 2001 a Space Odyssey). it is not a Dr. Jeckel & Mr. Hyde story; it is one of love and redemption. in the end it is the love of Eddie Jessup's wife, Emily that brings him back from oblivion. there are many great reviews here; i do not have to reiterate them. what i want to say is that as a BluRay edition/release THIS IS A COMPLETE FAILURE. one would think that after 32 years, they could have been a little creative w/ this. there are no extras at all, except for the trailer. not a damn thing that wasn't on the DVD, (which had an option on it that said, ""Float Naked"" that went nowhere!) they could have done a retrospective on Ken Russell who was born to direct this film. they could have done something on the work of Dr. John Lilly and the science of R.E.S.T. they could have done something on the beautiful score, by Pulitzer Prize winning composer, John Corigliano (which was released in the late '80s Dolby ProLogic surround sound). they could have done something on Bran Ferren's amazing, award winning special effects. they could have done something on make-up pioneer, Dick Smith. need i go on? there isn't even BluRay Live feature to connect w/ other fans. this film has a huge cult following! as a BluRay release, it looks and sounds great (on my 46"" Sony LCD HDTV & 7.1 channel Home Theater, in DTS-HD Master Audio), but that is all that can be said about it. if you are a fan GET IT for that reason alone. (i pre-ordered it as soon as i found out is was being released, for $13.96, and Amazon refunded me $3.97, because the price had come down, which is a great reflection on its worth as a BluRay edition!)  Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a piece of disappointing crap. i was really looking forward to some intriguing extras. (if you can find them somewhere, i did, the defunct SciFi/Fantasy movie magazine, Cinefantastique did two editions on Altered States around the time the movie came out, that were superb. one was on the making of the movie, and the other was on Dick Smith's incredible make-up effects. i cherish them dearly.) some of the best stuff in A.S. is Arthur & Mason (Bob Balaban & Charles Haid) getting into verbal cat fights, when they are loudly talking over each other. one time i watch it i try just to listen to one of them, the next i listen to the other.

833532,"The Last Man on Earth (Sidney Salkow/Ubaldo Ragona, 1964)I'd have probably ignored this film for the rest of my natural life. I've heard it reviled, vilified, and otherwise trashed by most every Richard Matheson fan on the planet and score after score of critics who fled, screaming and retching, from theatres upon its release. However, I have a friend who is a very big fan of movies that have that particular train-wreck feel to them that I find so appealing, and every time I mention The Omega Man, he counters with The Last Man on Earth. So  popped it into the player Friday night to see what all the fuss was about.The fuss is about atmosphere. It's certainly not about acting, technical proficiency, consistency, or anything else of that sort. Matheson adapted his own novel, but by the time the movie was finished, disowned the project, insisting that his nom de plume Logan Swanson be put in the credits (Swanson, Matheson was heard to say later, wrote ""some of the worst crap ever""). And, really, it is. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price, basically reprising his House of Usher role from four years previous) is a scientist who has survived a worldwide plague that has turned his friends and neighbors (and the rest of the world, of course) into vampires. (For vampires, they look an awful lot like the zombies of modern horror films; George Romero has, in fact, cited Matheson's novel I Am Legend as one of the main influences for Night of the Living Dead.) Led by Morgan's old friend Ben (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart, who turned up later in the infamous stinker Bloodsucker Leads the Dance), the vampires, presumably for lack of anything better to do, crowd around Morgan's house at night, shunning the mirrors and garlic he leaves on the door, banging the dies of the house with sticks and rocks, entreating Morgan to come out so they can kill him. (One wonders why Morgan didn't move into a high-rise, but one may be influenced by having seen The Omega Man too many times.) We get lots of flashback about how the plague spread, and then Morgan meets another survivor-- female, of course(Franca Bettoia of the Sandokan franchise), so they can repopulate the planet. Or something. Because, after all, this is an Italian horror flick, where nothing can go right.Much has been made of the pseudo-fascist imagery, and there is much to be said for it as a subtext, but where the movie really had a chance to shine is in the opening third, before the flashback starts, when we see Morgan going through his daily routine of cleaning up the streets, shopping, staking some vampires and tossing them into the plague pit (which is still aflame after three years-- which seems like a lapse in film logic, but really works, on an eerie sort of level), replenishing his garlic and gasoline supply, etc. There is an almost limitless potential for atmosphere in these scenes, which is evident because despite Salkow's hurrying through them to get to the picture's real plot (which doesn't actually start until almost an hour into the movie, when Price meets Bettoia), there's atmosphere in spades anyway. This despite the widespread and utterly false belief of directors in black-and-white-film days that you could film in the daytime and have viewers believe it was dark because a car had its headlights on. (There are a number of cuts in a scene where Price is dashing back to his house after dark where portions were obviously shot at, or close to, noon. Beautiful.) This despite the terrible acting by the zombies, and Price's woeful narration, which sounds more like he's already one of the undead than just some guy who happens to be tired of his lot in life. There's still so much in these opening scenes that works. One wonders what might have happened had the original option on the novel (optioned by Hammer, who had signed Val Guest to direct) panned out. Maybe Logan Swanson would never have reared his ugly head. ** ",N/A
1012898,"This movie has it's good points and not so good points regarding (1) the main characters, (2) the supporting characters and (3) the overall storyline.1 -- the main charactersVince Vaughn -- this is the funniest I've seen Vaughn (second best was his role in Swingers).  I especially loved the scene where his girlfriend accuses him of being bitter that her brother kicked his a**.  The look on his face as well as his response just cracked me up.Jennifer Aniston -- on the show Friends, I thought Aniston was the funniest female character (and, therefore, couldn't understand why Lisa Kudrow kept winning awards).  But I've noticed that in movies, she doesn't bring the same sparkle she brought to Friends.  Instead, her performances falls flat.  This movie is no exception.  Her acting here is very lethargic.2 -- the supporting charactersJon Favreau -- loved him in Swingers and in this movie as well.  The scene at the end where he's giving Vaughn advice on how to handle Aniston's new love interest is the funniest part in the movie.Cole Hauser -- Hauser normally plays serious roles, but in this movie, proves he can also do comedy.  The scene where he hits on these two women is both creepy and hilarious.Jason Bateman -- I'm a big fan of Bateman.  He's just a natural comedian.  His role in this movie is small, but he still manages to make those scenes funny, too.Justin Long -- I think Long has a very natural, very believable acting style.  In this movie, however, his talents are underused.  Instead, he relies on a weird hairdo and costume to provide all the gags, but they're not even funny.Vincent D'onofrio -- D'onofrio is the only person in this film who seemed really out of place.  His attempts at trying to be funny only made me cringe and feel sorry for him.  He should stick to drama.3 -- the overall storylineThis movie definitely has it's funny moments, however, I have a gripe about the overall storyline.  What bothered me was that the fault of the breakup seemed to rest solely with Vaughn's character.  But I think they were both at fault.Towards the end, when Aniston is blaming him for not giving enough to the relationship, Vaughn makes an important point that he's not a mind reader.  I agree.  Based on his apology at the end, I think had she spoken up, he would've done anything to make her happy.I mean, I could see if she asked him to change and he refused, but she didn't even ask.  Instead she expected him to read her mind and when he failed to do that (because he doesn't have any magical powers), she let her resentment fester to the point where she broke up with him.This seemed really unfair to me and not a good message for women to walk away with.I think a better message would be for Aniston to apologize as well, saying she wished she had spoken up earlier about her unmet needs and because she didn't, it caused her resentment to reach it's boiling point.That would've been refreshing to see.",N/A

1052548,"I really wanted to love this film. I thought it would have everything that could possibly appeal to me - a beautiful setting, gore, humor, suspense, Brazilian music.Nope. Fell flat, right on its face. Now, anyone could tell by the trailers and some of the movie posters that it would be a Hostel rip-off. I'll give it credit in saying yes, it is much more believable than Hostel in that organ donation participation could certainly stand to be increased (not only in smaller countries, but everywhere). And yes, I imagine a well-cared-for American organ would most likely be a very, very good thing to a villager in another country in dire need. So that's the upside - that this could quite conceivably happen, I suppose.I just really wish the matter was approached differently. Again, we have foolish characters far from home. A rickety bus ride through a winding mountainside? SURE! Walking through this jungle in the middle of nowhere to have a freakin' drink? I'll lead the way! Following this young boy who barely speaks English deeper into the jungle and putting my life in his hands? WHY NOT?! It just exasperates me, the level of sheer stupidity that these characters display.Parts of the movie were entirely too dark - I had to temporarily up the contrast on my TV just so I could see what happened once they reached Kiko's uncle's house. Other parts of the movie were absolutely gorgeous. The underwater scenes were beautiful to watch.

I'm referring to the terrible, ill conceived  romance between Peter and Sue Ellen.  It might have been a little more tolerable if the producers had hired a good actor to play Peter, but instead they got Christopher Atkins.That brings me to the subject of another bad casting move, just to get a big name.

Directed by a Mongolian woman and an Italian man who met as students at a German film school and set in the Mongolian steppe, the plot is slight and the directing style is somewhat artless, yet the story is charming and interesting. After a difficult delivery, a mother camel refuses to nurse her young. The camel owners (nomadic Mongolian shepherds, living in a ger in the steppe) send their two children to the city in order to get a violinist to convince the camel, through music, to feed her baby. And the movie allows us to see a particular civilization that is increasingly encroached by the modern world (one of the movie's most poignant scenes had the children demanding their father for a television).",The Story of the Weeping Camel

1544794,"Author Jodi Picoult has penned some surprisingly ambitious and thought-provoking page turners.  Adapting them, though, is a sometimes tricky proposition.  Here are three Lifetime TV movie attempts that met with varying degrees of success.  Not a bad collection for the price if this is your type of entertainment.  I'll comment more extensively on ""Salem Falls"" as the other two movie have been around for a while and/or released on DVD previously.Salem Falls (2 1/2 Stars):  From 2011, this adaptation probably veers the furthest from Picoult's original vision of small town scandal.  When a mischievous trio of high school girls employ the dark arts, one wishes to find a mysterious new love interest. Enter drifter James Van Der Beek, a man who seems to be on the run from a troubled past. The loner meets up with a local diner owner when he almost kills her father!  How's that for a meet-cute? As he takes a temporary job in her establishment, romance blossoms between the two even as the high school vixen makes her play for the irresistible stranger that was conjured specifically for her (she's a bit of a nutcase). Of course, the present day circumstances start to feel uncomfortably familiar to Van Der Beek and the secrets he wants to stay buried surface in the most unpleasant ways. After the fairly successful set-up, however, gets Van Der Beek in hot water with the town (it's a literal witchhunt), the movie turns into a pat and convenient mystery.While Van Der Beek seems a bit too stoic to inspire such instant adulation, the beginning of ""Salem Falls"" is a decent enough entertainment. But things start to go awry when it strays away from soapy melodrama into supposedly more serious territory. The complicated issues presented aren't explored with any depth and the past mystery is solved with ease (too bad the cops are always inept in these movies). It doesn't help that the movie ventures into very familiar territory and its resolutions are trite and cliched at best. Seriously, when this movie tries for weepy movie of the week hysterics, I lost any good will that I might have had.Plain Truth (4 stars):  From 2004, this endeavor benefits greatly from a no-nonsense approach to its horrific central crime.  A baby's mysterious death is the catalyst for most (if not all) of the movie's action that brings a high powered attorney to a small Amish community to defend the young mother against murder charges.  Expecting huge amounts of melodrama with such a sensational subject matter, I appreciated that the plot remained focused on the investigation, the facts of the case, and the impact on and responsibility of the Amish community.  Of course, any TV production would be lucky to have the presence of Mariska Hargitay.  I could have lived without the simpler lessons doled out to this professional woman (city life and success is always looked on with such disdain in these types of stories), but Hargitay is such a terrific actress that she grounds every role.  Alison Pill does a good job as the teenaged mother as well.  They play off each other well and the movie has a few noteworthy surprises on the journey to the inevitable conclusion.  A solid entry for Lifetime and a solid interpretation of Picoult's work.The Pact (4 Stars):  From 2002, this movie gives comedic actress Megan Mullally a chance to stretch in a challenging role.  If you love Picoult's source novel, ""The Pact"" probably suffers by comparison as it doesn't have the opportunity to really dig as deep into the underlying truths of the story.  But it is such an intriguing and emotional tale, I still think that it is a worthy TV movie effort.  When a young couple engage in what appears to be a suicide pact (only the boy, Eric Lively, survives), the families involved are plunged into a waking nightmare.  The families are so close, the movie underscores how this traumatic event forever alters their comfortable existence.  Mullally plays off great character actress Juliet Stevenson for the movie's most dramatic sequences (they are the two mothers).  As their friendship deteriorates, the film really resonates.  Not as preachy as you might expect, the movie does try to examine the realistic emotional consequences without resorting to tear-jerking manipulation.  I give it much credit for that.  Not perfect, but worth it for the performances.  KGHarris, 7/12.",N/A
1127694,"Let me start me review by saying that I'm a casual fan of anime, and this is the first time I've seen or even heard about One Piece. That being said-my husband and I did, at times, enjoy this strange but entertaining little film.As other reviewers have said-this film is somewhat confusing for the first time One Piece viewer. The film is made with the assumption that you've seen OP before and are up to date on the storyline. That didn't affect our viewing enjoyment too much-but it did make several scenes a bit ""over the top"" comedy-wise as we may have not ""gotten"" what they were trying to say.As a fan of comics and fantasy, I did enjoy the Super Power aspect of the story-though some of the fight scene violence may be a bit much for younger viewers. I have an eleven year old son and watched this without him, knowing that some anime can be ""adult"".  After viewing this, I'd let him watch this as you won't see more violence or adult humor than in your average PG film. As to the sexual situations-it's pretty much ""innuendo"" of the slapstick variety and fairly harmless.While not on par with some anime greats on my list-like Miyazaki's works or another favorite-Tokyo Godfathers, One Piece was just wacky and sentimentally heartfelt enough to recommend to fans of the series.3 stars.",One Piece: The Desert Princess and the Pirates - Adventures in Alabasta

On the one hand, these newly-unemployed artists speak from their experience, discussing the pain of being unceremoniously dismissed from a studio that was their home, and that's sad. But though the ""death of 2-D animation"" debate will undoubtedly strike a chord in many viewers, I found the film might have played better had it been more objective. Anyone who's lost a job they needed badly might have a hard time identifying with the underlying sense of entitlement that occasionally pops up. The emotion and the heartbreak are real, but one gets the sense that the Disney employees were insulated in sometimes harmful ways from the realities of the industry, the truth about the corporate mentality, and the significance of their own careers. I'd think this would best be seen as a cautionary tale for anyone who believes their job is guaranteed secure until retirement.

1262736,"Imagine this: a giant gothic building that serves as a ""sanctuary"" to various strange, freakish and/or dangerous creatures that exist in the world.That's the concept behind ""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season,"" a fantasy/sci-fi show that started off as a series of webisodes, then got turned into a show for the Sci Fi (Sy Fy?) Channel. The first season starts off shaky and sometimes painfully silly (nubbins!), but the second half suddenly smooths itself into a solid arc of secrets, conspiracies, and a fanatical enemy organization.Forensic psychiatrist Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) has a pretty rotten life -- his girlfriend has left, his job is a joke, and nobody believes his deductions. But during a bizarre murder investigation, he encounters a strange woman named Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) who offers him a job at the Sanctuary.The Sanctuary turns out to be a vast cathedral-like structure filled with ""Abnormals"" -- mermaids, elementals, iguana-men, two-faced dudes, or anything that doesn't fall in the boundaries of known science. But the Sanctuary's residents are now in danger from a charming Abnormal named John Druitt (Christopher Heyerdahl), who has a longtime connection to Helen. And unless he gets what he wants from her, he'll kill her daughter Ashley (Emilie Ullerup).Other Sanctuary problems: a trio of amnesiac women who may be the Morrigan, a drug lord among the Folding Men, an autistic boy whose pictures reveal Abnormals, a Himalayan plane crash with a mind-altering monster, a brain parasite in the Bermuda Triangle that threatens to turn Magnus into a psycho killer, the superfertile Nubbins (like carnivorous Totoros), a man who looks suspiciously like Magnus' late father, and a pair of reporters who witness the Sanctuary team fighting rare killer insects. And John Druitt reappears to reveal that an old friend of Helen's has turned against her...And the Sanctuary has a new enemy -- the fanatical Cabal, who want all Abnormals under their control. When they unleash a biological weapon that turns Abnormals into raving killers, Helen's old study group (""The Five"") must reunite to save the Abnormal population.The first half of ""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"" is a severely mixed bag -- most of it isn't really bad, but it's not terribly unique or gripping. And the ""nubbins"" (tribbles with teeth) episode is just embarrassingly silly. But with the introduction of Nicola Tesla (who is a vampire!), suddenly the entire series tightens up and becomes far more streamlined, complex and emotionally powerful.Along the way, the writers fill the series with all sorts of freaky creatures (ranging from a Hulk-like supersoldier to a floating snake beastie), slimy body parts, and some gun-heavy action scenes. The writing is rather wobbly in the first half (""Women and geeks first... oh, no, that's all of us""), but the sci-fi edge gives it a quirky appeal (""I guess Ike didn't want to breathe the same air as the Nazi High Command."" ""Some of them didn't even breathe air"").And ""Sanctuary"" has a pretty striking look -- half industrial science complex, and half Gothic decay, with vast cathedral-like buildings, grey cloudy skies, and the half-ruined Old City. Most of the backgrounds are CGI, which gives the series a smooth, stylized look.Despite her awkward accent, Tapping is a powerful presence as the hyperintellectual, immortal Helen Magnus, and Dunne is brilliant from the start as the Daniel Jackson of the series (smart and geeky, with a tragic past). Ryan Robbins is great as the resident techno-superbrain, who is haunted by his own Abnormal secret, and Christopher Heyerdahl does a brilliant two-character turn -- he's the charming, smooth killer John Druitt, and he's also the shy but kindly butler Bigfoot.The one false note is Ashley -- while Ullerup does a fair job, the character is an urban fantasy cliche -- cocky, gun-happy, and wears a leather catsuit during fights. But the supporting cast is pretty fascinating, especially since the writers start ushering in Victorian literary and historical figures.""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"" has some mighty wobbles in its first half, but the second half stabilizes and flowers like a black rose.

1257713,"GHOST ADVENTURES season one is one of only two DVDs I will review of the infamous TV series ""Ghost Adventures"". My other review is of GHOST ADVENTURES a/k/aGhost Adventures / Ghosts Don't Existand I don't even know what is on that DVD because this is a series that has pestered the public for almost a decade.The often repulsive Zak Bagans, the cute-and-cuddly (well he is to me!) Nick Groff and the clownish Aaron Goodwin are the irrepressible, incorrigible trio of dummies who ""investigate"" the paranormal. As far as I can tell from my research, they steamroll into a site they like, shut everyone out of what they're doing, and lock themselves in to do God-knows-what for the sake of TV ratings.Their science is of course a joke. Their attempts at fraud, hoaxes, fakery, charlatanism, call-it-what-you-like, are so obvious I am shocked they are so popular. But I have a very warm spot in my heart for Nick Groff, who has been looking dreadful this year and it frightens me to think, ""Oh, no, another one's gotten sick."" Fans may recall Ryan Buell's cancer and the rumors that Grant Wilson left ""Ghost Hunters"" due to severe illness.What I love here is the team's blatantly funny nature and their realization that it is worth taking up half an episode featuring that, instead of Zak Bagan's horrific struggle with the English language yammering about the haunted locations' histories. Frankly these guys, with a little work, would be very good comic actors ~ especially Aaron Goodwin. Alas, their love affair is with easy fame, money and rotten, dishonest TV production.This may have been staged, which would make it pure genius, or it really happened, but it demonstrates how I feel about all such shows: the team is heading toward some building when they encounter some tiny children. Zak says hi to them, only to be icily jeered by the little girl with ""My parents told me not to talk to STRANGE MEN."" (Or something hilarious to that effect.) The thought of that still makes me laugh.These boys have talent, flair and love to mug for the camera. In fact the entirety of their show is mugging for the camera. Young Nick, who is actually one of the producers, used to have almost 0% camera time. Happily he is now featured as much as possible since he has always pulled double duty as the cameraman. Just know, fans, it is all B.S., and poorly executed at that.I wish I had a dime for each instance of Zak spitting or huffing into his digital recorder. (That's how EVPs are made, don't you know.)As an old-school paranormal investigator of yesteryear (yes, I was around 15 years old and interested in doing a book about the haunted locations in my hometown, so naive), I often watch these paranormal shows as a way to relax. It's no fun trying to figure out the way they have done their clever tricks, because I already know most of it. It isn't even sophisticated stage illusion ~ I really hate it when I see with my own eyes some of the cast performing lousy ventriloquism to create EVPs.But then that's how EVPs really came into existence.After all, how tough is it to get EVPs when you have at least one jerk standing there, holding a camera and then is never acknowledged as being there? How often do they say, ""It was just the paranormal team"" when they have at least two production crew members there too! That is only the tip of the iceberg.It amazes me how these programs generate actual buzz, as if there were a defensible side, ""their"" side of the story. They'd solve all this by disclaiming right at the start that their shows are only for entertainment and much of it is re-enacted or otherwise not actual footage. Because all the aforementioned is the truth. You don't need to be Einstein, Houdini or The Amazing Randi to see these facts.The Amazing Randi, a great favorite of mine since he has taken Houdini's old torch of exposing fraud, has a site with a very convincing interview conducted by Alison Smith, here [...] at his James Randi Educational Foundation.Randi, for those who know not, is an expert magician and showman turned fraud/hoax investigator. He is famous for making clear, logical arguments against all these kinds of paranormal shows.

898310,"I wonder if Sam Peckinpah's later reputation was read back into his relatively early (1964) &#34;Major Dundee.&#34;  Even in its extended version, it's a bit of a mess, though, to be fair to Peckinpah, he was badly treated by the studio.  His budget was cut, he had to compress the filming schedule, and he seems to have been denied control of the editing room.  Ostensibly, there was a lot of footage shot that seems irretrievably lost.  There were complaints when the film was released that its plot was incoherent and gap-ridden.  In this extended version, which includes about 12 minutes of footage not in the original release -- which I didn't see -- the plot seems clear enough, and the remastered soundtrack with an updated score sounds very good.  The video quality is fine too, and visually, the movie has a variety and texture that some better movies -- like John Ford's Monument Valley westerns -- can't match.  But still . . . it doesn't work all that well.Major Dundee himself, Charlton Heston, is a problem.  He lacks the easy command of idiom that seems second nature to John Wayne and James Stewart.  It's hard to imagine either of them in &#34;Julius Caesar,&#34; but they knew how westerns worked.  Heston, with his slightly affected, clipped, classical-actorly diction, just doesn't sound right, and although he inhabits his role well physically, one can't help feeling, when he speaks, that he belongs in a different movie.  James Coburn, as the scout Potts, seems totally at home by contrast, as do Warren Oates and Ben Johnson in smaller roles.  Equally problematic is Richard Harris as Ben Tyreen, Dundee's antagonist.  These one-time friends ended up on different sides in the Civil War, and Dundee accepts Tyreen and some of his officers as part of his troop on a mission to find and kill the marauding Apache chief Sierra Chariba.  Dundee seems to undertake this mission to escape the boredom of commanding a Union prison camp, and I think we're to understand that it is both quixotic and unsanctioned -- that his action, while not indefensible, is nonetheless a risk of resources at a time when the Civil War is not yet over.  That's an interesting circumstance, and Dundee has affinities with the obsessive trail boss that John Wayne plays in &#34;Red River,&#34; but where in &#34;Red River&#34; there was some heat and tension in the Wayne-Montgomery Clift face-off, there is comparatively little in that between Heston and Harris.  That Senta Berger (as the Austrian-born Spanish-speaking widow of a doctor) is brought in as a possible focus of jealousy to complicate the Dundee/Tyreen relationship doesn't really add much.  She is decorative but deserves more of a role if she is to be part of the movie at all.  One can imagine the movie without her part not being substantively different.It's not good when the circumstances of a movie are more interesting than the movie itself.  The situation in Mexico -- to which Dundee has pursued Sierra Chariba -- was interesting in 1864-65.  The French had installed a puppet emperor there, and Dundee's troop has to contend with French cavalry as well as Apache guerillas.  Some of the action is effectively filmed -- nocturnal action, cavalry charges across the Rio Grande -- but there isn't a consistently cohering visual rhythm to the movie.  The characters are written so that they don't develop; the script is uneven.  So what's on offer are striking moments -- the desertion of Hadley (Warren Oates) and its consequences; the tension that boils over when one of the confederates treats a black soldier (Brock Peters) as a servant; the comic sexual awakening of the young bugler whose diary provides the transitional moments in voice-over; Dundee's recovery from a wound while under cover in French-occupied Durango (Heston's most successful extended sequence).So . . . it's not a disaster, and one would like to have seen what Peckinpah might have done with the originally-promised budget and with total &#34;creative control,&#34; but the main characters here just don't create the necessary intensity.  Heston was a big star, with &#34;El Cid&#34; and &#34;Ben-Hur&#34; behind him when this movie was made.  With a bigger budget, perhaps Peckinpah could have matched the epic sweep of these movies and perhaps then Heston might not have seemed quite so out of place.",N/A
1512683,"OK adaptation of the celebrated F. Scott Fitzgerald novel has great production design, is lovely to look at, but somehow rings hollow.The key role of Nick Carraway is wasted on Tobey Maguire, who brings nothing at all, besides some rather terse narration.The music is totally anachronistic and completely out of place. It makes you think you're watching some commercial for liquor or something.One thing's for sure: you can't have it both ways in a period film like this. Music by Jay-Z might sell some tickets, but will date this thing terribly in a few years.

685245,"I was at the video store looking for a trashy horror movie to have a good laugh over. I encountered Session 9, and thought that it actually might not be a half bad movie. A review on the box said it was a ""psychological thriller in the style of the Blair Witch Project"". So I rented it. I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for most, if not all, of the movie. I quite enjoyed the psychological elements of the movie, although my friend did note that the characters spent most of the first half of the movie talking. It was interesting talk, at least. I loved the psychological sessions, and particularly the character of Billy. Princess was good, too. Then there was Simon. I'm not sure how much I can say about where the movie went wrong without giving too much away, but I'll try. At the end of the movie it turns out that it wasn't really a psychological thriller at all. Oh, no, no, no. It turns out it was a... * spoiler alert * case of demonic possession. Well, at least it was an excuse to * spoiler alert * kill off most of the main characters. What occurred to me at the movie's end was that the movie had been ambitious, and the director had clearly tried hard to make it a good movie. Good effort. They almost made it.",Session 9
1256252,"The recent Rise and Fall of WCW DVD has sparked more controversy than any recent WWE documentary, but is it for good reason?  Well...no.If anything, this DVD is a victim of drabness.  When I bought this, I was hoping that there would be more talk of the on-camera stories of WCW.  I don't necessarily mean it should be kayfabe, but there are a lot of really good (or at the very least, interesting) storylines from the 1986-1996 period which are almost forgotten today.  Combine that with stories about WCW stars like Rick Rude, Vader, Cactus Jack, and Sid Vicious, who are not always as documented as some of their contemporaries, and there is potential for real excitement.However, this DVD is 95% behind-the-scenes, as in ""This guy ran WCW, then this guy, than this guy, then this guy, then Vince bought it.  The End.""  This isn't that bad, as we get a lot of great clips along the way and a few moments of insight (I always love to hear from Michael Hayes), but the whole thing feels incomplete.Additionally, most of the behind-the-scenes stuff lacks juice, as the DVD tries too hard to not put anybody down.  Everybody who ran WCW, from Bill Watts to Jim Herd, are portrayed as meaning well but, gosh, just not working out.  Even Vince Russo is cited as `a real creative guy.""  I realize no human being is perfect, but all of WCW's heads made at least a few huge mistakes,  which are largely glossed over.  For example, the racial controversy surrounding Bill Watts's tenure is included as a deleted scene.  The fact that this story didn't even make the final cut shows the priorities of the DVD.I can't really fault the makers, as WCW hardcore fans (of which I am not one), probably don't want a DVD that highlights all the times they screwed up, but there is room for debate and discussion, which the documentary does not allow.As for the extra matches, WWE DVDs these days are more about releasing rarer matches than necessarily the best ones, and I'd be a fool to argue with that.  If you want only 5-star matches, there's probably 5 different DVDs you can find them on.  Generally, I liked about half of them and didn't care much for the other half, my favorites being Rick Rude vs. Sting (I'm a mark for Rick Rude) and Goldberg vs. DDP (Goldberg's best match, IMO).WCW fans looking for a definitive DVD are likely to be disappointed, those with low expectations should find at least a few things they like.",The Rise & Fall of WCW

1601839,"The great Isabelle Huppert must surely be one of the boldest, most fearless actors at work today.  But I must confess, her films are becoming increasingly hit-or-miss in my mind.  Even in her most uninspired pieces, though, I usually find Huppert absolutely fascinating.  I think that this was, perhaps, my greatest disappointment with the farce ""My Worst Nightmare.""  It is not a bad movie, per se, it just lacks any amount of originality.  And instead of offering anything new, Huppert serves up a character that she could play in her sleep!  This is a quintessential opposites-attract type comedy that pairs an uptight businesswoman (Huppert) with a irrepressible and irresponsible lothario (Benoit Poelvoorde).  Can his impulsiveness thaw her icy demeanor?  And can her seriousness make him a better man?  I bet you might already know the answer to these questions!  More to the point is whether you will care or not.As ""My Worst Nightmare"" opens, Huppert is paired with Andre Dussolier (actually my favorite character).  Their child is in school with Poelvoorde's son, and the two boys form a fast friendship.  This is especially useful as Social Services is threatening Poelevoorde and his wayward nature.  So he lets the boy establish a bond with the more affluent and stable family.  Of course, he and Huppert are complete antagonists, but Dussolier is enamored of the man's free spirit.  Before you know it, the impact of this new relationship realigns everything in the picture.  And where the movie starts out as an over-the-top romp, it morphs into something slightly more effective as these changes come into being.  The beginning of ""My Worst Nightmare"" is so overdone with clownish characterizations, this shift is all the more welcome.  But still, even as the movie gains more heart, it never really compensates with much originality in its main story thread.Interestingly, I quite liked much of the peripheral material.  Poelevarde's son brings an interesting dynamic to the movie and I liked how the family adapted throughout the screenplay.  Huppert, though, has an underdeveloped side plot set in the art world that plays by extremely conventional satirical stereotypes.  As I mentioned from the start, Huppert's uptight character reads like a stock player from countless other films as does Poelevarde's obnoxious boor.  Both are talented actors that don't quite transcend the routine characterizations they've been boxed into.  As the film progresses, though, they both have a chance to push out of the expected to become fully rounded beings.  The movie, truthfully, starts at about 2 1/2 stars (for my taste) and finishes at about 4 stars.  I'll split the difference, but this terrific cast deserved better material!

812786,"Becky Sharp (Miriam Hopkins) is a vicious social climber with little regard for other people's feelings. She began as a poor girl, but lied about her mother's background to afford herself a spot on a prestigious finishing school. Her orphaned status leaves her at the bottom of the heap there, but she makes connections that bring her into society. Amelia Sedley (Frances Dee) takes pity on Becky and introduces her to her elite friends, but Becky stabs her benevolent friend in the back by stealing her husband's affections. She doesn't stop there; she uses men for their money on countless occasions and uses her skills to weasel her way out of every bad situation. Her deception is masterful.The cast is the main reason to see this film. The story is slow moving and sometimes difficult to pay attention to, despite the short length of the film. Hopkins is beautiful and adept at playing her ruthless part, and fans will find a way to love her in spite of the character's malice. Cedric Hardwicke, Billie Burke, and Alison Skipworth also star.This movie is notable as being the first feature filmed in three strip Technicolor.

223130,"This one will only really satisfy the real fans, if even them. The story used here comes from a script that they had worked out for ""Star Trek Phase II"", the sequel series that Paramount considered producing in the seventies. As an episode in a long running series, it would have worked. In fact, it largely resembles the basic story for the original series episode ""The Changeling"" from the sixties.The bad thing, though, is that, in order to take a story from an episode and make it a 2hr+ movie, they added several long scenes of people waiting and looking at ... something. It's never clearly explained, though it's easier to understand the geometry of V'ger's ship in this Director's Cut, with better special effects. It doesn't help the slow plotting, but it eliminates a bit of the confusion.In the end, there are some classic Trek moments here and there, but you have to wade through this plodding movie to get to them. Basically, the best thing to come out of this movie is that it proved that people still had a desire for more Trek. It did monster business when it came out, but people soon realized it wasn't all they'd hoped. The studios wised up before making the next one, but they could see that there was a market.More specific to this DVD release, the special features are quite interesting if you like understanding how movies are made.Just remember, this movie is really best viewed by those who already love the series and can forgive a misstep here and there.",N/A

425861,"I'm a big Howard Stern fan however, I'm giving this movie 3 stars because it falls short of living up to the geniune vulgar comedy present in the book. yeah I said vulgar and its damn funny.This film hardly shows us  Howards  funny but, true childhood expereinces such as when his mother made him wear her underwear to school because all of his were dirty.  We didn't see him get  beat up by blacks when living in a predominantly black community. We didn't see his comical sexual experiences during his adolescent years as he described in this book. The list goes on and those were the funniest parts of the Book yet, this movie didn't take advantage of it.It appeared Ivan Riteman (whatever way his name is spelled) chose to only focus on Howards career & marriage and put a lighthearted spin on it. Yeah, I know Howard eggxagerates his personality on the radio but, the book had more of a politically incorrect NC-17 tone to it. This Movie however, fails to capture that but, instead makes Howard  into a  likeable goodhearted person. That was obviously Paramount's strategy to make this film appeal to a broad mainstream audience however, That clearly backfired since it only earned 42 Million and most of that revenue came from loyal Howard Stern Fans.  I think this movie could have been the funniest movie ever made if the director used Howards book as a blueprint, however it ends up being a tame watered down version of what it should have been.",Private Parts VHS
1469783,"I watched this film with a fair amount of expectation after hearing about it from a few people who went on and on telling me about how it was a glorious throwback to all those great action movies of the '80s and '90s. Unlike The Expendables, this film was supposed to devoid of meta-humor or irony, which was a refreshing idea, frankly. After all, the best B-movies in history were not made by people *trying* to make B-movies. So I rented it, settled in and rooted for Guy Pearce and co. to transport me back to the good old days...Let me start off by pointing out what the film does (mostly) right:1) It gives us the prerequisite badass antihero complete with mysterious past and snappy one-liners.Aaaand that's about it. Seriously, Guy Pearce's character is the only reason to think about seeing this movie. He's tough, cynical, sarcastic, professional. Too bad he's all there is to it. And to top it off, the one thing he's supposed to excel at in the movie--the action--is an incoherent mess. Within the first five minutes, there's a terrible CGI sequence that moves so fast, you don't even get the sense that anything's at stake. One thing that many so-called B-movies had (and I'm thinking of the good older ones directed by guys like John Carpenter, George Cosmatos and Joseph Zito, to name a few) was spatial coherence: you knew where everything was in a scene, where every explosion was coming from, what was at stake. Lockout, unfortunately, goes for the modern action movie method where everything moves way too fast and there's no sense of spatial logic. There is some decent gunplay in the space prison, but nothing spectacular, and not much in the way of hand-to-hand combat. What the movie's really missing is one terrific, memorable action setpiece, something that most of the films Lockout is borrowing from managed to have.People have described this as a blend of Escape From New York and Blade Runner. Well, the prison setting here isn't as interesting as in Escape (and really, how could it be), and whatever dystopian future exists in Lockout is too limited by the film's low budget to compare with Blade Runner's far-reaching exploration of 2019 L.A.  The main villains are interesting, but for all their antics, they never seem to rise above the level of minor inconvenience, and they're not all that memorable. Nobody here is going to make people forget Isaac Hayes as the Duke.I wanted to love this movie, I really did. But at the end of the day, all we've got is one sharp lead performance surrounded by a bunch of mediocre action and CGI junk. Lockout is a B-movie among B-movies, and no, that's not a compliment.",N/A
775474,"I'm kind of surprised after watching ""Suicide Club"" I actually didn't intend to at first. I saw the clip of the subway train jumping on the net like years ago and wondered where it was from but never cared to watch the movie. Some years later I check out a movie called Noriko's Dinner Table and this movie is referenced throughout it well the primary incident at least. I thought Noriko's Dinner table was pretty good strange but good so I thought I'd give this a try.After reading reviews about how people were disappointed at Noriko's Dinner table for not being a direct sequel I honestly don't get why. Compared to the 2 Noriko's dinner table was by far a better movie because it was complete,quirky,deep, and entertaining. I expected the same when I watch suicide club but what could have been a great film just turned into a waste of time.The first half of the movie starts off like a great film. Your genuinely interested in seeing what happens and solving the mystery. The film starts out with a group of girls jumping onto a railway. Probably what makes this movie famous and so talked about...then it has some odd occurrences with people killing themselves. The story has 3 main characters. 1. The cop, 2. The cute girl on the cover, and 3. The hacker chick. I only call them main characters because the events that happen to them are all turning points in the story. You start out following the cop which is by far the best part of this movie. **maybe spoiler nah not really** Something happens to him and the movie you were just watching ends right there. All of a sudden Suicide Club turns into a musical. This movie goes from Suspenseful horror to ""is this a joke?"" quick! Norkio's Dinner table had that same eerie yet goofy atmosphere but it had it throughout the movie. It didn't all of a sudden turn into a completely different movie half way through it.The moment the rock star starts singing you can consider this film over. The movie killed it's own self. From there you jump to the 2nd Main Character the Hacker and for some reason you never know what becomes of her character. It's just like the writers forgot to finish her story. Then from there we go back to the cute girl on the cover. Who solves the mystery of Suicide Club then the movie gets even weirder then it just ends with another  lame song. I honestly thought people where killing themselves because they had to listen to that horrible ""Dessert"" Pop group and that freaking song ""call me"" that stuck in my freaking head! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! ""CALL ME DA DA DA DA DA DA"" ""MAIL ME DA DA DA DA DA!"" some one kill me!Ahhhhh.... ok what was I saying now... That's right, I don't understand what the message was or what the point of this film was. I really don't get what this movie was trying to be. Noriko's Dinner Table said more about the suicide Club and what it was more than the movie ""Suicide Club"" only that in Noriko's Dinner table no one physically killed them selves they mentally killed themselves by acting as another person until they no longer could connect with who they once were. That and some other stuff it was a really good film. Suicide Club is just outright confusing. Once the 1st main character is out the scene the movie turns into something else that I wasn't interested in watching honestly.I give this move 3 stars for the first half of it. It's too unique to give it less than that really (first half only other half is a POS!). The rest of the movie can kiss the Dvd case... not worth your time to watch.",Suicide Club

I am hoping the 2nd disk has the follow up season ""Galactic Guardians"", which only had seven 1/2 hour episodes with some being a full 1/2 hour, and some being two short episodes. These would be great to package together as one set, but I fear WB will get cheap and try to get the most for their money that they can.

388683,"This little film is a bit different and it's pretty well done. I really can't complain about the quality in sound, video, clarity, casting and so on. All those things are quite good. I was a little bored with it however. It struggles to hold your attention long enough to get it's message out. It does have a great ending which is a very nice change, and there are a lot of guys in it, several of which were very pleasing to the eyes. It's all about one guys journey to the fast paced, one night stand after another all summer long in the ultimate gay party spot of Provincetown. He is looking for fun, or so he thinks, but he might just find something a whole lot more satisfying within his own heart. This guy has a problem being majorly shallow. The film is not all that immune from the same disorder, but both seem to make an amazing recovery in the end. In fact, the film makes a nice point in the ending if you can stay with it long enough to get that far. It's got some low spots to endure, but this film really does have a few high spot that make it worth watching. While most of the content is not my personal cup of tea and some of it was just not really worth watching at all for me, I can't honestly say it's a bad film. It's not by any means a blockbuster, and not one I will be watching over and over again. I would recommend this one to a select group of gays who are into the party life of sex and drugs. Those will find it most entertaining. If you are not into that sort of thing, You, as I, will be more comfortable watching something else. There are a whole lot better movies out there to choose from in my humble opinion. Nevertheless, I give this one three stars. One for the quality, one for casting and acting, and the other for the ending which doesn't just leave you hanging and feeling like you got nothing at all out of your time viewing it. I would recommend a lot of other films over this one, BUT if you are determined to watch it, just keep expectations low, and consider your own feelings about the subject matter.",Lie Down With Dogs VHS

807959,"I missed seeing The Last Samurai in the theatre but decided to buy a copy anyway because it looked good in the ads and the write-ups I'd read.Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren, former Indian fighter in the U.S. Army (bits of this are shown in flashbacks)now a pathetic drunken loser reduced to giving sales demonstrations of Winchester rifles.He's contacted by a former associate and takes on the job of instructing the newly formed Japanese Imperial Army. The story is set in 1876 or so at a time of great change in Japan, the forces of modernization fast pacing Japan into the modern age. Part of this mission involves rooting out the last Samurai holdouts. Algren leads his recruits into battle, his recruits are massacred and after a valiant fight he is captured by the very man he is supposed to deal with. Taken to the Samurai village as a prisoner Algren gradually learns their ways, even learns to respect them. Algren eventually, after failing to reintegrate with his own people (and the dishonorable Japanese modernizers who I wanted to see get killed),joins with the Samurai in a battle to the death with the new Imperial Army. This is of course a slaughter with swords & spears against rifles & Gatling guns. The Imperial soldiers are so shamed by what they've done that they refuse an order to kill Algren and the Emperor strips the chief ""New Japan"" leader of everything he has.You never really learn what happens to Algren, it seems he goes back to the stronghold and the lead Samurai's widow, but that is presented as maybe he did, who knows?I thought the story was interesting, Cruise did a good job, but something was lacking- I'm not sure what. The costumes/ weapons were great, most of the sets/ locations were too ( a real sense of being in Japan)I just needed something more. Some of the extras are very interesting, I liked learning about how things were built or designed.

1119045,"Mulberry Street (Jim Mickle, 2006)28 Days Later... ripoff that could have been so much better than it is, but actually isn't half bad. Co-written by Mickle and star Nick Damici (In the Cut), featuring cameos from Larry Fessenden and Debbie Rochon, and about a plague of mutant rats chowing down on New York City--what's not to like?Plot: the rats in New York turn deadly after mutating; their bites turn New Yorkers into bloodthirsty homicidal maniacs. The action revolves around a tenement building on Mulberry Street whose surviving tenants--including an ex-boxer (Damici), a drag queen (Basquiat's Ron Brice), a barmaid (Sad Spanish Song's Bo Corre) and her son (Maid in Manhattan's Javier Picayo), and a World War II vet (Larry Medich) and his son (Fast Horses' Larry Fleischman). Oh, and there's the boxer's daughter (Our Lady of Victory's Kim Blair), home from the Iraq War, trying to get back to the building, but having a hard time after the city shuts down the subway system because of the rat attacks.What's not to like? Well, I don't want to spoil the surprise for you, but let me just say that this would have been just as good a movie--no, a much better movie--without the credited ""creature effects"". All you have to do is turn people into bloodthirsty killers and you've got yourself a story. You don't need to turn them into monsters as well, unless you've got a portion of your budget specifically earmarked for special effects. I knew the flick was going to go downhill early on, when the building super (Tim House), who's been bitten by a rat, starts growing hair on his ears very quickly. Oh, no, I thought, you're not going to take this really fine little horror flick, which is actually working as a suspense film during the inevitably slow beginning, and try to turn it into a generic monster movie, are you? Oh, but they did. I almost wept.The other major problem the movie has is that there are so many places where the script starts to branch out into complex, interesting character development, so many stubs that tell us that given a little more time and another rewrite or so this movie would have given us a plethora of characters we could have come to care about. None of those stubs, however, ended up growing legs. There's an aborted romantic subplot, a lot of backstory with the boxer's daughter and what happened to her overseas (though I was impressed they scrapped the almost-inevitable teary comparison between the horrors of war and the horrors of rat-bitten homicidal maniacs), some bonding between the barmaid's son and the boxer that never goes anywhere, a bit of weirdness with the (stereotypical, but hey) creepy super, all of which could have been expanded, but never went anywhere. Depressing. But I chose to look at this as a movie made by a couple of guys who really have the potential to get good at this moviemaking thing, and with Larry Fessenden coming onboard (his production company is bankrolling Mickle's next film, also co-written by Damici), I have high hopes that some of that potential will be realized next time out. I'll be looking forward to seeing what they come up with. ** ",N/A
616013,"I was going to this movie thinking it was gonna be better than the first and second ones which were pure gold. The Prisoner of Azkaban was a good movie but it was very different from the book. They had many alterations which included not haviing enough Quidditch, Harry not getting his books and the scene when they rescued Sirius lasted literally for 20 seconds. I was also dissapointed with the ending, I mean it stops when Harry gets the Firebolt and even that is a mistake because in the movie fred and george open it but in the book ron, Hermione and harry open it and then hermione takes it off Harry. I do have to say i miss the old director Chris Columbus who put everything from the books in. I mean what is the use of making the movie if you are not going to finish it right? If you are looking for a good night out go see the movie but if you want an adventure read the book. Great acting performances by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Emma Watson (Hermione). The actors have all grown up and the movie grows up with them, a bit more mature than the first two movies.

372300,"I've always had two minds about this movie.  As a ""movie"" it's good.  The acting is well done, the script, except in a couple of spots, is logical and works well, the photography is excellent, and the special effects- for the time- were well executed.However, as an accurate account of what happened on the Titanic, it's a dismal failure.  However, it was not made as a documentary.I was excited about receiving the DVD version of this movie, because it included a commentary track.  I'm not so excited now.The contributions by Audrey Dalton (wonderful actress- never got the chance she should have) about the filming and her interactions with Barbara Stanwyck and the others in the cast- plus the crew- are excellent.The contributions by Michael Lonza about the special effects and Robert Wagner are good also.  (Mr. Lonza gets to be a bit of an irritation toward the end because he repeats himself.)But the part by Sylvia Stoddard- listed as a ""Titanic Historian"" is awful.  She does nothing to clarify the accident and actually gets most of her commentary wrong.  This is surprising, since her credentials as a historian are beyond question- having written incisive and in-depth studies of the ""Brady Bunch"" and ""Gilligan's Island.""  She is also listed as a member of the Titanic Historical Society, an organization with a membership list as exclusive as the Publisher's Clearing house mailers.These are just a few of her egregious transgressions:-The reason ""Sir"" Bruce Ismay wasn't portrayed in the movie is because he was still alive at the time it was made and the producers were afraid of a lawsuit.  Bruce Ismay died in 1937 and he was never knighted.-There was only ONE pair of binoculars on the WHOLE SHIP, and those were on the bridge.  The crows nest pair had been left ashore.  Actually there were several pairs aboard and the pair that were supposed to be in the crows nest was locked in one of the officer's cabins.  Fredrick Fleet, the lookout that spotted the iceberg said that the binoculars furnished by the company were of such low quality that they were next to useless anyway.-There were no historical sources available about the Titanic when the movie was made other than the record of the two inquiries.  Apparently the sources we have available today sprang from nowhere later.-Smith had decided to retire from White Star, but Ismay begged him to stay on until after Titanic's maiden voyage.  Actually, it's unclear whether Smith was going to retire at all, although most historians believe that he decided to make the voyage and then leave the line.-Ismay was pushing Smith ""almost hourly"" about making a record passage.  Titanic's speed at the time of the accident was just about the same speed that her sister- Olympic- had been making on her maiden voyage.-She has so much detail about the iceberg that she must have been in the crows nest herself and seen it personally.-Nobody knows how the ship came to be tagged as ""unsinkable."" Actually, the reference came from a magazine called the ""Shipbuilder"" published in 1911.-She tells everyone that the decision to steer to port was made because it's ""traditional"" for ships to pass objects on the port side.  The decision to pass is made based on location and relative speeds.-She makes a statement that the movie gets the crows nest call ""Iceberg dead ahead"" correct, because if the lookouts said ""Iceberg right ahead"" the bridge would incorrectly interpret it as the iceberg being to the right of the ship.  Actually it would have meant the same to the officers on the bridge.  If the iceberg was to the right of the ship, the call would have been ""Iceberg off the Starboard bow.""  Fredrick Fleet, the lookout who reported the iceberg to the bridge stated that he did say ""Iceberg right ahead.""I'm running out of room, but you get the idea.If the producers of the DVD had looked a little further they could have found someone that actually knew something- or had at least read a book- about the voyage and the ship.",Titanic VHS
1099143,"A stellar cast, consisting of Vanessa Redgrave, Claire Danes, Toni Collette, Natasha Richardson, Glenn Close and Meryl Streep,  is reason enough for watching ""Evening,"" one of those high-toned, slightly stuffy, intergenerational family dramas that is all about lost loves, wasted lives and missed opportunities, this time among the champagne-sipping elite of Newport, Rhode island.Redgrave stars as Ann Grant, a terminally ill woman whose dementia is leading her to reveal secrets on her deathbed that have been locked away in her memory for years.  Collette and Richardson play her two adult daughters who are able to glean only a few tantalizing nuggets about their mother`s past as they emerge randomly and still partially obscured from the fog of her delirium.  These scenes set in the present are intercut with those from the past, the 1950's in fact, when a young Ann (now played by Danes) fell in love with Harris (Patrick Wilson), the servant of her best friend, Lila (Mamie Gummer, who looks for all the world like a young Meryl Streep, who indeed steps in as Lila for the present scenes).  Lila also happens to be in love with Harris, but she is instead marrying Karl (Timothy Kiefler), mainly because his aristocratic pedigree mixes better with her family's blue blood (echoes of the much-better ""Atonement"" abound throughout).  Further complicating matters is Lila's kid brother, Buddy (Hugh Dancy), who appears to be in love with both Ann and Harris at one and the same time.Needless to say, much of this plays like a tony, high-class soap opera, but at least two of the characters manage to rise above the suds and fully engage our interest:  Colette's Nina, whose paralyzing fear of commitment and of making life-altering mistakes threatens to leave her a bitter, lonely woman; and Dancy`s Buddy, whose conflicted sexuality brings an unforeseen complexity and depth to the character.  Most of the rest of the characters are considerably less interesting, including Ann (both the one in the present and the one in the past) whose personal revelations are supposed to be the glue holding this overpopulated story together.  Harris is a particularly bland and uncharismatic figure for a man who is supposed to be such an irresistible magnetic attraction for at least three of the principal characters in the story.The burden of transferring Susan Manot's novel to the screen has fallen on the shoulders of director Lajos Koltai, whose metier seems to consist primarily of pretty landscapes, dusky lighting and tinkling pianos.  And yet, amid all the soap opera trappings, the movie has some important things to say about not just letting go of the past but of having the courage to move into the future.""Evening"" is decidedly a mixed bag as far as moviemaking and drama go, but the powerhouse performances (particularly by Collette, Richardson, Redgrave and Dancy) make for worthwhile viewing.",N/A
916250,"*First things first.... The front of the package of this DVD is emblazoned with the following eye-grabbing proclamation:''FROM OXIDE AND DANNY PANG (DIRECTORS OF ""THE EYE"")''Before you start getting wet & excited over that blurb, however, please allow me to facilitate your somewhat painful crash back to earth. This movie is comprised of THREE INDEPENDENT VIGNETTES (which is expressed clearly in the film's original Thai-language title, ''Pee Sahm Baht'' -- I'll explain very shortly). The first and second segments of the film were directed by Pisuth Praesaengaim, who also served in the capacity of ''writer'' and ''producer.'' The third/last installment is not even directed by the ''Brothers,'' in the strict sense -- it is directed solely by OXIDE Pang, independent of his brother Danny.I utterly HATE when DVD marketers act in such a deliberately disingenuous and deceptive manner, especially with many of the ''Asian'' titles -- they're assuming, I suppose, that everybody's ignorant and that nobody's going to call them out on their bull droppings. Al Franken has a term for it: he refers to words or statements that are ''technically'' the truth but which hide or cover over certain other pertinent bits of information so as not to tell the ''whole'' story as ''Weasel Words'' -- but there are OTHER statements, such as the one made on the cover of this DVD case, which contain ''SOME'' truth but which have been manipulated for the sole and deliberate purpose of misleading or deceiving -- these Franken refers to as ''sleasels'' ('sleazy weasels'). But I have to admit, though, that you all get ''cooler'' looking cover art for the ''Region-1'' DVD than those of us who acquired our DVDs of this title from the Asian market.The original Thai title, translated into English, is ''THREE BAHT GHOST.'' The average Thai citizen would automatically understand the reference. At one time in their history a ''baht'' (Thailand's basic monetary unit) could buy a comic book of whatever genre the reader was interested in -- romance/drama themes tend to be quite popular in places like Thailand, Philippines and Singapore, but ''ghost story'' comics were also quite popular in Thailand (much like our own ''House of Mystery,'' ''The Witching Hour'' or the old ''E.C.'' comics were to ''Baby Boomers''), and since ''one baht'' could buy the reader a ghost story comic book, such a publication became known as a ''One Baht Ghost.'' So, naturally, ''3'' ghost stories would together cost ''three baht,'' hence the ''cultural reference'' in the movie's original language title.It has come to my attention that the marketers of this ''Region-1'' DVD (which is still on ''pre-order'' status at the time of this writing) have apparently insisted on continuing to mislead their target American & Canadian audiences by following the lead of the Asian DVD marketers and supplying UNAPOLOGETICALLY INCORRECT English translations of the vignettes' original language titles. So, for those of you who hate having your intelligence insulted by ''translators'' who deliberately 'MIS-translate' & 'reword' important titles and key dialogue in Asian movies, for you I present the CORRECT Thai-to-English vignette titles (all others who enjoy swimming in blissful ignorance, please disregard):* The ''first'' installment's title, correctly translated into English, is ''Arm of the Dancer''* The ''second'' installment is entitled ''Female-Corpse Oil''* The last installment is called ''Vengeance''The three chapters are tied together by three female friends who are spending the closing hours in a cafe, each of them entertaining the others with a ghost story she's chosen to share. The stories are of different styles and of different intensities -- none of which overtly or overly terrifying; catering, of course, to ''Asian'' story styles & sensibilities. (Recall, as I explained in my ''So You'd Like To...'' guide entitled  ''FIND OUT WHAT SPOOKS ASIANS!'' that Asian stories and movies involving ghosts play mostly for tension & ''creepiness'' rather than shock & fright.)The first story tells its tale in a very ''traditional'' style, which only makes sense since about half of it plays out as flashbacks. Because of its subdued tone and ''sad story,'' however, it is almost universally panned as the weakest and least acclaimed of the three vignettes -- yet, it is for these very same reasons that make this installment of the movie my personal favorite of the three. The story recounts the history of a specially crafted drum and tries to determine why the spirit of a dead woman remains inseparably connected to it.Story number two involves a horny but unfulfilled single woman who learns of an oily substance which, when used on her desired conquest, will transform even the most upstanding & chaste of men into hyper-enegetic lovemaking machines who'll have eyes only for her. But it would seem its use sometimes comes with some very unpleasant side-effects.The last segment, which most viewers favor, involves a young woman whose body was found hanging from what would appear to be a suicide. But a young detective is not so convinced -- the evidence for suicide just isn't there, and it appears she was the victim of murder. And it would seem that every man she's ever been involved with has mistreated her in some fashion, and since she wasn't exactly pristine as fresh-fallen snow herself, any one of them could have had a motive. In his search for the truth behind her death, the detective seems to be getting a little assistance from the ghost of the dead woman. But is it ''justice'' the dead girl wants? -- Or ''vengeance''?The film's final moments with the storytelling girlfriends is also a very nice touch -- totally unexpected, catching me completely off-guard.Unfortunately, most people are not going to be able to relate to this film -- if not for expecting something as powerful as ''The Eye'' (because of that lying blurb on the package cover), then they'll be trying to hold it up to the unrealistic standards of films like ''Juon'' or ''Ring,'' and they will be severely disappointed for doing so. This film is what it is, and should be allowed to work on its OWN level, and not 'projected' onto. Even so, it's not exactly a ''stand out'' film: It ""IS"" from Thailand, after all -- a country not exactly notable for producing international hits, though they do seem to be getting much better at the game (you'll be hearing about a movie called ''SHUTTER'' soon enough, trust me).But if you're up for something that's a bit more heavy on the 'atmospheric' and 'moody,' and/or if you want to look at the ghost-story genre from one of the lesser-focused-on Asian countries, then it just might be worth your while. Otherwise, tread lightly -- try renting it first, if you can, and give it at least two good viewings before forming a opinion.",Bangkok Haunted

508613,"&lt;strong>The Sentinel&lt;/strong> (Michael Winner, 1977)I have, on occasion, gone back and watched beloved films from my childhood and youth to see if they have stood the test of time. It's been a sporadic thing to date, but I decided that this year I want to make a regular thing of it, and browsed Netflix until I found one I hadn't seen in at least twenty years: Michael Winner's &lt;em>The Sentinel&lt;/em>. I still have Jeffrey Konvitz' novel on the bookshelf, and I haven't read &lt;em>that&lt;/em> in easily thirty years, so some of what I have to say about the comparisons will be... hazy at best. (I will try and make sure the language reflects such when necessary.) But the bottom line is that when I first saw the movie, I had read the book &lt;em>very&lt;/em> recently, and I think that may have affected my judgment. Because &lt;em>The Sentinel&lt;/em> is a shallow, gratuitous film that is best remembered these days for having such a high-powered cast that Jeff Goldblum, Ron McLarty (in his first screen appearance), Tom Berenger (in his first feature appearance), and Nana Visitor (in HER first feature appearance) didn't manage to rate in either the main titles' A list OR B list, both of which contained over a dozen names. And let's not forget that both Richard Dreyfuss and Vicki Michelle make uncredited cameos. Is there ANYONE in this movie who wasn't on the A list at some point?Plot: Alison Parker (&lt;em>Nashville&lt;/em>'s Cristina Raines) wants some time away from her long-term boyfriend, high-powered attorney Michael Lerman (&lt;em>Fright Night&lt;/em>'s Chris Sarandon), so she gets a place on her own. In a Brooklyn Heights brownstone. Fully furnished. For four hundred dollars a month. That was wacko even in the seventies. Still, the estate agent, Miss Logan (the great Ava Gardner in one of her final big-screen appearances), is just as enthusiastic about the place as Alison is, it's got an amazing view, and what more could you possibly want? She takes it, and soon meets most of her crazy neighbors. There's Charles Chazen, who looks and sounds an awful lot like Burgess Meredith. As much as I love Burgess Meredith, he never could play anyone but Burgess Meredith. Then there's the creepy couple downstairs, Gerde (&lt;em>Midnight Cowboy&lt;/em>'s Sylvia Miles) and her paramour Sandra (Beverly D'Angelo, best-known these days for the National Lampoon's Vacation franchise). In fact, the only one she hasn't met is the blind priest in 5A, Father Halliran (John Carradine), but then, he's a recluse. Not long after moving in, Alison begins to have fainting spells, problems with her concentration (you wouldn't think that would be a problem for a model, but as one memorable scene with Goldblum and Jerry Orbach points out, it can be absolutely horrifying!), that sort of thing. Michael is understandably concerned, and he enlists Alison's best friend, Jennifer (&lt;em>God Told Me To&lt;/em>'s Deborah Raffin), a local expert in dead languages (&lt;em>Psycho&lt;/em>'s Martin Balsam), and even the Diocese of New York (represented here by Arthur Kennedy and Jose Ferrer). But that's not all... a couple of cops, Gatz and Rizzo (Eli Wallach and Christopher Walken), are convinced that Michael has something to do with Alison's problems, and that it all ties into Michael's previous wife's suicide, which may not have been a suicide at all...Phew. Plot synopsis? It's hard to cram all the A-listers in and get the relationships set up in less than five hundred words. And to be fair, there &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a plot to this mess, though I can't really tell you what it is since very little of it is revealed until the climax, and every major revelation leading up to it would also be a spoiler. But it all does have a point. Well, most of it has a point. The movie's major problem is that Winner jettisons most of what ties the more prurient scenes (including one featuring Ms. D'Angelo that her fans will want to watch the movie for, and a dream/hallucination sequence that may feature the most explicit gore scenes shown in a theatrically-released American feature film up to that time) to the plot, but leaves them in as shock set-pieces. They're memorable, but since they're not tied to anything, they feel somewhat anemic.As I said, I haven't read the book (or its sequel, &lt;em>The Guardian&lt;/em>, which was even more ludicrous) in dog's years, so maybe I'm misremembering it completely, but if I'm right about my initial reaction to the film all those years ago, my having read the book not long before seeing it allowed me to fit some pieces in place that would have otherwise made little sense had I come into the film cold. You might want to give the book a shot before watching this. ** ",N/A
729457,"A family of vaudevillians (Shirley Temple, Jack Oakie, and Charlotte Greenwood), quit show business and settle down on a farm out in the middle of nowhere Hicksville, populated by a community of vicious snobs (presumably Republicans as they are all against their resident Democrat newsman, George Montgomery).  Riding roughshod over the entire town is the aptly named Hester Appleby (Kathleen Howard).  ""She must have been weaned on a pickle.""  Naturally, the old fogies are all against `show folk.'  It doesn't help matters that not-so-little Shirley (as Wendy Ballantine) enlists the children of the town to put on a show guaranteed to irritate and incite the stogy old geezers into an apoplectic fit of grand proportions.  Poor Shirley finds out she's adopted then run out of town on the same day!  This was not her finest hour.  Shirley was no longer the cute little tap-dancing urchin of yore.  She was getting older, more awkward, unable to transition into age befitting roles.  It didn't help that this film felt like a throwaway, something that sat around for a hundred years that no one wanted to get stuck doing.  Some of the more maudlin scenes were excruciating to watch, feeling highly manufactured and disingenuous.  By the end of the film, I was feeling sorry for Shirley........for all the wrong reasons.",Young People VHS
1214964,"I was an avid Kevin Smith fan early in his career.  ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"", and ""Chasing Amy"" were inventive and original.  For the last ten years or so Smith seems to be resting on his laurels.  He seems to think a barrage of scatalogical dialogue and outrageous visual gags is creative.  It just gets numbing and tiresome after awhile.  Yes, there is a theme here in that can you fully divorce feeling from the sexual act if you truly love the one your with.  Noble sentiment but it's undermined by the barrage of crude humor.  Smith should look to his predecessors like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, and the Farrelly brothers to see how to pull this off.  Better yet is taking cues from Jud Apatow who probably could mined this material for all it's worth.  It seems like Smith is trying to push the envelope of what you can get away with in an ""R"" rated movie instead making something profound and lasting.

1300547,"Pixar has changed the way we look at animated films, and truly become the standard against the way we measure these sorts of movies in the 21st Century.  The detail that goes into the plot, character development, and animation is nothing but the best.  Unfortunately, Alpha and Omega isn't from the studio that gave us Buzz, Nemo, or Dug the Dog.  That's not to say it's a bad movie.  Just that its an `also ran'.The plot is harmless enough.  Kate and Humphrey are members of the same pack, but not of the same social standing.  Kate is an Alpha - a hunter and leader, driven and trained to be the very best.  Humphrey is a good-natured and loveable goofball who pals around with his buddies, rising to the occasion whenever absolutely necessary.  Sadly, Humphrey - an Omega - has feelings for Kate, and that's not just going to fly when it comes right down to pack law.  Think Romeo and Juliet for the Wild Kingdom set.But when the pair of wolves gets tranquilized and relocated hundreds of miles from home, the journey back gives them a chance to discover each other.  Sadly, the journey just doesn't live up to its potential.  You can see each plot development coming from a mile off.  We're also subjected to numerous jokes involving bodily functions and butts.Hayden Panettiere and Justin Long do a passable job as the star crossed Kate and Humphrey.  Dennis Hopper and Danny Glover also turn in decent efforts as the senior statesmen of the Wolf community.

For the great part of the film, it is clear and sharp.The title is actually ""The Trollenberg Terror"" but packaged under it's American release name.  This film holds suspense well, has some nice underplayed acting jobs and builds it's pace well enough to keep the viewer involved.  A United Nations science expert (B movie guy, Cameron Mitchell) is called to Switzerland to investigate a number of gruesome beheadings high in the Swiss Alps. Along the way Mitchell meets the usual pretty girl in these pictures but here, the girl travels with another girl, a clairvoyant(Janet Munro).  The creatures at the tops of Alps sense the clairvoyant and she can sense them.  This brings the film to its conflict as the ""Crawling Eyes"" have to take her out to remain undetected.

406071,"What shame. One of the finest musical films ever produced makes its (triumphant?) blu-ray debut boasting the same old transfer that was used for the DVD release a decade ago. First of all, let me say that if Warner Bros had been handling this release the film would have looked breathtaking. This not being the case, fans who have already purchased this release are left with egg on their face.The transfer used on this disc was fairly impressive for its time and looked rather brilliant on a standard definition TV. Why, even up-scaled and from a fair distance I have still been consistently impressed with the restoration work done in 1994 which was indeed substantial. But times have changed and standards have been raised with the advent of blu-ray. The only real difference here from the standard DVD would be that this ""new"" transfer has been ever-so-slightly up-scaled from what was either a standard definition source or an extremely lackluster HD source. Technically this disc is listed as having 1080p resolution, but to say that it even resembles 720p would be somewhat of a stretch. I would probably give this transfer the green-light for an HDTV airing, but not a high definition home video release by any means. If you have the 2-disc DVD edition, stick with that. The resolution appears exactly the same on an HDTV when up-scaled with a competent blu-ray player and all special features are present.To be fair to the people at Paramount, the original film elements that would form the foundation of any new film restoration may indeed still be in the hands of Warner Bros Studio. I am not entirely clear as to why the home video rights have shifted from the original studio which produced and released this picture, but it is very likely that Paramount was given a digital master to work with and nothing else. This is all speculation mind you, but you can rest assured that Warner would not likely hand the original elements over to Paramount/CBS nor are they legally obligated to do such a thing. I digress.The only (and I mean only) way I can recommend this disc is if either A) You don't own the movie at all and want the best transfer currently available WITH all of the current bonus features or B)You own the one-disc edition and feel like you're missing out on the special features from the 2004 special edition.The movie itself is a real gem. But I'm guessing if you're reading a review of the blu-ray you have already known this for quite some time. Buyer beware. A newer, far more satisfactory edition, will definitely be on the horizon in the next few years.",N/A

This is usually very easy for him, since he lives in Hawaii and has encounters with tourists who will quickly be flying away, never to bug him again. He is a veterinarian at an aquarium theme park, where his specialty is working with large sea mammals. He has a better rapport with the animals than with other people.One day, everything changes. He finds himself at an out-of-the-way waffle house where he first spots Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). He is instantly smitten and quickly makes conversation with her. They arrange to see each other the next morning. He shows up and resumes their conversation, only to see her get &quot;weirded out&quot; and wondering why he is behaving the way he is.  The waitress explains Lucy's problem to Henry. After a head injury received in a car wreck, she cannot save short term memories into long-term memories... her slate is wiped clean each night when she sleeps.The film's trailers fail to show the crude sexual humor peppered through out the film and only highlight the sweet sappy flavor of this seemingly doomed romance.  When the film was being conceived, they writers no doubt had a lot of laughs and threw in gags and jokes here and there, but didn't have the wisdom to leave some of them on the cutting room floor. First the film is a comedy, then a disgusting sexual parody, then a tragedy, then a sappy romance flick, then a &quot;happily ever after&quot; film - but it does not do well in all these roles.Sean Astin portrays Doug, Lucy's steroid-abusing brother with a bad lisp and not much between the ears. This character simply was not necessary, and if snipped, could have spared the viewer 10-15 minutes of mental drivel.Then there's Henry's aquarium assistant, Alexa (Lusia Strus), who by virtue of being plain and flat-chested has been made out as an androgenous bisexual who is the butt of jokes, including being sprayed on by walrus vomit.  It's as though this woman has no feelings, just happy and randy at all times, even though she is treated like garbage. This character could have also been eliminated, spared the viewer another 10 minutes of eye-rolling, and made the romance and drama portion of the movie that much more enjoyable.Lucy's brain injury is no laughing matter and at times, the movie addresses this, as she goes through the mental trauma of daily reliving the fact that each day is another lie, as when she wakes up each morning, she has no idea that a year has gone by.  To make Lucy feel better, Dr. Keats (Dan Akroyd) introduces Lucy to &quot;Ten Second Tom&quot; who lost a portion of his brain during a hunting accident, so he can only remember things for 10 seconds. This is incredibly tragic, yet made as a comic relief gag.Ula (Rob Schneider) is Henry's best friend and coworker at the aquarium. While also an improbable character, is a hilarious character and a fun side-kick for comic relief... although he can be quite crude as well.As with every character that Adam Sandler has ever played on the big screen, his character is a pathetic lonely man whose heart is forever changed by one magical moment and a special warm-hearted woman who gives him focus and purpose in life... and then after some drama, they live happily ever after. It's a good formula, but a good 30 minutes could have been snipped from the film and it would have been much better in the long run.The content is so highly valued by the filmmakers, however, that everyone at the screening I attended was searched for any recording devices... another indication that they took every portion of the film so seriously, they weren't able to stand back and with some tough love, edit out the less savory portions and make it a more palatable film.In the end, the film evokes real tears and some real belly laughs, but like a rollercoaster ride after eating a monster chili dog, sometimes the thrills aren't worth pain.  Fun to watch, but I never have to see it again.",N/A
957790,"I was a late bloomer when it came to Doctor Who. Sure I had heard of him but my best friend had watched him for years before I sat down and watched one with him. Even then although I found it slightly interesting, I wasn't a fan yet. Two wifes later I was. Yes it was the women in my life that truly helped me develop an appreciation for Doctor Who. It became evident that I missed his true benefit, relaxation. The Doctor more than anything is a great relaxer. He may even put you to sleep. I don't mean this in an insulting way at all. It's just that even if it doesn't have the best acting, effects, sets, et cetera, it still will be interesting and relaxing. The Doctor is something you can do something else and run in the background and listen and appreciate. I say this because we have watched the episodes so many times we pretty much know them by heart. Although I love Tom Baker and Peter Davison, and I enjoy Jon Pertwee and Sylvester McCoy, I can only take Colin Baker in small doses, and I don't have  much interest in Hartnell and Troughton in the Black and White episodes. If they sell the whole set at a far better price I might be interested, but at this kind of cost no way. I have gradually bought the ones we truly enjoy and am now getting all the episodes of the doctors we like until then. The individual episodes I have purchased are only mediocre picture and sound quality and they do not contain extras. If they are priced above $20 be sure it is more than one episode. Otherwise it is overpriced. If you enjoy these catch ""Red Dwarf"" and the new ""Doctor Who"" TV series.CA Luster",N/A

168955,"Solidly anchored in the superficial, non psychedelic part of the 60s, the perfectly named MATT HELM LOUNGE (Sony) is a four DVD set (The Silences, Murderers' Row, The Ambushers and The Wrecking Crew) that features Dean Martin as Matt Helm, the wise-cracking, boozing, smoking, singing, swinging, fighting, seducing secret agent who never gets his well-oiled hair mussed.Cool, urbane and loaded with an arsenal of handy double-entendres, Martin's Helm is a James Bond parody who fights evil geniuses with world dominating schemes all the while sorting through a bevy of good and bad beauties wearing exotic, often skimpy attire. That's the formula for these sexy, silly spy romps, replete with generous samplings of Martin's trademark crooning.The best of the lot is 1966's The Silencers. The first title in the series has Helm up against a villain who wants to take over the world by starting World War III.  Stella Stevens is his klutzy, knock-out cohort.It's interesting that these films with their then preposterous plots are now issues we have already faced or fears for which we are on alert.

1647014,"In DreamWorks ""The Croods"" a prehistoric family embarks on the very first road trip ever!  After their cave is destroyed, they must go in search of a new home - with the help of a handsome stranger named Guy.Who are The Croods?  They are Dreamwork's rendition of a caveman family - the father, Grug, is always warning his family about the dangers outside.  He wants to keep his family safe - ""in the dark.""Grug has a wife and a restless teenage daughter named Eep - there is also a not-too-bright overweight son, a strange growling baby, and a crusty grandma character.  Then along comes Guy - a handsome stranger (with a cute pet named Belt) who lives for adventure and ""following the sun.""  Eep is in love.  Grug is none too thrilled.Guy leads the Crood family through a very colorful prehistoric CG landscape filled with all sorts of neon bright fanciful and furry critters that happen to have very large teeth.  Adventures ensues - despite the fact Grug is completely against them ensuing.  Will the family find a new home?  Or will they get eaten up by one of the many weird surrealistic creatures?  Will Grug and Guy ever get along?  After all, Guy is so different.  He uses his brain and comes up with brand new ideas.  Grug believes in just relying on his brawn.  Well, to find the answers to these questions, you'll just have to watch the movie and see.The visuals in this movie are fantastic.  Lots of interesting and colorful ""eye candy"" to keep little kids transfixed.  However.....and it's a BIG however...I feel the story leaves a bit to be desired - from an adult standpoint.  Like I said, little kids will no doubt love it.  But the plot is just so clich&eacute; and typical....the humor is so lazy and un-clever it makes you want to yawn (think:  Hotel Transylvania).  I think I chuckled twice during the whole film - and I thought it was going to be an outrageous comedy!!!  Not so.  The Croods is not clever and sophisticated like the Shrek movies.  It is even less sophisticated than the Ice Age movies, in my opinion.The characters are not very unique - you never really warm up to any of them, like you do with Shrek or Donkey or even Sid the Sloth.  Eep as the teenage daughter is so woefully predictable.  And what's with the weird hourglass figure and overly shapely legs?  Is that really necessary for a kid's movie?Certain comments Grug makes about ""killing the grandma"" struck me as disturbing.  I know it's just supposed to be comedy, but still...The thing that bothered me the most about the movie, is that it literally hits you over the head with too much sappy family ""I love you's""....it seemed forced.Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the movie - as you can probably tell!  I recommend you see it once - just for the visuals...but maybe rent before buying.  Unless you have a child under 10 - then go ahead and purchase the movie.  They'll love it!",N/A
263195,"LITTLE LAURA AND BIG JOHN was one of the many indie quickies that once appeared as the bottom half of a Drive-In movie double feature way back when summer and youth seemed inexhaustible. Movies like this weren't really meant to be watched closely-- they were designed as wallpaper to the private activities of backseated teens all across the U.S.Make no mistake about it: this is clumsily put-together. LL&BJ; has the feel of a crude student film, and yet, what was originally meant as a cinematic trifle best forgotten over a slice of late-nite pizza has with the passage of a third of a century somehow gained in value. The story is loosely based on a real outlaw gang-- one that operated in rural South Florida in the 1920s. A half-century later, much of their stomping grounds remained as they'd been decades earlier. To now see the natural beauty we've since traded for pavement, strip malls and multiplex theaters is poignantly melancholic.The film's narrative songs, like ""Goin' to Jacksonville"" or ""Everybody Likes it Up at Raiford,"" are positively laughable. For ex-teen idol Fabian Forte, ""Big John"" was hardly a bright spot on his acting resume, while Karen Black managed to survive her ""Little Laura"" misstep unscathed. Several others appearing here define the word ""amateur,"" while many bit players were locals with zero acting experience.So, who should see this film? South Floridians, certainly. Karen Black fans, maybe.

596273,"Sci-Fi thrillers are always good to watch. Speilberg gives us a real treat and this is certainly one of Speilberg's darkest films to date. Minority Report has more in common with Schindler's List and Blade Runner than it does with Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Jurassic Park. This is new ground for Spielberg and having bombed with A.I. it is certainly a better direction for him to move in.Tom Cruise is at the helm of this futuristic crime busting lab that is able to predict serious felonies before they happen by way of three psychics that are hooked into the system. His display of manipulating their imagination and dreams among a big glass digital screen is almost done with the same wizardry that Speilberg edits his own films. Speilberg's thoughts are on form in Minority Report and most of the movie is big and wild in a vast dreamscape. Speilberg does not leave it at that though. He manages to actually hunk in a tense action thriller full of suspense about a man on the run from his own system. It is also full of brains and creative imagery. Who can forget Cruise chasing his own eyes as they roll down the hall? ""What!"" you say? Yes, Speilberg has gone a bit loco here and it pays off in aces.Who can also forget the performance of Colin Farrell who actually manages to convincingly try to outperform Cruise on the screen, even though this is one of his first mainstream films. This flick is as much Farrell's as it Cruise's and boy does he make sure of that.I will not spoil the plot but it has something to do with Cruise predicting his own felony which involves a homicide of man who may have kidnapped and murdered his son. Speilberg cues lots of actions, sci-fi extraordinaires, genuine detective work and throws in a who dunnit' to cap it all off. Make no mistake about it. Minority Report is a fast fury of unstoppable set pieces to boot.Unfortunately Speilberg does not deliver on the last fifth of the film. Here he goes for double-jeopardy when maybe he should have just stayed put. The extra fifteen minutes tries to turn the chase on the bad guys instead and unfortunately never lives up to what the first 2 hours of magic gave us. In fact it is cheesy and out of kilter with the rest of the film. It feels a bit contrived and certainly is devoid of the suspense that we witnessed throughout this great sci-fi fest. What does it end up doing? You come away feeling that you should have left fifteen minutes ago. It was such a shame to have been on the edge of your seat for most of it only now to be sitting there gawking at your watch and wondering if you are looking at a reel from another movie that projectionist tagged on by accident.When all is said and done the movie is inescapable enchantment but is marred by a terrible ending whatever way you look at it and it does lower the quality of this fine film considerably.",N/A

931251,"This an interesting slasher flick that takes place in a secluded mansion in the Italian country side.  The cinematography is beautiful and the women are gorgeous.  However, outside of the few slasher scenes there really isn't much to this movie.  Stephen King obviously has seen this movie because there's a few incredible similarities to his novel The Shining.We have a failed alcoholic novelist (sound familiar?) obsessed with his dead mother who sadistically abuses his timid wife who is terrified of their black cat named Satan.  When his mistress is brutally murdered, his wife suspects him of being responsible and the body count begins.  Who's the killer?  Could it be the novelist who is prone to alcohol induced black outs?  Could it be his timid wife?  Perhaps it's the shadowy figure that appears just before some one is murdered?  Maybe it's the ghost of his mother possessing the cat or his sexy niece who suddenly shows up on their door step?This is a fairly slow moving misogynistic film with a lot of unnecessary  nudity and sex but it was the early 70s so it's understandable.  The end is pretty good in an Edgar Allen Poe kind of way but first you have to trudge through several long drawn out scenes of sex and nudity before the final payoff.Recommended only for true fans of Italian ""giallo"" horror.

808034,"As soon as I could digest the fact that this movie advertised Tom Cruise as a Samurai I became excited by what appeared to be an epic saga about Japans tumultuous transition from millenia old traditionalism, into the modern era.  I figured, at the least, Samurai are interesting to watch; right?  Plus Edward Zwick (the Director) was the dude who also directed Glory...Gobs of money were spent on the finest talent, set design, musical production, and effects........and it all shows.  This movie is beautiful to look at and interesting to watch.  Too bad it has about as much meaning as a plate of dog barf.Those looking for the substance of Glory (or a South Park episode for that matter) are in for grave disapointment. But before you get all worked up and angry about that, consider the movies basic premise:War weary mercenary enlists his services to the Japanese Imperial Army (not as some of the reviews contend ""to crush the Samurai"", but rather to modernize the military and keep it competitive with the rest of the world).  A rogue Samurai (Katsumoto) takes up arms against the evil Imperial Army (headed by the Emperor) to defend the ""way of the Samurai"" and the ancient (inarguably beautiful) way of life they preserve.Ok, a little wobbly, but it gets way more conflicted.  Almost as if they started making the movie before they took the basic philosophical premise to its logical end...Following below are some of the conflicts that made this movie a ""hero agnostic"", conflicted, collage of plot-slop.The Samurai, as cool as they were, were dead meat.  They used swords!  Sure, they used them well, very well (and some arrows too), but one word ""machine gun"" (ok, two).  Hello?!!  The whole purpose of a Samurai is to defend their masters (typically the ruling class).  With the advent of modern weaponry, their refusal to change with the times negated their worth to ""useless"".  Many of them stepped aside, this story is about one moron who didn't (Katsumoto), and instead caused the death of just about every innocent, selfless, loving person under his guardianship.Ok, it'd be one thing if ""the enemy"" was real, but the enemy was led by the Emperor, his sworn master.  Sure, the Emperor was being influenced by greedy counsel, but in the movie, at every juncture of opportunity, Katsumoto acted like some hot-headed blood thirsty baby.  Even when the Emperor granted him special audience to to plead his case, he TOTALLY deferred to the Emperors judgment.Well, the Emperor needed to modernize Japan.  The Samurai were finished.  But I guess that wouldn't sell tickets, so we had to watch Katsumoto lead all those that were sworn to him into a completely futile attempt to fight the machine gun toting opposition.  Kinda cool I guess.  That is, if you're not the kind to be bothered by the fact that this kind of mindless leadership (and more importantly mindless obedience) is the cause of most all of mankinds war and resultant gore, broken bodies, broken civilizations, and broken families.Hey, I love war movies (Empire of the Sun stands as one of my favorites), and I don't need a ""pure hero"" to root for.  But this movie actually had me rooting for ""the dark side"", at least their position made some sense.",N/A

221911,"Corruption of the New York City police is actually a subject I'm quite interested in as I lived there for many years and had many unpleasant encounters with the NYPD. It is widely known that  unprofessionalism and lax ethics runs rampant to this day throughout the force, and it is readily apparent in the way they treat ordinary citizens on the street to say nothing about protestors, minorities, or at times even elected officials.The best parts of Serpico do a fine job of portraying the subtle and not-so-subtle pushing and prodding, the hazing that goes underway with cops. But Pacino chose to play this part as something of the antithesis of Michael Corleone and I actually found his character rather uncompelling. He kind of does this compromised ""staring of into the distance"" thing with his acting (a man caught in the middle) throughout the film, and then gets annoyed in a couple of scenes. The real Frank Serpico has a nasally, annoying voice and Pacino incorporated this into his character -- but the whole thing comes across as kind of half-baked and even corny -- he's the hepcat hiPpiE cOp. You can tell that everyone at the studio and behind the scenes played up this angle to the extreme. Only it just sits on the surface.So tonally the film is very preachy and way overlong, shot in a kind of docudrama style that has message written all over it. Although Lumet was known for his ""gritty"" style, I have always found it workmanlike. I never got the feel for the energy of New York street of the early 70s from Serpico, nor much of the inspiration for the lead character wanting to be a cop in the first place. This is a ""man in the middle"" film that is so enamored with its theme of urban corruption it just never hits its stride. Serpico does deserve some credit for exposing the despicable behavior of many NYPD cops and its culture, but apparently the book is much better than the film.",Serpico VHS
790282,"I know that Meg Ryan feared the typecasting system, and she's worried that if she was to make another ""crowd-pleaser"" romantic comedy, audiences would get sick of her being the American sweetheart again and again. So she really deserve the credit for having the courage to surprise her fans with this provokative and daring sexual thriller. She goes to the dark side so that she can broaden her range as a actress. Everyone who had seen Jane Campion's films such as The Piano(Holly Hunter) or Portrait of a Lady(Nicole Kidman), were eager to see how she managed to transform Ryan into a different kind of woman. Afterall, she's so good at creating brilliant female roles. Unfortunately, the result is rather mediocre, not that Meg Ryan didn't submit herself emotionally and physically(she had some nudity) to this film, but it's because the script is weak, and it's hard for a viewer like myself to feel any sympathy towards her character.It's a kinky and mysterious experience for Ryan to endure in this film that covers murder, sex, manipulation(head game played by the twisted and highly sexualized cop/Mark Ruffalo). She's drawn to the mysterious and dangerous aspect of love and vulnerable to explore despite the dangerous consquences she might encounter. This film is dark in terms of the story and the lighting as well. It really doesn't have the artsy look of The Piano at all.Jennifer Jason Leigh is inappropiately cast as Ryan's sister, and she had little to do with minimal screen time. Mark Ruffalo tried his very best with his corrupted character, but I can't see him in this kind of roles, especially when his You Can Count On Me performance is so heartbreaking and totally opposite of this film.I know this film has been somewhat of a failure for both Campion and Ryan, because it bombed at the box office, and didn't have good reviews from critics and viewers, but it will always be the movie that had changed the way people see Meg Ryan.",N/A
1363374,"Since it is not possible to rate performances individually (in which case I would rate Dessay's Zerbinetta five stars), and there are too many negatives (personal preferences) for me to rate the overall performance other than the three stars. Moshinsky's production is adequate in the Prologue and almost non-existent in the opera proper. The conceit of 18th century staging of classical myths in the dress of the time is not a new one. Perhaps it does Ms. Voigt a favor, but I would like to think that she could have been costumed more appropriately in the similar setting that is used in the the film from the Vienna State Opera. She is not the most gifted of singing actresses (perhaps the weight loss has made a difference) moving by the numbers and gesturing in a manner that seems (to me) artificial and contrived. As to the singing I have to admit that I never counted myself in her camp,  but her delivery of the two arias is quite stunning and she easily rises to the challenge. I wonder if she could sing them as well today? Her tenor is quite un-god like, barking and in general singing with little or no distinction. The role is difficult, not too long, but it does require a heldentenor with a good top. It is not uncommon to farm it out to tenors who simply take it on as a job. The one time they didn't was the recording (live) that celebrated the birthday of Strauss: the tenor was Max Lorenz. Alas no one has met that standard set in war time Austria. The rest of the cast was pretty good too!The real star is Dessay, pre vocal difficulties. While in essence I would prefer a German trainied voice (Streich, et. al.) Dessay is quite brilliant, negotiating all the difficulties vocal and otherwise that Strauss wrote. In addition she is so comfortable on the stage that even if her singing weren't as good as it is she would steal the evening. I have admit that I prefer her to the reigning Zerbinetta of the last thiry years, Gruberova. Again, personal preference.In a number of recordings the singer chosen to sing the Composer can be mentioned in the same sentence as the Prima Donna/Ariadne and Zerbinetta. Those were the days when we had Seefried, Jurinac and Zylys Gara. Today mezzos have taken over the role; it doesn't lie that high and a good lyric mezzo should have no strain with top notes. Susanne Mentzer sings the role well, but one only has to hear Seefried (either recording) and Jurinac to hear (and in the case of Juriniac) and see the difference. She does give a good performance and has clearly has thrown herself in the role. As compared with the others currently available in DVD she can be rated very highly.Among the four sets I have, my own personal preference is for the Zurich performance with Emily Magee. She comes closer to to my ideal Ariadne (Cebotari) than any other soprano, combining a radiant soprano voice, great beauty and technique. I will admit that the production is doubtless too outre for most auditors, especially if only one DVD is to be had. Additionally the Bacchus, Roberto Sacca, is only marginally superior to Marginson vocally and carrying far fewer pounds--a visual advantage. The Zerbinetta is the house soprano who will make her Met debut this year, Mosuc. She is several light years from Dessay and Gruberova. Had the Janowitz version been a live performance it doubtless would be the main contender, but it is hardly fair to compare a film with live performances. The Dresden performance should not be overlooked; it afterall was one of the houses that used to compete for Strauss premiers. The Ariadne/Prima Donna, Susan Anthony, is really very good and Sophie Koch another mezzo an excellent Composer. The Zerbinetta is workmanlike and she negotiates the difficulties adequately if not memorably. Colin Davis in a repertroire that one doesn't usually associate with him has the measure of the score.Given the options for the  opera lover who wants an Ariadne in their collection I suspect that this current set will satisfy their needs. Only a curmugeon such as myself will be bothered by objections I have noted.",Richard Strauss: Ariadne auf Naxos - James Levine Celebrating  40 Years at the Met

564326,"Alright, I'm back and I've rented it.  And the verdict is--well, not all bad. Not GOOD--not by any means--but not all bad.First off: the plot was okay.  It wasn't solid, and it doesn't stand up to any sort of scrutiny, but had this been a stand-alone and not a cheap-quel, it might have worked.  Maybe. The story was cliche. The tough girl is really a softie and she helps the naive guy.  I KNOW it's cliche, but I love that cliche.  It's too bad they didn't pull it off well. The characters made constant contradictions of themselves.  This thing might have worked if Scamp HAD actually been ""kind and decent"", or if Buster really DID think that ""Buster's trouble is Buster's trouble"".  ""But, hey, it's a kid's movie!  It doesn't need PLOT!""  Yeah, right!Animation: The norm for these Disney rip-offs is that the clean-up is nice, and a couple of seconds of animation are nice, with lots of inbetweens to fool the consumer into believing that this is quality animation.  Well, this followed suit, with a lot of sudden action and acting that didn't really help any of the character development or establishment.  Oh, and there were bad 3-D effects, as well.  No, wait--by ""bad"" I only mean ""really, REALLY OBVIOUSLY not hand-drawn"".  They might have been nice in an all 3-D movie, but they were horrible against these hand-drawn backgrounds.Third, if you're going to make a cheap-quel of something that's already MORE than resolved enough, at least stick with the original in SOME REMOTE WAY.  Okay?  I mean, they tried--they replicated the backgrounds and layout--but they didn't bother with the most important things like personality.  Tramp, after 6 months (in movie time), had had a complete personality transplant!  He turned from the cocky, charming rogue into the preachy, overbearing, unskilled father.  Lady lost any life or spark she once had.  Because, of course, moms and dads don't have ANY personality of their own, right?  They're just ""Mom"" and ""Dad"". Right? Wrong!  I mean, yeah, there would be some adjustment for Tramp in a family, but he NEVER got mad in the first movie.  He was so relaxed-sounding and charming!  Sure, the replacement voice had the same kind of sound to his voice, but all the cockiness and  whimsy of the original voice was gone and he just sounded--I don't know, FALSE.The thing that they lost the most, however, was the relationship between the people and the dogs.  In the first movie, the dogs were really DOGS.  Yeah, they had some human action (e.g. talking), but you could TELL that they were dogs becausea) the animation kept enough dog action/anatomy in these clearly human actions--i.e. characteristic dog lips and teeth, even though the dog is talking; Tramp rolls over laughing at Jock and Trustyb) the way they thought of humans was inherently doggish--calling the man ""Jim-dear"" and the woman ""Darling""; running out to meet Jim-dear when he came home, etc.So, this movie really only deserves two stars.

What I got instead was a sporadically charming but surprisingly earthbound little fantasy that had me pining away over lost opportunities with the Lost Generation.The conceit - not terribly original in and of itself but filled with promise and possibilities - involves an American writer visiting modern-day Paris who is whisked away every midnight to the 1920s where he hobnobs with many of the great writers, artists and thinkers of the time: F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and others.So far, so good.  Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is portrayed as a hopeless romantic who, as we are too often wont to do, believes that life was better in a time before he was born - an idealized era where life was richer, simpler and somehow more satisfying than it is today.  For Gil, that ideal period is the Paris of the 1920s, which he envisions as a scene of endless literary and intellectual discussions amongst a rarified elite.  He's engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a much more prosaic 21st Century woman, whose father (Kurt Fuller) is a right-wing tea-party type and whose mother (Mimi Kennedy) looks with disdain on her daughter's life choices, including the man she`s picked to marry.  No wonder Gil rushes back every night to that space/time continuum portal that allows him to be with the people he really likes and who seem to like and understand him.The main problem for me with ""Midnight in Paris"" is that it is unable to bring its roster of extraordinary historical figures to life.  In fact, they emerge basically as some of the blandest people you are ever likely to meet, this century or last.  They wouldn't even make a good cocktail party crowd.  Not one of them says anything insightful or witty that would in any way indicate that they are world-famous artists and creators of lasting works.  And without that dimension, Gil's trips to the past have all the excitement and authenticity of a dress-up ball that never ends.The scenes set in the present are scarcely any better.  Inez' family and their pompous, know-it-all friend, played by Michael Sheen, are just the Ugly American writ large, and the humor is surprisingly toothless and lacking for a Woody Allen movie.  Wilson, who has been effective in other roles, here feels too much like a stand-in for a younger version of Allen himself to make much of an impression of his own.So what of the glorious views of Paris that one would expect from such a film?  Surely, those are worth the price of admission.  Actually, not really, for the cinematographer, Darius Khonji, has, for some inexplicable reason, seen fit to cast the city in a strangely sickly yellowish glow that robs the place of much of its natural beauty and luster.So what is good about the film?  Well, there are some genuinely tender moments between Gil and Adriana, the on-again/off-again mistress of Pablo Picasso, who suffers from Gil's idealization of the past, only to her, that rosier past lies in the era known as La Belle Epoque.  And there's a very funny in-movie scene in which Gil gives a bemused and befuddled Luis Bunuel the idea for what the surrealist will later turn into ""The Exterminating Angel.""  The movie also does a nice job fleshing out its theme - of the illusion of a Golden Age vs. the reality of a present day - in the final reel.More virtues like these and ""Midnight in Paris"" might have been the truly transporting charmer it was meant to be.",N/A

Unlike other animated films that were made in widescreen and were cropped in pan-and-scan fullscreen (where it crops the sides of the screen), this movie (along with other Don Bluth films from ""The Secret of NIMH"" to ""The Pebble and the Penguin"") was made in fullscreen to begin with. So nothing is cropped out, all the top and bottom of the picture is shown (the widescreen version crops out the top and bottom when shown in that presentation). And one problem I have with it is that they added some new voices and sound effects along with re-dubbed versions of alley mice's voices. That sucks.

1035874,"To be honest, if it hadn't had the ""Robotech"" label on, it would have gotten two stars (or less...).  I've been an avid Robotech fan since I was introduced to the novels back in 1991 (missed it when it first aired on TV).  I went on to read all of the books multiple times and caught every episode at least twice while it was aired on the Sci-Fi channel.  I've built the models, played the RPG and am a retular visitor to robotech.com, so I was, obviously, looking forward to this movie for quite some time.  I should have learned by now that nothing ever lives up to the hype.  Granted, this movie is really only a pilot episode by HG to see just how much $$$ Robotech is still capable of bringing in (hey, money makes the world go round), but they may have alienated more fans than they brought in with this one.  I hate to say it, but first and foremost - as numerous people have already mentioned - the women were so rediculously out of proportion it was like I was watching an episode of Love Hina.  Robotechs light-hearted silliness is based on substance, not rediculous drawings, I mean, c'mon, did a h*rny 13-year-old make that call?  Next, on to the animation quality.  Overall, the animation was ok (hard lines and weak shading not withstanding), but the CG stuff was really disappoinging.  The veritechs looked pretty good, but movement was akward and often choppy.  The explosions ranged from pretty good to just plain lousy.  The ships weren't too bad, but the invid didn't really do it for me either.  I guess CG is the wave of the future, but it will never be able to take the place of hand-drawn animation.  The story and characters also left a lot to be desired - many MAJOR characters were not present or even mentioned.  Rumor has it that some were killed off, while others will 'make their appearance' if another installment is ever made.  The familiar voices were definitely a plus though.  I was more than glad to see just how many of the original cast made it back.  In conclusion, this episode didn't add ALL that much to the story, but it did end rather abruptly to leave us hanging.  As a die-hard Robotech fan, you may feel compelled to buy it, but I urge you to rent, even if it means more won't be made.",Robotech - The Shadow Chronicles Movie
290249,"""Cinema Paradiso"" (1989) was a great and much loved movie, written and directed by  Giuseppe Tornatore (Mal&egrave;na). The 2003 ""director's cut (""Cinema Paradiso: The New Version"") shows that the cutting, credited to Mario Morra (Battle of Algiers, Burn!) was work of genius. That is, what was cut, primarily the story of the film-maker's lost love with a girl from an elite family, swamped the story of the boy Toto and the town's misanthropic film-projectionist Alfredo (the Basset-hound-faced French actor Philippe Noiret dubbed into Italian, as in his other greatest screen triumph, ""Il Postino"") and the magic of movies. Young lovers torn apart has, um, been done before and done better, and those who loved the version of ""Cinema Paradiso"" that won shelves of award may be curious about the postadolescent story of Toto, but 29 of the 30 interim years is not in the 47 minutes that had been put back either. The longer story turns Alfredo into a darker (not to mention meddlesome) character. As the adolescent Toto, Marco Leonardi (Like Water for Chocolate) is pleasant to look at, but the compelling performances are those of Noiret and of Salvatore Cascio as the child Toto.5 stars for the released version, 3 for the director's uncut one. The DVD has both versions. For anyone who has not seen the movie, I would strongly recommend starting with the 1989 version. Then, a viewer who wants to know more will likely discover or relearn that ""less can be more,"" and, more specifically, that a masterpeice was cut out of a fairly mediocre love story.",N/A
573816,"In the ancient days of the early '80s, many Conan-imitation fantasies stalked the land. Most of them were cheap, dreary, and unwatchable. But the best of this low-budget bunch was the successful 1982 flick, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer."" Director Albert Pyun has gone onto to direct a slew of very cheesy movies, often featuring kickboxing, but this is his best film. People who love brawny sword-swingin' action will get a kick out of it. Yes, it's done cheaply, but there's some honest imagination in it, and the plot -- although filled with massive holes as deep as torture pits -- actually seems as if the writers took some time to think it up. The story still follows the basic clich&eacute;s of this type of fantasy -- saving princesses, a vengeance-seeking hero, a resurrected evil wizard -- but it flows well and keeps you interested.Of course,the film has tons of problems, and anyone who isn't seriously into the fantasy genre or early 80s movies will probably hate it. The sets are inexpensive and unimpressive, the photography cramps the action to stretch the budget, visual effects are minimal, and the acting is at best only adequate (but still better than most films of this kind). Lee Horsley plays the wise-cracking hero Talon, who wields a silly but rather cool three-bladed sword. Talon joins the resistance against evil King Cromwell (veteran b-movie villain Richard Lynch) in order to rescue a princess (Kathleen Beller). Behind it all lurks a monstrous sorcerer (Richard Moll under some well-done make-up) who has it in for Cromwell for betraying him and manipulates the resistance for his own ends. The story builds up to a surprisingly exciting finale that flexes some furious muscle and spills copious amounts of blood.Unlike fantasy movies made today, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" is adult in tone: the violence gets quite bloody and extreme, and casual nudity is sprinkled throughout. The DVD from Anchor Bay is an adequate presentation. The picture is letterboxed and enhanced for widescreen TVs. There is some grain, but the well-lit scenes look quite clear. The sound comes in 2.0 surround and 5.1. The 5.1 mostly expands the music to the back speakers, but it sound good considering the age and budget of the film. The only extras are two trailers (almost exactly the same) and a TV spot. As usual with Anchor Bay, there are no subtitles whatsoever, not even in English.For night with people who love sword-slashing fun and don't mind some silly budget-cutting, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" is a good bet.",The Sword and the Sorcerer
1647493,"Robert le Diable (Robert the Devil)  -  composed by Giacomo Meyerbeer  (1791- 1864), with  libretto  by Eug&egrave;ne Scribe and Germain Delavigne - was  one of the first grand operas performed at the Paris Op&eacute;ra  Theater back in 1831.  It  is a very long work,  consisting  of  five acts developing over a period of  211 minutes, or  three and a half  hours!!!The plot is loosely based on old legends about William the Conqueror,  officially the son of a duke of Normandy,  but  allegedly fathered by  the devil  himself:  he  was  born in answer to prayers addressed to the  forces of evil.  The time is the Middle Ages, the place  Palermo, Sicily  (in a tavern, at a palace, in the countryside and in a cathedral).  The language is  French, with subtitles available in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean.The story is rather complex.  Main theme  is the  eternal conflict between  good and evil,  developing  in this case through  the  moral redemption of  Robert (no last name),  son of a beautiful and  virtuous princess,  and of the devil himself.  Predictably, given his origins, Robert is pulled in opposite directions  by the devil - disguised as his friend Bertram (in reality  his own  father, although  unbeknownst to him until the very end) - and by an angelic figure named Alice  (his foster sister,  standing in for  his mother who recently passed away).  Both characters  try to secure  Robert&#8217;s soul for their respective final destinations, hell and heaven.  During the final act, Robert is about to sign the  papers which would officially turn him into a devil.  But, not unexpectedly,  the positive forces  prevail, he is finally free to move in the right direction  and  marries Isabelle,  Princess of Sicily,  another angelic figure, for whom he has been yearning throughout  the opera.Robert le Diable premiered at the Paris Op&eacute;ra on  November 21 1831,  and was an immediate success.  Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, who was in the audience, is reported to have said:  ""If ever magnificence was seen in the theatre, I doubt that it reached the level of splendour shown in Robert le Diable ...  It is a masterpiece&#8230;..  Meyerbeer has made himself immortal"".The opera  remained popular during Mayerbeer&#8216;s  life and - following his death -  until  the end  of the 19th century.During  the twentieth century, Robert le Diable  - along with the rest of  Meyerbeer&#8217;s work -  was still occasionally performed,  but lost much of its popularity, partly because of the expenses required for  the staging,  partly because of some unfair defamation  by the  Wagner  supporters.The present production was recorded  at  Covent Garden, in London, on December 15 2012, with the Royal Opera Chorus and Orchestra, under the baton of Daniel Oren.  Unfortunately,  the performance  received a poor review (three stars out of five)  in  the London paper  &#8220;The Guardian&#8220;,  following the premiere performance, on December  7  the  2012 .  The entire review, starting with &#8220;What are we to make of Robert le Diable in the 21st century?&#8221;  is available through the link:  [...]I tend to agree with  the Guardian.  Basically, the music is beautiful from beginning to end, no way of denying it.  But the staging, the costumes (some of which are just  plain funny), some of the acting, some of the dance scenes - including the &#8220;Dance of the Fallen Nuns&#8221; - lack the creative force that  made the original opera a  great success.The three stars from &#8220;The Guardian&#8221; seem like a fair rating.",Meyerbeer: Robert le diable
600207,"DS9's writing in this first season was a little poor--it lacked development and explanation.  It is always disappointing when something interesting develops, then is entirely ignored and unexplained.  Characters also often acted, well, out of character.  They would do things entirely unlike themselves and completely below their capabilities because the writers found it more convenient to write it that way.However, it is entertaining.  Some of the characters are very interesting.  Although this season is often far too topical and offers far less for discovery than it should, it is still fun to watch.The DVD setup was remarkably poorly designed.  The format for the episode selections is terrible.  We had to look at the box to figure out what sequence they aired in.  The extras on the last disk  are even worse.  They are randomly scattered around the screen, usually without even a description of what they are.  And they're FULL of spoilers about the rest of the entire series!!  Instead of just a perspective about the particular season, they talked about the entire series and gave away a lot of info as to what happens in later seasons.  It's like they gave no thought at all to the format and setup of the DVD's.I gave it three stars, because there's a balance between enjoying the episodes and having to deal with the poorly-conceived presentation of them.",N/A
1090919,"The opening scene of this film immediately drew me in.  I found the scene in which Robert Carlyle decides to abandon his wife to save his own life utterly gut wrenching to watch.  I watch a lot of horror movies and am not easily shocked but for some reason a few scenes in the film really hit me.  I kept thinking of ""what if"" scenarios and how would I react in this situation.  Would I be humane or do what it takes to save myself just to survive.  The only reason this film didn't receive 5 stars from me is not because it wasn't a worth sucessor to the original but because of all of the little unbelievable details that seemed to happen throughout the movie.Pros+ Brutal opening and a few other tough scenes to watch, usually when the ""rage"" infected are attacking their victims.+ Very few slow moments and since the infected move just as fast as every one else there's not the typical run, hide and wait for the zombies to get me.+ The atmosphere of the film was very tense and I found myself tensing up several times without realizing it.+ Gore and special effects were noteworthy.Cons- Story was rather transparent and not very believable.  Would they really let a population of 15,000 people settle in a recently infected but purged London?  They mentioned several times all other areas of the city were not safe.- Jerky and grainy camera work.  Whether it was intentional or not it definitely is not for someone who would suffer from motion sickness.- The ease of which the children escaped the military compound and get into the infected part of the city was laughable.- The father (a janitor) who had an all access pass to the entire facility presses a lockdown button to prove a point to his kids without any reprecussions?-  The infected but immune mother (who unbelievably survived) was left unguarded!  She possibly held the cure for the ""rage"" infection in her blood but she's left alone for the husband to find her and become reinfected, destroying the whole compound.- The lone helicopter pilot was allowed to fly unchecked the entire film, even when military jets are firebombing the compound to destroy the infected.- An infected father who even though he was infected by the ""rage"" was able to avoid being killed, firebombed and track his children to a subway station outside of the compound.Despite all of the cons listed above I still really enjoyed the movie for the sheer tension the movie seemed to instill.

412825,"&quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; is, I'd have to say, the most under-rated of the Halloween films.  It gets it's bad reputation because it's the only film in the series that does not feature Michael Myers prominently (he is actually seen in the movie during a scene at a bar when a commercial for a broadcast of the original film comes on a T.V.).Basically, this one centers around a mysterious Halloween mask production company's plot to kill all the children in the United States by planting small metallic devices inside the rubber masks that, when worn by the children during a special T.V. broadcast on Halloween night, will cause them to die a rather gruesome death via the excretion of snakes and other creepy crawlies from inside their bodies.  It's up to a man and his female partner to unlock the company's sinister secrets and bring it their evil plans to a halt before it's too late.I know, sounds a little off-beat, but who cares.  For anyone who is willing to look past the absence of Michael Myers and appreciate this film for what it is, I highly recommend you watch this one.  It's not on T.V. that often, so you'll probably have to either rent it or buy it.If you're a die-hard fan of the series and don't have this in your video collection yet, I would encourage you to purchase it.  However, if you're only a moderate fan I'd say rent it first.Even if you're not a fan of the series but like horror/sci-fi films (this one has a little bit from both genres) in general, I definitely encourage you to give this one a shot.P.S. For those who still continue to wonder why Carpenter went this route for the third installment, the answer is simple.  When &quot;Halloween II&quot; came out critics constantly bashed the film by saying that it was too much like the first one.  Listening to the critics, John and the rest of the people behind &quot;III&quot; decided to make it a completely different film.

1157918,"A few years ago, I saw a movie called ""Hulk"". You probably remember this movie, even if you don't particularly want to.  It was Ang Lee's unbelievably awful attempt at a superhero movie, and chief among its many faults was the excruciating overuse of split screens.  Having been subjected to that abomination of a film, I have now reached the point where the very sight of a split screen is enough to make me feel as though I'm about to turn into the hulk myself.  I mean, it really just makes my blood boil, honestly.So, this is where Bruce McDonald's latest film, ""The Tracey Fragments"", comes in.  This is a movie that rivals and maybe even surpasses ""Hulk"" in the blatant overuse of this oh-so-dreaded effect.  However, I can at least see here that it was done with the intent of symbolizing the sort of stream of consciousness nature of the story and its main character, Tracey.  Still, regardless of whatever it's supposed to represent, or whatever artistic merit it may or may not have, it largely serves no purpose other than to be really distracting and really annoying.  Little tip for would-be filmmakers regarding split screens: Less is more, and none is even better.Fortunately, this movie does have a few redeeming qualities.  Obviously it doesn't need to be said again that Ellen Page is amazing, but well, I guess I did anyway.  She is fantastic as Tracey, a somewhat disturbed young girl from an extremely dysfunctional family who ends up on a surreal journey through the streets to find her younger brother, who has run away from home.  Her performance is perfectly gritty and intense, tempered with just the right amount of dark humor.  On its own, the story is compelling (albeit bizarre, and not without its flaws), but I think it's her stellar acting that (almost) saves this mess of a movie.  She always manages to bring so many different dimensions to every character, and here is no exception.Still, the story is not without its flaws.  It skips around chronologically, which isn't too much of a problem most of the time, although it does get rather disorienting more often than not.  The whole thing plays out like a mix between a weird dream and a bad acid trip, and it never really reaches any sort of satisfactory resolution.  In the end, the viewer is left with more questions than answers, and at a mere 77 minutes of runtime, it just feels like it was thrown together in a hurry.  Still, it does definitely have its moments, and it benefits from an excellent score by Broken Social Scene.But yeah, those damn split screens!  I don't know, it's a personal thing, I guess.  Ang Lee beat this effect into my brain until I really just wanted to ""Crouching Tiger"" kick him right in the face.  I for one hope this isn't going to be in a continuing trend in films.  They call it the ""comic book effect"", or whatever, but if you ask me, I think if you want the experience of reading a comic book, you should READ A COMIC BOOK!!!  Anyway, sorry for the rant, but if you can get around the overkill of this, you might find some enjoyment here.  It's a decent effort, despite its many flaws.",The Tracey Fragments
799040,"Critics, in general, maligned this movie - perhaps unfairly.  The trouble is, it had SO MUCH to live up to.  How could it fail to disappoint?It's true that this is my least favorite of the Matrix movies.  When I re-watched the film, I tried to ascertain the meaning of this.  I think it is because it gives us the least of what we enjoyed about The Matrix in the first place.  The Matrix succeeds in the unlikely task of making a sci-fi, kung fu action flick out of Cartesian philosophy.  The first movie was about ideas and it also had a completely unique look to it.  The second movie got bogged down a bit with its ideas and made them seem a bit like mumbo-jumbo.  However, the second film had terrific fight scenes and a great highway chase.The problem about The Matrix: Revolutions is that, not only is it not about ideas - we hardly spend any time in The Matrix.  The big set-piece in this movie is the fight between the Squids and the defenders of Zion.  I wasn't too interested in that.  For one thing, there were so many Squids, I couldn't believe that the humans wouldn't be overwhelmed or retreat immediately.After Trinity rescues Neo at the beginning, we don't go back to The Matrix until the end.  That means no kung fu fighting and - even worse - no Agent Smith!  Agent Smith is the most fun character in these movies and under using him here is a critical flaw.  The best part of the film is the final confrontation between Smith and Neo.The Matrix Revolutions is still a good movie and worth owning.  The Matrix phenomenon has taken on a life of its own and the three movies fit well together as a set.  However, unlike Star Wars, The Matrix starts out strong but progressively declines.",N/A

And appropriately, the movie does have a lighthearted and comedic tone that is moderately entertaining, with a crazy monster and some messy kills.This Sy Fy original movie, this is your standard escaped creature tale.  Blue Water Corporation has been paid by the US Navy, to genetically engineer a creature known as S-11 designed to be used as a weapon.  Dr. Nathan Sand (Eric Roberts) and his daughter Nicole (Sara Malakul Lane) created S-11, and were able to track and control it, until it escaped in a training accident.  Now the beast is loose in the waters around Puerto Vallarta, feeding on the occasional beachgoer.The Sands hire ex-Blue Water employee Andy Flynn (Kerem Bursin), to help them recover the creature, and he heads out to sea in a small boat, while Nicole attempts to track its location on her laptop.  The monster then goes on a spectacular killing spree, showing up everywhere to grab a bite to eat.  The beast even leaves the ocean to make an appearance at show for the touristas, chomping up a couple of dancers before returning to the sea.  Flynn and Nicole eventually hook up with TV reporter Stacy Everheart (Liv Boughn), and Bones (Hector Jimenez) her cameraman, as they make a last desperate bid to destroy S-11 at a water park.Directed by Declan O'Brien (Wrong Turn 3), Sharktopus features some cool topical locations, and colorful scenery, it's fun predictable trash where you can see the kills coming, and almost all the characters do become monster snacks.  The acting is often pretentiously bad, but then it's supposed to be, and even features a cameo by producer Roger Corman as a beachcomber.  Blake Lindsey is pretty amusing as fisherman Pez Kingsbury.The special effects are slightly better than what you see in your typical Sy Fy feature, and actually shine at some moments.  The Sharktopus is pretty weird looking, and is most impressive out of the water perched on its legs.  The monster seems to vary in size, and by the end has become quite massive and highly aggressive.  Since it often appears on the Sy Fy Channel, you might want to catch it there before you buy.

168375,"Despite the unoriginal premise (the movie Big recast with a woman), 13 Going on 30 is a very entertaining movie and this is due in large part to its star, Jennifer Garner, who brings to her role loads of charm. This movie is the perfect vehicle for the actress because it allows her to break away from the action hero persona that she cultivated with the T.V. show Alias and Daredevil and prove that she can do a romantic comedy.Garner, with her warm, disarming smile has a wholesome, girl-next-door quality that is quite endearing. She's beautiful but not in an unattainable way. She also has natural comedic ability, for example, in one scene, Jenna livens up her magazine's boring party with an impromptu dance to Michael Jackson's ""Thriller,"" inspiring others to get up and dance as well. Garner also has a very expressive face that is perfect for the broad comedy of this movie. She is willing to take risks and make fun of herself. She is also willing to put herself out there and is not afraid to appear goofy and this only makes her that much more appealing.13 Going On 30 is the victim of the dreaded double dip. If you already own the Special Edition version of the movie, the two new extras hardly warrant a re-purchase. Also, if you already own the previous edition you might want to hold onto it as the audio commentary by director Gary Winick and the commentary by producers Gina Matthews, Donna Arkoff-Roth, and Susan Arnold is not on this edition.New to this edition is ""Fashion Flashback: Into the 1980s"" that features teen models gushing about how much they love the ""retro"" look of the `80s.

The scene is about the same length as what is in the movie but is edited differently. We get more detail on Jenna's desire to be one of the popular girls.

(For example, he tries oysters on a half shell at a fancy restaurant and pretends to eat them/like them for the snooty waiter. When no one's looking, he dumps the slimy stuff in a lady's purse without her knowing. When her phone, inside her purse, eventually rings--he panics.)Some parts are a bit slow, but if you hang to the end, you'll find a surprisingly tight plot. I love how they tied it all together at the end (and Willem Dafoe was a marvelous sport!)However, there was some cussing in the DVD, as well as scenes of faux war--including guns blazing. I'm not a prude--don't mind violence and language normally. HOWEVER, this movie is supposedly rated G, and so I figured there wouldn't be ANYTHING remotely objectionable about this movie...so I let my 9 year old son watch it. I didn't appreciate that those elements were in the movie; it should have been PG.If you're a fan of visual comedy and the simpleminded wonderment of Mr. Bean, you'll likely enjoy this holiday movie.

Jem was like Rock Star Barbie, and the episodes for this series generally revolved around concerts, fashion, making music videos and hot sports cars, and of course the Vixen crossed with Taylor Dayne, dance inducing electric edged pop rock music that went along with it.She-Ra provided little girls of the 80s with a strong female heroine to look up to for their fantasy otherworldly fix, while JEM provided the &quot;I wanna be a rock star&quot; fantasy rolled up into made for tv animation.

537020,"What PEARL HARBOR strives to be is the ""Titanic"" it never was. Sure, it's a blockbuster, but the movie is far from getting a Best Picture Oscar nomination, except probably for the special effects and sound effects.PEARL HARBOR is counting the days until and after the Day of Infamy, December 7, 1941, all the while spinning a somewhat uneven romantic triangle between Kate Beckinsale, Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck. Affleck and Harnett are top-notch pilots, while Beckinsale is an adorable nurse whom they both love.PEARL HARBOR is a uneven movie that tries to be the ""Titanic"" of 2001, and turns out to be a pale imitation. Sure, it's not good, but it's far from being a expensive piece of eye candy. What we get from the movie is countless cameos from Cuba Gooding Jr. and dozens more; an uneven romantic subplot with the most awful romantic dialogue there is; a frightening, realistic 30 minutes as the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor; and a sad ending.I prefer TITANIC over PEARL HARBOR because the story focuses more on the characters and events surrounding them, whilst PEARL HARBOR unevenly paces the many subplots it's sagging with, no tension as the battle rages on and off the battlefield, and all of the characters aren't fully fleshed out.If you're looking for a good tear-jerker, this isn't your flick.

1108085,"For those who do not have the dvd and only seen this on Showtime, I can clear up some of your complaints about this episode.In the director/writer commentary, a major story issue was revealed. When this story was being developed the two teens (nowhere in this episode was it stated that they were in college) were originally young boys between the ages 8-13. That was changed due to how much work and overtime this episoe required and child labor laws would have made that impossible to do with kids.This was suppose to be a story about two boys that were pretty much geeks (or in Arjay Smith's character, Kerry, case a white geek dipped in chocolate). To a certain point that worked and didn't work. It took liberty with some of the things vampires do and rewrote the one thing they did-bite people. Instead they just rip necks and leave a open gap that doesn't heal or keep water down.It should have focused more on Kerry since it was implied that he came from a worst home life than Justin. While Kerry was forced to accept becoming a vampire, Justin fought it to the very end. Ironside was the comic relief and the ""father"" figure that both boys lacked.The ending flat out screams a sequel or a crossover with Angel, Buffy, Blade the Vampire Hunter, Morbius or Dracula.",N/A

1383177,"I've liked all of Korine's previous films, so I was looking forward to his fourth feature.  I've concluded that if you're fond of Korine's work, you'll be more inclined to watch and admire this film.  It was shot and edited on VHS equipment, and it's funny at times to see the ""auto tracking"" message and the accompanying video noise.  But the film would have worked just as well on digital video (which is what Korine used in julien donkey-boy), so the VHS is ultimately a gimmick.  The concept of the film (Korine said that the film is supposed to ""be"" like a lost VHS tape that has been discovered, and it has all this strange, random, unexplainable footage on it) is actually more intriguing than the actual film itself.  In that respect, it's similar to some of Andy Warhol's work, like Sleep and Empire, except not as long as those 2 films.  Trash Humpers is a mere 78 minutes compared to the multi-hour endurance tests of Empire and Sleep.I think that Korine was just trying to shock all of us, but I wasn't really shocked by this film.  Having seen Gummo, julien donkey-boy, and Mister Lonely, I am immune by Korine's shock tactics.  I found Trash Humpers funny and kind of sad in a way.  If Korine was trying to go ""punk"" and shock us, it doesn't work.  As a strange, surreal film, Trash Humpers works well at times.  The main characters have ugly, deranged looking old people's masks on, and they look like Grandpa from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.There are 2 shorts on the DVD.  Blood in Havana is good (showing one of the Trash Humper characters wandering around Havana, Cuba), but Mac and Plac is way overlong at 27 minutes.  It's essentially a short film of 2 characters in Trash Humpers who play ""cojoned"" twins, and the film seems to consist of outtakes from the film itself, as some of the material in the short is also in the main feature.  Some of it is OK, but Korine put the best parts of the scene in the main movie itself, so it just comes across as a waste of time and not a seperate film at all.Trash Humpers isn't bad for what it is, but I'm glad I didn't pay 12 dollars to see it in a theater.  After the maturity Korine showed in his previous movie Mister Lonely, I wonder why he felt he had to go ""punk"" in his fourth feature.  I'll have to ask him that one day.",N/A
1057011,"The 165 one-hour episodes (45 in B&W;, 120 in color) of the frontier western ""Daniel Boone"" originally aired on NBC from 1964-1970. So this DVD set is the third of six seasons for this extremely popular baby boomer show.  The show itself may seem a little odd today due to an uncharacteristic emphasis on racial/ethnic diversity (insert Ed Ames as Mingo and NFL lineman Rosey Grier as Gabe Cooper). But the times were a-changing as the country tried to turn itself into LBJ's ""Great Society"" and network executives smelled an opportunity to cash in on the baby boomer's budding social awareness.The series moved between a domestic focus on Boone's family (Patricia Blair as wife Rebecca, Veronica Cartwright as daughter Jemima, and Darby Hinton as his son Israel) to ""one-with-the-wilderness""/""the British are evil"" themes. The series focused on Boone after he had moved to Kentucky.Daniel was played by Fess Parker who already had an established coonskin cap franchise from his mid-1950's Disney TV portrayal of Davy Crockett. Boone is played as an even tempered peaceful man who likes to chum around in the woods with Oxford educated Indians and runaway black slaves (see above), your basic 1770's flower child. Other than his confrontations with ""the man"" (represented by those nasty Redcoats) there is very little messy violence and lots of ""Little House on the Prairie"" moments.Cartwright, the most talented of the ensemble, is frustratingly underutilized. Particularly given that the most celebrated event in the real Daniel Boone's life was the rescue of his daughter and her two friends from Indian kidnappers.Cartwright bailed out after season two and was replaced by budding sausage king Jimmy Dean as Josh Clements, in the tradition Chester and Festus from ""Gunsmoke"".Then again, what do I know?

271886,"The Amazon review mentions 1930s gangster films and I can see some relation to that.  It's got the pathos and certain 'lack of reality' about it that old time gangster movies seemed to have more of than some of the better modern classics like Good Fellas or Scarface.  So if you're in the mood for that and you have some reference or appreciation for that kind of movie in the first place, this might be more enjoyable.  Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough but I'd still take Carlito's Way, Casino or any of the other modern classics in terms of a more meaty and believable story line.  Guess I'm still a sucker for realism.  It's not to say the movie was bad, just not quite 5 star in terms of entertainment value and involving plot.  I do like to watch C. Walken in action though, and his performance as well as some of the other bad guys (notably Lawrence Fishburn in an early role) was pretty good.  The cops were a bit over the top, but again this may be part of the ""Bogart"" tradition the movie was aspiring for.  Just not sure how well it translated to modern New York (or at least 1990 New York).  In spite of the movie's release date being 1990, it's still got an 80s vibe about it (hairstyles and music) though you can feel the dawn of the 90s as well.  The ending is almost noirish, which compared to the predictable alternative, was a good thing.On a 5-star scale, and in terms of what I like in modern gangster movies, I'd give the plot 3 stars, acting 4 stars, atmosphere/cinematography 4.5 stars.  I felt the movie would have been better with if the plot had been allowed to thicken a bit and characters had developed a bit more.  It seemed to be going somewhere in the beginning but around 2/3 of the way through it turned into a big shooting spree with the cops disregarding all police procedure in their quest to snuff out the king.

Sandra Bullock has played this type of part (the workaholic, all-consuming business professional) dozens of times before, and Ryan Reynolds has ten stages of annoying (in this role he is at stage six; no, make that seven); yet the premise is cute enough:  Bullock's character is in danger of being deported back to Canada, so to avoid this little dilemma she strong-arms her apprehensive assistant (Reynolds) into a faux engagement.  And to further dig themselves into a hole before a suspicious federal agent (Denis O'Hare), the would-be couple announces they will be heading for the weekend to introduce the would-be bride to the would-be groom's real life family--in Alaska (more on that later).  Once the story shifts there, the deception is further layered, before it unravels--yet (who would've thunk!) both protagonists suddenly realize they are hopelessly in luv.It's cute (like I said), and there are some giggle moments, and the venerable Betty White is constantly rushed in to say the choice one-liners (playing Reynolds' grandma), yet there's nothing here to offer a new twist or unique plot shift to keep THE PROPOSAL from rushing headlong towards its predictable ending.

The plot is a bit contrived (but aren't all Bond films)with a villan that isn't as threatening as others because he doesn't do much in the way of his own dirty deeds. Still, it's an interesting comment on the globalization of the media when the bad guy can be a Rupert Murdoch type zillonaire.Tomorrow works best when Brosnan and co-star Michelle Yeoh are on screen together. While they don't always boast the best chemistry, their stunt and action sequences together are quite dazzling. Bond fits Brosnan like a well tailored suit in his second appearence. He inhabits the role and makes it his own. There isn't quite as much depth or angst evident in the bulk of the film to compare to meeting his ex-lover (Terri Hatcher), his discovery of her fate and his own execution of ""The Doctor"".The commentary by director Roger Spottiswoode wasn't half as interesting to me as that provided by the second unit crew. Spottiswoode shows that he does have a knack for action films which is surprising given his background as a director of character driven films. That background, though, comes to the fore during several important scenes and his ease with the actors is evident by the performances turned in by Jonathan Pryce.The stunts are dazzling particularly the impossible one pulled off when Yeoh and Bronsnan must leap from the top of a skyscraper. Their ingenius (and highly unlikely) solution to escape works due to deft editing and photography.

1247302,"Its something of a mystery as to why anyone would want to remake the original George Romero film The Crazies. It was a very forgettable film, but the premise was a good idea. In the case of this remake Breck Eisner managed to improve upon the story and make it worth seeing. I found the film to echo numerous similar stories, and there really isnt anything new that comes to play here. Added to that are the usual familiar formulas with less than plausable sequences that expect the audience to be a little gullible and to suspend a great deal of reality in the process. Some of the subject matter is too far fetched to ever expect it to be anywhere near believable if something like this were to ever happen in real life. None the less there are some genuinly freightening moments through out that work well even if they may seem to feel rather familiar. I also noticed there was a good job with the sound on this film. The work the sound crew did on this is worth taking notice of. I rarely take note of sound achievements in film unless its one of the obvious classics that won an oscar and is remembered for its over all sound quality. This one had me examining the sound a little closer and I couldnt help noticing the work done here where the sound is concerned was above average and worth recognizing. The film is not really awesome, but far from terrible. Its sort of a blend of The hills have eyes and a decent zombie movie, never getting as good as either, but still fairly entertaining.

Some readers commented that it's not 100% accurate, well, to have the book been converted into a movie is by no mean an easy feat.  The stars of the show would definitely be those adorable children.  Special effects in this instance is second rank with some really shoddy resolution.  Then, there's the deja-vu with Lords of the Ring Trilogy and I can't blame them when you could see towards the end credits that costumes and weapons are derived from WETA (special effects wing of Peter Jackson's production company).  I think that a movie shall be enjoyed for what it is rather than this discussion about the Christianity element in it.  If that's the case, what's so wrong about it when Christianity is to preach people to do the moral things?  Ultimately, this movie is about the magic that we possessed when we were young and then, we lose it when we get older.  It's all about faith and hope in believing in the little children that is in all of us.  By the way, Tilda Swinton is absolutely superb and Liam Neeson's majestic voice is superb.

And that makes me wonder, what was the point of making a movie if only fans of the series could truly appreciate it?  Why didn't they just make a two hour t.v. movie?  Obviously, they were hoping to expand their market with this big screen version, but as box office receipts proved, the film did not make the beaucoups of money the producers had hoped to.  Nor did it make movie stars out of David Duchovny or Gillian Anderson.  I will admit however that the movie is not the least bit boring, just confusing.  The performances are professional and noteworthy, the music is neat, and it moves at a very intense pace.  However, for the simple movie goer and those who did not follow the series after this movie was released, it left a lot of open territory to explore.  A well made, interesting movie, but not enough to make me run out and buy the DVDs of the series.",N/A
1109347,"I think this miniseries was very informative.  It shows in great detail what life was like around the time of the Revolutionary War, and also shows many behind the scenes details that aren't well known.  Namely, the role John Adams played in the formation of the country.However, that being said, John Adams is insufferable and generally miserable and angry.  So although this miniseries was well done, I find it's not the kind of thing I want to watch over and over again.  But, I think it's one of those things most people need to see at least once in their lives.",John Adams
753727,"James Franco delivers another intense, emotional performance in Nicholas Cage's directorial debut Sonny, about a young man who is forced to choose between hustling and living a normal life. The story is intriguing, but never fully developed, and the directing is choppy which makes for difficult viewing. The acting is ok from most of the actors. Besides from James Franco, Mena Suvari finally gives a performance that is worth mentioning. Brenda Bleythyn is over the top, annoying, and loud, and the accent-obnoxious. She usually gives amazing performances, but this time, she missed, and Nic Cage comes in at the end with a rediculous cameo. The films pace is a little slow, but it did keep my interest. See this film for James Franco and Mena Suvari, other than that..I would advise staying away.",Sonny

When they are found they are returned to his brother and his new wife. The new parents discover that the kids are not normal and strange things begin to happen around the house. There really isn't too much I can say about this movie. I will say that it was much better then I expected, but I also expected it to be very awful. I thought the first movie in the series was funny. I didn't like the second one (because of the tin arm guy). The third one was OK and I really don't remember the fourth one but I know I saw it. I was even more leery about this one because Anna Faris isn't in it. I will admit that I laughed out loud a few times throughout but like most spoof movies it starts out funny then by the end you are just waiting for it to be over. I did expect much worse though. Overall, better then I expected and it did make me laugh. I give it a B-.",Scary Movie 5

215164,"I first saw ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" in 1991, and I've LOVED it ever since.  I was so thrilled to see that Paramount was giving this classic film an upgraded DVD Special Edition.  Upon seeing it however, I must say that I'm pretty disappointed.  The extras, although enjoyable, are sorely lacking what they could and SHOULD be.  Most of the film's major stars (and sometimes even minor ones like Kristy Swanson and Richard Edson) provide some updated interviews that are fun to watch.  But, the bonus material and interviews featuring Mia Sara are all from 1986!  She obviously CAN'T be that busy these days, so doesn't it make sense that an updated interview with her could have been included?Also, the shooting script for this movie contains MANY deleted scenes and dialogue, some of which were a GREAT read and are bound to have been filmed.  Ferris going through the house looking for money in some STRANGE places (all while the Pink Floyd tune ""Money"" was playing), as well as Cameron's dad seeing his 1961 Ferarri being driven through Chicago's streets by the two parking garage employees would have been GREAT to see.  However, the ONLY deleted scene we get here is a behind-the-scenes version of the waiter at Chez Qui telling the trio that the food they were eating was pancreas (which of course was referred to later by Ferris in the taxi).  No true special edition DVD should be without a deleted scenes section.  VERY disappointing.Next, this edition (like the original) does NOT include a theatrical trailer.  It's rare for even a bare bones DVD not to include at least one trailer, but nearly UNHEARD of for a special edition!  It's bound to still exist, and I can't beleive that it's THAT hard to find that they could not have dug it up for this ""special"" edition.Finally, the original DVD, while lacking a trailer, DID include a GREAT feature-length commentary track by writer/director John Hughes.  However, that commentary track is NOT included here!  That was either a severe oversight or a downright mean move by Paramount.  How hard would it have been to reproduce it here?  In effect, its omission forces anyone who bought the original DVD and wants to upgrade to the special edition to keep the original instead of selling or trading it, all because they want to retain the commentary.  Paramount should have at least made it possible that owning this new DVD would provide the most complete ""Ferris"" experience presently possible by itself, but without the original's commentary it doesn't.In summary, if you bought the original DVD, then I advise you to keep it and just rent this new version to give the special features a look.  Save the rest of what you would otherwise spend on this to put towards something more worthwhile.  If you have NOT bought the original DVD however, then this would be a worthwhile purchase to own the extras that were not present on the original.  But, do rent the original to give a listen to that AWESOME commentary track by John Hughes.",N/A
968962,"Hyped as the first co-production of Bryan Singer (Director of X-Men) and Dean Devlin (producer and writer of Independence Day) this should be a sci-fi spectacular. Alas, while a satisfying enough diversion for a while, it does not tread any new ground, ideas, or benchmarks in sci-fi.The story revolves more around technobabble than character development, despite some fine acting from almost all involved. Sam Neill is a multi-millionaire shipping magnate who offers a huge sum to a disparate group of experts to solve the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle. As time goes by, it becomes clearer that his motivation is more personal than he at first admits, and that there is a time constraint, as things head from mystery to countdown to disaster.An interesting subplot revolves around the excellent Lou Diamond Phillips, who is one of the victims, experiencing alternate realities as a result of his encounter with the Triangle. Did I say alternate realities..? Yes, you'll have to get used to listening to theories on `exotic matter', `parallel universes', `ripples in space time', `government conspiracies' and `electromagnetic disturbances'.. however the end does tie things together - with the help of a substantial dose of belief suspension. In fact, the ending is just a little too neat and ideal to be truly satisfying. That said, there are plenty of interesting ideas here to keep this fresh enough to be worth viewing.The effects are just up to small screen standard, but never believable enough to make you forget they are special effects. However the acting is, for the most part, excellent, and it is this, particularly from Phillips and from Eric Stolz, that help us suspend belief to make this mini series work.Over the disc we get the three episodes, each just under 1  hours, plus some interview snippets with the principals and a making of documentary.Overall, at the price offered by Amazon, well worth a buy, as long as you do not keep too high expectations. Fine acting, good pitch of an idea, but not so impressive in execution of story.","Triangle, The"
116137,"It always seems as though the same concept gets sold to a variety of Hollywood producers at about the same time &amp; a race is on to get out a product.  Last year two big rocks came to hit the Earth in two different  movies, for example.  The current big trend is Cyber-Space or alternate  reality.Three movies have been released at almost the same time about  this theme: The Thirteenth Floor, eXisTenz, and The Matrix.Matrix is,  admittedly, a lot of fun, even if it lacks the maturity of eXisTenz or the  more pure Sci/Fi attitude of Thirteenth Floor.  Matrix plays more towards  an action/adventure crowd and makes frequent use of the same type of  special effects as can be seen in those pants commercials where the kids  are dancing, then seem to freeze in mid-air.  Kind of neat, but we've seen  it before, and soon it will go the way of &quot;Morphing&quot; which T2  brought to a whole new level but isn't used too often anymore because of  the been-there, done-that attitude.Also, Keanu Reeves' final showdown  with the Computer Agent felt contrived.  He had a phone to catch, after  all, and the fight with these bad guys could have waited until the  sequel.Many have commented on the &quot;what-if&quot; our life is just a  computer program.  Kind of like what if our life is just a dream of the  fantasy and science fiction novels of not so long ago.  It isn't new, and  Matrix, rather than try to make the idea new, turns it into the starting  point for a story of a comic book hero.Most disturbing about this movie  is the scene where the heroes walk into the lobby of an office building and  shoot all of the guards.  This was overly reminiscent of the man who walked  into the lobby of the Capitol and opened fire.  I found the scene difficult  to applaud.  This is in contrast with a scene in T2 where Arnold, after  being told not to kill anyone, takes careful aim and shoots out tires and  lights rather than people.  The scene in Matrix might have played better if  the heroes were given more fanciful weapons.  Luke Skywalker had his  lightsaber, Indiana Jones had a whip.  These were pretty cool toys.  Keanu  Reeves, in the computer generated world, should have been able to come up  with something similarly fantastic.",N/A
836785,"""Decoys"" is a little flick from our neighbors to the north.  It features a cast built up primarily of newcomers(at least to the U.S. audience)and some reasonably good special effects considering the budget.The story centers around St. John's College(filmed at University of Ottawa) where a good chunk of the male population has started to come up missing or frozen from the inside out.  No one knows what's happening to these guys until one curious male student stumbles upon a pair of sorority sister cousins with some interesting appendages.  They lack belly buttons but have another surprise waiting for the boys in their unusual birthmarks.  The story unfolds from there as the student, Luke Callahan, attempts to uncover the girls for what they really are and to find out why they are freezing any and every amorous boy that they can get their hands on.  Of course, our hero becomes a suspect in the case, lead by an eager Canadian cop played by the recognizable Richard Burgi and his sidekick, the lovely but never quite a star, Nicole Eggert.As stated before, the majority of this cast is comprised of newcomers excepting Burgi and Eggert.  Also, look out for the guy who plays ""Jay"" on ""Degrassi:  The Next Generation.""  Another little surprise was the coroner, played with tongue-firmly-in-cheek by veteran soap star Don Hastings.The FX are pretty good.  The creatures look good in close-ups, but you can tell when a CGI model is used pretty easily.The story isn't too terrible, but allow for the below-average acting and the sometimes hokey direction.  It's obvious that the director was trying to keep things reasonably light, as attested to in the ""Making Of"" documentary included on the DVD.  In other words, it seems like the cast and crew knew that this flick wasn't going to be a contender in the awards department, so they had fun making it.There is some nudity and a lot of sensuality, usually followed by some swift violence.  The language isn't too horrible.  As a matter of fact, if you cut out the few scenes with nudity, this film probably would have registered a PG-13 rating in the U.S.Recommended to fans of B-grade horror who know what they are getting into.",N/A
189849,"Having been sealed for centuries, an evil leprechaun is unleashed. Setting a foot a campaign to regain all his 'lucky gold coins'. Easier said then done, his gold coins have been scattered a bit. In an act of revenge and remaining dormant for years this creepy little bugger is out to (oh my) kill!Scare factors are low, but the eeriness lingers. Leprechaun makes for one scary looking slasher on the loose. Jennifer Aniston snagged a lead role in the film, only to have this be one of her more forgotten roles (typecast Friends anyone?!). The setting is a 'middle of nowhere' location, we've all been their. Creepy looking house in 'the middle of nowhere', with little to do and land that just grapples the surroundings.One of the worst places to be with a killer on the prowl. The movie follows the slasher guidelines relatively well as it maintains the 'final  girl'. The film depicts a father with two kids, a worker interested in the fathers daughter, and an autistic fellow who's child like nature causes more trouble then his innocence would seem to carry.Overall what else can be said about the film? Not the greatest scare, a bit slow paced, the quality is a tad low, but it's still a cult classic. Leprechaun is a decent flick, I recommend finding it on your television or maybe a rental. If you are going to watch a slasher of a midget with light supernatural consistencies, I highly recommend the first two ""Child's Play"".",Leprechaun

It's just not half as interesting when you already know exactly what's gonna happen and that cost a couple of points alone.I rate movies with certain point scale and being a movie where re-watching it is maybe a third as entertaining as the initial viewing takes away any buying potential period.Now, I'm not saying this applies to all movies with a great twist but generally if you know Bruce is dead in the Sixth Sense there is virtually no rason to watch the movie hoping to be entertained in a major way.Ditto with Cabins in the Woods.It is awesome that they even tried something like this and it's a twist that more or less can't be guessed as it's so far off the ususal horror crap however try watching it again and try to pretend it was even half as good as the first time you watch it...I dare you.Walking out of the movies I was pretty sure I would buy this when it came out...after watching again I think I can do without.However I would agree you need to watch this at least once.PSIf your like me you'll probably find yourself pausing at a few scenes near the end just to catch all the bloody action on the screen.

Fortunately, my fianc&eacute;e had seen Ghost in the Shell before and was able to explain it to me.The animation of Ghost in the Shell is fantastic. In a few places the scenery looks more like it has been filmed rather than drawn, and even the characters have movements that are fluid and graceful, instead of jerky and robotic, like some animated movies can have.The storyline of Ghost in the Shell is pretty straightforward, although the last 15 minutes or so was quite a surprise.  There's a lot of philosophy involved in the movie, mostly about what makes a person truly human, is it the ghost (a soul), or is it the fact we feel human.Ghost in the Shell was well done, and even though I'm not a huge fan of anime I enjoyed it quite a bit.",N/A

We do see that Mr. Fisher does find and confront his birth mother, but it would have been nice to hear her side of the story in the movie instead of just hearing Antwone tell her all about how well he has turned out as a man.Also, does Antowne Fisher end up marrying, Cheryl, his girlfriend in the movie and do they have a happily ever after?

1576479,"When the original movie COMA was released to theaters an entire generation was put into a state of panic when it came to undergoing simple surgery. The idea of surgery is scary enough but to consider the thought that someone at the hospital would put you into a coma on purpose so they could harvest your organs for the highest bidder? My guess is the number of people who signed on to ""organ donor"" cards that year plummeted. Believe it or not that was 34 years ago and it seems that there is a new generation who has no idea what the story of COMA is. That is until they watch this new mini-series just released on DVD.The story revolves around a med student studying to become a surgeon by the name of Susan Wheeler (Lauren Ambrose). It helps that her family helped establish the hospital she's doing her residency in, but Susan has to pull her own weight as well. Just having a name won't get you past doctors trying to push you to the limit.Things get a little odd when a friend of Susan's in for a routine operation suddenly crashes on the operating table and goes into a coma. No one can explain why this happened and she is eventually sent to a long term care facility called The Jefferson Institute. But this doesn't comfort Susan much. She continues to search for a reason for her friend's sudden comatose state, a search that eventually causes two different people who provide her with information to lose their jobs.Running parallel to this story is a bright young surgeon who is Susan's instructor as well, Dr. Mark Bellows (Steven Pasquale). Bellows is having an affair with a psychologist and hospital head, Dr. Lindquest (Geena Davis). As he instructs Susan and eventually joins her crusade to find out what's going on, Lindquest becomes jealous and threatens his position. It's not enough to stop him or Susan from digging deeper.As Susan checks the records she discovers that there has been an abnormal amount of comas at her hospital, enough that one would think and investigation would have begun. But doctors and the heads of the hospital circle the wagons and not only prevent an investigation but threaten to expel Susan as well. To her rescue comes the star doctor of the hospital and their biggest money maker when it comes to fundraising, Dr. Stark (James Woods). When Stark takes gets involved with Susan's investigation things take a turn for the worse. Sorry, no spoiler here I won't reveal anything involving Stark.The more Susan digs into the reason for the comas and their connection to The Jefferson Institute, the darker things become. Just who is involved and how far up the chain of command this conspiracy goes is anyone's guess and as viewers we find ourselves with plenty of possible bad guys to choose from. From Susan's point of view there is almost no one she can trust and even those she does she has to wonder about. When an attempt is made on her life rather than give up she continues searching for answers.If you've seen the original then you already know what is going on behind the scenes. If you haven't then you'll probably not want to watch this before scheduling surgery any time soon. The story itself is a tight thriller that keeps you guessing until the end.That being said it worked better the first time around. Contained in a film just under 2 hours it works better and doesn't overload you with far too much information or quantity of possible suspects. As a four hour mini-series it takes us places that don't matter that just seem to fill time and cause you to forget who is who and just why they're important to the story. The pacing isn't near as frantic and the thrill aspect of the story doesn't really kick in until the last 20 minutes of more. The original kept a pace going from half way through until the very end of the film.This is not to say that this version is terrible. It's just, well, different. That's one of the problems with remakes; those of us who remember the original find ourselves unconsciously comparing the two each and every minute of the film. If this is your first exposure to this story then you'll find plenty to hold your interest. If you recall the first version, this one holds up okay but you'll find it slower than that one. Either way, it makes for an interesting story and worth the price of a rental.",N/A

784040,"Robert (Nathan Fillion) and Molly Graves (Chandra West) are trying to keep it together after the death of their young daughter.  He is a writing who is now unable to write anything, and so the couple end up at his late father's cabin in the small rural community of Reedsville.  Molly is haunted by a terrible dream and is doing a bit more than contemplating suicide.  Finding that Molly has loaded his father's old shotgun, Robert takes the gun and run out of the hunting cabin into the woods.  This seemed like a good idea at the time, but in the woods he stumbles across a strange scene: A sheriff has dragged a handcuffed young woman out of his cop car in the middle of the forest and is about to kill her.  Robert intervenes, which means he and Molly are suddenly up to their necks in the cesspool of small town corruption.Robert has saved the life of Rae Baines (Emmanuelle Vaugier), and of course he wants to know why the sheriff was about to bash her head in with a rock.  An explanation is not forthcoming, and Robert's suspicions are aroused when he discovers $200,000 and some lewd photographs of Rae in the sheriff's car.  Clearly there is something rotten going on in Reedsville and since they are in the middle of nowhere, Robert has nobody he can trust.  This actually works out because apparently nobody in Reedsville is trustworthy, from Mayor Block (Daniel Baldwin) on down.  But Robert and Molly are in way over their heads.  At least their martial problems no longer seem that that important.Obviously the main attraction for this 2003 direct to DVD movie is Nathan Fillion, who has a legion of fans because of his starring role on Joss Whedon's ""Firefly,"" which translated into the theatrical film ""Serenity.""  But unless you harbor dreams that he is going to show up on your doorstep and propose to you out of a clear blue sky, this is clearly a rental.  Fillion and West both provide fine performances, but Vaugier cannot carry off the shifts required to keep stirring up the plot in this one.  Fortunately, the rest of the characters keep things fairly low-keyed, so things never descend into caricature, but the initial set up slowly descends into fairly standard action, including a gunfight where people are shooting in and out of a house without bothering to use the windows.  Except for a handful of trailers there are no special features on this DVD, which just reinforces that ""Water's Edge"" is essentially a curiosity for Fillion's fans.",Water's Edge

1025758,"I kind of enjoyed this movie, but it was very predictable.  It was far fetched.  The snakes looked rather fake and seemed more aggressive than one would ever believe, even hyped up with pheromones sprayed on flowers in the plane to excite the snakes.  I noticed one kid's review, but I wouldn't take any kids to see this movie.  Not only are there some very gory scenes; there is also a semi-nude scene.  Shortly into the movie a guy is clubbed to death with a baseball bat and while you don't see it happen, you do see the splatter of blood coming out and all over the assailant.  Some kids are fascinated with snakes and probably wanted to see this movie, but it is not appropriate for children in any way.  Samuel Jackson is his usual charming self and was fun to watch.  Too many things here don't add up in this movie and it really takes a stretch of imagination to believe it.  The movie is so far out it is almost laughable.  I can't quite figure out who this movie was made for.  They could have done a much better job on the movie, but went too much overboard on many things.  Stuff just doesn't happen this way.

So, I write this review with a heavy heart.Second, I was always looking for the Old School content on this DVD.  I would rather Elmo and the post-racial rainbow kids had never been invented.  Roosevelt Franklin, writers who met social, racial and class conditions head-on, the music of Joe Raposo--this is what I wanted.How disappointing.  There is a minimum of new material from the Old School DVD collections.  And Joe Raposo's name is not even prominent (is it even mentioned?) in the book that accompanies the DVDs.  I'll have to read it again, but Jon Stone is fronted and Raposo is definitely in the background.Anyway, I'll just have to keep hoping that the marketing gurus at Sesame Wallet Project see fit in the future to release our childhood memories more systematically and completely.

Predictable in spots, s-l-o-w direction, and a confusing script brings this film down to nothing special. Tom Hanks appears briefly in the film.

592256,"My kung fu favorites were always the classics, though I have always loved the cheesier ones -- the ones with the very bad dubbing, the ludicrous plots, and all the other cliches that came with the genre once it began to go downhill during the mid to late 1970s (with some obvious exceptions).  In particular, I've always loved the many many Wu Tang movies, many of which were completely insane but in a way that you grew to love.""Kung Pow - Enter the Fist"" is an obvious spoof of the worst of the genre, using - funnily enough - a rather serious and rather good movie, ""Tiger and Crane Fists aka Savage Killers"" - for inspiration and lifting entire scenes from that movie.  The director, writer, and star obviously knows the genre quite well and pokes fun at many of the things you would ordinarily find funny anyway while watching a typical, lesser grade wuxia film.If you know the genre, you might find this film quite clever.  Indeed, you will 'get' many of the jokes and genre nods.  However, I am not sure that the fact that you will 'get it' will make the film a winner for you.  It 'is' a clever film but it is hardly ever as funny as the real thing is.  Frankly, I would much rather watch one of the original films, badly dubbed, and laugh at that.  Which is, funnily enough, what I did once I got halfway through ""Kung Pow.""Again, that isn't to say that the film is bad -- it is funny in a very silly way, but it is hardly a winner.  There are some giggle moments but no laugh-out-loud moments for me.  Most of the humor comes from the concept itself, which gets old about 10 - 15 minutes in.  Yes, the originals were badly dubbed, the camera often panned funnily on the faces of the protagonists, the sound effects were ludicrous at times -- we get it.  But after about 10 minutes, it isn't really funny anymore and you find yourself wanting to see the originals and laugh at the often unintentionally funny segments of those movies.  Or watch ""Drunken Master,"" which has many of these conventions but is legitimately funny within the concept of the movie (and the English version 'is' badly dubbed).Could have been better.  As it is, a decent spoof.  If the wuxia classics ""The 36 Chambers of Shaolin"" or ""The One Armed Swordsman"" get 5 stars in my book, this one could never possibly get 5 or 4 stars.  And the originals, like any of the worst Wu Tang or fake Bruce Lee movies, would get a 3 or 2, then this one gets a 3.",Kung Pow! Enter the Fist
467711,"I, like so many other people who grew up in the time I did, was first attracted to this film solely through the title song by Dr. Dre on the soundtrack to the film.  It was ridiculous how much I heard that song get played all over the radio and the hype it surrounded the movie with during that spring of 1992.  In fact, it, in many ways, has outlasted the film itself in terms of pop culture's memory.  And that is actually a shame.This a superior thriller, taking the undercover cop story and crafting a tension-drenched and surprisingly subtle movie.  And though it begins to lose its bottom by the end and becomes a little contrived, for the first three quarters of the movie it is expertise and a whole lot more unpredictable than most films of its genre.  Veteran actor Laurence Fishburne stars, in, surprisingly, his first lead role, as an L.A. cop who is assigned to go undercover and infiltrate a major cocaine empire in Los Angeles.  It is a job he reluctantly takes; as a child he witnessed his junkie father killed while pulling a stickup on Christmas Eve.  The flashback of this is shown as the opening scene and is one of the most disturbing in the film, as the young child, who had just listened to his father ask him what he wanted for Christmas, watches the whole bloody incident in horror and pain from the parked car.  This plays heavily on his conscience and his psychic well-being as the film goes on.  He goes everywhere from the seedy streets of the inner-cities and ghettos as a cocaine dealer and manages to get all the way to the highest ranks of the organization.  He does this by working his way into the circle of a mid-level drug distributor.  A supposedly clean-shaven man who owns a house, has a beautiful wife, and an eight-year-old daughter whom he practices the multiplication tables with in the morning.  This key character is played with nervous ingenuity by Jeff Goldblum, in one of his most impressive performances, and is the symbol of the disturbing depths that a man's greed can go to.All of this, while extremely strong assets, are more or less pretty routine in films such as these.  Director Bill Duke, however, manages to take it a step further and elevates this film with style and class.  He has Fishburne narrate the story and allows the langage to be poetic and colorful, something that derives from classic 1940s film noir.  My favorite line in the narration is on Fishburne's first day on the streets as a dealer when the voice-over says ""The great thing about life on the streets is you know how it's gonna be.  It's always the same.  It's always getting worse.""  The strongest and most potent scenes in the film are the ones dealing directly with Fishburne's struggles with the moral decisions he must make.  The ""deeper"" involved he gets in the criminal life, the more he begins to realize the cold and inhuman manner with which the government and authorities have been cast.  It's not that he decides he likes being a drug dealer, it's actually the exact opposite.  He becomes more and more determined to infiltrate the organization, by any means necessary, no matter how violent and chaotic it gets.  As I said, the film does begin to lose its bottom by the end, as the plot becomes slightly overblown, however, I won't go into details as it would spoil some surprises.  And overall the courage and conviction of the performances causes you to forget the lackluster final quarter.  Roger Ebert said that this was ""a drama disguised as a thriller"" and I will have to agree with that statement.  It is much more dependent on characters than on action scenes, and that is what makes it so much better and more intelligent that most of its genre.  Everywhere in this film there is the unmistakeable look and feel of the early '90s, whether it's in the great soundtrack, the sharp cinematography, the fast-paced editing and camera movements, or the screen sweeps that segue from scene to scene.  It was a good time in movies and music, if you ask me, but this film has aged much better than its closest companion 'New Jack City' has.  Possibly one of the most overlooked cop films of the '90s.",N/A
1291655,"Family dysfunction is given a lugubrious, sentimental treatment by writer/director Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) in what is actually a remake of a 1990 Italian film,Stanno tutti bene, written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, no stranger to sentiment since he made the neo-classic ""Cinema Paradiso"". The earlier film starred the legendary Marcello Mastroianni as a Sicilian civil servant who travels throughout Italy to pay surprise visits to his children after his wife has died. This mirror version stars the equally legendary Robert De Niro as Frank Goode, a former blue-collar worker living in upstate New York, doing the same thing with his grown children. The first part of the plot reminds me of an even earlier classic, Yasujiro Ozu'sTokyo Story, which told the story of an elderly couple who visit their grown children in Tokyo only to discover they have no time for them. That film was a subtle classic that didn't telegraph its emotional impact around contrived plot turns.The same cannot be said for this turgid 2009 drama which bears the sometimes unbearable stamp of manipulation in Jones' overly deliberate treatment with sometimes too-perfectly composed shot compositions courtesy of Henry Braham's immaculate cinematography. The plot follows Frank on his voyage of discovery as he settles into his unfulfilling widowed existence. After being rebuffed by his four children to come home for the holidays, he decides to take matters into his own hands and visit each one of them despite a serious heart ailment. He begins to realize it was his wife who had been the emotional conduit that kept the family in touch despite the divergent paths they all took. Frank sets out by train and bus to surprise each of them in their locales. The first is David, an artist living a boho-type lifestyle in Manhattan, but he isn't home for reasons that will become clear later in the story. Then it's off to see Amy, a successful, Type-A Chicago advertising executive living a life out of the pages of Architectural Digest.Frank moves on to Denver to meet his son Robert, a symphony percussionist whom Frank thought was a conductor, and finally to Las Vegas where he visits Rosie, a dancer living in a luxurious apartment. Needless to say, things are not what they appear, and Frank becomes aware of how estranged he truly has become from his children as revelations start to unfold like clockwork. As an actor, De Niro seems to have settled into a relatively passive figure only evoking the heat of his past performances during key moments. Unfortunately, that happens in the film's worst scene, a hallucinogenic fantasy scene where Frank is talking to his memory of his children as toddlers only to have them talk back like their adults (a bit like the classroom scene in Woody Allen'sAnnie Hallbut without the laughs). Otherwise, De Niro makes his character a befuddling, somewhat endearing presence throughout. Kate Beckinsale plays Amy efficiently but not too deeply. The ad pitch during her sequence is the one unexpectedly funny bit in the whole film.Sam Rockwell fares better as the son since the sense of disappointment is palpable between father and son in his scenes with De Niro. Drew Barrymore uses her natural warmth and likeability to play Rosie as Frank's obvious favorite, a daughter who won't do anything to let her father down. The always watchable Melissa Leo (Frozen River) shows up in a convenient but touching cameo as a sympathetic truck driver who bonds with Frank over their recent spouse losses. The whole plot executes on a series of conveniences such as the blatant connection between Frank's former job in covering PVC cables and the overlapping voiceovers of the siblings on moving images of telephone wires. The 2010 DVD release is weak as these types of releases go with the only extras being seven deleted/extended scenes (interesting but excisable) and an interview with Paul McCartney, who wrote and performed the appropriately sentimental song, ""I Want to (Come Home)"", played over the closing credits.",N/A
1253020,"SORORITY ROWAh remakes, those pesky little things they just keep on popping up on us. Well this one is a few years old but still I think you know what I mean. This of course is a remake from the slasher pic ""House on Sorority Road"" and is not all bad. I went into this expecting another horrible film and came out kinda liking it. Now it is not a classic and I don't think you will find anything new here, but it is ok.From the title I bet you can guess this is college related and is about none other than a sorority. Yes indeed I know that is a shock but that is what it is about. And like any good horror flick it is about a group of females, you know what that means. You guessed right kiddies, lots of blood, death, and naked girls; I know it doesn't sound that bad. The film follows a group of sorority sisters that play a prank, said prank goes wrong and a fellow sister is dead. Of course from there the ""ladies"" and the prank victim decide that they should dump the body as not to ruin any graduation plans and life after school. The leader of this group is particularly all about image and not going to jail, that makes her kinda fun.Time goes by and it is graduation time which of course means party time, why not,  you only killed a so called ""sister"". So like any good teenish horror flick a killer pops up and knows what these girls have done. Will the killer go to the police with the information, no silly, said person would not be named killer for no reason. So the girls start to get threatening texts and videos and stuff to their phones. This of course only leads to multiple deaths in various ways.Now I have to say one thing first off, I could never take a killer seriously if they started texting me. I am not a texter and refuse to read them when some one sends me one, therefore I wouldn't even know there was a killer after me. If some one has something to tell me then they can call me. Any way as for the deaths this is a pretty good flick but everything else is your typical new age horror flick. I will say that the first part of this film is really good. The build up to the prank and the entire prank scene are really well done, and the aftermath at the scene is just as strong if not stronger. Everything after that is just your typical flare.The acting is everything you would expect from this type of film, which is good because that is what this type of film calls for. The leader of the sorority is wonderfully evil here, especially in the aftermath scene of the prank. Any way this is a good enough flick for a rental I would guess and who knows you may like it better than me. Was this a classic, no, but was it fun, yes.",Sorority Row

While there's never once a sense or flavor of New York - this is pure Hollywood all the way - Scorsese's mixture of stylised settings and naturalistic drama goes beyond the traditional happy ending and takes what starts out a standard boy-meets-girl musical plotline into darker emotional territory. It may lose its way towards the and (partially due to the overlong Happy Endings number taking us away from the characters for too long), but it gets a lot more right than it gets wrong, and has a great use of color.

Fundamentally I think the movie was well directed, shot, etc., but I just didn't care for the story in general. Somehow I felt like I was intruding in very private--well--sessions and breaching a therapeutic and spiritual confidentiality.

353930,"City of Death is distinguished from the other Tom Baker Who episodes by virtue of two things: 1) it is essentially a comedy, rather than a campy drama with strong tongue-in-cheek humor (like most Who episodes) and 2) there is a definite, quasi-romantic vibe going between Tom Baker and his wife (and ex-wife) to be, Lala Ward. Maybe it was the Paris setting; maybe Tom and Lala were so ga-ga for each other at this point they couldn't hide it; but I can't recall any episode with any female companion where the relationship seems quite so intimate. These two factors make ""City"" a bit of a departure from the norm. I am not as enamored of this episode as many fans are, but it is still very enjoyable. On the downside, I found the long travelogue shots of Paris to be a bit boring and time-consuming, the actor who plays Professor Kirinsky to be a giant ham, and some of the plot elements to be absurd beyond the usual level of absurdity (no one in that cafe seems to care about the goons who keep coming in to stick up the Doctor at gunpoint). Those are, however, pretty weak criticisms. On the plus side, Baker, who was beginning to flag a bit in his enthusiasm for the role at this point in his seven-year run, clearly had a ball with the fast-paced, completely comedic script. His biggest strength as an actor was always his ability to recognize when a plot moment or bit of dialogue was ridiculous, and then use humor to make it fly. In this episode he gets plenty of chances and clearly enjoyed all of them. The Duggan character was hackneyed (nice trenchcoat) but also quite funny as a sort of male Leela who is not terribly bright but terribly keen on breaking things and punching people in the face. His interplay with the Doctor is very good (""Duggan, if you do that again I am going to take very severe measures with you."" ""Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?"" ""I'm going to ask you not to do it again.""), and he works equally well with Romana. Skaroth's polite, homicidal butler is also a huge kick (""Kill those two fools please, Harold,"" says Skarroth. ""With pleasure, sir,"" replies the butler). The brass ring however goes to Julian Glover as Skarroth/Count Scarleoni, who sci-fi fans will always remember as General Veers in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", one of the fortunate imperial officers who Vader does not strangle for ineptitude. Glover has beautifully campy dialogue and he plays it out with relish as a profoundly evil villain who never loses his sense of whimsy or humor (""This is going to be a treat. Please remain here while I bring the instruments of torture."") even when he has to wear the disgusting Jaggeroth costume. The plot seemed thin and somewhat confusing at times as it goes along, but everything ties in very nicely at the end....except for the fact that for such a warlike race, the Jaggeroth don't seem to be able to take a punch very well. I guess that's why they're extinct. Anyway, while I don't regard ""City of Death"" as a classic, it remains a must-have for the true fan's collection.",Doctor Who - City of Death VHS

619703,"The problem with this movie is that it doesn't really know what it wants to say.  It is artfully done, however, with a lot of quiet, gentle touches, and it is very pretty to look at, so you're not supposed to notice.  But it takes no risks, and leaves you nothing to mull over when you walk out of the theater.  It's a bit of fluff--a pretty bit of fluff to be sure--but a bit of fluff nevertheless.  What is bizarre is that this beginner's piece has garnered so much solemn critical praise.Bill Murray plays an actor who is in Tokyo to take part in a commercial for some kind of booze.  He hates Tokyo, he hates Japan, and he hates the commercial he is doing.  From the telephone conversations he has with his wife and the faxes that are sent to him from his family, we are meant to realize that he doesn't particularly care about them either.  He's completely bored and cynical about everything, and he sits around in the hotel lounge in the evening listening to awful lounge music and drinking.  In the meantime, we are told that for this job he is making two million dollars, and he is accosted on several occasions by strangers who recognize him from the many film roles he played earlier in his career.  He is thankless for all that he has and for all that he has been able to do, and is an utterly unlikable, contemptible human being.So far, so good.  Undoubtedly, there are hundreds if not thousands of people like this in Hollywood, stewing in their juices because of some idiotic part they didn't get, or angry that they must travel to Japan or Australia for a publicity stunt they consider to be beneath their dignity.  Oh, how one yearns for a contemporary movie like this, one which satirically exposes the over-inflated ego and vapidity of the Hollywood star.But unfortunately, very early on, we realize that this is not going to be the case.  Instead we are meant to empathize with this Murray character.  We are supposed to feel sorry for him!  The Japanese really are goofy and buffoonish.  Their city really is a pinball machine, with neon electronica, videos and shallowness portrayed everywhere.  They don't understand English--the clods--no matter how condescendingly Mr. Murray tries to explain things to them.All of the jokes, few as they are, are made at the expense of the Japanese.  Murray is taller than them.  He looks at us bleakly over their heads.  They greet him every morning in an ingratiatingly polite manner.  He's bored.  He makes ugly jokes about their food, comparing it at one point to his new friend's bruise:  ""Black toe,"" he derisively orders.  They don't understand.  We're supposed to laugh.  How wonderful it would be for the Sushi chef to announce to him that he indeed understands English, and crack him over the head with a rolling pin.  But no.  The chef instead is an incomprehending, smiling moron, and the smirking Mr. Murray is oh so clever.So he meets this girl--freshly graduated from Yale, very pretty and improbably a philosophy major--who is just as lonely as he.  (Will Hollywood please stop trying to portray philosophy or math or science majors?  They can't.)  Her husband is a photographer and he's gone all the time, so one night she buys Mr. Murray--thirty years her senior--a drink, and they subsequently go out and do a few things together, and oh, how touching, they help to make each other feel a little less lonely.  They never have sex.  And that's the plot.But what in the world are we supposed to think about this?  That Japan is some sort of lost hell in which white people must cling to one another?  That beautiful young women far from home can be comforted by cynical, drunken old men?  Really, and seriously, what is the point?There is a moment or two when it appears that the director, Sofia Coppola, was trying for one.  There is a great scene in which Murray is playing golf, on a beautiful green course, alone, and with an incredible Mt. Fuji as a backdrop.  What a lucky guy, we think.  How can he be so unhappy?  But very quickly after we are again manipulated into believing that things truly are an awful nightmare for him, and that it is only his burgeoning relationship and his quirky sense of humor that are pulling him through.  Some nightmare.This basic contradiction is why the movie fails.  Why should we, the nine-to-five, slobbering, popcorn-fed public, feel sorry for this self-centered, pampered ass?So it misses, and misses badly.  It may be Murray, who is clearly out of his league, playing the role the same way he's played everything else:  the wise-cracking, likable, sardonic smart-aleck.  (How can he have been nominated for an Academy award for this?  He's done it forever and it is clearly out of place here.)  Or is it Coppola, who was unable to rein him in, or perhaps too inexperienced to have a firmer understanding of this subtle theme?Hard to tell.  It should be said, though, that this is not an awful or horrible movie.  Indeed, from a director so young, it shows a great deal of promise.

1149897,"I didn't hate this version of Room With a View.  Yes, I have seen the Merchant Ivory version.  Yes, I have read the book. Although I thought the cast of the Merchant Ivory production was magnificent, I actually like a great deal of the cast in this adaptation as well, so I was prepared to view this with an open mind and not hate it instantly because it wasn't Merchant Ivory.  I have seen several of this cast (Cassidy, Cusak, Thompson, Spall) in other productions and thought they were wonderful.  The aspects of this production I found most disappointing were the script and direction.  I found the dialogue to be lackluster, and the interpretation of some of the characters (primarily Cecil) just plain dull.  I have admired some of Davies' adaptations in the past, but his more recent works seem to have an underlying conceit in them that I find distasteful, as though he would deign to ""improve"" the works of the authors he is adapting.  Davies is, indeed a gifted and talented man, but is he really so lofty that he feels capable of enhancing Austen, Forster, and Waugh?  He had a wonderful cast of people to work with for this adaptation, but their performances were never going to reach the stellar level they were capable of when the script they were given to work with was second rate.  I know there was a time limitation, but the story was just diluted and unnecessary additions were made (the additional meeting with the gig driver, George's death, etc)that seemed to serve no purpose other than to needlessly outrage the audience.  I don't understand why Davies feels the need to shock a response out of his audience, rather than impress them with quality.  That cheapens the whole production.  This production wasn't awful, but if could have been so much better.",Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View

But about halfway through the film, the deeper themes rise to the surface and ""Ladder 49"" begins to explore complex issues in a mature way.

621879,"After I watched this movie I felt empty, lifeless, boring.  Then I remembered this was made in Hollywood.  Duh!  Here's the script:  The movie is about people in quirky New England.  You watch them live their lives.  Everything seems sort of normal in the beginning.  There are marital problems between Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger, but it seems like they are handling it maturely.  Insert here a college boy (hollywood suggests this fellow is your average college duude) to act as our sort of, on-camera witness to this family.  As the movie unfolds, you realize Jeff and Kim do not behave like normal people do.  Finally you find out why they are all screwed up.  And then it ends.  I guess in Hollywood, its OK to be sociopathic if you have a troubled past.  Hollywood rationalizes self-destructive behavior.  So what else is new?Don't try to figure out the door in the floor or what kind of publisher would call ""that"" a childrens story.  There is tragedy in the lives of these rich people and they have difficulty with day to day life.  The way they cope is both humorous and tragic.  Watch this movie for the lighter side.  See it to enjoy attractive naked people (sans Jeff Bridges).  Tom Cruises' ex, Mimi Rogers, bares it all.  Kim, just about all.  Both are still in great shape.  Laugh at the silly situations these addled rich people get themselves into.  Find humor in the college dudes doofusness.That's all your going to get, though, sporadic chortles.  Its a souped-up reality TV show. You get to watch people do stupid things (see Jackass, the Movie), but you don't learn anything.  Except how to wallow in your own misery... with panache.  I gave it three stars because the actors really gave it a good effort, in spite of a pretty weak storyline.I got teased into the DVD because of the cover.  Ebert gave it two thumbs up.  Basinger (?) and Bridges got good acting reviews.  Interesting tag line.  Though the writer and director may think otherwise, this movie is like King Kong or Lord of the Rings; nothing more than a hollywood fantasy without special effects - though they may have done a little airbrushing on Kim.",N/A
1228588,"Let me start by saying that I consider Sean Connery the best Bond, but among everyone else that has played this role Daniel Craig is in my mind a clear second. In this movie, Craig does a fine job, but I found the script a little bit of a mess. The action starts right after the end of Casino Royale, and we are thrown into the middle of an action packed sequence that is hard to follow. Not only because we don't really know what is going on, but also because the way in which the action scene is presented is too frenetic and it's hard to even see who is who in many instances and determine what is actually happening.I like action movies, but it annoys me when in an effort to make the action super high pace, the directors go over the top and we end up with meaningless sequences of events. Luckily for this film, once those initial moments pass, things get better. There is actually an interesting plot in place, with Bond suffering from the loss of  loved one and walking the thin line between going rogue and doing his job. As usual, there is suspense and intrigue, mixed with action and romance.This film is definitely not boring, but it is lacking some of those distinctive traits I have come to love in Bond movies, such as the off the cuff humor. Overall I was entertained, but it it not a Bond movie that will come to mind if someone has never watch a film with this character and asks me for advice on which one to try.",N/A

But when the spotlight moved off him to the more radical street stunts by new players, his life, ego and mind apparently imploded into a dark hole.

734148,"Two things must be known by the viewer before they see this movie in order for them not to be disappointed. One, this doesn't take a very realistic approach to the cryptozoological creature known as Bigfoot or Sasquatch (for those who believe in it, anyway). And two, this is a typical low-end monster flick that was never meant to be any kind of masterpiece, but rather an accomplice to popcorn and a lonely weekday's night.The story isn't a very complex one. Lance Henriksen and his little expedition group have traveled up in the snowy mountains in an attempt to find his daughter, whose plane crashed there and no one knows what had happened (or even if they survived). Also there (for the greedy part of the gang), lost in the mountains, is a nifty little device that, once they recover it, may hold the proof of Sasquatch's existence. As it turns out, it does. (Since the movie is nothing of a genius plot, I'm about to spoil the story a little bit) A family member of Sasquatch was killed by the plane as it crashed to the ground. If that didn't piss him off enough, there's that stinkin' box-like device that can prove his existence. So, he chases and tries to slaughter Henriksen's team, wanting to make sure that box doesn't leave his woods (yeah, it's getting a bit silly, isn't it?). By the end of the movie, Henriksen faces off with the beast (the others have left, but he insisted on staying behind and killing the monster). I won't spoil the very end for you, but trust me, it's just as silly and full of plot-holes as the rest of the film.Sasquatch certainly fails to present an interesting or scary monster flick. On the other hand, there are plenty of nights when boredom is your only company that it could very possibly entertain you. One highlight of the film is the fact that there is little to no CGI used for the creature. The suit isn't all that pathetic, either. They did make a wise choice by showing as little of the monster as they could, since it wasn't a very believeable costume if given a closer and clearer inspection. In short, the only reason to see Sasquatch is if you're bored and have that craving for a hairy monster stalking people in the woods. And for that, it's pretty enjoyable.",N/A

Even more then that though, I'm still having trouble grasping whether it's my kind of film, and all the while, I just try to grasp the story in it's entirety.The plot is like this.  In the days where pop-idols were supposedly pure, Mima Kirigoe retires, and begins anew in acting as a way to fit into the ever-changing business of stardom.  However, this may mean compromising all she knows, and giving up what she loved.  Even more then this, murderous minds follow, as the world Mima once knew collapses, and the new world twists and turns into that of nightmares.Psychological thriller is one way to put it, as it clear delves into the minds, characters and viewers alike.  However, many deeper films that I like have a relative point; and regretfully, for my tast at least, I cannot find that sense of closure I love.  That's not giving away the ending in the least bit, because I am merely discussing the overall.However, if you feel mature enough to attempt a relatively complex and adult plot, about a girl dealing with a definitely complex world, then this is all yours, and hopefully it may muse you.",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS

Can I recommend it? Only if you are a huge fan of horror from all time periods and do not expect too much from this film. Don't get me wrong. Its not a bad movie, just not as great as many of the reviews I see glorifying it. You will have to decide on your own about whether its worth a purchase or not.

1400953,"Zack Snyder just hasn't made the same impact on me that he apparently has on the rest of the moviegoing population. I enjoy his work, but it always seems like there's something to be desired when his films finally fade to black. With Sucker Punch, Snyder isn't really looking to change the formula his films have become notorious for, but the storyline just didn't sit right with me. We know ahead of time that this is all taking place in Baby Doll's head? That's like knowing ahead of time that Teddy Daniels is patient 67 in Shutter Island. Oh wait, we kind of did and that still turned out pretty great. Sucker Punch is fairly disappointing on one hand, but mostly just incredibly entertaining on the other.The Zack Snyder formula mentioned usually just involves heavy use of slow motion while most of his films have a particular look to them like they're all sent through the same filter before reaching the screen while also feeling like they all taking place in the same universe. Snyder became notorious for his R-Rated films, but then broke that mold with Legend of the Guardians. Sucker Punch is Snyder's first PG-13 film, so don't expect a lot of gratuitous gore, endless strings of profanity or graphic sex scenes on spaceships that last an incredibly long time since there's none of that. If you're a fan of any of Snyder's work, Sucker Punch still hits all the same buttons that films like 300 and Watchmen did; the action sequences are still insane and the slow motion technique is used in a way that adds a bit of gusto to each scene it's used in. When the girls first arrive on the train and they're in the middle of trying to retrieve a kitchen knife, a gun is fired as we see the bullet bounce off and shatter a robot's head. The shell then flies by the screen as we hear the air in the room howl through the shell before it falls to the ground. So if you're a doubter of the PG-13 rating, it doesn't really affect much here.This film is like a man's action movie fantasy. It's like Sucker Punch tries to roll everything a guy would enjoy in a film like hot women, heavy gunfire, a mother dragon who basically makes explosions come to her, and enough insanity injected into its most adrenaline racing scenes to keep you talking around the water cooler for hours. It's like trying to combine Showgirls, the Dawn of the Dead remake, Dead Snow, The Lord of the Rings, and I, Robot into one movie. During that same train sequence, I could've sworn the score suddenly paid homage to Terminator 2. Sucker Punch makes sure to tickle all of the brain cells in your head that are still attached to action films from your past.While the film's charm mostly comes from its action scenes and the films they pay tribute to, the flaws in Sucker Punch aren't exactly minimal. The main one being that the film's constant use of music with vocals makes Sucker Punch feel like the director's cut of an extended music video. There are three songs used practically in full in the first thirty to forty five minutes of the film among countless others as the film progresses. The film also takes place within two layers of the mind in addition to what's actually happening in reality, which makes the film feel like a less complicated version of Inception. The plan that Baby Doll comes up with seems a little too grandiose for its own good with such little payoff at times. Do you really have to dance to go to another reality where you're fighting robots on a train while trying to disarm a bomb before it explodes all for nothing more than a kitchen knife? It honestly just felt like a group of guys got together and threw all their favorite action movies into a pot and created a film with an amazing looking incoherent film before coming back around and adding a story to it to try and make everything have some sort of meaning.At the end of the day, Sucker Punch is basically just a glorified music video with really spectacular eye candy. The film can also be considered a fanboy's wet dream. If you're a guy, Sucker Punch is practically guaranteed to at least touch upon at least one of the things you look for and love in an action film. Whether it's giant samurai warriors wielding Gatling guns, steam powered zombie soldiers, hideous orcs and fire breathing dragons, an overbearing clan of bloodthirsty robots, or the fact that you just like to watch scantily clad, young women annihilate their enemies with nothing more than a blade and an endless supply of bullets, Zack Snyder's latest probably has you covered. Sucker Punch may not be the best written film of the year, but it's an action film that can still be considered a hell of a lot of brainless fun.",Sucker Punch
1487578,"Django Unchained started out great and ended up okay, but somewhere in the middle, it fell a little too in love with itself and the pacing slowed to a crawl. Django is freed and then starts to work with a German bounty hunter, who is a wonderful character. When they go to Candie Land, a plantation where Django's wife is being kept, that's where the movie just fell apart for me. Leo DiCaprio is Candie, and he turns in a good performance, but there's a lot of repetitive dialogue and plodding revelations. Django allows a slave to be torn apart by dogs, which made him an unsympathetic character, whereas before that moment, he was pretty cool. Yes, there's a lot of blood - lots of juicy gun fights. Some of it is way over the top, but that's what you expect out of a Tarantino film, so I have no objection to that.

661866,"I've been wanting to get this movie since reading a rather breathless review on Planet Out a couple of years ago.It's a better movie than I expected, but you should know it's not a gay love story.  Our hero, Pol, played by Alan Paule, is determinedly hetero but turns to hustling to raise money for his impoverished family.  To this end, he goes to Manila and becomes a male (macho) dancer in a sex club.  You may make of that what you will, the film, is non-judgmental.  Pol maintains a certain detachment from his chosen craft; the cover art for the CD is taken from the one scene in which he genuinely seems to enjoy being erotic with another guy and Pol's lovemaking scene with Bambi, a cute, sassy young female Philippino in the same situation, is the hottest scene in the movie.There's only one character in the film who appears to have homo-erotic tendencies, Noel, played by Daniel Fernando, and he ends up tragically.  His was the more interesting and attractive character to me.  There's only one gay kiss that isn't just for the sake of the show at the sex club and Pol is genuinely surprised that Noel would kiss him on the lips other than when they're on stage.There is a lot of simulated eroticism and near total male nudity, even a little total male nudity (one brief scene in which a bunch of the dancers are on stage masturbating - shot from across the room, not close up) and a lot of simulated sex acts.  Pol is pretty good at undulating and gyrating in a g-string; Noel is even better.Maybe as much as a third of the movie consists of these scenes of male dancers, serving as backdrop for a morality tale involving Pol and Noel and Noel's sister in which the heavy is the police official who ""protects"" this aspect of Philippino society.  To the extent the film is a commentary on social conditions which give rise to all of this prostitution, it paints a much direr picture of the young Philippino girls who are drawn into this trade than of the young men.  I've read the film is a searing indictment of the corruption that existed under the Marcos and Aquino regimes.  I lack the knowledge of Philippino society to judge this statement, but ""The Comedians"" with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor was a searing indictment of life in Haiti under Papa Doc and this film has nowhere near the power of that one.So much of the film is devoted to the scenes at the sex clubs it's difficult to believe the filmmaker was simply producing an indictment of political corruption but I'm not sure what else to make of it.The acting is better than I expected, as is the filmmaking, but this DVD was produced from a very old and scratchy copy of the film and is the worst visually I've ever seen.Planet Out is incapable of giving anything less than a breathless review to any film in which at least one malecharacter takes his shirt off but I give this film only 3 stars.",N/A

259208,"If you go into THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY with the idea that you will learn anything factual about Michelangelo, Pope Julius II, the Sistine Chapel, and Renaissance Rome--much less art--you are in for a rude awakening.  Historians were quick to point out that the film was even less historically accurate than the Irving Stone bestseller on which it was based.  Film critics were also harsh: while they described the film as competent, by and large they felt that a movie so crammed with notable talents should have been quite a bit better than it actually was.There is some truth to these accusations.  As a whole, THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY is essentially a prettified and cleaned-up 1965 idea of the characters and story it offers.  Even the alleys are well-swept and the servant drudges remarkably clean, and in terms of visuals and designs the film is nothing so much than THE SOUND OF MUSIC gone Italian.  The dialogue is remarkably pretentious and the plot extremely repetitive.  And certainly neither Charleton Heston nor Rex Harrison were anything like Michelangelo or Pope Julius II.Even so, the film works unexpectedly well on its own merits.  Heston and Harrison may be incredibly miscast, but they both play with considerable conviction, and their clashing styles lend surprising believability to their scenes together.  While a more accurate portrait of the era would be more interesting, one can't complain about the entertainment value involved; there is always something to see on the screen.  And although director Carol Reed and writer Philip Dunne play fast and loose with the facts, the story they offer is quite entertaining.This is not a great masterpiece of cinema, but it is a lot of fun to watch--as long as you don't take it too seriously as either history or art.  The bonus package is quite slight, but the restoration is very nice, and the film comes with the original and interesting documentary on Michelangelo's works that prefaced it when it was in theatrical release.  While I would not place this on a short of list of films to own, it is a pleasant enough way to spend a rainy night, particularly if you are looking for a film the entire family can watch together.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",N/A
1614474,"Having read most of these reviews, I'd like to mention some aspects of the film no one else did. The mad Russian scientist was only vaguely Russian, but that's ok. Like any good mad scientist, he loved his creations. ""You are so beautiful"" he effuses right before the Mega Queen spears him through and through. He doesn't seem to mind this, since he is so happy his experiments came to a successful end. Pretty amusing. Also, I thought there were two daughters, one of whom gets eaten in the worst possible way. No one mentioned her after, not least her parents, or any of you reviewers.  I thought that was odd. Anyway, sometimes the spiders would grow too big as they did what they do. A three foot tall spider doesn't become 6 feet tall just because it jumps on some hapless guy. We also have the incredible shrinking and the later gets bigger again Queen spider. Not good. What about the fact that the spiders were crossed with alien DNA? This would have been good to explore, but no one ever mentions it again. Since the aliens were found on a crashed spacecraft, maybe they weren't that smart after all, so their intelligence had no effect on the spiders. I dunno. On the plus side, the affection of the Mad Scientist for the spiders is almost touching. Also, the acting was ok, except for the younger daughter, who was pretty good. Too bad though that at certain moments she seemed almost casual about trying to evades angry arachnids. As I said, the film is uneven. I loved the tap-tippet-tap of little and not so little spider feet, and I'm willing to overlook the fact that spiders don't have queens. It wasn't that gory, which I liked since I'm sick of all these 'Saw' wannabe flicks that are so nasty I have to stop the movie. (I guess I'm a bit of a wimp.) Good story, ,though, and good pacing. It's good that things started slowly and then sped up gradually. It made this flick different. CGI was good too. An uneven flick, but break out the popcorn and enjoy.

Most actors were British and they seemed completely out of place playing Germans and having an actor from Egypt playing one of he main roles as a German major was just too much. So much for casing in the 1960's. The story is great and if remade with unknowns or Germans would be more believable. Still recommended.,The Night of the Generals VHS

They're guided by the mysterious thunder god  Raiden (Christopher Lambert), who... doesn't fight. He's just kind of a Yoda.But even before the three fighters arrive at the island where the tournament will take place, they're confronted by danger -- Shang Tsung has brought his deadliest three fighters to destroy all three of them, and they don't care much about rules. Can the gang overcome their personal issues and win Mortal Kombat? Can you guess? Do I even need to ask?I openly admit it: I have never played ""Mortal Kombat"" video games, so I had no preconceptions about what this movie would be like.As for what it actually is like: a lot like watching an action anime when they get to the inevitable tournament -- lots of creative action scenes involving flames, ice-balls, a guy with four arms, and people wandering through a shadowy, cobwebbed palace. It's mindless, overserious, cheesy fun and... somehow it doesn't bother me.And I won't sugarcoat it: this is a plotless, bubblegum movie with all the important twists phoned in about ten minutes before they happened. I mean, did anyone NOT think Shang Tsung would shapeshift into Liu Kang's brother at some point to mess with his head? OF COURSE HE WOULD. AND DID. But somehow I can't hate it. It's just... kinda fun.The actors are mostly of the they're-okay-but-not-great -- Shou is pretty likeable as Liu Kang despite the random tantrums he has, Wilson is mildly annoying, Ashby's one-liners are so annoying that you'll want to drop an anvil on him (""I pay money, you carry the bags""), and Lambert is hugely underused. But Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is weirdly fun as Shang Tsung -- he always seems to be sitting halfway between ""affably evil"" and just EVIL.""Mortal Kombat"" is cheesy, cliched but still somehow entertaining -- perhaps it's all the more entertaining because you know you're only in it for the buttkicking.",N/A

I love to see anything that he is in whether I like the plot of the film or not. Also I was grossed out by fug ugly Talulah Riley and that fat dj man who was gross and perverted.

1062666,"This movie is a mixed bag if ever there was one. At times there are some truly funny moments found beneath the many layers of terrible writing and bad acting. Other times, you just want to hang your head in shame that you are even taking time out of your life to watch this movie. Unfortunately, the viewer is sent on a roller-coaster that is constantly bouncing back and forth between the two extremes.Although the title of this film is ""Epic Movie"", the truth is that the majority of the movies spoofed wouldn't be considered epic on any level. Nevertheless, the hodge podge of various movies, TV shows, and public figures that are spoofed in this film manage to come together in a barely cohesive mess that does entertain on some levels.The films and TV shows parodied include -- Chronicles of Narnia -- X-Men -- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Johnny Depp version) -- Da Vinci Code -- Nacho Libre -- Snakes on a Plane -- Borat -- A Christmas Story -- MTV Cribs -- Mission Impossible -- Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle -- Superman Returns -- Punk'd -- Harry Potter -- Pirates of the Carribean -- Star Wars -- Click -- Talladega Nights...the list is fairly endless.Some of these spoofs take up far more screen time than others, while some are barely noticable as they are merely a blip on the radar in the form of a small sight-gag, or a single line of dialogue. The movie even manages to squeeze in a few not-so-subtle insults to various celebrities, such as Paris Hilton and her ""That's Hot"" catch-phrase, Samuel L. Jackson and the massive internet buzz his movie ""Snakes on a Plane"" generated, causing a script re-write to include a specific line of dialogue, Mel Gibson's embarrassing arrest for a DUI, and even Kanye West's bizarre rant while doing a guest spot with Mike Meyers.Unfortunately, this movie fell incredibley flat, as did it's predecessorDate Movie (Unrated Edition), although I must say that I think they are making some steps in the right direction as far as improving. While ""Date Movie"" was a terrible, incohesive mess, ""Epic Movie"" manages to create a small semblence of cohesivness, and gives the illusion of not being a movie that looks like nothing but a bunch of badly written sketches that are strung together with little thought towards sequencing and plot development (whew -- that sentence was a mouthful).On a more positive note, there are *many* fun special features to be found on the unrated disc, including directors commentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, an alternate ending, and a wide variety of mini-featurettes (you have to see it to believe it). There are even intriguing special features such as one titled ""How Gratuitous"" in which you watch the movie with this feature turned on, and whenever a little beaver icon pops up on the screen, you select the icon to watch additional gratuitous footage of your favorite hotties from the movie.As was the case with ""Date Movie"", this disc attempts to make up for the sub-par film by giving us a myriad of fun special features. If they put half as much effort into making the movie as they do in making the special features, then maybe it would recieve a better rating than 1, 2, or 3 stars (3 at the absolute most). I myself gave it 3 stars, because they really are trying to improve. I think the effort should be somewhat rewarded, even if the movie itself isn't really deserving of it.Bottom line, give it a try. You might hate it, you might like it, but you'll never know until you subject yourself to the roller-coaster ride.",N/A
1465456,"Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that as Denzel Washington gets older he's playing more and more characters with killer instincts? In SAFE HOUSE, Washington once more plays a character that you hope you never find tracking you down or waiting in your home.The film opens with Washington meeting a member of MI6, Britain's spy agency, and receiving a microchip filled with information. Heading to the bathroom of the restaurant they're in, he injects it into his hip. When the bad guys come knocking on the restroom door Washington dispatches them with ease and escapes. The MI6 agent picks him up in his car but before they can get away he's shot. Washington makes his escape to the American consulate and turns himself in.We discover that Washington's name is Tobin Frost, an ex-CIA agent who went off the grid and has been selling secrets to various organizations around the world. Considered a traitor, the consulate turns out to be in South Africa and he's to be taken to a safe house until a team can get to him and ""extract"" information from him.The safe house is operated by a fairly new agent named Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). It's his first assignment with the CIA and he wants to impress, to move forward. He gets his chance when the information team arrives closely followed by the hit squad that was chasing Frost to begin with. They take out the team but before they can take Frost, Weston escapes with him only to be tracked down. They eventually escape but you know this assassination team will eventually find them.Calling in, Weston is told that he needs to move forward to another location and pick up the means necessary to get Frost to another safe house in South Africa. After picking up the package with various items he needs at lockers in a crowded soccer stadium, Frost causes a scene claiming he's been kidnapped. The security believes him and ignores Weston's pleas only to have Frost kill his guards and escape. Weston follows suit and continues his chase of Frost.But there's more going on here than a simple chase film. The movie is also about what caused Frost to become who he is today and watches as Weston alters from a totally innocent and naive agent into something much more deadly. The fact that Frost has a background in psychological warfare makes the viewer wonder is he just trying to mess with Weston's head or is he trying to help he get a view of the bigger picture? The answer to that question isn't offered until near the end of the film.Another question that runs through the film is the fact that somewhere in the CIA there is a traitor. How is it that the assassination team knew where the safe house was? How have they been able to track down Frost as he moves from place to place? And who gave them the information that led them to him at the beginning of the film? As viewers we wonder about these questions. As a participant, Weston must try and find the answers to these questions as well, never knowing who is an ally or foe.The film moves at a frantic pace with tons of car chases, gun fights and hand to hand combat sequences. Unlike the spy films of the past, people actually get shot, stabbed and bleed. There is a touch more realism here than spy films past. But that goes hand in hand with the story of undeserved loyalty and questions of deciphering who exactly the bad guy is.Washington has never been better. There are subtle plays at work here he delivers that make you wonder if Frost is good, bad or indifferent. The answer is found by the end of the film. Reynolds does an equally great job portraying an innocence in his character that gets jaded as the film progresses. How he ends up, what he will become is also answered by the end of the film.Most films like these today are compared less with Bond and more with Jason Bourne. This film is grittier than the Bourne films and much more so than the Bond series. It will hold your attention and have you guessing from start to finish as to what is actually on the microchip that Frost has possession of. It delivers the goods from start to finish an is well worth taking the time to sit back, watch and enjoy.",N/A

1078573,"To the long and already rambling list of attempts to juice up Sherlock Holmes for mass media audiences, we add this well-meaning but misguided whirlwind.  In what appears to be a pilot that never went to series, Holmes' preteen street squad takes center stage in an attempt to fight through the wall of crime that is Victorian London.  This one is blessed with an excellent Holmes in Jonathan Pryce, but is marred by an inability to decide what story it wants to tell.Some other reviewers have disparaged the way in which this telemovie retcons the role of Irene Adler.  I'm not sure the target audience of young viewers would much care.  I suspect that they would be more interested in the fact that the child characters' hand-wringing is particularly unappealing.  If the kids were to pull their thumbs out, the whole story would be over in thirty minutes.This story has its redeeming moments, particularly when the emphasis shifts to the grown-ups.  But then, why pretend this was produced for kids?  I really liked watching Pryce as Holmes trying to solve the mystery without leaving his lodgings.  The layers he has to work through make these parts of the story interesting.

622711,"Over the past decade, Ben Stiller has displayed a propensity for producing blockbuster comedies, and Along Came Polly is a fun and enjoyable comedy. Although not on the hilarity level of There's Something About Mary, Meet The Parents, or Zoolander - Along Came Polly is nonetheless a funny film (and it's certainly better than the horrid Duplex fiasco with Drew Barrymore). Ben Stiller again plays the role of the nice guy, but this time with a neurotic twist. As a result, the audience still likes his character, just perhaps not as much as some of Stiller's previous roles. But with some hilarious comedy sequences and good one-liners, Along Came Polly manages to keep its viewers entertained quite nicely...Ben Stiller plays the role of Reuben Feffer, an insurance man who avoids risk in every aspect of his life. Measuring everything from the probability of falling through a sidewalk grate to the odds of a piano falling on one's head, he calculates every decision he makes. Following his wedding to Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing), Reuben is devastated when (avoiding the risk of scuba diving), he catches his new bride having an affair with a scuba instructor on their honeymoon. Forced to reevaluate his life, Reuben determines that he needs to take on more risk in his life.With the help of his friend Sandy, Reuben gets out into the public arena once again, where he runs into former junior high school classmate Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston). Polly is the exact opposite of Reuben in almost every way, and he decides to pursue her so as to have more fun in his life. Everything goes well until Lisa returns hoping to win Reuben back, and Polly discovers that Reuben ran a risk analysis on their relationship, determining that Polly was a good risk to take. Now Reuben must decide what to do with his life...Jennifer Aniston, in her role as Polly Prince, turns in another great performance as a leading character's girlfriend (Office Space and Bruce Almighty). Playing a character whose attitude, demeanor, and life are the total opposite of Stiller's, the two Hollywood mainstays are able to save an otherwise adequately written screenplay. Some of the more hilarious scenes involve Reuben's has-been actor friend Sandy Lyle (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who continues to live off of his short-lived fame as ""the kid with the bagpipes"" in a 1980's movie similar to The Breakfast Club. In one scene, Sandy also ""sharts"" (a fart that's a little bit more than a fart), forcing Reuben to leave a party prematurely.Overall, Along Came Polly is a fun and entertaining film that's well worth the time spent. Although Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston have both made better films, it does have its high points. Movie-goers will find this to be a good, light-hearted romantic comedy with Jennifer Aniston and Ben Stiller stealing the show. Because of its headline talent and some good one-liners, Along Came Polly makes the cut as a highly recommended, must-see movie...The DVD Report",N/A

706796,"What really happened during this 'scandal' on a yatch where a film producer met his abrupt end amid a wild weekend of booze, charleston swinging, and dope?We'll never truly know, but the film is a peppy cavalcade of big name stars playing big name stars. It's a character-heavy motion picture so let's discuss the impersonations.Dunst is the flavour of the month, she makes Davies look like an attractively complex figure. While reflecting the verve of a young privileged woman at an exciting time, she maintains a moral core without really being certain of precisely what she wants, which rings true.The flamboyant Eddie Izzard was a surprise in the cast but made an atypically understated Chaplin. You see the intelligence and yearning in his eyes, the sly wit dripping from his casual tilts of the head.Personally, I felt these two were the only admirable actors in the film. The rest of the crew members acted as though they were in a much dopier movie. Herrmann for instance plays Hearst, the big tycoon, as a buffoon channeled through Bill Murray, huffing and puffing when he feels betrayed, grinning goofily and almost cross-eyed when he appears giddy.The film overall is a very watchable one though, particularly if you can overlook a needlessly sepia tone across the board giving a pseudo-noir look. The idea clearly was less to weave a murder mystery yarn and more to splice together the interactions among people at the scene of a high-society and thus hush-hush crime.",N/A
727702,"While never quite as bad as an Alpha or Madacy DVD, Retromedia's titles usually seem to underwhelm for one reason or another (their Faceless Monster transfer is a disastrous must-to-avoid!!). In this case, it's not the movie's fault. The Manster, while hardly a great film, is a perennial sleaze/horror favorite, particularly, it seems, of anyone who was creeped-out by it as a kid on some late-night horror show. The wonderfully nauseating pre-credit sequence sets the tone, as a hairy monster attacks bathing geishas, splattering the rice paper divider with blood. In his mountaintop laboratory, the quite mad Dr. Suzuki keeps his hideously disfigured, slobbering wife Emiko in a cage, and is forced to shoot his ape-like mutant brother Kenji, an ""experiment that didn't work out."" These opening scenes establish a lurid, unwholesome atmosphere that blankets the entire movie like a sickening cloud. Happily married, responsible foreign correspondent Larry Stanford (Peter Dyneley) arrives to interview Dr. Suzuki, who inoculates him with an experimental serum. Larry immediately goes off the deep end: he stops shaving, starts drinking to excess, acting surly, neglecting his job, and lounging around in hot mineral baths with Dr. Suzuki, his secretary Tara, and a bevy of fetching geisha girls (a scene played for Dean Martin-ish double entendres). Larry starts feeling a strange pain in his shoulder, hair periodically grows on his hand, and his wife shows up to collect him, only to find him hot and heavy with Tara. There is an actually quite effective scene where Larry visits a temple filled with scary demon statues and kills a singing monk. Sliding further downhill, he starts hanging around in the street, randomly assaulting stray women, while back at the lab Dr. Suzuki traces Larry's metamorphosis on a line graph. Finally we get the infamous, unforgettable scene where Larry discovers an eye growing out of his shoulder, which quickly matures into a second head that looks like one of those carved coconuts you see in souvenir shops. The rapidly mutating ""manster"" arrives at the lab, kills Dr. Suzuki, grabs Tara, and heads toward the active volcano crater at the top of the mountain. I won't ruin the climax; suffice to say it was a real wow when we were monster-crazed adolescents, but packs a bit less punch today. The Manster is a bit serious, perhaps even dry, in tone for a C-movie of its type (some reviewers have suggested a fairly convincing psychosexual subtext), but moves along at a brisk pace, and offers some of the earliest instances of overtly twisted, ""gross-out"" imagery in a genre that was at the time still heavily dependent on goofy rubber monsters and wholesome heros and heroines. A proto-sleaze mini-classic, prefiguring the full-blown gore movies of just a couple of years later, but enjoyable on a camp level as well.While this DVD definitely qualifies as ""good enough for now,"" it leaves me feeling like there's still a better version possible (there was an official United Artists laserdisc edition years ago). The good news is that the source print shows very little damage, only some light speckling/blemishing, and the tonal values, brightness, and contrast are generally very good to excellent. But many scenes look a bit washed-out and lacking in highlight detail, especially in comparison to my VHS copies (which are admittedly both rather dark), and the overall image suffers slightly from a grainy, dupey look. Essentially a decent transfer of a pretty clean 16mm TV print. Not terrible by any means, but not as crisp and detailed as we're getting used to (spoiled?) with DVD, and not what I'd consider a definitive, must-have release. Maybe I'm too picky; if you just want to re-live the Nightmare Theatre experience, this will probably do fine. The only extras are six chapter stops and a still ""gallery"" consisting of four B&W; glossies and an ad mat. At least there's no annoying ""Drive-In Madness"" featurette. I haven't seen Alpha's DVD edition, but would assume it's worse. Haven't seen Sinister Cinema's DVD-R, either, but would assume it's at least this good or better. As they say, you get what you pay for. All in all, OK for the price, but not a definitive, never-need-to-upgrade edition.",The Manster
96253,"I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, ""Attention K-Mart shoppers!"" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good.",N/A

Honestly I would have liked to see more of the retro characters, but that's just me, having grown up in the '80s arcade era.  Ralph is a clever villain-turned-hero, but his glitch friend really grows old really fast (her voice sounds like an adult trying hard to sound like a child, and it just gets excruciating after awhile, to the point you want to skip ahead past her scenes.)It's an all-ages film for the most part, but there are some scary sequences, namely the final character which, to be honest, I thought was just disturbing and a little too creepy for a kids film.",Wreck It Ralph

1589001,"This is a  weaker film than the first -- a flashy but, especially through its long middle section, rather flaccid offering that would have benefited from a 30- or 40-minute edit.That said, it does right itself in the last 45 minutes -- in itself an unusual event for any off-course movie -- and winds up being bland, general-purpose fun in the same way I imagine water parks are fun on a hot day.I could quibble about the anonymous design of the action scenes (a template seen in far too many films lately), the writing -- moral considerations seem to have been doctored into a number of dialogs -- and overly glitzy production design. But my enduring caveat is that ""Into Darkness"" displays sadly little respect for the franchise's rich history.Granted, the first Abrams film didn't either, but it got away with it  more effectively owing to the alternate-timeline plot. Here, ""Star Trek"" seems little more than a framework and set of characters to be drawn upon at will, irrespective of events in the original series and the earlier films, and less ""reboot"" than reinvention.I can't expand upon this assertion without getting into spoilers, but, in the main, it comes down to the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the chief villain.He is less than effective. I don't blame the actor. Cumberbatch did his best with what he was given -- and he does have one especially resonant scene -- but he was badly miscast in this particular part and for the worst Hollywood sorts of reasons. He should have had weight, and he has none. I wasn't intimidated by his character. I wasn't even interested in him. Heck, I couldn't even identify him without the film telling me who he is.And I should have been able to do so. His first closeup should have been one of those moments where all Star Trek fans draw in their breath and hold it for a second or two.Then, at least, the film would have had one such moment.",Star Trek Into Darkness

It could have all been conveyed and explained in half the time or less.But once it gets going (finally), it's pretty good. Some things are bit predictable, but the slasher-stalking-blind-girl twist is something new to me. I didn't know how I'd feel about that, when we, the audience, can SEE the threat but she can't. It worked, in general, and much to my surprise. One part in particular was applause-worthy for shock value and creativity.The lead in this movie is phenomenal. She exceeded my expectations.There are the expected blood and violence in this movie, of course, but it's not over-the-top. This one does not try to hide behind shocking violence and excessive gore to carry it.I would have enjoyed a little more as to the 'why' besides 'It's Mischief Night', especially when the slasher apparently has taken to attacking the same house at least two years in a row. Really? Kind of lame, especially when there's no explanation offered.A decent movie IF you have the patience to get past the lengthy set-up in the first half of the movie. And, of course, it never hurts when Richard Riehle (a.k.a 'Tom' in Office Space, the 'Jump to Conclusions' matt guy) shows up for a moment or two. Fun to see him pop up in his small part.",Mischief Night

Perhaps this could be attributed to the oppressive government under which the film takes place (people disappear, raids ""just happen"", etc.) but a bit of artistic license would have been appreciated by this viewer to create a better narrative flow.  I felt somewhat taken in because of our cultural inability to accept lesbian sex - this always seems to raise a film's cache unnecessarily.

1456845,"This documentary focuses on Hitler's use of 3D during WWII. He began using 3D photos for propaganda purposes. After all, 3D is impressive...well, I think it is.  There is also a 3D movie clip which might have been used to train  soldiers in the proper use of certain weapons. Later, the Allies began using 3D imagery for aerial reconnaissance.  One of the historians in this documentary is impressed with these WWII, 3D photos & the 3D movie stating that the 3D images help him pick out details that he normally would overlook.  3D wasn't entirely new at that time. Stereoscopic technology has been around  since 1838. I was impressed with the 97 year old Frenchman who has been taking 3D photos for 80 years. Although, Hitler decreed that photography was unlawful, this Frenchman would take photos whenever he was able. (There is an interesting color photo he took of a US soldier).The majority of the photos are black and white. For the most part, the 3D quality of the movie is fine. I saw some crosstalk/ghosting in a few of the old photos.My husband & I found this documentary to be interesting, but not worth $20.

519718,"I am really not quite sure what to say or how to start it. I have never been interested in this legendary story, and this movie hasn't converted me. It is very easy to look at, but it's hard to to follow and hard to keep your attention to it. Director Peter Jackson has, without a doubt, delivered a magnificent looking film. He has created an unbelieveable world thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien, and brought to life some pretty good characters. Still, it wasn't enough for me. Everything about this film is marvelously done and made and acted, but I wasn't swept up by it. Here's the story - A magical ring falls into the hands of a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood), who sets out on a journey to Mordor, to destroy the ring. He is aided and guided by a magical wizard named Gandolf(Superbly done by Sir Ian McKellen). He is also supported by three other hobbit friends, led by Sam(Sean Astin). Along the way they meet up with Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen), an elf(Liv Tyler), and assorted other characters(Played by John Rhys Davies, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean from ""Goldeneye""). Also on hand is horror and film legend Christopher Lee, who gives a fantastic performance that will no doubt make his legion of fans smile proudly. The old master still has it. The storytelling is rich and deep, without question, but I could just never get involved with it. The landscape and cinematography is wonderful and, at times, extremely beautiful. The movie might of floundered if it were held together by a lesser cast. That's the best thing this film has going for it. The cast. Sir Ian is the very best of the bunch. You watch every single frame he's in. Listen to every word he utters. It's hard to say that about the others, but they are all still good. Clocking in at a near 3 hours, the film runs pretty long and certainly drags in a few places, but it usually picks up with some kind of heart pounding scene that grabs your attention. The loyalists and fans will no doubt be pleased and satisfied, but newbies to the story might not be as swept away by the film itself.

But, if you are a Kinks ""completist"" - you probably haven't seen this performance before and might want to check it out. I found it fun to watch, more for the shots (and there are many) of the audience of fans, jumping and screaming (though the crowd noise does not overpower the vocals as on many early Beatles performances.But here is some additional info you should know going in:1) This 1965 performance was probably filmed for French Television (though there are no ""credits"" and location of the venue is not given). The introduction by an announcer is in French (which I don't speak). The camera angles are strange as most shots are from either the back of the theater or the back of the stage. There are quite a few close-ups of Ray Davies but his hair is in front of his face on many shots. And the sound appears a bit out of synch when you see these close-ups.2) The DVD is short - just 20 minutes - with eight songs (indexed by chapter), including their hits (""All Day And all of The Night"", ""You Really Got Me"") and a cover of ""Louie Louie"".3) The sound is acceptable - not hi-fi by any means - and the both the sound and the black and white images are what you usually find in newsreel footage of the era.So, I'm giving it three stars - (Amazon's rating for ""It's OK) - for general entertainment value.

319678,"I cannot add anything to the plot synopses detailed here by other reviewers.  All I have to say about this film is that it is indeed worth a look, if simply to see Bette Davis past her prime years at Warner Bros.The film is talky and if you can sit through it all in one sitting without snoozing from time to time....(I had to watch it four times before I could see it all .....)....you are a great Bette Davis fan and my hat is off to you!This film does have its memorable moments and it is interesting to watch Davis subdued and restrained.  The last shot of the film is particularly moving.It is no surprise that this film did not do well at the box office when it was released in 1948.  Jack Warner, head of production at Warners was tired of Bette at this point and it would only take two more films before he was rid of her.  Studio politics were rampant in Hollywood and forgetting all the millions she made for the studio in the past, relegated her to mediocrity in films like Winter Meeting.However, the film does have its merits....the acting is good (Davis pulls it up to her level and Jim Davis is properly convincing as a war hero torn between a vocation for marriage and a vocation to the priesthood.)Davis made far worse debacles in her career and this film is different because it features Bette in a 'quiet' role for a change.......not one full of hammy mannerisms that tended to taint a lot of her other performances.

796386,"Babylon 5 was always intended to run for five seasons, no more, no less.  Series creator J. Michael Straczynski had a detailed plan for a story that would unfold over five years.  Unfortunately, during the fourth season, it was extremely doubtful that the fifth season would be made.  The PTEN network, which was distributing the show, was collapsing, and there were no other takers.As a result, Straczynski packed more story into season four (in case the series was cancelled), and when the last-minute intervention of TNT saved the show, there wasn't quite enough plot left over.  In addition, TNT insisted on cutting production time by two days per episode, which means that both cast and crew had to make do with fewer rehearsals, less time to shoot and edit.  It's not suprising that so many episodes have a flat, almost colorless feel to them.The real disaster, of course, was the loss of lead actress Claudia Christian.  While her replacement, Tracy Scoggins, surprised me, there's no time left to fully develop a new character, and Scoggins doesn't have the chance to grow into the role.  Even so, Christian's character was such an integral part of the series that her absence is palpable.In spite of these flaws, there are some good episodes, as Londo becomes Emperor (a mixed blessing, to be sure), and the saga of Centauri Prime comes to a close.  This plot line contains the only real drama in Season 5, which is more of a an epilogue than a continuation of the series.As a die-hard fan, I enjoyed Season 5 anyway, but it's true that the series could easily have ended with Season 4.",N/A

371095,"""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", has gotten a bad press over the years since it's unsuccessful release in 1938 and certainly it is one of the lesser efforts of Director Ernst Lubitsch and of both Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper. There are however things of merit in this film that shouldn't be dismissed . While it might lack a lot of the energy and witty lines that are in abundance in Colbert's classic ""Midnight"", and Lubitsch's magnificent ""Ninotchka"", of the following year the film boasts a superlative cast, glamourous settings, sophisticated goings on and a smart snappy pace that keeps the action moving. No classic, it is still good cinema art of the Golden Era of Hollywood.Based loosely on an old Gloria Swanson vechicle of the same name from the 1920's, the story scripted by Billy Wilder has been necessarily  updated to the closing period of the depression era and tells the story of well heeled individuals, or those wishing to be well heeled playing out marital games in a glamourous setting so popular with a viewing audience slowly recovering from the viscitudes of the stark depression years of the early 30's. Central to the story is wealthy American playboy Michael Brandon visiting the Riviera who becomes instantly besotted with the young and attractive Nicole de Loiselle (Claudette Colbert) in a department store where an argument develops over Michael's desire to purchase only the tops of a pair of Pajamas. After agreeing to buy the bottoms for her father Nicole, who is a refined Gold Digger out for a solution to her's and her father's (the eternally perplexed  Edward Everett Horton in another great performance), money troubles finds herself with an ardent suitor in the wealthy American who initially hides the fact from her that he has been married seven times before! After this startling piece of information is revealed to her at the engagement party photographic session Nicole decides to play the same game herself and promises to marry Michael only if considering his track record, he will give her a large sum of money in the divorce settlement. After the marriage takes place Nicole attempts by living a seperate life and refusing the playboy's romantic advances (in one very funny scene by chewing on some onion sticks over his shoulder just before he kisses her!)to prod him into a divorce which he finally agrees to after a mental breakdown. By this time Nicole has her own money and begins to see that Michael is actuallly the man for her and attempts to win him back through staging scenes to provoke his jealousy till the romantic conclusion when all is settled.Romantic sophisticated comedy it certainly is with just an edge of malice thrown in, and it makes for some funny hijinks by the cast and an entertaining although not top grade romp that will keep you amused. Much talk has been spent on the correctness of the casting with good reason. Claudette Colbert is her usual  best in this type of a role, even in the scenes where her character is playing around with Michael's mind. She had that way of making marital comedy seem so effortless and her own glamourous Parisian appearance and manner suited her perfectly for roles set in the world of the rich and priveledged. Gary Cooper is the bone of contention for most viewers of this film and certainly he does not look comfortable in the role of the Millionaire playboy who just can't help himself in  marrying too many times. The role definately called for an actor who has a more sophisticated screen persona like Cary Grant. Cooper tries hard and his work with Claudette is the best part of the film but I always think of the better choices that were available at this time to do this role. The supporting cast as in all Lubitsch productions is first rate starting with the befuddled Edward Everett Horton as the roguish and financially strapped  Marquis de Loiselle, Nicole's father who is desperate to get Nicole and Michael married so he can enjoy the rich bounty that would flow from such a marriage. His scenes of trying to pass off a questionable ""antique"" bath tub supposedly belonging to Louis Fourteenth to Micheal is most amusing and Horton's famed double takes are much in evidence here in this story. A young David Niven in one of his earliest roles plays Albert De Regniera, a friend of Nicole's who is equally short of money and is mistaken by Michael as an unwelcome suitor in one of the climatic scenes towards the end of the film where he scores a punch to the jaw from Nicole to raise Michael's jealousy of her other ""suitors"".""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", is a pleasant way to pass an hour and a half dallying with the problems of beautiful, wealthy people and those who wish to be that way by hook or by crook. A lesser effort by Lubitsch certainly but lesser for him is still enjoyable. Despite the miscasting of Gary Cooper in the urbane type of role that was not really his speciality, any film with Claudette Colbert is worth a look and her comedy playing in ""Bluebeard"", tends to mask some of the lack of confidence in Cooper's playing. For a journey back to 1930's sophistication and marital goings on, ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", is an enjoyable minor comedy to have a laugh with.",Bluebeard's Eighth Wife VHS

Reeves is a somewhat limited actor who can be good in the right role, but this isn't it. Constantine's acid cynicism is simply beyond Reeves's range. Since Reeves obviously isn't up to the task of Constantine's British accent, Constantine has been arbitrarily transformed into an American. Presumably, the studio was hoping to lure Matrix fans by casting Reeves. They would have been better advised to trust the material and find an actor such as James Marsters who could do the character properly, cynicism, accent, and all. Fans of the Constantine Hellblazer stories will probably be most disappointed.

It is watchable, just not something overly replayable. In a year or two I might be willing to catch in on TV or rent it again, but I still don't want to own it. I like ""Kung Pow!

753504,"I don't think this PPV deserves the hype that it has been receiving, but for what it's worth, it's wasn't that bad. It was one of those experimental ppv's. What I mean by that is tha WWE put in some new faces and new storylines to see if they work.In some areas they did well in some areas but failed in others.The good matches on the card was Brock Lesnar vs John Cena. I have always been impressed with Cena's wrestling ability and I'm glad to see him get a push even if the gimmick's a little lame. The match wasn't quite as good as the Angle/Lesnar match at WrestleMania but they still worked well together. Kane/RVD vs The Dudleys was a good match as well and with Cheif Morley as the special guest referee made it more entertaining to watch. Morley tried to screw RVD and Kane but it backfired and even got the 3-D from the Dudleys for his troubles. Bubba Ray received a chokeslam and the 5 star frog splash after the 3-D. The six man tag was decent. Everyone did get some quality wrestling time in the match. Nash looked like he has cleared up some ring rust and Flair put up a decent performance for someone who hasn't competed in a ppv since October. But the match could've been better. Los Guerreros vs Team Angle wasn't that great of a match but on an entertainment value, it was good. Guerreros lived up to their family motto and that is lying, cheating, and stealing as they making more illegal tags than I could keep count. Team Angle won when Haas pinned Chavo and Benjamin held on to his legs. Team Angle came out to a portrait of Kurt with gold medals in honor of Kurt during his neck surgery. As they were celebrating, Guerreros attacked them and stole the tag team titles and the antics afterwards was hilarous! The rest of the card was not that good! However, Goldberg made a decent return in his match against the Rock but it was way overhyped!",N/A

414675,"Meatballs is the sincere story of a group of plucky, rebellious ""Counselors in Training"" (or CITs, as they are known) at Camp North Star who live and learn, and learn to live with each other and the Head Counselor known as ""Tripper"".  Unfortunately for them, ""Tripper"" is played by Bill Murray in his first starring role and he dominates the picture from the get-go.For those who didn't grow up watching this film, it can be broken down into two equations;Murray = FunnyNo Murray = Not So FunnyMurray is turned loose in several scenes, such as the campfire story, the ""wrestling"" with Roxanne, and most insanely the ""It Just Doesn't Matter"" speech.  To the point were you can see other actors crack up when Murray takes off. He simply takes the reigns of the movie and makes it a classic.The CITs who are the ""heart"" of the film are a likable lot, though none of them really stands out. They spend little time with the kiddies it seems and lots of time horsing around, so it must be a great life they have.Chris Makepeace is a real find as he's sympathetic without a trace of cuteness, which I thought was impossible for any young actor who's name is not Ron Howard.  He went on to star in ""My Bodyguard"".As for the ""Special Edition"" of the DVD itself, I was disappointed.  The movie is presented in faux-widescreen, which is to say full screen with the top & bottom chopped off with a black band to give the illusion of widescreen.  And the transfer itself is not half as good as the version I DVRed' on Showtime recently.  And the audio commentary by director Ivan Reitman & screenwriter Daneil Goldberg is pretty bad when they go off-track and can't remember simple details.  But the three documentary shorts are informative and well made.  While I expected Bill Murray to pass, it was nice to see ""Roxanne"" (Kelly Lynch), ""Spaz"" (Jack Blum), ""Fink"" (Keith Knight), & ""Rudy"" (Chris Makepeace) talk about the film.I dock this classic one star for the poor presentation and another star for the faux-widescreen of the film.  Given that, I expect the ""30th Anniversary Edition"" (no doubt set for 2009) to be superior in every way, too bad we have to wait a while for it.Tidbits:- The comic Chris Makepeace is reading when Tripper prepares for the overnight is the Marvel Two-In-One #50: Thing vs. Thing.  I know, I used to own it.- I understand where the nickname ""Hardware"" comes from, but what about ""Wheels""? And speaking of ""Wheels"", he's played by Todd Hoffman, the younger bother of Dustin Hoffman.- When Tripper burps out, ""Oh, really...really"" and puts his hand to his face, it's an homage to Jack Benny.- During the basketball game ""Fink"" takes a basketball to the back of his head and drops something which remains on the court.  Can't be a cell phone, probably a candy bar.- Tripper & Roxanne singing in the canoe is taken straight from a scene in the Marx Brothers' ""Horsefeathers"", although the song they sing is different.- Other than the CITs, we see three male counselors, but where are the female counselors?",N/A
304468,"This was the most unique PPV event that the WWF had put out at this point as the WWE has never had an event under circumstances like this again such as this being the only time that a PPV event (not UK only PPV) was held in the United Kingdom, the third largest crowd in WWF history with over 80,000 fans, the fact that the two main events were all babyfaces & no heels but more importantly this was the only time in which the Intercontinental title would be headlining the show on it's own.Legion Of Doom vs Money INC. It's ironic that these were the two top teams in the company at the time but yet this match was not for the tag team titles while we got quite the entrance from Hawk & Animal riding their motorcycles down the ramp. The Road Warriors had the power advantage from the start with various slams resorting Dibiase & IRS to use cheap tactics to get the momentum to switch. From there, they used the tag team strategy of isolating one of the Warriors in their corner before making one mistake that resulted in the hot tag being made for Animal to come in & clean house. This was a solid opening match that played to both teams strengths while this was also the last appearance of the Legion Of Doom in the WWF till early 1997.Nailz vs Virgil. Virgil came out throwing hands but Nailz was just imposing to the point where Virgil's offense wasn't mounting to much. Nothing worth seeing here as it was just a quick squash for Nailz with the bigger focus going towards his feud with the Big Bossman.Shawn Michaels vs Rick Martel. Speaking of unique settings, this was another unique feud as this was a rare heel vs heel match with the focal point of the match being Michaels' valet Sensational Sherri placing a stipulation that neither man could punch the other in the face. Both men traded wrestling holds in the early stances with Michaels getting some momentum on his side with offense like a dropkick with Martel returning the favor as well. Both men teased throwing a punch throughout the contest before tempers got the better of both men with Sherri being a factor as well. This is one of those matches that I am torn on as even though this was entertaining with both men being heels along with the aftermath comedy adding more to the match while the fact that the stipulation took away from what could've been an outstanding contest knowing what both men were made up especially when the match ended when it seemed to pick up.WWF Tag Team Champions The Natural Disasters vs Beverly Brothers. The Disasters had the power advantage & were able to stop the attacks on various occassions which resulted in the Beverlys to stall the outside & regroup. The Beverlys were able to get some momentum on their side by resorting to quick tags & speed to hold off either Typhoon or Earthquake along with double team moves. However the size & strength was able to become a factor in the outcome. This tag match really wasn't much but I'll give it some credit as it was a decent worked match that didn't overstay it's welcome which is more than what I was expecting going into it.Crush vs Repo Man. This was significant for the fact that those who know their wrestling history, these two were former tag team partners in Demolition with Repo Man actually being Smash of the group. Past that, this was similar to the Nailz/Virgil match in which it was a dominate performance by Crush to cool the crowd down for the next match.WWF Champion Randy Savage vs The Ultimate Warrior. The WrestleMania VII rematch here with a couple of twists adding to it as not only were both men babyfaces here but the added story was that Mr. Perfect (Ric Flair's personal executive) had claimed that one of these two men had bought his services. Both men started off with a hand shake that actually resulted into an intense exchange before the match got underway. Warrior had the power right off the bat with Savage changing his strategy of attack by resorting to using his combination of speed & power while coming off the top rope various times. Warrior was able to catch (literally at one point) Savage on a few occassions coming off the top including working over Savage's back with series of back breakers, suplexes & a bear hug while Savage worked on Warrior's neck. The turning point here was the appearances of Ric Flair & Mr. Perfect getting involved in the match with a steel chair being used as we saw what their REAL purpose was all along resulting in a finish that neither man wanted but lead to a show of respect between Savage & Warrior. Savage was the perfect opponent for Warrior as this didn't top their WrestleMania match but definitely was one of both men's best matches in their careers as they worked well together.The Undertaker vs Kamala. Speaking of entrances, Undertaker came out to the ring in a hearse with Paul Bearer leading the way. Taker was dominate from the get go bringing the fight to Kamala with a series of chops & clothesline while also pulling off what we know now as ""old school'. Kamala was able to get some offense in based off distractions from Kimchee & Harvey Wippleman before Taker was able to get a hold of them as well till the finish where the phrase ""you won the battle but not the war"" was the intention of Kamala only for Taker to win the psychological war. This was a short & sweet match but was more of a teaser to continue this feud leading to the first ever coffin match.Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart vs The British Bulldog. Bulldog came out to the ring with IBF Continental Boxing Champion Lennox Lewis carrying the Union Jack to the ring with the added drama being that Diana Hart (Bret's sister & Bulldog's wife) was at ringside. Both men started shoving early before Bulldog resorted his power by knocking Bret not only out of the ring but off the platform almost into the fans. From there, both men went hold for hold with a series of armbars & headlocks with a counter for a counter before Bret was able to stay on step ahead of Bulldog with one moment to point in Bret's crossbody not going as planned resulting in Bret almost blowing out his knee before grabbing a reverse bulldog headlock on the way down. Bret switched tactics by going from the head to the back to wear Bulldog out with sleeper holds, back breaker, side russian legsweep & even countering Bulldog's crucifix into a fallaway slam. Bulldog was able to gain momentum back with his power & delivering offense of his own such as a gorilla press, a suplex off the top rope & even his own running power slam. Both men started to feel the effects of the match as it were on as they kept kicking out from various moves such as a german suplex to Bret even pulling out a sharpshooter to no effect before it was one counter hold that gave the fans what they wanted in their hero's dream coming true. Even though this match had a few blown spots that Bret even acknowledged in his DVD set, this was a historic match as both men put on a wrestling clinic to the point where Vince McMahon pointed out ""we have seen every wrestling move"" with the aftermath of all three embracing with the crowd cheering non stop being quite the site to see. This was the match of the night for me as well as a highlight match for BOTH men.Overall, this wasn't the best SummerSlam from start to finish but there were various highlights such as the setting being very unique along with the two title matches being the highlights while some matches were solid to just short squash matches so for a good price, I'd recommend but if not I'd get the SummerSlam Volume One set as you get this event along with four other events.",N/A

639650,"Based on the best-selling novel that took the world by storm, the film version of The Da Vinci Code, directed by Ron Howard, has been eagerly anticipated by fans ever since the book hit the shelves in 2003. When Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a world renowned symbologist, is brought in to help investigate a bizzare murder he meets cryptographer Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou). When she tells him that he has become a suspect in the murder, they quickly gather up the clues from the crime scene and try to escape. This results in the two being chased first by the police and then by assassins in the employ of Opus Dei as they continue to uncover a conspiracy that the Vatican wishes to remain a mystery. The film moves at a brisk pace, with twists and turns abound along with plenty of revelations for conspiracy theorists to revel in. However, the movie seems to drag on due to Howard's urge to cram every bit of information possible into the massive 149 minute runtime. It also doesn't help that the surprises, though fun, are fairly predictable. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that the characters, no matter how much backstory they are given, seem like nothing more than vehicles to push the plot forward; even Paul Bettany's albino monk assassin, Silas, a character with obvious cinematic potential, feels sterile. These weaknesses can result in some scenes feeling a little flat where any one of those missing elements could have bolstered such moments admirably. The film isn't all bad but the negatives, unfortunately, weigh in almost even with the postives. Had Akiva Goldsman been able to infuse the characters with some humanity and a few scenes been left on the cutting room floor, The Da Vinci Code would have been the lean and exciting thriller that fans had been expecting.",N/A

1094028,"Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have had success with such collaborations as 'The Chronicles of Narnia' and 'The Life and Death of Peter Sellers', proving their skills, and yet in this strange amalgam of serious versus romantic versus dark comedy they have created a series of vignettes loosely tied together and named it YOU KILL ME.  The film as directed by John Dahl (aided by a superb cluster of fine actors) almost works despite itself, but in the end the audience is left wondering just what the purpose of the fragmented nature of the story was!The story begins in Buffalo, NY where the Irish gang is coercing the Chinese gang to join forces against the rapidly diminishing Polish gang. The head man for the Polish is Roman Krzeminski (Philip Baker Hall) aided by Stef Czyprynski (Marcus Thomas) both of whom rely on their hit man Frank Falenczyk (Ben Kingsley) - an aging alcoholic who lately has had too many missed or messy deaths because of his constant state of inebriation. Roman feels the pinch as Irish gang leader Edward O'Leary (Dennis Farina) escapes being snuffed by Frank, and Frank is sent to San Francisco to dry out and shape up.  In San Francisco, Frank is monitored by Dave (Bill Pullman) who finds Frank a job in a funeral home making up corpses and forces Frank into AA meetings. Gradually Frank gets sober, only to meet a woman Laurel (T&eacute;a Leoni) who is also a bit beaten by her own demons.  They form a fragile and odd relationship, each for some reason feeling the need to mutually open up - a new experience for both. Frank's AA sponsor Tom (Luke Wilson) adds to the growing away from alcohol process and also aids Frank in his attraction to Laurel. Lapses into booze occur and Frank finally feels he is a failure and returns to Buffalo to resume his 'work', but to his surprise, the changes that occurred in San Francisco follow him - in a good way.Even with the Cuisinart-blended fragments of a story, the cast is so strong that the film works.  Kingsley is convincing, Leoni is superb, and the rest of the ensemble rises to the occasion with the little screen time they are given.  And while the movie feels like a spoof on AA meetings and a spoof on organized crime and on funeral parlor secrets, in the end it seems like a fairly solid love story - albeit a weird one.  YOU KILL ME is an acquired taste.  Grady Harp, September 07",You Kill Me
786470,"""Cabin Fever"" attempts to pay homage to the classics in a genre that has been collecting dust since the 80's, and succeeds in delivering a few jolts in the process. The story is well conceived, though the direction and especially the writing fails to make this movie stand out as anything other than a campy party movie that will gross out the more squeamish viewers. Read on, if you're interested...The story begins like so many ""Friday the 13th"" movies have, with 5 college students decide to head up into the woods to celebrate the end of their finals by spending a week at a secluded cabin. The 5 kids are right out of the horror-clich&eacute; handbook: The horny couple, the token stoner/misfit, and the painfully nice guy who wants nothing more than to get into a relationship with his frosty-box platonic girl friend. Before heading to the cabin, they are given the ominous warning to ""Stay out of the woods"", and as you might expect, they don't listen. One night they are paid a visit by a seriously sick and demented hermit, who appears to be carrying some sort of disease. The hermit dies in the lake, and infects their water supply, which spreads a parasite that causes the body to melt and break apart in the most gruesome fashion. What happens next is better seen than described, but gore-hounds will definitely be pleased.The cast and crew are composed mainly of unknowns. Director Eli Roth is obviously on his first feature, and pulling out all the stops (assuming he might never get the chance again). Even by horror standards, the script is bad, making the characters as one-dimensional as possible. The one-liners, f-words, and obligatory sexual innuendos are a staple of the genre, and are given in mass quantity here, making the movie unintentionally funny at times. The acting is as inept as can be expected, though Cerena Vincent (best remembered as the perma-nude exchange student from ""Not Another Teen Movie"") stands out, and her scenes do not disappoint. The special effects are the payoff, however, with skin bubbling and melting, blood spewing, and plenty of gruesome dismemberments. The effects are very Tom Savini-inspired, and are very well done.The DVD contains five commentaries (!), which is hefty considering that the movie hardly warrants a second viewing, let alone five. I haven't touched them, but the ""Beneath The Skin"" documentary (30 minutes) is fun to watch, consisting of interviews with the main cast and crew, while splicing in behind the scenes shots, including many of the effects pieces. What makes is fun is that nobody involved seems to take the movie too seriously, and obviously approached it as more of a fun project. The other extras are jokes, consisting of the 1 minute ""Family Version"", the movie shot in ""Chick Vision"", which cuts out all the jump scenes and gore shots for the sensitive girls watching, and the hilarious ""Rotten Fruit"" segments, which further displays Director Roth's obsession with rotting and decaying things. The sheer quantity of extras will keep you busy for almost 10 hours, though you have to wonder if a movie like this warrants that investment in time.""Cabin Fever"" is gory and occasionally goofy, which made it a fun movie to watch the first time around, but with the shock value worn off, it is hard to find a reason to watch it again. It is average in every sense of the word, and is not likely to stand up to other time-honored horror classics. My recommendation is marginal.",Cabin Fever

288862,"While I appreciate the merits of the 1939 original of ""The Women,"" not a camp follower. It seems to me that if a story has the interest of this one, there's room for updated versions (not reinventions).  There are some successful remakes out there; best to remain open.  That being said, unfortunately the 2008 remake was ridiculous.  It ran more like ""The Group"" and was quite offensive.  They seemed to think degeneracy would bring it up to date.As promising as this subject film was, it doesn't survive either as a remake or as a film.  Its promise comes with basically same script, good cast, overall effective casting and the addition of color.  It's demise comes in the execution, mostly with uneven flow, lack of timing with flat and ineffective dialog - the basics of a relational film. For one example, the scene with Kay and Crystal in the dressing room could have come from a high school play reading.  Where was the director to say ""cut"" and sitting the two down and explaining what is needed here, like, this time with feeeeling.  However, this is an experienced director as are the actresses. Maybe some higher ups in the production are the ones responsible (by being irresponsible). The whole movie comes across like a radio that's off station, not quite into the static, but off enough to be irritating.  Yes, there are good segments (most critical and consumer reviewers commend Dolores Gray), but the overall disconnects in essentials are ruinous. It's a shame, and I really wanted to like it.Was there a lot of tension or conflict on the set?  There was definitely a spoiler in the execution of this. Something choked it off and, again, it's a shame.  Maybe they tried too hard, overloading it with too many features and just couldn't keep all the plates up at the same time.  That's a circus, not a movie.  Perhaps the extras such as the musical numbers, fashion focus and the like drew off resources that should have been spent on what is essential to a film like this - the portrayals. That would explain the uneven flow, lack of timing, rushed quality and false notes in much of the dialog.  The source material is all about relationships.  It was said of the producer/director of a successful epic that he didn't let the spectacle override or get in the way of the human drama.  He was a stronger hand than whoever called the shots here.  If you can handle that with a massive production, it should be possible to handle it with a picture like this.  Whoever is responsible, they loaded it up with extras, not bad in themselves, but flat couldn't pull it off, and it's too darn bad.It turns out that the enthusiasts of ""The Women"" (1939) are vindicated in their dire predictions about attempting remakes.  With the subject film, it's not so much that it's a failed remake; it's that it's a failed movie.  At least they changed the title.",N/A

Plus, it's got two discs to watch - albeit, not terrific extras, but still, cheap is cheap!As well as Ben & Gwyn, this has a great supporting cast, well, apart from Alex D. Linz, who is as big a brat in this as he is in Home Alone 22. The rest of the supporting cast are great: a strange looking Jennifer Grey, Joe Morton, the 'bad' guy from Ghost, and probably many other faces that I don't recognise, but you will. I felt Jennifer Grey's role kinda got pushed to one side, even though it was an important storyline.When the film started, it came across as very much a Final Destination storyline. With the plane and everything. To be honest, the film kinda dragged in the scenes between the plane crashing, and Ben meeting Gwyn. (By the way, who calls their child BUDDY?!)As with all rom-coms, this was very predictable - it just took a while for Benny to get round to telling Gwynnie that he knew her now deceased hubby. You keep rooting for him to tell her, knowing exactly what her reaction was gonna be.I didn't think Ben & Gwyn were exactly miscast in this movie - but it didn't last between them.

But it wasn't the indie masterpiece it was touted as being,  either.I think that to love a movie like this,  you had to care about the characters,  but I'm afraid I didn't.  Even when Ashley tragically lost the ""Junebug"" the movie is named for,  all I could think was,  ""Well,  maybe next time you'll let them put you on the fetal monitor,  dumbass.""  The artist that Madeline just had to have was the most offensive character I've seen recently,  both in speech and in his ""art"",  and I wasn't at all sure why she wanted to represent him so badly.  Maybe I'm just too unsophisticated,  but I couldn't see anything the least appealing about his paintings,  and ultimately,  aside from the talent of the actors,  I couldn't see much appealing about this movie either.",Junebug
48101,"Unlike ""The Right Stuff,"" the brilliant film on the Mercury space program that focuses more on character profiles and symbolism than factual history, ""Apollo 13"" is an entertaining space film that can be used by high school and junior high history teachers. This is due to director Ron Howard and his crew's painstaking recreation of the Apollo space program -- from using a weightless environment to borrowing large chunks of mission control transcripts. The recreations are so dead-on that astronauts and mission control members report having forgotten they were on a set, or confusing the digital imitations for the real thing.Where Howard's dazzling special effects and technical accuracy leave off, his cast takes over. Tom Hanks' enthusiasm for the subject matter shows as Commander Jim Lovell. He skillfully portrays both the excitement of going into space and the stoicism with which the astronauts approached their dangerous work. Bill Paxton as Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, Kevin Bacon as Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert and Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife Marilyn also shine, but it is masters of subtlety Ed Harris as flight director Gene Kranz and Gary Sinise as grounded astronaut Ken Mattingly who steal every scene. They are given ample opportunity to do so, thanks to the wise decision to focus as much on the heroism on the ground from geeks with pocket protectors as the heroism in space from the astronauts.The only problem is the film's occasional ham-handedness, most noticably in its attempts to place the mission in a historical context. Where Hanks, Howard and producer Brian Grazer's miniseries ""From the Earth to the Moon"" (in the segment ""1968"") deftly underscored the turbulence of the late 1960s and early 1970s, this film makes offhand references through the eldest Lovell daughter to the Hippie Movement and the Beatles breaking up, which comes off as crass and afterthought-like.Still, the film is alternately suspenseful and meticulous in most of the right places, and is therefore valuable both as a movie and as a historical record.The DVD was made when studios were only beginning to play with the medium, and while the ""Apollo 13"" DVD was an early groundbreaker, the awkwardness shows. An hour-long documentary and two commentary tracks -- one from Howard, one from the real-life Jim and Marilyn Lovell -- together provide a glimpse into both the historical facts and the filmmaking tricks (although screenwriters William Broyles, Jr. and Al Reinert are entirely ignored). But the extras mostly stop there. There is a trailer and production and cast and crew notes, and the menu is a CD for the film score soundtrack, albeit a CD which cannot be paused and in which you can skip FORWARD but not BACKWARDS. Yet the DVD is a far cry from the Special Editions of today. There are no NASA documentaries, for instance, and very little original documentary footage.While it seems possible, perhaps likely, that Universal could eventually release an even more loaded DVD release, the current one is more than adequate for educational and entertainment purposes.",N/A
301097,"I liked this movie a great deal.  It was a very entertaining movie, with a story more than decent enough for a swashbuckler movie, great production values, and plenty of action.  Of course, it's not without its flaws.  Costner is simply badly miscast.  I say that not because of his American accent, which is really a very minor blemish on the film, but because he plays basically the same character in every film -- a quiet, contemplative, angst-ridden nice guy.  This is really not the ideal characterization for a swashbuckling hero (though it would have been appropriate for a character study movie such as Sean Connery's ""Robin and Marian"" -- however that role was filled to perfection by Connery).  Costner never would have gotten the part had he not been riding high from the success of ""Dances with Wolves"" at the time, and thus been able to write his own ticket.  This is yet another film in movie history where a part was badly miscast because the producers wanted to get the hottest current name on the theater marquees.  I'll also never understand all the acclaim Alan Rickman got for his portrayal of the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Rickman was brilliant in ""Die Hard"", but his portrayal of the Sheriff is so outrageous that it descends into the realm of caricature.  It makes the Sheriff amusing, which he should never be.  Also marring the film are some historical howlers.  The ""Celts"" that the Sheriff hires to attack Robin and his outlaws are presumably referred to by that name in order to try to make them generic, and thus avoid offending the Irish, Scots, and Welsh by characterizing them explicitly as barking savages.  But not only would any of these Celtic peoples have been referred to as Irish, Scots or Welsh by the English at this time, they would have looked and acted nothing like the stereotypical, fur-clad barbarians seen here.  But the movie was still good, and plenty of fun.I also feel I must correct a point another reviewer raised about King John.  Not only does the movie not suffer for lack of him as a villain (John was hardly the only brutal, villainous man in England, so other noblemen can fill that role more than adequately), but John, while far from a good king, has gotten a worse rap than he really deserves in some respects -- especially in comparison to his older brother Richard the Lionhearted.  In fact Richard was at least as bad as John was for squeezing the people for tax money.  He bled England white in order to pay for his military adventures in the Holy Land and in France, and spent only six months of a ten year reign in England.  John, though undeniably treacherous, vengeful, and suspicious to the point of near paranoia, at least stayed in England and tried to govern it.  His efforts, while not all that successful, were not entirely incompetent either.  Where Richard cared not a whit for England except for how much money he could wring out of it, John took a personal interest in the judicial and financial administration of the country, and he  can claim some responsibility for advances at the Exchequer, in the administration of justice, in methods of taxation and military organization, and in the grant of chartered privileges to towns.  His political judgement was actually not at all bad; it was his hot-tempered, treacherous, and vindictive character that led him to tread on the rights of his barons, and  overreach his authority on occasion, thus earning him his bad name.  And his conspicuous lack of military success throughout most of his reign (in an era when the warrior king was the ideal, and battlefield successes could trump many other faults) led his contemporaries and successors not to overlook these flaws, as they did sometimes in other, more militarily successful bad rulers.",Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves VHS
908538,"I rented this because I really liked the first in this unrelated ""series"", Whispering Corridors. This 3rd movie has come a long way visually and with budget. It scared the HELL out of me visually at times. Unfortunately it also confused me. I wasn't expecting flashbacks and sequences that you had no way to be sure if they were real or not, and the plot just wasn't strong.Two friends at a girl's school in Seoul take ballet class in school. It came naturally for So-hee, but Jin-sung has to work very hard to be good and the teacher reminded her. So-hee had been sitting out injured w/ wraps to heal. As things move along, we see that So-hee is an adorable, vibrant personality that does things spontaneously, like sneaking out to a concert or into the school dorm to talk to Jin-sung late at night. One night she says she only does ballet because her mother forces her and she'd rather quit. Then she says that it makes her feel alive. Before she leaves she tells Jin-sung that in 10 years they'll be performing in London, her as Giselle (the lead) and Jin as some other character and leaves. So-hee is also pretty insensitive, clueless, and self-preoccupied. Around this time, the fat, crazy girl in the school with orange hair has been wandering around- being weird. The ""wishing stairs"" are mentioned and explained in the beginning, and her fascination. One day- she appears to have lost weight, but she still acts and walks awkwardly- she tells Jin-sung what happened. In the meantime, it has been announced that there will be an audition and the best goes to a competition where the winner goes to ballet school in Russia. No one is excited because So-hee takes off her wraps and dances like she was never injured- which inspires gossip. Jin-sung overhears So-hee getting pointers on her dance,etc. -So-hee is so self-centered you really want Jin-sung to win!!Jin goes to the stais, makes a wish to go to the competition -totally innocent. The next day she breaks a glass in the locker room and switches toe shoes- she comes out ans as Soo-hee dances, her foot starts to bleed badly. Ignoring it, she finishes perfectly and no one mentions it. After that Jin doesn't even want to talk to So-hee who keeps bugging her. Things come to a head on a staircase where Jin tells her she hates her and So-hee, used to getting everything she wants, grabs her. Jin tries to get loose and Soo-hee falls down the stairs. Jin wins the competition in So-hee's place and we see her go to the hospital. So-hee looks fine and is wheeling around in a wheel-chair. Next day- news that she's dead(?!?!?) and everyone is mad at Jin. That's when the crazy girl mourns the loss of her secret idol by asking the stairs to bring her back to her. That's when the hauntings and possessions begin. The scene of So-hee as a dead girl in her costume following Jin and dancing was terrifying! 5 stars to that, but other things were just too confusing and not explained after that. At the beginning and that one point, it IS the movie described on the box, before it shatters into confusion again.This is the third movie in the Whispering Corriders series.",Wishing Stairs

This series features a capable cast--the *lovely* Collette Stevenson in particular--and some beautiful scenery (the show was filmed in New Zealand).

637830,"A lot of people tend to say one thing about Hollywood remakes: why? What for? When you have an original that's easily a classic, there almost seems little point to revisit. Peter Jackson said King Kong was his inspiration to be a filmmaker so maybe it's a case of the student trying to become the teacher? A way of saying ""thanks""? An update? I don't know but as it stands the film is pretty good entertainment with large amount of flaws all over the place.You all know the story but I must repeat it. Carl Denham is a filmmaker who is not delivering on his films. He decides to get out quickly on a filmmaking chance of a lifetime but he needs an actress. He finds Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudeville actress. Bringing her in, they head toward the mysterious Skull Island where more than just locals roam.Officially the film won for Best Visual Effects which personally I don't understand. There's obvious CG shots all over the place including some much needed redos on compositing. In New York at the end it's absolutely beautiful on top of the Empire State Building but on Skull Island it's almost cringe-inducing at parts. Not to mention the sounds outside of Kong are merely ok but go figure, they won Best Sound and Sound Editing. T-Rex's don't sound big enough personally.The other flaw is the action sequences. Yes they're cool and yes they're exciting but they're also incredibly silly. When you got guys running from a herd of brontosaurs and only 4 or so get trampled in such a narrow space is hard to believe. Not to mention when they topple over. Then there's Kong fighting no less than 3 V-Rexes(apparently they're not T ones they're V) with only bites doesn't add up. No big chunk missing or torn flesh, it's merely teeth marks and blood. It might sound like I'm nitpicking but when you want people to believe in such an extravagant world it helps to nail reality's details, even if it does have large spiders and a gorilla.One more nitpick: its editing and length. Much of this film could've been chopped off. Spielberg even when making the 2 1/2 hour Close Encounters or 3+ hour Schindler's List, never made a boring film(some exceptions may apply). Jackson on the other hand might need to fire his editor since so much is rather unneccessary. It's as if the only way to make the film epic is to pack it with as much as you can. Subplots and sidestories(such as a cabin boy and a father-like figure) are never resolved.Where the film works is the acting, despite its odd casting choices. Jack Black makes a good Denham but not an excellent one and Adrien Brody doesn't scream action hero to me. The supporting cast is good though with the under-utilized Colin Hanks(bit of a slip when I mentioned Tom instead). Naomi Watts is the perfect Ann Darrow though, tough and very emotional. In fact, it's probably rare to not find her teary eyed in the film, and quite a set of lungs. Her screams people although the other thing...It's one of the most biggest and expensive movies ever yet I feel it's not an A picture but it's not a so bad it's good B picture. It's like a B+, entertaining but so much problems it has.",King Kong

398407,"Bear Island is one of those movies I want to like more for all its cheesiness. Barely released theatrically, cut heavily for home video and rarely shown on TV, it marked the end of the big screen Alistair MacLean goldmine (subsequent adaptations would be straight to cable) and, pretty much, the viability of most of the cast as leading players - Donald Sutherland, Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Widmark in particular would soon be relegated to the little leagues or supporting roles. At times it's like a bad accent competition, with Richard Widmark's German and Christopher Lee's Polish faring better than Vanessa Redgrave's Norwegian (""Yuust becorzz somwun haas givan anne ohrdoor?"") which at least adds a little variety to her usual flat delivery of dialog. Maybe Donald Sutherland should have tried one too because he spends huge chunks of the movie sounding bored stiff, not helped by being required to play one scene in red longjohns and trapper's cap.There's nothing new here: multinational UN climate change expedition to the Arctic is beset by mysterious deaths and accidents related to a fortune in Nazi gold in the ruins of a nearby U-boat pen, with all the predictable plot turns. This being Alistair MacLean, no-one is what they claim to be, and this being an adaptation of a novel virtually nothing bears any resemblance to what was on the printed page (much of which took place on the voyage to the island). Aside from one good `accidental' poisoning sequence the book was hardly one of MacLean's best efforts, so that's no great loss. It has its moments if you're in an undemanding mood - there's a memorably atmospheric shot of the ship passing the clifftop graveyard of German U-boat crews, while the U-boat pen set is genuinely impressive - and it's well photographed on some striking remote locations, but it's more filler than main course.",N/A

Did it make them young to bring new blood into the house? And if the Rolf family was brought to the house as sacrifices, why isn't Karen Black's picture on the table of victims at the end?  And what happens to her exactly after her family is dead? Is she the new Mrs. Alerdyce and if so, what happened to the first Mrs. A?

Despite this being a drama versus a comedy, I didn't see an imprint of Woody's style in this film in any way shape or form.  Was it really directed by Woody Allen?  I had to check the DVD cover to be sure.I did like the idea of the ""matchpoint"", explained via narration in the begining of the film and the scene of the tennis ball striking the top of the net with the potential to fall on either side.  Woody Allen explored the concept of how fortune and luck played a bigger role in people's lives more than they claimed it did.  In the case of the main character Chris, fortune very quickly was falling out of favor with him.  Was he man enough to withstand the consequences or would he force fate his way?Worth a watch but disappointinlgy mainstream.",Match Point
1152389,"I'm a weather junkie. Short of a meteorology degree, I know a lot about supercell activity and tornado formation. This stuff is very interesting and I've always wanted to see a tornado in person, but I live in the wrong part of the country. In another life, perhaps.The point is; storm chasing is incredibly exciting. It's a visceral experience unlike anything else, and for some reason the people in this documentary just seem too cautious/unenthusiastic about the whole thing. It's off-putting. You can get better, more exciting footage of tornadoes by opening the outbreak segments of Wikipedia, looking at the lists and classifications of the known tornadoes from a particular outbreak, and scanning Youtube for the corresponding tornado with (mostly) amateur footage of the storms.I mean, this guy Josh relies way too much on his computer models, and the irony is that within the very show he is shown to be wrong/having miscalculated numerous times. All the while, the rest of the team is viewing the actual weather with their eyes, and this meteorologist is contradicting them with computer models that ended up being wrong more than they're right. It's frustrating to watch, instead of fun. The culmination is when Josh, our buddy the ""always wrong overly cautious"" leader, improperly predicts storm formation to eastern Kansas, while Sean, the intuitive ""photographer"" storm chaser accurately calls development to the south. That development resulted in one of the worst tornadoes in history, the Greensburg tornado. Obviously storm chasing isn't an exact science and mistakes are a given, but this guy makes so many mistakes throughout some of the episodes that it kind of hampers the enjoyment of it. Ultimately, the stormchasers that rely a bit more on intuition and experience are much more engaging to watch and because the leader of this series is a cautious, conservative ""radar watcher,"" the show suffers from it and is less interesting than it should be.To be honest, as annoying as he is, I actually prefer the videos Reed Timmer makes. He's a lot younger, more enthusiastic and focused, and more willing to take the risks which often result in larger payoffs/better footage. I'm not saying with something like storm chasing that being a wild card is better, but I get the impression in this series that the chasers here are just a little too cautious and a little too focused on their instrumentation rather than the epic views of the vicious weather all around them.The show is not bad, but it could (and should) be much better.",Storm Chasers/Perfect Disaster
520206,"Every dime they've spent on this trilogy is on the screen. Whether it's set design, costumes, make-up or digital wizardry - even the acting - they've gotten the biggest possible bang for every buck. The movie is a continuous visual feast from beginning to end. It's just that by the time the last course comes out, you've been sitting back from the table with your hands folded across your chest for almost an hour. And, since the final installment won't be out until Christmas 2003, you know there won't be a dessert.The creators' devotion to the events in the source material is admirable but also a limitation. Tolkien often substituted internal back-story and characterization for plot development and this is glaringly evident on film. The plot breaks down into a three hour chase sequence that feels uncomfortably repetitive.If you don't know where the first book ends, you'll be treated to a least a half dozen false endings that utilize every visual and musical cue to indicate the credits are about to roll...then cut to more dialogue. Every third person in the theater looked at their watch when this happened. I didn't realize so many folks had day-glow watches these days.I am not saying the movie is a waste of time. The elements that make the Rings trilogy great - Tolkien's imagination and love of detail and his depiction of the individual's potential for good and evil - are evident.

While at its core, Basic is your run-of-the-mill murder mystery interlaced with testosterone moments of flying bullets and angry stares, in the end the final product becomes bogged down in its own cleverly laid sandtraps. The screenplay, while sharply written with tight dialogue still fails to deliver the knockout punch. The performances are adequate, with Giovanni Ribisi being the lone sell-out in the cast. While attempting to appear sinister, amoral and just plain confused, he comes off as a pure hack; all menacing sidelong glances, guttural ""I hate Daddy"" speeches while sputtering riddle after incoherent riddle. John Travolta imbues Tom Hardy with the same boyish charm and ornery impetus that had littered every character he has every played, and Sam Jackson is merely adequate.

598139,"This is a film about mother/daughter relationships and about unconditional love. Despite being marked by fine performances, the film never really grabs the viewer, at least, not this viewer. While moderately enjoyable, I found the film to fall a little flat, as the whole Ya-Ya thing left me cold, finding it all a bit silly.Not having read the book of the same name upon which the film is based, I  had no frame of reference. Judging strictly on the merits of the film, I found that it has its ups and downs. The name of the film is apparently derived from a childhood club to which a group of lifelong friends belonged as children in which they were all Ya-Ya priestesses.  These friends, of which Vivi (Ellyn Burstyn) is at the center of this story, are all trying to reconcile Vivi to her daughter Sidda (Sandra Bullock). The friends, as well as Vivi, are all aging southern belles from Louisiana. Sidda, however, has moved North, where she is a budding, successful playwright.Sidda had a traumatic childhood, as her mother is a mercurial woman with a drinking problem. It seems that Vivi never got over losing her childhood sweetheart during the war. She married another man, Shep Walker (James Garner), Sidda's father and a man who has loved Vivi unconditionally throughout their entire married life,  and proceeded to put her husband and her children through a living hell. Still, Vivi and Sidda manage to plod along as so many mothers and daughters do, until Vivi goes too far and Sidda decides that enough is enough.The story of Vivi, Sidda, and Shep is told in flashbacks, which provide the  most interesting parts of the movie. Ashley Judd is simply sensational as the young Vivi, and she outshines all the film and stage veterans in this film, infusing the role with a gritty reality. David Lee Smith is very good as the hunky young Shep, the husband who tries to understand a mercurial wife who has become unbalanced by her longing for what could never be.Ellen Burstyn as the senior Vivi is not as compelling as the younger one portrayed by Ashley Judd. The senior Vivi comes across as a silly, petulant, spoiled, self-absorbed woman who needs a good swift kick in the butt. Consequently, the viewer cares very little for what happens to her, even though she is eventually reconciled to her daughter and comes to appreciate her patient, selfless husband.Maggie Smith, Fionnula Flanagan, and Shirley Knight are all excellent as Vivi's lifelong friends, though Ms. Smith occasionally seems to have a bit of difficulty suppressing her British accent. They inject a touch of humor into their attempts to reconcile the estranged Vivi and Sidda, which is a good counterpoint to the underlying pathos of the film. Sandra Bullock is also excellent as the fed up Sidda, who has said that enough is enough. As in all her film, she charms the viewer. James Garner is wonderful as Vivi's long suffering husband, who comes to be appreciated by Vivi only at the end.Unfortunately, the director appears to have striven for mawkishness. Consequently, the ending of this film is enough to make one gag,  as Sidda is inducted into the Ya-Ya sisterhood. This alone is enough for me to counsel viewers to rent, and not buy, this film.",N/A
545869,"Poor Laurence Fishburne. I felt so sorry for him watching this movie because he gives a passionate and multi-dimensional  performance as  Othello and yet, no one else in the cast matches or even comes close to his level of talent.As the cover photo suggests, this is a more sexualized version of Shakespeare's tragedy, which doesn't make it bad, but definitely steals the focus from the other emotions that fuel the story. All of Othello's feelings were intense, not just those he had for Desdemona, and this fact is overlooked by the emphasis on his sexuality. Kenneth Braunagh is such a bad Iago that I actually found myself laughing at him. As for Irene Jacob's performance, it is really not worth mentioning here. She is pretty and exotic but she gives no depth to the wounded character of Desdemona. I truly wish that this movie could be redone by a different director with a different supporting cast, because it is a fascinating idea that just falls flat.",N/A

187717,"Back when I was in my 20s (a few decades ago), I met a few gals that were like Catherine in Jules and Jim, seriously emotionally underdeveloped.  Fortunately for me, I wasn't attracted to them, the malignancy in their personalities had shown through making it clear to me in advance that something wasn't right.  And arguing that Catherine may have been a little more subtle than those is contradicted by the outcome of the movie.  But the real problem with Jules and Jim is that it just doesn't ""build"" up to it very well.  There's not really a detectable progression, Catherine's character should have been more and more obvious, either through gradual reveal of relevant elements, or by the development of unremarkable characteristics into unusual ones.  While there's the isolated jump-in-the-river instance as a bit of a clue, there's little else that leads to where the movie ends up.  Frankly, it seemed to me a 1960s free-spirit-Antonioni forerunner until the end bent it more toward fatal attraction.By the middle of the movie I just figured Jules and Jim were a bit thick in letting Catherine get away with her shenanigans rather than simply giving her the boot.  None of the characters were very compelling, I was reminded of all the reviews I've read about movies where the reviewer didn't care about any of the characters-- that seemed to sum it up for me until the ending, which finally showed that the plot wasn't supposed to be  (or shouldn't have been, anyway) quite as aimless as it had just appeared.I suspect the movie is underdeveloped because is was done when Truffaut was still pretty young, before he had the experience to understand the emotional and psychological nuances that would have made this movie one heck of a lot better.  Emotional content would really fill out the story here, but as it is, it's a pretty shallow representation.  There's certainly far worse movies, but Jules and Jim is nowhere near as good as The 400 Blows.",N/A

1367196,"I picked up this movie from a Blockbuster store that was going under for a whole $2 on Blu Ray. Honestly, I didn't even know Adrien Brody was in it, but when I saw that he was, that's when I really gave the movie a try. I loved him in The Pianist and in The Jacket. As the movie got underway, I then saw that Forest Whitaker was in the movie as well. It was then that I felt the movie really had some legs to stand on so I was a little excited.I was let down.The performances by Brody and Whitaker are quite good. Brody plays the role of a peaceful, everyday Joe who answers an ad for a controlled experiment with the promised pay day of $14k. Once there, he meets Whitaker's character who is presented to us as a devout Christian. After some prescreening, both of them, along with several others, are selected to take part in the experiment. Once they arrive at the facility, it is explained to them that they will all be divided into 2 groups: one will be prisoners and the others will be guards. There are a few rules given to the guards as soon as they are getting dressed to start the experiment. Whitaker's character is selected to play a guard while Brody's is to play a prisoner.******SPOILERS AHEAD! STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW SPECIFIC DETAILS!******The concept is laid out cut and dry for us and you can almost immediately tell where this is headed. Still, you find yourself wanting to watch. As the movie progresses though, there is a major plot hole that, in itself, almost does the movie in. A character by the name of Benjy is selected as a prisoner. It is later revealed that Benjy is diabetic. He lies on his application for the project by saying that he controls it with diet when he actually has to take insulin injections. On day two of the experiment, he asks for something to help with his blood sugar levels which are getting low. In most cases, a diabetic with low blood sugar could simply have a decent meal and be just fine. However, instead of simply giving him food, the guards ignore his request and leave him in his weakened state. Being from a family of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, I can assure you if Benjy had not gotten something to eat, he would have been in very serious danger of going into a diabetic coma. From the signs he was displaying, it looked as if he was in dire need of something to eat. Yet, he supposedly goes another full day without eating. He is simply shown laying down in his cell the entire time while the rest of the prisoners go off and have their three meals. Not eating for an entire day can be tough on the average person, but for a diabetic it might as well be a death sentence. Any person with diabetes would have surely succumbed and, at the very least, gone into a coma. Some would have probably died. Later in the film, Benjy ends up getting the insulin he brought with him, but was not allowed to take into the experiment. Having not eaten for an extended period of time, no diabetic would then take insulin as it is used to keep blood sugar levels low. Only if Benjy had been eating should he have taken his insulin. Adrien Brody's character is seen later bringing Benjy a single piece of bread which is not nearly enough for a diabetic to survive on. It is this glaring oversight that, for me, discredits the film as far a believability.Another issue, although smaller, is the set itself. All the participants are supposedly housed in a brick building. During the climax of the film, several prisoners are seen running through a hallway and as they push their hands up against a brick wall, you can actually see the wall wobble. I know you have to suspend disbelief when you watch a film, but the mistakes were so obvious they were hard to ignore.Some of the violence feels very contrived. One of the first disagreements between the guards and the prisoners happens when a prisoner accidentally hits a guard in the face with a basketball. Apologies are given immediately. As a way to punish the prisoner for this, he is asked to do 10 pushups. While the prisoner is a little older, ten pushups seems reasonable and actually very light as far as punishment...yet, he still refuses to do it. From there and through the rest of the movie, the punishments escalate.Brody and Whitaker do turn in very good performances which is why I granted the film the rating that I did. Without their star power and talent, the film is pretty much a throwaway. Clifton Collins, Jr, while not as big a star as Brody and Whitaker, did play the role of a member of the Aryan Brotherhood very well and his performance should also be seen as a bright spot.The rest of the performances felt weak to me. I just couldn't buy some of the others guys in the movie at all. I don't know if it was their performance or if Brody and Whitaker simply outshined them to the point where they came across as first time actors.The transfer to Blu Ray was quite good. The sound quality was there and the picture was clear and crisp on my 48"" HD television. The coloring in certain scenes just shined. I wish more films were transferred as well as this one was.Overall, I can see why the film was a direct to video movie. It really is a shame though. Given the two leads, you'd think they would have had someone fact check more on the writing side. It's not often you get two men who both won Academy Awards into a film together. While some might find the film good, I have to say that it is average at best and the only reason to give it a look is because of the performances turned in by its two stars.2.5 / 5",N/A

I am too young to know him. So I basically went to see this film for the couriosity of seeing the all-star cameros, especially Sheryl Crow. The life of Porter was provocative because he was bisexual,and it kind of ruinned his career and relationships. Nothing about the story touched me, except for Ashley Judd's breakthrough performance as an unconditional loving wife. She has never been so good, considered her character aged from 30-60 years old, and died from illness. The moment when she was getting made over in her room by herself, and she suddenly broke down into massive tears, because she realized that she had never been loved whole-heartedly by her husband. That was the scene to remember! I hope she will at least get nominated for an Oscar, because she made me forget about all of her action thrillers in this movie. Kevin Klein was very good, and it's not the first time he played a flaming homo. In and Out was the last time he gone ""pink"". He's character was too selfish and sexually permiscuious for me to like. I preferred him in Life as A House a lot more.

739257,"Did Charlton Heston get blind-sided by Michael Moore?  Yes, but he's definitely old enough and savvy enough to know better.  Did Moore gain entry to the Heston Hollywood mansion using false pretenses?  No, he told the one-time celluloid god of the waters that he was a lifetime, paid-up member of the National Rifle Association, and once inside even showed his membership card.  And, although the average guy in the street might be disarmed by Moore's folksy style and declasse dress code, Heston knew that Moore was a big time media guy (previous film: Roger and Me; book: Stupid White Men).But Heston never misses a chance to spread the Second Amendment gospel.  He just thought he could handle the situation.  There's no fool like an old fool, they say.  To his credit, when he realized that he had fallen into a trap, he moseyed off, putting one gimpy leg carefully in front of the other as he carried a bent back and a 79-year-old frame off camera.Well, was this fair?  Indeed, was the entire film fair?  No, of course not.  This is Michael Moore simultaneously making a buck, building a rep, and working a cause.  The cause is something like 11,000 dead-by-gunshot Americans every year (a pretty good cause), and the target is indeed Charlton Heston, long-time spokesman not only for God, but more significantly, the NRA, and of course gun and ammo manufacturers and sellers.  So at least we can say that Michael Moore was after big game.He mostly bagged them too (and made Dick Clark look heartless), but somehow I didn't gain much satisfaction.  I don't care much for Charlton Heston, either as an actor or a proselytizer, but I am finding, after watching this and Fahrenheit 9/11, that I don't care much for Michael Moore either.  I think all good, right-thinking liberals should continue to play fair even though the opposition might not.  This film preached to the choir and a good time was had by all who agree with Moore's point of view.  The cover on this DVD even quotes Time Magazine as saying the film is ""hilarious.""Somehow though I don't think those on the right thought it was all that funny.  And I wonder if those in the middle were swayed one way or the other.  It is indeed heartbreaking that kids in this country pick up guns and shoot each other, and the fact that they do it much more often per capita than any other country in the First World does indeed call for an explanation.  Ironically, I think Heston actually had the answer.  This is a violent country with a violent history relative to other industrial nations.  Moore and Heston agreed that our history isn't more violent than, say, Germany's, but they got their ideas confused.  In Germany the violence was by the state and its armies and its police.  We have plenty of that as well of course, but in the US we also have a tradition of the handy six-shooter in the holster for a quick draw and a further tradition of celebrating the rugged individual who stands up against the state and anyone wanting to take his arms away.Personally I think there's a lot to be said and not said for both sides in this all too American debate.  The Freudian implication that would-be macho guys need guns symbolically to feel like men is very real.  It was no accident that Heston let slip the ""multi-ethnic"" rationale for explaining all those dead by firearms in the USA, a rationale that is usually interpreted to mean fear of a big black dude breaking into one's home.  Or actually that is often a sort of ""make my day"" fantasy indulged in by some randy militia types as they sip a little Jack Daniels on the front porch swing as they fondle their weapon.Well, what's the answer?  There is no answer.  It is a gradual process from the jungle to civilization, and the US, in this gun-toting regard, is just a little behind the rest of the West.  If Michael Moore wants to focus on some people who really adore their weapons, he should take a trip to Iraq or Afghanistan, or just watch the nightly news.Still this is worth seeing as a kind of Americana snapshot portfolio.  Marilyn Manson proves a fine foil for Charlton Heston, and the Afro-American elementary school principal can be balanced against the poor little black kid who shot the little white girl, who can be contrasted with the members of the NRA who think the black kid should be tried as an adult, who can be contrasted with the kids at Columbine who were just there when it happened.  And the mentality of Moore and his crew in imagining that they won a ""victory"" against K-Mart when it agreed to take the ammo off it shelves can be contrasted with the young dude who was disappointed that he wasn't named a number one collaborating suspect.  (Actually the ammo sales are small potatoes to K-Mart which has big management and bottom-line problems.)But see this to study the techniques used by Moore.

286440,"While not a cinematic masterpiece, ""The Vikings"" does the job.  My only problem is, in typical 50's fashion, it woefully over-simplifies things (""Vikings are simple, happy people who churn beer and flirt with their serving wenches!"") but whatever... it's still fun.  Surprisingly, I first saw this movie when I was about twelve and it's actually a pretty good educational tool -- I learned a little bit about Norse gods (how can you not when they mention ""Odin"" every five minutes), what ""Valhalla"" is, and even a bit about the Vikings and their raiding techniques.The plot: Early in the movie, we see the Vikings pillage an English town (as the Vikings often did, along the English coast).  Their chief, Ragnar, rapes the English queen and impregnates her.  Since the baby (a boy) is illegitimate, the queen hands him over to a monk who will raise the child.  Years later, we catch up with the son (Tony Curtis) who is now a full-grown man.  He was indeed raised by monks but was recently captured while at sea and sold into slavery.  Now, he is a slave of the Vikings.  Erik is noble and proud.  Einar (Kirk Douglas) is the spoiled, arrogant (yet somewhat likeable) son of the Viking chieftain, Ragnar.  Erik and Einar are similar in age and their personalities clash.This group of Vikings soon kidnaps a Welsh princess (Vivian Leigh) in order to ransom her.  However, Einar, having his pick of Viking wenches, is intrigued by princess Morgana's rejection of his advances, not to mention her stunning beauty.  Simultaneously, Eric also falls for her, and she for him, despite their ""class"" differences.HOWEVER, this wouldn't be a fun 50's time-piece without a dramatic twist!  Remember that Eric is no mere slave, he is a prince and, even better, does not know it! (The necklace he wears, given to him by his mother, proves it.) The story picks up from here and I won't ruin the ending but it culminates in the classic line uttered by an anguished Morgana: ""Eric, he's your brother!!""  Enjoy!P.S.

SHREK'S THRILLING TALES includes three cartoon shorts and one of them doesn't even involve anyone from the Shrek universe. The three shorts are:""Night of the Living Carrots"" - This short doesn't feature anyone from the Shrek universe, but instead features the cast of MONSTERS VS. ALIENS. After the heroics in ""Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space"" the Monsters find themselves fighting off a horde of zombie carrots grown from the blood of the now defeated Mutant Pumpkins. The carrots turn anyone and anything they bite into a mindless zombie.

The Three Little Pigs return home after a night at the movies to discover they have a new next door neighbor. The Pig Who Built the Brick House is in a wheel chair with a broken leg and starts spying on their new neighbor. He's sure the neighbor is up to no good and tries to warn his brothers, but they don't believe him.""The Ghost of Lord Farquaad"" - As Shrek and Fiona are preparing to leave on their honeymoon, Fiona is kidnapped and Shrek and Donkey race to save her. They are led to a cemetery and discover that the ghost of Farquaad is behind the plot. He couldn't be a king in life, so he plans to rule the underworld with Fiona at his side as his queen.

However, I've already seen THE GHOST OF LORD FARQUAAD before. It was originally a ride at Universal entitled SHREK 4-D and was later released on DVD as SHREK 3-D. Now it's been re-released here as filler. I wish there was another new Shrek short that was included, but there's not. It's rather disappointing as all of the shorts on SCARED SHREKLESS were entertaining. There are just so many great stories that could be told in a short format. Dreamworks should be pumping them out, but they aren't.There really aren't any extra features on the DVD except for the usual trailers and the promos for several other animated Dreamworks projects (MASTERMIND, HOW TO TRAIN A DRAGON, etc.).Overall, though ""The Pig Who Cried Wolf"" and ""Night of the Living Carrots"" are a blast, SHREK'S THRILLING TALES is a let down because over half of the disc is a re-release of SHREK 3-D, but under a different name.",N/A

We know that Madame Rose's kiddie troupe is getting a bit long in the tooth, but Jennifer Beck as ""Dainty"" June looks fully thirty years old. Cynthia Gibb is a lovely Louise/Gypsy, but Natalie Wood ""aged"" more credibly in the admittedly flawed by classier 1962 theatrical film adaptation.

71534,"One of the oldest filmic clich&eacute;s is that there's nothing sadder than an old boxer, a washed up pug. To that I might state that only an old wrestler is sadder. After all, wrestling is not a true sport- it's a violent theatrical production, and there is not much at stake for the viewers. As for the wrestlers, themselves....that's where this documentary from 2000 comes in. Directed by first time auteur Barry Blaustein it chronicles the re-rise of pro wrestling to prominence in the late 1990s- the era that saw Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and Cactus Jack become celebrities of a greater nature than any of their forebears, like Killer Kowalski, Dusty Rhodes, Bruno Sammartino, or Hulk Hogan.The film starts off as an exploration of the men behind the `names', yet it makes a mistake right off the bat, by billing itself as an expos&eacute; of the sport, a film that `Vince McMahon doesn't want you to see'. McMahon, to those in the know, is the owner of the largest wrestling league in the nation- the WWE, then the WWF, but there's little in the film to suggest that this is a tell-all. There are some wrestlers with gripes, and we see tales of failed lives, and failed wrestling circuits, like the ECW and WCW (long since bought out by the WWE), and McMahon's league certainly has a history of dealing in drugs (steroids, etc.- as the aforementioned Hogan testified against him in a highly publicized trial in the early 90s), as well as being shamefully anti-union, and not caring of its performers (not long after the film's release one of its wrestlers- Owen Hart, of a well-known wrestling clan- was killed in a spectacular fashion while performing, and the film acknowledges that one of its minor characters, Droz, was paralyzed not long after the film was completed), but all of this is public knowledge, and old news.What works, though is the portrait of the biz the film portrays, and the three main wrestlers whose lives it follows.... The film has its moments of poignancy and insight, but they are too few and far between. A more pristine and jaded eye would have been necessary, and a more ballsy approach to the subject matter, to gain a following outside the `choir' of pro wrestling. Still, since I go to those pews, every few years, I think it's a must see for any wrestling fan. The game has changed much during the decades, yet, in a sense, it hasn't changed at all. Whether good or bad is the crux, and what this film passes on.",N/A
276565,"Conventional opinion in the realm of Marx mania targets this movie as inferior. It is ironic that top-of-the-line MGM was partly responsible for diminishing the later Marx magic by teaming silly scripts and moronic musical numbers with the lunacy of the Marx screen persona. This tone-deaf creative acumen relegated Messrs. Marx to lesser material in their last three films at the studio. Take courage; not all is lost. Looking past the annoyances of Kenny Baker's unfortunate singing and the goofy dancing horse number, we can see Marxian mirth in good health. Groucho, without an ID badge, tries to board the circus train guarded by Chico, and we are off to more classic comedy. As Groucho and the guys try to obtain an incriminating cigar from a thieving midget, Marx mayhem prevails. The spirited performance of ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"" is also a definite plus. Harpo struggles, at times, to find something relevant to do. His pantomime antics do not always make sense within the! context of the action. However, Harpo's mischievous elfin qualities sparkle as he and Chico search the sleeping strongman's room for the missing money. Despite a bias against intrusive musical numbers..., Harpo connects with the singing and dancing African-American kids in a way that illustrates that his otherworldy perspective truly transcends mere racial barriers. His harp solo punctuates this segment nicely. Margaret Dumont is again on hand as the hilarious target of Groucho's barbed zingers. Even with its faults, this is an enjoyable Marx Brothers jolt for fans of classic comedy. Fast forwarding through the dull spots makes multiple viewing a treat. ;-)",N/A

1678477,"For those who loved Fast, Faster, Fastest, Long Way Round, Long Way Down etc., this film pretty much falls flat short of being anywhere nearly as good as the above mentioned...  It starts off as a very exciting documentary for motorcycle development & motorcycle racing history in the US.  But, it ultimately fails, because it very quickly turns into a far-fetched infomercial about how motorcycle riding cures cancer, motorcycle riding makes your kids eat their vegetables, and by golly motorcycles actually make criminals into model law-abiding citizens, dog darn it!  (Yah, right.)  Look.  All riders -love- motorcycles for different reasons.  But, please don't insult our intelligence with all the mushy stuff.

957841,"Okay, maybe for those of you who just looked at all the pretty pictures in Ultimates Vol #1 this will in fact be a direct adaptation for you.  However, for those of you who actually read the book, you're probably gonna be a little dissapointed.  Read my review and you'll see why.  All these other reveiwers obviosly haven't seen the movie, they've all just read articles about how cool it's supposed to be and have hyped themselves up so high that I think they're gonna feel like crying once they've seen the actual movie.  Just so everyone knows this movie is loosely based on Marvels ""Ultimates"" series one written by Mark Millar.  I say loosely because it only takes some of the elemants from that series like costumes. Most everything else is different, even the origins of the team itself is different from in the book.  Some of the crucial parts of the series that really gave it it's originality is completly left out, such as the domestic abuse between ""Giant Man & Wasp"".  I was under the impression this movie was an animated feature geared mainly towards adults.  In some ways I suppose maybe yes, there is maybe some subject matter still left in tact, but definately still geared for a family audiance.  this is not a direct a straight adaptation of the book like I'd heard so much about, some of the visual scenes in the book are there, but not in the same context as in the book.  The other thing about this that bummed me out was the animation.  I heard all this talk about how Lions Gate was using some special state of the art animation, and what you get here is no better than your average saturday morning cartoon stuff.  It honestly looks to me like it was done by the same guys who did the X-Men, Spider Man, Iron Man, Hulk, & Fantastic 4 in the 90's & those shows weren't pretty, this movie may be a step(a small step) above those series.  Basically if you're looking for this to be Mark Millar's Ultimates you might be disapointed, the movie is still entertaining, I guess I was just hoping the film would be a little more faithful to the books original content.  We get to thank Lions Gate yet again for getting our hopes up and letting us down for another less than spectacular straight to video release. Okay I can see if this were a live action film, certain things would have to change obviously.  Comics just don't translate to film as well as we'd all hope they would.  However with this movie being animated, not to mention the fact that this book was practically written to be translated to film, there's really absolutely no excuse for altering the story here at all.  I'd have been okay if the changes were just cutting ""Naked Giant-Man"" or ""Hulk Horny"", these issue's I can see maybe changing if need be for the censor's.  They've altered the story so much; why not just call the movie The Avengers, and leave anything Ultimate out of the picture altogether?  It just really bothers me how badly Lions Gate has intentionally raped this project.  Hopefully another more competent studio will bring us a live action ""Ultimates"" in the future, until then Lions Gate can just about garuntee I'll be skipping the other 5 animated features including ""Ultimate Avengers 2""(How awful does that look?)",N/A

Too prominent, too stupid and in many scenes they should not have been there at all.

The dinosaurs were smart but the story line is really too weak for repeat viewing. I rate this as 5 star for kids but only three for adults.",N/A
1099327,"With Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, director Tim Story attempts to step up the story a few notches by actually providing a real threat that our heroes have to thwart. This film is clearly light years ahead of its predecessor, which really isn't saying that much. The original Fantastic Four was just plain boring. Where the battle scene of the climax of that film was an exercise in the senseless, Rise of the Silver Surfer has the fate of the planet hanging in the balance.At less than 90 minutes, Surfer is short on time-time that could have been used for actually developing something better than the ""Reed and Sue are getting married, so nothing else matters"" subplot. Jessica Alba's portrayal of Sue Storm is actually even more bland than before, which is quite an accomplishment.To my delight, the Thing (Michael Chiklis) actually has a stable relationship in this fim. His brooding in the last film over the most cardboard wife in film history was just tiresome. His girlfriend, Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington), is probably the strongest female role in the film, which doesn't speak well for Sue, the girl who's power is to make her invisible.Of course, Story finds time to have Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) take off his shirt during the film since he knows that the girls and gay boys need something to keep them interested. Sadly, it was probably the brightest point of the film.When the mysterious Silver Surfer comes in to dig monstrous holes into the earth, it spells certain doom. Even Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) steps up to help, even if he always has a trick up his villainous sleeve. The Surfer (voiced by Laurence Fishburne) gives a warning that ""all you know is at an end."" Alas, the movie didn't actually end until nearly an hour later.His warning was that Galactus was on its way to devour the earth. Since that's obviously a bad thing, our heroes actually have to postpone their wedding plans. Poor Sue. The inevitable final wedding is reminiscent of the one seen in Spaceballs. All it lacked was the priest saying, ""Good, you're married! Kiss her!""Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) can probably be awarded ""the dullest hero ever"" award, even though he can stretch himself like silly putty gone horribly wrong. It's a pity that his acting ability has the flexibility of a steel rod encased in concrete. Even still, Rise of the Silver Surfer is far better than its original.In the end, though, it's just not all that fantastic. Perhaps if we changed the name of the film to ""The Tepid Four, Arrival of that Naked Silver Dude,"" we might have a little more of a truthful title.",N/A
1436877,"Sometimes movies have concepts so grand and large-scale that potential viewers can't help but imagine to themselves in advance what they would do with such technology, powers, knowledge, etc.  Imagine if you had the ability to travel through time.  What would you do?  When would you go?  Our imaginations are sparked, and thus, movies about time travel are often disappointing, because their reach never achieves what we'd imagine ourselves doing.LIMITLESS suffers from this as well.  Bradley Cooper plays an author with a serious case of writer's block.  He's smart, but messy and disorganized.  He's handsome but can't be bothered to take care of his appearance.  And he can't get going on the book he's supposed to write.  His girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) is finally tired of him and leaves.  But hope arrives in the form of a new drug that he is given by a distant acquaintance.  It will allow him to access ""100% of his brain.""  Suddenly he's got phenomenal cognitive abilities...particularly the ability to take random scraps of past things he's encountered and to put them together into patterns that no one else can recognize.  It's like the chess player who can envision every possible move and the outcomes of each of those moves.  Cooper finishes his book (and it's brilliant) and then sets about making some serious money with his new powers.With such incredible powers, he seems to strive to accomplish relatively little.  Yes, he wants to make money...that is certainly understandable and relatable.  But he doesn't see a big pattern for himself.  And as a viewer, I was constantly distracted by thinking...""wow, if I had HIS abilities, I'd do so much more.""  It felt a little bit like a failure of the imagination on the part of the filmmakers.  Thus, I felt vaguely disappointed in the film...a great idea that boiled down to a somewhat predictable ""corporate espionage"" kind of thing.Because Cooper discovers that this drug wasn't exactly developed with the approval of the FDA.  The side-effects, particularly of not taking the drug every day, are unpleasant.  And there are some unpleasant, even murderous folks who want the drug, or at least want the abilities that Cooper now has to work to their advantage.  Who can he trust?  How will he get away from all the folks who are now following him?  What will he do when his stock of pills runs out?It's all interesting but a bit generic.  Cooper makes a pretty good leading man here, but he generates little chemistry with the bland Abbie Cornish...so we are not terribly invested in their relationship.  Robert DeNiro is on hand to collect a paycheck as a big shot executive trying to pull of the most ambitious corporate merger in history...and he needs the talent Cooper brings to the table.The most amusing part of the movie is when Cooper has to borrow his initial stake in the stock market from a Russian loan shark, who inadvertently discovers the pill Cooper is taking.  Suddenly, this thuggish character becomes a LOT more dangerous to Cooper than the corporate big-shots.  This showed some creativity and the menace and humor of these scenes was welcome.I recommend LIMITLESS, but my admiration is not...well...limitless.  Cooper is good.  The basic concept is intriguing.  The ""action"" shenanigans are fairly tense, but feel lifted from hundreds of movies that came before.  I realize this is a lazy thing to say, but I'd say wait until it comes out on DVD.",Limitless
628976,"Mel Gibson served as co-producer of this routine revenge thriller that harkens back to the days of Charles Bronson in the original Death Wish.  Cole Hauser stars as Bo Laramie; a rising Hollywood action star who exacts deadly revenge on a group of paparazzis (including Tom Sizemore and sleazy Daniel Baldwin) after they cause a car accident which leaves his wife (Robin Tunney) injured and his young son in a coma.  Investigating the accident and the following crimes is a detective (Dennis Farina) who may or may not know what Bo is up to: all of which spirals towards an unlikely climax where the sleaze balls get what they deserve.  Paparazzi is a generic revenge thriller that is partly inspired, but it's Hauser (who has been in everything from Dazed & Confused to Pitch Black to 2 Fast 2 Furious, and soon to be in the Cave) who carries the film on his shoulders which saves it from complete mediocrity.  There are cameos from other celebrities pampared throughout the film; including Vince Vaughn, Chris Rock, Matthew McConaughey, and even Gibson himself.",Paparazzi

The only one that struck my fancy that particular day was A Haunting at Silver Falls, so I settled in to watch, hoping against hope that this would be one of those rare birds where the public was entirely wrong and this was an overlooked gem. It's not&#8212;there's a little too much &#8220;you really expected me to suspend that much disbelief?&#8221; in the final third of this debut script&#8212;but it's better than I expected given its position at the low end of that particular totem pole.Plot: Jordan (The Bling Ring's Alix Elizabeth Gitter) is a newly-orphaned teen who's been packed off to live with her aunt and uncle, Kevin (X2's Steve Bacic) and Anne (My Best Friend's Wife's Tara Westwood) Sanders. Not long after she arrives at the new homestead, she starts seeing things&#8212;things that turn out (this isn't a spoiler given the cover art) to be the ghosts of a pair of local twins (Gamer's Jade and Nikita Ramsey) whose father is about to be executed for their murder. But why are they haunting Jordan, specifically? And, perhaps more importantly, are they going to get in the way of a possible romance with local nerd Larry (Mansion of Blood's James Cavlo in his feature debut)?Donowho (5 Souls) and a trio of writers all turning in their first script do a competent job. It's not great, and it's certainly not subtle, but it's watchable enough to spend a quick hour and a half with. The Big Reveal is bats enough that you're either going to love it or hate it. I laughed. That doesn't tell you which side I came down on, though, does it?  I thought it was a barrel of cheesy fun. ***",A Haunting at Silver Falls

632136,"Perhaps the script for this film got caught in a windstorm, and they never got the pages in order, because that is how this nearly two hours of aimless filmmaking feels; the dialogue is disjointed, and the fine cast just can't pull it together to make much sense of it.The film suffers from the same repetitive quality and air of pretentiousness that gets the best of Werner Hertzog's 2004 ""documentary"" about the Loch Ness Monster, ""Incident at Loch Ness"", which has a clever concept, but one that soon wears thin. ""The Life Aquatic"" is also a fake documentary, and the premise is that oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) hunts for the mythical Jaguar Shark that ate his friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel). There are many similarities between these two films, so if you enjoyed the Hertzog film, you will like this, and vice versa.Along with Murray and Cassell, the film boasts a cast of many well known actors, including Owen Wilson who plays Murray's presumed son, Cate Blanchett as a reporter, Angelica Huston as Murray's wife, as well as Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, and Bud Cort.The talent that shines the brightest is singer/guitarist Seu Jorge, whose material is excellent (including some David Bowie songs translated into Portuguese), and vocal style wonderful.Writer/director Wes Anderson missed some opportunities here; a more cohesive script and editing would have made this film a far more entertaining adventure, and also greater use of the marvelous stop motion animated effects of marine life, which are a delight, but are few and far between.

1039171,"Hard-core _I Love Lucy_ fans will definitely want to add Seasons 7, 8 and 9 to their DVD collections. However, those who would like to purchase only one or two of the ""Lucy"" collections might want to avoid this offering and focus on the truly-great episodes in the series.As of this writing, I have watched the contents of every disk in the _I Love Lucy_ DVD collections. The show got better and better over the first three years and, in my opinion, the series hit its peak between 1954 and 1955, with the Hollywood episodes contained in Seasons 4 and 5. By this time, the _I Love Lucy_ television show was running like a well-oiled machine. Desi Arnaz' three-camera technique was perfected and would become the industry standard. Writers Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll, Jr. had developed a style that perfectly complemented Lucille Ball's ingenious comic timing, flare for slapstick and hilarious facial expressions. The show was fresh and alive with great gags and consistently-funny dialogue.It was in late 1954 that the Ricardos finally left their tiny New York brownstone apartment so that Ricky could do a screen test for ""Don Juan."" This hilarious epic went on for 27 episodes and began when Ricky came home with a brand new 1955 Pontiac convertible (180 horsepower with automatic transmission) that would transport him, Lucy, Fred and Ethyl to California. They stopped at a Cincinnati motel (this one had the levitating beds), Bent Fork, Tennessee (with Tennessee Ernie Ford and the Borden Twins singing 'Ricochet Romance', Amarillo, Texas and finally Albuquerque, New Mexico where Ethyl put on a solo singing act with the others doing outrageous comic pantomime routines behind her on stage. It was in these episodes that the first on-location scenes were shot.After reaching Hollywood, the Arnaz A-list provided a wealth of Hollywood talent including Aaron Spelling, Eve Arden, William Holden (Lucy's straight man when she does her hilarious putty-nose bit), Bobby (the Phillip Morris bellboy, played by Bob Jellison), Sheila MacRae, Mrs. William Holden, Mrs. Van Heflin, Mrs. Forest Tucker, Allan Ladd, Richard Carlson, Hedda Hopper, Cornel Wilde, Rock Hudson, Harpo Marx, Richard Widmark and John Wayne. Finally, an especially funny episode takes place on the train trip home. Lucy finds plenty of reasons to keep pulling the emergency brake cord -- tossing passengers all over the place -- and she finally ends up capturing a jewel thief.After the Hollywood episodes, the quality of the shows headed downhill as the Ricardos and the Mertzes took a trip to Europe in Season 5. Finally, the Ricardos and the Mertzes moved from New York City to Westport, Connecticut in Season 6, but even the addition of drum-virtuoso Little Ricky couldn't lift the lackluster scripts to the level of those from previous seasons. At the end of Season 6, the show was straining to be good, but the scripts were stale, the laughs were few and everyone was starting to look as tired and worn out as the half-hour show had become in its final year.At the end of Season 6, _I Love Lucy_ was ready for retirement, so it clearly didn't need to be expanded into an hour-long format. Although the hour-long format did produce two noteworthy episodes, ""The Celebrity Next Door"" (originally meant for Bette Davis, but later written to showcase a surprisingly-hilarious performance by Tallulah Bankhead) and ""Lucy Goes To Mexico"" (featuring great comedy and musical numbers from Maruice Chevalier), the overall series had become nothing more than a worn out retread of its former glory.Bottom Line: Others have already commented on the slapped-together look of the final _I Love Lucy_ collection and all of its missing footage. While the 13 episodes of Seasons 7, 8 and 9 aren't nearly as good as those from the _I Love Lucy_ heyday, they aren't all bad either. But the pace is sluggish, the gags are forced and the situations are unconvincing. These final episodes will primarily be of interest to Lucy fans who want to complete their collections. As for myself, I'm glad that I only rented them.",I Love Lucy - The Complete Seasons 7-9

I would have to agree that this movie overall isn't that great, but in retrospect isn't that bad either. I've seen much worse horror ideas brought to film.Yeah, there's some crappy acting from this movie, mainly from the less important characters. The main players in the story do an alright job acting, making it watchable. But I thought the movie had a creepy surrealistic atmopshere that gave it quality. And I thought the actual Mangler itself pulsed with evil and wretchedness. And some the scenes where people get mangled were gory fun. Yeah, I'll admit the scene with the icebox was a little stupid, but could have been much worse. And I thought they did a very good job in the end when the Mangler started moving and actually coming after people. They did it as originally as possible without making it ridiculous. I don't think anyone else could've pulled off a giant ironing machine coming after people as well as Tobe Hooper did.Random Thought: When I rented this, I didn't know it was based on a Stephen King short story and through the whole film I was thinking how much it reminded me of ""Christine.""

1025316,"Michael Mann's previous films ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"" are two masterpieces of the crime genre. Knowing his considerable skill at telling a stylish and gritty story in this genre there were a lot of high hopes for ""Miami Vice"". When I initially saw the film in theaters I was pretty disappointed.  Mann's dialogue was kinda embarrassing and amateurish and the other parts of it were what he calls ""shop talk"" between the cops and the crooks. If you aren't as well versed in it as he is you often don't follow because you don't know what's being said. That is one of Manns' gifts as a director is that he knows this world of crime better than anyone which enables him to make these films as realistic as possible. Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are in a club trying to entrap a pimp when Crockett gets an urgent phone call. It's  from an informant they haven't worked in six months. He sounds terrified and fears for his life and that of his girlfriend. When the boys meet up with him he informs them that a White Supremacist group he was arranging a drug deal with learned who he was working with and he was forced to give  up Crockett and Tubbs. Distraught the man throws himself in front of an oncoming semi. That night after investigating the scene of the crime Crockett and Tubbs get recruited by the Miami P.D.. The local cops want the boys to go undercover for the drug cartel and see the deal through. They also want them to root out the mole who has compromised their identities. This dangerous mission sends the men to exotic locales like the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Paraguay, and eventually Cuba. Their connection is a small time dealer named Yero (John Ortiz in one of the film's best performances ). Crockett and Tubbs pose as smugglers in possession of a super fast boat that is undetectable by radar since it travels low and fast. Yero doesn't trust them but Isabella, his banker,  does. She is played by the beautiful Gong Li and with two lookers like her and Colin Farrell a romance is inevitable. Crockett and Tubbs figure out how low on the chain Yero is and realize that they are going to have do numerous drops until they find the higher up responsible for the murder of their informant. Since Crockett is escorting Isabella to Cuba for the perfect mojito Tubbs is left to arrange the meetings with the dealers. This causes friction between the two partners since everyone but Crockett realizes the danger he is in by sleeping with Yero's woman. With Mann directing and the above mentioned locales the film looks great and he has assembled a capable cast who all give good performances. Foxx does a lot more of the work than Farrell making him a little more like able. Ortiz is a very colorful villain in the ""Scarface"" tradition. Gong Li does a good job of capturing the fear and independence of a woman involved in this line of work. As with most Mann films  the background players are deserving of a lot more screen time. In this case you have the excellent Justin Theroux who is part of Crockett and Tubb's team and the gorgeous and talented Naomie Harris who is Ricardo's girlfriend Trudy. The two have a fair amount of scenes but I wish they could have been written a little better rather than just appearing in the background as support for Crockett and Tubbs. The action scenes are few and far between but when they happen they are easily the best thing going for the film. The last half hour in particular is exactly what made Heat and Collateral masterpieces. You wish that that kind of energy and excitement happened more often rather than coming all at once in the film's final act.",N/A

Predator"" grossed a couple million less, but made up for it with a far-sturdier script and dazzling special effects display.The screenplay is well-below prolific, but as far as monster movies go it should win the Monster Oscar.  The dialogue is not jerky or forced, the settings are SMART (thank goodness it's set in present day, on Earth, and not on some unbelievable distant planet or some floating space ship - we've reverted to ancient history rather than space-age fiction), and the development and flow is speedy and quick with enough suspense in just the right places.  The writers deserve a loft paycheck for making such an unlikely meeting so much fun to watch, weaving the two movie franchises together (with direct assistance from the comic book, no doubt), and paying attention to plot and dialogue when other script writers would have relied solely on gore to sustain the movie.The acting is less-than-impressive, but, again, the film creators were on-task to assist.  Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson along with a team of 6 other contributing scriptees excelled so astoundingly that they pumped enough appeal and energy into their cast - helping to elevate them from ""B"" movie actors to ""B+"" actors with the flip of a pen and the turn of a lens.  Sigourney Weaver is painfully absent (as a prequel, her character hadn't been born yet), but Arnold Schwarzenegger is thankfully M.I.A.  (Though it might have been fun to see Weaver cream Arnold's butt.)The cinematography is unexpectedly progressive and smooth.  The camera movements, lighting, and set design are smart and efficient.  The special effects are some of the best I've ever seen, and certainly more convincing and impressive than any of this film's ancestors.  The long-headed, saliva-toothed Aliens are more alive than I've seen them before (mama Alien even comes out to run amuck this time), and Mr. Predator's dreadlocks have never looked more lively and quick.  The scenes in the ancient, underground pyramid get a bit too monotonous after a time, and the repetitive far-off eerie sounds (oh my we should be scared!) aren't as effective or as chilling as they ought to be, but you can't help but feel an impeccable rush of adrenalin when the two vile foes come face to face time and again.Now that it's on DVD, see it.Grade: C+",AVP: Alien vs. Predator
326183,"This film has the ability  and the drive to be a serious wake-up call for parents, teachers, and students.  Unfortunatly, it jumps from drama to comedy so much that you feel that the producers-writers-directors have long gave up on the film or at least can't make up their minds.  Don't get me wrong, there is a messege to be heard here, but the writers can't seem to hit it on the head, just what they want to say. A quick example would be when the school is raided by the police, and they conduct a search of all the lockers.  A clearly mentally disturbed student (played wonderfully by Crispen Glover) is shot for trying to remove a gun from his locker.  Instead of going with this impact for a while and trying to get into the other character's head, the film quickly jumps to comedy by the next scene. And that's the end of that.  The school is being sued by an ex-student who graduated without learning to read.  It is an honest and hard look at our education sysytem, and again, the politics that get in the way.  Nolte is outstanding as always, as is Judd Hirsh in a strong post Taxi role.  The problem is:  How can viewers take ""Teachers"" seriously when we feel that the filmmakers themselves don't?",N/A

The costuming and the interiors/exteriors are top-notch but that silly music that the other reviewers mention is indeed annoying and is so irrelevant to the storyline. I was not watching PBS and British dramas in the late 70's so I am not familiar with any of the actors who star in the series. I am surprised it has not been re-made since it has alot of potential with the right cast and a better soundtrack. I am on disc three, so I am anxious to see how it wraps up. The music really ruins this in my opinion since it sounds too contemporary for the time period. I prefer Monarch of the Glen or Berkeley Square which are both well written and acted without the awful music.",Flambards Collection Set VHS

Goldie Hawn plays one of these women while Kurt Russell plays a coworker who winds up seducing her.I like both of these actors but this film wasn't a good vehicle for them.

So far I've only watched season 1+2 & it's hard to watch as my mind keeps focusing on the poor video quality.My guess is (based on the fact that they initially offered only a couple of seasons, best of,... we bought those, then they finally come out with complete set) that they will be offering a higher quality blu-ray version in the next couple of years so those of us who couldn't wait will be forced to fork over another $100 to finally get a decent quality complete series.Update: After watching the entire dvd series...I'll admit that Larry really started to annoy me with the constant whining & narcissism & fawning over every female star that appeared on his show.

602963,"I'm going to try to give the person who hasn't seen this yet what to expect without giving away the storyline. (Storyline?)Movie traces the lives of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera from the time the schoolgirl and friends first ogle him and his model when he comes to town, to their marriage, their divorce, their re-marriage and...it's frankly hard to tell what happens at the end, but I assumed Sra. Kahlo was near death.Be warned, there is a lot of sex and nudity. There is also a lot of blood, and a particularly graphic scene involving an embryo. Those familiar with the career of Kahlo will not be surprised at this. Those unfamiliar may wince at all of this.On the plus side, there are some really cool visual effects involving some puppetry and other low-tech graphics, as you might expect from The Lion King's Julie Taymor. Pay close attention to the paintings in the movie.All in all, I personally found a visually beautiful movie which dangerously smelled of lacking a plot. Point-of-view changes constantly from narration to observation. If the unsuspecting moviegoers keep the kids at home, turn their heads during the grosser parts, and do not expect a strict biopic, I think they may find it, at the very least, interesting. It's not a feel-good movie by any stretch, but it's not totally pessimistic, either. In fact, I found myself not knowing what exactly to feel by the end of it.",Frida

1164283,"There are times when movies can blow you away.  The first Transformers movie certainly blew me away.  Despite its problems, it was a fun ride with a well crafted story and even some well crafted dialog and sequence of events.  Transformers Revenge of the Fallen, however, shows us that bigger isn't always better.  In fact, bigger can be a headache.  Especially when it's a Michael Bay sequel.The film brings back Shia Lebouf and Megan Fox as our protagonists.  As it turns out, the Transformers actually came to earth a lot sooner than we thought.  In the year 17,000 BC to be exact.  A war happened involving some of the machines.  As it turns out, the Fallen were sealed... but they may soon rise again.  And Sam (played by Shia) has the key to this, which the Decepticons want to get a hold of.  And quickly.Anyway, Sam is off to college and as far as he is concerned, Bumblebee's job is done.  His parents are rather emotional over seeing him go (particularly his mother), but things could be worse, right?  Well, as it turns out, when he gets to college he meets a strange guy who has been tracking these ""aliens"" for some time, ever since the incident happened two years ago.  Apparently the Government is so good at covering things up they were able to make sure no one could remember all the chaos that happened right in the middle of the streets of the first film... in broad daylight.  Even stranger is that Sam still has a piece of the cube (All Spark) and despite holding onto it for two years, only now manages to touch it.  When he does, however, he begins to see a bunch of symbols in his head that he doesn't know anything about.These symbols, however, play  much bigger role than he could imagine.  The Fallen, it turns out, will rise again sometime.  And only one Autobot can stop them... Optimus Prime.  Unfortunately through circumstances it's a wonder if he can.  Even worse is how more decepticons are coming forth and finding most f the good guys.  Not to mention there's another man in the government hoping to mess things up because they believe that it's the fault of the Autobots that the Decepticons are coming in the first place.  And Michael Bay makes sure you really don't like this guy.Meanwhile, the Decepticons are after Sam because he knows something that's been implanted into his brain.  The end result is that the Autobots along with Sam and Mikeala--and a few supporting characters--have to stop the Fallen from rising again.On paper it sounds rather simple, but the movie is a lot more convoluted than it actually sounds.  It not so much that the plot makes little sense as it is that it keeps throwing one thing after another into the mix.  By the time the movie concludes you might find yourself having a little too much information.  But more than that, there's a lot of time spent away from the plot.  The first movie, for the most part, had very appropriate jokes that came at just the right moments.  Revenge of the Fallen throws several jokes at a wall hoping something will stick.  You'll get a good share of laughs, but also a lot of jokes that fall flat in the process.However, it's mostly Michael Bay's filming technique that makes the movie something of a drag.  In many instances the camera angles are incredibly weird and shaky.  When the robots are fighting it's really hard to get into the fight scenes because they're so chaotic and because the camera is constantly jerking around.  More often than not, you lose focus in the middle of the battle.  There are also tons of new robots introduced.  Good and bad.  Unfortunately the movie doesn't give us enough time to get to know any of them.  So much so that in some fights it was hard to tell the good guys from the bad.  Which brings up another thing, the fights themselves can be spectacular, but on the whole they're a little long.  Many moments in the movie are too overdone for their own good.The story in and of itself comes together but the way it comes together might leave some movie goers feeling cheated in some ways.  If anyone here has ever heard of the term ""Deus Ex Machina"" (which means ""God from the Machine"") then you should know that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is full of them.  In nearly impossible situations, amusing coincidences come into play.  Sam and friends need to get to Egypt upon JUST discovering they need to go there... they magically get there.  They find an old Transformer who is a Decepticon who just happens to have switched sides.  One of the most heart pounding moments of the entire movie is ruined by a Deus Ex Machina that looks as though Michael Bay and company decided to just tack it on.  There's plot and story but a lot of it comes off as an after thought.  Most of i just felt like things they tacked on to make sure that things come out just fine for our protagonists involved.  Every heart pounding moment is immediately crushed when you realize that no matter what happens, none of the characters are in any real danger because of many ""amusing coincidences.""  It makes the movie come as more predictable.That's not to say it isn't fun.  When you're not being given a headache by the camera work, the special effects are spectacular, and some of the fights are really good.  It's just that its hard to enjoy them because of the awkward camera movements and shifts.  Even Paul Greengras knew when we needed a break.That's not all, the movie is incredibly long.  Around two and half hours.  But it doesn't quite pass the butt-shifting contest.  A lot of scenes are long and drawn out.  The final battle in and of itself can make you feel like you're sitting through the incredibly long ending of Lord of the Rings.  It's not that it's long which can grate on the nerves so much as it is that Bay and his crew stuffed way too much in a movie.  Suffice to say, how long was this movie supposed to be before it was cut down?  There are so many characters and plot devices introduced that it's a wonder it could all e contained in one film.The acting, for the most part, isn't really all that bad, but there's far too much acting to care.  This is all about Shia.  Megan Fox is there, but she serves no real purpose other than to give the boys something to stare at between action sequences.One thing that might raise a few eyebrows however, may be ""The Twins.""  Where would Michael Bay be without ethnic stereotypes?  Here, the Twins are so stereotypical you wonder if Bay was trying to be offensive or funny.  I'm guessing it was the latter option of the two, but the crew on Transformers 2 did go a little overboard with it.Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is a visual spectacle but not much else beyond that.  To put it all in context, it's not hard to understand, but it's definitely cluttered.  And the director does nothing to make sure we care about the characters.  We don't learn much more about them than what the first movie gave us.  There's hardly any development.  It's pleasing to the eye, but little beyond that.",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
332028,"I have loved science fiction and fantasy since I was two years old. When I was 11 years old I tried to watch 2001 A Space Odyssey, and it is the only science fiction film I never finished watching as a little girl, the movie just got to boring, and that is saying something as I ate up anything with space ships. However now an adult woman of 28 years I decided to give this movie another watch, thinking that I was probably to young to get it when I first tried to sit down and see it. So last night me and my hubby sat down with 2001 on blu-ray.I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this movie. Let me take the good first. When you take into account that this movie was made in 1968 the special effects are amazing, the space station, the space ships, the spinning interior of the main ship, all of it is just amazing, the effects even hold up today, they are just beautifully done. The movie is set to a score made up mostly off classical music and that all combine to create a beautiful film.The story is very original and it is more than a simple let us go out in space and look for aliens tale, the film is deeply philosophical. I could not really give you a summary of the film without spoiling it, and it is really more about the journey, you would have to experience the story for yourself. The characters are very well done and feel very real, and off course you have Hal, perhaps the most iconic AI character off all time. This is both a classical science fiction space tale, and a philosophical discussion about evolution, morality and even God.Ok now to the bad. Some scenes go on forever. There are several space docking sequences which take many minutes to complete, the whole first of the movie is composed of men in monkey suits dancing around that that just go on forever and at the end of the movie there are a nearly 20 minuted acid trip which is nothing but lights and sounds swirling around. I lost patience with the film and stopped caring about the plot, there is a limit to how long I find it interesting to watch swirling lights or a pen floating in zero G.Another problem with 2001 is that allot of time is spent with a scientist, we learn that he has a daughter he is estranged to, his character is really developed, and then he is just discarded and never seen again, a third problem with the movie is that it was made alongside a novel and without it there are things which are really hard to understand.I have one big issue with the blu-ray as well. In the middle of the movie there is a five minutes section where the screen go dark and there are just music playing. This was when the movie took a break in the theater so people could go buy more popcorn. However why keep this in the blu-ray, that long part where the screen is black should have been cut.I can not be to hard on this film as it is a classic, and it is a masterpiece. The visuals are amazing, and the movie do make you think. The film should have been shorter, it is not a film to watch if you do not have allot of patience. Also if you expect traditional science fiction you will not get it here. However if you are looking for an art film with a plot then this might just be the movie for you.",N/A

1565625,"These films, Red and #2 are ninety-five percent action, of course. But there is actually some acting which takes place, primarily on the part of Malkovitch! According to what I read it says that #2 stayed in the theaters for four months, which is a good run. By the time I saw it, it was already being set for video, so distribution must not have been extensive. #2 must have been relatively expensive to make, filming in the world's major capitals and blowing up so much stuff! We wish more producers could afford to do this with their films. That said, there's something not quite right about the writing in these films. The major premise of the Red's is that it's OK to murder viciously, as long as the victim deserves it! We have retired CIA people murdering other CIA people who are constantly trying to murder them. It's all OK because secret agents and operatives are evil and deserve to die, which for some odd reason is written to be humorous. And that's the major premise of these films. Watching the older female assassin dissolving a dying agent in nitric acid in the tub, as she jokes on the phone sends an odd message. It is well-understood that these types of operatives have no morality, no morals and no particular understanding of right and wrong; and this is apparent in real life as well.

Incredibly gifted actors like Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, and Ian McKellen were compelled to utter the most banal lines perhaps in their entire careers. I suspected the ending almost half way through the picture.  I have not read Dan Brown's book. The fact that the novel revolves around the possibility of a generation-to-generation conspiracy is inherently preposterous.  Real people rarely keep secrets. A large number never do. The very premise of The Da Vinci Code contradicts everything we know about human psychology. Homo sapiens do not remain loyal to a religious institution they know is premised upon lies. Moreover, they are especially unlikely to murder on its behalf.  I may be an ex-Catholic, but I refuse to indulge in blind hatred towards my former religious home. The Church of Rome deserves better than this slanderous attack.An earlier reviewer perspicaciously pointed out that ""The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.""

618477,"It's hard to knock Richard Curtis: as a writer, he's more-or-less singlehandedly revived the fortunes of the British film industry, comedy or otherwise. That said, his vein of humour - gentle for the most part, with alternating bouts of sentimentality and vulgarity - is an acquired taste.Anyone who found sitting through Notting Hill or Bridget Jones a bit of a struggle might want to pass on Love, Actually. This is Curtis in extremis, from the ""love is all around"" mantra to the bumbling Hugh Grant character, the big musical numbers to the Christmas setting.There are no less than eight stories on offer, running the gamut from schoolboy infatuation to full-on marital infidelity. Some of the plots are a hoot: I defy anyone, for instance, not to enjoy washed-up rocker Billy Mack's (Bill Nighy) quest for Christmas Number One. There are some strong performances, too - Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are particularly good as an estranged married couple.Elsewhere, though, Curtis's preference for quantity over quality gets a bit irritating. The central romance, between Grant's bumbling prime minister and Martine McCutcheon's tea lady, could happily fill a whole movie. The fact that it's given so little screen time here just robs the characters' final declarations of love of any meaning. Curtis may have intended to create a towering monument to the glories of l'amour, but instead he often ends up reducing ""I love you"" to a banal platitude.Still, as an entertaining bit of fluff, this just about succeeds. Fans of Curtis's previous work, and anyone of a diehard romantic bent, will probably find much to enjoy here.",Love Actually

525700,"So as is often the case, this movie isn't as good as the book, but it is still a must buy for the DVD collection. I watched it again recently and was surprised just how young the actors are in this film, compared to later films. They really do a great job and the director is reasonably true to the book. I'm still not convinced Harry potter is actually a kids movie. I think I would have been freaked out as a child. However this first movie is pretty slow moving and has loads of lovely scenes and ideas that kids will just love. Be warned it does get scary in patches.This is a great introduction to the land of magic. We meet Professor Dumbledore, Hagrid, Harry Potter (and his Muggle family), all within the opening minutes; And of course Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger aren't too far behind once Harry gets to Hogwarts. The magic of the first book is brought to life in this first movie, and the best thing I think about it is that it is virtually stand-alone. No previous knowledge is required and nothing but a vivid imagination is needed. It is exactly the sort of movie I would have enjoyed watching as a kid, and it has the same appeal to me today as Disneyland does.",N/A
60078,"The opening speech by Lelaina (Winona Ryder) at the beginning sets an accurate mood for the rest of the film: optimism tinged with confusion and a lack of direction. In reality, the young adults in this film depict only a small slice of their generation, those who ""aren't interested in the counterculture that they [our parents] invented as if we did not see them disembowel their revolution for a pair of running shoes."" I may be a few years behind the generation portrayed in the film, but I'm not entirely without empathy for the restless plight of this group of slackers. Even so, the speech is a horrible oversimplification of the generation gap of the time, and the film is more easily digested if the core group of characters is seen as only one slice of a very large generation.There is a lot of similarity between Reality Bites and films likeGarden StateandHarold and Maude, sharing the same ennui and restlessness that seems insatiable and overwhelming. The striking difference, though, is Reality Bites' strong sense of friendship and community as a means of overcoming this ennui. I felt that if any of these characters were left entirely to himself, he would commit suicide, and the core group of friends is what saved them all.Unfortunately, their friendships are not enough to keep them from slipping into a dangerous selfishness and narcissism: Lelaina refuses for a while to find a paying job, and only seems to be attracted to Troy (Ethan Hawke) because of the emotions he conjures up in her; Troy, even after saying that she is the only woman he could commit to, says, ""You can't navigate me, I might do mean things, and I might hurt you and I might run away without your permission""; Vickie (Janeane Garofalo) is addicted to sex but hates the thought of a lasting relationship; and Sammy (Steve Zahn) is full of wounded pride. Michael (Ben Stiller) is intellectually shallow, but he seems to be the only person with any emotional maturity, and he easily sees through Troy's snobby attitude.ENDING SPOILERS: The film ends with a romance between Lelaina and Troy that seems destined to end badly if Troy doesn't wise up and accept the criticism that's been levelled at him. There's a part of me that cheered for him, but a larger part that wanted to smack him in the face until he wised up and applied for grad school. The problem with these kids is that they are immature, and have no ideal of maturity to attain to. Their parents (of the rebellious 60s generation) rejected their own parents' ideas of maturity, and so their own children have very little left to work with. Reality Bites is more of a romantic tragedy than a romantic comedy, even though it seems to turn out well in the end. I really wanted the characters to find something better to build their lives on, but when the credits rolled I was afraid they would just keep repeating their mistakes for the rest of their lives.For what it's worth, the acting and directing are quite good, though not great. I got a kick out of seeing so many big-name actors at a younger age. Ben Stiller's direction is good, and not as manic as what he later did inZoolander. Unfortunately there aren't any special features except production notes and a forgettable trailer.",Reality Bites

582025,"Massacre at Central High (Rene Daalder, 1976)I first saw Massacre at Central High over a quarter-century ago, probably on HBO, and have been searching for it again ever since. I finally managed to track down a copy thanks to a recent overseas DVD release (it's about time we got a domestic one, no?); while this is by no means deathless cinema-- Daalder started his career as a cameraman for Russ Meyer-- it is, if anything, even better than I remembered it being.David (Derrell Maury) is the new kid at an exclusive high school. One of his old friends, Mark (Andrew Stevens), already goes there. He's fallen in with the school bullies, and plans to use his affiliation with them to protect David. David, unfortunately, has other plans, both in standing up to them himself and organizing the rest of the students against them. The bullies, of course, have other plans, and soon the conflict has escalated.It's impossible to get to what really makes this movie so gripping without going into major spoilers; we'll just say that things reach a rather absurd conclusion (hinted at in the title)-- and then go two or three steps further in the movie's final act. This is a movie where the scenario does all the work; the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the soundtrack, all are average at best (and plumb some truly strange depths at worst; Rainbeaux Smith, topless, idly playing with a box of dynamite, may be a nadir in seventies exploitation cinema, where outright silliness is concerned. Not that you're likely to notice, given that, well, Rainbeaux Smith is topless). But the concept is so outlandish that it somehow works. If you missed this one on the cult cinema circuit, it's certainly worth looking up now. ***",Massacre at Central High

1377848,"ost of the other reviews have complained about the modifications to the film, so I'll talk about something else: the layout of the menu options. The way it's organized is really cumbersome. The bonus features are organized by movie, then by planet, then by type of feature. Given that the only reason many people bought this set was to see the deleted scenes, it just means having to go through many layers to get to the deleted scenes, then you have to backtrack to see the deleted scenes for EACH planet. I can't imagine who thought organizing the features by planet was a good idea. To make things worse, there's no ""play all"" option for the deleted scenes. Again, a simple, standard option that makes life easier.Most of the new deleted scenes themselves aren't particularly exciting and it's clear why they were cut. Amongst the prequels, the only one I enjoyed was the ROTS Elevator Antics because it really shows the bond between Obi-Wan and Anakin. I also liked the Anakin-Palpatine relationship in Amending the Constitution. The really gems are the original trilogy deleted scenes. It was truly magical seeing scenes we've heard about for three decades but never seen. . I personally think the Anchorhead scene should have stayed in the movie because it's great characterization for Luke. It's even great seeing rough cuts of the Cantina. The ESB scenes weren't quite as dramatic, although I did like seeing the extra footage of the pre-1997 Wampas. But it's clear those scenes would have detracted from the film. ROTJ also has some neat scenes, such as the one of Luke building the lightsaber - another one that could easily have made it to the final cut. The expanded scenes with Moff Jerjerrod really build up his character and make him a much more sympathetic. I really do wish they'd kept that in.I want to be clear: these movies look gorgeous on blu-ray. However, they didn't look bad on DVD. The main selling feature of this blu-ray was the bonus features and I just think they could have - and should have - had an easier layout. Hopefully future releases will streamline the menu options. I hate to give Star Wars just 3 stars, but I really think this release could have and should have been better.",Star Wars: The Complete Saga - Episodes I-VI
471774,"George has a really great voice. It is strong and has a lot of varity and colour. However I gave this DVD away as I just didnt like his style of videos. I almost kept it for the one concert clip as I think he is actaully at his best in a concert belting it out and connecting with his fans.The videos are good visual quality and sound but watching one after the other back to back I found I was really put off by the progression of gyrating near-naked woman sexually provocative and pouting at the camera.Hey - I dont see myself as a prude but I'm a woman and women just dont turn me on by being provocative. I don't need to share my living room with them in such quantity as they do nothing for me, I don't identify with them and for me they detract from George.The best video clip for me was the simplest - George in white, on his own, really getting into and expressing the soul and mood of a song.The question is why George has needed the women thing throughout his videos. Is it because this has become current video style (unfortunately)?Is it because men like to communicate to other men their place in the pecking order by being able to attract and be surrounded by 'babes' (and isnt George's voice and standing beyond the need for those games?)Was George trying to show he can hold his own in a straight world even though he has been 'bi-' in sexuality and when falling in love prefers men?So why does he need this whole female thing when I'd guess most of his fans are women and like me arent turned on by this stuff so it misses the mark?I havent seen myself as a women's lib type, and certainly not moralistic - but I really am, as a modern woman, rather tired of all the objectifying of women. George is about the last person who needs to keep flogging these sex images. He stands tall in all respects as an entertainer and he seems to be a genuinely nice guy who can afford to simplify and just share himself with audiences.I've had the CD set that matches these videos so as these dont distract with the images bye-bye DVD - and hopefully looking forward to a George Michael concert DVD if one is ever released!",N/A

1571596,"American NightmareThe ""Katarina's Nightmare Theatre"" range of DVD's from Scorpion Releasing has brought new life to some long forgotten horror gems from the video era, and I for one am very happy about that.  I genuinely feel that - despite some snoozers and losers - their overall range is one of the most fan-friendly and interesting on the market today.  This film hasn't been available in my neck of the world since the days of videotape, so it's a welcome addition to my collection.""American Nightmare"" is an early-eighties Canadian tax-shelter production from Paul Lynch, the man behind ""Prom Night"" and ""Humongous"".  It's a grimier film than either of those, and deliberately so. It's not ""Maniac"" level grimy, and there are some occasional light moments, but overall an attempt has been made here to deglamourize the big city and emphasize its potential to degrade and dehumanize.  The story revolves around a murdered young woman from a good family who had fallen into a life of prostitution and general seediness.  The subsequent attempt by her brother to solve the mystery of her death sees him navigating through a sordid milieu of drugs, death and degenerates (and startling videotapes).  The denizens of this underworld are mostly unsympathetic (except the obligatory stripper with a heart of gold who assists him with his quest), and everybody is motivated by the desire to extract whatever they can from absolutely anybody else.  Perversion lurks everywhere in this urban nightmare and nobody can be trusted, not even dear old Dad. Yikes.This is a worthwhile viewing experience if you come to it knowing what to expect.  Things aren't bright and pretty here, and I'm not just talking about Michael Ironside (playing a detective, and very well too).  The city is grey and dangerous, the strippers are past their prime, the cops don't know things they should, the pimps aren't pleasant, nobody is helpful and street life has consequences. (It almost sounds like a documentary).  There are points in the film when the killer could conceivably be almost any member of the cast, some genuine suspense is generated (at times), and the conclusion isn't what you might have anticipated.  When it comes to watching this type of movie, you could do much worse than this.There is one major negative with this DVD - it is full-frame.  A title card prior to the commencement of the film indicates that only fullscreen elements were available from the distributor (probably a video master).  It's better than having nothing of course, but I would love to have this in widescreen.  Colours are muted, but that just adds to the atmosphere in my humble opinion.  Extras include a feature commentary with Paul Lynch and Katarina (as well as a very informative interview with him), an audio interview with writer John Sheppard, and some trailers for other films in the product line.Overall, this is an interesting diamond-in-the-rough DVD and I for one will be looking out for more resurrected gems from Katarina in the near future.",N/A

1293493,"Paris is a complex web of interconnected stories that messily tie together, leaving a lot of loose ends but also simulating the messiness of real life.The film centers around Pierre (Duris), a young man who finds out he may be dying from a heart condition and will need a transplant in order to survive.  His sister, Elaine (Binoche), is the only one in his family he initially tells of his condition and she promptly moves her and her children to live with him though they have previously been distant.  Pierre, a former dancer, is no longer able to perform due to his heart condition, and now finds pleasure in observing the lives of those around him--nods to Hitchcock's &#34;Rear Window&#34;.  Among those is an attractive young woman living in an apartment across the street from his, and her story is perhaps just as interesting--she is torn between two suitors, one a fellow student and the other an older man.  While Elaine is assisting Pierre in the physical sense by helping with meals and cleaning, she benefits as much as him if not more from their repaired relationship--after Pierre convinces her to live her life fully, Elaine opens up to a friendly longtime acquaintance, with satisfying results.The acting in this film is brilliant, even though I speak English and watched most of this film on mute, just reading the subtitles, I didn't feel that I missed out. Binoche's Elaine is melancholy and wounded at times, and sexy and playful at others--depicting her character in a believable and yet striking way.  Pierre, the lead, is played by Duris and the expressiveness in his body language shows his introspection and struggle with his own feelings about mortality.The only thing that I didn't quite get was the plot...a few of the stories fit well and intertwined, but a lot of the extraneous side stories didn't really fit in with the main plot and instead confused me, making the film difficult to follow (i.e. the man immigrating to Paris from Africa, the whole backstory with the professor, etc.)  The film was overall good, because of its memorable acting, but the tangled web of story lines left a lot to be desired.",N/A
259365,"The colossal failure of ""Cruising"" in 1980 should have been easy to predict. When you make a story about extreme taboo topics (Gay SM murders) and couple it with a bizarre, disjointed script, then outright refuse to make a linear story out of it (I could never figure out why the killer always seemed to be a different person with the same creepy voice), then you arrive with a film that hardly anyone in 1980 would sit through.Ironically enough, one of the most controversial points to the movie now seems almost nostalgic. The seedy SM underground bars like The Cellblock or The Anvil that used to inhabit lower Manhattan's Meat Packing district are a memory now, replaced by nightclubs, condos, yuppies and the locations of a bunch of ""Sex in the City"" shoots. The notorious Lure Bar, the final and long gone holdout of this era, was even used as a ""Sex in the City"" backdrop - with little or no controversy attached. How things have changed.That makes the ""shocking"" hyper-sexuality of the bar scenes somewhat bemusing. Yes, in the ""Boogie Nights"" mania of the late 70's, prior to AIDS, skyrocketing property values and Rudy Giuliani, these playspaces and these activities did happen. It was underground, wild, crazy...and as William Friedkin saw it, a perfect backdrop for a crime mystery. Al Pacino (who has professed his distaste for the final cut of ""Cruising"" and is conspicuous in his absence from the DVD extras) was keen on taking a part that would be unconventional and nonconformist. So he donned a leather jacket and took the role of Steve Burns, a young undercover cop who fits a ""common victim"" profile.Thus begins a peculiar game of cat and mouse, with Pacino trying to pass as a gay leather daddy and showing all the signs of a conflict with his inner closet. Which, in the bizarre ending to this movie, is left a hanging question...especially with the little piece of business concerning Karen Allen. There are some bits of unintended humor, like when Powers Boothe attempts to explain the Hankie Code to Pacino and when an irritated bar patron snaps at Pacino about flagging the wrong color. But for the most part, the focus on seediness and the disconnected pacing of the script keep most of ""Cruising"" at a level where the suspense is at a minimum.In fact, the most revealing thing about this ""deluxe"" DVD (hard to define it as such, since there has never been a ""basic"" edition) is the pair of featurettes. In ""The History of Cruising"" and ""Exorcising Cruising,"" Friedkin and others dissect what they were trying to accomplish with ""Cruising"" and why they didn't look at it as a gay movie. They also partially explain the ambiguity with the killer's many faces/one voice trick (giving it an almost horror/supernatural bent, and consideringThe Exorcist, hardly a stretch). A former detective who was a consultant for the movie explains the presence of the musclebound cop in the jock-strap, among other plot points. The interviews with minor cast members almost 30 years later are interesting as well.The features (in particular, ""Exorcizing Cruising"") also address the controversy. While I can see the point that there was a dearth of gay characters in the movies and therefore a gay serial killer made lots of folks virulently uneasy, I was personally more insulted byThe Boys in the Bandthan ""Cruising."" Even with the backdrop a serial killer movie, the men in the bar scenes are looking like they are hitting the bars because they belong there and are enjoying themselves; as opposed to the bitter, regretful losers of TBITB cast of closet queens.What the commentaries don't address is why ""Cruising,"" which is a dynamite movie for atmosphere and grit, was ultimately such an incoherent mess. There's a great soundtrack featuring The Germs, Mink DeVille and John Hiatt when he was punky, a twist from the usual disco-drenched music of any movie tagged as ""gay."" And finally, there is Pacino. Looking for all the world like a damaged and conflicted man, the ambiguity of the final third of ""Cruising"" (Is he gay or not? Is Burns maybe a killer, too? Who is that leatherman going into the bar at the end?) made for an unsatisfying finale. More a curiosity now than a controversy, ""Cruising"" is now a strange look into a time long passed.Incidentally, given the notorious bent to ""Cruising's"" history, it is interesting to think about some of the movies after that bear a resemblance.Hard,8MMand even modern horror movies likeHostelor theSawmovies owe a debt to ""Cruising.""",Cruising VHS

944200,"Wedding Crashers is a comedy that is arguably the biggest hit of it's kind this year. I'm sure there are some better films available out there but this is the kind that gets all the media's attention. Comedy is a genre that lacks depth. Mixing Will Ferrel towards the end of the film was a clever move. Although his short appearance doesnt make you go bonkers with laughter, it was mildly amusing. Wedding Crashers has some great humor and Owne Wilson's stand out performance astonished me. For some reason, this is the best Comedy performance he has given.Do not even look for any ""real"" chemistry between Rachel McAdams(Goodness,she's beautiful) and Owen Wilson's character. The grandmother in the film plays a funny role in being honest. I thought they overdid the slot of the teenage gay artist. Vince Vaughn gives a role worth being acknowledged. It's his fast, unbrash, unabrasive yet loud side that made the crowd roar.Although there is nothing in this film that I disliked, Wedding Crashers is at best, one of the finer three star grade movies you will see.

1347806,"Flandersui Gae (A Dog of Flanders/Barking Dogs Never Bite) (Joon-ho Bong, 2000)Joon-ho Bong has developed into one of Korea's most popular directors both at home and overseas, first with The Host, the highest-grossing Korean film of all time (viz. review 10Mar2008 ish), and then with Mother, one of the most critically-acclaimed Korean films of all time (viz. review 30Mar2011 ish). But he had a career, and a durned good one, long before coming up with either of those flicks; his second movie, Memories of Murder, is actually my favorite of his flicks (viz. review 1Apr2008 ish), and while it didn't really gain notoriety outside Korea until after he'd gotten big for his other movies, his debut feature, Flandersui Gae (known in English-speaking countries both as A Dog of Flanders and Barking Dogs Never Bite), was a pretty big hit back in the day. If you know Bong's later work, there's not going to be a good deal here that will surprise you--it's got that patented Bong mix of madcap mystery, uncomfortable humor, broad-spectrum ineptitude on the part of his endearing characters, and a sharp, witty script that brings it all together in a pleasurable way.Plot: Yun-ju (Attack the Gas Station!'s Sun-jae Lee) is a college lecturer who's trying to achieve a professorship in a corrupt culture--it seems to be standard operating procedure for lecturers at his school who want to become professors to ""gift"" the dean with ten thousand bucks. Problem is, lecturers make peanuts, so where's he going to get that kind of money? As if that's not enough, somewhere in his large, faceless apartment block there's a yappy little dog who refuses to shut up. Yun-ju finds himself driven to extremes--once he has identified the beast, he kidnaps it. When he finds he can't bring himself to kill it, he locks it in a cabinet in the basement. When the missing-dog posters start going up, posted by both the dog's young owner and Hyeon-nam (Spring Bears Love's Doona Bae), an interested bookkeeper from the local tax office who had to give the posters an official stamp to make sure the cops didn't take them down, Yun-ju realizes he's got himself a case of mistaken identity--but when he goes to set the pooch free, it's gone...And this kicks off a series of misadventures that has the movie careering wildly between missing-dog mystery (animal lovers beware, there are a few scenes you may find uncomfortable despite the large, prominently-displayed title card at the beginning stating that no animals were harmed during the making of the film), romantic comedy, and Richard Linklater-style slacker drama, with the odd action sequence here and there just to keep the viewer on his or her toes. Like Memories of Murder, the end result seems somewhat directionless, and that does seem a bit more of a problem here than it is in Memories of Murder. But not much more; this movie is still a great deal of fun, as well as being quite technically accomplished for it being the director's feature debut. If you're a Joon-ho Bong fan who's never gotten the chance to check this one out, it may not quite measure up to Bong's later efforts, but it's still a pretty good time. ***",Barking Dogs Never Bite

694422,"This was a waste of money for me. I read and loved the graphic novels, so I figured that I would like this just as much. NOT! This was a major disappointment.The storyline of the manga was fast-paced, humorous, and very entertaining. Although it occasionally became difficult to distinguish what was going on, on the whole it was a lot of fun to read.Unfortunately, that same fun storyline was mangled and then dropped by the anime writers. Now, instead of centering on the K-Fights and high school life, it focuses on an interdimensional adventure that doesn't play out. Ryoko is perfect as a fighter, but it is difficult to see the slightly conceited, sword-wielding samurai beauty as fighting dragons and talking to princesses. And there is not even any background given on why this dimension and its ruler need her help.Then another new character comes in, and OF COURSE he knows all about this other dimension, the fight with the dragon, and the talk with the princess. I have one question--who is he, and how does he know all that? The fight with the dragon was a private affair with Ryoko, the dragon, and the princess. So where was he? *sighs* This is yet another thing in this new storyline that doesn't mesh.On the other hand, the characters are wonderful. Ryoko is my favorite, with her rival Azumi following in an extremely close second. Both girls are awesome fighters, and really fun characters. Shizuma didn't get much of a chance to shine here, but from what I can tell he is exactly the same as he was in the manga. The reporter is still a creepy little stalker with a thing for Ryoko, although his English voice actor is the person who played Tai from Digimon (its impossible for me to watch RBHS without thinking--&quot;Hey, that's Tai!&quot;) And just like in the manga, Ryoko's best friend is kicked out of the picture by the arrival of Shizuma.The art is beautiful. Colors are bright and easy to look at, and the movement could not be smoother. The fight scenes are the only reason I watch this dvd anymore--those scenes are wicked cool! So there is one redeeming factor.The voice acting is great in both versions. I think the English is better. The girls are not high and squeaky, and there is a wider range of emotions. In fact, I find their voices rather soothing.I feel I should mention that my computer's dvd player has a problem with this dvd, making the soundtrack skip and jump. This is very disconcerting for a dvd.Although I like the voices, the art, and the characters, I still don't like this anime, mainly because of the warped storyline. It has been more than a year since I have watched this, and I don't think I'll be watching it again anytime soon.",Real Bout High School: Enter the Samurai Girl - Volume 1
1041471,"***1/2Like many a successful comic before him, Will Ferrell goes for his own ""Truman Show""-like bid at legitimacy with ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" a high concept comedy/drama, written by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Foster, about a man who discovers that he's actually a fictional character in an author's yet unfinished novel.Harold Crick is a straight-arrow, stuffed-shirt IRS agent who lives a life of highly regimented solitude completely cut off from any real social interaction with the people around him.  One day he begins hearing the voice of an unidentified woman portentously intoning the details of each of his actions as he goes about the business of living out his daily life.  As it turns out, the voice belongs to Kay Eiffel, a neurotic, reclusive novelist who is suffering from severe writer's block as she attempts to complete her latest work of literary fiction.  Blissfully unaware that the character she has created has actually taken form as a flesh-and-blood human being, Eiffel plots ways to kill him off in the final scene.  When Harold finally figures out what is happening to him, he seeks advice from a local English professor (Dustin Hoffman) who comes to believe Harold's bizarre predicament and tries to help him avoid his preordained fate before it's too late.Highly reminiscent of such reality-bending movies as ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" among others, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" earns points for pushing the envelope in terms of storytelling, but its themes - of a man finding meaning in his humdrum existence and of an author realizing that preserving real life is more important than preserving art - are so retrograde and shopworn at this late date that the movie comes across as far less cutting-edge and innovative than its post-modernist premise would lead one to expect.  There are some very sharp and amusing moments in the film, but often we feel as if the movie's creators found themselves at a loss as to what to do with the clever idea once they came up with it.  In short, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" feels more like an outline for a movie than a fully worked-out film in its own right.Nevertheless, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is worth seeing for the low-keyed performance by Farrell who never steps out of character as the socially backward but essentially warmhearted schnook Eiffel has invented for her printed page.  The resplendent Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the tax-cheating ultra-liberal storeowner whom Harold is sent to audit and who opens his eyes to the possibility of true love for the first time in his ""life.""  Their scenes together are genuinely well-played, touching and romantic.  With her stiff-upper-lip British accent and crisp enunciation, Thompson is perfect as the frazzled narrator and author desperate to break through her writer's block and bring closure to her literary creation.  Queen Latifah effectively underplays the role of the rational assistant sent to help Eiffel find a way to kill off her character, while Hoffman, in a wonderfully playful mood, gets to deliver most of the screenplay's funniest lines.There's a great deal of poignancy in the final act as Eiffel has to decide between literally killing off her creation to preserve her work or letting her creation live even if that means spoiling a potential literary masterpiece.  It is at this moment that Eiffel learns the true burden of being God - or at least the demi-god that artists automatically become through the nature of their work. It's a shame that the movie slouches along for so much of its running time on its way to the finale.",N/A

1177666,"This rudely rambunctious, intermittently funny 2008 holiday comedy is a supreme case of Hollywood overkill along the lines of Jay Roach'sMeet the Fockers. Running a scant 89 minutes, it stars no less than five Oscar-winning actors in the standard cookie-cutter story of a commitment-phobic couple who are forced to visit each of their four divorced parents on Christmas day. Co-written by first-timers Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson, along with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who co-wroteThe Hangover), the premise shows promise with Kate and Brad, a pair of self-satisfied, upwardly mobile San Franciscans meeting for what looks like the first time in a bar. Their sharp-tongued banter turns out to be a role-playing fantasy since they are three years into their comfortable relationship. A major fog blanket over the city ruins their plans for a holiday vacation in Fiji. What's worse is that they are caught by a local news camera at the airport. Because they deceived their families into thinking they were traveling overseas to help starving third-world children, they embark on a daylong journey to each of their parent's houses, all conveniently located in the Bay Area.However, the movie starts to decline precipitously with each visit. The first home the couple drops by belongs to Brad's redneck father, where his other sons, cage-fighting brothers Denver and Dallas tackle Brad with painful wrestling moves. It ends with an uncomfortable gift exchange where Brad's expensive gifts humiliate his blue-collar family. The couple then visits Kate's overly affectionate mother and a den of cougars, an episode in which it is revealed Kate had a childhood weight problem and a possible lesbian past. Brad's therapist mother is next on the itinerary, but he's still angry that she married his best friend, who is half her age, and a game of Taboo reveals the communication gulf that really exists between Kate and Brad. The last stop is at the home of Kate's father, and this is where the tone gets serious-minded as the couple learns a lesson in the value of being with family in spite of whatever personal differences may exist to divide them the rest of the year.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon - he with his semi-improvised riffing, she with her exacting intelligence - would seem to be absurdly mismatched, but they spar convincingly, even if they do look more like best friends than lovers. Vaughn gets to shine in a Christmas pageant scene where he basks in the limelight of his ham-fisted stage debut. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight play the parents with little screen time, and only Duvall leaves much of an impression as an embittered shell of a man. Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Carol Kane, and Kristin Chenoweth gamely play various relatives in equally smallish roles. The whole venture is directed by Seth Gordon, whose only previous feature-length credit is the critically praised video-game documentary,The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, and his storytelling inexperience shows in the sometimes ADD-level pacing of the story. The 2009 DVD, being released for the holidays, doesn't offer much in terms of extras other two different screen formats.",Four Christmases (DVD)
442212,"A true Cinemascope film, hopefully the DVD release by Fox (unlike the VHS version) will actually be letterboxed in the correct ratio as stated in the above product details.  You couldn't find a more obvious example of 'pan and scan' editing than the scene where David Hedison is dodging the lunging dinosaur while climbing the rock wall (he hugs the wall, dinosaur's head pops into view, pops out of view, back to Hedison, then to dinosaur, pops back into view, etc.) As to the movie itself, though a childhood favorite (I must have seen it 25 times between the theater and on TV) it promises more than it delivers. When you're 12 years old looking for adventure involving dinosaurs, this filled the bill, even though you knew that they weren't like the dinosaurs in your playset, books or King Kong.  It was big and colorful.  That probably won't be good enough for today's kids; the big won't be there on the small screen and color is taken for granted.  And no CGI.

871245,"To enjoy the Chinese-French film `Purple Butterfly,' some patience is required. To follow the story was hard for me (and I am a Japanese who knows the historical background of the film), but once you understand what is going on, you see the merits of this period romance. First, remember the following four characters.Zhang Ziyi is Ding Hui/Cynthia, a Chinese girl whose brother is a member of one underground organization protesting against the Japanese invasion. The time is set in 1928, and the place is northern China, then called Manchuria. But one tragic thing happens to her brother, and she is also drawn into the activity of the organization.Toru Nakamura, Japanese actor, plays Itami a Japanese whose father works as an interpreter in China. But young Itami must leave this country and his love Cynthia because he was drafted into the military service by the Japanese army. Three years later, Itami comes back to Shanghai as Japanese military officer, who had been trained for espionage in China. Now Itami meets Cynthia again in this city, but this time Cynthia's love seems to have a hidden agenda for she is meetig her new lover Xie Ming (Yuanzheng Feng).In addition to the main story above, there is a sub-plot. Lie Ye (`Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress') plays Situ, a young, ordinary Chinese man. He and Yiling (Bingbing Li) are innocent sweethearts, but when Situ is mistaken for someone else at the crowded station, a tragic thing happens.[Noir in China] The fates of the characters are closely intertwined with the film's complicated plot. This film can be called a romance, but it would be more correct to call it a noir film. The images themselves are beautiful, and the production designs are realistic, but the murky photography and the shaky camera may not be your taste. Though there are shooting scenes, and you can see Zhang Ziyi shooting a gun - far cry from the image we associate with her (oh, and let's forget `Rush Hour 2,' shall we?) - the sequences are sometimes confusing, and probably that is one of the reasons for the general complaint about the film.Whatever your reaction may be, the film proves that Zhang Ziyi is an immensely gifted actress, but I am not sure if her acting here is her best. But to me, though the time allotted to her character was not long enough, Bingbing Li as young telephone operator is more impressive. There is one brief but memorable scene, in which Bingbing Li quietly sits in a streetcar as if unaware of the riotous street outside. The contrast between the two worlds is represented in this short sequence, and in the middle of the battles and the deaths there is a woman who is clearly in love. Bingning Li literally becomes the image of love, which is too fragile in the time of war.Writer/Director Lou Ye succeeds in creating such remarkable sequences resonant with the film's serious themes, but the jumbling of the time order and the confusing relations between the characters often do harm to them. `Purple Butterfly' is for the viewers who can be patient with the slow-moving and complicated story. It will be rewarding experience only after you put the pieces in the right places.",N/A
187700,"Jules and Jim is an imprenetrably emotional film full of superficial characters and a plot that never stops to take a breath, but this could possibly be everything erratic director Francois Truffaut intended. Despite some pleasent performances, nice cinematography, inventive editing and camera movement, the film just never comes together. It's incredibly fast moving story unfolds in such a jerky fashion it's hardly enjoyable. The film can be seen as either a reality based love triangle, or a fairy tale, but either way you look at it, it doesn't work. It's the type of film you see because of it's reputation, and sparse innovation, other than that, Jules and Jim is an irregular mess that's easily forgettable.",N/A

However true love,  strength of character, and willingness to forgive and be forgiven win in  the end.Overall, a good story.

638682,"I loved the books as a kid and enjoyed the BBC series. This movie tried so hard to be liked, like a puppy prancing around frantically licking everyone in sight. Yet for all its sincerity and studied silliness, the end result left me feeling distanced from the source material, which never felt as self conscious as this labored effort.That being said, it looked great. But that wasn't enough to offset this well intentioned but ragged script, which I am certain that involved as he was, Adams would've adjusted as the dailies rolled in. That is, if he had lived long enough to see it through.I'm giving it three stars for good intentions and for moments of greatness. But I still think that primitive as it was technically, the BBS production came closer to the spirit of the books and on the whole was a more satisfying Hitchhiker's experience.Since the above review, I have viewed this film for a second time and had a much more favorable impression. Actually, it was really quite good, all in all.  This was a difficult undertaking, as the book was episodic and really didn't have a coherent plot. The writers (including Adams) were obviously trying to make it more cinematic by attempting to give it a story arc that wasn't even in the source material. The end result really is quite satisfying as long as one tries not to compare it to the other mediums it has appeared in.Still, rather than the unequivocally enjoyable Hitchiker's Guide I was longing for,  the best I can muster beyond the occasional moments of brilliance of which there are many) is that it's ""mostly harmless"".",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

The movie moves back and forth between Alice's childhood and old age, as she remembers the past, but then it also moves into fantasies which feature the creations from Jim Henson.  BTW, these are not cute little muppets.  Some of the Henson creatures are characters from Alice in Wonderland, others are dark characters from Alice's fantasies.  The problem is, the film sidesteps the questions about Dodgson's relationships with young girls and is mostly fiction.

1126768,"*Just a heads up, Spoilers ahead*I just got finished watching ""The Mist"" and am not sure what to think. I guess I'll figure it out by the end of the review. The story is centered around a small town community that undergoes a big storm leaving the townspeople in a panic. As they all head to a small local grocery store a strange mist comes upon the entire area. Those in the store are warned by an olderman that there is something in the mist that killed one of his friends. He urges for everyone to stay inside but there are always a few hard headed folks that just won't listen. As they go into the mist they quickly disappear leaving only a terrified scream behind.As the story moves forward we begin to see some interesting creatures. I was impressed by the visuals with the creatures being very different then what you usually see in these type films. At this point we have a few battles that all take place inside the grocery store once some of the creatures get inside. Besides fighting off creatures they also have to deal with an overly preachy townswoman that I was begging to see killed off. She will drive you to the brink of insaity, trust me. The film then begins to turn more toward showing how humanity deals with life threatening situations by turning on each other. I could have done without this idea. I really just want to watch a fun film without having to see someones opinions rolled into it. I feel it also made the film drag on. There was a bit too much focus on this topic.I'm not going to give the ending away but will say that it is very morbid. It definately wasn't the ending I was expecting. However I will give it credit since it was different from a mainstream hollywood ending. So overall I thought it was decent just way too long. It could have been wrapped up much quicker.

819421,"...that title remains with Unforgiven.Mystic river is a good movie, not a great one. It has a great story and great characters - with a good screenplay by Brian Helgeland, based on Dennis Lehane's book. The directing is solid, while not really bringing anything special to the film, yet pacing it prefectly in building the tension around the murder.What is outstanding about this film is the acting. Sean Penn gives yet another inspired performance as a working class father from Boston who just lost his oldest daughter to a horrific murder. Although the scenes that most people seem to remember (and that are shown in the trailer) show his *exaggerated* response to his daughter's death, the rest of the performance is more subdued and restrained.Tim Robbins' performance is also of note, as Penn's disturbed boyhood friend who shows up covered in blood the same night of the murder, making his frightened wife (Marcia Gay Harden) start to doubt his story and to believe that he is in fact the murderer.The rest of the cast give solid performances in somewhat limited characters, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne as the cops asigned to the case, and Laura Linney as Penn's second wife.However, there are a few things about the film that rubbed me the wrong way; the whole sub-plot about Bacon's wife calling him on his cell phone and not speaking? What was that suppossed to bring to the movie? Or Linney's (apparently) sudden transformation into Lady MacBeth, telling Penn's character that he should do whatever needed to be done? Or the final parade scene?In short, while not a great film (certainly not Eastwood's best), it's a good one worth catching, and not as bad as some other reviewers will have you believe (certainly not Mistake River!).",N/A

Agnes Bruckner, Trevor Wright and Arjay Smithplay are the hapless travelers from a big city, who choose the wrong place to rest for the night.About 10 or 15 minutes in, ""Vacancy 2: The First Cut"" shows us what kind of ""business"" the motel owner Gordon (David Moscow) and his partner are really engaged in. This deprives the film of urban legend-like mystery and suspense considerably, though there are still a few twists and turns in the storyline.All in all the film is watchable with nice photography and production designs.

He's reduced to observing the nuns and kids with detached amusement and staying out of the way.

274940,"I realize that I am in the minority here, but I have never much cared for the movie 2001. Granted there are some breathtaking picturesque scenes and the score is one cinema's great masterpieces, not to mention the grand special effects (tame by today's standards, but that was in 1968). However, the movie dragged on forever and the plot was paper thin. There was a great deal in the movie that made no sense whatsoever. 2001 was like trying to eat plastic food; it looks really nice, but it serves no function except decoration.Happily 2010 is not like that. The movie is very much plot driven (as movies should be) and is far more enjoyable to watch than it's predecessor. Roy Scheider is always a joy to watch and it's interesting to see John Lithgow in a ""regular Joe"" role instead of the quirky parts he usually plays. The movie not only has a decent plot of it's own, but it answers many of the questions that 2001 left unanswered: What happened to Dave Bowman; why did HAL go berserk; what are those monoliths near Jupiter doing.The film never reaches the artistic achievements of 2001. However, movies should be more than just about art and 2010 succeeds where 2001 failed.",2010: The Year We Make Contact VHS

I expected the same from Voodoo Moon, but surprisingly it's not a total crud-fest like I had expected it to be.  Eric Mabius (Resident Evil) and Buffy and Angel's Charisma Carpenter star as siblings with tragic pasts, that soon find themselves holed up with a few other people as demonic forces threathen them.  Predictable to the extreme, Voodoo Moon is surprisingly enjoyable for what it is, with Mabius being a surprisingly decent hero, and Carpenter looking as beautiful as ever, though her comedic talents which Buffy and Angel fans know by heart, don't get to be put on display.  The action scenes are mostly decent, and the rest of the cast, including Re-Animator icon Jeffrey Combs and the Howling's Dee Wallace, are good as well.  All in all, if you're looking for an enjoyable B-movie romp that doesn't take itself super seriously, check out Voodoo Moon.",Voodoo Moon

And upon inspection of the credits etc.. and saw it was made in 1984! The cover made it look like a modern day movie, but i'm glad i finally go tto see it.Top secret is typical Zucker/Abraham humour like there other films, Airplane(flying high), Naked Gun & Kentucky Fried Movie. This one however may not be the funniest movie they have done, but it is the funniest movie about a rocker from America who goes to Germany to be the first ever rocker allowed to perform in the country, but ends up tangled up with a woman who is the head of the underground rebellion and there misshap adventures continue from there.What I really liked about the film was how it was shot in 84, yet it looks like a huge hollywood blockbuster from the 50's or 60's. Huge stages and looks very 'classic' in it's appearence. It really is a wonderull job in shooting it and the scenery and backgrounds are very nice... and thats coming from someone who never gives a s#!~ abou tthat kind of stuff!!!!

They say it's 'cause you can fast forward the slow bits and get to the interesting part and watch a 30 minute movie... nah, i thought it paced ok, so i dunno what there on about it. it probably just went up against something else that took all the focus off this one.Overall, it's a great film for what it is.

Gary Cooper & Helen Hayes were great actors even back in 1932. They are the best part of the movie. One of Hemmingway's best novels, did not make a good transition. I'm not sure he knew Cooper personally at this time but did pick him for the role of Lt. Henry. They were close afterwards. Hemmingway didn't like the movie much. I don't remember seeing Helen Hayes very often, her being a stage actress. She is wonderful & gorgeous as Katherine & may have loved Cooper for real as lots of his leading ladies did. If she didn't, that's good acting. It is war & theirs is a really hot, sexual love affair. The war intervenes & separates them. The battle scenes & the montages of Lt. Henry's search through Italy for Catherine was a mess. Were all the scenes shot at night? That made it rather tedious. Adolphe Menjou had a meaty role as Major Rinaldi, Lt.

I didn't.It's a handsome production...perhaps too handsome. The buildings and streets all look very quaint and clean and just so &quot;perfect&quot;. The 1984 production with George C. Scott was much grittier and darker and really created a sense of atmosphere.All of the supporting actors are decent in this most recent version, but not particularly memorable. For instance, the actor portraying Jacob Marley in the Stewart version has nothing on Frank Finlay, who was so chilling as Marley in 1984!I hate to say it, but Patrick Stewart is a very inadequate Scrooge. I know Scrooge is supposed to be a hard man in the beginning of the story, but Stewart is so stoic that you simply can't read anything from his expressionless face throughout most of the film, whereas all other actor's who have played the famous Dickens' character have been able to convey the appropriate bitterness or sadness that inhabits Scrooge.One particular choice Stewart makes is dead wrong: When Scrooge visits the &quot;Chrismas yet to come&quot;, he begins to realize that he is the dead man everyone's talking about BEFORE he sees his name on the tombstone. It's only when he sees his name that he fully comes to terms with his impending death...Every other actor who has portrayed Scrooge has understood this, but Stewart plays the scene as if he had no idea that he was the dead person UNTIL he reads his name on the stone! This choice is wrong because it ultimately makes Scrooge look as if he doesn't truly change his ways until that very moment...when Scrooge's transformation should occur slowly with every spirit's visit!I respect Patrick Stewart, but with his performance in A Christmas Carol, he demonstrates why he's no Alistair Sim, Albert Finney, George C.

1570576,"CONCEPT: There's a winter storm that has grounded virtually every flight out of England. Except one. A handful of people -- a miserable drunk, a lecherous couple, a foul-mouthed mob boss and his two bodyguards, two unhinged army dudes, a religious leader, a woman on vacation, and an elderly gentleman escorting a precious cargo (among others) -- are allowed onto the only flight that is able to make it ahead of the storm. However, once they are airborne (we have movie title!), it turns out that the storm is the least of their concerns.It turns out that a lot of hazards await our passengers. The way they are laid out for the audience, they all come across as a little unclear and a lot silly. I mean, I could explain them for you pretty clearly, but the movie is less interested in back story and exposition than it is in trying to establish an atmosphere of uncertainty and chaos. After all, in a mid-air plane, those are the things that create the most suspense and fear. Unfortunately, the movie's characters are so formulaic that they seem far too at home in their roles, and whatever atmosphere of uncertainty there should be is lost in predictable shenanigans.This is not to say that the movie doesn't try to push its way past predictability. A barely recognizable Mark Hamill (yes, Luke Skywalker) is by far the best player in this drama as an air traffic head honcho on his very last day of duty. His role seems pretty thankless at the start of the film, but he pulls his own by the time the hard rock credits roll. I guessed most of the film's twists up to (and including) the final scene, but although they were, alone, fairly derivative, their intertwining at the conclusion was something I haven't seen before. In other words, the film was like a horror movie you've seen before mixed with a thriller you've seen before. Neither one was particularly unique, but at least I can say I've never watched them both at the same time.If the script or characters had gone beyond mere caricature, there might be something here to stick with you past the last kernel of popcorn in your bucket. As it is, this is a not particularly bad or good little mix-em-up (definitely not horror, no matter what the trailers or movie poster might suggest) that barely lasts longer than its final scene. It'll make you feel smarter because it's so easy to predict, but there's little doubt it'll leave enough of an impression for you to feel like recommending it to your friends.",N/A

Also if you're only seeing the show on Bravo you are missing out. I have seen two Bravo eps and I cringed at the bad dubbing and editing.

""Nothing's what it seems to be...Life is just a dream, etc.""  With some sex and nudity thrown in.I read the book when it first came out and was entranced by it!  'Don't think I've ever seen the film till now...if I did, it didn't make much of an impression on me.  I found the beginning to be quite interesting.  Michael Caine plays the callow but possibly-talented underachiever very well.  Anna Karina is beautiful and gives her usual soulful performance.  Anthony Quinn is perfect for his role, which is more of a type than an actual person.  Candace Bergen looks good  and her rather wooden style of acting is ok for this part.The story is really interesting and I have the feeling that (again, to quote another reviewer) it could have been a wonderful film.  What that would have taken I don't know.  Perhaps it's presented in too literal a style for a tale that is about not taking things so literally?  I'm not sure, but whatever it would take, this version didn't deliver it.We are presented with one version of ""reality"" after another.  Just when we think that the previous versions were not real and the present one is, then another skin of the onion is peeled off and we are perplexed again.  The problem I had was that I just lost interest in the whole game way before the conclusion.The ideas presented are worthy of thought.  I particularly liked what Anne, the French stewardess, told Niko, that there was something in the core of everyone that has never been touched by anything horrible.  This is pure Course in Miracles and I was happy to see it mentioned here.  It is certainly meritorious to see the callow Niko come to terms with his past behavior, but I wasn't really convinced that he actually changed.  The ideas are bogged down by so much hokey ""magic"" and visual shlock that I could no longer care what the heck was going on.

It would have been great to be included in the film. While I don't have kids of my own to be my test viewers, I can only think on face value.  Producer Michael Phillips (E.T.) also worked on the popular nostalgic films of The Sting and Cannery Row with David S. Ward.  His tendency to over-produce and add too many new ingredients repeats in Mimzy. Robert Shaye was an unusual choice for a director with only one previous film among his credits. So, two producers are deciding where the final film will go.  The special effects were overdone and the music often repetitive, but the children's parts were well cast even though a bit too young for so many stressful and demanding situations. Alien fiction can also do without the cliches of bright lights and superior races that always let themselves be discovered by the F.B.I.(Why were they so superior if they let their presence leak out by causing a power failure?) There are plenty of trivia, video games and puzzles on the extra menu that kids might enjoy.

1549971,"""Nobody lives Forever"" is a 1946 black and white romantic crime drama starring John Garfield, Walter Brennan, and Geraldine Fitzgerald with George Tobias, George Coulouris, and Faye Emerson. Based on an original screenplay by famed crime writer W.R.Burnett (""Little Caesar"", ""Beast of the City"", ""High Sierra"", ""This Gun for Hire"", ""Asphalt Jungle"", Scarface"") the story centers on a group of grifters, one of whom (Garfield) fall in love with his mark (Fitzgerald), much to the dismay of his fellow gangsters (Coulouris).Ruggedly handsome John Garfield (1913-52) was the original ""method"" actor. Garfield made his screen debut in 1938 in ""Four Daughters"" for which he received his first Best Supporting  Actor nomination. One year later ""They Made me a Criminal"" propelled him into the A list. He's best known for ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946). Blacklisted in the communist scare of the early 50s, his career was cut short, and he died in 1952 at age 39. This film comes at the height of his popularity and it was his chance to show a wider range of acting skill, which he does.Beautiful Geraldine Fitzgerald (1913-2005) plays the rich widow whom Garfield intends to fleece. She's best known for her Oscar nominated role in ""Wuthering Heights"" (1939)Walter Brennan (1894-1974) plays Garfield's old friend. Brennan won 3 Oscars for Best Supporting Actor  -""Come and Get it"" (1936), ""Kentucky"" (1938), and ""The Westerner"" (1941) - and was nominated for his work in ""Sergeant York"" (1941). We know him best for his Emmy nominated role in the TV series ""The Real McCoys"", and his film comedies (""The Over the Hill Gang"") or as the grumpy side kick Stumpy in ""Rio Bravo"", but he was equally capable of playing the villain, as he showed in ""The Westerner"" (1940), ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and again In ""How the West Was Won"" (1962).George Tobias (1901-1980) plays the comic relief sidekick. He appeared in more than 50 films including ""The Strawberry Blonde"" (1941), ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (1942), and ""Passage to Marseille"" (1944). Like many other film actors, he transitioned to TV in the 50s and is best remembered for his comedy as the witch Samantha's neighbor Abner on ""Bewitched"" (1964-71).Glamorous Faye Emerson (1917-1983) achieved her fame on TV in the 50s, but she had an active film career and worked with Garfield in films like ""Between Two Worlds"" (1944) and ""Out of the Fog"" (1941). She plays Garfield's ex-girlfriend.This was the fifth film for director Jean Negulesco (1900-93) who went on to earn an Oscar nomination for ""Johnny Belinda"" (1955) and win a BAFTA for ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" (1959). He specialized in films that take place in Europe (""Three Coins in a Fountain"", ""Boy on a Dolphin"", ""Britannia Mews"") and also was known for his atmospheric use of the camera - neither of which are present here.The film is often referred to as ""film noir"" which it clearly isn't. There is no femme fatale (although Emerson's role had the potential) and there is no downbeat ending. The big city backdrop is substituted for the beaches of Malibu, and the sunshine replaces the dark rainy street scenes.Bottom line - an OK film from the mid 40s, with a good performance from John Garfield.",N/A

The subject doesn't even get touched in the movie.  Aside from that, I thought the movie was very good.  Casting Jeremy Renner as Dahmer was a good call.  He's attractive in a understated way just as Dahmer was.  He potrays the quiet, mousy, friendly, and semi-normal personallity that Dahmer was said to have.

577485,"Contrary to many views, this is not similar to Usual Suspects. In the latter film, a man concocted a story based on information he was viewing the entire time of the police interrogation.  Here, while there is, similarly, an interrogation, the man being interrogated is not viewing anything at all. A more important difference has to do with the psychological basis for the events that unfold in the two different stories.Whether or not the suspect here is concocting a story should not be revealed for fear of spoiling the premise of this work--which is a real paradox.  Why?While the acting here is superior--especially Hugo Weaving in the role of the man under investigation--and the premise is gripping, ultimately the rationale for the events that unfold in the police station is shown to be too banal to support the powerful theme of the story.A critical difference between the two films is that The Usual Suspects involves a spectrum of shady characters in the criminal milieu, while The Interview focuses on just one.  This is important, because the opportunity for multi-layered interaction (among the criminal bunch) in Usual Suspects is present and handled very well.  Here, the interaction is strictly between the suspect and the police.  With that kind of restricted focus, there would have to be a much greater emphasis on the psychology of the two sides.  While that is true to some extent, because this film ultimately emphasizes procedural error, the entire psychological basis is trivialized--in essence, destroyed.The trivialization and virtual elimination of the psychological basis for the mental battle between the two sides itself makes the film much less than what it could and should have been.  This is really too bad, because there are some fascinating sequences.  The very last scene of the suspect alone could have been a great ending, if the focus on procedural error had been replaced by something more subtle.  As it is, this is a noble and failed effort.",The Interview
827624,"In early 2004 I saw Takeshi Kitano's ZATOICHI in the local cinema, intrigued by a Japanese feature but knowing nothing of the long tradition of films with Zatoichi, the blind swordsman. I never did see the earlier films with Shintaro Katsu, but I continue to enjoy Takeshi Kitano's take on the character. The plot is fairly basic, rival gangs are fighting for control of a small town, and the locals are obliged to pay increasing amounts protection money. Into this steps Zatoichi, played by Takeshi himself, as well as another itinerant swordsman who seeks to do the dirty work of one of the gangs in order to help his sick wife. Zatoichi falls in with a poor farmer, as do two geishas who are traveling about to get revenge on the gang members who killed their parents. Over the course of the films, Zatoichi proceeds to slay an enormous amount of people, with some vivid CGI blood painted over each fatal sword blow. In spite of the generic setup, the production values and a few of the twists in the story make this an enjoyable film.I know that Takeshi has been criticized for completely doing away with the back story around Zatoichi. Here the only sign that he has a past at all is when a gang member says, ""Could this blind man be Zatoichi"", and a flashback where he silently kills a group of nameless foes. Instead, Takeshi brings the character between the two extremes of charming, but taciturn, old blind man and unstoppable killing machine. But nonetheless, I like how universal the Zatoichi character is, even when he is as mechanical as Kitano sometimes makes him. The archetype of the man of piercing intelligence who fains disability or madness appears in Western art from Hamlet to Russian holy fools, so all audiences will respond to Zatoichi. And sure, the action is sometimes hard to believe, but Takeshi knows this and has injected a level of grim humour into the film.My only complaint about the film's action is that the final battle between Zatoichi and the bodyguard is anticlimactic. After building up the polarity between them for over an hour, there could have been more to it than a single blow. In addition, the soundtrack strikes me as exceedingly lame until the nice taiko drumming that closes the film.I cannot comment on SONATINE, as in my market the two films were not released together.",N/A
1358807,"""She-Ra"" was really just ""He-Man"" with the genders reversed.  Still, it spoke to me back in my junior high days.  My little sister especially loved the show.  This episode was told in flashback.  It's basically the introduction of Castaspella.The more I watch the Smurfs, She-Ra, and other cartoons, the more I realize how derivative they are.  The evil queen in this episode was like the one in Disney's Snow White.  Her hair was covered and she had a seductive look.  Like the Witch in the Wizard of Oz, water played a role in her downfall.  Castaspella is like a reversal of the evil queen in Snow White.  That queen went from a vamp to an old peddler woman of her own free will.  Castaspella starts off as an old woman cursed by the queen and then becomes pretty and young.For people interested in She-Ra toys, it turns out that the Castaspella on TV look different from the doll.  On TV, her colors are blue and yellow.  The doll has shades of yellow.  The toy has a sunlike aura on her torso's back.  Castaspella on TV never has a glow or glimmer behind her.Like many a cartoon, here good conquers evil.  This came out long before the Shrek series, but this episode has that same message of not judging a book by its cover.",N/A

1020186,"The Golden Globes are over and their new Animation Category has been added (2007). And anyone who thought MONSTER HOUSE had even a remote shot at winning this award must've been smoking crack. Up against HAPPY FEET and the awesomely entertaining CARS, Monster House was the lemon in the animation ranks. Even though the animation was good (actually these things are more a cartoonish CGI than animation), the story missed by a mile.More interesting than the story itself was the manner in which it was made. On the extra features of the DVD it shows how small, electronic balls were attached to actors as they read their lines and acted out the parts, allowing the CGI animators the ability to track every facial twitch and finger movement, thus making the animated characters move in a more life-like fashion.I don't usually mention the MPAA ratings of films, but here I'm going to make an exception because this supposedly kid-friendly film is rated PG, not G. My guess is that the violence and the one off-comment about female anatomy (""Oh. So it's a girl house."") forced this rating on the film (just something for those stickler parents to be aware of, although I'd be willing to bet your little kiddies get more information from the Victoria Secrets catalogue in your monthly mail and more bloody viewing on the nightly news).The story is about a dank house on a quiet street. This house is inhabited by a crazy old coot named Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) who guards his property with rabid ferocity. Any toys that end up on his lawn are immediately confiscated and never seen again. Across the street from Mr. Nebbercracker lives D.J. (Mitchel Musso). He's infatuated with the dark and dreary house, and spies on it via a telescope from his upstairs bedroom window. And when D.J.'s parents head out for the weekend and put a babysitter in charge of D.J., things start to get interesting. The babysitter's boyfriend vanishes, and D.J. instigates an argument with old man Nebbercracker, only to have the crotchety man fall over with an apparent heart attack. An ambulance takes Nebbercracker away and the house now sits vacant on the verge of Halloween eve.D.J.'s best friend, Chowder, comes over, too, and when D.J. tells Chowder about the strange goings on at the vacant house, Chowder doesn't believe him and decides to play doorbell ditch. But when he rings the bell, the house comes alive! The spirit of ...something lives in its walls.As the boys try and figure out what's going on, they also encounter an entrepreneurial young cookie sales-girl named Jenny whom both boys become somewhat enraptured with; Chowder and D.J. are, after all (so we're told), approaching puberty.Initially the boys and Jenny think that old man Nebbercracker is dead, but his unexpected return changes everything they once thought they knew about the old, scarey house.Although loaded with plenty of action, scarey scenes, and funny buddy dialogue, the story is simply not up to par. The fact that D.J. is approaching puberty has nothing to do with the story's end result and is given way too much emphasis throughout. The babysitter (Maggie Gyllenhaal) also has little to do with the story and appears more as filler than anything else.Even so, the animation is interesting and the action will keep most viewers watching. Just don't expect Happy Feet or Cars and you'll probably do just fine with Monster House.",N/A

1247934,"I watched Iron Man 1 two nights ago and Iron Man 2 last night with my two teenage boys. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 but didn't find Iron Man 2 as good. I did like the special effects though and found Robert Downey Jr. even better.In Iron Man 1, Downey plays Tony Stark, the owner of a company which builds weapons. He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying. He uses this magnet in an invention, an ""Iron Man suit"", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them. When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool. Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 because of the great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars.In Iron Man 2, Stark has now disclosed to the public that he is Iron Man and the fame has gone a bit to his head. The government wants his 'weapon', his board loses confidence in him, his friends become increasingly annoyed with his behaviour, and the magnet in his chest is poisoning him to death. Paltrow is back as his assistant, Pepper, but I don't like her character as much in this one; too harsh. and Downey of course is back as Tony Stark. But in this movie, Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as his military friend. I like Cheadle but much preferred Howard. Samuel Jackson is great as usual as is Mickey Rourke who plays the villain, but Scarlett Johanssen's character was boring and very unrealistic (yes, even for a super-hero movie).I did enjoy the background about Stark's family and father, especially when he discovers a message left to him by his father which can save his life. And Robert Downey's character is even more enjoyable in this one ie wittier, more sarcastic, more foibles.So, my conclusion is that it is still worth watching though not as good as the first. A good family movie though and funny.",N/A

1537990,"American author John Jakes is sometimes referred to as &#8220;the godfather of the historical novel.&#8221; During his prolific career he took time away from historical subjects to write a series of novellas for &#8220;The Man From UNCLE&#8221; magazine, which provided his first tenuous link to television. However, it is for period novels and the subsequent small screen adaptations of his work &#8212; namely the &#8220;North & South&#8221; series as well as the series under review &#8212; that he is best known.Around 1976, during the American bicentennial, Jakes wrote a series of eight novels collectively entitled &#8220;The Kent Family Chronicles&#8221;. The first three novels in this series, &#8220;The Bastard&#8221;, &#8220;The Rebels&#8221;, and &#8220;The Seekers&#8221; were adapted for television at the height of the mini-series craze in the 1970s and &#8217;80s. These adaptations are a curious addition to the Acorn Media library.The typical American mini-series produced at this time tended towards panoramic, epic, multi-generational stories that afforded opportunities for casting multiple stars for maximum viewer satisfaction. At best, in a series like &#8220;Centennial&#8221; (another frontier saga made around the same time and based on the James Michener blockbuster), or either of the Herman Wouk-penned WWII-era volumes &#8220;The Winds of War&#8221; and &#8220;War & Remembrance&#8221;, the mini-series reached the heights of artistic achievement within this popular limited format. Attracting such luminaries as Robert Mitchum (in the two Wouk works), the television mini-series is generally fun to watch just to see how many stars have been assembled under one roof.This is both a blessing and a curse, as popularity with viewers doesn&#8217;t always translate into a believable performance, particularly in a period piece. This &#8220;stunt casting&#8221; (or is that mis-casting) works against the overall effectiveness of THE KENT CHRONICLES. While this point might be belaboured, one has only to cite the example of Tom Bosley as Benjamin Franklin and the point is easily made. Bosley was a good actor with numerous stage credits in a variety of roles, but he will always be remembered as Mr. C on &#8220;Happy Days&#8221;, thus rendering his believability in a period piece, let alone as one of history&#8217;s most recognizable figures, ludicrous. And then there&#8217;s Don Johnson&#8230; but I&#8217;ve already said ludicrous, so enough about the casting.A good mini-series stands or falls on the strength of its story and Jakes truly knows how to tell a tale. &#8220;The Bastard&#8221;, the first three hours of this nine hour trilogy, sets things up with the very clever metaphor of the main character&#8217;s dilemma (he is a bastard, meaning an illegitimate son) and the idea that America at the time of its quest for independence was a sort of bastard child of Great Britain. As Philippe Charbonneau (Andrew Stevens) &#8212; later known as Philip Kent &#8212; seeks to understand his circumstances and purpose in life, so the burgeoning country that became the United States of America experiences its own birth pangs and subsequent self-identification.Peppered with performances from a high-profile cast that range from brilliant to atrocious, the viewer has fun &#8220;spotting the star&#8221; while watching each chapter of the story unfold. It just takes a little extra effort to not lose sight of the reason the big-name actor is supposed to be there &#8211; to further the plot.The real surprise here is that while there is considerable merit on display &#8212; it is a very entertaining story after all &#8212; it suffers by comparison to almost anything else in the mini-series market that Acorn Media has distributed. After all, Acorn specializes in British programming, and while the production standards in British programs may suffer by comparison due to budget limitations, in almost every case the standard of acting is so far superior to US-produced fare as to be pointless to even compare the two. Taken for what it is though, an epic story of America&#8217;s becoming a nation, THE KENT CHRONICLES is entertaining &#8212; albeit light &#8212; television mini-series fare.",The Kent Chronicles

The acting was pretty good in my opinion with his Russian friend being the funniest character in the film. A good love story to watch with your girl friend. I also kind of like films that don't have a ton of things blowing up or fight scenes some times. I like the facts that you have a bunch of friends on a long road trip bonding as they reach their goal. The film also has directors commentary and deleted scenes for people who like those tpe of things.The consI really wish they had went into some more details about the PIC people in charge and what they did exactley and why. I would have liked them to explore the causes of and issues of suicide a bit more. I also would have liked to know more of how things work in this after life as compared to the real world.

Moreover, these two dandies just have to SEE if they can commit the perfect murder.  In some ways the film is not just a meditation on good and evil, and at heart, the ethics of killing another human being, but also considers the recreation activities of those who have &quot;everything&quot;.  When one has every material advantage, the biggest house, the most exprensive car, a lover, drugs (presumably) what now for fun?

917359,"I probably should have realized that the WARRIAH~! parted on poor terms with the WWF in 1996, but I hadn't realized just how poor they were.This documentary is rather entertaining, with lots of footage of the ULTIMATE WARRIAH~! but for the most part... it's not a ""documentary""; it's commentary.While people like Edge, Jericho, and Christian seem to respect the WARRIAH~!, everyone else just absolutely s***s on the man every moment they can after the opening pleasantries about how big an impact he made on the business!Every other scene features Hulk Hogan or Ted DiBiase or Bobby Heenan or Sergeant Slaughter or Steve Lombardi or Bruce Prichard or Gene Oakerlund s***ing on the WARRIAH~!  Every chance they can, they keep saying how awful a wrestler WARRIAH~! was, which in the case of some people (Hulk Hogan much?) is the equivalent of the Pot approaching the Kettle and saying ""You are black"".Obviously WARRIAH~! was nowhere near a decent wrestler at the time, but the fact that his peers constantly remark just how awful he is is insulting and a blatant ""hitjob"" to tarnish his skills.  The fact is, while his skills weren't likely very good, they were about on par with much of the WWF's in-ring quality of the time.  Is the WARRIAH~! a bad wrestler?  Yes.  Is he substantially worse than Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Rick Rude, Sergeant Slaughter?  Absolutely not.  The WWF's in-ring style in the mid-late 80s and early 90s was what is called by some ""hoss"" style, meaning a heavy emphasis on ""big"" guys (muscly or tall) and little to no emphasis on actual athletic talent.  This was in the era where Vince's Big and Tall fetish was running rampant.Even after showing the part regarding WARRIAH~!'s Wrestlemania victory over Hogan, they CONTINUE to s*** all over WARRIAH~!'s skill, and go on to start PRAISING HOGAN as if he were the superstar for so graciously ""passing the torch"" to Hogan, while Jericho, Edge, and Christian have the decency to say that WARRIAH~! could put on great matches with great opponents.Before this DVD, I had figured the ULTIMATE WARRIAH~! had had some sort of colossal mental breakdown or devolving into serious drug use or something to warrant such a title as ""The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"".  Instead, it starts ALL OF A SUDDEN in early 1991, after continuous WARRIAH~! bashing and a quick overview of his feuds with Rick Rude and Randy Savage.ALL OF A SUDDEN at the Royal Rumble, it's said that WARRIAH~! basically held up Vince for more money, saying he wouldn't go out and perform unless he got paid a certain amount.  I agree that this is a really piss-poor unprofessional thing to do, but the talking-head commentary takes this event and runs with it for the next ten minutes, bashing and bashing how awful and evil a man WARRIAH~! is and how arrogant he is and how bad a wrestler he is (take a shot) and how ungrateful he is.Then comes his lawsuit in 1993, changing his name to Warrior, and returning to the WWF in 1996, only to be fired again for no-showing and demanding more money.  Again, this is a bad thing, but hardly anything like ""self destruction"".Perhaps his brief time in WCW could explain the whole ""self destruction"" part, and it does... for five minutes.  And only covering one promo.  ONE!  WARRIAH~!'s first coming to WCW, where he had a 15 minute rambling promo on Hulk Hogan that, due to WCW's own incompetence and lack of leadershipm was completely unscripted, nonsensical, redundant, and absolutely mad and out of control.And that's it.  Then they go on to show his match against Hogan from Halloween Havoc 98, arguably one of the worst in history.Then it ends with some brief mention of his speaking tours, which unfortunately they can't show any footage of (I would've given this DVD five stars if they just had the footage or at least mention of that damn chestnut of WARRIAH~! wisdom ""Queering doesn't make the world work""*), and that's it.So what we have is a fun collection of videos of WARRIAH~!, accompanied by a total hitjob of bashing and heavily biased commentary, boiling down to Christian, Edge, and Jericho respecting WARRIAH~! for his contributions to the business, and the rest hating WARRIAH~! and hoping he burns in hell (exaggeration, but close enough).Also, bonus matches~!

1402122,"For the first half hour or so Johnny English Reborn is a surprisingly funny spy spoof that's a huge improvement on the dire first big screen outing for Rowan Atkinson's hopeless yet supremely self-confident spy who was originally dreamt up for a series of credit card adverts and seemed ill-suited for anything longer than 30 seconds. Where that misfired more than it hit, the sequel begins rather well as the now disgraced spy is called out of his retreat in a Tibetan monastery (where he's learning, among other things, the martial art of dragging boulders with his testicles) by a reluctant MI7 to uncover an assassination plot aimed at the Chinese premier.Some of the jokes are out of date - his sparring with Gillian Anderson's unimpressed spymaster, all impeccable but monotonous pronunciation, is like a flat rewrite of Judi Dench's scenes in GoldenEye that's 16 years too late - but there's plenty that does raise a smile or the odd laugh, not least a particularly well-executed parkour chase scene across the rooftops and along the dockside of Hong Kong where the joke is that, despite obvious audience expectations, English's ineptitude constantly fails to materialise as he never puts a foot wrong and repeatedly outthinks a killer with a minimum of effort. But once the action leaves Hong Kong it obviously forgets to pack the jokes for the return trip and becomes a tired but watchable run-through of stale routines that weren't that funny when they were being done back in the 60s when people first started making mediocre Bond spoofs - the clumsy would-be knowing banter with a villain over a game of golf, the gadget filled chase scene (here in a motorised wheelchair), the assassination attempts by a ridiculous villain (here an elderly Chinese cleaning lady) survived through dumb luck rather than skill... you've seen it all before, and better done, and compared to the likes ofOSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spiesit seems stuck in the last century in the wrong way.There are some compensations, with the biggest surprise how much better Rosamund Pike is here than in her genuine Bond film, Die Another Day, giving a much more natural and appealing performance in a role that's not much more than reaction shots and exposition before turning into the romantic interest just because that's part of the formula. It's a shame that she doesn't get more to do, but that could apply to most of the cast in a comedy that seems to have been made by a director who doesn't really want to do a comedy in a classic case of trying to turn the film he's been hired to make into the different kind of film he'd rather be making instead.That problem is increasingly apparent from the deleted scenes on the Blu-ray and director Oliver Parker's rationale for cutting most of the funnier moments purely to keep the story moving while bizarrely leaving the now redundant and occasionally laborious moments setting them up in the final cut: in this kind of film the story is really nothing more than a near irrelevant coat rack to hang the jokes on, and it's the jokes that should take priority. As he rationalises his decisions as ""small sacrifices worth making"" to get to the next mundane plot point you can't help thinking he's the kind of director who'd cut the farting cowboys out of Blazing Saddles because it wasn't really moving the story forward. Not that there's much originality on display in them, but some - an extended walk-through the newly privatised MI7, English so preoccupied with trying out the gadgets in his car that he doesn't notice machine-gun firing killers are chasing him or a throwaway gag with some exploding chewing gum - are much better than what did make the final cut even if they did need a bit of tightening. The same could be said of the deleted scenes presentation as well since the disc doesn't offer the option to skip Parker's near-identical explanations for cutting the jokes out of a comedy.Aside from a decent 25-minute making of and a not particularly funny gag reel the rest of the extras are the usual puff pieces on how Atkinson is the comic Messiah, though his perfectionism is absent from what makes it to the screen in the last two thirds of the movie. Like so many movies shot digitally rather than on film the 2.35:1 widescreen picture quality tends to vary from sharpness (usually in studio scenes and the Hong Kong section) to a rather soft, pallid, undetailed and lifeless look (most of the exteriors) but is acceptable.",N/A

989684,"We love Christmas movies but I'm not sure what everyone is loving about this. We were disappointed... Andy Griffith + Christmas should = GREAT, but this turned out to be a low budget made for TV snooze fest. We love Andy Griffith and were hoping to add to our annual Christmas viewing list of must watches but we won't be watching this one again. Andy was the main reason we bought this plus the fact that Netflix does not carry it plus it had so many raving reviews and high ratings here on Amazon. Turns out this is boring lame story w/ lousy acting. While it did have a couple of okay moments, this movie could have been so much better. It is hard to pin point. Maybe it was the uninteresting story or the bad script or the reality that Naoimi Judd is not a very good actress or all the little things like the fact that trees in Kentucky don't have leaves in December nor do you drive a convertible in December in Kentucky, just to name a few. My wife kept looking at me while we watched this saying ""this is really cheesy"" and ""why did you buy this""???Andy Griffith fans may want to pass on this one and know that he isn't even the main character. The main actors are Naomi ""Dudd"" and some little angry troubled brat(whose singing voice is not so good). Do buy this if you are a Naomi fan. For everyone else, my advice, save your and money wait for this to come to Netflix(and the drink a lot of coffee; otherwise, you may fall asleep...). My 3 stars rating is being kind. My wife would say 2 or 1.If you want your Andy Griffith Christmas fix, watch the wonderful ""The Christmas Story"" from the 1st season of The Andy Griffith Show - episode 11.

I prefer ol' McClane to slicker more ninja-like modern heroes, and you probably will too.  He's still reliable as an action lead.  Timothy Olyphant is a good villain and Justin Long is pretty funny and not as irritating as I feared.Because it falls short, I WOULD have given it two stars.  But in today's world of terrible Indiana Jones 4 and Star Wars prequels, I give this a generally positive ""three star"" rating for the sheer fact that it didn't go back in time and ruin the old Die Hard movies like some kind of time-warping Terminator.",N/A

531387,"Even though `The Contender' can be considered a take-off of the infamous Clinton scandal, there's many things that make it likeable; even for people who don`t appreciate politics.  Although you probably won't recognize most of the actors, the cast in its entirety is excellent.  With Jeff Bridges, Joan Allen and Christian Slater, the movie does offer some familiar faces.  But in my opinion, the show is simply stolen by Gary Oldman.  This is the first role I've ever seen him in; and it has since spawned my looking into his others.  Oldman is portrayed as the bad guy here (which makes him hard to like), but he does an excellent job.  There's also a good appearance by Sam Elliott, who co-starred with Bridges in `The Big Lebowski'.  He's a little rough around the edges, but his appearance still compliments the film.  And once you get past the extraordinary cast, there is actually a good movie.Joan Allen, the lone female present, has pretty much the starring role.  Women in politics is a touchy subject with many people; and this movie can certainly offend either way.  Allen (as Senator Laine Hanson) is selected to be the vice president of Bridges' character (known as the infamous ""Mr. President"").  The fact that she'd be the first woman ever in office turns a lot of heads and explodes into mass hysteria.  The film is a very good look at the corrupt side of politics; as Oldman (playing Rep. Shelly Runyon) and co. dig up whatever they can, truthful or not, about Senator Hanson.  That's where the title comes in.  The Senator is in fact a contender, as she fights off everything they throw at her.  The quote that Jeff Bridges uses (`they caught you being a human') sums it up perfectly; as things that seem morally wrong for politicians are acceptable for regular citizens.  The movie never really deals with the real aspects of political affairs.  It's only personal; which is what makes it watch-able for anyone not privy to political affairs.  A hidden treasure within the film is its subtle comedy.  Jeff Bridges provides most of the laughs; as he has an ongoing joke to see if his cooks will ever be out of some rare, unheard-of ingredient.  I particularly loved the part with the shark-steak sandwich.  I won't spoil the rest for you.  Also, the part when he cites his bowling average as 150 is great; though much more hilarious if you saw `The Big Lebowski'.  The greatest, and funniest quote of the movie comes from Joan Allen.  When compared to Clinton, she says `...[he's] not guilty, but responsible'.  That'll obviously bring out a laugh for everyone.The film does have a weird, slow start; but it picks up as it goes on.  `The Contender' is said to be a thriller, though nothing is really that thrilling.  It may be hard to enjoy for people who are expecting action or in-depth drama.  There is a continuing battle between the sides (good and bad), and nothing really unique takes shape.  Until the end.  I don't like to spoil movie endings or say too much about a movie; and I won't do that here.  I only gave this film 3 stars because it is very hard to ""get into"" what's happening.  But the acting is more than superb; mainly by Joan Allen.  I wouldn't say she is perfect, but she's not far from it.  The fact that she keeps things very personal makes her hard to figure out; which was intended, I`m sure.  Nevertheless, it's an excellent performance.  The slow start certainly knocks it down one star, and the ""Mr. President"" clich&eacute; is something we've seen far too many times.  The ending makes up for a lot though, and without it I would've gave the film only two stars.  But I do highly recommend `The Contender' to anyone.  As I've said, you don't have to be partial to politics in order to enjoy the film.  But then again... it certainly doesn't hurt.",N/A
522517,"The opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for the movie.  We are introduced to a buffed-up, shaggy-haired Tom Cruise climbing the vertical face of a rocky cliff in the middle of some barren landscape.  It is a beautiful, breath taking, death-defying ballet, but it is an entirely solo act.  The premise of the television series was that a group of skilled government operatives would be brought in based on their specialties and orchestrate a complex mission.  The first MI movie actually showed some of this spirit in the opening embassy sequence, but lost its steam as the complexity of the plot wore that movie out.MI:2 is basically all Tom Cruise all the time.  He drives, he fights, he dons disguise after disguise, he jumps, he kicks, he hides, and does all those things that action stars do.  Sure, there are a couple of support agents, but one is a glorified chauffeur, and the other just looks at a computer screen and looks worried.  The plot is standard action movie fare.  Bad guy, a former MI operative himself, wants to get his hands on a ultra-deadly toxin and its vaccine.  He plans to use it to demand billions from Australia, and the only one who can stop him is Mr. Cruise.  The key lies with a former lover of the villain.  A jewel thief, played by the beautiful Thandie Newton, she is recruited by Mr. Cruise, and they both promptly fall in love.  Much mayhem and destruction follow, as well as the predictable twists and turns, which climax in a mano-a-mano between hero and villain.The movie bears the hallmarks of the direction, noted Hong Kong action filmmaker John Woo.  There are the beautifully choreographed gun fights, the use of slow motion to enhance the drama and the mood of the characters, as well as the requisite doves flying in slow motion.  The special effects are par for the course, with plenty of explosions, bullets and locations that seemed to have been built for the sole purpose of being destroyed during gun fights.  One special effect that is particularly effective (until it is used for the upteenth time) is the removal of masks.  It is truly fantastic what a leap in technology we have from MI:1's mask removal sequence and MI:2's mask scenes.All in all, it is an average action movie that strays too far from the more cerebral Mission Impossible roots to land squarely in James Bond territory - there is even an M like character portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins.",N/A

446863,"What most of you probably don't know is that this movie is ""very loosely"" based on a book by Stephen McCauley. In other words the book and the movie are very very different. I watched the movie first and liked it because I thought it was fairly original in that it was very different from any other romantic comedy I had ever seen before. It was only by complete accident that I later found out that this movie was inspired by a book. After reading the book, I went back and re-watched the movie, and thought to myself, this movie is an absolute insult to McCauley's book.The thing that I am most upset at the movie for is having Nina fall in love with George, because THIS NEVER HAPPENS IN THE BOOK. In the book Nina and George only love each other as friends and Nina never tries to seduce George like she does in the movie.There are many other huge differences between the book and the movie.  Like the fact that Paul, George's new love interest, is not an aspiring actor who lives with a critic named Rodney.  In the book, Paul lives in a small town in Vermont and is the writer of the town's newspaper. He also has a son named Gabriel, whom he adopted from a country in either South or Central America. It is not until George meets Paul and Gabriel that he agrees to help Nina raise her baby. What is really funny is that so much time has passed between the time that Nina originally asked George to help her raise the baby and the time that he accepts her proposal that by the time he tells her he wants to help her she has begun to think that her idea was not a very good one in the first place. She grudgingly accepts his offer to help her with the baby and basically tells him that she really doesn't expect this to be a permanent situation.In the movie Constance is Nina's stepsister, and in the book Constance is a somewhat mutual friend of Nina and Joley's. Nina and George do meet at Constance's party, and Joley does tell Nina that George needs a new place to live before he ever tells George that they are breaking up. However, in the movie George and Joley have been together for 4 years, and in the book they have been together for less than a year.In the movie George's brother, Frank, lives in New York and they have a pretty good relationship with each other. In fact, George is Frank's best man in his wedding. In the book, Frank lives in Boston and invites George and Nina to the wedding hoping that he can pass off Nina as George's girlfriend so that his fiancee and her conservative family will not find out that his brother is gay. When George and Nina arrive in Boston and Frank finds out that she is pregnant and cannot hide that fact he becomes very upset and demands that George and Nina make up a story that they were secretly married because of the baby. This offends George and he ends up not even attending his brother's wedding.In the movie, Vince is the father of Nina's child and is extremely resentful of her relationship with George. In the book, Howard is the name of Nina's boyfriend and she does not even meet him until after George has moved into her apartment. Howard and George become good friends and after Nina breaks up with Howard, George often remarks about how much he misses having Howard come to visit them. George also spends a good bit of the time trying to get Nina and Howard back on speaking terms with each other because he does not like it that Nina wants to exclude Howard from the raising of his child.I really don't understand why the movie producers bother to base a movie on a book when they have absolutely no intention of staying true to the book in any significant way.",Object of My Affection VHS

Red is voiced by a different actress.I wondered how well this movie did in the theaters compared to the first, and the Internet Movie Database showed that the first movie opened to 16 Million USD while this movie opened with only $4 Million USD the first week in the theater. Hoodwinked Too had terrible earnings compared to the first which is a reflection of how movie goers felt about the film.This movie didn't have the charm or surprises of the first. There were new elements, but no new magic (which is hard to achieve in a sequel, but it can be done...the Toy Story sequels for example).The references to Star Wars sure seemed out of the Blue. Other Gags in the movie seemed contrived and didn't gain the laughs I'm sure they were hoping for.The goat was pretty funny in the first movie, but in Hoodwinked Too, it's hard to understand why he's in it at all.The one thing they could have used more of was the evil bunny.For parents, this one may be harder to watch.

Johnny Depp shows up at the end of the film, but his appearance is more of a cameo than a performance.The movie itself isn't bad. The story has a good moral (tolerance) and the setting of a small 1950s French village is beautiful. However, the film isn't all that great; it's just average. The film's story is just another rehashed version of a water-downed Hollywood favorite: an outsider with liberal values moves to a small secluded place, the outsider is threatened, but in the end the outsider ""enlightens"" the people about their backward ways.Tolerance and forgiveness are essential in life. Jesus was all about forgiveness and Christians should be the most forgiving people. There are some Christians who aren't very tolerant or forgiving, but many are.

1421021,"WRESTLEMANIA XXVIIApril 3, 2011Georgia DomeAtlanta, GeorgiaBefore I get into my review of the matches, I want to tell everyone why I think this WrestleMania was a disappointment from where I sit. Its booking was Russo like. I expected WWE is pull out all the stops since this wasnt the strongest Mania card in a while. But they somehow didnt move forward in the booking. I will explain in more detail in my match reviews.World Heavyweight Championship:Edge (Champion) V. Alberto Del RioWhy is this the opening match for the THIRD STRAIGHT PPV??!! They didnt have any other match they felt could have given the crown life except this match?? Why not put Orton/Punk here & have this match where Orton/Punk was? The World Heavyweight Championship Match should NEVER open a WrestleMania. Plus the Royal Rumble winner was in it, so at least put him a little higher on the card!! It makes it look like you have doubts for him to draw in the future. As far as the match goes...Better than what I thought it was going to be. It did get the crowd into so it did its job there. A couple of botches but thats ok. Edge retains. ***1/2Cody Rhodes V. Rey MysterioI was expecting A LOT more from these two. The match was slow & didnt pick up the pace like a Mysterio match normally does. Rhodes didnt perform like I thought he would have. He was in there with Mysterio!! He can like a pig look good in the ring! Rhodes gets the win. **Big Show, Kane, Kofi Kingston, & Santino MarellaV.Wade Barrett, Ezekiel Jackson, Justin Gabriel, & Health SlaterHave you even seen an 8-Man Tag match without ANY tags? This was the first. The match was changed the day before the event to have a better match by taking Vladimir Kozlov out and putting Kofi in. So lets give them...2 MINUTES!! Yes, this match was 2 minutes long. Big Shows team wins. That doesnt even make seem right. Why would the faces win?? The pretty much beat the crap out of the core for the final 2 weeks of build-up & 3 out of the 4 core members have championships!! Way to protect your champions!! This match was a DUD!!!CM Punk V. Randy OrtonOne of the few bright spots on the card. How good of a heel is CM Punk??...Just amazing is the answer!! Great ring psychology with the work on Orton's knee. Orton selling the knee injury to perfection. A predictable set up spot for the RKO at the end but its all good. Orton wins. ***1/2Jerry Lawler V. Michael ColeIf you were thinking that this match was going to be good going into the event...you are dumber than Paris Hilton. For months Cole has been pretty nasty to Lawler & even cost him the WWE Championship. So simple logical calls for Lawler to get revenge & win the match. Cant really screw up the booking on this one right?? So lets see how they managed to screw it up. The match went too long for what it was. You give this match 10-15 minutes and an 8-Man Tag 2 minutes!! Cole was in control for WAY too long. Lawler finally gets the upper hand & wins the match. He celebrates with Stone Cold for like 5 minutes (really...do you need to give them more time??) Then the Raw GM says that Cole wins by DQ because Austin did something. Umm...what?? (no pun intended) So Lawler doesnt get the win in his most likely only WrestleMania match. How is this closure on a SIX MONTH long feud? You have feuds that long to match go to Mania for the good guy to prevail in the end. Horrible...oh...DUDNo Holds Barred Match:The Undertaker V. Triple HThis was the match that everyone was talking about going into Wrestlemania. So everyone was thinking this match was going to be the best on the card. It was the best match on the card. But it also was the most disappointing match on the card. This match was hyped too much for me. I was thinking that this match had to be something special. They start brawling on the outside for like 5 minutes, then they start hitting their finishers?? This match had way too much OVERSELLING. After every move..im serious...EVERY MOVE...they would sell for like 2 or 3 minutes. Triple H dominated most of the match. He hits 3 Pedigrees & taker kicks out. Hits him with tons of chair shots & taker kicks out. Hits him with Takers own Tombstone & taker kicks out. Then somehow taker locks in Hells Gate. Triple H tries to fight out of it. He even had takers shoulders to the mat for like 3 minutes & the ref didnt even go for the pin once. Triple H passes out, wakes up just in time to tap & passes out again. Then Taker oversells for like an extra 10 minutes! Taker, the man who won the match is selling stuff that happened to him like 10 minutes earier while Triple H wokes up for his coma again about 2 minutes after the match. They could have booked this match A LOT BETTER. I understand that Taker was selling so that the fan can see that Triple H was the better man but didnt win. The problem is that nothing really happened in this match that Taker didnt already go though in any other match. So overselling doesnt work here. ***3/4 match but not what I was looking for.John Morrison, Trish Stratus, & SnookieV.Dolph Ziggler & LayCoolWasnt expecting a long or good match here & that is what I got. Snookie does a pretty impressive handspring elbow & Morrison hits Starship Pain on Ziggler who was on the floor & thats about its. Morrison, Stratus, & Snookie win. *1/2WWE Championship:The Miz (Champion) V. John CenaI wasnt expecting too much from this match. It was better than I thought but not enough for me to says ""oh my god"". It was decent. The only real problem I have with it is the ending. Miz & Cena get double counted out. The match is a draw. The Rock comes down & restarts the match with no dq & no countout because he is the host and he can do that. Rock hits Cena with Rock Bottom, the Miz covers, & retains. **1/2 Then the Rock beats up the Miz. My problem is that why did they have the book the double countout? Why not just have the Rock come down & hit Cena with the Rock Bottom? Plus, the Miz just retains the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Cant he celebrate it? Why book it so the Rock beats him up? Again, its a protect your champion thing.Overall the booking is in serious question. Plus the Rock opens the show and cuts a promo for 15 minutes & you dump The United States Championship off the card so the Rock can talk?? He pretty much said the same thing he has been saying for the last month. I was very disappointed in this years WrestleMania. Hopefully they learn from their mistakes this year & WrestleMania XXVII in Miami will be a lot better!!",WWE: WrestleMania XXVII
881934,"This 2005 creature feature aired on the Sci Fi Channel. Yeah. I could stop reviewing right there because that's all you really need to know about this formulaic monster flick. Why go on? Nature run amok movie...Sci Fi Channel...clich&eacute;d. Nearly every film that ever aired on the Sci Fi Channel stinks in some significant way. Bad acting from second and third tier actors and actresses, lazy direction, cheap set pieces, bad CGI special effects, lame plots--it's always the same story with these guys. I'm not sure whom they've got in their stable of writers over there, but they need new blood fast. I suspect the same script just floats around in perpetuity with only the names of the characters and the type of beast changing on a regular basis. The plot always goes something like this: outsider or scientist type moves into small community, discovers a sinister corporate/military/evil white guy conspiracy that sacrifices nature in the quest for profits, and joins a small group of those in the know in order to destroy the threatening monstrosities in question. The end. Add a few twists to the plot, sprinkle in a ton of clich&eacute;s, and you've got yourself the latest Sci Fi Channel movie of the week.""Larva"" meets all of the above requirements, and then some. The story's hero is Dr. Eli Rudkus (Vincent Ventresca), a new veterinarian moving to the little town of Host, Missouri in order to fill the vacancy left by his predecessor. The town desperately needs Emil's services since the main means of income in the little berg revolves around the cattle industry. In fact, a corporate concern (here we go) called Host Tender Meats pretty much controls the village. They buy up all the product in town and call the shots about what the cattle eat. That's why the company is especially stoked about a new feed they've developed. According to the company's PR flacks, the new food will guarantee adding serious weight to the cattle in town. More weight equals...wait for it...more beef and more profits. Everyone wins. WRONG! Host Tender Meats has a serious problem with their new product, a problem we witness in the opening scenes of the film when a weird creature bursts out of a dead cow in full view of several teenage witnesses. No one knows at the time what just happened, but they will soon. Host, Missouri is about to become a disaster area.Rudkus learns about this strange phenomenon when a local rancher by the name of Jacob Lang (William Forsythe) calls him in to perform tests on this odd creature. The veterinarian discovers a couple of disturbing things. He learns that the larva likes human blood and grows larger after a feeding, and he suspects the new feed from Host Tender Meats is causing this aberration of nature. When he tries to tell the townspeople, they greet his claims with jeers. So do the higher ups at Host Tender Meats. The evil owner of the firm, Fletcher Odermatt (David Selby), and his attack dog lawyer Hayley Anderson (Rachel Hunter) laugh loudly and publicly at Rudkus's concerns. Eli's charges soon bear fruit when the larvae begin attacking human targets. Fortunately for the film, this involves an ""Alien"" like embryonic period followed by a cheesy CGI beastie bursting out of the victim's chest. Eli, Jacob Lang, and the newly educated Hayley Anderson join forces to save the town. Their mission is not easy. You see, the larvae soon develop the ability to fly through the air. Yes sir, flying larvae. No one is safe, and the very fate of the world rests in the hands of these unlikely heroes. Roll credits.I detected several subtleties in the script that surprised me considering the low budget, clich&eacute;d mess that is ""Larva"". Check out Eli's last name. Rudkus is the surname of the main character in Upton Sinclair's seminal socialist, anti-meatpacking industry screed ""The Jungle"". In fact, a lot of the plot mirrors stuff that took place in Sinclair's novel. The monopoly Host Tender Meats uses to control the ranchers, for example, as well as having the town sheriff on the company payroll is lifted right out of the book. Pretty obvious where the screenwriters' sympathies lie, eh? The literary underpinnings of the movie fail to help in other areas, however. The cheap 'n cheesy CGI effects are laughable, as is the idea of Rachel Hunter playing a corporate lawyer. Also working against the film (or for it depending on your demeanor) is a number of unintentionally hilarious scenes. I couldn't stop laughing over the sequence involving two youngsters messing around with each other only to have their little skin party interrupted by the messy arrival of a larva bustin' out of the boyfriend's body. The following chase scene involving the girlfriend and the beastie keeps the guffaws coming. Heck, even the goofy picture on the DVD cover made me giggle.First Look Pictures (a warning sign about the quality of the picture right there) brings ""Larva"" to DVD with no extras. Oh well. The film is still more than watchable. Sure, it's stupid on a metaphysical level with truly humongous plot holes, but the humorous aspects in a number of scenes coupled with decent acting (thank the lord for small favors) and several extremely gory kills make this movie a must see for creature feature fans. As I indicated above, it's not original in any way, shape, or form. Clich&eacute;s abound. But every once in awhile we need to sit down with a movie, throttle our brains down into neutral, and just veg out in front of something truly mindless. ""Larva"" fits that bill quite nicely. I think I'll give the film three stars. That's probably one more than it deserves, but I'm feeling generous tonight. Have fun and don't consume any meat lest you become the next victim of LARVA! Bwaahahahahahaha!",N/A

1680257,"The Best Offer is a film at once unique in its ingredients but familiar in its recipe.  I don't know... like a ""hamburger"" made with the rarest and best meats.  (That's a terrible analogy, but there it is.)  The film is both a satisfying bit of entertainment and a spotty attempt to reach a bit deeper.  I enjoyed it while it lasted, but I don't have much extended praise to share.As an art collector, artist, art historian, and somewhat of a shut-in myself the film speaks to me on several superficial levels. I utterly adore the subject matter, I still find it deeply interesting, but that isn't quite enough. The parts seem to be greater than the sum.The world of buying, selling, and forging antiques has always been ripe for cinematic and literary imagination.  It's a great juxtaposition: beauty and malice. This film fits into that lineage as a relatively cerebral and mysterious fiction; that is not to say it's particularly intelligent or especially imaginative, despite its efforts to be both. Being cerebral -- that is, existing largely around the emotions and behaviors of the central characters, as opposed to blunt action -- can be just as dumb as an explosion or a car chase at every turn... minus the thrill and with the added peril of pretentiousness.Done well, cerebral narratives are the best sort. They move us, but what's more, they offer explanations as to why we are moved in the first place. Unfortunately this film comes up short. At its core it's a basic heist drama and it winds up latching itself too faithfully to that metric. It's dressed in a promising and dizzying array of stops, starts, and meandering explorations of human nature but those are all just dressing for the same story repeated a million times. It's never particularly pretentious, although some aspects of the film grate the sensibilities: e.g. the bizarrely intelligent little person in the bar who serves as overbearing metaphor and narrative parallel; or the wealthy onlookers ogling at Virgil Oldman's gloves which he wears to protect himself from germs (gloves aren't odd, people wear them... why pretend otherwise?); or the fact that Robert appears to have a really great location for his tinkering shop but never seems to do anything... etc. But rather than embrace the stilted qualities of the main character, become mired in the melodrama of its risky plot devices, or succumb to the oft-vapid setting of the art and antiques world, the film is self-deprecating and critical enough of such things to be both party and convincing critic at the same time.  At moments the film is about much more than art or selling it/obtaining it; it digs to the core of the human qualities that make great art so lasting and so financially valuable.  But then it doesn't endeavor to illuminate its own findings.  The film stops short, or it holds back, or it doesn't understand what to do with its big, human ideas.  Perhaps this is why the disappointment is greater, for despite all of the careful construction the carry-through is so inevitable and anticlimactic that one begins to question what it was all for.The acting and technical filmic aspects of the movie are strong. Geoffrey Rush is a superb actor and he brings life to every role I've found him in -- this one proving no exception. His character is unsavory, but vulnerable; he's unsympathetic, but we manage still to dig up empathy for his circumstances.It's a movie about idiosyncrasies while managing itself to be disappointingly conventional. It's clear that the creators were aiming for more and they very well might have succeeded if they'd sacrificed a bit of style and convention. Like so many before it, The Best Offer is lost somewhere between style and substance... but the style is fun to indulge for the duration. It's a fine bit of entertainment, but sadly not much more.",The Best Offer

341717,I just love Susan Hayward - the best looking of all the great actors. She was the first red head I fell in love with.Allready in the opening of the film one could feel the 60's. Even Harold Robbins' story is a part of that. I enjoyed it!,N/A
258856,"Though I'm not particularly religious myself, I've always been fascinated with the subject - whether one is among the faithful, ambivalent, or a hard-core atheist, one should I think acknowledge how important religion has been to all the world's cultures throughout history.  If you care about the present, I think you need to know a bit about the past - more than a bit - and that certainly includes knowing something about Christianity - and perhaps even knowing something about our culture's popular religious stories and entertainments, as well as the more serious studies.  So though I don't spend as much time on the subject as I'd like to, I make an effort to watch at least one religious epic every year that's new to me (and usually one or more that I'd already seen).  The late 40s through the early 60s saw a whole lot of them in America, and as they're mostly pretty long and often cover the same ground, it's a many-years-project.  This year:  THE ROBE.I guess overall I was a bit disappointed with this one; I didn't expect brilliance exactly but I suppose I thought it was going to be a bit more entertaining or edifying than it actually was. Being the first Cinemascope feature I supect probably accounts in some part for the conservatism (and I'm not talking politics here) of the filmmaking - it's just not an excitingly-shot film in any way, and it doesn't help that it's nearly all done on sets, and not particularly real-looking or beautiful sets either. Sure, it's a cut above the cheapie historical stuff from the period (i.e things like SLAVES OF BABYLON, a William Castle film from the same year) but it's nowhere near the sumptuousness of many of the major historical epics from later on in the decade.  Director Henry Koster's idea of shooting for the widescreen seems mostly to consist of having lots of people or things filling up the 2.35 frame, rather than moving the camera or having multiple actions happening in the shot. Tedious, generally.If the sets and camerawork are dull, at least the color photography of Leon Shamroy is fine - not perhaps as brilliant as the best, but pretty enough though this transfer doesn't seem perfect - and the cast didn't let me down, even if Jean Simmons is rather wasted in the torn-between-the emperor-and-lover role. Richard Burton is pretty darn good, and Victor Mature is his usual much-better-than-he's-given-credit-for self; my favorite scene in the film is probably the one early on where Jesus rides by (unseen except for profile, hand and leg shots - reminiscent of the way he's treated in BEN-HUR which, like this film, is based on a then-popular novel about the ""side stories"" around the messiah) and Mature's slave character Demetrius is instantly taken with him and decides to follow him. Being someone who doesn't believe in this stuff I can't say I find this, or Burton's later conversion, ""convincing"" but it is fairly effectively done and carries more emotional charge than the bulk of the film. I also quite liked Michael Rennie as Simon Peter, and Jay Robinson is memorable I suppose as Caligula though it's a fairly typical and not so subtly gay/mincing stereotype. And Ernest Thesiger is GREAT in his one little scene as Tiberius.So all in all this is, I would say, worth seeing if somewhat flat.  The Palestine-set scenes are generally more effective than the Roman ones, and I think the film might have been more effective overall if there'd been less concentration on Rome overall.  Thankfully it's shorter than a lot of the other ""epics"" of the period, at 3 hours this would be tough to get throUgh I think.  My personal favorite of this genre from the period is probably the 1959 BEN-HUR; later TV miniseries like JESUS OF NAZARETH and MASADA are also I think more impressive both as spectacle and in a spiritual sense, though nothing will top Martin Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST for me as a film that made me really think about this period, this man, and what he (or He) means in human history.DVD NOTES:  I have the older, original DVD release from a decade ago which looks OK though a bit soft; but as Wade H. Rice Jr. in his excellent review here notes, even the newer Blu-Ray has some color issues; it seems a full restoration of this film is probably needed.  In any case, the DVD is certainly watchable enough, and as I said, even the best color reproduction is probably not going to keep one from noticing the so-so production design and sets.",N/A

432709,"I remember seeing Halloween in a packed theatre when it was re-released in '79 and being on the edge of my seat.  Until the first Alien and Night of the Living Dead, a film has never scared me as much.  Well I can still say that Alien & Night are first-rate horror films.  I can no longer say the same about Halloween.  I'm not sure why this film now feels so hollow & rudimentary in places.  And the acting in this film is often terrible.  Except for Donald Pleasance, I think it's safe to say these girls needed a few lessons.  It's not completely their fault(the script is pretty bad and the screenplay draws the characters as if they were utter morons).  Carpenter has never seemed to direct actors well, especially his female actors, and it definitely shows in this film.  Halloween is virtually without gore but that was not a consideration for me when reviewing this film.  I  prefer suggestions of horror over gore, anyday.  In conclusion, if you're a first-time viewer and your expectations aren't too high, you may enjoy this.  It still retains a decent atmosphere of dread along with a few scares, I suppose.  But the film is no longer the fright classic so many of its defenders make it out to be.  I would recommend the two films I mentioned earlier over this: Alien & Night of the Living Dead.  Anyway, I gave the dvd 3 stars: 2 for the film and an extra star for the features & commentary.",N/A

Also, as is the case often in these type movies, are a series of improbable events that move the story along, such as the live news being shown on the plane, that made me say &#34;seriously&#34; and smack my forehead and events that never got quite explained in a way that made sense anyways.The movie does keep the suspense and action going for it, as it does do a good job at that even though there are numerous plot holes and improbable events that lead to the culmination of the bad guy(s) with their plan to escape, which I wont give away here but was another one of those &#34;seriously&#34; smacking the forehead moments. Along with very predictable ending that followed the formulaic conclusion and hero saves the day theme.As a pure action movie, this is ok enough popcorn fare but with its formulaic plot, improbable events that move the story along and predictable ending makes this movie less than what it could be.

Told mostly from Stauffenberg's and his crew's point of view, Valkyrie is clever and often engaging, but the moments of the film that are supposed to be suspenseful just end up coming up pretty empty.  The fact that Cruise is simply miscast as Stauffenberg doesn't help matters either, but what the film does manage to have going for it lies in its attention to detail, and the fact that it features a cast full of familiar faces from across the pond including Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, Eddie Izzard, Thomas Kretschmann, Kenneth Cranham, and an all too briefly seen Kenneth Branagh.

The ideas around sexual orientation and confusion are often dealt with as comedy or simply in passing.Denied does explore these issues, and has an interesting story.  The acting is solid in most cases.  It was clearly filmed on the cheap, and it seems a decision was made to try to cover the cheap with 'art'.  Somehow, someone decided that throwing in bizarre cuts, strange noises, etc, would distract us from that problem.  Problem is, it distracts us from the story.  It can be a strain to follow, and really takes away from the story.

101328,"Quentin Tarantino wrote the ultimate guy flick in the form of a romance movie, and then let Tony Scott polish it off with a bit of Hollywood sparkle. The resulting kitschy film comes off not so much a blockbuster epic, nor does it resemble a Tarantino-like piece of art. It just represents a sort of middle of the road movie that really could have been so much more, but still satisfies..Clarence is a loser, until he meets Alabama, a young prostitute hired to show him a good time for his birthday. The two fall in love, and what starts with Clarence killing her pimp to take back her stuff, results in a cross country chase with Clarence and Alabama toting half a million dollars of cocaine in a suitcase, with the mob and the police on their tail.The biggest draw of the movie is the star power, and more so the chemistry between certain actors and actresses in the many key scenes of the movie. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken play their cameos to the hilt, while Gary Oldman's performance as an urbanized white pimp absolutely steals the show in the first half of the movie. Up until Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette reach California, the movie remains dark, gritty, violent, and irreverent. But once the sunshine state hits, the slapstick-like comedy takes over, resulting in a shootout ending that doesn't so much make sense as it does distort the overall tone of the movie.You get the sense that no one really knows what the hell is going on, so each character acts their own way. This results in a strangely mesmerizing but disjointed movie experience, as the movie definitely shines and lulls in its given moments.But still, this movie is way smarter and more enjoyable than many other summer blockbusters that get tossed out there and deserved more acclaim in its 1993 debut than it originally received.",N/A

But there was nothing else.  This show rocked.  I loved the first season, and liked the second.  The changes they made in the second season brought the show more towards a fantasy show, and less like a strict star trek type scifi series.  Yes, i understand there are many who think this show never had a good rooting in genuine science, and that's fine.  You can say that about almost any scifi show.  It's a matter of degree.  but in the days it originally showed, I loved it.  It was fantastic.  Recent viewings of this show makes it apparent that it really  wasn't that great.  The stories are hard to swallow and the special effects weren't special at all....almost as bad as Dr. WHO.  While the original star trek holds up, this doesn't.  I think the main problem is the subsequent release of STAR WARS.  That so surpassed this in quality that this show became dated very quickly.  So while i may have loved this at 12, i was easily led to another galaxy at 14 and this became somewhat of a joke.  Watching now is really hard.  Finally, the producer's series prior to this one, UFO, is a different story.  The special effects are only part of the show, not the main part, and they hold up.  The stories are really really good, and while the show is somewhat dated, it finds a groove early on and is a quality glimpse at late 60's briton and british views on scifi and the future.

Too, casting Malcolm McDowell (light colored hair/blue-eyes, 5' 8"" tall, and weighing 140lbs dripping wet) as the bluff rogue Flashman (black hair and black moustache/dark brown-eyes, 6' tall, and weighing in at 13 stone = 180lbs) was totally wrong.

1322192,"""Hereafter"" was directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Matt Damon, C&eacute;cile De France, and Frankie and George McLaren. George Lonegan (Damon) is a psychic who views himself cursed with this ""gift"" of visions and the ability to talk to those in the afterlife. Marie LeLay was a respected television journalist until a brush with death in the form of a giant tidal wave inspires her to write a novel called ""Hereafter"". Frankie and George McLaren play the twins Marcus and Jason. Marcus is on a search for answers after his brother dies suddenly and he didn't get to say goodbye. Eventually all three cross paths in the most random of ways that will make you raise an eyebrow.This film tried to bill itself several different ways as if it was similar to ""The Sixth Sense"" (it isn't) or perhaps is a big budget thriller since it has that giant wave and another accident scene later (two scenes does not an action movie make). This is a quiet, slow-paced drama watching these people attempt to continue their lives though one feels cursed and his relationships always fall apart, one is being abandoned by those close to her that feel she is losing it, and the brother that feels like half of a whole. The whole film is just ok for me. I felt it easier to relate to the woman and the twin than the psychic's dilemma. Jay Mohr is a great casting choice for George Lonegan's brother who wants him to start making money off his talent again (with the brother as manager, of course). While Cecile and Marcus are both on a determined path looking for answers, I felt like George was wandering aimlessly just hoping to dissolve into the background, giving up on happiness all because as soon as someone finds out he is psychic, they demand a reading and don't like what they hear. The tidal wave was VERY impressive shaking my entire living room with the sound, but seeing it this week for the first time seemed far too much like the current events in Japan (which I hear this film title was pulled from the Japan market by request).Even if the afterlife, heaven/hell/whatever is a fascinating subject for you, the film really doesn't go very deeply into it. All the characters have very mild experiences and most of their journey takes place trying to get others in the tangible world to understand them. *Shrug* Oh and the ending made me roll my eyes so that didn't help either.Bonus Features:The movie can be played with focus points or you can watch them separately. You can learn all the different aspects that went into filming the tsunami tidal wave. Exploring the possibility of life after death just asks actors, filmmakers, and producers what their opinions are on the subject. Clint Eastwood talks about the casting of the film, who auditioned and who was given their roles on the spot, and the casting of locations, and as always the actors talk about Eastwood as a director. They interview some mediums who talk about ""head-tapping"" to profile violent criminals and make predictions. They also explore the bonds between twins from experience and also the filmmaker's knowledge of the ""white light"" experience many have when near death.""The Eastwood Factor"" is a feature-length profile of the Actor/Director's career, in his own words, covering his over 35 years with Warner Bros. Obviously this documentary was originally made for ""Invictus"" because of the introduction and Morgan Freeman narrating. There are clips from tons of his movies exploring his favorite characters and aspects of his career. It's a great introduction to Eastwood for newcomers and a good refresher course for avid fans complete with a tour of his own costume library.",N/A

314684,"If for no other reason, this is an amazing film because it was shot in Technicolor - in 1930! It's primitive color, but very interesting at times and intriguing to view. Although the story and humor are very dated, Eddie Cantor is very funny at times playing the super hypochondriac.There are lots of gags, and like the Marx Brothers films, so many that you can't catch them all. Also like the MB, some of the humor is topical, so audiences of today aren't going to get what people would laugh at in 1930.Through all the jokes - many stupid and many clever - Cantor is a likable guy and also a good singer. The songs in here are decent, too, some of them very catchy. They also have the added attraction of having the Busby Berkeley dancers/girls joining in.Make no mistake: this is a ""sappy"" film, so dated it's extremely stupid in spots....but definitely something for the film collector.  I am sorry this talented man doesn't have his films out on DVD. Someone has dropped the ball there, big-time.  Cantor deserves better.",Whoopee VHS
1322273,"I love Clint Eastwood's movies, I've seen all in the last 25+ years. The older Eastwood gets, the more thoughtful.Hereafter is a movie, and psychics and the afterlife, which Clint at 80+ might be thinking about.The action, the main action in the movie starts with a Tsunami in south east Asia. A lead character, Marie Lelay, played by Cecile de France, hard-edged news reporter gets caught in the rising waters, drowns, and has a near-death experience. She experiences the afterlife before coming back to this one. This experience changes her life from a skeptic. The other hero, George Lonegan, played by Matt Damon, is a reluctant psychic. There is also a young boy searching for answers about death. I won't reveal more of the plot.This is a gentle and thoughtful movie, well acted and well directed, but it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Like why the Damon is so reluctant to help people? Why he feels compelled to tell people all the negative things he ""sees""? I have met psychics who do this on a daily basis, who are much better, much more psychic, who tell their clients more than the Damon character. They are not bothered by having this gift at all.The main action here is the tsunami, in the first ten minutes. The rest is love story with a lot of synchronicities. These synchronicities tend to happen to and around psychics and not to most skeptics. The world (or our experience of it) expands or contracts depending upon our expectation of it (!) I had expected Eastwood would do more with his themes, but he didn't. he chose to stick close the the generally agreed reality. I would have liked to see more hereafter in Hereafter.Actually there is an amazing convergence of opinion from people who have experienced near-death and psychics about what to expect in the afterlife (though not from organized religions).  If you have no not heard of these things you will find this movie fascinating. Very mainstream, really. From all acccounts I've heard, this is a short glimpse of what to expect, ""you won't be alone""...",N/A

Alas, ""Music and Lyrics"" falls into the mundane category.  It starts off alright hitting bulls-eyes about eighties pop culture.  Hugh Grant is at his sarky self-depricating best here.  I thought quite possibly there's going to be a ""This Is Spinal Tap"" style parody.  Unfortunately, there's the most predictable love story afoot here.  Grant is a real pro at carrying this most average of material.  He should be doing more films like ""About a Boy"" instead of this formula product.  Drew Barrymore, appealing as she is, doesn't seem to have the acting heft to carry it off.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the target audience for this movie.

615259,"I've recently got around to seeing this latest addition to the zombie film genre- and I must say I was thrilled by many of the aspects of the film, especially the direction, acting etc. But one thing that really irked me is there were many blatant references to the Living Dead trilogy, and I don't know whether to take those into account with the rating of this review. At least five or six plot points coincided with ""Dawn of the Dead"" especially, and Romero in my mind may want to sue for royalties. Unfortunately, as is with the case of many films, cds, etc, the younger generation will not recognize these references, and be possibly left out at discovering the genius of the likes of George Romero. The ending is another point of scorn with me, I found it unsatisfying and anticlimatic, and would have preferred something a bit less predictable from Hollywood standards. Overall this would receive 2 and a half stars from me.",28 Days Later
41383,"Best:1) It's a great example of a B-movie that became a genre classic. That alone makes it worth a look.2) It shows how black & white filming can add elements of creepiness that's hard to duplicate in color.3) It still makes you think about the possibility of ""pod people"" alien takeovers in real life (especially when one of your friends starts acting strangely).Worst:1) Although it's great 1950's fare, it's still low-budget and the acting was generally period melodrama. Older folks will appreciate it more than young people.2) Aside from a short interview with Kevin McCarthy (for a talk show sometime in the 1990's) there are no special features at all. That's a real shame for this one, being that it deserves more discussion.Recommendation:Lovers of great oldies rate this one highly for it's nostalgia value. Others, however, may find it a bit corny by today's standards. Regardless, it's a must-have for any serious sci-fi/horror movie collector.",N/A
469761,"I wanted to see this to see what all the fuss was about as it caused a major stir at the time. It is one of the first hand held camera film mockumentary flicks that resulted in a tirade of mockumentaries, the recovered footage genre, including District 9, Apollo 18, and [REC]. The hand held camera work is at first interesting and then nauseating and you wish they could keep it still. The ordinary production is all part of the set up to the famous ending that still makes me shudder. It is the creepy atmosphere and odd feel of the film that makes it scary, rather than what is said or the actual events.The fear in the eyes of the players is quite disturbing as they look genuinely terrified. This translates to the audience also and one never knows what to expect next. The dialogue is virtually improvised and even the actors do not know what is going on adding to the morbid fear. As such this is a curio that is worth seeing once and then perhaps forgetting.The realism of the content, as though someone left a camera running and now we are seeing it unfold, was an innovative idea but has since been flogged to death. The sequel 'Book of Shadows' is one of the worst films ever made as it completely removes the doco feel with hand held cam and suffers terribly as a result.",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS
502614,"The premise of this movie is intriguing : A group of soldiers ambushed while on a humanitarian mission in Iraq, struggle to adjust to life back home in the United States. But somewhere along the way everything just falls flat between the writing and/or the acting, it seems to devolve into an anti-war movie. Which would not be bad or wrong, because I could understand were soldiers would begin to question the necessity or reasoning of a war, were they were injured, but the reactions seemed forced like these actors are articulating the views of writers rather than that of actual characters, but i'm not quite sure where to put the fault writing or acting.",N/A
1391592,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.The Help is a pretty good movie with some funny moments, and a good look at the other side of households in the 1960's. The new Gwen Stacy leads a solid cast in one of the best films of the year. (However, The Artist earned Best Picture fair and square; I think that Viola Davis should have tied with Meryl Streep for Best Actress, though I have not yet seen The Iron Lady, and that Berenice Bejo & Jessica Chastain should have tied with Octavia Spencer for Best Supporting Actress; it has happened before, you know...two actors winning the same award). Throughout the film, I couldn't help but think with regret over how I impulsively ended a friendship I had with a black girl last year who had never been anything but nice to me. And that I sincerely regret.There was one aspect of a scene that I did not like, and it's probably not the scene you're thinking of. Though I will not say what that aspect is, I just had to say that.I give the movie three stars because it profanes God's name by combining His Name wth a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity. Why do film-makers feel the need to disrespect our Creator by profaning His Holy Name? The third Commandment saith, Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.-The Second Book Of Moses Called Exodus 20:7 and The Fifth Book Of Moses Called Deuteronomy 5:11.I recommend this movie for only one viewing.",N/A
1656062,"I liked the themes presented in this movie. They are morally valid, deeply felt and deeply convincing. It's just, I'm an adult. Not a twelve year old. And I guess that's the audience eliott and rossio are going for, aside from toggling to adult audiences on occasion in the narrative. The feel of the movie was theme ride along with &#34;western movie trope recycling,&#34; everything from &#34;The great train robbery&#34; to &#34;Once upon a time in the west&#34; to &#34; a few dollars more&#34; to the silent movies where the heroine is tied to the railroad tracks by the Evil Villein and it is the hero's job to rescue her. this, of course is all new for those who've never seen. Lastly, the point by the other reviewer of partial native american descent is taken- the story of genocide is always disturbing, always a rent in the fabric of the continuing tale of humanity. To have it represented in the form of cartoon villeins is, well, good for a twelve year old. To have it depicted as the overwhelming truth about the west, well, I wasn't there, so I can't say. It does smack of a simplistic interpretation. Maybe it's true. What I think the movie misses are the larger points of the tides of humanity at that point in history, justifying the cartoonification of the events depicted.

1026817,"Good acting from both Aaron Eckhart & Helena Bonham Carter in this movie! Interesting split film cinematography throughout the entire film which gives  an interesting take on each character and gives the film an artsy feel.....This movie is slow to unfold and a bit boring overall! Both characters in this film begin talking during a wedding reception.... At first you think they don't know each other and are getting to know each other for the very first time...... It becomes apparent later on in this film that they were romantically involved years before hand, but have gone on to live separate lives..... The wedding is the first they have seen each other in years.Helena Bonham Carter's character, we find out, currently lives in London and is married to a cardiologist, while Aaron Eckhart's character is dating a much younger woman who is a dancer. I found it annoying that they keep referring to each other and their former lives together in the third person.Anyway, the two end up having a one night stand once the wedding reception is over and then Helena Bonham Carter's character returns home to London. It is apparent that Aaron Eckhart's character is still in love with Helena Bonham Carter's character and he wants her back. Sounds like Helena Bonham Carter's character was the one to end the relationship with Eckhart's character years ago, moved on in her life & she simply isn't in love with him anymore.",Conversation(s) With Other Women

994591,"Dario Argento, master of the Italian ""Gialli"" and one of the most celebrated horror directors of all-time, needs little introduction to the well-versed horror fan.  Early in his career, he delivered classic film after classic film, too numerous to mention but some of them include ""Deep Red"", ""Suspiria"", ""Phenomena"", ""Tenebre"" and the list goes on.  Unfortunately, the last 15 years have not been so kind, as he has been mired in a bit of a slump.  Every film since the decent ""Trauma"" (1993) has been somewhat lackluster, with the low point of his career being 1998's atrocious ""Phantom of the Opera"".  But I digress.  His works throughout the 70's and 80's are gold and we will always treasure his cinematic output of that era.  While ""Jennifer"" can hardly be considered a return to form, as some reviewers have dubbed it, it is a decent piece nonetheless.Writer/actor Steven Weber stars as weary cop Frank Spivey, whose life and sanity are destroyed by a fateful encounter with a young girl.  Frank interrupts what appears to be a murder-in-progress: a crazed maniac wielding a meat cleaver over a bound, helplessly cowering female figure.  Frank has just rescued ""Jennifer"", a mute girl with a killer body but who has a horrifyingly deformed face.  Confused by simultaneous feelings of repulsion and sympathy that course through him, Frank takes the girl into his house once he discovers that she's homeless.  He has fallen under Jennifer's morbid spell, as the girl systematically destroys his will, his sanity, his family, and his life.While ""Jennifer"" cannot be considered terrible, I would still have to rank it as one of the lesser episodes of the strong first season of ""Masters of Horror"".  It has the thinnest and most predictable plot of the episodes I've seen, as the ending can be spotted a mile away.  However, this is somewhat compensated by the generous amounts of graphic sex, violence and pure perversion.  The sex sequences are amazingly filmed, since they combine feelings of both excitement and disgust.  It has some exploitation elements euro-horror fans will adore.Jennifer herself is a study of contrasts; she has a stunning body but her face is hideously deformed.  She genuinely appears to be a pathetic, withdrawn creature who just wants to be loved yet her ravenous appetite for flesh makes her evil incarnate.  As a viewer, we're not quite sure if we're meant to sympathize with her or to loathe her.Maybe this episode was not all that it could have been since it was not written by Argento, but by Weber.  Or maybe Argento's time as one of the premier horror directors has long passed and his output from now on will likely never surpass the ""decent"" threshold.  Bottom line is ""Jennifer"" just didn't click with me, it's not horrible but at the same time it's not very good either.  Although some of Argento's trademarks from his earlier movies are here, the excellent camera work, the creepy children's music, and bugs flying around, this piece further goes to show that Argento is losing his touch as the story drags on and doesn't offer much to the viewer save for token scenes of cannibalism, sex and gore.  Argento is on board for an episode of season two so let's hope he can reverse this downward trend he's been on, although I doubt that will happen.",Masters of Horror - Dario Argento - Jenifer
654196,"I generally liked the beginning of this film that had a premise that all humans have their own ""demons"".  Demons grow as the soul of their owners grows.  They are also the opposite sex of their human counterparts (i.e. girl would have a male demon and vice versa) and take animal form.  In the beggining young adults have spirit that is free and uncompromising; but the local ""ministry"" wants them to obey and conform unconditionally.  So this is a universal battle of good and evil in its psychological form.  There is also a metaphysical component of the movie where narrator mentions parallel universe and people form the parallel world that are connected by the universal ""dust"". I liked the fact that the main character of the film is a girl - that premise gives some hope to humanity of this little made up universe.  Also the visual effects are great.  Most ""demons"" are such fantastic animals full of personality and charm.  cast is definitely superior, but by the middle of the film - story starts to fade and becomes boring.  It is probably a moment where reading the book would be more interesting than watching this story unfold.  I cannot tell you how this film ends because, unfortunately I fell asleep at the end of it. Younger audiences amy find it more difficult to follow since most actors (young and old) have very strong (australian) accents.",The Golden Compass
1176153,"I just finished watching both Winds of War and then War and Remembrance back to back. I have a completely different opinion of both projects with the first mini series getting better reviews than the last one.Overall, the writing was odd. The words were like something out of a 1930 movie. The way the males in the series talked to the females. Very mechanical and so respectful and proper. The affairs of the main characters, Pug and his wife, were so sterile. Even when his wife confronted Pug's mistress (if you call her that) it was just too polite.Also, I think the first mini series was shot just as Robert Mitchum was reaching his apex as a leading man. Then a few years later, he was older and much stiffer. All of the shots of him had him walking in standing and walking out. That isn't to take away from his presence, which he had plenty of, but to underscore that his character was supposed to be a Navy Captain in his prime. Clearly he was too old for the part and it showed.I also didn't like all the character recasting that the second mini series did. When you watch these back to back, the characters don't make sense when you are dealing with a new face. I think originally, when the two series were separated over many years, the viewing audience was not a familiar with the old cast and more forgiving. Back to back viewings probably not so much.I also really got sick of the thick British sayings. ""Indeed, By-Jove, Cherri o, etc. I did a little research and most of those sayings are rare, but not extinct in England. I think it is representative of the writer's impression of the English and not so much the reality of their slang.The best performance in both series was Ralph Bellamy as FDR. He made FDR come to life and played the part with conviction. The others got too old and they just waited too long to shoot the sequel.It is worth the viewing. I love WWII history and this provided some historical perspectives but there was far too many literally manipulations to take most of it serious. It was entertaining but could bog down if you tried to watch it back to back to back.

858635,"""Going up River"" is a short 88 minute documentary on Massachusetts Senator and former presidential candidate John Kerry. Although it is obviously pro-Kerry in the election year of 2004, I found that many of the men he served with testified to the strength of his character and leadership underfire, giving it substantial credibility.  It is the answer to the 2004 Swift Boat Veterans for Truth smear campaign against Kerry that focused on a small number of men who also served in the ""brown water navy"" in the Mekong Delta and on the coast. The crew which Kerry commanded on his small patrol craft would go on the record and coroborate the commendations that Kerry recieved, which the SBVT claimed were ""exaggerated.""This controversy stems all the way back to the Nixon era, as this film reveals portions of Nixon's secret recordings where he recognizes Kerry as a strong speaker and a definate ""Kennedy"" type, making him a formidable opponent. Kerry's appearings before a congressional commitee as spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) features prominently in this doc, and brought Kerry to national status overnight, prompting Nixon to arrange John O'Neill, another Naval officer loyal to the war effort to debate Kerry on the Dick Cavett show.  O'Neill would later be one of Kerry's largest detractors in the 2004 campaign, which evidences the truism that politicians have long memories. Many members the the George W. Bush administration got their start under Nixon, with VP Cheney and Defense Sec. Rumsfeld among them. They clearly had not forgotten Kerry's leadership of ""long haired communist sympathizers"", who were believed to be traitors to the US.This film is mainly concerned with Kerry's decision to speak out against a war that almost every veteran felt was unwinnable and mismanaged. Though most of the film concerns Kerry's activism in the VVAW, it is a good picture of the man's early life, as it begins with a brief telling of Kerry's childhood and college years, attending St. Paul's in New Hampshire, then Yale.  Kerry was obviously very much affected by the Kennedys and his entrance into Massachusetts politics in the 1980's was directly under the guidance of Ted Kennedy (though this film only covers the first 30 years of his life). The relevance of this movie shows the divisions in American society that started with the assassination of President Kennedy, the hasty entrance into a war 13,000 miles away little more than a year later and civil rights issues. The men that Kerry represented were full of anger when they returned home at the propaganda that surrounded Vietnam and the disparity between the fiction presented to the US public and the reality of the war over seas. This led to some excesses within the anti-war movement, among them the SDS radicals and the Weathermen who advocated for armed resistance and overthrow of the government. To many people, the VVAW and the SDS type groups were one in the same, but as many veterans pointed out, they are not. In his own words, Kerry states that the protests he led in April of 1971 were designed to stop the unecessary violence, not create more of it. Needless to say, any scholar of the Vietnam era knows that hard feelings were born on both sides, ones that carried over into the next generation. Kerry's 2004 campaign was seriously damaged by the Swift Boat Veterans, who through massive publicity spin, turned  a man who could've easily obtained a deferment into a traitor, because he believed in speaking the truth rather than hiding the reality from the public.  Though Kerry nearly rose to the highest office in the country, his life and work are reminders of the vicious internal conflicts in Cold war America that still cause reprecussions today.",Going Upriver - The Long War of John Kerry
892060,"One should always go into a Miike Takeshi flick expecting something weird.  That is just taken for granted.  Anyone who wants a ""safe"" film should just put the Miike box down and walk away.  Of course, weird does not always guarantee good.Okada Izo was an actual historical figure, a samurai from the late Edo period and one of the most feared assassins of his time.  He met a messy end, being tortured and crucified, thus ensuring his transformation into a legend.  Gosha Hideo chronicled Izo's life and death in the 1969 film ""Hitokiri.""  Miike Takashi took the challenge of filming Izo's afterlife, setting his film ""Izo"" as a direct sequel to the earlier Gosha movie.The story begins with Izo's death and the resurrection of his angry spirit, which is propelled backwards and forwards in time and space on a perpetual killing spree.  Izo himself does not really understand the motivations of his actions, being guided by some other force, and while he is able to feel pain he can never die again.  He only slaughters, becoming more and more demon-like in appearance (and super-hero-like, complete with mask and cape) and his killing continues.  His ultimate target is thought to be the group that controls humanity, the military, media, scholars and religious figures who conspire to keep people ignorant and controllable.  Towards the end though, Izo has completely forgotten what he is trying to accomplish, and just cuts down anyone in front of him.In order to create some buzz and interest in a somewhat esoteric project, the producers of ""Izo"" went with a ""dream team"" casting of pairing popular auteur Kitano ""Beat"" Takeshi (Fireworks) with the rogue director Miike Takashi (Audition).  This duo alone had massive drawing power, although they decided to hedge their bets by sticking in other stars like Momoi Kaori (Love and Honor), Matsuda Ryuhei (Cutie Honey - The Movie (Live Action)) and even popular K-1 fighter Bob Sapp.With this in mind, ""Izo"" is packed with great bits.  Surprisingly, Kitano Takeshi gets very little screen time.  From the advertising, I would have thought he was a main character, but his is only a minor role.  The Bob Sapp battle was very cool, and there are several outstanding sequences. One really great piece of ""Izo"" was the interstitial sequences of the ""screaming philosopher"" and acid-folk guitaristTomokawa Kazuki.  His particular voice and style of music added a perfect grounding point to the chaos of the film.Ultimately, however, ""Izo"" just didn't really work for me.  I could see what Miike was trying to accomplish (Izo as a metaphor for humanities capacity for violence.  The thought-controlling group that dictates what people think.  How ""righteous vengeance"" can deteriorate into cruel killing for killing's sake...) but it was all just too muddled together.  There were many, many great scenes, but on the whole the film was dragging and repetitive.  Izo's grand killing spree eventually just becomes...boring.  And maybe that was a point Miike was trying to make too.",N/A

By that I mean it could have all been done in the same 1/4 of a mile radius with some stock road sign footage added. Not a lot of scenery that's going to ""pop"" on the Blu Ray.It's like you got some really top of the line cameras, your best female friend was a great actor, everyone else was just glad to be there, you wrote a decent script but didn't have enough money to travel so you stayed in one spot in one Tennessee town and made a movie.Country Strong couldn't carry Coal Miner's Daughter's spitcup but it would look good with it in a DVD two-pack at Wal-Mart.",N/A
1325929,"Of all the subjects of the FINAL 24 series, I guess you could say I'm most familiar with Janis Joplin's sad story.  There isn't too much in this documentary that was totally unfamiliar to me, and if you've read the multiple bios or even if you were simply alive at the time and more or less aware of pop culture, you'll likely find that to be the case as well.  So the filmmakers get a ""A"" for accuracy, but the premise of the ""final 24"" is nonetheless creepily morbid.  The re-enactments are as good as you could hope for (with an anonymous actress who actually DOES look like a bit like the rock legend--and moves like her), but it's still seems a bit unseemly to watch, what with the digital  countdown timer and all.  Still if Janis' good buds like John Cooke, John Till, Sam Andrew (almost unrecognizable), Dave Getz and Powell St. John can contribute to the project in good conscience, I guess I can allow myself the indulgence of watching it.  Rounding out the commentary are sections featuring her younger brother Michael, whose comments about his big sister and ""role model"" are touching and a high school friend named Jim Langdon and, not insignificantly, publicist Myra Friedman who authored the first (and some would say most authoritative--and certainly the best TITLED) Joplin biography BURIED ALIVE.For many contemporary viewers, this doc will serve to clear up a number of the myths that have sprung up about Janis'life and death.  To say nothing of the outright lies.  I remember reading a claim by Warhol hanger-on Ultra-Violet that she had been in California when Joplin died and had actually DISCOVERED the singer's body (in Joplin's APARTMENT no less)!  Self-promoting BS like that begs for a corrective.  There is something exploitative about these ""Final 24"" television documentaries themselves, but they do their bit set the record straight.",Janis Joplin - Final 24: Her Final Hours
26555,"I have a problem with Criterion charging an arm and a leg for their DVD's when so many of them are released with little more than bare bones in the way of extra features.  The company's issue of this classic thriller from director Stanley Donen, ""Charade"" is no exception.  Plot wise: Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) returns home to discover that her apartment has been cleaned out, her husband is dead and that she was married to a double agent who had embezzled a ton of money. Into this mix comes the mysterious, savy stranger with too many names played by Cary Grant.  He is determined to put Regina's mind at ease but is he or isn't he working for the same men who killed Regina's husband.  Also in the cast, James Coburn and Walter Matthau in an uncharacteristically serious role.""Charade"" is a classic in every sense of the word, but Criterion has done a rather lack luster job on mastering the DVD.  Although colors are exceptionally vibrant and sharp, there is a considerable amount of edge enhancement and fine shimmering that is detected in horizontal and vertical details. Also, while ""Charade"" is presented in its widescreen aspect ratio, this disc has not been enhanced to take full advantage of hi-resolution, widescreen televisions.  In the way of extras we get a bio on Stanley Donen that you can (of all things) read like an essay by using your advance buttons on your DVD player. (Really, I don't know of a single individual who reads extensively from their television screen)and a theatrical trailer.  That's it.  Criterion's packaging makes it sound like RSDL DVD engineering is a big plus but actually all DVD's are mastered in this format.  Criterion as advertises the film as being offered in a ""pristine new digital transfer"".  The actual transfer falls short of this high praise.  What Criterion really needs to do is get studio approval from the company that produced the film and then do a definitive documentary on the making-of, if they really want their Canadian consumers to shell out [$$$]for their movies.  They also need to do a better job on the actual mastering of the print.  Then, they might be worth the money!",N/A

872238,"When I watched We Need to Talk about Kevin I was interested in stories in a similar vein and a friend recommended ""The Child I Never Was"" to me.  Let that be a lesson to all of us when you find yourself being recommended a movie that is a little strange no some research first I really wish I had at least checked out the amazon views. At least ""We Need To Talk about Kevin"" is a fictional story.  Considering the title of the film I would imagine the object was to explain some of the motivations and make the audience sympathize with Bartsch or at least attempt to understand why he did what he did.  I'm sorry I just don't buy it I understand that serial killers are the exception to the rule in a civilized society but lots of people were unloved as children and others suffer from some manner of sexual kink that they learn to control.Two main things also confuse meSo much time is spent telling Bartsch's side of the story that his victims barely get a footnote on one level this is understandable but when you are listening to the gruesome details of what the killer did to his targets I felt that we owed the victims at least the cliff notes version of their life.I also don't know who is in charge of making the list for Amazon but to see this lumped with the Gay films is actually more shocking to me then the film itself.  This is not a Gay film if you are feeling charitable this is a true crime film now this probably is due to the fact that Gay cinema is small in comparison to most other branches of cinema but in most other examples I can think of no one commits a murder.",Child I Never Was
975182,"Michael Winterbottom's ""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story"" is a film about filming the unfilmable--in this case, Laurence Sterne's famously discursive novel of the same name. The film is delightful as long as it concentrates on the film, less so when--about halfway through--it changes focus to concentrate on the filmmakers. Star Steve Coogan and his pal Rob Brydon set up enormous expectations at the beginning, sitting in their makeup chairs and carrying on a dialogue that's as hilarious as anything in the collected works of Christopher Guest or Larry David. The film then turns to a straight-as-possible film version of the Sterne novel, and is totally engrossing for the next half-hour. But then Jeremy Northam, playing the director, yells ""CUT!"" and the whole thing becomes just another dullish satire of blinkered, self-centered show-biz folk. Coogan and Brydon are still funny playing exaggerated versions of themselves, but the rest of it--including a long gambit about negotiating with Gillian Anderson to get her to appear in the film--is a big, fat yawn. Actors, producers and directors are never as fascinating as they think they are, and though movie critics can't get enough of movie moguls mocking themselves, rank-and-file audiences rightfully disagree. (These are the same shoals on which Robert Altman's ""The Player,"" another absurdly overpraised film, was wrecked.) I'd love to see Coogan and Brydon again, but as for ""Tristram Shandy,"" it's the archetypal curate's egg: Parts of it are excellent, and not the bigger parts, either.",Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story

Von Sydow is a wonderful Ming, Brian Blessed booms and shouts as usual, what-his-name is wooden and hopelessly stupid as Flash, and Ornella Muti is utterly and appallingly appealing to any hopeless male adolescent as Princess Aura.

I was very pleased with that set.  In Volume Two, I noticed that the sound quality in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm was not that great (quiet voices and comparatively loud music).  In this last volume, the sound was questionable in The Littlest Rebel... but it was atrocious in Dimples.  It sounded as if all the actors were talking into pillows.  I have watched these films on VHS and the sound is fine... perhaps something went wrong when they were put onto DVD.I will say, however, that I absolutely love The Littlest Rebel and The Little Colonel.  They're probably my favourite Shirley Temple movies, so to find them both in Volume Three was great.  I was worried about The Little Colonel, though.  The last scene was originally shot in Technicolor; however, in Fox's last VHS release of the movie (colourized), they cut the scene!  I was so glad to see that the lovely ""pink party"" scene was included in this version... it's wonderful to see such an early example of colour in the movies.As with the other two sets, the colourization of the black and white films is good (much better than previous attempts).

Both happen to share a hospital room and both have terminal cancer with just months to live.When Edward Cole (who has billions and wants to spend it) was trying to convince Carter Chamberlain to take the time they had in remission to do things on the bucket list, he compared how fast the last 45 years of his life had went and how fast the coming months would go by.  Edward asked Carter if he rather go home to his family and have them adjust their lives and routines around his disease or celebrate what time was left?If you can take the leap of faith that terminal patients can run off for months without a care and enjoy every minute they have left - you get the message of the film and enjoy the life, love, laughter.",The Bucket List

1692761,"There are plenty of hilarious moments in Ride Along, most of them involving Kevin Hart's antics to try to gain respect from his girlfriend's brother and everyone around him. Parents should know that the PG-13 rating is really stretching it here, as there's lots of innuendo (specifically at the beginning when the main character and his girlfriend talk explicitly about their ""night plans"") and gun violence. Some of it is good-natured, and some of it isn't. Fortunately, the tone of the movie is consistently playful and entertaining throughout, and it avoids boring stretches of time or weird shifts in theme. That definitely makes a type of movie like Ride Along recommendable for anyone wanting to see an hour-and-a-half worth of well-paced comedy.It's not at all original, a criticism that has been the main reason for the film's low rating on popular sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. Most of the twists and surprises don't make the film any different from other buddy cop movies. The plot almost feels like a pit stop between moments where Kevin Hart isn't showcasing his humor. And with the slight exception of Hart, most of the acting is quite generic, like the plot itself. In particular is Ice Cube, who's really just in the movie to play the non-comedic foil.The good news is that the screenwriters didn't dwell too much on trying to sell you on those aspects. Instead it's more focused on trying to make you laugh, something that this movie does well. Because of the great timing and spacing of the many jokes in the film, the shortcomings won't prevent you from enjoying Ride Along. Viewers should go in expecting a genuinely funny movie, because that's all this type of film really needs anyway.",Ride Along
529460,"Well, it's a just a bunch of guys talking about women. They're all players, and they share their exploits--except for the married guy, who's a foil to the others. It's kind of a stuipd premise, and most of the scenes are pretty obvious and not funny.Predictably, they all end-up involved with the same girl (Mia, played by the super-cute Amanda Peet). The execution of that twist is well-done and works to inject interesting irony under the humor. But that's really the only thing going in the whole plot. The conflict development happens a little bit late in the movie, which makes it something of a slow start. (Just a little. I mean, it's not as a bad as &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;.)The to-the-camera narratives are done out-of-context of the movie, which makes them plausible and less awkward than in most other movies that try this silly technique. And since they're less awkward, they come off as a little bit more insightful.The plot resolution is a little ambiguous, and kind of sudden.

Did these guys have enough box office pull in 1977 that would override these turd-like performances?I don't know but it's really a shame because it takes the edge off a film that might have been legitimately great had the two leads been better cast.Still, once you get past the fact that every time the two actors open their mouth you'll be disappointed, the rest of the film is quite worthwhile and it's unique premise, a series of duels over twenty years, pulls you into the story line, especially if, like me, you like historical dramas.",N/A

1300456,"There are many problems with this movie, one of them not being that its a remake.  If this weren't a remake of an even more popular film then it would be just another been there, done that fiasco.  The original film gave Johnny Depp his start.  There doesn't seem to be anyone in this film that is on their way to the kind of career that he's had, but then again let's give it time.  His career took off immediately and this film is already a few years old.  The actors in this are your typical pretty boy and pretty girl where your job is to just look pretty on screen and we don't care if you can act.  Unfortunately, audiences are much smarter than filmmakers believe and want a character to be convincing.  The actor, Kyle Gallner, seems to be the only actor in this that demonstrates a bit of depth with weak material to begin with.  Jackie Earle Haley spends the entire film with his face hidden under a burned mask as the new Freddie Krueger.  He brings ominous tones to the character with stale one liners from this stale script.  People will be soon wishing the old Freddie with his hideous face and comic timing were back that Robert Englund brought to fame almost effortlessly.  The other problem this movie does is it reveals a more horrific past involving Freddie Krueger and the teens he's gutting one by one.  The more the film starts to reveal Freddie's history the less scary the movie starts becoming.  The movie is okay and that's merely because it's another one on the bedpost ad to the series.  It'll make for a great background on a Saturday night, but may not be as entertaining as you hoped.",N/A

716478,"&quot;I've never seen anything like it!&quot; -That must be the most said line in the film!  To be honest I've never seen anything like it either, well maybe a little like it.  Right before Director John &quot;Bud&quot; Carlos teamed with Tobe Hooper for &quot;The Dark&quot; (1979) he blessed the cheezy b horror film genre with this little number from 1977.  The story, penned by the writer who gave us &quot;Village of the Giants&quot; (1965) &amp; &quot;Evil Knievel&quot; (1971) as well as the co-writer of a western starring Kenny Rogers!, concerns a small desert farm town being overrun by extremely hungry and ill-tempered tarantulas.  William Shatner leads the cast as Rack Hansen, the town vet with a cowboy hat.  Woody Strode (Draba from Spartacus) plays local farmer Walter Colby who begins losing his livestock to the horrible poisonous spiders! This one has many alluring elements:  Cheese, people being attacked by tarantulas and totally flipping out, country music, thousands of real tarantulas, webs, Shatner not only talking like a cowboy, but also reacting to vicious man-eating spiders like only he could!  Actually, he's not as over the top as Captain Kirk, but like Kirk, Rack manages to put moves on a female amidst all the terror! Definitely recommended for fans of Shatner and of &quot;the town is being taken over by...&quot; movies.The 2002 Goodtimes DVD is impressive for this film.  I rented this on VHS at a video store that doesn't exist anymore and no one else has it. Imagine my surprise when I saw it on DVD! The film is presented in a Standard screen version only with chapter selection, not to mention great keep case art - Shatner kneeling over a woman covered in spiders!  The DVD is inexpensive as Goodtimes DVDs are and if you like it or even think you will, I can recommend it for purchase.  The image transfer isn't perfect (there's the odd jump that's in the orginal film most likely), but face it, its not getting any better than this.  We're lucky to have it on digital at all!  Check out that last shot when Shatner prys the boards off the window and looks out onto the town! Also recommended: Devil's Rain (1975) - Shatner vs. cloaked devil worshipper Ernest Borgnine!  Also a DVD cheapie.  Film debut of John Travolta as Danny, the eyeless &amp; mute devil worshipper!  Tom Skerrit and Eddie Albert decide to join the fight against evil as well!

653578,"I was originally going to skip this movie due to my utter disdain for Michael Bay and his paper-thin characters and over-the-top bombast. But I caved and went to see Transformers on opening weekend. It's safe to say that this was a project right up Bay's alley. After all, who was expecting riveting character development from a source material about alien robots who kick each other's butts? This project was destined to be a full-on spectacle and little else, which is why Bay is a perfect fit.Young teen Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) buys his first car only to discover that is actually a ""robot in disguise"" named Bumblebee and discovers his family ties to a government secret a hundred years old and an alien war thousands of years older. In the process, he manages to woo hottie Mikaela (Megan Fox, who must also be from another planet just because of how hot she is) and help the good guy Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) retrieve the coveted Allspark and defeat the evil Decepticons, whom are led by Megatron (voiced by Agent Smith himself, Hugo Weaving). Meanwhile, a group of nameless Marines consisting of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson aid in the battle against the Decepticons but add little else to the actual story and your typical, cliched ""goverment agency so secret that the rest of the government doesn't know it exists"" shows up, led by an apparently overacting John Tuturro. John Voight makes yet another appearance as a government suit, and comedian Bernie Mac and comedic actor Anthony Anderson appear to add your typical, cliched comic relief.The story seems basic aside from the occasional Transformers geek-speak and the ""boy and his robot"" vibe between Sam and Bumblebee smacks of Speilberg's touch (Speilberg is the producer), but there are plenty of characters here that are either cliches, add nothing to the story, or both. But the story isn't what makes this movie worth watching. No Michael Bay movie is worth watching for its story. After all, this is the guy who made the Pearl Harbor bombing into a Titanic-ripoff love story instead of using an actual story from the event's victims and survivors. So don't expect anything near Shakespeare here. The only real reason to watch this movie is for the fantastic special effects. So turn off your brain and enjoy.",Transformers

It is not that ogling Miss Ricci by any means ruined my day, but it was not the kind of sophisticated fun that I am always hoping for from Woody.

I have a lot of shorter workouts that do a lot more in less time, so regretfully I had to knock off two stars for that reason only.

It looks like they really jazzed up the Joker's scenes to attract Nicholson, but left Batman as a first draft.Originally, Sean Young was supposed to be cast as Vicki Vale and something went wrong.  I don't think the E! True Hollywood Story has even figured that one out.  But the role fell to Kim Basinger.  She's a great actress, but all wrong for this movie.  The reason: she's blonde.  It throws the entire color scheme of the movie off.  If they had gone with Sean Young's dark hair, then the only color in the movie would've been the Joker's crazy world.The major problem I had with this film was that Tim Burton, as quirky and gifted as he is, can't shoot an action sequence to save his life.

Her charisma alone gets this poorly written, pretentious movie three stars.  I do remember reading a quote from Marilyn, referring to this movie script, in which she said ""He could have written me anything, and he comes up with this. If that's what he thinks of me, well, then, I'm not for him and he's not for me."" Obviously she did not care for the script too much.  It is truly horrible, probably the worst written rubbish ever taken seriously, but only by pseudo-intellectuals who assume anything by Arthur Miller will be up to the standards of ""Death of a Salesman"".  It isn't.  It is so pretentious, corny, contrived, and manipulative it never fails to disgust, degrade(you feel stupid even watching something so inane) and offend.  Still, Marilyn is magical and she can make any movie watchable.  This movie proves it.I would recommend this only for Marilyn fans, and then without reservation.

The other characters serve as an audience to his quick wit and as the link between the civilized world (the writer) and the violent, savage one (the two boys he has a relationship with).

She gets touchy feely on a few occasions, but nothing special. Maybe that's why they had to call her ""Emanuelle"" with one M, instead of Sylvia Kristel's ""Emmanuelle"", because the extra M means MORE sex.That's okay, because there was plenty of sex to be had by everyone else, even the horse! Contrary to the review from ""dirk digler"", Laura did not have anything to do with the horse, and nobody had sex with it. Some lady just massaged its genitalia. Big deal.There is a scene at a party which turns into an explicit pornographic orgy and, later, when Laura is out and about taking pictures of people having sex for some reason, they are all engaged in explicit, real behavior. So that makes up for Laura's lack of ""getting it on"", but her soft-core stuff would've been silly compared to what else was going on, anyway.Now, the ""snuff"" stuff.....I'll admit, it was quite troubling to watch at first, until I heard in a commentary how the director scratched up some 8mm film he shot the scenes with to make it look grainy and real. His efforts paid off, as far as realism goes. I honestly couldn't tell if it was fake or not at first, until one of the ""victims"" (the torn breast girl) didn't quite convince me that she was being tormented. But the meathook? How could you fake that? Even if it is fake, it still is creepy to watch. Definitely effective cinema, if nothing else.",N/A

Eraser never set out to be a &quot;good&quot; film, and it succeeds spectacularly at not achieving this goal. And why shouldn't Hollywood celebrate this kind of filmmaking? After Russell Crowe took best actor for Gladiator it seems apparent that the Oscars need entirely new categories: instead of best actor, how about best OVER-actor? Or &quot;Worst Dialogue Delivered Thoroughly Convincingly?&quot; It takes talent to go so far over the top that you come back again! I'd nominate James Colburn for &quot;Best Lee Marvin Impersonation&quot; and certainly James Caan would sweep the &quot;Most Intensely Smoked Cigarette&quot; category--can that guy suck smoke like nobody else! And Eraser might take &quot;Thinnest Thread of a Plot on Which Action Sequences Can Be Hung&quot;, although competition would be fierce. It would also be nominated for &quot;Coolest Sci-Fi Gun and Nozzle Flashes/Tracer Fire&quot; but wouldn't even get a mention for &quot;Most Buckets of Bullets&quot; or &quot;Most Buckets of Blood&quot;.

801089,"I vaguely remember seeing this film on Continental Video in the mid 80's and considered it OK.  I puchased the original movie poster a couple of years ago and then went on a quest to find a VHS copy of it.  No luck.  Then I heard about Retromedia and Fred Olen Ray Along with &quot;The EEL&quot; decided to do the 20th Anniversary eddition.  I bought it.  Basically Fred Olen Ray had to go through hell trying to piece together a print to Scalps.  Most of the footage shown is grainy from a blow up of a 16mm print to 35.  The cut scenes that were added in are from a Vidoe transfer from the 80's U.S. VHS release and Canadia 3 quarter inch tapes.  Watch the movie once through and please forgive the grain.  The viewing may seem like the film is over 2 hours because it drags and drags on.  The best scene is the throat slashing.  In my opinion it is one of the best throat slashings I have ever seen on film.  I had some time to kill and decided to view Scalps once again with the commentary track on by Lee and Fred.  The commentary is great.  I learned information about the making of a film.  From script writing to finding financing.  The commentary taught me a lesson on filmmaking.  How to make a film with no budget and the tricks to shooting with what you got.  Fred Olen Ray explains about shooting day for night, shoestring budgets, how 21st century cheated him out of $ and the secrets to some special effects that were used for the murder scenes.  I recommend the viewer to watch the film once without commentary then watch it with the commentary.  The movie is not great, the image is grainy and poor but the make-up and gore is pretty good.  The commentary is the best.  Fred's voice over is much louder than Lee's but Fred is much more fun to listen too.  3 stars for gore and commentary.",Sca
852981,"Let it be stated that I have not read the books, I enjoyed The Bourne Identity, and I was looking forward to this sequel.That being said, this film left much to be desired, but its fatal flaw is its utter unremarkability. It just fades from your mind. The only images I'm left with is blurry grey shifting cuts from the extended car chase in a seemingly miraculously resistant taxi and Matt Damons wrinkled forehead and perpetually pouting features.The &quot;shaky camera&quot; style that is taking over hollywood cinema is not just used in this movie, it features in it. It takes the reigns and drives it right over the cliff that is mediocrity. This movie is so hard on your eyes that you find yourself thinking about how hard it is on your eyes and not the movie. Audience withdrawal is not a way to create tension or suspense. Also, the rapid fire cuts and unfocused camera work makes you realize how little you actually see. What is meant to appear as a colossal and destructive car chase boils down to lots of tiny flashes that could be in all reality, bumper cars in an alley.The plot had all the forward motion of a beached whale. yeah, its kinda cool, but why'd the whale decide to leave the fabulous ocean for a gritty beach and what are we gonna do with it now that its here?*SPOILER*They kill off Bourne's only friend/lover right off the bat- supposedly to give him motivation to fight kick and scratch his way to the truth... the painfully obvious, heavy handed, and slow moving truth... So now he's alone again and on his own, plagued by flashback of past murders. Bourne just feels weaker in this movie, narrow escapes seemed lucky rather than skilled, and I he was an inch away from breaking into tears the whole movie.And Julia Stiles just kind've annoyed me...All in all, a rentable flick, but don't pay big bucks at the Theatre for this headache of a film.",N/A

1028067,"Shyamalan's films are somewhat quirky and offbeat and very much draw upon his own idiosyncratic (but neither entirely original or totally out there) sense of what kinds of stories ought to be told. They usually don't conform to the standard Hollywood storytelling model, which means there are gaps and inconsistencies and odd duck characters and miscues that aren't entirely justified or the structure of the films is slanted without a clear &#34;beginning&#34; &#34;middle&#34; and &#34;end&#34; or where a &#34;twist&#34; takes the place of a genuinely motivated character arc -- in general in his case this is not a good thing but every once in a while it gives a fresh and unique edge to his films. &#34;Lady in the Water&#34; was no exception -- and it was clear from the beginning that Shyamalan didn't want to make concessions: he set up a cast of &#34;misfits&#34; and contrived a story that would bring them together under a common cause, and wasn't worried about mixing genres or stretching the limits of plausibility or giving his characters enough evidence for us to believe that they would believe in and embrace this cause at the peril of their lives. This is a story about abandoning oneself to believe in the power of stories, about suspending disbelief and letting the storyteller tell her story however ludicrous its implications become. (What is odd is that he seems to want to say that if we can just abandon ourselves to stories we will be better people and there will be less war, etc. -- but of course it is often the willingness to accept stories about &#34;good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; without fact that gets us so riled up about going to war in the first place). In any case there is something obviously self-serving and a bit naive about the premise of the story -- and the self-reference is as blatant as it can get in this film, since Shyamalan himself acted the part of the writer who was going to write a lot of strange things that would not be accepted at first but eventually would change the world through the power of belief (not to mention the one person who gets &#34;eaten&#34; in this film is a film critic who can't write anything himself but likes to criticize films for lacking neat plots and stories, i.e. one who wouldn't have liked &#34;The Village&#34; or this film). Still, as stories tinged with the fantastic go I enjoyed this one (it's a better film than &#34;Signs,&#34; which did much better at the box office). It worked even better for me on the small screen when I watched it again with a couple of my children on dvd. There I wasn't so bothered by the obviously grandiose delusions of the film (and its filmmaker) -- but just enjoyed, most of all, the undeniably fascinating and powerful performance at the heart of this film by Paul Giamatti, one of the most consistently strong supporting actors in Hollywood, here given center stage. Three stars for the film, and five stars for Giamatti give this film my four star rating.The way I think of M. Night Shyamalan's films is that he is like a small budget independent filmmaker who happens to have big budgets. This is sometimes good and sometimes bad. He tells small stories that appeal to a niche audience -- but luckily for him that niche has coincided with a fairly large number of Americans: mostly sci-fi/fantasy lovers and &#34;believers&#34; who like their fantasy movies to hint at transcendence (the afterlife, etc.) Where this is a drawback is that weaknesses in plot or limitations in scope or unconventional stories that you could forgive (or even celebrate as an alternative) in a small budget independent film are hard to accept in a glossy big budget feature put out by Disney or another major studio. Watching &#34;Signs,&#34; for example, it struck me that I would have liked it much better if it hadn't had such big name actors and hadn't obviously had such a large budget. It feels like a &#34;small film&#34; about a crisis of faith and an identity crisis, but its science fiction premise overwhelmed this rather than working seamlessly with it. (Unlike, say, Spielberg's &#34;Close Encounters&#34; -- a film that was able to manage both intimacy with the characters and a global science fiction premise). Shyamalan obviously has visual talent and the ability to coax exceptional performances from his actors and has been lucky enough to hit upon a few stories that resonated enough at the box office that he has been given free range for quite a few films. Plus, the studios he has worked for have had the good sense to market his films as being different and as expressing his unique vision. I don't know how much longer that is going to work for him, though -- with films like this one and his previous one that have had diminishing returns in the box office he may have to turn to creating the kinds of independent and low budget but high concept films that he would have been making if he hadn't had the good luck to have the right actors and the right kind of buzz that made &#34;Sixth Sense&#34; a smashing success.",N/A
1386814,"I don't recall ever being so annoyed with a lead character in a movie. Apparently she was supposed to be a sympathetic character but she came off as simply a pathetic, whining, self pitying, anorexic jerk. Why on earth would any girl get so bent out of shape by the engagement of a girl who was supposed to be her best friend that she just goes nuts. Or, was she nuts all along and the engagement just pushed her over the edge. It leaves you with the impression that this friendship was the only thing she had and if it was changing then she just had to behave so badly that everyone would notice her instead of the bride. Instead of being happy and supportive of her friend, she made the whole thing about her starting with the way too long scene near the beginning of the movie where she competes with the stepmother in making the toast. And, couldn't they have found a better looking bride.  That girl was just ""plain"". But, the movie was funny and I guess that is what it was meant to be. The scene near the end where she keeps racing her car up and down breaking all kinds of laws trying to make the policeman notice her was too long and annoying also. Contrived is what comes to mind. Halfway through the movie, you simply don't care about this ""heroine"" anymore. You just want her to gain a little weight, get a job, actually care about her friend's happiness and, for the love of Pete, stop whining.  The fat girl was the best thing in the movie. Great performance.",N/A
1226662,"NOTE: There is an update of interest at the end of this review. DOUBT has a potent albeit badly delivered message; it has stellar performances that nonetheless come too close to caricature. It is always unwise to attempt to insert levity where levity is not welcome.Meryl Streep's turn as Sister-Mother-Superior-Wannabe Aloysius (correct spelling is Aloisius by the bye) is simultaneously shocking, powerful and silly. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the beleaguered (and probably guilty) Father Flynn is a character study worthy of Spencer Tracy. He has his dark side and dark moments.What are we, the audience, supposed to doubt? Streep's sanity? Hoffman's sincerity? Didn't the sweet, angelic Sr. James (Amy Adams) steal the show completely? Did Father Flynn abuse young Donald Miller (played beautifully by Joseph Foster II and miscredited at the end as ""Daniel Miller"")? Was he merely protecting young Donald? Did he identify with young Donald's emerging gayness (something Donald's mother clearly discloses to Streep)?Will the question marks ever end??In a way, this film is sheer insanity-in-the-making. A wicked witch of a nun, overburdened as a school's principal, automatically hates and suspects the young priest working at the school. She's out to get him, because she can smell a rat at a hundred paces. Yet as I discovered years later, she was right.There really is something awful, something 'funny', about Father Flynn. His nails really are too long. He resents the Church and its Medievalism. He dislikes the principal for her very crumbly old-fashioned ways. When confronted, he seems innocent and purely motivated. That is, until his facade begins to crack in an ugly way, and we see a guilty, evasive criminal-type. It's a type I know well among the clergy of the Catholic Church.We know the era of pedophile priests had begun to emerge into the public eye at this time, the late 1960s. So, did the priest victimize a ready-made victim, the only black child in the school? Or did he love this child a bit more than he loved the others? Was he merely protecting young Donald? The film, in my renewed opinion, holds the key.Actually, I know a bit more than the average audience. The actors in the film, as well as the direction of the original play, suggest Father Flynn is innocent and Sister Aloysius is a goofy old bat who has gone nuts. She targets Fr. Flynn as the root of all evil, which is actually a root growing wildly in her own head. And by the way, the play - and the actors here - seem to agree that Fr. Flynn is totally innocent.Here's what we all know: nasty looks shot at Fr. Flynn by certain students (BIG clue, thanks a lot). In fact, the little bastard who smiles at the news that Fr. Flynn is leaving gives us nothing - precisely because he's a little bastard.We know the goofy old nun is checking out the priest, investigating his past. We know she's willing to manually explode her rosary into tiny pieces in her crusade to ""get"" Fr. Flynn and chase him from the school. And we know he has a guilty past, which he declares is in the past for good. What we do not know is what precisely happened, what trouble he caused or why he felt the guilt.Like a very bad mystery, this film reveals little. Nothing but Sr. Aloysius' ""doubts"" - and I still ask myself, ""What?? What does she doubt?"", because we are never told what it is she doubts. I thought she simply began to doubt the very existence of God.My wife thought she was doubting her own faith. Also, I had initially thought she was doubting whether she did the right thing in going after Flynn, except that she was confident, glad and showed no remorse. Now I wonder if she was doubting the goodness of the Church, since Flynn is simply reassigned after all her hard work.There is one undercurrent that occurred to me that is not mentioned: the very real damage the Church has inflicted on its clergy. Both Sr. Aloysius and Fr. Flynn can be called victims. God knows what created a beast like Sr. Aloysius. Wounded animals trying to survive, like the Fathers Flynn, are so well known we pretend we don't see them in that light.Flynn comes into this film with unclean hands, and we are shown plenty of hard evidence of that. This in turn made me wonder whose idea it was to rob him of his original innocence, evident in the play. Hoffman's characterization reminded me of the infamous Father Murphy, who molested all those deaf boys in Milwaukee. So maybe the doubt is whether or how long the Chruch will last being run by aiders and abettors.UPDATE, FEBRUARY 2013: The announcement of the upcoming abdication of Pope Benedict XVI, plus a stunning documentary about the Catholic Church's worldwide pedophile scandal, set me to rethinking this film. After all, a crime against humanity is a crime against humanity.This film's facts ultimately must be in the eyes of the beholder. However, I think sadly enough there's concrete condemnation of Flynn here. He gives off all the signs, all the red flags go up and the crazy old nun doesn't seem quite so crazy in light of this. After all, Sister Aloysius makes a few startling discoveries about Father Flynn during her discreetly placed phone calls.Flynn's been shunted to the school - at the end he is shunted elsewhere and that speaks volumes. So I see a more profound message in this film than I ever realized up til now: it is a warning, an early-warning story if you like, about the building storm that was already very old at the time in which this film is set. The crazy old nun was fighting for her church, a church she pictured as disappearing in the near future.She was right.If you want to know all about the real-life problems, I highly recommend the bookThe Case of the Pope: Vatican Accountability for Human Rights Abuseby Judge Geoffrey Robertson QC, human rights attorney and Queen's Counsel.",N/A

Girl figures out she is good at soccer. Wants to do something about it. And thus we get trapped in a redundant cycle of: Jess lies to mother about playing for the team, mother finds out, Jess stops playing, Jess starts playing, Jess lies to her mother, mother finds out.....ad infinitum.See where this is going? It's quite dull and painfully repetitive, leaving us to count down the minutes until the plot reruns itself for the umpteenth time.When the plot's not stuck in its loop, it's busy cramming in limp situations and characters. Jess' family is presented as a near-exaggeration that makes the parents of My Big Fat Greek Wedding look downplayed. Not just the Indian family, even the mother of Jess' british friend, played by Juliet Stevenson, is convinced that push-ups bras and short skirts, not shin pads and cleats, are the only way to attract a man. Both families feature the old standby of Lone Understanding Parent -- trusting, sympathetic dads -- who both exist merely to convince their grumbling spouse to give the kids a break, but only, of course, in time for the Big Finish.On the plus side, the director succeeded in evoking a workable level of charm from the cast and the roles they play, and it's easy to see why so many people have come to like this film.  It's hard not to like these characters.  Plus, both Nagra and Knightley have the good looks, natural charisma, and honest acting talent that makes a person a bona fide movie star. The soundtrack is cool too except for that Punjabi music at the wedding that played on for a tad too long.Yet, on the whole it winds up being a formulaic mess, not very rousing, not very interesting, and at the end of it all, not all that much fun.

The two kids meet up and share an innocent love while the entire island is looking for them.I've enjoyed all the Wes Anderson movies I've watched (only missed one), but I'm not an ardent fan or defender. His casts are always top notch, and this film includes Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, and Edward Norton. Fans of Anderson will find plenty to like in this quirky coming of age story.Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman steal the show as Sam and Suzy, two young kids who are in love. They share adventure, and a first kiss on a beach they call Moonrise Kingdom. I however, wanted to point out that I believe there is a little too much sexuality in the film concerning a 12 year old girl. I don't deny that it is realistic, or that it works in the movie. While on the beach, the two kids go swimming, stripping down to underwear. Suzy's bra shows tons of cleavage, and one shot basically shoots straight down her bra. Also, she asks the little boy to put his hand on her chest. I felt uncomfortable watching scenes on film that are usually depicted by actors at least 18 years of age.I went on Amazon affiliated IMDB to see other viewer's thoughts on this, and anyone who was critical of the sexuality in this movie was called every name in the book. I've never seen so much hate in my life. Fans of Anderson have every right to defend this movie.

973657,"Murder, Inc. (1960) is worth renting as a DVD, for the simple reason thatit shows the ugliness of murder, rubouts, contract killings in a Post-Prohibitionera, during which various gangs cooperated in a national syndicate, for profitmaximization as opposed to rival gangs competing for the same turf.In fact, the gangs now prefer taking the low key approach, staying off the radar screen oflaw enforcement. The biggest profit generators the movies suggests, are shakedowns of themanagement of a company, by micromanaging the labor unions and their ability to strike andhold the company hostage for a large pay increase unless the underworld is used to mitigatethe union's greed, or so they say. Another one, is the protection money requiredfrom shopkeepers, under the risk of retaliation and complete destruction of their livelihood(  of the actual productive assets and inventory) should they refuse and resist payment.This work is completely non-glossy in terms of a film, as it shows the underbelly of crime,and the actual implications of taking part in the underworld, once the gang draws theattention of law enforcement and the top bosses rub out their own helping hands, to avoidbeing connected with the dastardly deeds they ordered be carried out.One of the few artistic merits of their work, is the clarity, sharpness and good editingcoupled with the great wide-screen release, while the story itself (the script) is mixedwith a sentimental love story (perhaps not grounded in reality) to keep viewers interesteddespite  the hard hitting facts. Clearly, this movie was intended  as an ""educational tool""by the police, to discourage crime and enlighten youth from partaking in profit generatingbut illegal behavior.Centered in Brooklyn, NY in the 1930's,  the film is modern except for the telephones, andautomobiles shown, whereas the rest has stood the test of time.The protagnonist, Falk, is an enigma, as sometimes he appears aloof,  like a sitting duckor Momma's Boy,  but at other times, able to transform himself as a hard hitting criminal,keen to violence,  even to ruthlessness and generosity so long as it suits his agenda, evenrape. His oversized coat draws away from the movie's credibility, as it looks it just cameoff the clothes rack, spotless, no dust.It also  gives horse betting and pawnshop keepers a bad name, as shylocking and betting iscondoned.The movie is also brave, in terms of the mini skirts of the dancing girls shown on screen,as the gangsters enjoy the entertainment of night clubs as well as crooners and the girls.The story is valuable in showing how peer and economic pressures can sometimes push anhonest but vulnerable man to get involved in criminal activities, even when simply drivingor cooperating on a contract, vs. pulling the trigger.For those familiar with the hierarchy found in the military, that of the underworldsyndicate is much alike, in the expectation of taking orders from the top without askingquestions, and respecting higher ranked individuals in the movement.The psychology of criminals is also portrayed as that of  greedy individuals, who areunable  to tame their desires and impulses. Falk yells "" Whatever I want, I take! That'swhat hands are for! To take!""Bizarrely, the script is critical and mocking of showgirls as  worthy housewives, as theycan't cook, (boil an egg), dress themselves decently or even maintain an interestingconversation. It also associates those characteristics with  women from European countries,who arrive to the USA, as opposed to home grown USA women.Overall, the story tells how 200 murders in 2 years were committed in Brooklyn alone, by asmall gang for maximizing their underworld revenue generation operations.The story touches slightly on the law, in terms of Habeas Corpus, and corroboratingwitnesseses and subpoenas and the like - needed in preparation of a court date,  and how,at the end of the day, st00l pigeons are a gang's archilles heel.","Murder, Inc.

1538724,"""Death to the Daleks"" was one more Dalek adventure set in a quarry in Jon Pertwee's last season as the Doctor, but the story had a topical basis and included enough creative flourishes to make it interesting if not quite a landmark in the series.On their way to a much-deserved holiday on the planet Florana, the Doctor and Sarah make a forced landing on the forbidding, fogbound planet Exxilon when the TARDIS suffers an inexplicable power failure. There the Doctor meets a scientific expedition from Earth also stranded by a mysterious force that consumes all electric power on the planet. The Earth expedition is mining the planet for ""parrinium,"" the only known cure for a fatal space plague that has struck humans living on Earth's outer colony planets. Meanwhile, Sarah discovers a magnificent white citadel topped with a shining beacon but is captured by the Exxilons and prepared for sacrifice for defiling their holy city. Then a Dalek ship lands on the planet, also seeking parrinium, and the robotic creatures are forced into an alliance with the humans because their weapons don't work without electric power (the Daleks themselves, the Doctor reminds us, are powered by psychokinetic energy).Miners' strikes in the early 1970s were causing intermittent power failures in the United Kingdom about the time Terry Nation wrote the script for ""Death to the Daleks,"" so the British people were no strangers to lights out when the story first aired in early 1974. In fact, series rehearsals at Acton had to be scheduled around the power outages. Exterior shooting took place at a quarry near Lulworth Cove in Dorsetshire--a barren landscape to match Exxilon's lifeless terrain--but costume designer L. Rowland Warne turned this liability into an asset by carefully matching the colors of the Exxilons' cloaks to the various shades of sand and rock found in the quarry. The Exxilons thereby blended into the landscape, making them invisible to outsiders (two actors were, in fact, briefly lost when they fell asleep on location in Exxilon costumes). Unfortunately, the costumes got wet in pond scenes and had to be dried with electric heaters overnight to avoid tearing their delicate fabric.Costume design for the subterranean Exxilons who live in caves under the city was subtly different but equally imaginative, and Arnold Yarrow turns in the story's best performance as Bellal, the Exxilon who guides the Doctor to the city and explains its fateful origins. (Yarrow, a diminutive actor, says he based his performance largely on the behavior of bushbabies and other small, big-eyed primates.) Here the story is padded with scenes of the Doctor and Bellal solving potentially fatal brain teasers as they approach the city's central brain.The Special Features menu includes a workmanlike, 27-minute making-of documentary as well as a 23-minute studio recording showing how cast and crew taped the story set by set rather than in chronological scene order, an innovation imposed by director Michael E. Briant. Also included are interviews featuring the long-suffering men inside the Daleks. Such interviews are becoming a treasured resource as more and more cast and crew from the classic series, which debuted almost a half century ago, are lost to old age.",Doctor Who: Death to the Daleks
583888,"One of the BEST things about Angel Sanctuary the Anime OVA is its content.One of the WORST things about Angel Santuary the Anime OVA is its content.Huh?It is impossible to take a great, super-complcated manga and make it into a good OVA.  Luckily Yuki-Sensei figured this out.  It could not make it into a series form due to its content ""incestual feelings, male with a female soul, rebellion against earth"" 'nuff said.It is odd to say I got into the Manga because of how BAD the OVA was.  I didn't get it at all after the first viewing, but I fell in love with the art work.  If you ever see the ""Angel Cage"" book, BUY IT.  It rivals only Mikimoto-sensei's work in character design and detail (see Macross, do you remember love, some of Evagelion and currently Ecole du ciel).  Anyways, this OVA does not summarize the Manga or provide an alternate adventure.It just does an introduction of the characters of Setsuna, Kurai, Sara, and others.  It doesn't even get into sevorte or any of the major story arcs of the series.If you do not like the OVA I suggest RUNNING to the nearest Borders / B&N; and browsing through the first 3 books.

157476,"After watching ""A Bucket Of Blood"" (1959), I have come to the conclusion that it is an earlier, bloodier variation of the movie ""The Little Shop Of Horrors"" (1960). Both movies were written by Charles B. Griffith.  Both movies were directed by Roger Corman.  In addition, several of the actors appear in both films.  For example, John Shaner appeared as a beatnik named Oscar in ""A Bucket Of Blood,"" and played the dentist Dr. Phoebus Farb in ""The Little Shop Of Horrors.""  In ""A Bucket Of Blood,"" Dick Miller plays Walter Paisley, a nerdish waiter at a Bohemian cafe.  In ""The Little Shop Of Horrors,"" Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelboyne, a nerdish worker at a flower shop.  After accidentally killing his landlady's cat and covering the body in plaster, Walter is acclaimed as a brilliant sculptor.  After cross breeding flowers, and accidentally creating a hybrid plant, Seymour is acclaimed as a brilliant horticulturalist.  Lacking any artistic talent whatsoever, Walter has to kill people and cover them in clay to create new statues.  Because the plant is a carnivore, Seymour accidentally kills people and feeds them to his plant, making the plant grow to gargantuan size.  Walter's boss finds out about what's going on, but doesn't tell the police, because of the money and notoriety it generates for the coffee house.  Seymour's boss finds out about what's going on but doesn't tell the police, because of the money and notoriety it generates for the flower shop.  After everyone realizes what's really going on, the police chase Walter.  The movie ends when Walter hangs himself before the police catch and arrest him.  After everyone realizes what's really going on, the police chase Seymour.  The movie ends when Seymour is devoured by the giant plant before the police catch and arrest him.  Because the violence is deliberate and the ending shocking and depressing, ""A Bucket Of Blood"" is one of the more obscure Roger Corman movies.  Because the violence is accidental and the ending is played for laughs, ""The Little Shop Of Horrors"" is fondly remembered as one of Roger Corman's best movies.",N/A
84161,"I was very into this movie at first simply because i love fairy tales.  But i must tell you it was a far cry from the interesting and creative colorful way they use to tell stories on fairy tale theater.  remember that? It started off slow, and then it picked up when she found the wardrobe into the magical forest, where she met and made friends with the human elk.  BUT THEN it went back to slow and boring as she found her way back home, tried to convince her brothers and sisters, of this magical place that she just found, where they all just happened to find it later by accident while playing hide and seek.Eventually they were all on a journey to stop the ice queen from keeping everything frozen all year as well as saving one of their brothers who wandered off into the arms of the ice queen while trying to betray his kin, all because of the queens promise to make him prince, and save the elk who was captured by her for not telling her that he saw the human girl in the forest in the first place.Anyway,  I was bored and unimpressed by the ""special effects, character's wardrobe, and boring setting,"" of this movie. In fact, I actually watched part of this movie one night, and it was so uncaptivating to me, that i watched the other half a few days later just to see if there was a chance it may pick up.  While i'm sure there has to be competition from another version of this film, i am not sorry that i bought it because i am an avid collector and if anything, i look at it as another movie version of it that i am able to have knowledge of and give my opinion on by comparing the lot. I give it 3 stars being generous, because of the story itself, not for the movie at all. I know they could have been more creative with this to make it a more magical experience.

701537,"Dirt Boy was a mix bag of odd parameters infused into the story aimed at adding mystery, believability and to enhance the causation of the chain of events that led to the murders. DB is NOT a horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller that revolves around an ex-junky a one hit wonder author and the odd little town the author lives. The town and its residents are beholden to the author for the astronomical amount of money (this makes no sense) his books revenues brings to them. Mr. Matthews is a lost soul looking for understanding and forgiveness in regards to the loss of his mother in a car accident. He visits Atwater Commons to attend a two week seminar on understanding serial killers and their apprehension which is odd to say the least since his mom died in a car accident. I am not sure why this would help him heal from his loss or maybe it is some weird way for him to help understand death and its effects on people? I just don't see the link to serial killer seminar except for the book DB that he doesn't know about until he arrives in the town? Matthews character gets caught up in the Dirt Boy book and starts to investigate the books murders (I guess he was driven from the seminar) and guess what he finds ??? The story keeps getting more bizarre with his discovery from the reactions of the locals as well as the lack of a visible law enforcement presence and their actions. I was going to give some detailed info on all the bizarre quirks in this story, but that would reveal to much so I won't. This story loosely reminds me of a Stephen King story only a lot more disjointed and lacking a much needed polishing job for clarification and cohesion. I say that becauce of the small New England town feel, his older car (not a classic) and the strange story. So I've listed a few of the oddities that present themselves in this story to give you an idea of what you are up against as a guide to the bizarre nature of this story. The acting and direction are good, but as described before the story needs work and in the hands of a good writer I think that this would make for a great movie. I must say that even with all the quirks in the writing I still enjoyed this movie and its odd ball characters and its little town full of mysterious residents. I seldom will enjoy a movie that has so many quirks in the writing or a combination of issues that include acting, direction, editing and so on. I hope if you give this movie a try that you can overlook its flaws and still be able to enjoy the story as is unfolds to its conclusion. 3 starsRating 0 to 5Story = 3 The hard way.Acting = 3.5Direction = 3Fear Factor = 1Gore = .5Sex/Nudity = NO and NoFoul Language = Not muchEntertainment Value = 3",N/A

Morris Ankrum is included as a general as usual. While the  direction of Fred Sears is inconsistent and the pace of the movie drags a  bit, the special effects of Ray Harryhausen are excellent and Washington  will not see such destruction again until Independence Day or Mars Attacks.  In fact the Washington Monument is almost as played with as in Mars  Attacks, although there is no Cub Scout troop underneath.

1456968,"Okay so first off, before I even considered to watch this film. I did a number of things, I read some reviews and then watch youtube for reaction videos for the &#34;Newborn&#34; scene.It starts off fairly typical family bs. Guy use to be a porn star and wants a better life for his family(wife and little boy). So he gets the offer he can't refuse. He thinks it basic typical artsy film, but things start to get a little weird for him. There are a few scene in between with his brother and family. You can see the brother has an affection for his beautiful wife. He talks with the Missus and she basically tell him to drop out of the film. He goes to the director says no thank (at an hour in if uncut) This is where the &#34;Newborn&#34; scene takes place. It's really not as bad as it is made out to be, but does bother you little. The crying is mainly what bothered me, but it was very minor. Nothing is really shown, but it is very much implied. Your mind will create the scene. Milo (the ex porn star) still leaves and while driving, his vision goes blurred. Things go pretty south from here for poor Milo. The rest of the movie is pretty much, just connecting the memories of the night before. Milo is contentiously drugged from this point on with horny, sleeply juice. There is a scene I consider gore porn, where Milo beheads a woman while having sex. (Not very graphic or goretastic in my opinion) The only other scene that bothered me is, when Milo is taken into a room with two bodies covered on a bed, Milo is done with the larger of the two bodies and goes to the smaller. The camera shows issues and gushes of blood from the smaller body. You find out who is behind it. The ending doesn't surprise me, but it kind of right in my opinion.

422296,"You are never going to mistake ""The Phantom"" for anything more than campy fun, but it is enjoyable campy fun.  Billy Zane is just a bit goofy in the role.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the not-quite-bad bad girl Sala.  Kristy Swanson, of the original ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" movie, is swaggering girl friend Diana Palmer.  She reminds me of Princess Leia in the first Star Wars movie.  Treat Williams is corny bad guy Xander Drax.  None of these actors treat their roles seriously, and there is enough over-acting for two movies, but it all seems intentional.We learn at the beginning of the movie that most of these characters have a history that begins well before this movie.  Quill (Patrick Remar) has even killed the Phantom once.  Later we find that a lot of people have killed the Phantom.  It is sort of like a rite of passage for bad guys (and a throwaway one-liner).  Of course, we know the Phantom can not be killed.Xander Drax has attained an idea from ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  Find three mysterious skulls and achieve a power greater than any known to man.  The skulls are really cool.  When you find two of them, they burn a hole in a map to point the way to the third.  Far more efficient than having them point in a center direction so that it takes a significant portion of the movie to find the next skull.  Instead, we zip to the island, having a big fight, kill some people off and move on.  However, I am getting ahead of myself.At the outset of this movie we recognize how fun it is going to be.  The bad guys force a boy to drive a truck a rickety hanging bridge (perhaps another carry-over from ""Temple of Doom"").  The bridge threatens to break, but the boy makes it across.  During the bad guy's escape they force the boy to drive across again, but this time the bridge really does start to break and the Phantom has to rescue himself and the boy.There are later fun scenes with the Phantom rescuing Diana from a ship and escaping in a plane.  We have seen hundreds of cowboys drop from a building or a rock into a saddle.  How about the Phantom dropping from a biplane into a saddle?  The Phantom heads to New York City, proving that jungle people can survive in the Big Apple.  After all, the Big Apple is just another kind of jungle.  Billy Zane even gets to slide down elevator cables and escape just in the nick of time.This movie has all the elements of a fun adventure movie.  The characters have just the right combination of believability and unbelievability that the entertainment factor is high.  When people get hurt it is so cartoonish that you never can keep their injury in perspective.  The only drawback is that the original Phantom comics were never that campy.There are some downsides to this movie.  The plot seems to borrow way too many elements from the Indiana Jones movies, especially from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  As noted above, the camp factor was high.  This movie may have been too campy for fans of the original Phantom; not as extreme as the difference between the original Batman comics and the campy 1960s series, but similar.One interesting and fun choice for supporting actors was Patrick McGoohan as the Phantom's Dad.  McGoohan is a wonderful actor with credits in both television and movies.A viewer will not mistake this movie for something with Academy Award potential.  The movie is way too derivative.  However, it is highly entertaining as long as you do not analyze it too much.  Grab a bowl of popcorn, gather the family, and turn your brain off for a while.",N/A

590016,"This is an average film that should have been a good film.  It is unsatisfying.Upon reflection, notwithstanding the Academy Award to Julian Fellows, the problem lies with the script.  It has the wrong feel.  Robert Altman did not understand the culture being depicted, and so it is depicted through a lens that doesn't capture it accurately.  There is dialogue in the script that is just wrong.  There are accents that are wrong.  There is body language that is wrong, that does not fit properly in the class structure of that society.  It isn't badly wrong, but it is consistently wrong throughout the film. It persistently undermines the credibility of the charcters.Notwithstanding reasonable acting, the scripted portrayal of the police inspector and his sidekick is particularly weak. It is utterly ham-fisted - something that fits in an Americn film, perhaps, but not on an English country estate in the early 1930's.  If the Director has decided to make a murder mystery drama, then he needs to make up his mind to do a murder mystery drama.  It cannot include inspector Clouseau and remain a serious film. The weakness of that portrayal undermines both the seriousness of the drama, and the critique of the English class structure.  That is not the only portrayal that is ham-fisted, either.Upper class English society was then (and sometimes even now, is) about reserve, suppression of emotion, subtlety, and irony.  If you were ""in service"" you were ""in service"".  Which member of the household staff in this film behaves as if they were ""in service"" or as if they understand what the term means?  Compare the conduct of the staff in this film with, for example, ""The Remains of the Day"", which captures it far, far better.There is far too much swearing, at the wrong times, for the wrong reasons, in the wrong way, and frequently by the wrong people.We have a Jewish American film producer at an estate in the English countryside, and the problem is that he is peculiar because he is a vegetarian? In that era?  In a society then riven with anti-semitism? Who is kidding whom?His lordship is an industrial sweatshop owner?  Really?  In that era the landed class had a very strong aversion to people who were ""in trade"".  This fellow had multiple illegitimate children with working girls in his sweatshops? Are you doing Dickens, or are you doing Jane Austen?  Make up your mind.Meanwhile his wife cavorts with the staff of strangers at the drop of a hot glass of milk? The scullery maid services every man in the place down in the kitchens, and hasn't been fired long since? Again, who is kidding whom?It's too much.  Way, way, way too much. That concatenation of improbabilities adds up to several shark-jumpings.At the end of the day, it is rooted in a basic problem: The director does not understand the society he is trying to depict on screen, and doesn't get that his portrayal tends to caricature.  It spoils what could have been a much better film.",N/A

415873,"Featuring an outstanding numberof actors from Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Willem Defoe to David Bowie - who plays a just as convincing Andy Warhol, as Wright does Basquiat.  The movie begins as a young Jean-Michel Basquiat witnesses a painting of some sort on a wall.  Basquiat's mother (I presume) begins to cry, but then she looks down at Basquiat who is smiling as we see an image of a halo or a crown.  Maybe this is a prelude of what is about to come for her young son?  Throughout the film we see various images of a surfer surfing the ocean.  This can relate to a young up-and-coming artist in Basquiat who climbs the latter of success; rides the waves, and of course we see his perpetual and painfull downfall.  He learns many things along the way, especially that success comes with a price.  He can never shake the negative reviews that he was &quot;Warhol's hanger-on,&quot; or a &quot;Graffiti writer.&quot;  We never really know what's going on in Basquiat's head or what's fueling his artistic fire, and why he flirts with danger.  By the time that we make a pretty good asumption, again we see the image of the surfer surfing the ocean, only this time he falls and is swallowed by the waves.

1541545,"Several months ago I shelled out $5 or so for this movie which was on Blu ray.  I didn't know anything about it other than its cast consists of 3 of the best actresses of their generation.  As it turns out the film was a bomb at the box office and with the critics.  On a boring afternoon, I was looking for something that I didn't have to think about too much and certainly didn't feel like reading subtitles, so I pulled out this film from the summer of 2012.Directed by Oscar nominee Bruce Beresford (""Tender Mercies""), the film is a by-the-numbers family drama, complete with generational conflict, romance, break-ups, and reconciliation.  Catherine Keener plays Diane, a successful, but uptight, New York attorney whose fed up husband (Kyle MacLachlan) walks out on her.  Neither is upset about it as they stopped loving each other long ago.  Diane decides to go visit her hippy mother, Grace (Jane Fonda) who still resides in Woodstock, N. Y. never having left after the first historic musical event in 1969.  And by the looks of the town, all the residents remain 60 something hippies protesting the war, any war, still dressed in psychedelic clothing.Diane brings her 2 kids with her.  Jake (Nat Wolff) is a mid-teen obsessed with a video camera.  Zoe (Elizabeth Olsen) is a college student who has degree of arrogance about her that almost matches Diane's.  Diane hadn't seen her mother for 20 years due to a falling out years earlier.  Grace is a free spirit, then and now.

1414755,"1996 is such a guilty pleasure type of a year for me.  No matter how many `important' films I see from that year, my heart is always drawn back to that handful of Blockbusters that made a giant splash in with the box-office and won the hearts of the general public.  Whether we're talking about De Palma's avant-garde approach to Ethan Hunt, Baz's brilliant take on Shakespeare or that 60's inspired slice of crowd pleasing pie, `That Thing You Do', I'm sold.  I bought the ticket.  I'm in the seat.  I'm smiling WIDE.  There is another film that made a huge dent the world of cinema that was released that very same year.  Wes Craven's magnum opus; `Scream'.  I know that is a pretty big statement to make, but there are few films PERIOD that have had the same effect on modern cinema as `Scream' has.  The effect has not always been a good one, sure, but it was a BIG one and it still makes ripples in cinema even today, fifteen years after it was originally released.In the latest installment of this series we are reunited with the surviving members of the original `Scream' yet again for a bloody good time.  Instead of trying to create something brand new, `Scream 4' takes on the idea of remaking the original, only with new technology.  A lot of the scenes and plot points and murders are ripped straight from the 1996 original, only with a little tweak here and there to represent the year in which this was made.  So, expect Facebook references and webcams capturing the murders in real time.  Where this is an interesting idea on the outset, it does at times feel redundant and a tad stale.  I wasn't wholly impressed with the way that the party sequence played out.  For as much as they are trying to `one up' the original (a concept stated with obviousness quite a bit) they don't really do that.  Instead they regurgitate scenarios that lack the same wow factor that saturated the original.Remember the garage door scene in the original `Scream'?  So much more terrifying than the one in `Scream 4'.  Do you remember Drew Barrymore's opening scene in `Scream'?  So much more terrifying than the one in `Scream 4'.I'll give `Scream 4' the twist factor, since it was one I didn't expect considering that there were so many other variable options for a killer that seemed more obvious and then when the killer is revealed it seems the most obvious of all, which is rather fascinating in a way.  But, the film's desire to prove a point about instant celebrity status and the obvious deterioration of today's youth is lost in the killer's monologue, which is delivered in a near comical fashion that comes off somewhat stupid.  Maybe the intention was to make the average fame hungry teenager seem crazy, but it felt forced and more like a poorly executed plot point than anything else.But I will say this; I have a newfound respect for Hayden Panettiere, who was all sorts of awesome in this.",N/A
623612,"I like to feel that I am balanced in my scorn of cod-science. For some reason, some people have taken offence to my review of ""State of Fear"", the Michael Crichton stinker. Ok, TDAT takes some pretty sound scientific principles and drives a bus through them to get a plot out of it. Lets be fair, no one is going to say ""oh My God, I`m going to be crushed by that rapidly advancing glacier if I stay routed to this spot for the next couple of thousand years"", so I can allow them their scientific whimsies for dramatic purposes. But I was able to ignore the science (and as an environmental scientist who does this stuff every day, if I can do it, so can you) enough to enjoy the film for what it is, an Independence Day type of disaster movie, and to be fair, probably more plausible than being invaded by aliens (which is kind of disappointing as I recently enjoyed a screening of ""V-The Mini-series"" on Sci-Fi Channel recently).On the science front, I would place it as equivalent to cloning dinosaurs from extinct DNA, sounds sorta pseudo science possible, but actually we are unlikely to be over-run by velociraptors on our way to do the Christmas shopping next year. And if you are, like TDAT's tidal waves, a simple revolving door should keep you safe.One thing I hope isn't true is that the makers of the film were asked to speak to Congressional Hearings on Climate Change. I don't think the film sets out to be ""An Inconvenient Truth"" with special effects, just a popcorn enhancing flick.

He's a successful solictor; she is the wife who wants to please him at the cost of her own happiness.  When the husband of their housekeeper is killed by a hit and run driver, events are set in motion that will change their lives.The movie doesn't have enough suspense to be a thriller, but it does examine what one might do to protect a loved one and/or their reputation.  Wilkinson and Watson are superb in their roles, both showing a wide range of conflicting emotions.  Rupert Everett, looking rather ill, does a good job in his underplayed role of their neighbor William Buell.SEPARATE LIES is not a great film by any means; it's lethargic and the second half meanders a lot.

607847,"An oft-repeated phrase throughout this film is that with the CIA, nothing is what it seems.  Unfortunately, that is not always true.  If this film seems to drag a bit at times, that is what it seems.  If it seems a bit repetitive and lacking in originality in dialogue and plot situations, that is what it seems.  If it seems that the star power of Al Pacino and Colin Farrell aren't enough to raise this film from B-film levels, that is what it seems.Farrell is supposed to be a techno-geek.  Okay, most techno-geeks I know do not look like Colin Farrell even on Farrell's worst day.  So, suspension of disbelief is required from the outset (one can make the same criticism of Keanu Reeves in the Matrix films, but those were much better films).  Farrell as James Clayton is a programmer geek by day, sexy bartender by night (that part is convincing).  Clayton is the sort of person that Walter Burke (played by Pacino) seems to want in the CIA, so he sets out to recruit him.  Clayton has a secret buried in his past - his father disappeared, and he always suspected that it was a CIA or some similar agency operation that caused it.Forward to 'the farm', a training ground for CIA operatives.  Most people wash out, and Clayton (apparently) does, too.  However, he is then recruited again by Burke to be a super-sleuth - the kind of operative that works off the books and under the radar.  The mission is to secure a computer programme capable of taking over virtually the entire plugged-in world, which exists in the computers of the agency, but nowhere else.  Of course, the computers at the agency don't have disc drives or printers or any other such storage devices to make theft easy.This is the first point at which the story goes off the rails, because the theft mechanism appallingly simple, and we find during at least one scene that the agency's computers are internet-linked to an agent's home computer.  So much for not being able to get information off the reservation.  But I digress.Farrell's confused acting put together with Pacino's overacting lead to a less-than satisfying, anticlimactic denouement.  There are plots within plots, and, true to form, the storyline tries to craft each person as being not what he or she seems, except that the viewer can figure out fairly quickly who is and is not in the frame.The deleted scenes don't add much to the overall experience of this film, and the final scene, alas, is definitely a set-up for a sequel, should we ever be so unlucky as to find this being made.If it seems that there was potential for this film, between the actors and the idea, that is what it seems.  Unfortunately, it seems that the film could never decide whether to be a mystery or an action film.  In the end, it comes close without quite reaching the level of being good at being either.One thing that might be worthwhile is the featurette, 'Spy School:  Inside the CIA Training Program' - however, does anyone really believe that the agency is going to put very much of high security value out before the public on a mass-market DVD?  Again, nothing is as it seems.This would be a great film to be remade a decade or two from now, with a better script and tighter plot, and a decision as to whether it is in the action or the mystery genre.",The Recruit
724267,"The Barber (Michael Bafaro, 2002)Like at least half the other people who have watched and reviewed this, I picked it up (a) because it contains Michael McDowell and (b) expecting it to entirely suck. And like at least half of those, I ended up being very pleasantly surprised; while it's as predictable as they come (and that's not usually a good thing in a murder mystery), it's black comedy pedigree is long, and for once a low-budget director actually put together a cast of people you've never heard of by asking the question, ""who can we get for this movie who won't look like a seventh-grader in a school play next to Malcolm McDowell?"" The results are not only gratifying, but should be required viewing for aspiring low-budget murder-mystery directors who use their entire budgets on one big name until the end of time. (You think that's a vertical market? I just described 90% of the movies on the Lifetime Movie Network. Think about it.)Dexter (McDowell) is the barber in a small town of Revelstoke, Alaska, well above the Arctic Circle and plunged into darkness for large portions of the year. (More on this later.) As the movie opens, a couple of drunk hunters stumble across the body of Lucy (Jennifer Martinez in her first screen role), wife of the town eccentric and dispatcher for the local cab company. (This town is big enough to have a cab company?) Corgan (Unforgiven's Jeremy Ratchford), the town sheriff, starts to investigate, but the next day, the FBI, in the form of Agent Crawley (Get Carter's Garwin Sanford), arrives and takes over the case. The deeper we get into the investigation, the more interesting dirt turns up. But then a second body appears, and both Crawley and Corgan begin to unravel things--but both of them have different prime suspects.From the reviews I've read, it seems to me that the division between the movie's viewers is along a very clear line: whether you viewed this movie as a comedy or not. Those who went into it expecting a straight serial killer film are inevitably disappointed, but those who went with the dry humor enjoyed it a great deal more. Food for thought. Bafaro (11:11, The Devil's Ground) is a capable director, but not much more than that, so the film relies almost solely on its acting for strength, and a lot of the folks to be found here deliver. But then, when you've got Alex from A Clockwork Orange and the Schofield Kid from Unforgiven going head to head, it's not exactly your normal no-budget movie, is it?If you're going to be outraged about something, make it the ways in which the truth gets stretched here. Revelstoke, for example, is actually in British Columbia, not Alaska, and is pretty well below the arctic circle (it's along the Trans-Canada Highway, and is at roughly the same latitude as Calgary, AB (were you to move it due east, that would be about three hundred miles north of the tip of Maine, give or take). And despite what Steve Niles may tell you, there is no thirty days of night to be found anywhere on the American landmass, much less the seemingly endless time posited by Bafaro (per Barrow's wikipedia entry, the shortest day of the year still experiences three hours of twilight). But picking on the acting, as some reviewers I've seen so, is simply wrong, and picking on a low-budget filmmaker for making a low-budget film is senseless. If you picked it up at your local big-box store for $2.50 expecting Casablanca, that's your fault, not the movies. For those of us with lower expectations, it's not a bad little film. Not the best thing I saw last week, but certainly not the worst. ** 1/2",The Barber
830118,"This film had a lot of potential. Beautiful cinematography, PERFECT mood settings, very nice acting (with the exception of this one crazy chick... who was incredibly over the top.)

None of the music is especially interesting and it sometimes slows the momentum of the story.As far as the acting goes, everyone comments on Kelly and Crosby, but Holden is the pro here.  He gets taken for granted because he's done this role so many times and he makes it look easy.  Granted, Crosby is a revelation, but it's more because he is playing so much against type.  And Kelly is doing her best Ingrid Bergman impersonation.  I swear she even takes on Bergman's accent.  It just left me thinking how much better Bergman would have been in the role.  The fact that she won the Oscar just shows that politics win Academy Awards.

Mine was the first print graphic novel edition, which the owner of a comic book store recommended and sold to me after my reading of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns inspired me with the desire for more of this genre.I read Watchmen 3 times in that first month in 1988.The movie was anticipated with great expectation when it was announced some 19 years later.The movie, unfortunately, changed the original plot.The &#34;master stroke&#34; (chapter XI, page 27, top pane of the orginal novel) of Adrian Veidt (Ozymandius) brought upon New York City and the world is the irreplaceable moment in the novel, which makes everything come to its denouement.

Occaissionally it was minor interferrence (like &quot;The Stranger&quot; or &quot;Touch Of Evil&quot;).  Frequently is was outright (possibly malicious) butchery like &quot;...Ambersons&quot;, or &quot;...Shanghai&quot;.But &quot;Othello&quot; seems to fall into the category of stupidity and incompetence.  It's theoretically possible there was something wrong with the DVD I received, but I doubt it.  Apparently, running out of money, Welles hired a low-end post-prod house, who used their worst staff to complete this film.Thirty five years later it was restored (not completely, unfortunately), had is musical score reconstructed and re-recorded, and it's tracks re-mixed.  Unfortunately there wasn't much they could do abut the dialog, which remains muffled and often out of sync.But to the FILM:The score is STUNNING.  The Images are STUNNING.  What's left of the performances is good to excellent.  Othello is Welles flexing his design muscles beyond the pyrotechnics of Kane and Touch of Evil.&quot;Othello&quot; is essentially a series of perfectly composed static shots -- very much like an Eisenstien film (Alexander Nyevsky or Ivan The Terrible come immediatly to mind).  Shot in a real Castle, and brilliantly photographed by at least three DOPs, I think it may be the best designed of all Welle's films.  Here Welles doesn't use the long take, or mise-en-scene to get himself out of trouble: it's all editing, dramatic compositions and lighting.And once again he shows himself to be the master.The music is still extrodinary. The transcribing and re-recording are wonderful, and the soundtrack should be released as a seperate item.  Think &quot;The Haunting&quot; (Robert Wise), with touches of Bernard Herrman and you'll get the idea.

1008841,"Robert Mitchum's loner cool, Jane Russell's breasts and Howard Hughes' obsessiveness might be all there are to this odd, dull noir, but then there's Vincent Price. He plays, as if born to the part, a ham of an actor who befriends Mitchum when Mitchum could really use some help. With Vincent Price deliberately overacting, Hughes and His Kind of Woman got lucky, turning a disaster into simply an oddity.But that's not saying much. What Hughes came up with after taking the movie away from director John Farrow is a mishmash of poor craftsmanship and the forced joining of some decent noir scenes with low quality comedy. Hughes winds up with Mitchum and Russell in a Mexican resort, not a bad thing at all, but also with Raymond's Burr's bulging eyeballs and psycho brutality, a hypodermic filled with nasty Nazi fluid, a sinking rowboat filled with ""comically"" inept Mexican police officers, a facial transplant in the works, Tim Holt as a Fed agent, gravel-voiced Charles McGraw as a gunzel, Price hamming it up and Russell singing something titled ""Five Little Miles from San Berdoo."" The movie starts promisingly, loses its way for well over an hour and then ends with viciousness and belly laughs. His Kind of Woman is a movie almost as odd as Howard Hughes was.What's the story? Dan Milner (Robert Mitchum), a loner down on his luck, stops at a diner late one night for a glass of milk he can't pay for, then meanders down the street to his rented room. He's met by three thugs who beat him up. Then he gets offered money if he flies down to a small resort on the Mexican coast to await further orders. He'll be part of a scheme involving a deported top gangster, Nick Farraro (Raymond Burr), who needs a new identity to return to the States. Dan shrugs and goes. On the way he meets Lenore Brent (Jane Russell), a singer who is determined to marry rich. She's headed to the same resort to hook up with Mark Cardigan (Vincent Price), famous Hollywood adventure star, who is down there for a spot of shooting and relaxation while his wife gets a divorce.The ennui sets in when Dan and Lenore get settled at the resort. The movie lasts for two long hours, and a good deal of that time is spent getting to know a number of the guests, a good many of whom have nothing much to do with the story line. There's even a young hubby with a gambling problem being taken to the cleaners. Dan steps in and cleverly turns the tables. He gets a chaste kiss by the young wife as thanks as the couple happily leave the resort.Then the movie starts getting serious again with Nick arriving in a yacht. Dan changes his mind and fights back, Lenore gets worried and Mark with his rifles sets out to rescue Dan from the yacht. Price uses all his hammy skills to play the hammy Mark, and he gives Mitchum a run for his money. Unfortunately, we keep cutting back to Mitchum creeping around the yacht, Mitchum being pounded in the stomach, Mitchum being whipped with a belt and Mitchum almost...almost...but not quite...being injected by a white-haired medical war criminal with a serum which will erase Dan's memory, destroy his brain within a year, and keep his face intact until it can be used by Nick the psycho gangster. The movie takes this seriously. Then add Mark playing slapstick hero. What on earth was Howard Hughes thinking about?Well, we know he was thinking about Jane Russell and her 38D bust. He makes sure this actress, who he was determined would be a big star, is photographed with loving skill. As for Russell, the movie is so schizoid she's hardly given a chance to show what she can do. She has two songs, neither of them very good. What she does well is to project her natural good humor. She's sexy in the standard Hollywood style, but she never seems to really take herself too seriously. She works well with Mitchum, who manages to hold his own simply because his laid-back, tough style never really depended on the movies he was cast in.His Kind of Woman isn't much of a noir, although it starts promisingly. It's not much of a movie, either, because it mixes so oddly and unconvincingly violence and low comedy. However, Mitchum is always Mitchum, Russell has a fine, honest personality despite the cantilevered bras Hughes designed for her, and Price is a good sport.",N/A

The movie has nice visual touches (like the food-oriented opening credits) and some funny moments, a few even inspired (the sign-language version of ""The Rose"", the chicken farm scenes). It's also admirable that director Jared Hess (who co-wrote the movie with his wife Jerusha) goes neither the smutty nor the slasher route in drawing viewer attention. However, your enjoyment of this film will depend strictly on your ability to relate to a series of episodes that play out like one of those 1950's education films on how to behave on a prom date but reset to present-day, small-town Idaho. For me, the plights of the title character and his friends Pedro and Deb just aren't interesting enough to hold my attention. Accentuating the void is the fact that they are called upon to look very stilted and speak in deadpan, monotone voices. While amusing for about five minutes, it stretches an 86-minute movie into something that feels interminably longer.Jon Heder certainly looks the part of the supreme geek outsider with his red `fro, aviator glasses and polyester prom suit. But his character is simply not fleshed out enough to root for his success, as he avoids eye contact when he talks and encourages the abuse he gets from the more popular kids. As Napoleon's new best friend from Mexico, Efren Ramirez plays Pedro, who has no qualms about asking a popular girl out or running for class president. Former big-time child actress Tina Majorino (she was the little map-tattooed girl in ""Waterworld"") portrays Deb as a painfully shy girl who fancies herself as an Annie Liebowitz-type of photographer. They're all quirky enough, but you simply pay attention to these characters because no one else will. Usually someone like Napoleon would have a successful big brother to taunt him, but instead we have 32-year old Kip played with equal deadpan style by a pale-white Aaron Ruell. Kip spends most of his free time in online chat rooms and ultimately has a fanciful romance with his cyber-girlfriend, Lafawnduh. In fact, if you wait for the ending credits to finish, they even have a pastoral wedding. While the idea is funny, the ludicrous nature of the relationship feels overly contrived. Providing more honest laughs is Jon Gries as the moronic, self-proclaimed lady-killer Uncle Rico. With his 1980's-style toupee and constantly flexing his non-existent muscles, he lives in past gridiron glories that probably never happened, even buying a mail-order time machine to transport him back. His new career selling Tupperware makes for a couple of funny scenes.In fact, there are several amusing ideas, but they don't seem to add up to anything that memorable by the poignant tetherball-swinging end. One almost longs for the return of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles"". Even the climax is oddly unfulfilling as Pedro's presidential aspirations hinge on Napoleon displaying some pretty impressive dance moves to a song by Jamiroquai. The DVD includes four deleted scenes and a black-and-white short called ""Peluca"", which stars Heder and provides the basis for the movie. There is also audio commentary by the director, Heder and producer Jeremy Coon. This is the first time I encountered a DVD that uses both sides to provide the full and widescreen versions, but it also means you need to flip your disc to see all the features.

The characters looked weird and some of them even scary, there was no life to their faces and eyes, I just couldn't really connect with anything.And the dancing waiters? FREAKY hahaHalf way through the movie I was sitting there wondering what was the point, it's a kid on a train getting himself into problems, some problems didn't even make sense.

1043516,"When I saw the previews for Flags of Our Fathers, I was excited for a couple of reasons.  First, I am a World War II buff, but have studied the European theater and want to know more about the war in the Pacific - the so-called American War, as it was linked directly to an attack on Americans at Pearl Harbor.Secondly, my great uncle was a Marine involved in the island hopping campaign to reach Japan.  I have heard stories of what it was like and wanted this film to add to those stories.While there were parts of the film that were interesting, the information was not woven together in a cohesive final product.  Little vignettes of action that were supposed to help tell the story of the fight for Iwo Jima end up being snippets of what is really one of the most compelling fights in American history, and the definitive Marine battle of all time.When you read the book, you really understand why the fight for Iwo was so important.  You find out why 70,000 men were sent to this little spit of land to fight and die.  The atrocities committed by the Japanese both before and during World War II are explained and add a prelude to the hell that the Marines knew they would face once they reached the beaches.The structure of the island fortress - considered one of the most heavily armed fortresses in history - is explained, giving the feeling that the Marines were lucky to win the battle, even after 36 days of tortuous fighting.The idea that the picture of the flag raising could give a nation hope is understandable, especially given the era and the painful four years leading up to the battle.But the film - well, it just goes off in it's own direction, with Clint Eastwood's help of course.  Where do I begin?  Well, war is hell and not as simple as it seems from the history books.  OK - got that.  These men were not looking to be set up as heroes, but were thrust into the spotlight for the good of a voracious government war machine that needed heroes to convince the public to continue financing a horrendously expense battle for the benefit of the free world.  Check.  Life back home was not a bed of roses.  Roger.But none of that really tells the story of what happened at Iwo Jima.  It doesn't even really tell the story of what happened to these three boys at Iwo Jima.  It touches on the issue, but it leaves the battle as a secondary item on Eastwood's agenda, which seems to be to tell us that our young soldiers end up as grist for the public mill.  That the press uses a good story for it's own benefit, even if the truth must be distorted a bit.  That the government doesn't really care about the real truth as long as it can use the boys for propaganda purposes.Well, in case no one understands the history of WWII, the fight was one we had to win.  The Japanese military leaders were murderous in their techniques, their teachings, and their actions.  Find the book and read the section about the slaughter in China, before we entered the war, where 350,000 civilians were slaughtered in one month (correct, one month).If three young men could capture the hearts of the American people and move the war to a speedier conclusion, then that was more important than those three men and their privacy or personal feelings.  As Marines who professed to be fighting for the sake of their fellow Marines, they should have understood that wars are won (and fellow soldiers saved) on the home front as well as on the battlefield.  The personal sacrifices of the publicity tour at home were a small price to pay for the thousands of lives saved due to a shortened war.If only Clint Eastwood had been able to clarify that issue.  Instead he seems to want to show us that these poor pitiful boys were just pawns in the hands of the Corp and the US government.  What a wasted opportunity, however politically correct in this current age.",N/A

1349017,"Horror films hardly ever end well, and that applies to the genre in more ways than one.  Barring some pretty revolutionary stuff to arrive during the 70's and 80's, it's been the 21st century that introduced us to the nihilistic torture porn; an offbeat resurgence of snuff, but still characteristically modern.  Well, to no one's surprise, with this kind of source material came some truly bleak concepts and franchises that still influence horror to this day, and likely will for at least another decade.The point is, with this bleakness arose an abrupt halt to those feel-good horror films that give the protagonists a free ride home, and even exhilarate the audiences with a fleeting glimpse of a sequel.  Nope.  Here, things hardly ever end well and, if you can guess what the other side of the coin may entail, both are something that Stamm's Exorcism struggles with.I feel obligated to let you know that things end abruptly and in undramatic fashion.  Don't ever forget this, and you will thank yourself by the time the credits start rolling.  Like any carnival of terror, it's not the departing that's worth remembering, but the arrival and experience; every jump and chill shouldn't be forgotten.  To hell with the sudden (bittersweet?) revelation that it was all an illusion as you walk into the bristling sunlight.Okay, well...keep that in mind because, unfortunately, The Last Exorcism needs to come to a close and while the results feel shockingly brief and uninspired, this is a thriller - in a horror's guise, no less - that knows where it's going for 95% of the time, and does so with grace.So, it is scary?  Definitely.  It's restrained, to be sure and, although that may have been used as a barometer in the past to separate the good horror from the bad, it doesn't always apply here.  Nonetheless, the imagery here is memorable enough, in no small part to a terrific setting and some particularly clever elements in association with the docu-style that's seldom exploited, so those who fear motion sickness can feel relieved.Hardly a faux documentary in the strictest sense of the word, Stamm's exorcism feels, nonetheless, like one of the more personal thrillers to emerge in years, very much due to some strikingly intriguing and powerful performances by Patrick Fabian and Ashley Bell.  Really, no matter how much of a bitter taste may be left in my mouth from its close, each and every recollection of one of Bells' show-stopping scenes brings me back down to reality, and assures me that this is something quite special.The other, Fabian, solely embodies all of the elements of the film that make it feel so unique, even if it really isn't.  There's an air of surreal horror at work here that few other films have captured on the nature of exorcism and, indeed, religion itself.  It embeds a true sense of intrigue and skepticism within all of us that's been missing in other iterations of the premise.  So many forget that Satan is understood as the father of lies and deceit.Being agnostic, it resonated with me, this analysis of his Unholy, putting the sheer might of religious belief into perspective, and the results are quite disturbing.  Needless to say, it sticks with you, this film. , and you'll be asking yourself questions that took quite some time to emerge in the first place.",N/A
163971,"Bram Stoker's Dracula? Hardly. More like MTV's Dracula where he walks around in London, wearing fashionable sunglasses. This is a Dracula where Victorian feeling in the book has been changed for stupid sex-remarks. And  a Dracula movie where the cast speaks english with an american accent  looses all credibility. Keanu Reeves is lousy and booring as Jonathan  Harker, Winona Ryder doesn't fit in at all. Only Anthony Hopkins is really  good as Doctor Van Helsing. Gary Oldman could have been good, it it wasn't  for ridiculous outfits.This movie is good for anyone that hasn't read  the books and doesn't have fond memories of the old Hammer-films with  Cristopher Lee. It has a good set (if you don't count Gary Oldmans Dracula  outfit), nice special effects and a good script. It just isn't  Dracula.See this a costly monstermovie and try to keep all the other  vampire-movies from your mind. Then you might enjoy this. As it is, it's  too much Hollywood for me.

It's 2027 and not a single birth has occurred in 18 years. The young girl is pregnant and they want to keep her safe. Mopey office man quickly bites off more than he can chew.This is a dark movie, much like 28 Days Later, except without the zombies. Lots of explosions, car chases and mass murders. Michael Cain has a small role as the most ""excellent"" best friend. Julianne Moore plays the girlfriend but don't go to see her if you're a fan. It's a very small part. Clive Owen is actually quite natural as this character especially in the one-on-one scenes with Cain.I have two peeves. The propagation of humanity problem is because of women's eggs. In the 1994 book of the same name, by author P.D. James, it was the sperm count that was affected. While I expect many changes when you transform a book into a movie, this detail bothers me.Second peeve, throughout the whole movie cats, dogs and various wildlife seem attracted to Theo. They make a point of showing it with the cinematography so I kept thinking it would come up at the end why but it never did. Even my date kept expecting something more. While the story is complete in the main story sense I felt there were gaps that may have been edited out. I'm looking forward to special features when it comes out in rentals.I'd watch it again.

1106169,"I've watched all the previous movies, so was interested to see this one also.  Like all the previous movies, though, there seems to be a certain lack of romance between the protagonists.You could almost excuse the first movie, because that was the point of the title (that love comes softly), but all the movies have that strange situation where the protagonists suddenly realize they love each other in the last few minutes of the movie (well, mostly the women..the men are pretty clear about their romantic interests).Other than that continuing strange aspect of these movies, I still enjoyed this movie, independent of the books (having not read any of them).  A couple of sobbing scenes, but  I can really imagine how tough life was for orphans in that (and this) time period.I liked Dale Midkiff before discovering him in this series, and I have to say, he rocks as a dad in these movies.

317275,"The third Roger Moore outing as Bond has some terific moments in it, that rank with some of the best in all the Bond films. The start in particular is fabulous. Bond leaves a mountain lodge and starts skiing down the mountain and is then pursued by 4 or 5 Russian agents. Bonds escape is breathtaking and was done for real (no CGI in 1977). Check the credits for the stunt-man who gets a special mention. There are other great moments as well, such as the Lotus Esprit and the first appearance by Richard Kiel as Jaws.This film repeats various elements from previous Bond films such as the fight on the train from 'From Russia with Love', the Lotus Espriteis effectively the Aston from 'Goldfinger' etc. For me though the main reason it isn't worthy of 4 or more stars is the less serious nature of the film. Roger Moore uses that irratating smile a few too many times, and the film maintains a jokey attitude throughout. To be fair its better than most of the Roger Moore Bond films that followed, where this jokey attitude got worse and worse (and Roger Moore becane too old for the part as well).However, the script is pretty good, and the sets are very impressive so overall this IS an entertaining Bond film, but not one you can take seriously.",N/A

There is a happy ending now.This film requires a belief in the idea that hypnotism can create a perfect crime. What about fingerprints?

I don't know if anyone can be hypnotized or controlled to become an assassin, like ""The Manchurian Candidate"".

1242882,"The International: 6 out of 10: The International has great timing. Not since The China Syndrome opened up 12 days before the Three Mile Island Accident, has a movie seemed so prescient (Or in The international's case ripped from the headlines.)A therein lies one of The International's two main problems. It is ripped from the headlines. The problem is the headlines in question are from 1989. The movie is about The BCCI collapse. Unfortunately the script mimics the actual late eighties scandal a little to accurately for its own good.There are clues that the script had been collecting dust for some time before the new bank crisis prompted it back in the mix. For example, one of the more famous BCCI clients was Samuel Doe, who was president of Liberia in the early eighties. Not exactly ripped from the headlines stuff, but the International doggedly creates a General Charles Motomba, played gamily by Lucian Msamati, who takes over Liberia with the banks help. Something that makes little sense in a year that starts with a two.In another, what decade is this again moment, the hit man uses a payphone after receiving what appears to be a beeper message. For those under 35, and not 30 Rock fans, let me explain what a beeper was. A beeper was a cell phone that did not make calls. It only received phone numbers. Then you, the recipient of a 'beep', would have to find a payphone and call the number to talk to someone.Now a payphone was a phone that the public would use instead of their own separate cell phones. They were metal and had many germs. If you visit a public transport hub, you can sometimes still find 'banks' of phones.If it seems I am nitpicking, keep in mind the film itself lives in some uncanny valley between Michael Clayton and The Bourne Identity. Not nearly realistic enough for Clayton fans; and for the Bourne fans? Well there are about as many action set pieces as there are hours the film runs. (Read two) It is a surprisingly talky affair.Speaking of talking, 'Sometimes a man can meet his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.' Can someone explain that quote to me. Our rumpled protagonist says it at least twice and it makes no bloody sense either time.In addition, speaking of not making sense' late in the film in Istanbul (not Constantinople) one bad guy says to the other let me show you a something few man have seen and proceeds to take him to the Basilica Cistern. You know that underground canal featured In From Russia with Love and maybe the second Indiana Jones film and is one of Turkey's biggest tourist attractions. This makes about as much sense if he said it about the Statue of Liberty. (There is this statue; in the harbor, few men have seen my friend.)Overall, the acting, direction and cinematography are decent.

The story mostly plays as a big screen production, but at times devolves into moments of forced drama, melodramatic like one would see on the big stage.

I did seen Darkman III first, however, and enjoyed it more; perhaps  because I enjoyed Jeff Fahey as a bad-guy more than I did Larry Drake.  They do say that the quality of the villain makes the film.  I also thought  Mr. Vosloo's Darkman was more brittle in II than in III.  Perhaps the  quality of the bad guy effected his performance too, or maybe he was just  getting used to his character and the series and was only  beginning to  develop his own particular point of view on both.

It is one of those films I would describe as an ""enjoyable little film"".The film does not try to be something it is not; it is a story about two women at a crossroads in their separate lives and how friendship can move them past tragedies in their lives.The two lead characters are interesting in that you have an American lady who has closed herself off from everyone who wants to help her after the death of her son.  We also have an Irish lady (Ria) who after finding out about her husband's infidelity looks to friends and family for support, only to find they blame her for his affairs (or at least that is how she feels). By switching lives for short period of time they both hope they can find the answers they need.The story is entertaining and I enjoyed the performances by most of the supporting actors.  Unfortunately I did not enjoy the performances of the leading actors; Andie McDowell and Olivia Williams.  Andie's performance just did not seem to fit this character.  There were moments when her character would look into the camera and you would expect her to convey the emotion of the moment, but it was not there.I think part of the problem may have been with the directing or the storytelling.  Their seemed to be pieces missing, especially in Ria's life in America.  I have not read the book so if there are parts of the story missing they were lost in the movie.Neither of the lead women seemed to capture the tragedies that happened in their lives, they just seemed odd.  I see this movie mainly appealing to those who like romantic comedies.  If you do, or you are an Andie McDowell fan, then you will enjoy this movie.",Tara Road

I've always liked horror movies and this is one of the only horror franchises that I've made the effort to see in the theater on opening night.The theater was packed with people, even though it was a midnight showing.As I watched the events of Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) and Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and the ruthless Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) unfolding in front of me, I realized that the Saw franchise had turned a corner, and not in a positive direction.This movie wasn't great, and it wasn't terrible, but just about every plot device was already used in Saw II. The quick MTV-style scene cuts are here, the gory and marvelously inventive traps are here, and if that's what you want to see, you won't be disappointed.The ""Twist"" ending, however, is fairly predictable, especially to anyone who has already seen the previous Saw movies.As the theater patrons left, everyone was saying pretty much the same thing - discussing traps, the amount of blood & gore, etc. However, one person said ""It didn't feel new.""This movie reminded me of my 16 year old dog - he had vision problems, his hind legs didn't work well, and even though all the signs of old age were there, I still loved him, right up to the end.If you're a die-hard Saw fan, you'll probably see it in the theater like I did...but you might find yourself wondering how much life the franchise has left in it.",N/A

525677,"(Note: this review is of the movie as released in theaters, not of the DVD, which promises to come out with several more hours of deleted scenes.)I just saw HP for the second time in the theaters yesterday, after practically memorizing all four books.  My brother and I were quite disappointed, while my mother enjoyed it.  Probably because she'd never read the books.The difficulty I had with the movie is that it made *such* an effort to be true to the book, that the 90% of the book that was cut for time was all the more obvious and disappointing.  The end result was a set of disjointed scenes that contained the bare minumum of information that the screenwriters could convey and still advance the plot.Most of the character development (and actually, several of the *characters*) was cut for time.  All dialogue was so intent on getting the needed information to the audience in as short a time as possible, that the conversations seemed forced - quite unlike the natural flow of the book's dialogue.  And the humor - one of the biggest strengths of the books - was eliminated almost entirely (Fred and George, for example, had a grand total of three short scenes and two jokes).  The most touching scenes of the book (Dumbledore's &quot;she loved you&quot; exchange with Harry at the end, and Hagrid's gift of the pictures of Harry's parents) were present, but rushed and not developed, and so they carried no emotional impact.  Particularly since the movie cut most of the information that would have gotten across just how starved for love Harry had been with the Dursleys.As for the acting, it was passable.  Harry's actor needs some work.  Ron and Hermione are well played, as are Snape, Quirell, and Hagrid.  Dumbledore (what little we saw of him) was well-played, but seemed considerably more tired than I pictured.  I saw no twinkle in his eyes, and he wasn't nearly as inspiring as in the books.Most of my problems relate to the cutting, which was of course necessary because of time constraints.  I just hate to see what they'll do to Book 4..",N/A

If you can make it past the first half hour you'll probably finish it as it does manage to keep your interest in spite of the fact that it's cliched and formulaic to the hilt.  The 'Harrison Ford just back from Star Wars' factor will be enough for most people.  If you don't take it too seriously (and beleive me, you won't) it almost has a campy kind of entertainment value, i.e. you'll be laughing when the characters are speaking serious lines (see title of this essay).  In spite of that, it won't be the worst way you ever killed two hours.  The action sequences manage to generate a bit of suspense even though things are a bit too tidy and convenient for there to be any trace of beleivablity.

Weaver is particularly effective as the film plays on viewer's emotions and for a good period of time, one doesn't know at all who's to blame and who deserves pity.There's not much in the way of directorial touches that scream out POLANSKI, but as in ""Repulsion"", he milks the isolated setting for all it's worth.",Death & The Maiden VHS

1456364,"Howard Marks (Rhys Ifans) grew up in a Welsh village, went to Oxford a relative innocent, and emerged from university as a fully-fledged drug smuggler.  He subsequently went on to become one of Britain's most celebrated (notorious?) drug barons, leading an exuberant lifestyle while successfully evading most attempts at capture.  Bernard Rose's biopic encourages us to admire Rose's chutzpah, as he encounters a variety of shady characters, including practicing IRA member Jim McCann (David Thewlis, speaking in an eccentric Irish accent), and American cartel owner Ernie Combs (Crispin Glover).  The film's tone remains lighthearted throughout, and there are some convincing scenes where modern-day actors are inserted into authentically Seventies archive scenes (complete with washed-out colors).  But in truth MR. NICE does not have that much to say, either about the ethics - if there can be such a thing - of drug-smuggling, nor about the lengths to which people will go to try and evade customs-officers of various countries.

1252510,"I was beginning to hold out some hope (however little) that the Oscars might have been steering away from political correctness and social appeasement when, last year,Slumdog Millionairetook home 8 of the 10 categories it was nominated in, including Best Picture. A ""feel-good"" movie made on a $15 million budget with no-name actors, it came out of nowhere and blindsided many viewers and Academy voters. Pleasantly surprised, I flipped on the Oscars this year (2010) and watched the who's who for films in 2009.I'm not going to take any large swings as THE HURT LOCKER because it was a good movie. I enjoyed the action, the tension, the acting. It was all nicely pulled together. But, out of the ten Best Picture nominees this year, was it really the stand-out? I felt that the Academy was slipping, once again, into the realm of trying to be ""significant"" and ""modern"" by voting for something that's on everyone's mind (the war in Iraq). Again, the movie was okay. Good. Adequate. But head-and-shoulders above such films asInglourious Basterds?District 9?Up in the Air? I humbly disagree that it was. And there was nothing in it that we haven't seen before: a war movie with internal angst and a man lost amidst society when he returns home. Jeremy Renner (28 Weeks Later) did a fine job as the risk-taking Sergeant James but, again, he was channeling every other warrior brought into a tough situation that we've seen on celluloid a gazillion times.From reading what you've read of my review so far, you might think that I'm being more critical of the Academy than the film. That's partially correct. But when so much attention is heaped upon one film (including Best Director ...which we'll cover in a moment) and so many people think that this is ""the film to watch"" and not the other nominees that won little or nothing, I believe of informing those who might choose to read this of their folly should they not see something like District 9 or -- one that didn't even get mentioned --Moon.Let's hit on the Best Director item...No female director has ever won an Oscar before Kathryn Bigelow did for The Hurt Locker. So what! We never elected a black President before Obama. Does that mean we should give him every break just because no other black man has ever sat in the White House? No! You win because you deserve to win, not because it's never happened to someone of your kind before. Was the directing of The Hurt Locker better than Inglorious Basterds? Was it? Sorry, but I completely disagree if you think it was.I will say that I'm glad AVATAR didn't win Best Picture or Best Director. But to completely blank out such phenomenal films as DISTRICT 9 and other worthy competitors is simply ridiculous.I think it's important for me to say here that I completely support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; they risk their lives daily so that I can live the life I do over here in the U.S. They risk they're lives so that I can write something like this about a film they may care deeply about. But caring deeply about a subject like The Hurt Locker and elevating it above other films does a disservice to the art of film-making and film-makers when you over-rate a movie based on it's significance in the world today and not on its art.For me, the top films of 2009 were DISTRICT 9, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and MOON. Two got a smidgin of notice and one never saw the light of the Oscar ballots. Check those films out before deciding where the awards should've landed for movies made in 2009. Please.",N/A

Now, I don't say ""mundane"" in a bad way. The subjects of these films are things that could happen to me, you or anyone we know. They are infinitely easier to relate to your own real world conflicts and experiences. There are no easy resolutions.There are misunderstandings, hard feelings and none of it is terribly exciting, but it is important to you at the time. These films are a great snapshot of real life - or as real as you can get in a film. The characters are appealing, charming and real. There's no omniscient narrator providing insight into their thoughts -- so it is a bit more work.Since I had not read the synopsis in a while, I kept thinking ""OK, is this going to be a crush between Natacha & Jeanne"" or maybe the antagonism between Natacha and her dad's girlfriend was due to an attraction or history between the two (ie, they dated or had a fling?).I guess 24 films at Frameline in the course of a week will change your perspective on ambitions and motivations of characters in other, perfectly straight, films.

1127020,"Awake, the new thriller by first-time director Joby Harold, takes off from a grisly real-life phenomenon called ""anesthetic awareness."" This is when patients are unaccountably left fully conscious--and physically paralyzed--during surgery, and Harold (who also wrote the script) has spun a preposterously entertaining yarn from this grisly germ of an idea, and manages to hold us in a vice-like grip for pretty much the entire film. How often can you say of a Hollywood thriller that you don't have a clue what's going to happen next? Awake is brazenly indifferent to plausibility, but you can't help but admire the film's audacity. Along with fantastic plot twists, Harold throws Hitchcockian flourishes and elements of Greek tragedy into the mix like a crazed chef. In lesser hands, Awake would have been a tawdry melodrama, but Harold believes in his material so fervently (in a way a more seasoned professional never could) that the film works on several levels at once. Ingenious as it is, it's not mechanical--it has soul.Harold brings such energy and focus to the scenes that he transcends the subject matter and gives it an almost surreal intensity, and the performances are strong enough to keep the film's nuttiness from capsizing it. Jessica Alba is suitably luscious and beguiling (her role gives new meaning to the term ""heartbreaker""), and Lena Olin and Terence Howard are both in fine form. As the unfortunate victim of anesthetic awareness, Hayden Christensen comes into his own as a performer (having mercifully managed to escape the Mark Hammil curse: that of being horribly miscast by George Lucas). Christensen has an unusually expressive face (the camera takes to him), and he can convey emotion without ever appearing to do much--fortunately, because the film hinges around his internal struggle, and on our feelings of empathy for him.Awake is a white-knuckle movie experience if ever there was one (it even carries a viewer warning), with some of the most sheerly visceral scenes of horror ever committed to celluloid. Watching someone undergoing open-heart surgery while fully conscious (and able to feel the incision) is enough to frazzle the nerves of the most hardened horror veterans, and this film is certainly not for the squeamish. Too bad the loopy plot (and the melodramatic character revelations, which are really just tired genre conventions) finally stretches our credibility to breaking point. As a result, Awake lacks a strong climax, and as a rollercoaster ride it doesn't have enough emotional depth to be fully satisfying (its shallowness is at odds with its rather contrived attempts at pathos). But for most of its length it's close to a pop classic, and probably the best metaphysical thriller since The Sixth Sense (a film I didn't much care for). In fact, Harold better watch out or he may wind up as the next M. Night Shyamalan. Awake has so many twists it makes you dizzy.",N/A
1658776,It's a great story in itself. The basic theme of &#34;what's worth the life of a person?&#34; comes through a little weakly and in the closing with Nick Clooney as an afterthought.  There are spots where the depth of the film fails as the intensity of emotion is frittered away by a light heartedness that is inappropriate in such a war zone.

559757,"Solid production values, exemplary location underwater photography, aname-dropping cast of vintage Hollywood celebrities, and a terrificfight between an octopus and two killers whales make ""Beyond the Door""director Ovidio G. Assonitis's ""Jaws"" horror movie rip-off ""Tentacles""worth watching. Basically, this movie concerns a giant squidterrorizing a coastal American town. This octopus doesn't discriminatewhen it comes to its diet. You can be an infant, an adult with a pegleg, a beautiful bikini clad dame, or an entire yacht itself and theeponymous predator will dine on you.Incidentally, though it isn't visible that often, the octopus looksbelievable, not like the octopus in the Ed Wood classic ""Bride of theMonster"" (1955) that Bela Lugosi flailed around with in a hilariousscene. The octopus with Lugosi was clearly phony just as it was clearLugosi was controlling every move that the octopus made. Additionally,this octopus looks better than the ""20,000 Leagues under the Sea""octopus. Happily, ""Tentacles"" isn't laughable, and Assonitis andcompany maintain a straight-faced, serious attitude toward theseshenanigans and refrain from camping up the plot.Sadly, the chief flaw in the screenplay by a quartet of scribes--StevenCarabatsos, Tito Carpi, Jerome Max, and Sonia Molteni--for thisatmospheric creature feature is the shortage of sympathetic characters.Most of the suspense is undermined because only one of the stars windsup in jeopardy. Nevertheless, any movie that opens with an infant in ababy carriage serving as the initial snack for a gigantic squid cannotbe one-hundred percent bad. Indeed, Assonitis and his scenarists do asplendid job of setting up the storyline, better than Spielberg didwith ""Jaws."" Underwater construction and the use of radio is whatprompted the squid to prey on humanity and once it has had a taste ofblood, it cannot assuage its appetite. The stalking scenes from theoctopus' perspective breed a sense of unease and eventually the sightof the squid traveling on top of the water like a submarine is kind ofcreepy. In fact, this ""Jaws"" rip-off anticipates ""Jaws 2"" byendangering a fleet of young boaters during a regatta. Unlike ""Jaws,""""Tentacles"" provides a reason for the appearance of the ravenousoctopus.After a baby in a carriage and a peg-legged sailor vanish in the oceanin separate incidents, Sheriff Robards (Claude Akins of ""Return of theSeven"") and newspaper reporter Ned Turner (John Huston of ""TheDeserter"") investigate their disappearance. The bodies for the mostpart have been reduced to skeletons. A horribly decayed corpse washesup out of the drink at one point to scare a couple necking on a boat,but the rest of the victims have had their flesh peeling from theirbones and the marrow sucked out of them. Sheriff Robards warns Turnernot to sensationalize the story until they obtain more information.Perceptively, Turner observes that it all adds up to a nightmare.Meanwhile, Mr. Whitehead, President of Trojan Construction (Henry Fondaof ""The Grapes of Wrath"") reminds Turner to not draw hasty conclusionsunless he can furnish the facts to back them up. Turner believes thatWhitehead's company and their underwater construction are to blame. Ofcourse, Turner is right, but he doesn't get an opportunity to bask inhis beliefs. Whitehead discovers that overzealous engineer John Corey(Cesare Danova of CBS-TV's ""Garrison's Guerrillas"") in an effort toaccelerate the construction violated regulations. Whitehead ordersCorey to stop his illegal activities.Turner goes out of town to consult with Will Gleason (Bo Hopkins of""The Wild Bunch"") who is a scuba diver and ocean-going expert. He hastrained two killer Orcas and sends two underwater experts to the townto investigate for him. The giant squid attacks them when they go downto check out the ocean floor. Eventually, Gleason arrives in town withhis wife to conduct the investigation himself. The day that he is noton his yacht, the octopus attacks the yacht and sinks it. In the middleof all this mayhem the squid eats Gleason's wife. Gleason brings in histwo whales. The last half-hour of ""Tentacles"" depicts the strugglebetween Gleason and his two Orcas with the huge octopus. Watching theOrcas tangle with the squid is like watching angry dogs tear into abear. During the fight, the octopus touches off an underwater avalancheand Gleason is trapped.Assonitis has made a better-than-average octopus opus, but the filmlacks the general air of terror and enough scary scenes to make it agoose-bump inducing horror chiller. Fonda confines himself to hishouse, while the Huston character and the Winters' character arebrother and sister.

Presented by WWE Films and from the director of The Midnight Meat Train, NO ONE LIVES has a cast of talented character actors: the very lovely Laura Ramsey, the always memorable Lee Tergesen, Gary Grubbs and genre-staple America Olivo. However, none of the actors are given the chance to shine due to a sore lack of character development. This movie felt more like a sequel than an introductory tale. The back story of Evans' ""Driver"" and the women in his life would have made for a far more interesting story, especially given the chemistry that existed between Luke Evans, Laura Ramsey and Adelaide Clemens, whose work I was previously unfamiliar with.The gore is excessive and the cinematography unremarkable, serving only to dilute the stronger points of first-timer David Cohen's script and borrowing more than once from Ted Demme's Silence of the Lambs visuals. The script is chocked full of familiar catchphrases, which standout even more given the sparse amount of dialogue. The humor is occasional but works, thanks to the effortlessness Luke Evans conveys in the lead role and a well-choreographed, if not misplaced, ""chick fight"".

This nonlinear fable reminds me mostly of a Robin Williams movie, Being Human and somewhat another by the same actor titled What Dreams May Come. 2001: A Space Odyssey also comes to mind, too.  It is a love story that goes cosmic, breaking through the fabric of the physical world and astral science exploring a spiritual plain.  I was expecting something more conventional in love stories and science fiction.  The opening of the movie pretty much dashed that to the rocks but in a good way demanding my mind to loosen up and go for a ride. Mayan astronomy and a fiction being written are the vehicles for bending reality. The language is not just speech but shapes, pictures, light.Hugh Jackman has to perform more emotion in this movie than the other characters and other parts he has played. He succeeds at showing a lot of range and selling this notion to us.  Rachel Weisz plays an idea wonderfully, female characters that aren't women like the rest of us. (She mostly just has to look good and fit into the story, which can be tricky because she projects a lot of presence.)  The acting is intelligent and interesting.As for production, it is admirable. In the documentary footage of how the movie was born, Darren Aronofsky and his colleagues were on a journey that burst into something different than they had originally conceived.

Well ...that and Jodi Foster (Inside Man).The cute factor is exceptionally high, so if you're not into the `cute-and-fuzzies', don't say you haven't been warned.

The story is also exceptionally trite, with hardly any danger or suspense. When Nim's dad Jack Rusoe (Gerard Butler,Beowulf & Grendel) gets `lost at sea', there's really little doubt he'll survive -- especially with the help of Galileo the Pelican.Also, when Alexandra Rover (Foster) is forced to decide between her agoraphobia and saving Nim from a life of possible solitude on an uncharted island, there's no doubt she'll overcome her fears and be forced out into the world (it's also entertaining to see how she experiences life outside of her small apartment where she types away on action-adventure books that Nim loves to read).There's not much point to the story, either. Simply exploring Nim's world is the basis for everything, but it's a fun world and one that kids will enjoy watching.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the brother's behaviour is wild (rubbing excrement into the carpet, punch outs at home, tantrums in supermarkets) - some of which does happen, but most doesn't.  No experienced parents would take their son to such situations precisely because it will precipitate such behaviour - these film parents are conveniently clueless - and that just doesn't wash. Then there's the horrific cruelty of the Australian school kids and neighbours - again all of it so over the top as to beggar belief.But the worst scene is after a particularly horrific home incident, the special needs brother Charlie (played by Luke Ford) supposedly apologises in sign language to his brother Thomas (played by Rhys Wakefield) - this just wouldn't happen. It is precisely because of Autism that Charlie would never make this cognitive leap - and in the real world - it's in this maddening knowledge - that lies so much hurt for siblings. Your brother doesn't progress - your sister doesn't get any better - and most people - including the authorities - couldn't give a toss. But this is a film - and after all that battering-ram stuff - the makers must offer you some hope...Autism has been used in movies before - and to some good effect; ""Mercury Rising"" with Bruce Willis and most famously Dustin Hoffman as the Savant in ""Rain Man"". But these were simplistic versions of the condition without any of the really nasty self-injurious stuff and effect on the family. ""The Black Balloon"" seems to want to bludgeon you over the head with only the gross stuff- and then somehow arrive at a magical point of tolerance at the end. The real world, however, is slightly different.It's not all grim of course - it isn't. There's a moment of extraordinary tenderness and one of the best 'growing up' sexy scenes I've ever seen. The gorgeous Gemma Ward plays Jackie (legs as long as the M1 motorway and a face the camera adores) who fancies the slightly odd she suspects brave Thomas (constantly defending his brother).  Along with all the other swimmers, they are at a school safety exercise lesson lying down by the poolside; she leans over him in her dripping swimsuit to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as per her instructor. He has his eyes shut - supposedly drowned. She has to apply mouth-to-mouth - up and down - blowing in air. The way the sunlight catches her wet hair - the drops falling on him - the proximity of such loveliness - the lips that nearly touch, but can't because people are watching - it's beautifully done - really ace stuff...Also on the up side is Luke Ford's performance as the Autistic Charlie - his mannerisms are very good and at times uncomfortably accurate - our boy displays some of the same. Erik Thompson and Toni Collette are gripping as the parents trying to cope and keep their family together.I'm not adverse to a difficult watch worth the difficulty, but I found this movie strangely exploitive - and for all the wrong reasons. I'll admit that anything that hurts children - especially special needs children - makes me wince and rage - so perhaps my opinion of the movie simply can't be anything other than biased. My wife thought it was brilliant - finally exposing the pain and difficulty parents of special needs children have to go through. I on the other hand would smash Mel Gibson over the head with a mallet...One review on the DVD box tells us the movie is ""...life-affirming..."" and ""...a sheer delight...""

1170853,"Given that stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are both very talented, one might expect that Baby Mama (2008) would be funnier, and more entertaining than it is.  There are some laughs, but no really big ones, in what is a moderately entertaining, tasteful, comedy with a warm romantic element, mainly due to Fey, and an understated and believable performance by Greg Kinnear.Kate Holbrook (Fey) is thirty seven, lives in Philadelphia, and because her T shaped uterus is apparently an impediment to being able to conceive a child, she turns to a fertility clinic run by Chaffee Bicknell (Sigourney Weaver), to find a surrogate mother.  Prospective mother Angie Ostrowski (Poehler) agrees to carry Kate's child, and after being artificially inseminated, apparently becomes pregnant.  Angie moves into Kate's apartment after splitting up with her common law husband Carl Loomis (Dax Shepard).  Rob Ackerman (Kinnear) the owner of a fruit smoothie establishment, begins a relationship with Kate, who keeps the surrogacy matter a secret, while she continues attending pregnancy classes with Angie.  Deception becomes the name of the game, as the scam Angie and Carl are running, becomes a court case.  Then it's baby time, as things end up happily ever after.Written and directed by Michael McCullers (SNL), the screenplay seemingly targeted at women thirty and over, is smart, and mostly plays it safe, without getting too daring, edgy or vulgar.  The ""girls night out"" scene, is about as wild as it gets.  Produced by Lorne Michaels, the film is nothing like either SNL or Fey's 30 Rock.  Poehler and Fey are both great at what they do, and are great together.  There are some slightly weird characters, but only Kate's boss Barry, played by Steve Martin, even rises to the level of being slightly annoying.  Romany Malco is quite amusing as Oscar, the overly concerned doorman at Kate's building.  Maura Tierney (ER), and Holland Taylor (Two And a Half Men) are also in the cast.Baby Mama isn't a laugh riot, but watching Tina Fey and Amy Poehler play off of each other is a good time, and there's just enough of the charming Mr. Kinnear to provide a nice romantic spark.  The film should strike an appropriate and humorously resonate note, with its intended audience.",N/A

1329822,"No, I am not reviewing this film, Chloe, based on the story line of this rather mundane (and theme done before) psychological thriller (maybe) about an upper class American family (slightly dysfunctional, of course) who when doctor mom gets ""signals"" that professor dad is cheating on her in his (and her) old age (40-50 something, okay) who gets catch up in the thrall of what is euphemistically called a high end escort (a.k.a. ""hooker"", call girl, etc.). That's enough detail about the plot.What really interests me about this film is the sub-theme, the inter-generation lesbian theme that is rather graphic in its depiction. Here escort Chloe, through a series of machinations, beds doctor mom. And old lady doctor mom (and Chloe) likes it. Now the only reason that that theme resonates with me right now is that I have recently read Lillian Hellman's play The Children's Hour and seen the film (the 1961 version under that same name). That play and film with a very different plot line nevertheless deals rather more obliquely with lesbianism, almost as if it dare not speak its name (and it doesn't in the first film version of Hellman's play, These Three). So what makes Chloe of interest is as an example of how far, at least cinematically, we have come from the days when such topics, especially the ""hot button"" one of inter-generation sex, hetero, lesbian or otherwise, were relegated to underground movie houses or private viewings.",Chloe
468736,"Despite David Cronenberg's position as my second-favourite director, even an out-and-out fan like me notices when he starts to repeat himself. One of the problems with auteur directors who write, produce, and direct their movies is that you tend to see a repetition of themes. Now these might be put down to style, but there are lots of ideas here from Videodrome and The Fly, albeit with more up to the minute special effects. The obsession with the body, self-inflicted bodily change and decay is here, with a good measure of William Gibson thrown in. Unless I missed something, the idea of plugging yourself into an organic computer and experiencing virtual reality first came up in the Matrix in 1976's Doctor Who in the story The Deadly Assassin, and the idea of not knowing which reality you are in has been rather worn out by Philip K. Dick. It's not a bad film by any means, and Jude Law turns in a particularly impressive performance. It is however predictable and derivative, and a director with a track record for originality as good as Cronenberg's is capable of so much more.",Existenz VHS

1173649,"As the latest offering from the prolific Judd Apatow stable, this meandering but amusing 2008 comedy probably had one of the most irritating advertising campaigns ever for a wide release movie as cryptic billboards were posted everywhere with nasty diatribes written to the title character. Having enjoyed Apatow'sThe 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Upa lot, I am starting to realize there is a bit more of a potluck feel when Apatow isn't in the director's chair. This time, first-time director Nicholas Stoller is at the helm working from a script written by the film's star, Jason Segel. Granted the comic premise is not as fresh here as in the earlier films, but it is entertaining in a ramshackle sort of way with some moments of surprising nuance. Segel plays Peter Bretter, a typical nice-guy type who writes the music (or more accurately, the sonic tones) of a network TV series that looks very much likeC.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation. The show stars his hot-babe girlfriend Sarah, and they've been together for five years, an eternity at least by Hollywood standards.The film wastes no time in setting up the central problem - Sarah abruptly dumps Peter for Brit rock star Aldous Snow, and through the plot's key contrivance, the three of them end up in the same resort in Hawaii. Naturally, Peter is devastated by the break-up, especially when he has to watch Sarah and Aldous in post-coital euphoria in a tropical honeymoon setting. Peter does find solace in the shapely form and understanding heart of Rachel Jansen, the hotel's front desk manager. All of this is fairly by-the-numbers and reminds me of the tropical shenanigans in the inferior remake ofThe Heartbreak Kid, except Segel as a writer makes all the characters likable to varying degrees. Aldous, as played dexterously by comedian Russell Brand, is a hilarious comic creation, a sexed-up, non-sequitur-spouting cast-off from Spinal Tap. Even Sarah comes across less as a vicious harpy and more as someone who felt she tried to salvage the relationship (although interpersonal communication must not be one of her strong suits).As Peter, Segel has a doughy, affable appeal though not particularly arresting for a main character. When he's not being teary-eyed over Sarah or just plain naked, he has a tendency to throw away lines in a casual manner rather than deliver them. Saddled with the toughest part, Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) acquits herself well enough as Sarah to make her character's fate more of a concern than one would expect. Late ofThat '70s Show, the saucy Mila Kunis provides a down-to-earth sexiness to Rachel. Of course, several members of the Apatow repertory company are present and accounted for - Bill Hader as Peter's sarcastic brother, Jonah Hill as a waiter with a severe man-crush on Aldous (perhaps a tweak to his role inSuperbad), and Paul Rudd as a stoned surfing instructor (Seth Rogen is conspicuously absent). Funny bits are also provided by Jack McBrayer (Kenneth on30 Rock) as a petrified honeymooner and comic Steve Landesberg as a helpful pediatrician. As usual for an Apatow movie, the movie goes on for too long, and the scenes with the competing couples, while funny, play on the predictable side, as does the inevitable ending. It's all funny enough but just not as focused as I wish it could have been.",N/A
1160227,"If you're looking for the next Ringu, you will probably leave this film being disappointed. That's the mindset I came into this film with & I ended up leaving somewhat disappointed, somewhat pleased by this film.The film's premise is so bizarre that you can't help but be curious. The idea of killer hair is one that hasn't been done very often so there's no worries about this film falling into too many cliches. They're here, but when you add the whole ""hair extensions will kill you"" factor into it those cliches become something new. When you add on the true horror aspect of the movie, the abuse of a small child, the film becomes truly cringe worthy.It's just that at the same time, this film wasn't particularly great. At times I got the impression that the director was deliberately trying to make a B movie, which both helped & hurt the film. It also doesn't help that the film just dragged at times & felt longer than it's hour & a half time. The acting in the film is very well done for a film of this nature(the abusive mother giving one of the best performances in the film) & the plot is well done enough, but it just can't save itself from itself.I do recommend watching it, if only for the strangely comedic scene of Yamazaki (the guy selling the hair extensions) dancing around his apartment singing ""Hair, hair"".

879216,"While Gregory Peck heads the cast, ""The Purple Plain"" is a British World War II film, produced in 1954 by the J. Arthur Rank Studios (and presumably distributed by MGM). So far reviews seem to fall into two camps--people who love it and people who are unimpressed with it. I find myself somewhere between these two extremes. Unlike at least one other reviewer, I will try not to reveal too much of the plot for first-time viewers.Mr. Peck plays Squadron Leader Bill Forrester, a Canadian pilot and veteran of the Battle of Britain, now assigned to the Asian theatre of the war, specifically Burma, against the Japanese. Having lost his young wife in the London blitz, Forrester feels he has nothing to live for, and flies his Mosquito missions accordingly. He is reckless, even suicidal, much to the chagrin of his navigator as well as the people on the ground.The kind Dr. Harris (a ""pre-M"" Bernard Lee) tries to help Forrester out of his depression by involving him with some of the local Burmese people, including a lovely young woman, Anna (Win Min Than). Forrester becomes captivated with Anna, and slowly regains his self respect and will to live. His survival instincts are soon put to the test. On the next flight, his plane crashes in very harsh, and Japanese-held, territory. Forrester survives the crash along with his young navigator(Lyndon Brook), who receives nasty burns, and an older scientist, Blore (Maurice Denham). With limited water, and the blazing Burmese sun, the three men face a harsh fate, with a questionable chance of survival. Can Forrester return to the woman who has rekindled his interest in life, and redeem a tattered reputation with his compatriots ?Mr. Peck delivers a compelling performance--he remains one of the most watchable actors in movies. I should also mention that fine British character actress, Brenda De Banzie--her role is small, but she leaves an indelible impression as Miss McNabb, the indefatigable Scottish missionary.The full-screen picture exhibits effective colour--the sound is mono--don't look for extras.""The Purple Plain"" may not be one of Gregory Peck's most famous films--nor can it be considered one of the classic films of the fifties. At the same time, I found it an absorbing drama, well-acted by Mr. Peck, Ms. Than and a fine British cast--there is action, romance, suspense and important, universal themes are explored. I am pleased to add this DVD to my collection.",The Purple Plain 1954

Sam Rockwell has an abrupt, angry energy, but the script of the movie makes him do too many things, or have too many quirky sides and no actor could incorporate them all with any success.  If he had just been a grifter who pretended to choke when he wanted a patron, that might have been cool.  Or if he had had a cute job as a historical re-enactor at a Williamsburg-style theme attraction, living the Judd Apatow lifestyle with gawky, earnest Zack Galifianakis, that would have been enough for me.But on top of it is the whole sex addict thing and also having Anjelica Huston for a mother,  It's like a broad re-write of Portnoy's Complaint, except told from the inside of a mental hospital.

457240,"Image Entertainment 1999 ReleaseThis is a very hard movie to rate, as one has to take into account not only the entertainment value, but it's historic value as well. As an entertainment entity, I believe it fails. Scenes between three different tales keep alternating, and it isn't until the end of the movie that one finally realizes how they all tie together. (Jules Verne's books ""20,000 Leagues..."" and ""Mysterious Island"", are both intertwined into the plot of the movie, along with a storyline created just for the film.) Add to that an inordinate amount of time showing underwater shots which, while I'm sure were wonderful in their day, were eclipsed long ago by the likes of Jacques Cousteau, and you have both a confusing, and rather boring film.That said, if one views this movie from an historic perspective, it can be quite enjoyable. After all, this was made in 1916, and was one of the first films to have such underwater photography. The octopus, as an extremely early special effect, would be quite convincing, if it weren't for the readily apparent fake eyes.As for the DVD, the source used was quite good, considering the age of the film. I can't say how it would look on a large monitor, and I'm guessing that it is probably interlaced. However, on my smaller widescreen TV, it looked quite nice. The musical accompaniment was wonderful. It fit both the era of the film, and was scene appropriate.The transfer may have benefitted from windowboxing (to make up for overscan), as some of the intertitles are pretty tight. However, given this is a 1999 release, I think it looks quite good.If you are interested in cinema history, I would recommend this disc.

Well I skipped this one as the reviews back then were just horrible. They beat up Madonna and Sean Penn pretty badly back then as I recall. And I would recall very well as I was a HUGE Madonna fan back then. But after all of these years I finally watched it. I don't get what was so wrong. I can remember three of them: 1) The way Madonna read the line ""He's gaining"" 2) The fake way Madonna was ""crying"" after she fell out of the window and 3) the way the guy chasing them ran through all the merchants and people on the street for ""action"" when he could have ran down the empty street itself. The ending had a good twist but was a left one thing loose for me . . . where were the flowers all the time? And what were those jewels? That didn't seem to be explained well. Other than this I liked the movie. It was a Adventure's in Babsitting, Ferris Beuller's Day off, type of movie . . . . Nothing special. Nothing horrible. I think people were hell bent on bringing Madonna under control back then  . . . they couldn't let her get too big  . . . not at least with acting as she had already conquered the music world. . . and for good reason as we found out in the 90s (when I stopped being a fan). It probably deserves two stars. But I am going to give it 3 as I feel misled by all the bad press around it. Also the extra features were just OK. There should have been more . . . deeper . . . more secrets revealed after all of this about a movie that bombed so badly and with such big names attached to it. Were was Madonna, Sean, and George's remarks? And Melissa Rivers??? Shows they just rushed to put something together to make it a ""Special Edition"". Why not forgo the VH1 personalities and get the actors. They only had the one. And he was the only one who provided the behind the scenes stuff.",N/A
442762,"Viewed: 10/06Rate: 610/06: Day of the Dead is a much better picture than Dawn of the Dead, but of course as expected, not as the same as Night of the Living Dead. There are some points I liked about Day of the Dead that drew some interesting things. After an hour of Day of the Dead, it started to get better and shaped into a genuine horror picture despite the fact there were some awful lame-brained characters and bad acting. The concept of a mad scientist trying to create civilized behavior out of the living dead is a sure-fire way to create a picture out of Day of the Dead, but the thought of it is reasonably unsound because they are dead already. Of course, I am impressed with the nice touch by making Bub a seemingly human being instead of a brain-dead zombie. I know the intelligence behind the picture is very low, and I had this bright idea, which was already spoken in the picture, which is simply abandon the army idiots and start a family with that woman. It's not a question of morals but an obligation. Then, they can begin a systemic eradication by some sort of a way in doing it quicker. After all, the four were pretty smart to know better. Day of the Dead doesn't really start the movie until the last 30 minutes, which turned out well for better. A lot of great special effects by Tom Savani. I would call Day of the Dead a more true horror film and a better picture than Dawn of the Dead.",N/A

The overloaded plot revolves around an assistant D.A. who gets involved with a defense lawyer to solve a convoluted case that includes arson, art robbery, insurance fraud, even murder.It's almost as if the plot was not the point. The 22-carat charisma of Robert Redford and the starry-eyed charm of Debra Winger is what keeps the film afloat with some delicious chemistry. Daryl Hannah is very effective as the spaced-out daughter, who spends most of the movie seeming sexy and/or guilty.The whole mishmash ends up significantly less than the sum of its parts, which is sad because with only slightly better editing it stood on the brink of being an excellent film.

574052,"It's all to easy to understand why Lamberto Bava's solo directorial debut Macabre failed to find much of an audience back in 1980: it feels more like a pitch than a fully fleshed out story, and one that's overly reliant on a shock ending that's pretty obvious. At times it feels like two separate underdeveloped films almost in competition with each other. Unfortunately the most interesting, a bad seed plot with the anti-heroine's homicidal daughter taking revenge on her for her infidelity by killing her young brother and trying to drive mommy back into the asylum, gets the least screen time in favor of mom not letting a little thing like decapitation stand between her and her dead lover. Much of it feels padded out and repetitive and unfortunately leading lady Bernice Stegers, admittedly hampered by a presumably dubbed deep fried Sowthan aksunt, simply cannot carry the film. Too well made to be unintentionally funny (at least until the absurd final shot), too boring to hold the attention and too predictable to offer any suspense, it's not difficult to see why this was such a flop that Bava didn't direct another film for three years.Lamberto Bava's second film, A Blade in the Dark, is a slightly above average late giallo despite some incredibly some heavy-handed clues (a female director who dresses in men's suits, an actress appearing in a play about Vita Sackville-West, a flamboyantly gay assistant and an opening scene where two children taunt another for being a female - gee, do you think they're trying to tell us something about the killer?). Somewhat surprisingly originally intended for television but turned down for excessive violence, it mostly makes a virtue of its low budget though isn't able to make much of its key location, a large but rather characterless and unmenacing villa that conveniently belonged to the film's producer. Still, any film that has a director being killed by her own film has something going for it.",N/A

I cannot verify how many minutes are missing, since my VHS copy is gone, but this is not the complete movie I first saw at the theater in 1964.I give this DVD three stars for the quality of the picture (which is somewhat dark), the cropping and the missing scene.

1161187,"I watched my first Jean-Pierre Melville film, Le Samourai, a few months ago.  His style excited me so I decided I needed to watch everything he'd done.  Un flic was my second choice mainly because of Alain Delon.It opens with the most beautiful bank robbery I've ever seen on film.  Melville orchestrates such an elegant gloom; his use of the elements and natural light is remarkable. I was mesmorized immediately and stayed that way throughout most of the movie.Then came the train heist.I watched with a friend, and our post-discussion centered directly on how poorly this fairly large chunk of the film was executed. ""The train reminded me of the special effects I used to enjoy on Mister Roger's Neighborhood,"" said my companion.  I could only wince and nod.  The train was obviously fake, but worse than that was the tiny helicopter hovering overhead.  It had the sort of prop strings a VCR would pick up.(We fabricated a theory about the difficulty of filming this at night because a real helicopter is shown landing in the daylight the following morning.  Perhaps this was the problem?)I hate to pick this movie apart, and I don't mean to deter someone from watching it, but in my opinion this was awkward enough to interrupt the flow of a gorgeous film, hence my three-star rating.  Please keep in mind, Dirty Money was filmed in 1972, not 1952.  I found the bump unforgivable.If you're not bothered with this, by all means, buy the movie.  The acting is wonderfully calculated and stoic; a glorious Melville constant, from what I hear.  Fantastic cars everywhere.  Softly resonating street lights pulsing along the Paris cityscape....and nobody slaps like Alain Delon.There are still some treasures here.- t -9 July, 2010",Dirty Money

We will presume him to be innocent, but the cab driver is certain he is innocent and only wants to help his brother. He doesn't hate America in spite of what has happened.A woman gets into his cab, clearly upset about her own personal issues. She asks to be driven downtown and has the cab driver park outside a house where she cries when she sees a man, woman, and child arriving home. She keys the car, and then shows the cab driver a picture of the man, woman, and child, with herself. She says she is a producer of Reality TV Shows, like ""Sorry, Haters,"" a show that displays the lavish lifestyles of rappers to induce envy in viewers. Her husband is an artist, and the woman is their nanny; but she and her husband are estranged, and he is now with the nanny.The cab driver is anxious to get home, as he needs to bring some money to his brother's wife. She is not ready to go home. He will drive her around, but needs to make a quick stop. As he is talking to his brother's wife, she barges in and intrudes on their life. On hearing about his brother's plight, she offers to try to get him a lawyer, but instead she steals the money he has saved to help him. His situation goes from bad to worse. He goes back to her office to find out why she pretended to want to help him, but then went about trying to destroy him.The film doesn't really answer this riddle, but we do learn that Phoebe was not really who she said she was.

1253586,".......................................................................(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS  SPOILERS)..........................To make a long story short, I was there for Toy Story 1 and 2, played the video games, had some Toy Story folders, and other merchandise growing up. So you can bet I was excited to see they were coming out with a 3rd Toy Story movie. Went to see it a couple of days ago...and maybe it's because I was a bit tired (Thanks to some people who parked in front of my house at 5:00 AM and woke me up when they started talking and bouncing a basketball while I had my bedroom windows open)that I didn't take to this movie.First things first, I didn't like the beginning. It seemed very rushed and forced upon you. The toys all started freaking out that they were going to get donated,and that's all we heard. Even if there was little proof of it happening. Then Andy opens the attic door and it closes when he walks away. Andy set the bag with the toys RIGHT UNDER THE PULL DOWN ATTIC DOOR and his mom just assumes it's garbage and puts it on the curb?!?! Okay, she didn't take notice of where the bag was at?!?! I mean, maybe Andy didn't get the time yet to open up the attic door and put his toys away!!??!Also, a LOT of cool toys from the original two movies are gone,which is to be expected.  kids do get rid of stuff overtime and a lot of parents love putting things out for yard sales, but the problem is no one is there in their place. Sure they tried to put other toys in this movie from the day care or from Bonnie's house, but MOST of those toys, beside the hedgehog, Ken, and Hugs-A-Lot Bear have little or no on screen time for you to get a feel for them as a character, learn their personality, or become attached to them. They are just bland faces. I'd rather have Wheezy, Etch-A-Skeetch, the little blue robot, RC Car, the small plastic snake, and LASTLY BO PEEP....Getting rid of Bo Peep was dumb. She was a pretty big secondary character right next to Ham, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head. Also, Hugs a Lot is a complete Jerk...in every sense of the word. He doesn't even bring across that ""love to hate them"" type feeling, like ""Darth Vader"" or other really cool bad guys. He's just extremely mean and down-right nasty, especially considering what he did at the end of this film. I hated having him in this movie!Which brings me to next point, without interesting characters, the clever banter and humor between toys was missing in this one. No funny one liners or jokes that adults would only get. Just BLAH. Oh sure, the story had a plot and it unfolded decently, and the characters said enough, but I was looking for it to be fun along the way as well.Another thing is, the childhood innocence Andy had while playing with his toys in the first two movies is missing. Instead, Andy is grown up and we have his replacement Bonnie, whom I just didn't like. She seemed goofy...and I hate to say that about a child character, but I just didn't care for her at all. When she was playing with the toys it made me feel weird, awkard, and uncomfortable.Which brings me to my last reason for not really liking this movie, the ending. I wanted Andy to go put his toys in the attic, and then the toys live on together and are happy. One day down the road, Andy would be going through the Attic, come upon his old toys, pull them out, and fall in love all over again. He might have even tracked down another Etch a Sketch, Bo Peep doll, or RC car that he keeps at his own house for his kids or because he regretted giving them away.  BUT...I didn't get that sense of closure. So give me something else worthwhile!Pixar and Disney said, ""NO!"" So what happens is Andy is going to put his toys in the Attic, but Woody puts a post it note on the box to please donate the toys. So Andy takes them Bonnie's house and they play with the toys together. Now I think this part of the movie was really botched...We could have seen Andy playing with his toys again FOR OLD TIMES SAKE, possibly in slow motion and accompanied to some slow and mellow music. Maybe we could have seen some flashbacks to when he played with them before, when he was younger. You know something to really makes us feel sad about the loss of childhood innocence that has taken place? But instead, Andy plays with the toys as if he doesn't really care, no real emotion what so ever. Like it's no big deal.Then he goes back to his car, and gets in. He's looking at his toys for a long time with a VERY sad look in his face because he's leaving behind toys he still wants. I kept saying to myself,"" Go back for them then if you are going to miss them!!!"" But Andy just drives off, the toys stand on Bonnie's front porch, and the camera pans upward toward the sky...THAT'S MY SENSE OF CLOSURE?!?Then random clips of the toys enjoying their new life comes out and we some of the humor that was so lacking in the film. In my opinion, this movie's ending was horrible. What Pixar should have done is added all the credit scenes of the toys enjoying their new life to the end of the film, and made that the end. You know, a sense of closure that the toys were going to be all right. Maybe have ""You've got a friend in me"" playing to the montage to let us know things are back the way they used to be and the toys are enjoying themselves again.But instead, this movie's end feels like a set up for a new movie...I sense Toy Story is going to head the way of A LOT of Disney movies and go down the path of not as appealing, quick cash in, Direct to Video sequels. Toy Story 3 was ALMOST a direct to video movie...So I wouldn't be surprised at all if this happened! So forget about me getting that sense of closure I was talking about earlier, instead I got a way for Disny and Pixar to dig the franchise up and bring it back to life whenever they want to! Life Lesson 101: Sometimes it's good when something good ends before it has the chance of going on for too long and becoming stale.I did however, like the idea of Mrs. Potato Head using her missing eye to see Andy, and how Mr. Potato head transferred himself to a wrap for a taco...but did anyone else think he looked like the Mr. Potato head parody character on Mad Tv's old spoof of Toy Story? Coincidence?Also, I did like the part near the end where the toys were going to get melted. They did that well,and it really had me worried and brought out some emotion in me. Thus, making me care. Thus, making me like that scene.Overall, I liked this movie. But it can't hold a candle to the first toy released years ago. However, I'd still recommend seeing it at least once, or buying a copy when it released.",Toy Story 3

400090,"I was underwhelmed by every aspect of this animated feature.  The plot held very little intrigue (when it could be understood).  Cybernetic cops are after an unseen villain called The Puppet Master.  Several dubious agencies on the fringe are also involved.  But not much in the way of suspense is maintained.  Everything is handled on an apathetic level.  All the characters are uniformly flat (in more ways than one).  One character does more than just bare her soul (Major Motoko Kusanagi), at the most bizarre moments she suddenly strips naked and carries on with her duties that apparently just involve a lot of shooting, running, and dodging bullets, when she's not standing stock still and carrying on internal conversations.  Half of this film is stationary.  Just when you think you're dealing with a glitch in your DVD player, something moves.  For an animated film, very little of it is actually animated/active.  The backgrounds are fixed, there's little action to be had until a scene shifts to a shootout.  It's all rather blas&eacute;.  To make matters worse, there are two extended, as in very long, musical interludes (one's a song, the other's just noise passing for music; both are arbitrary to the plot).

Cleverly scripted, flawlessly acted,  wittily directed, and hauntingly scored, it's a marvel of a movie on many  levels; it works as a horror film, a satire, a black comedy, a social  commentary -- even as a romantic melodrama -- depending on your individual  interpretation.It's a real pity, then, that this rich cinematic  treasure has received such a disappointing transfer to the DVD format.  After experiencing the sharply focused, pristine prints presented on  Universal's DVD releases of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and  &quot;The  Mummy&quot;, my expectations for &quot;Bride&quot; were  enthusiastically  high.  What a letdown!  The film is grainy, with distractingly poor  contrast -- the actors appear to have microcrobes running across their  faces, like amoeba that you might observe under a microscope.

373499,"Richie Rich is a thoroughly ridiculous movie - ridiculous situations, ridiculous characters, ridiculously large (but very real Biltmore Estate) mansion, and its ridiculously fun too.  Like Spiderman, Superman, Batman, and others, the character of Richie Rich is based on a comic book superhero.  Richie Rich offers us a different type of superhero in that his super power consists of the ridiculous amount of $$$$$ he has.  Richie and his family can do amazing things with their superpower. They can build their own Mount Richmore, build a McDonald's in their basement, have their own rollercoaster, jet all over the world and more. Just as most kids have dreamed of being able to fly like Superman and swing from webs like Spidey, kids and adults alike have dreamt of what it would be like to have Bill Gates' billions.  And like Superman, Batman, Spidey, etc., the Rich family uses their superpower to help others.Another similarity between Richie and other comic book heroes is that just as Superman, Spidey and Batman's superpowers keep them from getting and/or keeping a girl - Richie's superpower keeps him from getting and keeping friends.

Though Richie's $$$$$ plays an initial role in introducing him to potential friends, it's not what enables him to keep them - Richie is genuinely a nice kid.Sure its silly and ridiculous but guess what - its supposed to be.

1534900,"the last Sade DVD Sade - Lovers Live got KILLED by this director's hyperactive interventions. It was like going to worship in awe a goddess at the cathedral, but going with Peewee Herman hyperactivated on candy and coffee, with a red bull kicker. I went to watch Sade quietly, watching, and saw VERY little of her, cut away at the most important second to see the back up band doing NOTHING but standing where they were the last time we cut away to them. I went to watch Sade and saw only the briefest of glimpses from a roaming roller coastering unsteadicam. The last one of Sade this director cranked out of her meatgrinder is cinematography by the earlest, most anarchic Marx Brothers flying around the stage causing mayhem in the midst of due solemnity.For Sade is all about restraint, elegance, dignity, understatement, grace, beauty, and requires, and rewards, a stationary camera on her alone filled with her beauty and understated grace, not this pyrotechnic display of the latest technology which leaves one filling like an unwilling participant in the Sun Dance of the Sioux, hung by hooks spinning from the top of the teepee, like an over aged Peter Pan unable to liberate oneself fomr the constant gyrations of the harness swung high above the stage, unable to see, ready for nausea, for motion sickness.I come to watch Sade, not to get car sick.Why should I trust this director again?Like Sade asks in the Lovers Rock cd, Somebody Already Broke My Heart, I've been hurt before, can't go there again.and this set, which includes the Soldier of Love material, skips the BEST cut from that cd, Long Hard Road, and a lot of the great stuff from Lovers Rock as well, The Sweetest Gift, for instance.And where is that most important tune for our times, Feel No Pain.

We should never notice the camera as it focusses on the subject of greatest interest flowingly, peacefully, still. When we see the camera motion it is wrong, and here all we see is the camera motion, swinging us around like a stone on a string.When you notice the cut, the editing is wrong; and we wince each time the cut so quickly grabs us from the star's face to something completely different that we did not pay to see, that we do not want to see, that we are forced to see, swung around at great speed.

At the risk of sounding like a one of those stuffy, traditionalist Cambridge university lecturers it really  does spoil it for me when films based on historical events take ridiculous  liberties and forsake historical facts, which are more often than not  interesting in themselves to maintain interest, and replace them with  sensationalist and fictitious stuff. And  this film could be perceived as one of those annoying films.  But it is only annoying if it is meant to be  taken as a serious portrayal of the tragic and fascinating life of Anne  Boleyn, Great Henry's second wife and mother of the remarkable Elizabeth I,  and this film, judging by all accounts, is most certainly not.  The factual  content is a good enough excuse to get dressed up and go over the  top and the main leads Genevieve Bujold and Richard Burton give it their all as the fiesty two-some; the chemistry is striking and you can't help admiring the costume department for all those lavish items of clothing.Pap, but enjoyable pap and therefore redeemed.",N/A

427333,"Directed by Ridley Scott's brother, Tony Scott, this 1980s horror vampire film is not a typical vampire movie and yet at the same time is not even a typical motion picture. There is no mistaking though that The Hunger does look great and the lighting camera combination is very gothic urban.The story strands involve two vampires played by David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve, who kill people to drink their blood so they can have extended life. However these vampires are not the traditional type. They do not have fangs and they can go out in sunlight. Susan Sarandon plays a scientist who thinks that aging is a disease and can be cured. She is sought after by Catherine Deneuve.The film is notorious for the lesbian scene between Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. There are also impressive special effects for Bowie's aging process. He grows old over the course of a number of scenes. Apart from this however the film seems to loose touch with the subject matter, freely roaming towards art for art's sake and sacrifices the story so severely that the ending doesn't make any sense because of it.If you are a fan of Tony Scott, David Bowie, Catherine Deneuve or 80s horror films then it might be worth checking out.

Like Clinton (*cough*) he didn't inhale, although he took several drags on the cigarette. My question for that scene is: why bother having the kid smoke if he's not going to inhale? Obviously Zeger doesn't smoke, and for that I applaud him, as so many actors and actresses in Hollywood do.Regarding the silly occurrences. Say you're a father with a child that has a terrible fear of the dark. Would you:a) Put a number of floodlights where they could be easily reached, say a chest in an open area, orb) Put them in a dark attic?Of course the movie chose ""b"".Regardless, I was immensely surprised when I found myself trapped in suspense.

991104,"Looking back through the corridors of cinema through the passages of time, one could almost say that films released in the early days were more creative, more intuitive, and more aggressive than those raiding our multiplexes today.  Films made in the 1940 especially stand out as those that seem to delve into the human psyche more than the capers of ""Transformers"" or ""Bee Movie"" in today's standard.  There are elements that continue to excite and bewilder this critic for films made in the 1940s compared to those today.  ""His Girl Friday"", ""Blithe Spirit"", and even ""Brief Encounter"" can easily be placed into my DVD player well before anything made during the current year ... why is that?  For me it is creativity and example, modern day Hollywood seems to be in a recycling slump with only a handful of ""must-see"" films being released every year.  It feels as if the creative has died and been replaced with the commercial.  If product placement isn't in every contract, a film will die before it is born.  Recently, I had the opportunity to see another innovative chapter in the 1948 film release vault entitled ""The Amazing Mr. X"", while released pathetically by a under budget DVD company, the film itself carries with it a strong blend of creativity, suspense, and intrigue followed up by an ending that will shock the very cockles of your heart.  While it wasn't a glowing example of perfection, it did demonstrate an early, more innovative side of Hollywood that wasn't afraid of exploring the unknown.With a strong cast and a devilish plot, ""The Amazing Mr. X"" begins strong, looses steam near the middle, but oddly regains its footing by the final act.  There are honest moments of suspense and giddiness as you see how Turhan Bey uses his ""magic"" to educate those who are - let' say - weak of mind, but full of possibilities.  Mr. Bey is fantastic in the lead role, giving up nothing of his character, going outside of his pre-designated box to portray this mesmerizing con-artist.  Coupled with his raven, he is menacing, sinister, and provocative all at once.  He is the core of this film, and director Bernard Vorhaus did a great job of casting him and giving him the space to create the character.  Bey's eyes let us see into his world, and they never let us go.  Lynn Beri works well against Bey's performance, but at times it seems shallow and shuttered.  This deepens whenever her pseudo-boyfriend, Richard Carlson, happens to be around.  He is another character that seemed to be created simply as a plot devise, and added nothing to the overall scheme of the film.  As you watch these characters work together, it is obvious that Bey is the only one enjoying what he is doing, going beyond the script and giving us a strong performance.  The rest seemed like cardboard, reading their lines with little to no development as the film progresses.  I couldn't shake Bey's performance, or his home for that matter.  Did anyone else see the technology that he used - well beyond the 1940s, but added a whole new level of evil to his character.  ""The Amazing Mr. X"" was not a character driven film, but instead a plot driven caper with many levels.  It worked because of Mr. Bey, but alas, the other characters could have been revamped.  Even if you ignore the characters, the style of this film really sets it apart from current cinema.John Alton took this film over the top.  His use of the camera was striking in this early film.  There are scenes that just stand out as staples of other horror/mystery films of today.  The scene that grabs me is when Bey conjures the spirits in his house.  The special effects used (of the music, the piano, the face, and so forth) were genuinely spooky.  There were two distinct elements to this film; one was the darkened room of Bey in which he was able to show people what they wanted to see, and the lighted truth of Beri's huge mansion.  It was when the two began to blend together that the tension spiked in the film.  Decent characters, amazing cinematography, good script - so where did this film go wrong?  Like others of this era, there was so much excitement going into the film that elements seemed to be left out.  Director Vorhaus (of who should be praised for this film) seemed to enjoy the long motionless, emotionless, and corny long shots of our characters doing absolutely nothing.  This occurred more through the center of the film where interest was fading due to a lack of mobility.  ""The Amazing Mr. X"" had such a strong opening, the beach scene was startling, that when we moved to the center, dialogue driven part, there was nothing for the audience to grab onto.  We had the early character development; this middle part just seemed forced.  Then, we were dished a huge surprise (honestly, one that I didn't see coming) that revitalized the film and gave us a twisting ending.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, but the journey to that part was too costly.Bey's sidekick was forgotten.  Beri's sister became annoying. These are just a few small steps that could have been tightened to ensure that this film wouldn't fall through the cracks and perhaps catapult itself into ""cult"" status.  This was an early independent feature, and while budgeting is always needed, this film could have strengthened a couple of scenes so that the audience wouldn't loose its grip midstream.  Overall, I liked this film, but it isn't one that I could watch on a repetitive basis.  I thought the creativity was outstanding, this is one of those films that shocked me once, twice, even three times and I wasn't even ready for it.  The direction could have been tighter, but at times I forgot about it due to the strong camera work by Alton.  ""The Amazing Mr. X"" is a film made well before its time, and if released again today, I think there are some that would attach themselves to it because of what it has to offer.  This is not a film for everyone, but for those willing to explore possibilities and undiscovered avenues.  This film had a strong main character coupled with some innovative special effects for the time.  On a side note, I could watch a whole movie about the magician cop - it was a breathe of fresh air during this dark caper.  Watch it once for the experience, I think it was worth the rental.Grade: ***  out of *****",N/A

Face it: There's Something About Mary is not Airplane! nor Hot Shots! nor any of those other well-remembered  classics.What we don't see here is the tradition of the running joke.  Z-A-Z films are famous for their repeated gags, some of them owing their  existence to earlier films (such as the brilliant &quot;screwdriver&quot;  scene in Airplane 2: The Sequel when Ted still has his &quot;drinking  problem&quot;).Standing on its own, the movie does have funny points  (some riotously funny) but they tie together badly. The screenplay seems to  have been written in order to jump from one joke to the next, but with no  thought given to fleshing out each joke to give it depth and character like  a running gag can develop. Many jokes are just funny because of their shock  value, an attribute which wears off quickly in any film. Great comedies  carry jokes on multiple levels, some of them mere statements of irony  spanning large parts of the film, yet Mary doesn't have that.Yeah, the  movie was funny, but it just wasn't as funny as it was hyped up to be.

300580,"Danish film maker Carl Dryer (1889-1968) is considered among Europe's finest directors, the creator of innovative 1928 THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC and the legendary VAMPYR--but some cinematic legends are best left recalled instead of revisited, and such is the case with the latter film.  Produced in 1930, released in 1932, and very loosely based on the novella CARMILLA by Sheridan LeFanu, VAMPYR does indeed have moments of great poety, but on the whole the film is akin to watching paint dry.The plot of VAMPYR is trivial, the tale of a young man who stumbles into a mysterious estate where one of two sisters is under vampiric attack.  The appeal of the film is actually in Dyer's truly remarkable cinematic ideas, ideas that are often described as surrealistic in execution.  Shadows move independently of those who cast them--or exist without any source at all.  Fog and mist drift strangely through the landscapes.  A skull moves of its own accord.  And most spectacularly, the young man experiences an out-of-body vision in which he foresees that he himself will fall prey to the vampire unless he can destroy it.These moments are memorable indeed and there is no doubt the film is visually stunning.  Unfortunately, it is also very, very, very slow.  In theory, this slowness exists to intensify the poetry of the images and a crawling sense of horror; in actual fact, however, I found it simply slow, and that the extremely languid pace undercut both poetry and horror to a very significant degree.  Fans of the film--and it has many--will no doubt curse me as a Philistine and declare VAMPYR is too fine to be appreciated by the likes of me.As in most instances, the Criterion Collection edition offers a group of interesting bonuses.  It is worth noting, however, that the film itself is not in pristine condition (it never has been); even so, this is easily the best print in circulation.  Recommended for hardcore cinephiles, but most others should give it a miss.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",N/A

180803,"I think the best way to describe ""Playing God,"" the film that David Duchovny did during his summer off from ""The X-Files"" in 1977, is that the actor tried playing the self-destructive character who is the protagonist of the film and then reached a point where he decided it was better to have fun with the role.  What follows could not be considered to be too little, but it really does come too late for director Andy Wilson's film to really work.The premise is certainly interesting enough.  Dr. Eugene Sands (David Duchovny) is a defrocked doctor who lost his license to practice medicine when he tried performing surgery drugged out of his mind and killed a patient.  Down in the depths of despair Sands is out trying to score some heroin in a bar where bad things happen when something bad happens and one of the customers is blown away.  Sands offers the sage medical advice that 911 should be called, but it seems that would actually be a bad thing so he ends up doing a MacGuyver-style version of meatball surgery to save the guy.Two interesting things happen as a result of this incident.  The first is that Sands remembers that being a doctor was an even bigger rush than what he got from drugs.  The second is that Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton), who has lots of ill-gotten gain, arranges a meeting with Sands and gives him $10,000.  This is a way for Blossom to say thanks for saving his friend but it is also an invitation for Sands to be a doctor again.  He will not have a license, but he will get to practice medicine and on some rather interesting patients while some even more interesting interested parties look on.Complicating the offer is Gage (Michael Massee), an F.B.I. agent who knows about the deal that Blossom is giving Sands and wants to use that information to force little fish Sands to give him big fish Blossom.  Then there is Claire (Angelina Jolie), Blossom's mistress, who pouts at Sands in a provocative way.  But since Blossom is the sort of person who pays Sands to bring back someone from the dead just so they can be killed, trying to take Claire away from him is not going to be a good idea.  Of course, Sands will try.The best and worst scenes in this movie are a pair of surgery scenes that show that Duchovny's instincts on how to play the part are at odds with the initial drama.  The worst is when we flashback to see the botched surgery that cost Sands his license.  Show me just this clip and I would pass on seeing the movie.  The best is when Sands has to do another impromptu surgery, this time in a biker bar.  The setting, the characters, and the performances really work, but they run against the grain of the entire set up of the film.  But it represents the part of the film where Duchovny finally finds a way of making the character work.  The only thing wrong with this is that the wisecracking Sands does not really flow from the situation.Actually I rounded down on this one because I thought Timothy Hutton's over the top villain was too over the top.  I liked his coldly calculating moments a lot better than his ranting and raving madman moments, but it is the latter that comes to dominate the end of the film.  The climax tries to speak at some sort of friendship between the two that makes what has come to pass somewhat ironic, but no such relationship was really established here.Ultimately, Duchovny gets more of this film than the audience, because ""Playing God"" clearly teaches him where his strengths as an actor lie in making movies.  He has such an easy-going charm and wry sense of humor that you hope for his wife's sake he is not really acting.  In his follow up theatrical efforts, ""Return to Me,"" ""Evolution"" and ""Connie and Carla"" he clearly plays to his strong suits.  Unfortunately the limited release yesterday of ""House of D,"" written and directed by Duchovny, did not open here in the Zenith City.  I was really looking forward to seeing that flm as his next big move in his career.",N/A

1091090,"I bought this MGM holiday package last year and just got around to watching it.  I already had The Bishop's Wife (colorized) that I had taped on VHS and I had Pocketful of Miracles that I bought as VHS and wanted to replace these two on DVD.  I watched The Bishop's Wife on Christmas Day and although it was not colorized it still remains a holiday favorite. It depicts an American culture of a much gentler time, plus, American actresses in the 30s and 40s were much more highly accomplished than their counterparts of today and are a joy to watch.I had read a few negative reviews of Pocketful of Miracles and couldn't understand why.  I thought the movie was wonderful until I started watching it in the MGM version this morning.  I still have a full screen TV and first of all the wide screen aspect was too severe.  Then there was something wrong with the color.  I fiddled around with my color correction for a while but then finally gave up.  If I were watching this for the first time I think I would have given it a poor review as well.  This version has a harshness that is absent in the VHS version.  I guess I won't donate the VHS to the library but will keep it for as long as my doddering old VCR comtinues to play.",MGM Holiday Classics Collection: (The Bishop's Wife / March of the Wooden Soldiers / Pocketful of Miracles)
1180033,"They say brevity is the soul of wit. Unfortunately this is one of those films that reminds us of that. It also sharpens our appreciation for just how much of the TV show's appeal came from its deft, rapier-like precision. From really tightly written dialogue and spot-on editing.Of course, whenever a half-hour show gets extrapolated into a full length movie, the central issue the creators must struggle with is almost always the same: what works very well in half an hour minus commercial breaks rarely works out so well in a full length movie. The writers must choose between sticking with the tried and tested formula, and so almost inevitably producing mediocrity, or alternatively, taking some very real creative risks with the way they approach and structure the entire piece.In this case...Let's just say they chose not to take those risks.When watching this movie there were times where I really felt as if I were watching a scene from the TV series played out in slow motion. In a typical episode the TV show communicated more in one minute than the film would in ten. There were other times when the film simply dragged, even to the point where it was just plain boring. To be fair, it wasn't all like this. There were times in the film, mainly around the middle, where I genuinely got caught up in the characters, the world they inhabited, and what they were doing. It's just that there were also plenty of times when I didn't. Given that this film came in at over two and a quarter hours, I can't help but feel that it would've benefited from some more proactive editing. It's almost as if, having lived so long under the tyranny of the 22 minute half hour, the writers and editors never developed the ability to impose discipline from within.On the plus side, this film is beautiful simply to look at. And it's impossible for me to say a single bad word about the actors. Or for that matter about the ""behind the scenes"" people who did the props, the sets, and the photography. Everything is immaculately put together. To be perfectly clear, this is not a bad movie. If you look at it simply as something to kill an afternoon while you knock back a few beers (or dare I say, cosmopolitans) then by all means go for it. You're in for an entertaining afternoon. Perhaps the mistake I made was omitting the alcohol. Just be aware that if you go in hoping for something with the wit and depth of the TV series, you are going to be disappointed.Oh, and I personally found the ending a little trite.Not that I'm giving away any spoilers!Theo.",N/A
960543,"After seeing North Country in the bargain bins at nearly every video store, I took the $4 plunge. I caught part of the 2005 film on television, and hey, Sean Bean is in it, so why not?After leaving her abusive husband, Josey (Charlize Theron, Monster) takes a job at the Pearson Mines to support her two children, Sammy (Thomas Curtis) and Karen (Elle Peterson). Her father Hank (Richard Jenkins), also a miner, disapproves of Josey's job, as do most of the male miners. Union representative Glory (Frances McDormand, Fargo) tries to keeps the hazing of the new female minors to a minimum. Unfortunately, Glory can't keep her tough exterior while her health is failing. Her husband Kyle (Sean Bean)-previously injured at the mine-must care for Glory. Josey's Mom Alice (Sissy Spacek) offers support where she can, but after one too many incidents at the mine, Josey turns to ex hockey star turned lawyer Bill (Woody Harrelson) and takes the first class action sexual harassment lawsuit to court.Clearly meant as a vehicle for Charlize Theron, the Oscar winner gives a fine performance here along with other such female Oscar heavy weights as Spacek and McDormand. The faults with North Country are not with the cast. In their brief scenes, Woody Harrelson and Sean Bean support the ladies very well, but it is as if they don't have enough to do. The leading women also don't seem to be as moving as they could be. The talent was definitely there for North Country, but director Niki Caro and writer Michael Seitzman seem to have missed the emotional mark.Based upon the book by Clara Bingham, this true story about women fighting back against sexual harassment should be more moving then it turned out onscreen. After years of courtroom reruns on television, the legal scenes in North Country seem stilted and on the cheap. Woody Harrelson is capable of the courtroom charisma needed, as seen in The People vs Larry Flint, but it seems as if the history making legal precedence is set aside for chick flick moments.The North Country DVD does have a brief deleted scene reel, and for once, these pieces should have been left in the film. Several key conversations between each main cast member were left on the cutting room floor. Some have dialogue, and some are just lengthy moments between the leads, but these scenes add some of the depth needed. At exactly two hours, North Country seems a bit short nowadays. All the pieces to the puzzle are there, but North Country doesn't quite deliver.Men probably won't like this attempted gun-ho women's picture, but younger folks may not either, largely due to the eighties look of the film. North Country's setting is cold Minnesota, 1989-and the hair, costumes, and production look it. I must, however, say the ice hockey presented actually looks authentic-not an easy thing to find! Unfortunately, the DVD contains only the deleted scenes, the standard subtitles, and a brief behind the scenes with the real women of the class action lawsuit.Instead of directing audiences to `stand up' for themselves and other against abuse by going to a website, here was another missed chance to get seriously exhaustive about the issue of filming what is still a touchy subject. How did Theron prepare? Was it rewarding or difficult for the real victims to see their tale onscreen? What does the real mining company have to say about all this? Sadly we just don't know.Although North Country didn't quite hit the nail on the head, the film is just right for a certain audience niche. Women and victims of abuse will find the film worthy, and students learning about such lawsuits might help themselves with a viewing. No one here has a glamorous role, but fans of the cast will no doubt tune in as well. North Country brought to light a very important subject, but the next step was there for the taking.",N/A

1346124,"If you are a fan of the Howling series, you probably already own these movies. For those who have not seen the many lesser sequels to Dante's excellent 1981 original, all I can say is, watch with caution. None of the films offered here are masterpieces (I would argue that Part V is as close as you're going to get to perfection in the series and even this sequel is far from perfect) and all suffer greatly from the typical elements that plague these types of productions, stiff acting, low budget, inferior effects work and sadly for a werewolf movie, really cheesy transformation scenes. The team for ""Howling V - The Rebirth"" were smart and decided not to visualize what they obviously didn't have the budget to produce.Interestingly enough, this set excludes the fourth film in the series, ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"", and goes from number III to V and VI. In my opinion, these 3 are the better sequels so it's only for the better. For those that would like to watch the awful chapter IV, can purchase it individually. It is recommended since movies this bad are sometimes very entertaining but be warned, it stinks. Now, moving on to the movies included on this DVD.The Howling III: The Marsupials  **The second sequel in the series is a wild, sometimes amusing and totally obnoxious film that never takes itself seriously. The main character is the beautiful Jerboa, a marsupial werewolf (who appear to have evolved from the Thylacine) who flees her village and goes to the city where she is cast in a low-budget creature feature. Meanwhile an Australian anthropologist, who has archival film footage from the turn of the century depicting Australian Aborigines sacrificing and killing a werewolf, is convinced the world is being plagued by these hairy monsters. The plot is rather convoluted and although the sequel is amusing at times, it is not always successful as it suffers tremendously from its low budget and childish story. It tries to be creative during its many transformation scenes but they never quite turn out and the werewolves themselves looks rather silly and nowhere near as ferocious as those depicted in Dante's classic. Also, the film is too tongue and cheek so it is not scary in the least. There is no atmosphere, no sense of dread or fear. The original film used horror and humor splendidly while ""Howling III"" over-does it and is more of a parody than an actual horror movie. If you view this as campy entertainment, you may be entertained by it. Definitely do not view this expecting a horror film. If it's horror and shocks you want, you're better off watching a rerun of ""Roseanne"". It is definitely superior to the atrocious first sequel ""Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf"" and the sequel that followed ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"" but overall a very disappointing picture.The Howling V - The Rebirth  ***This fifth entry is hands down the best sequel in the series. If you have seen parts II, III and the poorly done IV, do not expect to find that level of awfulness here as the makers of this film actually delivered in making a good, solid who-dun-it with a werewolf twist.The film starts in medieval times as a mass murder/suicide is taking place. As the victims lay dying on the floor of their castle, a baby is heard crying in the background. Fast forward 500 years later and several individuals, ranging from a doctor, tennis player, a struggling actress, a successful actress, a photographer etc, are summoned to attend the re-opening of a glorious castle in Budapest. At first, it is all fun and interesting conversations but it soon turns threatening when some of the guests begin disappearing and those remaining begin to suspect that something sinister is at play. When some of the victims are found with their throats ripped out, the mysterious Count, who summoned them, reveals the true motive for their gathering. They are all descendants from a werewolf bloodline and they all bear the mark of the beast - a birthmark on their arm, and one of them is indeed a werewolf. They were attempting to single out the beast and to kill it before it kills all and to stop the werewolf bloodline.This nifty little shocker is devoid of intense gore and any werewolf transformation scenes but it is without a doubt, the best in the series besides the original. It is obviously a low budget production but the film team didn't have this hinder their imagination and went around their many obstacles and gave us much needed suspense, something terribly lacking in all of the sequels, a very chilling atmosphere, a good, creepy score, and they manage to squeeze some good performances from most of the cast. For the reviewers who criticize this entry for having bad performances must have not seen the previous (""Howling II"" and ""IV"") and later installments (""Howling 7"" is awful on every level). Most of the actors in this sequel are great in comparison and since there is much more character development here, we end up actually caring for some of these unfortunate souls. Many cite the lack of werewolves in the movie as its main problem. I personally do not think this is an issue at all. I would prefer seeing glimpses of the monster, it's claws, it's angry snarl, it's wicked eyes and in one scene, its hairy silhouette complete with elongated fingernails, than an atrocious B-movie monster in all of its low budget, laughable glory. What we do see of the creature, is good and at least ""The Rebirth"" cannot be criticized for displaying for prolonged periods of screen time an awful looking, rubber creature.""Howling V: The Rebirth"" is not as good or as frightening as the original but in comparison to the other sequels, this one shines above them all as a solid piece that is generally well made with some great location shots, atmosphere, suspense and a rather peculiar, surprise ending. It is not perfect since the pacing is a bit slow and when scrutinized, plot holes are evident but these minor issues are easy to overlook when the rest of the sequels are so darn awful. This fifth entry holds up well and it deserves, at least, a view.Howling VI: The Freaks  **After a good, solid entry with ""The Rebirth"", the franchise took another nose-dive with ""The Freaks"". Although it is not the worst of the sequels, again, I have to cite II, IV, and VII since they stand out in their awfulness, this entry is still disappointing. It lacks suspense and scares and although this one tries to resurrect the werewolf transformation scene, it does so unsuccessfully and the end result is a werewolf that simply looks like a very tall, ugly man with body hair issues.The story centre's around Ian, a charming drifter who takes a job at a local church. This mysterious loner harbors a dark secret. You see, when the moon is full, he transform in to a hairy sasquatch .. I mean werewolf. Meanwhile, a travelling carnival arrives in town and one of its showcases is its freak-show complete with an alligator boy, a he-she, a three armed man and a clown who likes to chew off the heads of chickens (didn't see that one coming). The owner of this freak-show is R.B. Harker, a tall, masculine blonde with a flowing mane that would look great in a Harlequin romance novel cover and who also has a dark secret of his own. It is revealed that he is a loathsome, evil vampire who unmercifully exploits the freaks he takes under his wing. Harker, who is aware of Ian's secret, and can initiate a transformation by simply chanting some words, uses Ian as part of his carnival freak-show display. The sasquatch, ...  I mean werewolf here is the good guy and the climax is a showdown between Good and Evil. The idea is an interesting one and ""Howling VI"" pre-dates the current batch of werewolf vs vampire themed films such as the ""Twilight"" and ""Underworld"" saga. I just wished this had a bigger budget so more could have been accomplished. ""The Freaks"" is ambitious but rather clumsy and there are far too many quirky characters that it becomes a bit tiresome. The transformation scene is better than previous and later sequels, (""Howling II"", ""III"", ""IV"" and ""VII"" had cheesy man-to-wolf transformations), but where this one drops the ball is in the actual snout-less sasquatch... I mean, werewolf. At least give the beast a snout. This is not 1941. In this day and age, even by early 90's standards, we expect more from a cinematic werewolf than some contact lenses and glued on hair.Although far from being the worst, ""Howling VI: The Freaks"" will only amuse those undiscriminating horror fans with low expectations. Which is disappointing considering this had all of the potential of being a great entry in the series.""Howling Trilogy - Triple Feature"" does not include any extras, not even the trailers. All you get are the movies themselves along with their chapter selection so do not expect much. The quality of the films are very disappointing. The three movies show their age and unfortunately nothing was done to clean them up. This is especially true of the ""The Rebirth"". The transfer is sub-standard, looks grainy in several parts and the picture quality looks no better than the 20 year old VHS tape I originally had. For the price, this set is good enough. The only one worthy of buying individually if it is ever released in a more comprehensive DVD or Blue-ray, is ""The Rebirth"" but I am not holding my breath. The others, view with caution, but they are certainly entertaining in their own, low budget, B-movie kind of way and you can do much, much worse. ""Howling VII: New Moon Rising"" for example, makes these 3 films look flawless in comparison.",N/A

972863,"Teddy Pendergrass was one of the last great voices in R&B before the genre went belly up in the eighties. Teddy delivered both suave and gritty Soul in an era when disco and radio formats started to reign. His performances were at the same time highly erotic and uninhibited macho. With his mighty and gruff pipes he blew away the competition but could be very tender as well. Teddy is best known for his silky albums but was a mean live performer to boot. So naturally any live DVD should be welcomed. But as with many DVD releases of classic Soul artists this release just doesn't suffice. Although I wouldn't want to argue about the quality of the material that is there, which is exhilarating, it just isn't enough.

632655,"Viewed: 10/08Rate: 610/08: Although Coach Carter raises a lot of good points, it also invites several bad points as well. Samuel Jackson was good in his role, and he ought to do more of the same type of work because lately he has been doing crap. Outside of him, the cast was very good turning in surprisingly well-played performances. I find the plot behind Coach Carter to be all too familiar, ringing the feeling of ""been there, done it before."" One thing I hadn't really expected in Coach Carter is how far the discipline went. So, it was a warm welcome for me, and I enjoyed that very much. Moreover, I liked the fact that Coach Carter stresses the idea of ""teamwork"" as well as it did in G.I. Jane plus the fundamental importance of academics before athletics and life before basketball. That's why I liked the movie a lot, and it should relate very well to any teen of today. The basketball scenes featured in Coach Carter are of top-notch and contain really nothing fancy. In other words, I like to think Coach Carter of Hoop Dreams meets Hoosiers. As for the discipline side, it's almost Lean on Me; however, Joe Clark was there first. Now for the negatives of Coach Carter, I thought the profanity to be exceedingly too much for me, and I was incredibly disappointed in the usage of the language by the coach. It's so counterproductive and goes against what I believe in. Never in my life have I ever had a coach who uttered a four-letter word, and believe me, I have had a lot of coaches throughout childhood. Coach Carter should know better than that. Secondly, I was disappointed with lax strictness imposed by the coach especially when his players got caught sneaking away to a party filled with sex, alcohol, and probably drugs. I mean, what was that? That calls for a total expulsion of the players involved. But somehow, the coach swept it under the rug and moved on. I thought also that it was ridiculous that each time a player does something totally against Coach Carter's rules, he later gets taken back in form of begging. It's funny that when I finished the movie, I watched the special feature showing the real coach and the interviews by the former players. I was already informed by the ending of Coach Carter that many of them graduated from college and have degrees, but listening to the way they talk, they sure don't sound educated. Even worse, the coach would say things like, ""We was...,"" and ""They was..."" Come on, I expected a lot more from him. Another disappointing feature about Coach Carter is how good-looking everybody was. Sorry, it doesn't work that way in real world. Actually I found the ages of the actors playing high school basketball players to be hysterical. One of them is 27 when the movie was made; another was 22; another 23; another 26; and one was 31! That's why I knew how falsely portrayed their bodies were when it comes to high school setting. Another disappointment about Coach Carter is its advocate of abortion among teenage girls. That's just a poor message that was being given to impressionable kids and should have been completely dropped as a subplot from Coach Carter. What I said has nothing to do with my views on abortion because that's a very serious matter that ought to be explored elsewhere. Meanwhile, I remember one scene where there was a protest over the lockout, and some Asian dude just pumped his fist out. That was hilarious. Another scene shows a Latino getting gunned down due to a drug deal gone bad. Um, who cares? Is it just me, or do the high school cheerleaders look more like strippers? All in all, despite its MTV label, Coach Carter isn't a bad film but should be urged to be approached with some caution.",N/A

But to be fair it is much, much better than the DVD version.And for a ""30th Anniversary Edition!"" they added 2 things- ""Sing-Along with Annie"" which consists of, you guessed it, the portion of the movie with the song with subtitles. Lame. And the Ultraviolet version.Other than that, you still get the Aileen Quinn look-back from the regular DVD, as well as the laughably terrible ""Hard-Knock Life"" remake by ""Play"". Terrible.So, if you want widescreen and better picture quality, then buy it, but if you're expecting the stops pulled out, especially in light of the Broadway revival, don't.",Annie

609931,"The surprising success of Final Destination, ensured that it was only a matter of time before a sequel hit the screens, and surely not to disappoint, there it is.This success was interesting, because the film mixes your average blend of gore and thrills with the universal question of mortality: Can Death be inevitable? When the time comes, does it really mean just that and you can not escape it? (assuming the grumpy grim reaper has made too long a journey to go back empty handed!)Well,I seem to be in a minorty here, but I really did not like this sequel much. Not because it is a bad movie, it surely has its moments, but because I found it very similar to the first! Final Destination 2 is a bland, bland movie. I believe the filmmakers concentrated more on how to make the next death scene more gruesome and gory than the previous one, in a style that will make Dario Argento proud, instead of working on developing and expanding the story more. Surely they might have thought if the formula of the first film brought in the dollars, why not use the same one for the sequel, but somehow I found the two films identical as a result.Final Destination 2 is heavy without being intellectually challenging, and gruesome without being scary.The acting is pretty average as well,the best performance given by Final Destination veteran Ali Larter.On the other hand the Extras on the DVD are very good, exepct for the fact that there are '?' everywhere in the menu, which was very annoying! I mean did the studio assume that the viewer need all the help he/she can get in figuring out how to select the widescreen option??So at the end..(I am afraid I can not avoid this 'end', no matter how I try to escape it)..Final Destination 2 is Final Destination with new faces and new deaths.Nothing less, nothing more..",Final Destination 2
752633,"I have tried to own every old '70's Euro-sexplotation flick worth watching...so when I bought this film recently I had very high expectations.  I ended up giving it three stars because it hits the mark in some important areas, but misses the chance to be an excellent five star sex flick with others.  Is there naked women being abused in this film?  Yes.  Are the abuse scenes ""erotic enough"" to excite the common ""freaky"" viewers out there?  Somewhat.For example, in one sequence where a young, hot looking naked prisoner girl was caged and subsequently ""whipped"" by the transsexual wardon...the whipping of her breasts was done so gently and ridiculously fake...it was a phony turn off!However, in another sexual scene where a young prisoner girl was sold into sexual slavery to a rough looking guy on a fishing boat...his subsequent rape of that girl was a ""very hot"" sex scene and worth all three stars, in my rating of this film!  So you see folks...if you are looking for constant stimulation while watching this old sex classic...you have to look elsewhere, such as the film ""The Image"".I know there are couples out there just dying to get their hands on these old Euro sex flicks to watch after a nice dinner to lead them into a sexual fantasy mode...this movie may be good enough to do that for you...The hot sex scene on the boat with the kidnapped teen is worth a boner or two!",Sadomania

289495,"For what is included, this documentary is good. The music is great, the stories by historians and authors, especially Shelby Foote, are wonderful, and the images are often haunting.My big problem with this, however, is the limited scope. Considering the length, I was expecting so much more. After watching this long documentary, one would believe that Americans fought each other in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvannia over whether or not to free the slaves. For shame! The civil war is so much more. Burns focuses primarily on the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginia, while in reality the war was won in the west. Battles of the east were the biggest in terms of numbers but the battles in the west, discussed but practically ignored, were more important. Ft. Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, and Atlanta are in there, but not given their proper due. Not a word is said about battles west of the Mississippi, the complicated issues of European involvement are ignored, the importance of blockade-running dismmissed, technological advanced glossed over, anti-war movements in North and South forgotten, and the causes of the war are treated with all the complexity of a fourth grade book report. Any cause not not DIRECTLY related to the abolition movement is completely ignored (but what would you expect from PBS).That all being said, I really enjoy watching this dvd. I just remember that it is VERY imcomplete.I once heard it said that a person's enjoyment of this series was inversely related to how much one knows of the Civil War. I found this to be true. As I study the war in greater detail, my tolerance for this documentary has declined.",N/A

587726,"If you're selfish and self-absorbed (but don't know it), you'll probably love this colorful film about a single mother's 25-year climb to the best-seller list.  If not, you'll probably just shake your head.  The problem with ""Riding in Cars with Boys"" isn't that it lacks charm or humor; the problem is that it suggests that charm and humor in a person should supplant good judgment, character and sensitivity--even when that person is responsible for someone else.  Drew Barrymore gives her standard perky performance as Beverly Donofrio, a headstrong girl who defies her blue-collar parents (James Woods and Lorraine Bracco in interesting bits) and quickly finds herself pregnant.  Opting for marriage to a soon-to-be-junky loser (played effectively by Steve Zahn), Bev struggles to get to college but not before developing an angry Martyr Complex about her son and dabbling in the drug trade.  The movie's flashback scenes between the now successful Bev and the brash young woman she once was are at times effective--she actually seems a bit smarter and more sensitive in her youth--but too often we're supposed to chuckle at her poor decisions rather than hold her responsible for them.  In fact, the film seems to dodge the tougher question of why we should care about Bev in the first place, as she simply drifts from one crisis to the next, especially when her now-grown son points out all of the psychological trauma being her son has caused.  I guess it's supposed to be all that nostalgic music and Bev's pluck or maybe that she's a single parent.  It's nice that things work out for her in the end--the film is apparently based on an autobiography--but viewers may be left with little sense that the character deserves success so much as fell into it.  In terms of drama, that seems pretty weak.",Riding in Cars with Boys
207700,"This episode began one of the running themes of the original series: a deep-seated mistrust of machine-based intelligence. Oddly, TNG reversed this position, suggesting the polar opposite view that Lt. Commander Data was not only a benevolent being, but entitled to full rights as a person. Philosophically, you have to decide for yourself where you sit between these two extreme views. Machine intelligence: demonic or human?Another interesting feature of this episode is that it has echoes of the sci-fi classic ""Forbidden Planet,"" more even than ""The Menagerie."" Kirk beams down to a planet with Nurse Chapel to meet the latter's fiance, Dr. Roger Korby. Not heard from for five years, Korby has discovered the technology of a super, ancient civilization, which is now extinct.It turns out that this race of people was killed by the android servants they created. One of the androids, named Ruk, survives: he is played by Ted Cassidy, who played Lurch in ""The Adams Family."" Korby has discovered how to manufacture androids, as well as (gasp) transfer human consciousness into perfect, forever-young android bodies. To Kirk, this is bad, and Korby must be stopped. Korby tries to get around this by making a duplicate Kirk that he can give orders to.Events in the script suggest Kirk is right. Along with Kirk and Chapel, a couple of the hapless ""guys in red shirts"" beam down. Guess who are Ruk's first victims? A classic ST pattern is established: it's not good to be a guy in a red shirt, unless you're Scotty. Essentially, to android intelligence, life is cheap, and individuals are no more important than just another machine to be turned on or off.Many people who review this episode make much of Andrea (Sherry Jackson), the female android who Korby created as a companion. Chapel is quickly wise to what Korby has been up to. Andrea has soft skin like a woman's and can apparently execute all the normal functions, wink wink nudge nudge. The implication is that she is a very fancy life-sized doll or plaything. In his book ""Star Trek Memories,"" Shatner reports how before ST premiered, Roddenberry hired a model to appear at a sci-fi convention wearing Sherry Jackson's costume from this episode; she had to ""beat men off with a stick."" And it's hard to imagine that this model could have been more alluring than Ms. Jackson herself, who is really something. Hardly any other episode spurs males' fantasies as much as this one.Otherwise, you can watch this episode as a ""machine intelligence is evil"" morality tale, if that's your thing. But much of this episode has a creepy feel to it.",N/A

737386,"Halfway through Assignment: Outer Space, I thought this Italian effort had to be the worst, most boring science fiction movie I had ever seen in my life.  Then a funny thing happened - the story suddenly became interesting, a couple of the characters actually acquired something resembling a personality, and I actually had to begin rooting for the annoying reporter character who made the first forty-five minutes such an insufferably painful experience.  I'm not going to declare the movie good, but neither am I going to declare it bad.  It is interesting in its own peculiar ways, and - though I hate to admit it - I actually enjoyed it.Here's the basic story.  Roy Peterson (Rick Van Nutter) plays an annoying reporter sent into deep space for a story on the guys manning the space stations.  None of the astronauts want him there, especially the station commander - and that's even before they learn first-hand just what a pain in the patootie he really is.  Peterson's behavior doesn't help, as he's a know-it-all who doesn't believe in asking permission to do whatever he wants to do.  When the base commander receives urgent orders to travel to Mars, Peterson uses his connections to get himself invited along.  He doesn't know that it is a secret mission to save the Earth from a rogue space station rushing toward it; radiating incredible heat for a radius of 5,000 miles, it will turn the Earth into a blob of boiling mud once it goes into orbit.  Good old Earth looks like it's down for the count on this one.  It's going to take a miracle to get out of this jam, as all the bravery and heroics in the world can't seem to penetrate the heat shield and stop the tin can of death from its fateful rendezvous with the Earth.You don't see a lot of Italian science fiction films from the 1960s.  Assignment: Outer Space was, in fact, one of the pioneering efforts.  The brainchild of Antonio Margheriti, this 1960 film was shot and completed (and that includes the special effects) in a mere 20 days for less than $30,000.  The color of this film is so faded that I spent most of its 73 minutes trying to figure out whether or not I was actually watching a black and white print.  The special effects may be laughable today, but some (certainly not all) of them really weren't bad at all for their time (1960).  The explosion shots are pretty weak, the Mars scenes are best left forgotten (it's amazing how a moon can sneak up on you when you're not paying attention), but at least some thought went into many of the spaceship/space station shots (featuring vehicle separations, landings, spacewalks, and even a deep space refueling).  Here's a tidbit of trivia I found fascinating: knowing that viewers would undoubtedly look for the wires above the models, Margheriti attached wires to the bottoms of his models and filmed everything upside down.  Brilliant!",N/A

282464,"After the 2nd World War, Clark Gable was rarely able to recreate the excitement of so many of his thirties films. Not only was he ageing of course, but his biographers record that he never got over the loss of wife Carole Lombard in 1942. He was letting himself go. MGM, his home studio, clearly recognised the change and many of his postwar films are a trial. ""Mogambo,"" released in 1953, is a notable exception. John Ford filmed this action adventure and it is minor work in his canon, simply because the filming is straightforward and expert but with no particular Ford imprint.A remake of a previous success, the raunchy and funny ""Red Dust"" from 1932, Gable stars as an African game hunter on safari with 2 worthwhile leading ladies, the sensuous, amusing playgirl, Ava Gardner, and the icy, married Gracy Kelly. The plot is simple. Both woman fall for Gable and the melodrama revolves around how this plays out amongst lots of location shots of the scenary, native tribesmen and animals. Gable is perfectly cast as the macho hero and Gardner hits the right notes to make believable that she, 20 years his junior, would be his sort of woman. Kelly is much less successful and inferior to Mary Astor in the same role in the original film. Being an MGM star production, the ladies look ludicrously immaculate even on safari.The print is excellent preserving the glorious technicolour but there are no extras except the original trailer. The film is best value if purchased as part of the Gable Signature Collection.",N/A

December 21,2012 is the day that the Mayans predict a cataclysmic event will occur on earth,which has led to speculation that the world as we know will cease to exist.the movie only makes passing reference of the Mayan's,and instead just focus on on the destruction and mayhem side of things.maybe it's just me,but the special effects don't seems to have improved much in the last six years or so since the The Day After Tomorrow another big budget disaster opus,also from Roland Emmerich,which had a nearly comparable amount of CGI.or maybe i'm just jaded,and CGI really isn't that exciting more.either way,2012 failed to fully engage me,on an excitement level.the movie does however,has one thing in its favour.unlike many flicks of the genre,there were no real maudlin or sappy moments,no over the top corn ball inspirational speeches.and i loved Woody Harrelson's character.i also thought Thandie Newton was good as well.the movie wasn't boring.and for a movie that clocks in at 150 minutes before the end credits roll,that's something.for me,2012 is a 3/5",2012

1068771,"As the three stars indicate, I'm not asking how any show could possibly be any better than ""Space 1999.""  What I'm asking, kind of desperately, is: does the show itself get any better than where I stopped watching it?  That would be not quite halfway through the first season.  I simply couldn't watch any more episodes; it was too boring.  Which is unfortunate, because it's apparent from the episodes I did watch that the scripts were first rate science fiction - anything but the standard cookie cutter sci fi scripts which tend to occasionally infect even first rate productions (like Stargate and Star Trek).  I love offbeat sci fi shows like ""Starhunter,"" ""Firefly,"" ""Earth2,"" and the truly great British sci fi show ""Timeslip.""  In other words, this show should have grabbed me hook, line and sinker; but it didn't, so I have to assume it was the production values and not the stories that reduced the episodes to little more than a yawn. So I ask in all sincerity: did the producers pick up on the fact that the show was putting everyone to sleep and rev it up a bit as it went on?  Because I can't imagine anyone watching this for five seasons.  Now I'm a fan of Martin Landau, and Barbara Bain's ok, and Barry Morse is a terrific actor.  Maybe they just need to change roles with one another and it'll all be right?  Is that what happens?

863304,"""The Twilight Zone"" has seen a number of releases within the past score of years; the oldest one being by CBS Video Library which was sold by Columbia House from the early 1990s, later re-vamped onto DVD. Image Entertainment picked up the torch in 1999 when they released the entire series on DVD, but like Columbia House before them, Image did not disc the episodes in chronological order of airdate. Gold Entertainment released the series appropriately in 2000, correcting this long-standing inconvenience. There was also the release of ""Treasures from The Twilight Zone"" by CBS in 1992, which included five episodes from the series plus Rod Serling's initial network pitch which sold the series, and an interview with Mike Wallace done in 1959, prior to the show's original airing.2005 sees the re-release of the entire ""Twilight Zone"" canon by Image Entertainment; ""Twilight Zone"" is reportedly Image Entertainment's number-one selling DVD item, over and above every other product they sell.The earlier discs, which can still be ordered online from any number of outlets, have supplemental material written by Marc Scott Zicree, aka 'The Twilight Zone guru', who has spent the better part of thirty years on ""Twilight Zone""-related projects. Trivia quizzes, episode and season synopses, actor profiles, and other tidbits written by Zicree are included on the previous discs for more-than-casual fans, aided by clever and easy-to-navigate menus. The navigation of the present series of discs is not quite as effective; the same montages used on the Columbia House versions were utilized, and the viewer does not have the option to 'play all' the episodes on the disc at once (each episode has its own menu with chapters, and there is a sub-menu inconspicuously nestled in for each episode's special features, including commentary tracks.)The picture quality of both Image's and Gold's earlier discs was good overall, but a number of digital bloopers occur in nearly every episode. Image has supposedly re-mastered the footage from the original prints for the most recent release but this is more or less imperceptible for most of the episodes.Aside from a few nice added bonus features, ""Twilight Zone: The Definitive Edition"" looks to be yet another example of how Hollywood production companies jam-pack the product with goodies instead of focusing on quality and distinguishedness of the content and its presentation. The six-disc Volume 1 set comes with an unceremoniously tacked-on version of Zicree's somewhat controversial ""Companion"" guide to the series. Published in 1982, this is a book that every fan of the series likely already owns, and which over the years has garnered a reputation for slapdash treatment and commentary of the episodes. Zicree's magnetic-tape interviews with directors Douglas Heyes, Richard L. Bare, writer Richard Matheson, producer Buck Houghton and several others, are tacked on in the menu's Bonus Features section. If you can overlook the interviewer's approbing utterances of ""mhmm"" after nearly every sentence spoken by the interviewees, these are enjoyable.The notoriously ineffectual Radio Dramas (produced by Falcon Picture Group) - radio adaptations of many episodes, are included, presumably the result of a business deal aimed to promote a failing product. One has the option of listening to Kim Fields (""Tootie"" on the TV series The Facts of Life) drive the ultra-classic episode ""The After Hours"" into the ground after (or before!) watching Anne Francis spin Rod Serling's words into gold. Isolated scores for several episodes are included, but the only way the viewer can listen to them is against the backdrop of a silent version of the episode - that's right, you can listen to the music as you watch the characters mouthing all the dialogue. Surely the scores could have been released on the disc as MP3 files that could be played on most DVD players. Audio commentaries by stars Rod Taylor, Earl Holliman, Martin Milner, Martin Landau, and Kevin McCarthy and also former CBS President William Self are included. Inasmuch as it would've been nice to see these guys on camera again after so many years, their comments about the old days are splendid, despite a general lack of remembrance about working on the series (Milner spends a good three or four minutes discussing his current activities as host of a radio show on deep-sea fishing.)A sixth bonus DVD offers segments of the game show ""The Liars Club,"" (a real hoot, featuring Betty White and Dick Gautier on the panel of liars!); a gallery of photos with about ten commonly-seen production shots, a sales pitch of Serling's to a Netherlands network, and a blooper of Serling while filming the intro to the fourth season episode ""He's Alive."" A complete ""Twilight Zone"" comic book is also included, in PDF (Adobe Acrobat Reader) format, which can be viewed on computer.Thankfully, Image included the Rod Serling bumpers for next week's episodes, something which fans of the series have sought after for many years, and also the middle and ending billboards of Kimberly Clark and Sanka, ""Twilight Zone""'s sponsors of the first season. Clips of Serling claiming his two Emmys are welcome inclusions, as are two lectures Rod did around 1970 at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College, a seminar-based college in the Los Angeles area which featured lectures by such industry giants as Serling. The audio tracks for these were superimposed over the video tracks of ""Where Is Everybody,"" ""Walking Distance,"" and ""And When the Sky Was Opened"" (we assume these three episodes were the subject of Serling's lectures.) The track for ""Walking Distance,"" considered to be among the top five episodes of the series, is quite surprising as Serling denounces the storyline as flawed and illogical.The same format and general content look to be the same for Seasons 2 through 5.Fans of ""The Twilight Zone"" would probably do well to save $250-300 pick up a used copy of Gold Entertainment's complete version - minus the aforementioned bells and whistles.And if you're thinking about leaving negative feedback for this review, you need to accept reviews that tell it like it is, even if the comments aren't brimming with praise!",The Twilight Zone: Season 1

The thought being that the people there don't care about plot and characters and things of that nature so why even bother. We saw it with ""Executive Decision"" and ""Under Siege 2,"" and Hollywood never thinks it gets old.  Not that this dreck is all that bad, but it is certainly straight out of the Hollywood playbook.  If they had kept it as a psychological thriller then maybe I could have recommended this film. Rather they felt the need to throw in gun fights and explosions and things of that nature just so that it felt like a real action picture.  Also, the ending was so contrived and predictable that it destroyed any chance I had for liking this movie (what do you think happens when somebody has five chances to do something?).  This movie also had a fair share of other problems.  Some of the one-liners in this film could make your hair curl (""Somebody turn out the lights""). Whoever wrote this should consider themselves lucky that they didn't have to read their own lines out loud in front of a camera.  There was also the much criticized scene in which they play the song ""Hey Ya"" by OutKast. Of course we all know that some overpaid over-educated producer thought that was the best way to appeal to the kids, but they totally botched the delivery of the song.  If they had just played it in the background and left the characters out of it then it could have fit into this little tale of escapism.  However, they had the characters actually listening to it out in the middle of the desert and expending valuable energy dancing to it.  Now we all know OutKast is catchy, but it came off as one big commercial for them in that scene.  On the positive side the acting by Giovanni Ribisi and Dennis Quaid was very good (anybody else find it ironic that Quaid's career is hotter right now than Meg Ryan's?), unfortunately they were surrounded by a bunch of overacting hacks who had no clue as to how to read a line.  There were also some very cool camera shots that work because they fit into the film.  This film wanted to be nothing more than mass entertainment, and I have to give it to them they were pretty entertaining. That is a lot more than ""the Grudge"" can say. However, that can not erase all the aforementioned problems, so I'm not going to recommend it, but only by a hair.  ***",Flight of the Phoenix

With the exception of the Scully/Mulder relationship, which Duchovny and Anderson easily stepped back into, this film contained none of what made the series so interesting. By that, I mean there is none of the mythology here, and that's a shame. It's been six years since the series ended, ten years since the last motion picture, and what we get is a modern-day Frankenstein story.This film has a lot to recommend it: Duchovny and Anderson take on the personas of Mulder and Scully as if no time had passed; the movie is beautifully filmed and acted; Amanda Peet was surprisingly good (as she often is); and Billy Connolly is surprisingly sympathetic as a pedophile priest. That being said, I'm not sure Chris Carter and company fully understood what the fan were looking for here.

I grew up with a sister in beauty pageants, so I can tell you that the satire is not too far off base.My biggest problem was that I just didn't understand the motivation for Joey Lauren Adams's character to continue to put up with all of the things that Minnie Driver's character dished at her.  Who would put up with that stuff?  The complexity of Minnie Driver giving up her child to Joey Lauren Adams while still living with her is not true-to-life.  Imagine the emotional issues this would cause with all three of them - yet, they seem to see this sort of thing as &quot;normal.&quot;I was not disappointed in the acting and did shed a tear at the end of the movie.

In this film, I got what I was looking for, but I also got a lot that I could have done without. The film is done entirely in a stark, glaring black and white, so that often you can't tell what exactly is happening, but often I don't think you're supposed to. There are some truly disturbing, morbid and bloody scenes, notably the opener with ""God Killing Himself"" and the torture and murder of Earth Mother and the Son of Earth. There were scenes that I didn't understand but which still affected me deeply- the twitching and convulsing of the Son of Earth, as though he were in constant agony even when nothing was being done to him, the lurching and shambling druid-creatures and mummers and their odd rituals of feeding the earth.Unfortunately there were also endless scenes that bored me so that I nearly fast-forwarded through them (I didn't, though). There's only so long you can watch a bunch of druids dragging a twitching body across the rocky ground before you wonder where they're going with it already. I was also annoyed at the way Mother Earth seemed not to mind at all that her son was being murdered until they started beating up on her as well. She always seemed really removed from the whole thing.It was extremely compelling, even in the most drawn-out moments. I'm not sure if I ""liked"" this movie yet.

Much like Cribb himself, who is infamous for his unending patience when trying to get to the bottom of a case, you will likely have to be just as patient, wading through these episodes, awaiting the resolution.

901696,"Overall this is a pretty good movie, though it is a rather dark and dramatic tale.This movie is based on a book, written by the girl who lived through this to find herself. I have not read the book so I can't compare it.This would not be a good date movie or family movie, too much drama and adult content.The story follows a troubled girl, a writer, just as she finishes high and moves away to college. And while she seems to have all the opportunities in the world, she also has a lot of personal issues, not the least of which is a broken home and self hatred. Of course college doesn't ""make her all better"" and she begins a downward spiral and ends up going into therapy, and eventually put on perscription medication. She loves and looses friends and relationships along the way, as well as her ability to write. Interesting story.The acting was great, very dramaticly intense scences that made you feel for the girl. The story was a little slow in areas (not sure how the book faired with this), and some very odd directing in areas as well (that could either be enriching or distracting depending on your tastes).I think I would buy this movie for my collection, though I doubt I would watch it a lot.",Prozac Nation

1018334,"One thirdThe Ring+ two thirdsWhite Noise+ a dash ofThe Terminator= a surprisingly disappointing entry into the current Asian influenced horror flicks.The plot is simple.  It opens with a college student that appears to be following a lead on something happening on campus that few are aware of and what happens to him leads to an epidemic of suicides as his girlfriend attempts to unravel the mystery behind his death and those of her friends that follow.  There is a lot of psycho-babble drivel thrown around but no one really seems upset about things like we might be in real life.  This is a direct result of tepid acting, shallow writing, and pedestrian direction.The characters in this story are a group of rather unremarkable and stereotypical college students who are all rather forgettable soon after the film is over and that means that this film never really takes off as we never care much for any of them.  This is what I meant in my headline that this film actually lacks a pulse.  All the males are your typical long, uncombed hair, five o'clock shadow, 20 somethings with little to no personalities.  I can barely tell one from the other.  The same is true for the women who, although pretty, are shallow personality-wise.  This causes the film to lack serious suspense which is created when we care about the characters such as we did with those in ""The Ring"" and ""White Noise"".Speaking of those two outstanding films, this film attempts to mimic elements in them in regards to appearance with its sharp contrasts and washed out colors and the idea that ghosts need conduits to reach us and they don't always play nicely when they do.  Both films also relied upon jolting images that suddenly appear (which has become rather old at this point, much like the overuse of CGI effects)  In addition, this film attempts to tack on the message that we are too dependent on technology which is reminiscent of themes found in ""The Terminator"" films.  Ironically, the film even has an effectively haunting scene in which we see ghosts all over cities and that reminds one ofNight of the Living Deadand28 Days Later.So, with all this negativity, why did I still give this film 3 stars, which means it's good and why did I add it to my shopping cart?  Well, I like the influence of the Asian horror films in that I like the ""look"" of them, the creepiness, the jolting, disturbing images, and such even when the whole film isn't that great.  In addition, while this film certainly isn't original, I do like the components that are copied from better films.  It is still a fun, creepy ride even though we've been on this roller coaster many times before.  Lastly, at PG-13 or even the ""Unrated"" edition this film is one I can watch with my kids (11 and 15).  There are no ""sex scenes"" or anything vividly violent as in a typical ""slasher"" type film.  It's just a creepy film that has some good repeat value.Do I ""recommend"" this film.  No, not really and especially not to those who have tired of this genre already, but those who like this kind of film no matter how redundant or ill-produced, will get a decent kick out of it.BTW:  In regards to Star Ratings, I've read many discussion comments lately that note that 3 stars is poor on Amazon.  I'm not sure where that is coming from as I understand the rating system to be something like this:* = Poor** = Fair*** = Good**** = Excellent***** = OutstandingJust my thoughts on this and I'm sure opinions and interpretations may vary.

543475,"""Rush Hour 2"" is a highly enjoyable follow-up to the original 1998 box office smash.  Like the previous film, this first of what will undoubtedly be a long line of lucrative sequels combines sardonic humor with eye-popping martial arts action sequences to entertaining effect.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan repeat their roles as unlikely cop buddies, starting off the film in Chan's home territory, Hong Kong, and finishing up in Tucker's, the good ole US of A.Chan, with his sheepish deadpan delivery, makes a perfect straight man for Tucker's fast-talking bad brotha wiseacre, whose mouth engages in more heavy-duty action than Chan's karate-chopping hands and feet.  Much of the humor is generated by Tucker's ability to seem totally unflustered by any peril that happens to come his way, managing to sass talk his way out of one dangerous predicament after another.  Moreover, Chan's ability to create humor out of perfectly choreographed stunt sequences puts him right up there with some of the silent comedy greats like Chaplin and Keaton.  The split-second perfection of these scenes, combined with the balletic grace with which they are executed, makes him one of the truly unique talents working in movies today.  Luckily, in his move to mainstream American filmmaking, Chan has been able to find behind-the-scenes talent good enough to match his own.  The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson, though no world-beater when it comes to originality or depth, does posses a playful spirit that works well in the context of the genre.  Likewise, director Brett Ratner keeps the action percolating along at a lively, often dizzying clip.As with most Chan films, however, ""Rush Hour 2"" seems to go on for about a half hour too long - even though its running time barely clocks in at a very short 90 minutes.  Perhaps this type of material really can't be sustained much beyond an hour before the repetitiousness of it begins to take its toll.  However, that is certainly a minor quibble about a film that, for the most part, provides plenty of laughs, some kick-... performances and action sequences that, as per usual for a Chan film, will, quite literally, make your jaw drop.  .",N/A

Travers was an artist with a Jungian orientation and a lot of ideas about mythology etc., but the movie presents her as a tiresome egotistical neurotic who secretly wallows in sentimentality.  It also soft pedals Disney's disingenuous insistence on using animation in the film.  In fact, the animation in Mary Poppins is lousy, and I've read that Travers confronted Disney angrily about it after the premier and was more less told, ""tough, little lady."" The Los Angeles and London segments are fun, but the Australian part mostly is an over-sentimentalized bore, except for the arrival of the ""original ""Mary Poppins"" toward the end.  Would have liked more of that.  And, speaking of veracity, couldn't Disney Inc. afford to do Australian locations in Australia instead of California?

Hilarious bits like how newlywed writer Tobey Maquire hires a oriental call girl for a tryst turning into a brush with death calling at the wrong door, Demi Moore as a psychiatrist who starts being ""Jewish with a vengeance"", Woody Allen going to Hades with sulphurous Billy Crystal as the Devil--well, they keep the film afloat.

485800,"For all but his most ardent fans, Italian director Lucio Fulci can be somewhat of an acquired taste.  Memorable more for their gore than for coherent plotlines, Fulci's oeuvre boasts outrageous imagery that often tests the gag reflex of the most hardened horror veterans: major eyeball damage is always a threat for the characters who populate Fulci's world, as is throat ripping, flesh melting, chain flogging, head crushing, gut munching and any other other disgusting fate that can be conjured up by the human mind.  All this, and more, is on vivid display in what many fans consider to be Fulci's masterpiece, ""The Beyond"".  Certainly, ""The Beyond"" is (I think) his most lavishly baroque excursion into the grotesque, although describing it as a ""masterpiece"" might be a stretch. Since the film's 1981 release, movie special effects have come a long way, but, to be sure, the blood and gore on display here are plenty revolting, even in scenes where the moviemaker's trickery is obvious.The plot, such as it is, involves a hotel in the Louisiana bayou that is situated over one of the seven doors to hell.  In the early part of the 20th Century, a horde of angry townsfolk (who make the angry townsfolk in Universal's ""Frankenstein"" movies look like the Seven Dwarfs) track a local artist to the aforementioned hotel, where, believing him to be a warlock, torture and murder him in the grisliest manner.  Fast forward 50 or so years, when a young New Yorker named Liza inherits the hotel and sets about renovating the crumbling structure. This does not set well with the demonic residents, who immediately embark upon a course of gruesome mayhem that, somehow, goes undetected for much of the film by our heroine and her new friend, John, the local doctor.  There's a blind girl named Emily, who seems to have dropped in from some sort of limbo, essentially to set up the other characters as sacrifices, but who ends up (to her detriment) being more of a help than a hindrance.  Other characters come and go, some showing up, seemingly, for the sole purpose of dying a hideous death, and things happen that move  the story nowhere, but the atmosphere Fulci creates is genuinely creepy, and there are some evocative shots of New Orleans.  In fact, the movie, lovingly restored and presented by Anchor Bay, looks great, beautiful, in fact, in spite of the horrific murders.The performances are really not as bad as I'd feared (and heard).  Fulci regular, Catriona MacColl, gives a spirited performance as the attractively spunky (if none too bright) Liza.  Although British, MacColl makes a convincing American yuppie-type, while David Warbeck, also a Brit, plays it strait-laced to the point of being wooden, as the local doctor/hero.  Also memorable is ""Inferno's"" Veronica Lazar, as the hotel maid; with her wild hair and slovenly manner, she lurks in the shadows knowingly,  a little like Agnes Moorehead in ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"".  Cinzia Monreale, as the blind Emily, with her ominous warnings and flighty departures, makes the most of a role both sympathetic and menacing.  The rest of the players are interesting, too, although few are allotted more than a few minutes of screen time.At its best, ""The Beyond"" is like a carefully crafted, beautifully filmed nightmare that is effective and disturbing, without having a particularly coherent narrative.  However,  that is almost overridden by Fulci's penchant for lingering lovingly on gross-out scenes of carnage--sometimes for minutes at a time--which seems gratuitous, bordering on obscene.  But that's Fulci, extreme and fearless as a filmmaker, so you either take him or leave him. Having heard so much about this film through the years, I really wanted to like it more than I do.  As it is,  ""The Beyond"" has a fantastic look and feel--the atmosphere, in this case, is almost everything--but you have to possess a certain amount of patience and have a certain sensibility (not to mention, the stomach) for this kind of thing, otherwise you're not likely to appreciate it.",N/A

Rudd's an identifiable guy here, particularly for the crowd that doesn't buy into Budweiser brand of masculinity, but he's so thoroughly, maddeningly passive that the puns occasionally feel staged. It's funny, with a few genuine laugh-out-loud moments, but also safe like a sitcom given the green light to tinker with a dirty theme or two and actually wrap up its primary storyline.

611644,"Ok, so maybe it's not ""Animal House"", but in a time of silly teen comedies, ""Old School"" delivers exactly what you can imply from the title. Also, it's just another excuse to watch Will Ferrell (one of the funniest guys alive in my opinion) doing what he does best: make us laugh until we fall from our seats. Also, this Unrated version is the one you want to have, where they make sure not to hold back any punches. And did I mention that, for a change, the special features [aren't bad]?The plot is the least important thing. Actually, it's very formulaic: Luke Wilson's character buys a house on campus territory and lets his crazy friends (played by Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell) to make a giant monster of a party. It's so wild, that the next day he is kicked off the University grounds by the Dean (played by Jeremy Piven, who does the complete opposite of his character in ""PCU""). So the three friends have only one solution: start a fraternity. From then on, you know the drill. They have to overcome all obstacles and beat the system that's trying to bring them down.The movie is also a wonderful parody of ""Fight Club"", not only because of key scenes involving the recruiting of new frat members, but also because it carries the same load of self-destruction, especially regarding the character of Will Ferrell: Frank the Tank, a guy who realizes he doesn't want to live the life of a married man and returns to the life he used to have in college, mainly becoming a sloppy drunk. You can see also lots of cameo appearances, like 24's Elisha Cuthbert, Juliette Lewis, Sean William Scott and Snoop Dog. The humor in this film is very 80's, but it doesn't come close to the stupidity of teen films like ""American Pie"", ""Not Another Teen movie"" or ""Just Married"". This one is made by proffesionals, and you can see that.Now, for the edition, I think the best thing is the Inside the Actors Studio spoof. I would buy the DVD for this feature alone! You know from SNL that Will Ferrell does a great impersonation of James Lipton, and here he does a 20-minute piece in which Lipton interviews him and the rest of the cast. The fact that no one is laughing and the interview has a ""serious"" tone makes it even funnier! Just watch it and you'll pass out laughing. I know I did. The other features are ok, but this is the one to check out.So, in conclusion, ""Old School"" may not be the best comedy around, but it makes a sincere effort in avoiding the cliches of today's comedies and return to hard-core stuff with great, experienced comedians. For all fans of will Ferrell is a must see, but if you want the best college comedies, you're better off getting ""Animal House"". This one I'd recommend to rent and then you'll see for yourself.",Old School
1135468,"Fans of mecha-themed anime looking here for the next great series may be somewhat disappointed with what 'Aquarion' has to offer.  Coming from a great pedigree (created by Shoji Kawamori, who was involved with 'Escaflowne' and 'Macross' amongst others) the show initially seems to have plenty of promise but within the first 2 episodes fans of the genre will be slightly off-put by the derivative storyline and characters.  Which is really quite a shame because storyline aside 'Aquarion' is a very handsome series with terrific mech design and sprinkled throughout with some truly beautiful background art.As for packaging goes, Funimation has done a great job in putting together a well-designed set with each of the 3 discs housed in their own wonderfully illustrated slimpack cases.  A transparent pencil board is also nicely included and packed within the slipcase.  As expected ample extras are also included (all on disc 3).  They include:+Clean, opening and ending segments+6 minute interview with Shoji Kawamori+18 minute fan Q&A; session with Kawamori and voice cast+4 shorts examining the themes of the showVideo and Audio quality are also consistently excellent throughout.  The English voice track is also done very well and encoded in 5.1 Dolby.  Sadly, the superb Japanese track is only available in 2.0 Stereo.","Aquarion: Season 1, Part 1"
824688,"Remember David Soul and Paul Michael- Glaser in the old Starksy and Hutch action series from the 1970's? If you're trying to put it behind you, then you may not want to see this movie. But for those who loved the show and who like cheesy comedies, this 2004 big screen rendition might be for you.The stars this time around are Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the roles as David Starsky and Ken Hutchinson respectively. Stiller is a more serious character and Wilson is more laid back and funny, even bordering on stupid at times. The two don't seem to get along that well, but they end up as partners regardless as they try to complete a drug sting. Along they way, they get some help from a character named Huggy Bear, played by Snoop Dogg- one of the best parts of the film. Huggy Bear seems like a cool, slick helpful type of guy, but you don't really know whose side he is on. Snoop Dogg is, basically, playing himself in this role. He always has that cool, calm, confident demeanor no matter when I see him on the small or large screen.The music in this film comes from the 1970's, and much of it is forgettable, just like the 1970's were forgettable. One particularly nauseating scene (or funny, depending on how you look at it) has Owen Wilson taking a guitar from his partner and proceeding to play the song ""Don't Give up on Us"". Most viewers won't recognize this song at all, but it is, in fact, an old hit single from the 1970's by the original Hutch, David Soul.Some of the comedy here is funny, but other parts of the movie don't quite seem to hit the mark. However, the action scenes and the nostalgic value are enough to recommend watching this movie. It isn't the greatest, but it has enough entertainment value to make it worth paying a few dollars to see on video.",Starsky & Hutch VHS

553543,"Orson Welles directed ""Lady from Shanghai"" and stars as Michael O'Hara, a mysterious down-on-his-luck sailor.  As the film opens, O'Hara meets the beautiful Rosalie Bannister (Rita Hayworth) by rescuing her some street thugs; however, little is as it seems, and O'Hara finds himself quickly drawn into Rosalie's life.  Turns out that Rosalie is actually married to a powerful lawyer, Arthur Bannister.  Soon O'Hara, against his better judgment, is working on the couple's yacht and everything gets more and more complicated.""Lady from Shanghai"" is one of Hayworth's most famous starring roles, and it's easy to see why - she looks amazing and is quite good.  However, the film is disappointing.  In particular, the plot is unnecessarily convoluted: the focus seems to be on fancy camera work.  The close-ups and numerous pans certainly create an atmospheric film.  After revolutionizing movie directing six years earlier with ""Citizen Kane,"" Welles was obviously wont to continue his flashy directing here.  However, the elements don't mesh well, at the expense of character and plot development.  Film noir is always a risky proposition because of the labyrinthine plots, but one cannot rely on atmosphere alone.  Also, the film veers toward haminess at times, particularly Welles' thick Irish brogue.  The movie is, however, undeniably fascinating.  The hall of mirrors sequence is especially fun, although it's been emulated many times since.The backstory is also typical of a Welles film.  Despite being known for her long red hair, Welles had Hayworth cut her get her hair cut short and dyed platinum blonde.  The studio understandably had a fit: just one more of Welles' career battles with producers.  In this case, however, Welles did not deliver an incontestable classic with the mettle of a ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Magnificent Ambersons.""  Instead, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" is an atmospheric but somewhat bizarre film noir that stops well short of greatness; nevertheless the film is a must-see for a number of reasons.",N/A

But the evil Profion plots to usurp her control. Meanwhile, Ridley and Snails are two thieves, unhappy with the Mages' dominance. While stealing from the Mages, the two find themselves wrapped up in a search for a mythical rod that could mean certain destruction if it falls into Profion's hands.  The film has an impressive cast including: Jeremy Irons (Profion), Bruce Payne (Damodar), Justin Whalin (Ridley), Marlon Wayans (Snails), Thora Birch (Empress Savina) and Zoe McLellan (Marina). The comical and almost cartoonish feel make for a fun and light-hearted fantasy with plenty of magic, dragons, and heart. Those unfamiliar with the game (like me) with little-to-no expectations, this was a fun and fast-paced adventure when it released in 2000. Re-watching it in 2011, I found it much more corny, with out-dated special effects. Yet, it was still enjoyable following the thief characters and their party.Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God (2005)Damodar plans revenge against the kingdom of Izmer, capturing a powerful orb in order to summon a dragon to destroy the kingdom. The warrior Berek and mage Melora, along with a diverse group of heroes, fight to reach the orb before Damodar's plans unfold. Bruce Payne (Damodar) is the only returning main character for the sequel. Though, the acting and special effects once again fall flat. The pacing is off and I became confused several times throughout the film, wondering if familiarity with the game is necessary to understand all of the plot elements. This sequel has little else in common with its predecessor. Where the previous was fun and light-hearted, this installment is very violent and humorless.

1462961,"A classic plot line in American Westerns is the ""defend your land"" scenario where a small group (usually a family) needs to fight against some outsiders (be they bloodthirsty Apaches or rival ranchers or a vengeful gang of criminals) who want to muscle in. The plot has been used again and again in many genres. One recent entry is Joe Cornish's Attack the Block, a science fiction alien invasion version of the story.Set in south London, the story begins with a gang of young hoodies who mug a woman on Guy Fawkes Night (which explains the fireworks in the sky). They get interrupted by something crashing down from the sky that's not a firework. The object wrecks a car. The head hoodie, a boy named Moses, investigates the car and discovers some kind of wolf/dog monster who scratches him up. Moses and his posse hunt down the creature. After they kill it, they realize it must be some alien and they think they can cash in if they find some interested scientist or TV program. So they head to the safest spot they know, the local drug dealer's ""weed room,"" where he grows marijuana. They run into Hi-Hatz, the sadistic drug lord for the neighborhood. Hi-Hatz recruits Moses to sell for him, giving Moses a small amount of drugs. The boys have bigger problems when more alien creatures come crashing down and threaten the 'hood.The movie is standard B-movie fare--the creatures are scary but not too scary; the comedy is okay but not great; bigger issues (in this case racism) are touched on but not dealt with in depth. The story keeps viewers engaged because the characters are more like real people than like stereotypes or archetypes (though the aliens are pretty one-dimensional). Even though the gang is very unsympathetic at the beginning, they show a lot more of their humanity and vulnerability as the story goes on.The woman they mugged is an ongoing character. When she is reunited with the gang through circumstance, their interactions are real and they come to understand each other better. This plot line provides a center to the movie that keeps it from being too cliched or too formulaic or too uninteresting. The realness of the relationships raises this to the high end of the B-movie category.",Attack the Block

597471,"Latest installment of 007 manages to honor the traditional Bond elements while also keeping stride with modern times. The story centers around Bond's attempt to track down a North Korean Army officer who is illegally receiving diamonds smuggled out of South Africa and using the resulting wealth to build a satellite that will harness the power of the sun. Bond also has his sights on a mystery figure inside the British government who betrayed him, resulting in his being imprisoned and tortured in North Korea for 14 months. The film makes a few weak attempts at humour but overall has a very dark and somber tone. The opening sequence showing 007's torture at the hands of his North Korean captors is quite intense compared to the traditional Bond formula where he's rarely in true peril. The scenes set in the villian's 'house of ice' are really spectacular and to me are the film's best moments. The one truly cheesy scene in this movie is the cartoonish image of Bond riding a makeshift surfboard on the waves from a melting iceberg. The shot is phoney-looking beyond belief and downright silly. Halle Berry does an OK job as an American CIA agent who teams up with Bond. Madonna shows up for a totally lame, wooden cameo that the film would be better without. I'm also not a fan of her monotonous techno-flavored theme song for the film. Overall, not a bad movie and should certainly please Bond diehards if they're not put off by the film's gritty, somber feel.

The writing in this 1992 series may not be quite as well done as the earlier episodes but I may just be nitpicking, because they are still funnier than most other comedies ever produced! When I say funny I mean that they allow the humor to seep into your soul gently and naturally. They are not thrown in your face or laced with vulgarity. The Yorkshire scenery is just a beautiful as ever, and the supporting characters add humor and charm to an already hilarious trio of the most ""irresponsible barmpots"" in all of England! I do have a complaint (and the reason for 4 stars not 5) about the DVD's for this whole series, and that is - there are no extras to allow the fan an inside look or to look behind the camera. A show of this quality deserves the very best marketing and the fans deserve the very best packaging! Come on BBC....don't short-change this classic treasure!Edit: I want to add something I have noticed. Some, not all, of the episodes have been edited and scenes cut short! This is sad and a bit disappointing. I only noticed it because I recorded many episodes off my local PBS satation prior to getting the dvd's.

But things go wrong: the President is shot, a nearby hotel is bombed, and finally the podium area of the summit is bombed.

It's too bad director Pete Travis and company couldn't have told a more straightforward story instead of stooping to a gimmick like this. We're lucky it just lasts 90 minutes.

1163636,"I bet you cannot watch this movie without asking yourself, ""How much of this is true?"" Not just what's verified and what is speculation, but how accurate do you suppose the guesses are? It's very spooky, this movie. Holding a mirror up to what we have just lived through, and at a time when we did not yet know whether Obama would win and change things, or McCain would win and continue the basic plan.For one thing, most of the people who play well-known figures look quite like their roles, even Richard Dreyfuss as Darth Cheney. In fact, Josh Brolin as W. and James Cromwell as H.W. are the only two who are not particularly look-alikes, in that both actors are rather more lean and angular than the presidents were. Thandie Newton is positively spooky as Condi Rice. Toby Jones is a little smaller than Karl Rove, but just as slimy. Jeffrey Wright does not at first look all that much like Colin Powell, but he grows into the role -- or his makeup does.The early part of W's life is the only part we have not seen before, although we certainly heard about it. We see his fraternity initiation, but not his Skull and Bones one. We see him chatting up a Texas gal and persuading her that he's going to marry her, and then later hear that his father had to ""take care of her"" when she came up pregnant. He's in jail for reckless driving, and his father bails him out. But in his job in the oil fields, his try at Wall Street, and especially his lack of focus more generally, H.W. is deeply disappointed, and says so. In real life and in W.'s nightmares.We are also ""treated"" to his drying-out from alcohol, his born-again experience, his belief that God was calling him to run for president. Still, there seems to be more of the whiff of brimstone than the odor of sanctity about the man, especially ending every cabinet meeting with a silent prayer. If it was not phony, I almost wish it had been.The decision to invade Iraq, the Cheney power hunger, the way everyone in that cabinet room could go along with Cheney's plan to take over the entire middle east by surrounding and then conquering Iran; it's all so spooky that I simply cannot help asking myself: how much of this is the truth?It's a well-made movie about a very unsettling topic, and I would have preferred if the two men who portrayed the Bush presidents looked a little more like the real Bushes. Can't have everything. I would also have like more about some topics and less about others, but on the whole, the story hangs together as the biography of a man who never should have been elected to any office, let alone the presidency.",W

893040,"Shakespeare's lines will carry any movie above the waterline, and the same can be said of Pacino's acting. They both make this movie presentable and even excellent at times. However, the angle of the movie seems to be one of contradiction to the text, beginning with the introductory text prior to the film's dialogue (text from the Director NOT Shakespeare). This text attempts to excuse the very play itself for its characterization of Christians and the Jew, Shylock. If the play needed an intro, Shakespeare would have written a prologue. It certainly works to bias the audience in a way. The other attempt to do this is several scenes where the ""Christian"" characters are carousing in a bawdy house with a bunch of half-naked prostitutes. Clearly, the director attempts to make a martyr of Shylock and hypocrites of all the non-Jew characters: however Shakespeare's text is what it is. The nudity is utterly unnecessary and detracts from the integrity of the play--plus it cannot now be shown to young people.Other than those detractions, I think the film is excellent. The trial scene is superb and brings the tension of the moment to life. Besides Pacino the other actors do a fine job. Unfortunately, though I am a lover of Shakespeare, I would not want to watch this again.Author of ""Shakespeare on Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays""",William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice
242265,"When this movie debuted in 1987, I remember that it was really hyped, so much so that I thought it was destined to be a classic.  Not so, as 17 years later, the world has pretty much forgotten it.  I rented it for the nostaglic value and found it interesting, in a neon-glowing, teased-hair sort of way...The movie revolves around three high-school friends named Clay, Blair, and Julian.  Upon graduation, each has a different plan for his or her life.  Clay heads straight to college, Blair blows off post-secondary education to pursue a modeling career, and Julian attempts to become a nightclub entrepreneur.When Clay comes for the Christmas holidays, his first holiday from college, he finds that the friendship has changed in six months, and not for the better.  Julian is now a coke addict, and Blair, after a brief fling with Julian, is now an occasional user.  Julian is dogged by a menacing drug dealer named Rip to whom he ownes a large sum of money.  Julian's addiction and loan delinquincy drag Clay and Blair with him on a downward spiral as they attempt to get him clean and run interference with Rip.  The ending is rather predictable, but I won't give it away.For Robert Downey Jr., LTZ must have been a case of art imitating life.  His role as a cocaine addict must not have been too inaccurate a representation of his own drug woes.",Less Than Zero VHS

504948,"Summary:Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) is something of a 'do everything man' in a small town in New Hampshire (crossing guard, policeman, snow plower, etc.).  The problem is that he has never been able to get out of the town.  He has a daughter with a woman that lives elsewhere and is currently seeing Margie Fogg (Sissy Spacek).  His brother, Rolfe Whitehouse (Willem Dafoe) is a history professor at Boston University and his father, Glen Whitehouse (James Coburn), is abusive.  The movie focuses on a very short period in Wade's life when everything just kind of falls apart.  He is trying to get his teenage daughter to spend time with him, but she doesn't want to and he can't really get visitation rights because he gave those away in the divorce hearing.  His best friend, Jack Hewitt (Jim True), takes a man out hunting and the man accidentally shoots himself.  Wade thinks that Jack did it.  Wade also finds out that his boss, Gordon LaRiviere (Holmes Osborne) is in cahoots with another man and together they are buying up all of the town property to develop it.  Then when his mother dies, perhaps due to neglect on the part of his father, and Wade moves in with his father, everything begins to collapse.  He loses his job, loses Margie, then loses his daughter and his sanity.  This is when Glen pushes him over the edge by hitting him over the head with a bottle of whiskey.  Wade finally retaliates and, in doing so, kills his father.  He then sets his father on fire and burns down the barn his dad in it.  We find out later that Wade, still convinced that his best friend Jack killed the wealthy hunter, kills Jack and skips town.My Comments:The story is definitely very complicated, but not necessarily hard to follow.  A lot of time is spent in vehicles, driving here and there as Wade tries to work out his life.  In watching some of the special features on the DVD, it becomes apparent that this movie is all about what abusive parenting does to children (perhaps saying something about me that I needed the special features to really bring that out for me).  I can't even imagine what it is like, though I'm sure this movie probably hits home for some people.  I didn't grow up with an abusive father so the movie didn't resonate with me.  I just kept thinking that the movie was about a bunch of messed up people, which, as it turns out, was the whole point of the movie.Overall, the acting is convincing.  James Coburn and Nick Nolte in particular, are very good.  The story usually keeps you interested, but not always.  It almost seems like it is supposed to be a murder mystery and you would think that that plot line would drive the story, but it isn't about the murder in the end, it is about Wade dealing with the abuse, which is what is really driving the erratic story.  The movie is worth seeing, but I don't know that I would highly recommend it.  Well-done, but unless you can really relate, it is probably just a sad, hard-to-understand story.",Affliction VHS
1462427,"It's harder than you would think to make an action adventure film based on the pulp simplicity of the old timers. More so now than ever before, action films have drawn upon each other from years - even months - past, all for the sake of placing a stake in present ideologies and notions of what these specific movies are meant to represent. It's limiting, but it can usually mean a quick buck or two for those limited directors who put a bit of effort into creating something moderately intriguing.And then, we have Captain America. Before I could begin to study an odd, nostalgic throwback into the very recent voids of American cinema, Joe Johnston did it for me. Joe Johnston's interpretation of Marvel's sanctuary isn't modern; it's hardly memorable. That said, if Captain America: The First Avenger is anything, it isn't nauseously replicated by experiences months past. It is retro, such is the word that is used so seldom. There are things that a CGI unit can do to evoke such an effect: Grain filters, washed out colors, light blooming; that said, it doesn't necessarily work under the circumstances that most modern films are granted - or, perhaps, burdened - with. Johnston has an eye for these intangibles, not the least of which is dedicated to his work on both the Mummy and the Rocketeer, two completely safe and secure action films which helped to epitomize the 90's before bullet time dominated the scene.It is wholly pulp, characeristically old fashioned, and almost painfully short sighted, but that's where all of the charm seems to lie, anyway. More than anything, Chris Evans' work needs to be applauded. Drawing his own line between insecure empathy and a hoax patriotism of sorts, Evans works well with a role which would be seemingly inflexible, allowing the audience to witness a progression of maturity from what is, perhaps, the most iconic superhero of all. There really isn't much else to say about the performances: Weaving is a hopelessly evil sociopath with superhuman tendencies, Tommy Lee Jones offers some comic relief, and there's a love interest. As far as situational awareness presents itself, these are the basics.Plenty of this is complemented by a massive, exuberant atmosphere which evokes the majesty of the American 40's extremely well. This is most definitely where Johnston and company shine, and it's no surprise, given his extensive track record. Buildings are massive, explosions are pretty, and people die with dignity. It would be hard to call it anything other than pure family fodder if not for Evans' performance, which seems to be a vessel for others to observe and be inspired by. Chris Evans is a man who understands both the innocence and the responsibility of a ""rising"" Captain America, which is undeniably a vital component in establishing a proper atmosphere.The imposing, impressive badass will come later; for now, Captain America is a man limited to his very clean and admirable philosophies, and it's as good a film as any to stem into Whedon's magnificent epic, ""The Avengers!""",N/A

169188,"Rob Marshall`s ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"" doesn't have an ounce of gray in it. There's black, and white, bold, blood red, deep aqua blue and sunlight river gold. But no subtlety, no nuance. Wall-to-wall melodrama, it opens on a stormy night and closes on a blooming lagoon. It's a prestige picture succeeding in escapism and the enjoyment of watching catty, beautiful women prance around in thousand-dollar costumes.Geisha houses were popular in Japan for centuries through the 1950s; they still operate, I suppose, in their own way as escort services, though girls are no longer sold into the profession in elementary school and then trained for ten years before their virginity is sold to the highest-bidding client. It's formal prostitution, though Marshall and Co. would like us to think the long, long (long) smoldering affair between Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) and ""The Chairman"" (Ken Watanabe) is a kind of forbidden love.For years it doesn't seem Sayuri, born with sky blue eyes, will be anything more than janitor of her house, so manipulated she is by the house's best-earning geisha Hatsumomo (GongLi, excellent) a jealous vamp skilled in flirt and theft. Hatsumomo sizes up her much-younger housemate and decides Sayuri's friend, the clumsy Pumpkin (Youki Kudoh) will be easier to control.It isn't until a classier geisha named Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) recognizes Sayuri's beauty and potential talent that Sayuri is allowed to go to school, learn the art of sexual insinuation and eventually debut in a light-and-sound performance suitable for a high-class strip joint.  Through these formative years she must duel with Hatsumomo until the inevitable showdown, when House Mother (Kaori Momoi) must choose heir house heir and the vamp discovers the wunderkind's crush on The Chairman, who once treated Sayuri to a sno-cone.Does it sound trite? Oh, it's a soap opera.  But ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"" with its top-shelf production values, presents one visual flourish after another. Zhang and Yeoh, sensing larger access to Hollywood, deliver sincere performances. And there's a great villain in Gong Li, who at 40 must play a 22-year-old - and sneers and snorts her way to stealing the movie.But Hatsumomo exits the movie two-thirds of the way through and the movie must shift to Sayuri's trials through the end of World War II, the destruction of Japan, and eventual rebuilding, when the Chairman requests her service for a few American generals to help secure an industrial contract. Sayuri returns to her old station and finds her friend Pumpkin part of the arrangement, and different than Sayuri remembered.Maybe Marshall (""Chicago"") has directed the best movie he could about  geishas; maybe that's why Steven Spielberg dropped out to make the equally controversial, but far more substantive ""Munich."" Marshall certainly made the most commercial movie he could have, and DVD viewers - especially women in that ""Oprah"" season of life - may be surprised that a movie so smacked around by critics is also compulsively watchable. It's pure confection, sweet, empty, guilty, filled to the gut musical up swell and dramatic closeups. I doubt all this flies too close to mundane, emotionally cloaked lifestyle of a real geisha, and it doesn't completely succeed as a romantic picture because the love story engine peters out. Watanabe's character is so distant and vanilla that his relationship with Sayuri, whatever the resolution, lacks even an implicit passion to it. We're left to enjoy the catty duel between Hatsumomo and Sayuri in the movie's middle as Edith Wharton meets Quentin Tarantino.",N/A

Even though it &#34;loans&#34; from such archetypes as Amityville, The Exorcist and the Legend of Hell House (to name but a few). My general impression, though, is that some (perhaps significant) sequences are missing (or were cut for whatever reason in the editing room), and as a result there is a general feeling of dangling scenario avenues, of incoherence - it never becomes really frightening. This is particularly true for the ending: abrupt, lacking continuity and somewhat unsatisfying. An element that I found moderately irritating was the heavy reference to christinaty, even though no priest was actually involved. And another aggravation came from the non-use of the demonic doll, extensively shown in the pre-tiltes.",N/A

855717,"MOVIE: If you were to go to The American Film Institute's website you would see that the original Manchurian Candidate sits at number 67 for the best 100 movies in the last 100 years. The only question that strikes me here is why fix something if it's not broken? The original is a political thriller about the communism scare during the Cold War. The reason it's a classic is that the movie's plot delt with the possibilty that an outside evil could be controlling us, and the film also was telling the audience that communism is a government that will hypnotize you and your life, it was a message from the film makers. This new version uses the same idea of &quot;control&quot; except that instead of pointing at communism it's pointing at the idea that we live in a corrupt world, that our government is corrupt. Okay. . .I'm pretty sure that idea has been presented before, and in reality our government is corrupt in some ways and we know that. The movie does show us an almost fictional way of how the government is being controlled and that can raise questions like &quot;does the executive branch really have the most power or are they influenced enormously by others?&quot; While the answer to that question may be simple it also may be complex. The problem with the movie here is that the issues raised in the movie are way too fictional and far out to have any reference to our daily lives. Microchips implanted in our nation's leaders' brains is something that someone would say &quot;yeah right!&quot; to. The original delt with communism, a very real threat at the time. While the new modern version has the similar formula of the original movie, the main ingredient has been changed and the flavor just doesn't seem right.ACTING: This is a movie where if they had mediocre actors then the movie would have been considered an insult to John Frankenheimer. Denzel Washington gives a very convincing performance and it adds to the effect of the movie. Meryl Streep pulls off the role of the evil mother, but I still find Angela Lansbury's performance much better. The acting was top notch overall and all that emotion was needed to keep the audience entertained. Jonathan Demme also added to the tense atmosphere by using a lot of close-ups for character shots. Everytime an actor is delivering an emotional line the camera is always focused with the chin at the bottom of the screen and the top of the head at the top of the screen. This forces the audience to focus in the actors' eyes to really get the emotion, but just the fact of having to force emotion to the audience shows that remaking a classic wasn't easy.BOTTOM LINE: What if someone said that Hollywood was going to remake Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, or Ben-Hur . . . exactly! This modern version is no match for the original classic, and even though the original may have lost its touch due to the passing of communistic fears it still holds the values that make it way better than this modern tale.",The Manchurian Candidate

1128909,"You'd think that at least one vampire would wise up and take advantage of the fact that Alaska spends many a day in the dark.  As far as I am aware, no such fate has befallen the great northern state.  Based on the comic miniseries of the same name, ""30 Days of Night"" gives us a good look at what might happen if a vampire and a few of his undead friends would sink their fangs into the Land of the Midnight Sun.The film opens with the small town of Barrow, Alaska preparing for its month-long dive into darkness (hence the thirty days of night).  Most of the town's citizens are heading for sunnier locations, but a select few stay behind and stick it out.  In this small group is the local sheriff, Eben (Josh Hartnett).  While everyone is getting ready to leave, he's busy investigating a number of strange criminal acts (burning of cellular phones, slaughtering sled dogs, etc.).  As he digs deeper into his investigation, he arrests a stranger (Ben Foster) who begins to wax prophetic about someone or something coming and that no one will survive.Also staying behind (due to missing her flight) is Eben's estranged wife Stella (Melissa George).  She assists Eben in arresting the stranger and goes with the pair to the sheriff's station where Eben's grandmother and brother are.As soon as the sun goes down, chaos reigns supreme.  Eben goes to check on the local telephone office and discovers a brutal murder/decapitation.  Scared, he heads back to town and warns those that stayed behind to hide in their homes.  As it gets darker, more and more people begin to die.  Soon the streets are filled with blood and snow as a gang of vampires feast on the townsfolk.A few survivors of the initial attack (including Eben and Stella) hole up in an attic and make plans to survive for the next month.  The rest of the film shows the small group attempting to stay alive by using their knowledge of the town and the brutal snowfall to their advantage.  Along the way, a few other survivors are picked apart by the vampire group which is headed up by Marlowe (Danny Huston).As supplies become scarce and time begins to wear on them, the survivors take more and more chances in order to stay alive.  This leads up to an eventual standoff with the vampires.  Who lives?  Who dies?  Who finally gets to see the rising sun?  Watch ""30 Days of Night"" and you'll find out.The film's premise is great.  It takes a legendary creature and puts in the one place that gives it seemingly every advantage over its victims.  Isolated, cold, and in complete darkness, the average human would find it hard to survive with limited resources in such environs.  Throw in a gaggle of bloodsucking immortals and you've really got problems.The film's special effects are very good as well.  They are bloody, gory, and very realistic.  The makeup department also did a very good job.Josh Hartnett's portrayal of Eben was very believable.  Unlike the untouchable heroes in many films, he reacts to the initial vampire attacks with fear and confusion.  I actually felt for his character as he tried to make sense of his situation.  Melissa George is fairly convincing in her role as well.  Mark Boone Junior nearly steals the show as Beau Brower, an unlikely hero in the film.Unfortunately, Steve Niles and Stuart Beattie's story drags along at times and lacks a really convincing enemy.  Despite being the leader of the vampire gang and seemingly full of wisdom, Marlowe just isn't that scary.  There's never a moment in this film where I looked at Danny Huston's character and thought, ""There's no way they can stop this guy.""  Whether it was Huston's performance or the direction of Huston by David Slade, I felt that the weak villain was the film's greatest downfall.Despite this, I still recommend ""30 Days of Night.""  While it isn't the best vampire film out there, it is much more loyal to its wicked origins than many of today's modern vampires.  In a time where most bloodsuckers are busy courting teen girls or hanging out at Fangtasia, it's nice to see some truly evil vampires make their way out of the darkness.",N/A

The problem here is in the first 2 films viewers watched Rocky as a hungry fighter going the distance, twice, and beating the odds, while, in this film it just seems like a been there, done that attitude blankets the film.It does suck to see Rocky lose it all & move back into a place that he thought he would never have to go back to.The fight at the end is o.k., at best (again, I would rate it dead last in the saga, as far as the fights go). When I first realized this was the big fight of the movie, it really was a dissapointment (no training montage?! no ""eye of the tiger""!?!)""Rocky V"" is a decent enough movie, but, I always thought the saga should've gone out with a bang, than a whimper.As for ""Rocky VI"", its highly likely that it will ever hit the big screen (""V"" was released 15 years ago).

Its been roughly five years since the death of Adrian, Paulie finally gets a girlfriend and moves in with her, Rocky Jr. has grown up & become a busy businessman & for the first time in a long while Rocky is all alone. But, when the current heavyweight champ is dissed on a ESPN style cableshow, in which a daily feature has a current sportstar going up against a sportslegend of the same sport (its all CGI & computer enhanced), in this case, he went up against Rocky & lost badly, he calls Rocky out of retirement to see if he still has The Eye Of The Tiger.Not bad.

774128,"""Eight Crazy Nights"" is like an animated holiday special as it might be envisioned and conceived by the Farrelly Brothers - rude, crude, vulgar, yet surprisingly conformist in its values and themes.The people actually responsible for the film are director Seth Kearsley, and writers Brooks Arthur, Allen Covert, Brad Isaacs and Adam Sandler.  Sandler also provides the voice for the lead character, Davey Stone, a 30-something curmudgeon who hates the holidays and goes out of his way to ruin them for everyone else.  As a public menace, Davey finds himself assigned by court order to assist a sweet, but addled septuagenarian who coaches a youth basketball team.Part of the fun of ""Eight Crazy Nights"" comes from the strange dichotomy between the film's crude humor and the picture postcard small town setting.  This film looks like every Christmas special ever made, yet when the characters open their mouths...well, all I can say is that ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" or ""Frosty the Snowman"" this ain't.

But the film is really no worse in tone than the average Sandler comedy and the humor is nothing that every prepubescent boy hasn't heard or even indulged in himself (though the scatological sequences involving some deer are a bit much).  In fact, one of the criticisms that can be leveled against the film is that it really isn't raunchy enough, that it wants to have it both ways.  It wants to come across as a daring and iconoclastic image-buster, yet it can't resist employing the very same heart tugs that virtually all other holiday films employ and which this film is supposed to be a reaction against.  Unlike, say, ""South Park,"" which makes no concessions to sentimentality, ""Eight Crazy Nights"" loses its nerve and becomes just another warm-hearted and cuddly holiday-themed film at the end.  That's too bad because we really could use a corrosive tonic long about this time of the year.  After all who decreed that all holiday films had to be pure sweetness and light?  Isn't running over grandma with a reindeer also a holiday tradition?Still, ""Eight Crazy Nights"" does have some very shrewd, very clever, very funny moments contained within it, enough to almost compensate for the conventional gooey ending - and it does a nice job parodying the musical interludes generally found in more conventional Disney-type animated features as well.  Moreover, ""Eight Crazy Nights"" has historical significance in that it is the first movie I can remember in which Chanukah achieves equal billing with Christmas.  That's a long overdue correction, I must say, although I'm just not sure that Jewish mothers quite had this in mind when they envisioned it finally happening.  Oy vay!",N/A
1215777,"I found this western watchable, but absolutely nothing more and couple of hours after seeing it I already couldn't remember some details... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In 1882 the town of Appaloosa, New Mexico, is ruled by a local cattle-baron named Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who doesn't hesitate to kill those who oppose him. The people of the town hire then a wandering lawman (a ""town-tamer"") named Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his deputy, Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), to end Bragg's reign of terror... It will not be easy, as Bragg has many cards to play, including but not limited to evil henchmen like Ring Shelton (Lance Henriksen). At one moment also a ""femme fatale"" (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) will appear and try to drive a wedge between Cole and Hitch.This is not a bad film, but it is somehow... banal. The scenario is not very good and dialogs are really lame, with a grand total of ONE good one-liner in a 115 minutes movie... Also shootouts are not very good - don't expect any brilliant action scenes. Soundtrack could as well be absent - nothing here that can be measured against some old western music...The only reason why this film is even watchable is the cast which is indeed stellar: Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Jeremy Irons (who clearly had the time of his life playing a bad guy in a western!) and Lance Henriksen are always a pleasure to watch, in anything. As for Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, well, I didn't like her much in this film, mostly because I never was a fan of her, in fact quite the contrary - and also here her character is also unpleasant and annoying...Some people suggested that this film is a kind of very distant remake of 1959 ""Warlock"" with Henry Fonda and Anthony Quinn, but I strongly disagree with that. Not even mentioning many other differences, the crucial point is that in ""Warlock"" it was clear that one of ""town-tamers"" (played by Anthony Quinn) was a closeted homosexual totally in love with his boss (played by Henry Fonda). No such thing is perceptible here.Bottom line, this is a film slightly disappointing and rather banal, but still watchable, mostly for the performance of the four main male actors. It is just a pity that dialogs and action scenes are so LAME - with just a little more effort it could have been a really solid, good western. Recommended for renting rather than buying.",N/A

1140067,"Coming across as the unholy union of Ghost in the Shell and Dune, Vexille is one of several recent CGI-based animated movies from Japan (think Appleseed).  Following a US special robot forces operative on a mission to infiltrate an isolated, heavily-roboticized Japan in 2077, Vexille is an unapologetically action-oriented movie.  Do not expect deep characterization or witty dialogue--this movie has neither.  Nor is it--despite the obvious influence of Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed, and other Masamune Shirow works--a true cyberpunk film, as there is virtually no computer hacking (and none by the main character).Although the underlying theme of the dangers of runaway technology is common in science fiction, the simple beauty in which the consequences of Japan's actions are revealed is the best-executed moment in the movie.  Unfortunately, this high point comes far too early, meaning the plot is left to meander toward only a modest payoff (and even that only after some awkward moments which seem to belong to some other movie).Technically, Vexille uses a cel-shading technique, in which the computer-generated actors are intended to look as if they were traditional anime characters.  The effect is so-so here; the technique has been around long enough that it doesn't really stand out on its own and it is not used to any particular effect here--Vexille could just as easily have been a traditional anime.  In addition, some of the slower bits--e.g., climbing stairs--look unnatural.  On the audio side, the English dub (which is what I watched) is executed well-enough and consistent with Funimation's standards, but neither the script nor the animation really reveals much of these characters.  Only Vexille herself and the other main female character, Maria, stand out in the English dub.Ultimately, Vexille lacks the punch to really grab a viewer.  It is certainly watchable and has its moments, but it never exceeds the sum of its parts--and a few of those parts never really belonged.",Vexille - Movie

361236,"I think that ""Bleu"" has failed in what most more or less watchable films made in the 90s have failed. While it is beautifully shot, has a good casting, an appropriate musical score, and a number of highly original (and therefore interesting) scenes (where the use of music, the use of silence is very effective), on the whole it is rather pointless and thus boring. While watching it, I could not understand why it should have been called ""Bleu"". This story about a woman who survives a tragedy and has to struggle with her past (and present) is at times very delicate and realistic - and these scenes do come up in my mind from time to time - but it is shown in a way too limited in scope; the film on the whole does not remain in your mind for long, it lacks some strength, some backbone.

Troubled kid, shown clearly and without argument to be a troubled kid.  He has a major tantrum, acts out poorly, bites his mom when she tries to corral him, and then runs off into the night.  He runs into the woods, sets sail on a boat to a land far away, populated by monsters.Monsters opt to make him their king instead of eat him.  His reign as king starts out well, and steadily declines.He realizes he's just a boy, not a king, not equipped to make decisions, not someone who should be in charge, and sails home.  He gets home, and his mom gives him cake.Fade to black.Visually:  As I stated above, stunning.  Not just landscapes on the island, which were gorgeous, but early scenes as well.  The disjointed and chaotic feel of the snowball fight between Max and his older sister's friends, sucks you in.You FEEL how being outnumbered and having your snow fort come down around you can be very scary. Innocent kid fun CAN turn scary in an instant, and this scene was particularly effective.Same with the dirt clod fight.  A relatively innocent incident becomes beautiful and chaotic and frightening in a moment, and the violence sways back and forth between being funny and being scary.A final, lesser example, is the dog pile scene.  Max feels secure and safe in a pile of monsters, but as they continue to pile on, you realize he might just get crushed, and his safe security has a bit of a dark side to it all of the sudden.So, a beautiful movie with a thin plot.  It needs strong characters to make it work.We don't really get those, either.This movie calls upon a small boy to carry it on his shoulders.  He does a commendable job, but when his supporting cast is a bunch of dysfunctional monsters, there's only so much we can hope for.I was bored 20 minutes in, though occasionally finding myself in awe of what I was watching, for most of the rest of it.Movie gets three stars because of a random series of moments within the film.Some of the one on one interactions between Max and the two main monsters were touching.For example the scene in the cave, when Carol shows max his model city.I also tended to enjoy the scenes with Max and KW.And there as was the one scene before he sets sail, where he makes up a story to entertain his mom, between bouts of out of control, destructive behaviour.  These brief moments really touched me, and stood out in a mostly boring, but beautiful, movie.",Where the Wild Things Are

But the film became watchable as the child characters became more prominent, bringing humor and interesting personalities to a story whose lead characters generate no interest whatsoever. You would have to like Christine and Richard to like the film, and they fell completely flat for me. But the kids are its saving grace. Brandon Ratcliffe as Robbie is especially natural and charming. Miranda July, who wrote and directed the film as well as stars in it, takes an intelligent, respectful approach to children, which I think is the film's strength.

This documentary from Sam Dunn, Scot McFadyen, and Jessica Joy Wise posits itself as an anthropological study of Heavy Metal culture and its perceptions. Narrated and starring Dunn, the film traces the roots of Metal (Black Sabbath) and explores several of the modern subgenres (Cannibal Corpse). Dunn travels far and wide to interview idols, stars, and various ""expert voices"" to provide an interesting, albeit cursory, look at Metal and its various incarnations.With scraggly hair, ratty goatee, and immense collection of band t-shirts, Dunn is anything but a novice on the subject.

878139,"The majority of American Laurel & Hardy fans have first seen this feature in a grainy copy of a 55-minute American release that Blackhawk sold for years. When first released, the Hal Roach Studios was releasing alternate editions of their comedies to the foreign markets, usually in longer versions, with the stars themselves speaking the translated dialogue. Historians have found evidence of at least four or five variants of ""Pardon Us,"" including an extended version of ""Pardon Us"" that is the content of this DVD release. This appears to be the British release version with the American titles retained (in Britain this was ""Gaol Birds"").In terms of structure, longer is not necessarily better. The movie is still what Laurel called a ""3-story building on a 1-story foundation."" It seems like three short subjects strung together with an arbitrary climax tossed into the final 10 minutes to wrap things up. However, many scenes in this release are longer, particularly the middle sequence on the cotton farm. The added minutes help the individual scenes, relieving the choppiness that has always seemed characteristic of this feature. And while the cotton farm scene slows the feature to a halt, the singing of the Etude Ethiopian Chorus, coupled with Stan & Ollie's song and dance routines, are a pleasant diversion, in spite of the dated imagery.The overall pictoral quality on this release is about a 1000% improvement over the film prints I grew up with, but apart from the overall quality of the feature, for which I'm grateful, this disk is very lean. There are no chapter stops, no chapters of publicity material, no chapters of alternate scenes, some of which still exist. It would have been instructive to have the leaner American release on this or a second disk for sake of comparison. But like too many other American releases of Laurel & Hardy (and Little Rascals) comedies, we're getting the bare bones and little else.But for the Laurel & Hardy fan, this movie is essential viewing.

841543,"Generally speaking, the Universal Legacy Collection volumes tend to feature one immensely well done film and a mixed bag of sequels.  The Mummy Legacy Collection is unique, however, both because the first film is not part of the same franchise as the four films that follow and because the quality in nearly all of these films is sub-par when compared to the usual Universal Monster standard.  With the exception of one severely underrated sequel in this volume (""The Mummy's Ghost""), I consider these to be mediocre films, most feeling like B films shot on A film budgets.The Mummy **: What should have been an amazing film is repeatedly compromised by its direction and its studio.  Karl Freund, the cinematographer legend who revolutionized the look of both cinema and television, was drafted to direct this film at the very last second.  Freund had never directed a film in his life, and that comes across clearly.  While the film is filled with lavish sets and strong visuals (Karloff's intense close-ups with his burning eyes are nothing less than iconic), it fails to take any stance on the story, itself.  The Mummy is motivated by intense love, and yet Karloff's acting and Freund's cameras do not sympathize with him.  At the same time, if The Mummy is not the protagonist with whom we side, who is?  The professor's obnoxious, lazy, and impulsive son?  We're left with a less than terrifying film about a somewhat creepy looking lover/killer who is neither a monster nor the tragic figure with whom we sympathize.  Freund applies no level of pathos to the script, nor does he compel it from Karloff.  Instead, we get an indecisive, yet beautiful looking film that never really works on the emotions in the way that it should.  Perhaps, had the studio not cut a sequence in which we see Karloff's character follow his lover across various time-periods, each time failing to keep her, the film would resonate differently.  Instead, as it stands, The Mummy fails to capture the terror of Dracula nor the tragic pathos of Frankenstein.  It falls carelessly between the two, never really delivering anything more than a memorable set of burning eyes.  Oh, and I'd be amiss to leave out the fact that Karloff ceases to appear as a mummy after the first scene of the film.  A disappointment all around.The Mummy's Hand ***: Eight years later, The Mummy franchise resets itself with a far simpler, more action-oriented monster flick with a similar (yet different) mummy (who actually appears as a mummy throughout the film), a simple yet likable band of heroes, a new and more imaginative set of rules surrounding the Mummy mythos, and a plot that holds together reasonably well if you give it a healthy suspension of disbelief.  Don't approach this film looking for artistry of any kind.  It's a great B horror film; nothing more and nothing less.The Mummy's Tomb **: The first sequel to The Mummy's Hand fast forwards many years and features geriatric versions of the previous film's protagonists, as well as a boring son who looks like Basil Rathbone but lacks his acting skills, and an Egyptian priest villain who is blatantly Japanese to suit the anti-Japan hysteria of post-Pearl Harbor America.  If this sounds like a recipe for a lame sequel, you're not entirely wrong.  The only saving grace is Lon Chaney Jr., who really defines the morbid and deformed presence of the mummy.  The film's watchable, but it's hardly entertaining.The Mummy's Ghost *****: Here's where the franchise offers up a tremendous surprise.  The second sequel to The Mummy's Hand borrows the strongest ingredients from the previous films and then takes the franchise to the next level.  We actually see Kharis (the Mummy) finally begin to take on true characterization.  With even more limitations placed upon him than Karloff's Frankenstein monster (can't talk, and you can barely see any facial expressions beneath those bandages), we can still see Chaney's Mummy experience frustration, rage, love, and resolute sadness.  Add to this John Carradine playing the best villain of the entire series (think Christopher Lee meets Willam Defoe meets Peter Lorre), likable characters, and one draw-dropping surprise ending, and you're in for one heck of a viewing experience.  I honestly don't understand how this film gets overlooked by classic horror fans.The Mummy's Curse *: The worst of the series, in my humble opinion.  The characters are woefully under-developed, there's almost no plot and certainly no recognizable protagonists until the last twenty minutes of the film, there are massive plot holes, and the resolution is entirely unsatisfying.  This is a film that simply didn't need to be made.  Perhaps its one saving grace is that we finally get a Mummy film where the evil priest doesn't spontaneously fall in love and thereby undo himself at the end of the film.All in all, this is one sleeper of a franchise with a few minor exceptions:- You get the first mediocre film, featuring Karloff, some beautiful visuals, and a premise that could have been amazing if given to another director.- The second film is fun, if cheesy.- The fourth film is a true masterpiece and absolutely worth seeing on its own.One great film, one almost great film, two B films, and a severely disappointing final entry.  It's a mixed bag, to say the least, but It's still worth a viewing if you have the cash to burn.",N/A
731262,"`Learn the startling answer in this expertly crafted thriller from director Peter Rader (co-writer of Waterworld).'  This is part of the editorial review listed on Amazon for the film Grandmother's House aka Grandma's House (1988).  If this was meant as an enticement, it didn't work, as I saw Waterworld, and I didn't think it was all that great...maybe it had something to do with a man (or mutant, as the case may be) drinking his own wiz...I think Kevin Costner should have to enjoy a cup of his own urinations for each person subjected to his vanity projects...but I digress...this review is for the Image Entertainment release of the film, which lists the title as Grandmother's House and claims to be the 2003 version...there was a previous DVD release of this film titled Grandma's House, and it's essentially the same film with a few differences (I'll explain more later).The film, directed by Peter Rader (Hired to Kill), stars Eric Foster (Death House) and Kim Valentine (.com for Murder) as recently orphaned siblings David and Lynn, respectively, who are sent to live with their grandparents, played by Len `Uncle Leo' Lesser (Seinfeld, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Kelly's Heroes) and Ida Lee (It Runs in the Family).  Also appearing is scream queen and B movie fav Brinke Stevens (Repligator, Horrorvision, Mark of the Astro-Zombies).  The film starts out with a funeral, as Eric and Lynn are paying respects to their recently deceased father (apparently, their mother passed sometime earlier).  How did he die?  Don't know, don't care, doesn't matter...after arriving at their grandparent's orange farm in California (southern California, by the look), things seem all right at first, but the appearance of a rather scary looking woman (Stevens) heralds a world of trouble as David and Lynn discover every family has skeletons in their closet, and some literally...(okay, there are no skeletons in this film, but I thought it sounded kinda cool).Despite many flaws, I found much to like about this film, even though, based on the title, I was expecting something a little different (I thought it might have been a modern retelling of the story of Little Red Riding Hood).  So what was wrong with the film?  Well, for starters, the script seemed half-baked, and I don't mean that in the way one would describe someone who uses the Maui Wowie, but in terms of not being fully realized.  At times it did work, but then other times it seemed, well, lacking substance, not feeling very realistic....and this wasn't helped by often weak performances.  Most of the main actors did well, about as well as you'd expect for this kind of film, but the secondary players tended to stink to the point where they really stood out.  This is painfully illustrated by two specific performances, one by Furley Lumpkin (seriously, that's his real name) who played an off duty deputy, and Michael Robinson, who played Lynn's overly amorous love interest Kenny.  A side note...did anyone else find it a lot creepy that Kenny, who was clearly in his mid 20's, should have such an infatuation with Lynn, a girl who seemed to be between the ages of 15 and 17?  His definition of a date subsisted of thinly veiled innuendoes and a whole lot of groping...ick...the plot got bogged down a few times as it tried to develop a sense of danger where there really wasn't any, similar to a shoddy mystery that pushes the `red herrings' too hard (the scene where the shotgun toting grandfather is searching the house for David comes to mind...it was shot well, and created a good amount of edginess, but ultimately led nowhere).  Another thing that kind of bothered me, and I see this a lot in horror films, involves the antagonistic character played by Brinke Stevens, who was pretty effective, even though she didn't have much dialogue.  Often she would move throughout the film, magically appearing here and there with relative ease...I would have thought she was twins, or even triplets, the way she got around.  So what was good about the film?  Well, for the most part the story held up well (the relevant parts), and the director did better than I would have expected in creating tension, avoiding a lot of cheap tactics (pop out scares and such), cultivating the suspense and keeping me interested (he was also helped by genuinely decent musical score).  Most of the film took place in the large farmhouse and the surrounding grove, both of which were used well.  As I said before, the main actors did pretty well (I did get annoyed with Eric Foster rather quickly, I suppose mainly because he sported a `flock of seagulls' haircut throughout nearly the entire film).  I liked the twists and turns in the plot, but that last one seemed to come out of nowhere, and there wasn't really anything to support it within the film (unless I missed it).  All in all I'd say this is a pretty watchable film, better than most in its' class, and worth a look if you're interested in a eerie little thriller with more scares than blood.This release from Image Entertainment is labeled the 2003 version, and claims to have restored audio and video elements.  The wide screen (1:85.1) anamorphic picture does look pretty good, but there are a few, minor flaws (nothing to get upset about).  The DVD boasts five different audio channels in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround for English, French, German and Italian, along with Dolby Digital 2.0 in English.  Special features include a featurette titled `The Films of Nico Mastorakis, Part II' (he's the producer, and I am unsure where part I is located), a theatrical trailer, filmographies and biographies.  One thing I learned from this film is when running through an orange grove, it's better to keep your eyes focused in front of you than behind...as I'm sure David would agree...ouch...Cookieman108",N/A

640588,"This version has its merits.  The scenery is terrific, and the one scene in the morning mist with the sun rising is incomparably beautiful.  Mary and Anne de Bourgh are treated more sympathetically than in the BBC miniseries' version, and Jane and Wickham are very good-looking (as they're written in the novel).  Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is good.The two-hour time frame makes it difficult to develop the story very much, so basically everything that isn't Lizzy-Darcy is truncated (Lizzy-Jane, Lizzy-Mr. Bennet relationship, even Lydia and Wickham is shortened).  Some of the period stuff (another reviewer mentioned the bedroom visits, and the costuming) is a little off.  But these aren't major problems, at least for me.My main issue with it is that it feels like a twenty-first century version of the story.  It is more angsty, and it takes a very modern young person view of Lizzy and Darcy--that is, it has them behave emotionally more like us moderns would at their ages rather than the Lizzy and Darcy of the novel and of two centuries ago.  It's got a twinge of the WB teenage drama in it.The cleverness and the wit of Austen's work are minimal here, and it feels more somber.  Mr. Bennet's ""sarcastic humor"" is gone; his lines are delivered seriously.  Mr. Collins' servility and Mrs. Bennet's nerves and silliness are much toned down from their BBC versions, making the characters more personable, but it feels just a little less.  (Less amusing, for sure.)I had trouble caring for this movie's Lizzy and Darcy.  Austen's Elizabeth had an easy playfulness and a quickness about her.  This Elizabeth has lost most of her witty humor (albeit fitting of the more serious tone of the movie) and thus comes across a little shrill, without the lively charm to cover for her more ""insolent"" moments.She is emotional and flighty, swinging from smiling and giggly to crying hard, to yelling (raising her voice) at Darcy during the first proposal--which seems a little weird for the restrained manners of that time period.  This Elizabeth feels more like a modern, fiery teenager than the proper, confident but lively novel heroine.Darcy, here, instead of being proud, just comes across as sad.  He has sad puppy dog eyes the entire movie.  To me, it makes Lizzy's rejection seem a lot harsher.  Even the end scene (for American audiences?) didn't make me like them any more--it just felt hokey instead.The novel has Lizzy and Darcy as equals in intellect and in faults--Lizzy to drop her prejudice and Darcy to learn to change his pride.  In this movie version, Lizzy just comes around to where Darcy is; he doesn't change.As a movie taken by itself, not bad, and a fast way to acquaint onself with the basic storyline.  To see a much truer version of the novel, though, watch the 1995/1996 BBC/A&E; miniseries with Ehle and Firth.",N/A
1066488,"One of the characters in ""The Good German"" remarks that the best champagne has the smallest bubbles. The film unfortunately, has a few big bubbles that impress initially, but vaporize and leave a flat, bitter fluid later.The big bubbles are the name actors and homage to film noir. The overweaning style, heightened by the best component of the film (Thomas Newman's music) is intriguing to lovers of the genre, but the actors, professional as they are, can't bring much to their roles, probably as a result of the direction. Clooney is likeable as always but doesn't project the necessary intensity of caring for Cate Blanchett that the action demands. Blanchett does create a character, but it's too Dietrich-like to stand in its own right. So, after the plot ends and the actors leave the screen, you're left with disappointment, even though your hopes were up and you were saying to yourself, ""This film isn't as bad as they were claiming!""The bottom line for me is: the real comparison film is Lars Von Trier's ""Zentropa"" (or ""Europa"") of 1991. That film has 10 times more noir techniques of interest, and a stronger symbolic element that makes the necessity of characterization less important.

311315,"The Maysles' brothers had film rolling in 1969 on the Rolling Stones' American tour and we are left with a little snapshot of time, a window to the groaning disillusioned close to the hippie counterculture.I had high hopes with ""The Rolling Stones--Gimme Shelter,"" as most reviewers touted it as one of the greatest statements on Rock and Roll and certainly one of the best music films around.  After watching it, I'm not sure that I'd agree.  If you are a Stones'-Head, I can certainly see the allure.  I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan myself and I admit a similarly subjected documentary made about that band would leave me pulling out my wallet dialing up Amazon and making an advance purchase.  So if you fall into the category of ascribing to Mick, Keith, and the boys rock and roll demagogy, well, you probably are convinced that ""Gimme Shelter,"" is the greatest thing since sliced toast.  The movie is fragmented.  At the beginning we get this ringside seat of the Stones' tour, music-making, and dare I say, boring goings-on.  Yes, the Rolling Stones, one of the 60's, 70's, and 80's more storied wild rock n roll band...boring.  This documentary actually captures the band as such until Altamont that is.  At Altamont the documentary takes a turn and things get interesting.Wherever you are with the 60's counterculture free-love, free-spirit debate as to the value of its role on our cultural development, this documentary seems to come across tangentially as a statement on all that.  The boomers, the generation, that fervently stood up for world peace, free-love, communal living, getting together had some wonderful idealistic ideas.  So, famous boomers, the generation that produced both Bill Clinton and George Bush, Jr., also include Mick Jagger and Keith Richards...not to mention dear Charlie Watts.  Altamont though sees the counterculture exposed.  The bookend of the big festivals, Woodstock and Altamont are pretty diametrically opposed.  One worked and one tragically didn't.What we get from ""Gimme Shelter,"" is a statement that along with an idealistic approach to life needs to accompany a healthy dose of responsibility, accountability, and the need for organization.  You can't say you have general good-will towards humanity without taking responsible action to ensure that the human condition exists in a safe semi-ordered world.  That is reading entirely too much into ""Gimme Shelter,"" I know but as the concert organizers go through the parking plan of trying to accommodate tens of thousands of cars in space that won't accommodate all those cars, we get a window on an enlightened and funny scene.  One of the concert organizers at the event is trying to help with the parking situation and eventually just says...yeah man we are letting them park wherever, it's kind of like an experiment.  Hah...an experiment which leads into a far more serious 'experiment' the California Hell's Angels being in charge of security.The stage becomes unsafe as people press in from all sides on The Burrito Brothers, Jefferson Airplane, and the Stones.  Jefferson Airplane's lead singer even gets beat up by the Hells Angels, yeah that's right, the guys hired to protect them.  The Grateful Dead refuses to go on (smart guy that Jerry Garcia) and we eventually get to the chaos that kills a man, Meredith Hunter.  Mick tries to take some responsibility and attempts to lead the crowd and the Angels in a ""let's get together,"" plea reminiscent of Rodney King's ""can't we all just get along.""  So we see the band's reaction to reviewing the concert footage and can actually see the Hell's Angels' knife-welding member slashing down on Hunter and Jagger walks away numb.  Incredulously music is played after the incident and the show goes on.  There has been no solution really to the masses going haywire at Rock-N-Roll concerts...from the Who's stampede to PJ's Roskilde...safety and security in the midst of celebrations and in the midst of rock-n-roll rebellion is still an issue to be addressed.So on this MLK day 2007, there is nothing wrong with the concepts behind loving your fellow man, world peace, and all that 60's stuff.  MLK stood up for it and stood up for it with responsibility and accountability.  Altamont didn't have that.  Culturally, where are we going now in this time of GWOT and Brittney Spears?  The show must go on and the Stones still geriatrically rock.  The best rock-umentary of all times...Gimme Shelter...in my opinion probably not.  Check out ""Dig,"" for a really excellent updated statement on rock and roll.  If you are a fan of the Stones or just a fan of music history, watch Gimme Shelter.  If not I don't think you will get no satisfaction.--MMW",N/A
16105,"I thought I was going to enjoy this film, when I saw that Bruce Willis was looking mighty fine on the cover, but when I started watching it, the only thing I was really watching it for Bruce Willis. The storyline was quite interesting, but the rest of the characters just weren't.Andie MacDowell, for some reason, I just don't like. Hudson Hawk was released in 1991, and 13 years on, she looks the exact same. In the continuous rubbish commercials that she puts out, when it's perfectly obvious she's using something a lot stronger than skin firming cream. Give me a break.I quite liked the appearance by Richard E Grant in this, and I would have much preferred him by himself, until that thing came along, and over-acted and over exaggerated her way into the bad acting world. So much so that I can't bear to mention her name. If Richard had been by himself, it would have been so much better.I normally like Bruce Willis films, but in this, he seemed to be constantly winking at the camera - and you say the cast of Friends were bad at this?! And he's ruined forever for me by singing. It wouldn't have been so bad, if he hadn't sung it so overly camp, and done all these stupid moves (no one say a word about Steps) Sure sometimes, he may come across as funny, but if you're used to seeing him in so much better films, then you'll probably be on my side.Most of the time, the film can't decide what it wants to be - a parody full of puns, or a true to heart action movie. Igg & Ook are just like the twins in the Matrix movies, only better. There are some extremely stupid and unbelieveable scenes, one being 'Hawk' falling out of the sky, bouncing off a street light and landing in a chair in the cafe at the exact time he's supposed to meet a woman?! That wouldn't happen.I suppose this should have been a film that makes you laugh, and notice all the little in jokes (like Sylvester Stallone's brother, which totally went over my head), or try and figure out what Igg & Ook's last words were, when they don't actually speak. And of course you've got that thing in it. Take out that, make Bruce Willis not sing, and the film might have been slightly better.

667208,"This beautifully filmed movie is an adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel by the same name. The sets/locations are gorgeous, and the acting quite adequate.The story concerns the mental disintegration of a chess master, Luzhin. He is portrayed as a kind and sincere person, though perhaps too nave. As the story progresses Luzhin becomes involved in a critical chess match. The stresses prove too much, leading to his mental breakdown and destruction.Those who have not read Nabokov's novel will probably find the film both entertaining and enlightening, as well as a glimpse into the world of professional chess.But those who have read Nabokov's novel might be disappointed. For the movie simplifies too much. Nabokov had a talent for providing a comic touch to essentially very dark subjects. The movie takes a different approach: it lightens the topic by concentrating all evil into a single character, an unscrupulous trainer/agent. This produces two-dimensional  cardboard characters.Nabokov's book explores the deeper question whether total immersion into abstract mental activities might be deleterious to the human psyche.  A neglected child, Luzhin immersed himself in the rational and secure world of chess. Was the withrawal from the world of social interaction the root cause of Luzhin's problems -- or was there a deeper reason yet?The writer G. K. Chesterton conjectured that:""Poets do not go mad; but chess-players do. Mathematicians go mad, and cashiers; but creative artists very seldom. I am not, as will be seen, in any sense attacking logic: I only say that this danger does lie in logic, not in imagination.

WAY over the top!When anything is possible, (as it is with CGI) there is no wow factor left -- That leaves only acting and writing to depend on, which leaves this film needing work -- perhaps a complete re-write and re-filming by a better team?If nothing else, 'Man of Steel' is a huge improvement over the &#34;boy of fluff&#34;  that 'Superman Returns' gave us in 2006 -- But, this one  lacks the warmth, heart, soul and  humor of earlier portrayals. It never really figures out where it's at, where it comes from or even where it's going. The opening sequence sure looks like a direct rip from the 1989 batman movie --  After that, interesting as it may be, I couldn't help but think how right at home Batman would feel on Krypton  - it doesn't look all that different from an over-sized &#34;Vulcan Batcave&#34;, ( the Krypton Elders outfits look like something out of Star Trek ).

1188310,"All right, I'll admit it.  I saw this movie on opening weekend.  I will now attempt to review it while also attempting to steer clear of political commentary.  I seldom like to read unabashed commentary from others, and I don't want them to read much of mine!In case you don't know, this film, from AIRPLANE creator David Zucker, is a conservative-made spoof of, for lack of a better word, the liberal mindset or point-of-view.  It is very much in the style of AIRPLANE type movies, but from a humor standpoint, it falls a little more into the SCARY MOVIE level of success.  There are plenty of laughs and plenty of clunkers.  If you don't like these kinds of movies, with rapid-fire jokes, low comedy and nonsensical plots...just steer clear.It tells the story of a Michael Moore-like filmmaker (played by Chris Farley's younger brother Kevin), who has grown to hate America so much that he's actually campaigning to abolish the 4th of July!  He is then visited by three ""ghosts"" (mostly General Patton, but also briefly by George Washington and the Angel of Death), who show him past events in American history and his own life that cause him to rethink his attitudes towards the US.  (In case you hadn't guessed from this description or the title...the premise is a loosey-goosey gloss on A CHRISTMAS CAROL.)The film DOES have some very funny moments.  There is a hilarious bit with Rosie O'Connell (NOT Rosie O'Donnell), a shrill America-hater who happens to look like Rosie O'Donnell (see, the ""humor"" isn't always very subtle)...who screens for Bill O'Reilly (the REAL Bill O'Reilly, playing himself, just like he does in real life) a ""documentary"" she has made showing that we shouldn't be profiling Arab-appearing persons in security lines at airports because there is a ""vast Christian-fundamentalist terrorist conspiracy"" out there.  It's a heavy-handed bit...but it also does a nice job of reminding us just what types of people HAVE actually attacked our country, and that frisking old, white American grannies just to appear NOT to be profiling might be a waste of time.  But politics aside, the bit is just plain funny.There are running gags about Michael Moore...whoops, I mean Michael Malone...receiving no real respect as a documentarian.  (""I have an Oscar!""  ""Yeah, for documentaries."")  These are pretty funny, and provide the main plot impetus...terrorists are trying to recruit Malone to make a ""real"" movie, rather than a documentary, about how great the Taliban and its ilk are.  Malone is actually mightily tempted.Kelsey Grammer plays Patton, and he's pretty much exactly what you'd expect.  Farley doesn't exactly rise to Oscar level with his performance, but if anyone will get a ""bounce"" from this film, it may be him.  He's a nice presence on the screen, and I think might do well with a subtler role.  Other appearances come from folks like Robert Davi and Dennis Hopper (it's fun to see which familiar actors have aligned themselves with the conservative side).  And naturally, Leslie Nielsen is in the film.  By law, he must be in all films of this sort.  Although he's less funny than he's ever been.Jon Voight, in a brief but actually poignant scene, plays Washington.  I won't tell you more...but the moment he shares with Malone on September 11, 2001 is pretty moving, because you don't see it coming.  Yes, it's manipulative...but it also informs the viewer exactly why the creators of this film felt it was so important to make it.Are the jabs at liberals mostly obvious cheap-shots?  Yes.  But conservatives would argue (rightfully) that films like RENDITION & LIONS FOR LAMBS & REDACTED have been little more than liberal diatribes against Republicans.  So it no doubt felt good to get a little anger out of the system...and the film is fitfully amusing.  HOWEVER, if you find you have no sense of humor whatsoever about strongly held ""Democrat"" beliefs...then why get your blood boiling with a mediocre movie.  Republicans looking to get a little frustration out of their system will find the film to provide satisfactory catharsis.  The audience I saw it with was very appreciative of the film, despite its heavy-handedness.  I heard more than one person, on the way out of the theatre, proclaim, ""It's about time.""Do with this information what you will.  I'll give the film 3 stars...thus neither recommending nor condemning it.  See, I'm so fair-minded!",N/A

1231450,"The great disappointment of Peter Jackson's ""The Lovely Bones"" isn't that it's so unpleasant, but that it tackles unpleasantness in a way that, for the most part, isn't compelling. It tells the story of Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a murdered teenage girl whose spirit wanders in a kind of emotional purgatory, and even in death, she's angry at her killer and desperate for her family to move forward; while the idea is indeed a powerful one, the structure of the film is so disjointed and psychologically confusing that it's difficult for the idea to completely sink in. This is a well intentioned story, and there were individual moments I thought were handled nicely. But on the whole, it falls short, lacking focus, precision, and the right balance between plot, spectacle, mystery, and heavy-handed drama.As the spirit of Susie wanders through a spectacular dreamscape of vast oceans, immense mountains, and sprawling fields, she periodically interjects with voiceover narrations, which not only diminish the power of interpretation, but also are so shamelessly poetic, mature, and philosophically profound that they really just belabor the point. If there's anything we learned from Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner,"" it's to trust that the audience will understand what's going on without the aid of droning verbal explanations. I'm well aware that Alice Sebold's original novel was written in the first person, but must I remind you that books are not movies and movies are not books? When a story is finally given the visual treatment, when the words on the page are reinterpreted for the big screen, long stretches of expository dialogue are simply not necessary.Neither the novel nor the film made any secret of the identity of Susie's killer; we know right off the bat that it was her neighbor, George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). It's much easier to believe in this character when he's alone in his house, methodically toiling away on finely detailed dollhouses and precise scale drawings for underground hideaways, ones that will eventually be made from branches, wood, and earth. He's isolated, addicted to routine, and always scheming - a man obsessed. When he's in the presence of other people, however, he isn't even remotely convincing as the man no one would suspect of being a serial killer. Not once does he seem like a ""normal"" neighbor, not even when the police are interrogating him in his living room.Caught in the middle of this tragedy is Susie's family, who for months endure painful uncertainties. Her father, Jack (Mark Wahlberg), is especially hard hit, eventually becoming so obsessed with discovering the truth that he drives away his long suffering wife, Abigail (Rachel Weisz). Of all the things ""The Lovely Bones"" gets wrong, it's portrayal of the Salmon family is just about right, Jackson apparently understanding that everyone mourns in their own way and that some have a harder time of it than others. The only exception to this is Susie's grandmother, Lynn (Susan Sarandon), who I never once believed was capable of bringing stability back into the Salmon home; she's a hard-drinking, chain-smoking, wise-cracking hurricane of a woman so stylistically out of place that it's impossible to accept her.Other characters, most notably Susie's would-be love interest (Reece Ritchie) and misunderstood former classmate (Carolyn Dando), are adequately played but serve no real purpose other than to provide Susie with another outlet for wordy narrations. Even Len Fenerman, the detective assigned to investigate Susie's disappearance (Michael Imperioli), isn't given much to do except generate tension within the Salmon family for failing to find leads. I was, however, taken with Susie's sister, Lindsay (Rose McIver), a strong-willed, independent young woman who goes the lengths others aren't willing to go. This leads to the film's most effective scene, when she breaks into George Harvey's home and searches for clues. The suspense is palpable, to say the least.If only the rest of the film had been as well-crafted. There's no denying that deep emotion courses through the story, and yes, much of it is relatable. In addition, there is something to be said for sparing the audience from disturbing visuals that would have amounted to nothing but shock value, namely Susie's murder and dismemberment. And, of course, the scenes of Susie in spirit-world are visually creative; I especially enjoyed a shot of gigantic ship-in-a-bottle kits sailing on a turbulent ocean and crashing against the rocky shore, which happens just as Jack angrily smashes his own ship-in-a-bottle collection. None of this is an issue. What is an issue is that, for everything it was meant to be emotionally and visually, the inconsistent tones and development of character made none of it convincing.That being said, I'm sure many will respond to this movie, regardless of whether or not they've read Sebold's novel. Not everyone can relate to the pain of losing a loved one, especially if violence was involved, but most can imagine what it must be like, and the simple truth is that Peter Jackson knows this and uses it to his advantage. Take from this movie what you will. I personally would have preferred a more coherent screenplay, one that relied less on narrative passages and more on plot, plausible character development, and style. It would be too much to say that ""The Lovely Bones"" is a bad film; in spite of the end result, its heart was in the right place. It would be more accurate to say that it's awfully misguided, like singing when you know the words but not the music.",The Lovely Bones
854158,"It was definitely one of the best epic movies I've ever seen. other friends discuss about it much, but I have to complain about the DVD release in USA! or even the premiere in USA!

That said, the sound is flat and the color is somewhat washed out. In short, I still have an SP videocassette of LIFE WITH FATHER captured from an airing 20 years ago on American Movie Classics, and it's better than the Digicom mastering.

The whole ""family killing"" scene (What was Roy Schieder doing in this??) was not only off-putting but too long and unnecessary.C. - Kept Rebecca Stamos' on-screen whining down to a minimum.Things the Producer/Director got 100% right:1. Punny's costume and weapons (The compound bow was an excellent choice.)2. The ancillary villains: Honkey-Tonk guy and the Russian - interesting bad guys are always good.3. The actor who played Punny and most of his dialog - good choice.Some critics disliked the characters in the apartment but I have to admire the producers for taking one of the more interesting and recent comic storylines, that introduced these characters, and using it in this movie.The next Punisher film will hopefully be alot better paced than this one.",N/A

1481168,"I really enjoyed GI Joe Rise of Cobra. It was not perfect but it was a good movie. In an age where cinema gives the audience reboots, sequels, prequels, and adaptations, here are my thoughts on GI Joe Retaliation.Returning to the movie: Channing Tatum as Duke, Ray Park as Snake Eyes, Byung-hun Lee as Storm Shadow(good performance), Jonathan Pryce as the President, and taking the role as primary villain this time around; Arnold Vosloo as Zartan. New additions include: Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, RZA as Blind Master, D J Cotrona as Flint, Bruce Willis as Joseph Colton, and the beautiful Adrienne Palicki as Lady Jaye(yes she IS hot). The acting was not the best all the way through, but I do not always expect ""the greatest acting ever"" with a movie like this.The story line is actually quite fun, and there will be some surprises thrown your way while watching this movie. Occasionally, there are times when the script goes all over the place and it does have a few cheesy one liners, but it does have its undeniably funny moments including (spoiler) watching Channing Tatum play video games. The story may not be the best, but Retaliation does deliver the goods in terms of action, sound, and its core plan as a movie.As stated in my headline, I feel Retaliation is not entirely better than its predecessor, but it is a good feeling when despite the flaws, and major/minor differences, you still find yourself enjoying a movie for what it is. GI Joe Retaliation is likable as a sequel, and while i do feel improvements can/should be made, I see no problem with a 3rd movie being made. As a matter of fact, I welcome it.7.4/10",N/A

1505359,"The new horror thriller ""Cold Sweat"" is a movie sure to divide its audience. I suspect that there will be plenty of aggressively negative reviews on one hand, but a number of equally supportive raves as well. This exercise in outrageousness from Argentina may not make a lot of sense in the grand scheme of things, but its sheer wackiness almost compensates for its narrative shortcomings. As much as my instincts tell me that I should completely write this one off, I simply can't. Part of my nature embraces what I like to call ""bad movie magic,"" and this spirited film embraces a nonsensical lunacy that it's hard not to appreciate on some level. So if you can disconnect your common sense and just enjoy the visceral unpleasantness of ""Cold Sweat,"" the movie does offer a uniquely skewed nightmare with a gritty visual style.Transpiring in what amounts to real time, this eighty minute film takes place almost entirely within the confines of one decrepit domicile. A man and his female friend arrive at the location because he is searching for answers about his recent break-up. They've tracked down this address as belonging to someone his ex engaged with online, and he wants to confront his former girlfriend. Once he gets inside, however, things go from bad to worse as unimaginable horrors are around every bend. Two elderly political radicals, strange experiments, and a house full of unstable explosives are just a few of the hurdles our hero must face. Can he find his girlfriend? Can anyone ever find the door out? Just what's happening in the basement? And who will survive this ever-escalating night of dread? No spoilers here, this is truly one you have to watch.The Bad:The political back story of the villains is vague and unenlightening.The current goals of the villains are also rather open-ended.Their experiments get no explanation.The good guys bumble around instead of trying to get out.Oftentimes they are hiding within one foot of the bad guys in plain sight, but aren't discovered.Good guys never seek help or do anything that seems rational.The Good:Amusing banter of villains, like a dysfunctional married couple.Good effects, nicely photographed.A few nice horror moments, even if they don't always make sense.Unsettling atmosphere.In truth, the cons probably outweigh the pros if you're keeping count. But writer/director Adrian Garcia Bogliano is committed to this piece of madness. I found moments painfully dumb and the script was filled with unanswered questions, but I couldn't tear my eyes away. And I was laughing throughout the ending (unintentional or not). If you analyze this picture, it just doesn't work. But if you're expectations are in check, there is plenty of gleeful nastiness. Almost a bad movie classic. I can't recommend this to most people, but some will truly embrace the insanity. KGHarris, 1/12.",Cold Sweat

The story is about an innocent man who is dead ringer for a gangster-informant-in hiding. Benigni plays both roles.It's a decent movie, a low-key comedy that has some funny moments but would have been much better had it been chopped down about 15 minutes. It tends to drag a bit during the second half. Benigni, as the ""wimp,"" is a very charming guy and one that's easy to root for, but the rest of the characters in the film are just so-so.

1141580,"The Grand is a mockumentary that lacks Chris Guest's magic touch, but does have its moments. It's a lampoon of an easy target: poker and the selling of it and the WSOP on tv. The subject needs little tinkering to be funny/ stupid: the real shows are such hymns to greed and selfishness that one need add little.The highlights here are a few of the actors, specifically Chris Parnell as the internet poker geek, Herzog as The German (playing into type, perhaps), McKean as Steve Lavisch (clearly based on Steve Wynn), and a few of the others at moments. Woody is good enough as a Ted Binion-type, and David Cross is a humorous cross between Howard Lederer and Phil Hellmuth (now there's an unholy union), with Cheryl Hines as his Annie Duke-ish sister. Any poker fan will recognize the references, but will probably also wonder why this isn't quite as funny as it should have been.Director Penn has his concept right but never delivers in full; there are laughs but many are forced. My favorite line is Cross' ""Is that Rush?"", and one guesses it was an improv, like much of this. But where Guest has an ensemble that can ad lib with genius, only Cross and McKean can do it at that level here. And seeing as McKean is in all of Guest's movies, I'd recommend all of those before this.Nonetheless, if you've played cards much or watched the WSOP on the tube, you're bound to enjoy some of The Grand. But if you're not a poker fan, there will be precious little for you here. Not to worry; you'll see many worse rivers than that as life plays out.",The Grand
1653580,"The Battle of Westerplatte was the first battle of World War II during the Nazi invasion of Poland. Though doomed from the start, the 200 soldiers garrisoned at Westerplatte held out for seven days, thus serving to inspire a nation as a symbol of resistance. In the process of enduring a naval bombardment, assault troops and dive bombers, the defenders of Westerplatte kept well over 3,000 German troops busy, buying time for other parts of Poland to prepare their defenses. The fact they didn&#8217;t stand a chance only served to reinforce, in the eyes of Poland and the rest of the free world, how vital it was to stand up to Hitler.It&#8217;s great subject matter for a film, and writer/director Pawel Chochelew has come up with a winner for the most part, even managing to inject some truly artful moments into what could easily have been just another World War II film. The problem is the special effects mostly, and the staging of the battle scenes, in part. Let&#8217;s face it, audiences are more sophisticated about CGI effects these days , so if you&#8217;re going to use them, they have to be well done. The above-mentioned dive bombers are a particularly good example of bad special effects.In Poland, the title of the film is slightly different, translating as THE SECRET OF WESTERPLATTE. Apparently the secret is that the men defending Westerplatte were actually commanded by Second in Command Capt Dabrowski, and not by Major Sucharski. While this is of only passing interest to audiences simply looking for a good war movie, it does aid the human interaction during the siege.Apparently Major Sucharski had some sort of mental breakdown during the battle, which paved the way for Capt Dabrowski&#8217;s taking over command. The scenes depicting Sucharski&#8217;s breakdown (here interpreted as epilepsy) are very well done and the director manages to find a way to bring something fresh to the war movie genre. Interesting as this is, the poor special effects and sometimes ineptly shot battle scenes (the German soldiers&#8217; frontal beach assault looks ridiculous) undermine these efforts at originality.In the end, one&#8217;s enjoyment of 1939 BATTLE OF WESTERPLATTE will be determined by what is more valued: interesting human interaction or battle scenes.",N/A

When I revieiwed Old Dogs, I had concept in mind as the jacket clearly states - ""Fun for the Whole Family.""Synopsis:  Dan (Robin Williams) and his best friend and business partner Charlie (John Travolta) are on the verge of the biggest deal in the history of their sports marketing firm when their lives are turned upside down by a surprise visit from Dan's ex-wife Vicki (Kelly Preston). Vicki has big news for Dan--their ever-so-brief liaison produced twins Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta), now seven-years-old and in need of a dad to keep an eye on them for two weeks. With only high-living playboy Charlie for support, Dan's bumbling attempts at ""on the job training"" in fatherhood result in a series of disastrously funny exploits that lead him to a new understanding of what really matters in life.

This would not have been my favorite kind of movie as the comedy bordered on just plain dumb at times.  However, the last time I said that about a movie, my brother thought it was great.  My husband who also viewed it with me found that the majority of the humor was over the top but towards the end, he was glued and dying of laughter.  The movie has a sweet story of a father getting to know his children for the first time and the sacrifices he must make to get to know them.There were times when the humor was not appropriate for young children and they might question what the actors were talking about.  Overall my husband and I would give this movie a B rating.  He would probably watch again but I don't know as I would have my two year old watch it.",N/A
148593,"After the success, or rather lack thereof, of ""Curse of the Pink Panther"", Blake Edwards realized he had to accept that Peter Sellers was no more and that he still needed to bring the name Clouseau back into the franchise, even if it meant giving Sellers' classic character an illegitimate son.Enter future Oscar winner Roberto Benigni, who would actually receive the exact opposite of an Oscar for this role.  He's clean-shaven, part Italian Jacques Gumbrelli Clouseau Jr., not mustached Jacques Clouseau, making this a new character and leaving Benigni to the type of humor that works for him.Unfortunately, the humor doesn't work for the entire movie.  The movie moves almost completely away from the overdone routines of the rest of the series, but there are only a few laugh out loud scenes, with some small chuckles in between.  The biggest problem with the film, though, would have to be the plot.  Pink Panther plots have been mangled messes before, but never to this extent.  There's so much political intrigue and scandal involved that it's hard to figure out what anyone's motivation in, even during the climax.Herbert Lom is back for his final performance as Chief Inspector Dreyfus, now more sane and subdued.  Burt Kwouk is also back reprising his reoccurring role as Kato, the late Clouseau's humble servant.  Disguise master Professor Balls, played in the most recent films by Harvey Korman, is now played by Graham Stark, a friend of Sellers who appeared in different roles in many of the films.  These performances almost make the movie feel like a valid part of the series.Henry Mancini's score, as in all of the films, is the highlight, and Bobby McFerrin's performance of the theme music is perfect.  Especially when it provides the background for a battle between an animated Benigni and the famous Pink Panther cartoon character, racing around a live action concert hall.But the bottom line, sadly, is that the plot's a mess and the film isn't as funny as the Peter Sellers classics, or even the previous entry sans-Sellers, ""Curse of the Pink Panther.""",Son of the Pink Panther VHS
1525562,"I love the movie, it's the best video game movie of all time, and probably in my top 10 favorite Disney films.Other reviews have tackled the movie's plot, so I'm going to stick to reviewing the details of the 2D Blu-ray disc. I do not have a 3D set or a surround sound system, so I cannot comment on those.The picture quality on the Blu-ray is superb. No artifacts, color banding, off color skin tones or other problems that come from compression or a bad transfer. It looks like you're looking through a crystal clear glass window straight into the world of the movie. The clarity is amazing. If you're a gamer with a large TV, you'll get a lot of joy out of pausing the playback to pick out cameos and references in the backgrounds that you missed in the theater.The sound is likewise excellent. The dialog is clear as a bell, with no muddiness in the sound effects or musical score. This is a real bonus, since many of the video game references are auditory. For example, the sound effect when Sargent Calhoun charges her gun is taken from Mega Man X.Love the movie itself, but extras is where this release falls flat. There's five deleted scenes (with an optional commentary track), four promotional commercials made for Litwak's Arcade, a &#34;making of&#34; documentary that runs about 20 minutes, and the Paperman short shown before the film. There is a trivia feature that pops up on screen when you pause the movie, but it loops after around 10 minutes. Watching everything would take you about an hour, and that's if you watched the deleted scenes twice for the commentary track. I was expecting a lot more.Where are the cast interviews? The character galleries? I want to know what kind of legal wrangling they had to go through to get all those cameos. There isn't even a commentary track. Disney couldn't even get some of the staff or cast members to sit down and talk about the movie for an hour and a half?The lack of concept art is particularly annoying, because they show brief flashes of some it during the featurette and it looks really interesting! Then there's the music, which they don't talk about AT ALL. Come on Disney, you got Buckner and Garcia to record a new song for the credits, and it's not even mentioned.Maybe they'll be pushing an &#34;Ultimate Edition&#34; with all of the stuff that should have been on this release a few years from now.5 stars for the movie.2 stars for the extras.",Wreck It Ralph
1616397,"(Spoilers)  The filmmakers on this had a great story that they somehow screwed up.  The book ""Making Of Psycho"" is the backbone of this film.  Somehow the producers decided however in order to secure a name actress to play Mrs Hitchcock they expanded her role in this film to include a 2nd story about her and a relationship with a screen writer.  They also changed many other things around and changed some facts. This did not need to be done in order to tell a compelling story.I know this is not a documentary but ""Hitchcock"" could of stayed the course of the book (on which this film is based on).  What should  of been done (Spoilers) was how Alfred Hitchcock himself stood in the shadow of this film for the rest of his career. Also Studio politics could of been told. This film could of focused on how movie going habits were changing at the time ""Psycho"" was released.

1419855,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Ignoring all the real-life hubbub about Kercher and Knox, Murder on Trial in Italy is an okay made-for-TV film. Hayden Panettiere does a fine job making Knox a bit ambiguous. She doesn't play her as the trumped-up sexpot of the media, nor as the innocent angel her supporters would have you believe in. Instead, she's confused young woman who we can't quite believe. Some of her actions can put down to her age and inexperience, but others are a bit more troubling. Knox's supposed partner in crime, Guiliano Mignini, is ably played by Vincent Riotta, who bears a striking resemblance to his real-life counterpart in some shots. The film also managed to snag the dependable Marcia Gay Harden as Amanda's mother. She's the one responsible for really driving home the prosecutorial aspect of Amanda's treatment.Despite the sensational aspects of the film's title, and the trial, the film could be a lot worse. Sticking to a fairly simple flashback structure, it starts with the discovery of the body and works backwards to fill in the details of Amanda's life.Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy comes to DVD in a simple, solid package. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is bright and colorful, belying the dark nature of the story. I didn't notice any significant compression or authoring problems, and this DVD looks about as good as you can expect from contemporary television. The audio is a bit less impressive, but totally serviceable. Dialogue is kept clear in this simple stereo mix, never overwhelmed by effects or music.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",Amanda Knox: Murder On Trial In Italy
1116067,"Joshua is a fantastic movie... for the final 30 minutes.  The first half is total nonstop disappointment involving such a ridiculously slow-moving pace that the film is almost a chore to watch.However the movie does a fantastic job making viewers wonder who really *is* the bad person- the mother who doesn't care about/flat out ignores her older son Joshua after the birth of her baby daughter, dislikes and disapproves when the grandmother comes over and tries to change the family's religious beliefs therefore making Joshua change his outlook on life, and just doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on that all important thing called motherhood.  An unfit/uncaring mother basically.Or is Joshua (the son) the bad person?  He's the one who seems really cold-hearted and unaware of his actions.  He seems willing to learn just as frequently as he does disagreeing and going against his parents wishes whenever he can despite how much the mother and father try to stop it from happening.The movie does a pretty good job during the second half making us wonder if Joshua really is responsible for the horrible things that seem to happen whenever he's around therefore leading us to conclude that the boy has mental issues, however the first hour and 10 minutes is so flat out *boring* with hardly any suspense or excitement whatsoever that the movie honestly can't be saved.  What happens during the first half you're probably wondering?  The boy learns piano, tries to adapt to a world with a new sibling, and goes out to museums with his grandmother learning about religion (actually, more like teaching his grandmother about religion).  Nothing really enticing occurs during this lengthy period of time so it feels like useless storytelling.I think what bothers me the most is the mother.  She does absolutely nothing to convince me she's mature or responsible enough to handle taking care of a child, let alone a children and a baby.  The father... well, it's best not to spoil his involvement with Joshua.  It's surprising to say the least.  I'm referring to the final 10 minutes.  Did NOT see that one coming.Overall, a slow first half doesn't really warrant a viewing in this case I'm afraid.  30 minutes of excitement and 70 minutes of boredom isn't a good ratio at all.",Joshua
290276,"Remote Control is a bad, yet enjoyable 80's sci-fi movie-within-a-movie about Aliens trying to take over the world that stars two less talented younger siblings of famous actors of the era--Kevin Dillon and Jennifer Tilly.Remember back in the 80's, when home video was new, and there was a mom and pop video store on every corner?  You know, back before Blockbuster put them all out of business?  Meg's younger sister plays the hot chick who comes into the little no name video store to ask for some crappy sci-fi movie from the 50's.  Since this was way back when video rental was a new concept, and people were a lot less picky, it's already checked out.  The video comes in after the store closes, and the boss tells Matt's little brother that he has to deliver it to her house, despite the fact that she's only asked about it, and not actually paid for it yet.That's an unusual rental policy, you may say to yourself, my video store never gives me front door service.  Well, it's actually a much more common practice than you would think.  As a former video store employee, as well as a female sci-fi/horror fan, I happen to know that ALL sci-fi/horror geeks who work in video stores have a policy of giving front door service to anyone who comes in asking for some ultra geeky sci-fi or horror movie, if they also happen to be really hot chicks.  This is most common among hot women who ask for Star Wars movies, but is not limited to one series or gender.  Also, and this is probably just a coincidence, but those people don't tend to rack up very many late fees, either.As you can probably guess, the video tape she wants turns out to be a means for the Aliens to control our minds and take over the world.  So this movie was obviously the key influence in Hideo Nakata's ""Ringu.""  Now, when I watched this movie, I naturally asked myself, ""hmmm...if I were an Alien race planning to mutate and take over the world, would I want to control people's minds via an old crappy sci-fi movie from the 50's that nobody remembers, or would I go for the new summer blockbuster that people keep calling the video store every ten minutes and asking about?""  Then, when the movie had ended, I became aware of how mushy my brain felt, and I realized that this wasn't a flaw in the plot at all.  It was just that the kind of people who enjoy watching old crappy sci-fi movies like this one are much easier for the aliens to reach that those who want, ""Schindler's List.""  (Although, if they wanted my advice, I would have recommended using ""Fools Rush In,"" starring Matthew Perry, for its insipid brain-numbing, as well as its mass appeal.)Perhaps that funniest thing about this movie is that it's just as bad as the 50's sci-fi movie it's trying to make fun of.  I tried to come up with a good metaphor to explain what it's the cinematic equivalent of, but I couldn't think of anything too profound.  So just think of something you've experienced that you wouldn't want to do again, but didn't actually hurt you, and you've got it.  It's got that cool 80's New Wave look, but if you're looking for sci-fi of that flavour, you should check out another 80's flick called ""Liquid Sky"" instead.",Remote Control VHS

289746,"As you can tell from the other reviews, this is a film loosely, very loosely, based on one of Louis L'Amour's early western novels. I imagine the only enjoyment Louis derived from this film was the money received in exchange for using his book.The book was published in 1955, and the book's title was Heller With A Gun, not the title of this film.  The book languished in paperback from Fawcett Gold Medal mass market books for years before Bantam republished it in 1984, 20 years after being put on film. But in the book King Mabry follows the theatrical wagons after Healy has hired a killer as guide, on a hunch Mabry then follows behind the wagons assuming a 'guardian angel' role. Much different in most respects than the silver screen would have it.For readers of Mr. L'Amour's book this film will seem very strange as the book is at its best a more serious work, however, the film, since it takes a more frivolous approach, can also be of interest. If for no other reason than with all these first rate actors now being either very old or very dead, a nostolgic air of sorts clings to it, and only the most 'die hard' L'Amour fans will find it objectionable.Do what I did:  read the book and see the movie, both in their own way are very enjoyable entertainment.Semper Fi.",N/A

768783,"This is an interesting retrospective of Jethro Tull's journey for the first 25 years. The conceptual format of vintage video excerpts in between clips of band members past and present for a reunion in an English tavern comes off as ideal. ""Witches Promise,"" shown here through a 1971 performance from Top of the Pops will make viewers say, ""Oh my God,"" and a lot of the vintage footage from the first few years is sometimes comical as you see Jethro Tull starting out as a folk-rock outfit trying to find their harder edge, which they eventually did with many years of commercial success. Jethro Tull's best decade was the 70's, musically and artistically, and this DVD should include some more concert footage from that era than what is actually provided. The clips of ""Nothing is Easy,"" ""Minstrel in the Gallery,"" ""Auqalung,"" and ""Songs From the Wood,"" are the highlights, but of all the parts from their 1973 Passion Play tour, the only clip included here is the only dull portion of that whole concept album with ""The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles,""(never quite understood that part anyway)and the excerpts from Tull's transformation into the 80's seem less interesting, especialy the video for 1989's ""Kissing Willie,"" which only serves as an embarrassment for Tull having to accept that such a great band made such a terrible song and video. The reflections and bits of interviews with Ian anderson and his bandmates is always worth a listen, and overall this anniversary collection is a must-have edition for the true Jethro Tull fan.",N/A

And Chester V happens to be Flint Lockwood&#8217;s hero.Like most sequels, Sony Pictures Animation&#8217;s &#8220;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&#8221; has a weaker story than the original.

1312263,"Bottom line first: the Last Station consists of many good pieces. There's some wonderful acting some beautiful scenery a couple of ideas to kick around but there's not enough here to make a great movie or a particularly good entertainment. Opinion on this movie is sufficiently divided such that I'm going to recommend you rent it once before committing to buying your own copy.The driving conflict central to this movie is the historical reenactment of the disagreement between a dying Count Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer) and his wife the Countess Sophia (Helen Mirren). The great author in fact had become something of a mystic and a socialist in his old age. He had been born to a certain amount of wealth and had added to it with his brilliant writing. But his philosophies were not the kind that insured wealth for his legitimate children. He would die before the Russian revolution and so never had to compare his ideals to the hermaphrodite communism that would subject more than two generations of Russians to what was called dictatorship of the proletariat but operated more like a dictatorship of the apparatchiks. Countess Sophia is of the aristocratic tradition deeply concerned with the practical problems of funding their aristocratic children. The immediate case of this philosophic this agreement was the Count's determination to sign over copyrights to all of his books to the people of Russia. The Countess was equally determined to ensure that the Tolstoy wealth would be preserved for the Tolstoy children.Around at the central argument there are fleeting references to the Tolstoian's a more or less idealistic communalist group of youths who are attempting to build a village around their inspiration's philosophies. Within this group our attention is focused on Valentin (James McAvoy) and Masha(Kerry Condun). These two are supposed to represent, I suppose youthful ideology and the beauty of the human animal or something or another. Perhaps they are supposed to be in youth something of what Tolstoy and his various lovers were in his youth. Besides the fact that they are lovely young couple and engage in very healthy sex is not much reason for them to be in this movie at some point they do become observers of the larger plot and I suppose how they react to each other is supposed to be a lesson but if you haven't figured it out yet this is all very vague.Helen Mirren and Christopher Plummer perform their roles brilliantly a task slightly easier for them because their roles and purposes are more clearly defined. In fact the two female leads Helen Mirren and Kerry Condon portray strong-willed spirited women every bit the equal of the men in their lives. Given the vacillations of Valentin, Mesha is in control of their relationship.The movie was shot in Germany but succeeds in capturing something of the beauty of a remote Russian estate.It is possible to list a number of aspects of this movie that are worthy of your time. These parts do not come together because at base the central conflict is talked out without by itself making up a full movie script. From the supporting cast there is good acting, from the writers some good writing. There are  good costumes.  All are kind of thrown in in an effort to turn this into a full length movie. I cannot say that I hate this movie. There's more to like than dislike but I'm not sure this is more than a ""one viewer"". The young lovers certainly give you something to at which to look. The dialogue gives you much to think about; but I'm not sure The Last Station ever comes together.",N/A

891980,"I hate all kinds of movies that deal with the business world. I really have had no respect for the business world since the creation of the ""Yuppie"". I feel that once the ""Yuppie"" was created that pretty much destroyed part of our work ethic. What I mean is the loyal part of the workplace. I see people float around from one workplace to another after a short time. I feel that when the ""Yuppie"" was created that the days of the long-term relationships with employer and employee were severed, and therefore no chance of making friends with those we work with, and work became less-appealling. I feel that's what happened in this movie as I would see people getting jerked around not knowing whether they will have a job tomorrow, or not, and bowing to a corporate raider like he/she's God. Having to sell out all your values for cold hard cash, and flaunt it in front of everybody. Well this movie did that, but it also showed a person can change when he/she wants to. With the supporting character of Carter he plays opposite Dennis Quaid as Quaid's boss, and he climbed up the corporate ladder rather fast as he's only 26. He would get married, and then divorced in short order, and then he rebounds with Quaid's oldest daughter, and then loses her. Quaid in the meantime has done the job shuffle all throughout the movie. I see this as the workplace out of balance where those who are at the top make out all right, and those in the middle like Quaid and Carter take a risk of getting fired, or laid off. I see this as a movie that makes me not want to go to work, but do like Carter does at the end of the movie, and that's jogging on the beach; not sure whether he has a job, or not, but at least he's happy. I look back, and see that the conception of the ""Yuppie"" was done in 1981 when Reagan fired all the air traffic controllers at Eastern Airlines when they went on strike. This destroyed the union as a whole as it became easier for corporations to thrwart strikes, and keeping unions in check, and keeping workers uncertain about thier futures. I just hate the plots like this, but this was done rather well with the performances of Quaid, Scarrlett Johannsen as Quaid's eldest daughter, and Carter.

From there, the presentation jumps the rails in a hurry. Once inside the box, you'll discover 2 cardboard books of disks. Rather than set the books up with conventional pages, the books unfold in a cumbersome, multi-folded, gate fold. Each facet of this double-sided arrangement holds 3 disks in tight fitting pockets. It's here that the scratched disk phenomenon arises. (So far, my set has escaped the problem.)The double-sided, multi-folded booklets make searching for a specific disk awkward, but they haven't completely turned the set into a mockery of common organizational principles - yet. That comes when you realize that the colors of the disks are randomly assigned, not by season, episode, nor any other rationale. They're just random colors. So to select say, Disk 5 of Season 3, you have to pull disks from their pockets and read the smallish print to find the area of the book that has Season 3, then keep pulling until you find Disk 5. I have no doubt that this unnecessary handling leads to many a scratched disk. Just as confusing, is the icon in between the season number and disk number. It consists of a pentangle of 5 'blocks', with one highlighted, and a number in the middle. Nowhere is it explained what this signifies. It obviously has nothing to do with season, disk or episode.The shame of it is, with just a little bit of thought, or even basic organizing principles, this could have been a great boxed set.

Directed by Anders Banke, the film is another vampire flick that blends quirky humor, visceral vampirism and genetics as its main premise. The film is a little flimsy if you talk about its plot but the movie is quite fun.Annika (Petra Nielsen) and her daughter Saga (Grete Hayneskold) had just moved into a snow-laden town somewhere in Sweden. Annika had accepted a position at a local hospital led by an enigmatic Doctor Beckert (Carl-Ake Eriksson). The area is currently experiencing a month-long lack of sunlight and abundance of polar weather. Meanwhile, a young cocky medical assistant named Sebastian (Jonas Carlstrom) steals a batch of red pills from Beckert's office, either out of curiosity or for a ""party favor"" for his friend Vega (Emma Aberg) isn't really clear. After Sebastian takes a red pill, he begins to feel a little sick and very odd; his senses become enhanced, he even begins to hear dogs talk and has gained an intolerance to normal food.

I guess the best way to describe the movie would be a collision of quirky comedy and blood-soaked adrenaline, it bounces around jump scares and comedy while maintaining a feeling of tension. The movie's plot is full of gaps and characterization is kept at a bare minimum. The ""30 Days of Night"" angle isn't really brought into play as much as I would have liked since this element only serves as a very minor ingredient to the film's plot. The film's central focus falls upon its teenage characters such as Sebastian, Vega and company who are out to have fun.Sebastian takes center stage as the first victim of the red pill. His slow transformation to a vampire pretty much sets the film's tone and I have to admit, the sequences really cracked me up. It comes off a little grim at times, as we see Sebastian trying to drink his household condiments (ketchup, milk, juice etc.) and finds that his body is rejecting them. The young man's meeting with his girlfriend's parents become rather humorous as her father is a minister and you can guess what happens when he hears him saying `grace' and gets fed with a trout cooked in garlic sauce. Yes, the film does have its charm and parts of it were very funny and entertaining.Sadly, the film has several plot missteps that I thought were just rather disappointing. The plot with our mysterious Dr. Beckert is a little underdeveloped that this subplot never becomes compelling or interesting. I also felt that the sequences with Beckert and Annika didn't match the tone of the rest of the film. In this area, the film feels rather episodic and lacked coherency in its script. I thought the movie was going to be a solid comedic bloodbath but this area just felt a little too forced. The Nazi angle at the beginning of the film didn't really reach any inherent gravity to the narrative; it feels rather insignificant. It does provide some background to the vampire named Maria and to Beckert, but the way it just becomes attached into the plot is very difficult to buy into. However, I liked Beckert's transformation sequence, I thought it was a good homage to old-school effects.""Frostbitten"" has a lot of things going on between the fun-hungry teenagers and the Annika-Beckert struggle and the film does have several editing tricks up its sleeve. It did hold my focus and I felt like I was watching one of your cheesy horror low-budget films. I guess this was what the director intended. The vampires are curiously very sensitive to light, they can be repelled by a copy machine and even by a car's powerful headlights. The vampires themselves have the superhuman qualities we see in most vampire movies; strong, fast and feral. The vampires can be killed by the usual traditional means. The film also does have very nice cinematography that accentuates the frozen environment. From the indoors and the outdoors, the film does have the right atmosphere.This Swedish vampire thriller relies on its visuals and brings the core of its story from genetic studies. I thought the transformation from human to vampire through the use of a pill is a little hard to buy into. The film is also very predictable and rather unoriginal; it also lacks innovation and feels very routine with its barefaced scares. To its credit, the film does have its charm and leanness; the film has enough vampire stunts, humor and bloody scenes to charm the horror fan. The film is amiable enough and accompanied by good visuals, ""Frostbitten"" can be fun when you're in the mood for a vampire movie with flamboyance and comedic allure.Recommended!

1455652,"Bill Nighy is absolutely superb and the acting level overall is extraordinarily high. The GOOD and why THREE STARS.Basically, it is a movie based on &#34;smart&#34; word play. I know it is British, but at the one hour point I stopped. The film &#34;Wild Target&#34; with Bill is still the best film to watch him excel!! Its has the &#34;smart&#34; word play, is fun, has a plot that moves faster than a snail too.This movie's plot line is slow - really, really slow to develop. My deep problems are with the plot line and Nighy's numerous relationships with women (his neighbor, his daughter, his lover, his ex-wife, etc.). The plot line has too many illogical holes (and the film resembles closely one other Nighy movie on world hunger) in its politically illogical allusions (I am trying not to put spoilers in my review). Bill's character is sold as a moral man within a corrupt political framework (pretty standard idea but is actually sophistry in this movie's dialog). Then there are the &#34;straw men&#34; to hate and also created as hollow characters. The character development of the British Prime Minister (Fiennes) is missing as is the character development of the Deputy Prime Minister. They are for target practice only, not to be really known. The disingenuous plotting had me wondering why I kept watching for a full hour but then I realized it was Nighy, his work was beyond belief.Nighy's relationships with the women around him played as disjointed puzzle pieces forced together but not fitting. The movie in fact reminds me of a long running British play - No Sex Please, We Are British! He shows no emotion invariably. His rapid trust in his neighbor (Weisz) is not believable as the depth of his feelings develops almost immediately (hmm...), his difficult relationship with his daughter is a patch job (time after time she is disappointed by his negative/caustic comments yet according to Nighy's character she really cares about his approval. What!) Their interaction plays more like a defiant teenager and a controlling parent, not as two adults. And it continues... Nighy's character does show affection in one line with his lover (better catch it as its short).",Masterpiece Contemporary: Page Eight

1156168,"One is immediately drawn to the thrilling premise based on the eponymousStephen Gould novel(with liberal dilutions to the story) about a young lad named David who can teleport himself. One then sees the star-studded crew behind this caper and is almost certain to savor it: the director of The Bourne Identity, and script writers of Fight Club, Batman Begins and Mr. and Mrs. Smith.Yet, despite all that they ought to have had going for themselves, somehow these cooks managed to make a stunning scattershot mess of this sci-fi broth. They decided, I suppose, that a movie named Jumper would do well with a jumpy screenplay.  Why trouble yourself with exploring the socio-psychological ramifications of teleportation or some such meaningful effort, when you can opt for a wannabe-epic adventure targeted at the nose-pierced crowd?Landscapes switch at 60,000 frames per second. Our hero has lunch in Rome only to digest it all while surfing in Fiji. You know how it works. The teleporting bits are fine, but how a puny little teenager who was chronically ragged by bullies at school learned to do all the funky stuff at will, goes a trifle unexplained.Soon enough, our supra-hero discovers that his abilities have landed him in the persecuted half of an old historic war. Sigh. On one side are his band of teleporting buddies called Jumpers -- all mysteriously young and fit, one quite thoughtfully a British (where were the token black and Chinese buddies?). On the other side are efficient ""Paladins"" organized to demolish them. The chief Paladin is a self-same Samuel Jackson sporting a silver crew-cut.Now, for some uncommon reason, David has a nice revealing collection of photographs at home. Snapshots of *all* the places in the world to which he ""jumps"". Which naturally aids our chief Paladin's search. But not before a romantic angle is tossed in as David takes his high-school girlfriend out to Rome for a swing -- they fly regular Northwest of course, despite the hunt on for his arrest at NSA level.The plot holes are large enough for obese teleporters to jump through. Christensen, an actor chosen clearly to appeal to the younger Star Wars fans, would have done well to consider a repertoire of at least two facial expressions. The final 15 minutes or so have so much rammed into them, with pulse-pounding heavy metal music of course, that one wonders if the film was about to overrun its deadline and had to be chip-chopped in a rush.The loud hints at the end suggest that there might be a Jumper II. Optimistic as that may be, one hopes they will rope in someone else to write, direct, act in, and score it. The theme and Stephen Gould surely deserve better.",Jumper
727566,"One can look at the cover and tell right off the bat what it is, and besides being a girly chick flick romantic comedy starring Mathew PErry, Elizabth Hurley, Bruce Campbell, and Cedric the Entertainer.  However this particular title provides some decent laughs for both sexes.Serving Sara is about Mathew Perry who is process server.  Basically he delivers court orders to a prticular person, and hopes he doesn't die.  He's good at his job however until he seems to hit a two month rut, mostly caused by one of his associates Tony.  Elizabeth Hurly is plays Sara, a beutiful women who is happily married to her handsome husband (played by the always funny Bruce Campbell).  Little does she realize that he is cheating on her is about to file for divorice.  Cederic plays Mathews Boss who is giving him this one last chance, an easy job.  However when he (Perry) goes to deliver the papers she ends up giving him an offer he couldn't refuse.  At this point the comedy really begins as the movie turns into a romantic, slapstick, physical comedy.The main problem with Serving Sara is that the focus on PErry and Hurley, there funniest moments are shown in the trailers.  FOr the most part the movie when it focus on them turns into utter blaw at many moments.  In fact it is the Bruce Campbell and Cederic who really light up the screen when they are on.OVerall Serving Sara is not utter drek that many romantic comedies end up being.  However with a fairly lack of focus at times and the fact that some of the humor does backfire makes this movie a renter only.  A good date flick, but certainly something not worht owning.",N/A
333107,"There are some differences between the plots of &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Home Along 2: Lost in New York.&quot;  Instead of going to his family going to France for Christmas they are going for Florida, instead of the family leaving them behind Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets on the wrong plane, instead of an old guy next door he befriends an old lady in the park, and instead of taking place in a Chicago suburban home it takes place mainly in a swank New York hotel.  Of course, all these changes are ultimately immaterial because John Hughes is sticking close to the original formula for his smash 1990 release for this 1992 sequel, even if Chris Columbus gets the joy of directing.The same three elements that worked so successfully with the original are present again.  First, Kevin gets to enjoy the highlife without his parents, enjoying the power of his father's credit card.  Second, Kevin once again gets to take down the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), when their paths get crossed again.  Third, there are the poignant moments with the kindly older folk that Kevin runs into, and his mother (Catharine O'Hara) has a lot more to do this time around in her frantic efforts to get to New York and look for her son.  However, the fun is a little less enjoyable, the creative attacks on the goofy bandits seem less comic and more painful, and the heartstring have already been plucked and sound more hollow in this sequel.  If you are young enough to be happy that everything is just as you expect and do not mind the formula being followed right down the line, then you will find &quot;Home Alone 2&quot; more palatable.

1052961,"I read Tom Perrotta's ""Little Children"", on which the film is based, right before seeing the film, and I think the translation to the screen suffers in the comparison. Had I not read the novel first, I suspect I would have given it four or five stars, as many reviewers here have done. But the novel is really much better -- and even though Tom Perrotta adapted his own novel for the screenplay, it just isn't as good.The acting, overall, is excellent. Kate Winslet is fantastic (as usual), as is Jackie Earle Haley. But Jennifer Connelly, though good, was somewhat underwhelming. Not that I blame her; she just wasn't given enough to do. Noah Emmerich and Patrick Wilson are also great, but not quite in Winslet and Haley's league.Turning to the film itself, I have to say that by far the weirdest, most distracting, and inexplicable choice is the narrative voice-over. Ugh. I don't know who to blame for this -- Tom Perotta (screenplay) or Todd Field (directing). But with only one or two exceptions, it just doesn't work -- at least, again, for those familiar with the novel.I will say that at many points, the direction and cinematography are very compelling. There's a particular sequence, designed to show the passage of time at the Town Pool over the course of the summer, that is just amazingly done. Those sorts of sequences are almost a clich&eacute; these days, but this one was fresh and visually interesting. Also, the -- ahem -- au naturel scenes between Sarah and Brad (Winslet and Wilson) are consistently framed in grey, recalling the dreary, rainy afternoon the first time they were intimate and reinforcing the ultimate emptiness of their relationship. This was a great touch.The ending of the film departs from that of the novel in a *major* way (which I will not spoil). I do have to say that in one, single respect (relating to the Ronnie McGorvey character), I think the film actually outdoes the novel. Perhaps Perotta decided he'd rather have done it differently? And it really works! But outside of that, the rest of the film's ending is anticlimactic, undramatic, and loses something very significant from the message delivered in the novel.Final verdict: pretty good (3 stars; but Amazon doesn't have  stars), but certainly not what it *might* have been, and not what I *hoped* for after reading the excellent novel on which it's based.",N/A

957162,"I have developed a taste for Ghibli studio's animations. I like them a lot and normally end up giving them 5 stars. I never thought I would give any one of them less stars than that, but I think this one was way below my expectations. The setting is very much like the commercial Japanese animation you see on TV. Lots of action parts that do not really make the story more interesting. The story has discontinuities, so that sometimes things happen that you don't have a pretex and don't know how or why. Maybe you have to read the book before you watch the movie, or you will gradually lose the chain of events. The only thing in the movie that has Miyazaki's signature, is the moving castle itself. It is artistically depicted. The rest is just like any other Japanimation.In general I am not saying this is a bad animation, but it is lower than my expectation from Miyazaki and his studio (specially after watching his other works).",N/A

He hascrafted another flawed but interesting film, Walk The Line, named afterone of Cash's biggest musical hits; this one on the life of JohnnyCash. Actress Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for Best Actress for herportrayal of Cash's wife June Carter Cash, of the famed Carter Familysingers, and while she's solid, competent, the award she won is merelyanother way for Hollywood to elevate the bankability of sexy youngstarlets- think Marissa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, Gwyneth Paltrow, JuliaRoberts, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Renee Zellwegger, CharlizeTheron, and now Witherspoon.

His framing and vistas do littleto enhance texture of the scenes, nor do they add an unconscious poeticelement. Despite globetrotting, Cash's life is portrayed as static anddull, and the love story is nothing great. What Mangold does not graspis that the real reason cash is worthy of a film is because of hissinging and songwriting. When will biopics about artists actually focuson the art, and not the soap operatic stuff? But, if they are going tofocus on the peripherals, one would think they'd play up thefascinating stuff, the legendary stuff, not the usual crap all peoplego through, for that merely shows that the subject is like the viewer,when the fascination stems from what the subject has that is NOT likethe average person.

738830,"""Secretary"" is an odd little sadomasochistic fantasy in which a lawyer and his secretary establish a kind of master/slave relationship in the office.Lee Halloway is a deeply disturbed young woman who has just been released from a mental institution where she has been recuperating from a nervous breakdown.  Lee copes with her severely dysfunctional family - her father is an alcoholic who beats his wife, while her mother is a passive victim of abuse who overprotects her daughter - by cutting, gashing and burning herself regularly.  Now, back on the outside, Lee finds employment as secretary to a paralegal, E. Edward Grey, an equally neurotic man who turns out to be a full-blown ""dominator"" behind closed doors.  Together the two forge a bizarre sexual alliance so all-consuming in its nature that one wonders how this small office ever gets any work done at all.Writer Erin Cressida Wilson and director Steven Shainberg have fun with the many ironies and paradoxes inherent in the offbeat world they are exploring.  For instance, Grey, by restricting Lee's freedom of choice, is actually liberating her by getting her to channel her self-abusive tendencies and desire for pain into a ""healthier,"" more ""productive"" direction.  Lee also discovers that men with unconventional sexual tastes may be no more willing to ""settle down"" and ""commit"" with a likeminded partner than many a man with more traditional sexual proclivities.In many ways, ""Secretary"" turns out to be almost a recruiting poster for the sadomasochistic lifestyle.  The S&M; scenes are kept relatively tame in tone and the film displays a wickedly funny sense of humor for most of its duration.  Moreover, the decidedly upbeat ending of the film could easily have garnished any Doris Day-Rock Hudson romantic comedy - had standards 40 years ago allowed them to explore this type of topic, that is.As Lee and Grey, Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader turn in terrific performances.  They manage to capture the quirky nature of their respective characters without ever making them appear off-putting or grotesque.  Their performances go a long way towards purging the material of the kind of sleaziness and smarminess one might expect to find here.The early scenes in the film may be a bit disturbing for some in the audience, mainly because we feel a bit like voyeurs ourselves peering in on the couple, almost as if they were zoo animals or subjects in some sort of psycho-sexual experiment.  But then, as we get to know the characters and come to like them, we become absorbed in their story and find ourselves actually cheering them on and wanting them to find some measure of meaning and happiness in their relationship and lives.The makers of ""Secretary"" have taken a potentially ""touchy"" subject and injected it with warmth, humanity and insight.

1578881,"The first half of this movie is very good, refreshingly low-key and original, with a believable, slowly-developing romance between Morgan and Dean in Inwood, the far northern tip of Manhattan almost never seen in movies. The relaxed, small-town, almost rural character of the place is a welcome change from the frantic pace, hard-edged greed and shallow posturing that dominate in the more fashionable areas downtown where most movies are made. The city used to have many such low-key neighborhoods that we never see in movies, so it's good to see this one while it still exists.Unfortunately, the movie sort of disintegrates in its second half. Producers Akers and Berg must have thought a simple love story would be too boring, so they shoehorned a boatload of dramatic tension into the gentle, lovely story and ruined it. There are no gay-beating thugs, which is the stock drama-injector in gay movies, and its absence here is a great relief; but the absurd and highly annoying behavior of the main character is even more infuriating in a different, if much less hackneyed, way.A consistent delight throughout the movie, though, is Jack Kesy's gentle but powerful performance as Dean.

To help Holly deal with her grief, Gerry arranges for a series of special gifts and letters to be delivered to Holly after his death. With the help of her family and a few girlfriends, Holly begin to lift herself out of her depression and embrace the chapters of her life that have yet to come.This is a sweet story that's romantic and incredibly bittersweet. The movie includes many flashbacks that depict the life Holly and Gerry shared together, which are touching and allow the audience to connect with Holly and feel her pain. There are also several beautiful sequences shot in Ireland and a strong group of supporting cast members. Obviously, so much of the film's events are incredibly unrealistic, and I also didn't care at all for Holly's relationship with the oddball David (Harry Connick, Jr.), but fortunately the film resolved that subplot very well toward the end of the film.

No band has influenced rock n roll as much as the Ramones over the past 30 years. This is a nice tribute to their legacy.Worth watching if you have any interest in the Ramones, rock n roll, or the history of punk.",N/A

863813,"Relax, and don't expect too much from 'Coronado' and then you can enjoy watching it.  I know, it's a 90-minute mindless fun.  Picture to yourself a low-budget version of 'Romancing the Stone' without Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, and you know what 'Coronado' would be like.  And you find John Rhys-Davies (his role is just a cameo) who appears as President Hugo Luis Ramos, by which you should undersrtand the film does not take itself seriouly at all.Rich and stubborn (but charming) American lady Claire (Kristin Dattilo, TV's 'The Chris Isaak Show') in fancy evening dress goes to a fictional country of Coronado, Central America, in order to find her husband who should be in Europe.  He must be cheating on her, so she believes, but what she found in the hot country turns out a cynical TV reporter Arnet (Clayton Rohner) and big adventures.  (The story reminded me of Paris Hilton in that famous show.)That's it.  Do I have to go on?  There are rebels out in the mountains, who might or might not be helpful to them.  Anyway Claire and Arnet join forces to get what they want -- hubby and scoop -- and there are lots of dangers, mostly enhanced by the CGIs.And the CGIs, considering the budget which I suppose is not high, are decent ones.  Actually they are provided by Volker Engel and Marc Weigert, the German professionals whose CV include the special effects of 'Independence Day.'  The effects of 'Coronado' never reaches the height of the Academy winning Sci-fi film (for visual effects), some of the action scenes are surprisingly thriiling.I have seen this kind of adventure films back in the 80s, and it is a little surprising that they still have power to entertain us.

667762,"Director Shohei Imamura's film, ""The Eel,"" has one great asset: Actor Koji Yakusho. No matter what role Yakusho plays, or whether the film is average or below average, Yakusho's presence always takes the film a notch above what it would otherwise be. And the same goes for this film. The story begins in the year 1988. Takuro Yamashita (Koji Yakusho) has just received an anonymous letter detailing his wifes infidelity. He reads this letter while on the train to home. Greeted by his wife, he lets her know that he will be fishing as usual. However, this is just a pretense, as his jealous mind races with the thought of catching her in bed with another man. And eventually, in a fit of anger, he will take the life of his wife. Moreover, he will bicycle down to the police station to turn himself in. Later, when he is found guilty, he will spend the next 8 years of his life in prison. And his sole companion and friend? An eel.The films narrative begins after his release from prison. Upon his release after 8 years he is given the eel by the prison guards. As this has been the one and only true confidante Takuro trusts: a friend to whom Takuro even talks to. Placed on parole and under the ever watchful supervision of a Buddhist priest named Nakajima, Takuro purchases a barber shop: isolated and alone. And more importantly, away from everyone else--or so he thinks. He feels comfortable with just his pet eel as his companion. Yet, his nightmares of his past actions never leave him, as we are witness to his uncomfortable dreams that intrude with his sleep. Contrary to what he might think, he has much guilt over his past actions. I like the character of the priest Nakajima, who is the parole officer of Takuro. The priest berates Takuro, in a good way, for not feeling remorse over his wifes death, or that Takuro does not know where she is buried--as Takuro has never visited her grave.However, it is in this isolated region that Takuro will make contact with a woman who reminds him of his wife. Moreover, this woman will change his life for the better. Discovering a woman laying in the fields, he notifies his barbershop acquaintances and the police. The woman, Keiko (Misa Shimizu) has attempted suicide. And thus begins the start of Takuro's personal journey of redemption for his crime. Regardless of what Takuro may lead himself to believe, his guilt weighs heavily on his conscious. For example, when the young woman comes to work for him, at the suggestion of the priest, she cuts herself with a small cut on her finger. Racing on his bicycle with Keiko in tow, he peddles as if her life were in danger to reach the hospital clinic miles away. For it was a knife that Takuro murdered his wife with. He cannot escape his past.Keiko, like Takuro, also seems to be a lost soul. We see her her own hardship in small flashbacks, and understand that not only does she feel unworthy of another--but feels alone too! However, circumstances will place both of these two people together. And with this Takuro's own coming terms with the terrible crime he committed. Is he capable of redemption? Can he forgive himself? Can he come to terms with what he has done? More importantly, does he understand how terrible his crime was? He wonders to himself if there ever was an anonymous letter sent to him concerning his wife infidelity. And if so, what happened to the letter? His guilt weighs on him. He cannot carry on with his life until he comes to terms with what he has done. Are there second chances for those who commit horrible crimes? And can he come to terms with what he has done? There are parts of the film that I do not wish to spoil for you, where we see Takuro trying to come to terms with what he has done, and maybe even redeem himself. As for Keiko, has she found what she is looking for? This film is recommend with caution. It is not a film that will resonate with many viewers. Therefore, I recommend you rent it first.",N/A

1215151,"It's nice to see a filmned version of the actual stage play. It gives a pretty good indication of what it feels like sitting in the audience, especially with the intermission included. The editing isn't great, but it's good enough to evoke what needs to be felt. The place where it breaks down is with the cast.Adam Kantor makes a passable Mark, but lacks the manic charm of Anthony Rapp. His vocals are solid and he does enough to carry the part.Will Chase is brutal as Roger though. His performance is more hammy than pained and his vocals get rather pitchy at times. Compare his version of ""One Song, Glory"" to Adam Pascal's version or the others who have filled the role and it just falls short. He's also pitchy at times and has to slide in to the right note too often. If intentional it's unfitting. It's a staple in country and even in some rock genres but sounds out-of-place in this context.Tracie Thoms and Eden Espinosa do a fine job in their roles as JoAnne and Maureen, respectively, but they're the only two who seem to give a perfarmance at least evocative of the original cast. Michael McElroy does a fine job, he's just not Jesse Martin which isn't ""fair"" I know as those are tough shoes to fill. Wilsone Jermaine Heredia was also a tough act to follow, and while Justin Johnston was good, again, tough shoes to fill.Renee Goldsberry is absolutely gorgeous as Mimi but just sems to be missing that extra bit of brassiness Daphne Rubin-Vega and others brought to the role.Casts change as actors move on and it's still a worthy performance. For those who haven't seen the play I suggest it, for those who have seen it with the original cast it's also still a good view, just not quite as ""magical"".",N/A

1080407,"A lot of people put a huge importance on whether or not a movie is 100% faithful to the novel it's based on.  I can certainly understand that.  If you've read the novel, you really want the movie to be faithful to the novel.  Count Dracula - BBC miniseries (1977) is nearly 100% faithful to Bram Stoker's 1897 novel.  Great.  Does this make it a great movie?  Not necessarily.This TV miniseries is 150 minutes, but the problem is that it's slow moving, dull, and rather boring.  It does have some eerie moments, some scary moments, and pretty good sound effects.  The musical score, however, is just fair at best and doesn't appear often enough throughout the movie, but that's OK, because the music just doesn't fit the type of movie this is, anyway - a Dracula movie.  The music sounds like it would fit right in with that old TV show called The Friendly Giant.  The music is very low volume, also.  There is way too much silence without music in this movie.  There are so many scenes that could use a heavy dose of dramatic music, but the music is either absent altogether or just wrong for the scene.  The movie struggles to maintain energy due to its length.  It loses steam, then things pick up again, then loses steam again.  It simply lacks power.  It lacks that much needed ""oomph"".How are the sets and special effects?  They are on the cheap side, but this isn't something I really complain about.  In fact, I'm a fan of ""raw"" low tech stuff over CGI any day.  I'm just pointing this out as part of my overall review of this movie.  The castle footage is dark and haunting.  The night footage outdoors is creepy.  However, I found huge inconsistencies with how the movie was shot.  One minute it looks like a TV movie with grainy film, then the next minute it looks like a daytime soap opera shot with videotape.  This inconsistency in filming techniques was distracting.  Grainy picture, then clear picture, then back to grainy, then back to clear.  Weird.The acting, in my opinion, is wooden for the most part.  The best acting came from Judi Bowker (of Clash Of The Titans fame).  Louis Jourdan's portrayal of Count Dracula was fair.  Nothing great.  He was too stoic, dull, and ordinary looking.I recommend this movie only for people who insist that Dracula movies follow the novel faithfully.  If you don't mind if a Dracula movie doesn't follow the novel faithfully, then I recommend other movies, such as Horror Of Dracula (1958), Dracula (1979), and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  These movies are shorter, maintain a higher intensity, and have great musical scores that liven things up.  Horror Of Dracula's musical score is by James Bernard.  Dracula 1979's musical score is by John Williams.  Bram Stoker's Dracula has a musical score by Wojciech Kilar.  Music can make all the difference in the world.",N/A
313501,"With the exception of the recent Billy Bob Thornton retelling of the tale, few epics have had quite as bad a press as John Wayne's The Alamo. If it is not the masterpiece Wayne set out to make, it is also certainly not the disaster it is often painted. Even financially the film eventually turned a very healthy profit, although the staggered nature of its roadshow release meant that it didn't do so quickly enough to save Wayne from having to sell his share in the picture he had invested so much in.Very much a personal crusade, he raised the $12m budget partially from a trio of Texas millionaires and from his own pocket. The set and surrounding village were actually built three years before shooting, ostensibly so that vegetation could grow naturally around it, though problems raising the budget seem more likely. Nonetheless, the film's much-trumpeted great pains to look authentic extends to the casting, enhanced by some of the great faces in the supporting cast, not least of them the irreplaceable Hank Worden, replacing Old Mose Harper's desire for a rockin' chair for 'the time to live and a place to die' in one of his best performances as the Parson. Laurence Harvey, a man reputedly in life as innately impossible to like as his character in The Manchurian Candidate, carries the dramatic element as Travis more than efficiently, while Wayne and Widmark give perfect demonstrations of fleshing out a part through star quality as Davey Crockett and Jim Bowie.Along with 55 Days at Peking, this was the biggest of the siege epics of the sixties (Zulu, Khartoum, The War Lord), recounting a somewhat romanticised version of the iconic battle that saw some 185 men hold off 7000 Mexican soldiers for thirteen days. Very much a populist epic, it is broadly entertaining but with a quiet dignity at its heart, and while there is sentiment, it is pure and honest enough not to seem desperately manipulative. Wayne's direction is a strong point, with a good visual eye that owes nothing to John Ford (who had less to do with the film than is commonly believed and nothing to do with the truly spectacular battle scenes) and a surprising generosity to friend and foe alike.There are many moments of pure visual poetry, too - a rider galloping through a stream, defeated Mexican troops reflected in a muddy pond while their women carry away the bodies of their loved ones and the astonishing finale where the screen is packed to bursting with thousands of extras. The cavalry sequences in particular are strikingly well handled, with a healthy respect for the horses (unlike many sixties epics, none were hurt or killed). True, it sure is a long time a-comin', but if there's a more spectacular battle scene on film this side of Bondarchuk's Waterloo, I've not seen it.Unfortunately, the DVD is something of a travesty. Facing personal bankruptcy, two weeks after the film opened Wayne asked his producer son Michael to cut the film to get in more shows to improve its cash flow - the film was popular, but at nearly three-and-a-half hours was limited to only two shows a day at a handful of theatres. No prizes for guessing which version MGM/UA have chosen to release. Although the uncut version was available on video and laser disc, the company's rationale for releasing the cut version to DVD was that since there were no foreign language soundtracks surviving for the uncut version and they were committed to releasing multiple-language versions, the cut version was preferable to subtitling the film for foreign languages. To add insult to injury, even the hour-long documentary produced for the laserdisc release has been cut back to 40 minutes to paper over any mention of the restored version!As a result, some half an hour of footage is now missing once again not much more than a decade after it was restored. Even the Overture, Intermission, Entr'acte and Exit Music from Dimitri Tiomkin's superb score have been lost. The only positive is that the widescreen transfer at least makes the most of Wayne and cinematographer William Clothier's careful Scope compositions - and films like this are what Scope is all about.As for what you're missing, much of the extra running time was taken up by slightly extended scenes, such as Travis' explaining why he knows ""I am better than that rabble"" that he commands, crucial to understanding his character. Nonetheless, there are several 'new' scenes, the more significant additions including: more of Bowie's opening scene and various bridging scenes enlarging on his conflict with Travis; the death of the profiteer Emil when he tries to stop Crockett taking the gunpowder from the church and a subsequent love scene between Crockett and Flacca; nearly a full reel after the Intermission where Bowie decides to leave the Alamo but is dissuaded by Patrick Wayne reluctantly lying about the number of reinforcements on their way; Scotty's patrol discovering the cattle and coming off badly at the hands of some pursuing Mexican Lancers and Dragoons; and the death of Parson and Crockett's quietly effective  prayer.Even if to some the film still felt too long at 203 minutes (and frankly, it do), none of these scenes should have been the ones to be cut, and their restoration helped the film flow more smoothly than the shorter version. Worse, it's not an isolated incident - MGM/UA meted out similar treatment to the restored version of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World] on DVD, while some other titles like The Dogs of War and F*I*S*T are available in two different cuts on either side of the Atlantic.The film's reputation may limit its appeal to Wayne's fans and the epic collector, but it's a fine film that deserves better treatment on DVD than it received.",N/A

507206,"I must say I hoped for more when I shelled out around $30 ( with shipping ) for the cool, full length Korean edition of the film.  The DVD quality is excellent, but the story only mediocre.We certainly get a sense of the kind of warfare and weapons involved, as well as the odds against the Finns.  The film is too long, probably due to the fact that, if I understand correctly, it originally aired as a television mini-series over multiple nights.  Perhaps the seemingly endless progression of battles is presented in the name of realism, but this IS a movie, after all, and we get the idea after the 7th or 8th ( or 11th or 12th? ) Russian charge.The acting is tepid all 'round. No one really stands out as memorable.Great equipment and lovely footage of the Finnish landscape.  Never could figure, though, why the Russians kept wasting artillery throughout the film chasing the featured character around the countryside.  Whenever a particular Finnish soldier was going toward or away from the front lines, the Russian artillery would magically always hit right around this one lone, poor soul.  Smart shells in 1939?  And Soviet aircraft dropping entire bomb loads trying to hit a soldier on a sleigh?  Not very believable.Still, the battle scenes seemed well done and the unimaginative and very costly Soviet head-on assaults are true to history.  The vast disparity in men and materiel available to the two sides and the grinding exhaustion to which the Finns were subjected are important factors handled well.All-in-all, a good movie but certainly not amongst the best of the genre.

38991,"Boris Karloff said that making films with Val Lewton helped restore his mental health. Karloff (1887-1969) started in films in 1916 and up until 1931 he was a bit player in B films. Then came ""Frankenstein"" (1931), ""The Mummy"" (1932) and ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932) and he was off on a whirlwind career that lasted for decades. In the 30s he either played the monster (Frankenstein, the Mummy) or an evil person (Dr. Fu Manchu), and he began to feel strangled by the stereotyping. Val Lewton came along and offered him a reprise from these stereotypes and a chance to do some real acting, even if it was still broadly within the ""horror"" genre.Val Lewton (1904-51) was the ""Head of Horror"" at RKO where he produced ""Cat People"" (1942), ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (1943), and ""The Leopard Man"" (1943) and teamed with Karloff on ""Isle of the Dead"", ""The Body Snatchers"" (1945), and ""Bedlam"" (1946).Lewton worked with Mark Robson (1913-78) who directed both films. He worked with Lewton on ""Cat People"" (1942) and ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (1943). He was twice nominated for an Oscar and a DGA award (""Peyton Place"" and ""Inn of the Sixth Happiness""), and twice nominated at Cannes (""Bright Victory"" and ""The Harder They Fall""). His best work was directing ""The Bridges at Toko-Ri"" (1954) and ""Champion"" (1949).These films are of interest from an historical perspective as they show Karloff in his first attempt to put aside the ""monster"" and do some real acting.

730835,"The performances are first rate:  Glenda Jackson certainly deserved her Oscar, Alan Bates is always wonderful and Oliver Reed captures your heart by his very presence.  The story is filled with the personal obsessions that drove Lawrence--finding some sort of truth in physical passion being the most obvious one.  This film adaptation is hardly subtle--driving the same ideas home again and again---starting with the lesson of the parts of the flower in the opening schoolroom scene.  Then there's the famous picnic scene where Alan Bates likens the fig to a woman's sexual part. Then there are all of explicit love scenes, including the nude male wrestling by the firelight scene between Bates and Reed.I guess all of this was pretty hot stuff when the film was made, but it strikes me as almost silly at this point in time.  Likewise the dialogue, discussing over and over the nature of love stikes me as way overly ponderous. Especially because no one solved any of their problems that way.  I guess that's one of Lawrence's demons--over intellectualizing and then trying to compensate by some sort of physical activity, mainly sex.  I'm sure many others have analyzed Lawrence's psyche endlessly so I won't bother, here, except to mention that the incredibly creepy mother of the Reed character certainly bears attention.The cinematography is great, the costumes are good, the English countryside and shots in Zermatt are beautiful.

170196,"Has there ever been a more charismatic actress than Audrey Hepburn?  So strong is the aura she creates that she can elevate problematic films like ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" to quasi-classic status.  If someone summed up Blake Edwards' film to you by describing its fatalistic characters and its cynical outlook on life, you would probably think this film would have no mass appeal whatsoever.  Yet, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a film that is still talked about and fondly remembered to this day - all thanks to Audrey Hepburn.The film opens with a magical sequence where Holly Golightly (Hepburn) exits a cab and stares dreamily into the display windows of Tiffany's while Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" plays in the background.  The opening sequence hints that this film might be a fairy tale with the elegant Holly in the lead.  However, it soon becomes obvious that her life is not the stuff of which dreams are made of.  Rather we soon discover Holly is a woman with troublesome self-esteem problems who enjoys ignoring the realities of her troublesome existence in favor of reveling in the possibilities that the future might hold for her.  Into the mix comes Paul Varjak (George Peppard), a writer who himself is plagued by his own set of troubles.  Paul is instantly smitten with Holly but their romance blooms slowly and painfully.To call the characters of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" flawed would be an understatement.  Holly finances her lifestyle by serving as a go-between between a mob boss and his lawyer and while Paul finances his by being a ""kept man"" to a wealthy woman (Patricia Neal).  Further tainting Holly's character is the revelation that she married the much older Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebson) at the age of 14.  Such unappealing characters along with the stereotypical Mr. Yunioshi (Mickey Rooney) should make this film tough to swallow.  Yet Mancini's rousing ""Moon River"" and the screen presence of Hepburn herself are such strong elements in the film that it tilts the scales in favor of ""Breakfast of Tiffany's.""  So memorable is Hepburn that she elevates the film several notches higher than where the film should actually rank in light of all its problems.  Such a feat is a testament to the enormous star power Hepburn wielded in her time and continues to wield in the present day.",N/A

On the heels of the awesome remake ofFriday the 13th (Theatrical Cut)and the very solid Halloween remakes the old boy Sid decided to give A Nightmare on Elf Street and Freddy Kruger a shot.Back in the glory days of horror, Freddy was a big player on par with Jason and Michael Myers even though Sid would put him #3 on that list by far. After seeing the new Freddy he is currently #86 on the scary list, one place ahead ofThe Gingerdead Man. Of course we all know the story, Freddy kills people through their dreams. Pretty scary idea but it only works if the dream killer isn't gunning to be the king of the one liners Henny Youngman and if he isn't built like a jockey. Countless times we thought ""Dream me would beat the snot out of Freddy."" The execution of this one had the tantalyzing scent of a Full Moon production so obviously that created really b moments of the did they think nobody would notice that variety. A staple for enjoyable b. However, Jackie Earl Haley, mostly known for his roles as Kelly Leak and Steve Nash's stunt double, played Freddy. Right there the possibility for scares went out the window so despite some great b moments this was a boring flick.This movie needed to be really good to compete with the other horror remakes we've seen lately and it fell as short as The Reflections music career. Myers and Jason got scarier in the remakes and especially in Jason's case, by a lot. Freddy, on the other hand, was the Vachs of horror villians, supposed to be intimidating but just hilarious.

This one isn't an exception, it's a good anime film with wonderful art, animation and an imagination beyond limits. But although I love Miyazaki's work, this isn't one of his best works.For fleshing out his story he would need at least more half an hour of animation, there are too many loose ends or unexplained events in this film, and it deviates so much from the original novel that it's only very loosely based on it (and I sincerely think that it should be made that remark at the beginning or end of the movie).Compared with princess mononoke's characters, Sophie, Howl, Suliman or the Witch of the Waste are completely bi-dimensional! For example the Witch curses Sophie with a terribly monstrous curse with absolutely no reason (if she wanted a spy there would be millions of easier ways) and next time they meet they are almost friendly, Sophie asks her to remove the curse; the witch says she can't; then O.K. no big deal, let's help the poor overweight woman!!!! There is no consequence for the actions  formerly made. Also the Deux ex machina is quite abusive; especially the way Sophie finds Howls Castle.Many loose ends, if worked on, could had created a marvellous story. For example, Howl avoids at all costs being involved in the war, but for some unexplained reason he is always flying over the battlefields; this could lead to an excellent side plot but remains unexplored.It is a truly simple story, and very nice and uplifting tale; the image backgrounds are astonishing and the XIX century look mixed with magic and science is fantastic. But there is a lack of character motivations, too many coincidences, everybody is so simple, so good natured, everything can be worked out with a simple phrase ""lets be friends"" or a smile (from selling the soul, to loosing 60 years of life, almost being killed or ending a war!)...I believe you should watch this tale and be awed with the art, but not expecting a great story or unforgettable characters.",N/A

318188,"Although it was filmed during the first and memorable cycles of Universal horror films, WEREWOLF OF LONDON is hardly in the same league with DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, or THE BLACK CAT.  Simply put, it lacks imagination.The story opens with botanist Dr. Wilfred Glendon (Henry Hull) in search of a rare flowering plant in the wilds of Tibet--but although he secures a specimen, Glendon is bitten by a werewolf in the process.  Once more returned to his wife Lisa (Valerie Hobson) in London, Glendon is approached by Dr. Yogami (Warner Oland), who makes somewhat cryptic comments about the Tibet, the flower, and werewolves.  It soon transpires that Yogami is the werewolf that attacked Glendon in Tibet and that the flower is the only antidote.  Yogami steals the flowers, leaving Glendon to transform into a ravening beast that is driven to kill his own wife.The story itself is entertaining and Jack Pierce's make-up effects are quite good.  Warner Oland walks away with the acting honors and Spring Byington is not far behind.  But the rest of the cast is remarkably uninspired.  Henry Hull was a noted stage actor, but he simply did not play well on the screen.  In WEREWOLF OF LONDON he seems unduly stiff in some scenes and excessively ripe in others.  Valerie Hobson was a pleasant performer, but she is not particularly memorable here; Lester Matthews is utterly non-descript; and Ethel Griffies and Zeffie Tilbury quickly wear out their welcome in the roles of competing (and besotted) boarding house landladies.  Diector Stuart Walker's pacing seems clumsy and irregular, there is nothing interesting in the editing or designs.  The movie isn't bad enough to be truly bad, but neither is it good enough to be truly good--and it is mightily overshadowed by the later Lon Chaney Jr. film THE WOLF MAN.  Best left to hardcore fans of Universal Horror.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",N/A
1262142,"When I first read about this DVD I was excited to see some of the stuff on it. One of the segments I was really hyped to see was the grocery store brawl between Austin and Booker T. I received the DVD in the mail and sat down to watch it and boy was I disappointed. None of the segments are whole, its just highlights with different WWE stars talking about them. The matches are whole though(There are some matches that are just clips like the Kurt Angle/Brock Lesnar Iron Man match, Eddie Guerrero vs John Cena Parking lot brawl, and some others)The clips and full matches are done in a top 100 countdown style. Even though segments aren't whole, it is still a decent DVD though. I have to give this DVD 3 out 5 stars, Mostly because of the matches and some of the highlights they show are for segments and matches I totally forgot about(Like Tazz vs Triple H match) or, segments I enjoyed when I first saw them back in the day and it's fun to relive them. I recommend this DVD to wrestling fans but, I wouldn't spend more then 20 on it.","WWE: The Best of SmackDown - 10th Anniversary, 1999-2009"
950496,"I wanted to like this. I generally love Wes Craven. I generally love suspense. And while this was ""an action packed thrill ride"". It was a very flawed movie.I did enjoy it. It's not by any means unwatchable, but it is implausible to the point where I couldn't stop laughing at the insane twists by the end of the film. Unfortunately, since the first 2/3 or so of the film were set up so well - very gritty, realistic, suspenseful, and very evocative of helplessness, that made the last part of the movie that much stupider. Suddenly we've gone from a creditable Hitchcock pastiche to a Warner Brothers cartoon. If it had been goofy all the way through, it would have been better than switching styles in mid-stream.Also, while I like Wes Craven, he's got some serious issues - for one thing, the main two characters look AND ACT almost exactly like Sydney and Billy from Scream, and the dichotomy (she good/he bad) is identical, it just becomes clear a lot earlier. Wes needs to play with his own stereotypes and make a BAD brunette GIRL for a change.RED EYE is the kind of movie that fails, but has enough talent and good charm. It tries hard with very little and in the end will probably be considered one the most riveting and yet forgettable movies of 2005.",N/A

But Roger Corman's Sharktopus has a gut-level fascination that compelled me to see what it was about. The cover art reminds you of the 60s B-flicks of which Corman was such a staple of quick and prolific.S-11 is a shark/octopus hybrid created as a killing machine for the navy. Remember Barf in Spaceballs -- half man, half dog, I'm my own best friend; and in Matinee John Goodman picking up a rubber alligator, ""Manigator, Alliman...?"" You have to put the analytic critic in the back seat and just enjoy the ride. The sharktopus is a fascinating creation that fills the screen with surprisingly well-rendered graphics in and out of the water. The movie keeps you wanting to see more of the monster, if only to check out its moves. And the appearances aren't stingy like most monster movies.The story doesn't require too much analysis. Experimental beast loses it's control mechanism, going renegade. Most of the people will end up as shark-bait, so there isn't a surplus of characterization to the munchy morsels along the way. The mercenary and inventor's daughter who hunt down the beast don't exhibit the typically credible human emotions of fear around a morsel-munching shark that just as easily tentacles it's way on land as in the deep. It's a pretty wild ride with high body count and pretty graphic crunchy splatter effects, it that's your thing. Not appropriate for kids. The feeling is SciFi made-for TV movie, not on the same level with Jurrasic Park, Cloverfield, or the recent King Cong.",N/A
436105,"""Are You Being Served? The Movie"" had enormous potential; sadly the film didn't manage to reach that potential. Instead of putting our favorite staff members from Grace Bros. into new situations Lloyd and Croft simply re-worked several former episodes, such as ""A Change is as Good as a Rest"" and ""Dear Sexy Knickers."" Add to this the oft-used-in-the-series plot device of the closing of the store and the staff going on holiday (in this case to Costa Plonka), paid for by the Head of the Firm Young Mr. Grace; though they used this idea of the store closing for renovations and Young Mr. Grace copping for the staff to go on holiday in the interim a couple of times in the series, they never actually did an episode where we actually saw the staff on holiday, thus it could have worked in the Movie if done differently.Nevertheless the first half of the film is fairly good in spite of the re-used gags and plot-devices; we get to see a bit more of the store, such as a view of the Ladies' and Gents' Dept. from the lift looking down the stairs (a view which if memory serves we never got to see in the series); the photo booth; and the Continental Beauty Salon-though where was the famed Madame Beryl? I'm not sure how the film, containing these re-worked plot elements, would fit into a timeline of the series. Perhaps the producers Lloyd and Croft were trying to appeal to audiences unfamiliar with the series.The abscence of a laugh track was interesting, though admittedly a laugh track might have helped the film which drags during much of the hotel scenes. Great potential, but the film just didn't deliver; Lloyd and Croft are capable of much better. Unfortunately ""Are You Being Served? the Movie"" is just dead common. Of course it was great seeing our favorite dept. store staff in a feature film, so if you're a serious fan of the show you'll want this, otherwise you should probably skip it.

Several friends told me how their sides hurt from laughing so hard after seeing it in the theater, and the folk music subject interested me.

132323,"Tour Hawaii with Elvis Presley!!!  That's a pretty good description of this musical, the success of which marked the end of the singer's attempts  at being a serious actor.  For what it is--a travelogue with music and a  slight plot--it isn't bad at all.  But &quot;King Creole,&quot;  &quot;Flaming Star,&quot; and even &quot;Follow That Dream&quot;  demonstrated that Elvis could indeed act when given half the chance.  That's all &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; is, though:  half a chance.  The songs  aren't exactly rock and roll, but most provide pleasant listening, and, of  course, this is the movie that introduced the lovely &quot;Can't Help  Falling in Love,&quot; the song with which he would end all of his concerts  in the 70s.  Angela Lansbury is on hand as Elvis' mother, even though she  was only a few years older than him (just as she was only a few years older  than Laurence Harvey when she played his mother in &quot;The Manchurian  Candidate&quot; the next year, a movie in which Elvis might just as well  have been cast considering his apparent manipulation at the hands of  Colonel Parker), and, of course, there are plenty of luscious babes about  for those who don't consider Angela a turn on.  &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; is  a real mixed bag.  It is, perhaps, the very definition of  &quot;fluff,&quot; and as fluff it is attractive, but it would ultimately  lead to dozens of execrable imitations that would make Presley's movie  career one of the most lamentable in history.

If you make eye contact or he otherwise telepathically hunts you down, you're his minion.  Unfortunately, the movie was half good.  The awake scenes were somewhat slow and discontinuous; the story jumped around and things happened without any particular logical sequence.  The dream scenes, on the other hands, were very cool.  Comparisons to Hell Raiser are somewhat accurate, although Hell Raiser was much more graphically and violently intense than this film is.  Dreamers are in this surreal world populated by fiendish demon-like creatures who flit around, obviously stalking their prey - very creepy.

1556651,"This is a heartwarming tale of a Somali pirate who finally realizes his dream of coming to America.Throughout the movie he says to himself, if he is strong and believes in himself (paraphrase), everything will turn out right. And it does. Kind of.OK. Seriously, though. First, be aware that this film may be a whitewash of the real Captain Phillips; his crew says they in fact warned him repeatedly about entering pirated waters, but he ignored them. And so on. I don't know whom to believe, but just FYI.Second, the good Captain does things which don't make sense. He ignores the warning of his crew that the first encounter will be followed-up, and they should haul, er, butt. He says if they do, they'll run into other pirates anyway. This decision allows the pirates to catch up. Then, after telling the crew to hide and under no circumstances be captured to be held hostage, he stays on the bridge and ... is held hostage.Third, he is constantly saying things to his captors which would probably irritate them rather than calm them down. Look for these nuggets. I cringed each time.Otherwise, this film is suspenseful, not exactly action-packed, but thrilling nevertheless. This is due in no small part to the actors who play the wild-eyed pirates, looking scary as all get-out. You see how they're recruited into a ruthless, greedy pirate ring, constantly demanding and yelling and threatening. You feel a bit sorry for them.They say they're forced into this life because of big fishing boats which get all their fish. I don't know if this is true or not. But they apparently use this as their excuse for violence and theft.You get to see how comedically useless the ""non-lethal"" defenses of a big ship are against pirates - they blithely weave in between water jets and shoot open pirate cages.And we sympathize with the crew, who complain that they are unarmed against dangerous thugs. We can pontificate all day about how un-nice it is to have armed security on ships, but I guarantee the day you spot a skiff of armed criminals on course with your ship, you'll be wishing you had a bazooka - certainly after watching this team of khat-addled goons.You'll see the full force of the US Navy swing into action to rescue this one man. And you'll make no mistake - these are the good guys. And consummate professionals, carrying out what seems a convoluted plan (what's that with making big wakes, stopping the tow, etc.?).There is more waiting than I had expected. There is Jason Bourne Jerky-Cam in the lifeboat, which might make you seasick. Nothing actually happens a lot of the time there, just some threatening and panicking. The Captain's interactions with the pirates there seem somewhat random and without any real plan, except to apparently antagonize them more.There is a semi-happy ending, as the pirate team lead, Muse, makes his way to the United States.I enjoyed it, but it's not a five-star movie to me.

Appearing to be a stellar cast, it is not shown by their performances. Robert DeNiro overacted a bit, Harvey Keitel was typical, Ray Liotta tried hard to imitate what he did during Goodfellas, and Sylvester Stallone didn't look right. On the other hand, Robert Patrick was great. At one interesting point, it was the Raging Bull meeting Rocky. I know the intensity is there during Cop Land, but the story, having a good deal of potential, was falling apart. At the same time, the logic wasn't there because the ending, to me, should have turned out to be different because there is no way that the sheriff would have finked to Ray, kept Superboy in the cell without alerting the NYPD or anyone else for that matter, and be dumb enough to have no backup in the morning prior to taking Superboy out. At least, Cop Land was watchable. There is a rip-off ending of Above the Law with the saying ""No one is above the law"" from Nixon's quotes. However, that climactic scene was pretty dramatic.",N/A

1130639,"A lot of romantic comedies follow an incredibly rigid formula. Guy will meet girl and they fall in love but guy does something stupid which breaks it up and while both are trying to move on, guy decides to do something embarassing/public which will win her heart. However occasionally a film will come along that at least plays with the conventions but either doesn't do it sufficiently enough or some story things just feel wrong for the tone. Dan in Real Life is that kind of film where it doesn't deal with romance in a way-too-common manner but what it does with it doesn't work either.Dan Burns is an advice columnist and single dad to 3 daughters after their mom died four years ago. Travelling to family reunion, Dan meets Anne-Marie, a charming woman that Dan almost instantly connects with and is excited at its prospects. Upon returning back to the house he gets a surprise when his brother Mitch is in a relationship with none other than Marie and the family is more than ecstatic with the pairing. With her always around and his own family on the rocks, Dan has to hide his feelings even when Marie shows signs she cares for him as well.I can very much relate with Dan since on more than one occasion I've had feelings for a woman that unfortunately is unavailable (and strangely involved with the poorest excuse for a guy in town) but I never had a family that seems so nasty as this one. Scheduling a blind date with a girl they remember having a slight ""pig-like"" face, the family proceeds to crack jokes and even sing a song that seems more demeaning and teasing than a family affair. Even though it's a romantic comedy, the family seems almost intentionally mean at times and it's almost depressing to watch considering what Dan has to be around.Plus the dynamic between Dan and Marie (helped by the good chemistry they have) doesn't seem to go beyond that bookstore meaning and whereas Mitch is clearly not the right guy, going as far as to use pre-written lines - by Dan, of course - Dan and Marie have one big bonding scene where they can get along before the world crashes down around him and he spends a good time skulking. But at least the acting is generally solid all around, including the actresses who play Dan's daughters while Dane Cook is probably his least irritating though he seems like he's just playing a tamer version of other roles he's played or even a tamer Dane Cook.I would recommend watching the film since it's at least different than those Matthew McConaughey/Kate Hudson-type rom-coms but on the other hand, I appreciate Dan in Real Life for what it wanted to do but I can't based on what it did.",N/A

The singing, acting, and - in the way that hollywood makes things so stupidly explicit - the plot.

For that, it was nearly terrible.  What the production did convey extremely well - hence 3 and not 2 stars - was the dance.  It made me want to dance and I was in awe of the talent there, which may be one reason why the actors were largely unknowns and, frankly, so bad at everything else.  I did enjoy talking about it with my daughter and it is toned down somewhat.If you want to re-experience the bway show, don't get this.  It can't really stand on its own either, but isn't a total bomb.",N/A

632365,"It begins and ends with the deaths of key persons in the life of oceanographer Steve Zissou, a sort of underfunded Jacques Cousteau. His career needs the boost it gets when a young man who actually is his son joins a voyage of vengeance (think ""Jaws"" or ""Moby Dick""). They set out to kill the shark that ate his partner at the beginning. Father and son fall for an unmarried pregnant reporter also on board (don't ask). There is a shipboard kidnapping and deadly shoot-outs on board and on a deserted island. This is a comedy. No kidding.Yes, we are sailing in waters in which the imaginative director. Wes Anderson, has charted a course badly in need of a compass. It is the weakest of his films (""Rushmore,"" ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."") In it we await the moment when all the entertaining bits and pieces come together in a satisfying way, only to have it end before that moment arrives. That we are willing to stay with it testifies to the sly charm of those bits and pieces and Anderson's skill with them.In the title role, the reliable Bill Murray tries so hard to appear not to be acting that he actually doesn't. That leaves a hole in the movie that the other actors, most of whom like Murray have worked with Anderson before, are unable to fill. Cate Blanchett, Owen Wilson, Angelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, Bud Cort, how can you go wrong with a cast like that? Apparently, you can. Even when your movie is given a two-disc DVD transfer by the standard-setting Criterion Collection.""The Life Acquatic With Steve Zissou"" boasts a city block-long cutaway of the ship ""Belafonte"" (a wink at Cousteau's ship ""Calypso."") There is some clever animation, and original songs by David Bowie are sung in Portugese throughout. But these flourishes are not enough to invigorate the humor or quicken the pace. Anderson is a true auteur, a treasure really, who writes and directs his own ideas instead of adapting other work to the screen. Given his excellent track record, we can cut him some slack on this one.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
1576509,"This is about the DVD's only; I have never read the books!If you love Harry Potter and have seen the other films you'd likely give this 5 stars.  First you need to see part one of &#34;THE DEATHLY HALLOWS&#34; before you watch this.  As a stand alone (that is: &#34;THE DEATHLY HALLOWS&#34; parts I & II) These films are 'dark' and a bit depressing [much like Frodo going into Mordor and Mt. Doom].  Thus the reason I give 3 stars.  The good part of it being so dark is that it is not the normal Hollywood story and ending.  I say: &#34;Film Noir is- 'Nohting good will ever come from this.&#34;  Maybe good triumphs but all will be scarred for life and will always have a black stain they carry with them.If the day comes that you are ready to watch the Harry Potter films You should watch all 8 films in a quick succession [say, one each night for 8 nights.  Most will be glad that they did.REVIEW:  &#34;THE DEATHLY HALLOWS- I & II&#34; are a dark tale which starts with 3 brothers cheating death at a place called the Deathly Hallows.  Death gives them 3 gifts- like a Djinn gives gifts.  When this part of the film come into play the Deathly Hallows, part, is as told like/as a fairy tale.  Then we jump to some future time.  We meet a disturbed guy- Tom Riddle.  Tom decides that he is best suited to rule the world- wizards, normal humans, and half breeds.  In his paranoia he puts bits of his essence into objects 'horcruxes'. Thus if he is killed there remains a link to the world, so that he can come back.We see Tom's (aka: Lord Voldemort)followers attempt to bring all of the horcruxes together.  This will allow him to achieve full form and power.  And to find the 3 peaces of the Deathly hallows, so that he may cheat death. As Tom's force gain power and size through terror they show their Progressive philosophy (We know about how to make a perfect society and world, you don't.  So, you shut up, sit back, and let us have our way.  All will be perfect and happy when we're done.)Their adversary's are &#34;The Order Of the Phoenix&#34; Which includes Harry Potter and friends.  Harry and friends decide that their action is to hunt and destroy horcruxes. As they are off searching, the battle between good and evil is going to take place at Hogwarts's.This DVD has my second favorite Harry Potter scene:  the Griffindor sword/dragon scene at Gringold's.The final battle takes place, many are lost, much is destroyed, and an outcome is achieved.If you don't like or want to see Harry Potter Then don't watch.  If you'd like to see Harry Potter then Watch it in order [over a short period of time].  &#34;THE DEATHLY HALLOWS- I & II&#34;, are dark and close to depressing.  Definitely no Hollywood story or ending here!  All of the series are top notch in: acting, directing, script, plot, story, ...The order:1- H. P. and the sorcerer's stone2- The Chamber of Secrets3- The Prisoner of Azkaban4- The Goblet of Fire5- The Order of the Phoenix  [scene 29 best scene in series]6- The Half Blood Prince  [probably my favorite]7 & 8- &#34;THE DEATHLY HALLOWS- I & II&#34;",N/A

Amy Adams plays a very stoic person so contrary to what she usually does.  PSH is perfection in his role as the guru with the gift of gab.

It seems that whomever has the rights now doesn't care about the series and has no understanding of the massive Xena fan base that has been hoping for years for someone to lovingly restore Xena and re-release a box set.

495366,"I originally saw this movie in the early 80's when I was an impressionable child.  It was one of those notorious films that kids whispered about--one filled with plenty of nudity and brutality.  Along with ""Last House on the Left"" and ""Faces of Death,"" ""I Spit On Your Grave"" exemplified exploitation cinema.  I didn't particularly like the movie--even then I appreciated the finer arts.  But based on its reputation and its controversial history, I knew I wanted to include this title in my extensive DVD library.  Heck, it must be better than I remembered to have a Deluxe Millennium edition!Well, in truth, it is better than I remembered.  The amateurish quality lends it a gritty realism that actually works in the film's favor.  Over the last couple of decades, we've become a little less sensitized to violence--some of our biggest hits are basically torture movies (think ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"").  So while the rape scenes are still quite disturbing, they are somehow less shocking.  More astounding, Camille Keaton's performance is actually quite accomplished.  Her reactions and subsequent revenge play out quite well.Some claim this film as a feminist treatise, and some as vile female degradation.  It's actually a bit of both--but I don't think the film merits a serious philosophical discussion.  Either way, it was meant to assault your senses--and that it does.Mind you, I'm not claiming ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is a great movie.  But it is essential viewing for those interested in this genre.  And for my money, it has held up better than ""Last House On The Left""--although I do prefer the plot of ""Last House"".A film entitled ""I Spit On Your Grave"" isn't for everyone.  So don't let the charming title fool you, this isn't one for the whole family.  KGHarris, 10/06.",N/A

Mind you, this is a commentary only on the episodes this DVD, not the rest of the series.- The ending with the kisses. Ruined it for me, really. There should have been no kissing, it just added kitschiness to the whole ending and felt forced.- Plot inconsistencies within the last few episodes (Ember Island Players, Southern Raiders) It feels to me that the writers simply weren't paying attention and didn't care to tighten up the plot.- Many questions left unanswered. The fate of Ursa? Long Feng? The Earth King? The White Lotus? Chit Sang? Teo? Again, it feels like the writers got sloppy. Tsk tsk...Other than that, the eps were decent. Good animation, and plot holes aside, there were humorous/memorable moments. So overall, when you add the good stuff and bad stuff, this particular set of episodes gets 3/5 stars.

913378,"""Ashanti"" has loads going for it: Released in 1979, it was directed by Richard Fleischer and stars Michael Caine with an impressive supporting cast, including Peter Ustinov, Omar Shariff, William Holden and Rex Harrison (the latter three in very minor roles). If you're into exotic women there's Beverly Johnson, not to mention great exotic locations -- Israel, Kenya and Sicily (although much of the story takes place in the Sahara Desert). Caine's co-star, Kabir Bedi, is impressive as well.The story addresses modern-day slavery. Caine's black wife is apprehended by slave-traders and he chases them across the Sahara Desert all the way to the Red Sea. I know of two beautiful women who completely disappeared abroad. What happened to them? Were they apprehended by slavers? Did they become sex slaves? No one knows. The film illustrates this very-real possibility.""Ashanti"" plays like a wannabe ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but doesn't even come close. It's marred by a horribly dated 70s score whereas the score to ""Lawrence"" is timeless (even though it's older by about 17 years!!). Plus, ""Lawrence"" is believable from beginning to end, whereas I found myself mumbling ""Yeah, right"" numerous times while watching ""Ashanti."" In other words, too many scenes come off unconvincing or slightly awkward.BOTTOM LINE: ""Ashanti"" sounds great on paper but they needed to take more time in the creation process to work out the kinks in the writing, acting, directing and score.Still, the locations are great, there is a lot of action and the film provokes thought on an important subject. It's definitely worth picking up if you're a Caine fan or if you're into desert-survival flicks, especially since it's so cheap. Same thing if you favor Beverly Johnson (who's not the greatest actress). It's quite a bit better than caine's similar African adventure ""The Wilby Conspiracy"" (1975).The dvd features only a full screen version but the picture is quite good. Unfortunately the menu is cheap, featuring only ""Play Movie"" and ""Trailer;"" there isn't even a scene selection option.GRADE: C",N/A
56381,"The second of Oliver Stone's three films on the subject of Vietnam, this one stars Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic, a wounded war vet who comes home to discover the grateful reception he expected isn't waiting for him. Though the film is closely based on a true story, it also functions as a rather obvious metaphor for the rapid transition of America's public attitude from the happy-go-lucky family values of the '50s to the conspiratorial uncertainty of the early '70s. At the time this was something of a reach for Cruise, who was only just starting to branch out into serious roles, and the strong performance opened up new horizons for his career. His acting shines, especially in the dark, depressing pits to which his character eventually sinks, but the storyline could use some smoothing. Almost overnight Kovic's attitudes about his country spin 180-degrees, swapping one extreme perspective for another just minutes after he's shouted down his younger brother over the kitchen table for doing the same thing. An awkward almost-love-story is shoehorned into his character arc, then disappears around the middle of the picture and never resurfaces. It's a passionate rallying cry for the cause of the railroaded, confused Vietnam vets who were punished for doing what they thought was the right thing, but despite several strong performances from its cast it's needlessly long and routinely uneven.",N/A

701728,"First of all, I have to point out that I am a fan of the original twenty-six episode series, which I consider to be an absolutely stunning production and story, with a slightly disjointed ending.That said, I admittedly watched this with an existing bias.As a movie in its own right, this is very nice; compared to the original series it was adapted from, it's a bit of a let down. The production standards were excellent (after all, it appears to use the same cast and crew as the original series), but to somebody who had already experienced the richness of the original, the retelling was rather abrupt.In my opinion, it is best to consider this to be an alternative history type of tale, that happens to feature many of the same characters. The storyline only bears a superficial resemblance to that of the original, but it's a decent storyline in its own right. If I had seen this before watching the series, I would probably have considered it a 4 of 5 overall.Character designs are nice, and the animation is excellent. The sound quality seems to be very good, but they don't seem to be trying for the immersive audio experience of the series. I cannot comment on the quality of the dub work (didn't listen to it) but considering the company, it's probably decent. Acting on the Japanese audio is excellent, and, if I'm recalling names correctly, features the same cast as the series. The subtitles are nicely legible, although I was watching it on a 31&quot; display using an S-Video hookup.I can't comment on the extra features available, as I've only seen a rental edition (no bonus disc included), but the extra features on the main disc are minimal.",N/A

1388849,"This is a film where the characters outperform the plot.It's definitely not for the masses, and it can be more appreciated over time after analyzing it, but certainly won't be if you view it as a ""popcorn flick"" going into it.This movie is NOT for you if:- you can't stand heavy-dialogue and slow pacing- expect to see a crime drama and see what clever way or twist on how they pulled it off (the film has to do more about hypocrisy/fate/religion and spirituality...or at least tries to be deep)- you hate abrupt endings that make you go ""Huh?""- you get offended about religious topics- you get offended seeing nudity and sex (Milla Jovovich is clearly topless a few times)- you expect to have a fun movie night with your friends/family (this is simply not that kind of thriller); if you expect action or edge-of-your-seat moments and twists after twists, this is NOT it. This is not anything powerful likeAmerican History XorThe Shawshank Redemption- you don't want to feel uncomfortable or low. There really is no real uplifting humor. No characters to really cheer for or like. Lots of arguing and depressing themes.This is a very unsettling dark film and I don't really mean that as a praise either. This is NOT a feel-good film; I don't mean just the tone and the theme, but the movie itself and the ending.If you watch the trailer for this movie, it gives the whole plot away. Seriously. (by the way, although the trailer makes it out to be this fast-paced thriller, it is definitely NOT. It's a very misleading trailer) If you're into the psychology of the characters, or trying to figure out what the director is trying to say, then there may still be some ""entertainment"" left for you to enjoy.The ending feels quite of a cop-out. It seems like the writers didn't know how to end it. I do get what they tried to do with the connection and the whole message about the bee and the noise, but I do feel cheated sitting through that whole film and not know what would happen to the characters next. It just leaves it too hanging and unsatisfying.It's a little ridiculous and hard to believe that De Niro, the parole officer, on his way to retirement - and a veteran - knowing fully well he should not be talking to the convict's wife in the first place, still involves himself with her in that manner. I wish the writers would have thought of something better because I think he gave in way too easily just so SOMETHING could finally happen in the film. (I mean, who would even trust eating a raw egg from a convict's wife?! What if that was poisoned?! Hello?)People will love it or hate this film. I think for the former to happen, you would have to really sit down and really listen to all the dialogue, and watch it more than once carefully. I think on an entertainment level, it fails. I think viewing it a second time and trying to think deeper about the psychology of the characters is where it may, or may not, get interesting; but that's more of what the audience will have to fill-in and not exactly what the movie itself will show to the audience clearly.It feels a little TV-drama to me with lots of talking heads back and forth in the office or prison. To me, it was a little distracting that the film used major stars because for some reason, I couldn't help watch the film the whole time without thinking I'm just watching De Niro and Norton on screen. I mean, De Niro was just De Niro. Edward Norton put some more effort into his character, but I still couldn't help it but see Stone's character as Edward Norton just acting. (When I was watching American History X, the story and dialogue was so engaging, I lost the Norton distraction and just saw that film of him as the character). I mean, it definitely does take a veteran cast to perform and sell those dialogues without coming out too cheesy or unbelievable.The extras on the DVD is really lousy. I'm surprised this DVD doesn't even have a director's commentary because it really could have used one, and I would have been interested to hear it.The first time I watched it, I hated the film. It grew on me the second time I watched it. Overall, I give it a 6/10. It's probably more interesting to analyze the theme or characters of this film than to watch the movie again. It is not your typical mindless Hollywood film, but at the same time, it's not a good source of ""entertainment"" either. It is a depressing film.Besides the performance, the main entertainment of this film is really in the dialogues. This movie is for you if you're into paying attention carefully to every dialogue and not so much on the plot; you'll notice subtle things like reoccurring lines like De Niro's character saying ""You don't think I'll do it"" in the beginning of the film when he's young (they sure found a good look alike!) and near the end.",Stone

199472,"This is such a bizarre movie.  I find it alternatively touching, poignant, annoying and ridiculously funny depending on how I look at it.  First of all, the plot has so many holes you could drive a tank through them.  Let's see, somehow all the forests on Earth were destroyed and a decision was made to save them by planting huge tracts of forests in gigantic geodesic domes mounted on spacecraft out around Saturn.  Eight years later they decide to destroy all the domes with nuclear bombs and bring the ships back to Earth.  Forget about the insane amount of money and effort it would take to set this up in the first place, forget about leaving the forests in their domes under the care of drones, let's blow them up.  The whole plot makes no sense.But it's as an un-intentional parody of an environmental fanatic that Bruce Dern, as Freeman Lowell, really shines in this movie.  Start out with the sacharine sweet scene of 'ol martyr Lowell in white robes hoeing his garden and feeding Mr. Friendly rabbit to the strains of a Joan Baez tune to open the movie and you know all you need to know about where this flick is going.  Gee, does it have a message?And I dare anyone not to laugh after watching sanctimoniuos Lowell arguing with his shipmates, then stalking off to one of the domes in a huff in his white robe and, get this, when he gets there, he raises his hand and an eagle lands on it.  I horked soda out of my nose on that scene, it was so unbelievably funny.Yet somehow Bruce as Lowell also portrays the selfish environmental movement perfectly.  Lowell kills his shipmates to save the trees.  Rich Western environmentalists discover that DDT if used indiscriminately is bad for birds and ban it in all it's uses, thus consigning millions upon millions of poor Africans and Asians to horrible death by malaria over the next 40 years.  Millions of dead people, but at least rich environmentalists can go on eco-tours and see all the pretty plumage on the parrots.  Yeah, there's a message there.And when good 'ol Lowell flees and can't figure out why his forest is dying, it's almost too good to be true.  Showing the bone-headedness of a truly committed environmentalist, he can't figure out that running away from the sun means less light, and less light means dead plants.To it's credit, there are some cool things about this movie.  The set, the special effects (in 1971 no less) and the drones are totally cool.  If you can forget the heavy-handed ""message"", the middle of the movie is pretty good, especially Lowell's reprogramming of the drones to save his sanity and the ship after running through Saturn's rings.And it ends well, sort of.  Lowell blows himself up, martyr to the end, rather than going back to Earth, and the last geodesic dome slides off into space with it's forest under the care of one of the drones.  So at least somewhere out there, Mr, Friendly Rabbit still eats Lowell's crops to the strains of sanctimonious Joan Baez tunes.",N/A

Being from Ohio and knowing lots of folks who played music in its bars, I was hoping for far more than what I found in LIGHT OF DAY.The biggest problem I had was casting: Michael J. Fox, looking to shed his Marty McFly and Alex Keaton image, never convinces me that he's a hard-rocking bar buster from Cleveland.  I always thought Keifer Sutherland could've pulled it off better.But I love Joan Jett in this movie.  I believe every frame of her performance.  The scene where she explains to Fox why she's into music (while ridiculing the posers frying out on drugs nearby) is great.I thought the identity of the father of her child was a cop-out and detracted from the drama of the final scenes.LIGHT OF DAY is still a cool 80's movie.  Filmed in Cleveland.  Snapshots of Midwest living.  And I liked how the band, at their day job pressing commerative plates, see the times change with each changing image from their presses.I just wish it was what it was shooting for.",N/A

1080761,"There were plenty of times where this was a 2 star film and only a few when it was four stars but overall it comes in as a 3 minus. The idea is interesting, Viking conflict with American Indians but it's done in such an over the top manner, any historical point is lost. The Vikings are dressed like Fantasy figures and act with no logic what-so-ever. There is lots of gore and it's all done in the darkest of shades so that it often looks like night-time. I kept thinking that there was clearly a budget of sorts available and that it was a shame that it was spent making a sort of Dark Ages 'teen slasher'. While most of it is cliched (as much as the film defies genre classification) and sometimes almost stupid in terms of believability, there are a few surprises and I guess it is generally adequate for killing time when there is nothing else available.",N/A
1433262,"Long, long, long time Gundam fan here, [...].  I have the honor of being born the same year (actually one week before) the first Gundam series premiered in Japan.  I have been a huge fan since I was a wee tyke.  I was very impressed with Gundam Seed and Gundam 00 (we won't mention Gundam Seed Destiny which was pretty much a nearly exact repeat of Seed, just with a few new faces).  I actually hesitate to give this three stars, because I think that is too high of a rating.  But being that it still holds true to the Gundam roots, I'll keep it at 3.To give a little back story to the production; Seiji Mizushima, the regular director of Gundam 00 and Fullmetal Alchemist was brought in to write and direct this film.  Sunrise gave him license to do what he thought best as long as he kept true to the anti-war message of the series and used the characters that were still around at the end of the series.  Perhaps Sunrise forgot that Bones let him have free reign for a Fullmetal Alchemist film and we were given the awfulness that was Conqueror of Shamballa.In this film, a ship from Jupiter is headed towards a crash landing on Earth.  The new Earth Federation forces destroy it, but fragments crash to Earth and begin taking over machines, trying to kill anyone who has Quantum brain waves.  Ala Maximum Overdrive (terrible 80s flick with killer machines - led by Optimus Prime - I mean a big, killer 18 wheeler).  Then we see a zombie version of an early Innovator (who looks like Ribbons).  Then we find out that the fragments actually contained alien life forms from Jupiter.  They get pissed and amass a fleet to conquer Earth.  First wave is stopped and so a second, meaner fleet comes from Jupiter towards Earth.  Since they are seemingly brainless, all they do is kill.  But wait, they're misunderstood and all we need is Setsuna to talk with them, then all will be well.The problem is that this film never really becomes cohesive.  One of the brilliant aspects of ANY and EVERY Gundam series is that it comes together nicely in the end.  Everything ends up weaving together.  The characters end up pivotal to the story.  The viewer roots for them.  In this film we never really get that feeling of 'everything coming together'.  I'll elaborate in a second.The second main issue, which stems from the first issue is the lack of a central villain.  Gundam has ALWAYS featured insanely maniacal and really interesting villains.  From Char to Rau Le Creuset (whose family was in the pots and pans business - Le Creuset! - but j/k).  In this series I actually thought Shaman might end up as the 'villain' but alas... instead we have the Borg like metal lifeforms which seem to act as a hive mind and don't really communicate.  At least not to the extent to where the viewer gets treated to insane monologues like Rau or Ribbons give as they try to eradicate all life.  The lack of entertaining villains is a huge minus for me.The other issue with the 'villain' from this film is that when your favorite supporting characters start dying, you think ""well crap, they outlasted the Innovators and survived against insane villains such as Ali-Al-Saachez but they got owned by unexciting little metal cones"".  And what's even a greater transgression is when some of these characters show up then get killed right away.  It really does lessen the impact of the death of a character you knew for several dozen episodes of the main season.  In fact, we hear that over 70% of the fleet is taken out by the midway of the battle.  And against little metal aliens.  The most interesting part is when the aliens actually start forming Gundam shaped entities to better combat the Federation.But most of the battles consist of hundreds of CG cones following a Gundam in a row, looking a lot like the line of seagulls from Finding Nemo chasing a fish.  When there are multiple mobile suits on screen and hundreds of these aliens, the battles form a mish mash of lasers, streams of aliens, and explosions.  I would have preferred the battles to run more like the amazing Zaft vs Earth Forces battles in SEED (like the one where Flay's dad gets it) or the battles between Celestial Being and the A-Laws in 00.  Even the finale battle in 00 was watchable, despite the high number of objects.I won't spoil what happens, but the ending is kind of disappointing, though if you roll through the credits you get the anti-war message.  Which is actually printed on screen.  Something like ""Peace cannot be maintained through force, but only by understanding"".  I loved the message, I just wish that I had enjoyed getting there a bit more.The mobile suit designs are hit and miss.  Celestial Being's suits are rather lackluster.  The idea of the 'rifle bits' for Lockon's new suit was good, but the weird floating wing was odd.  Hallelujah's Gundam was interesting with the double cockpit, but it was a boxy version of Kyrios and Arios.  Setsuna gets 00 for most of the series, and his new suit looks like a copy of Exia with a small backpack.  It seems the more creative suits are being designed for Gundam AGE (though not character design apparently - zing!).The intro song is amazing.  I would expect nothing less from UVERworld.  Then ending song is... eh.  It seems the singer rushes the song to cram in too many syllables.  But there is a pretty good insert song near the end of the series.  I did enjoy that.Now it seems I am bashing the film, but I'm not completely.  It is still an entertaining film, albeit it deviates from the 'style' of Gundam.  It does remind me quite a bit of what the director did with the Fullmetal film, just going off on a weird tangent.  Perhaps a plot with dissidents planning to overthrow the Federation government and acquiring a new Gundam (piloted by an evil and maniacal Innovator) would have been interesting.  Hell, they could have cloned an evil Aeolia Schenberg and put him in a new Gundam and I would have been more impressed.  It was just hard to watch my favorite characters battling a lackluster enemy.I do also understand that the message was about gaining 'understanding' with beings completely different than humans.  But by the end of the film I didn't care anymore.  The 'villains' were so lackluster that as a viewer I just wanted them all dead.  I didn't want understanding.Oh, by the way, for the 'misunderstood life form' style anime, Eureka Seven pulls it off PERFECTLY.All in all a decent Gundam flick with plenty of action but very little plot.  As a sequel to Gundam 00 it fails on many levels.  It seemed to drag down the high we all had when Celestial Being destroyed Ribbons and the false Innovators.  Perhaps this director should stick to directing series and stay out of the feature length animated film segment.  I feel that might be best.  But if you liked Gundam 00, you might want to watch it.  If you would hate to see a few good characters get killed in silly battles then you might not want to watch it.----Update: I just read Ender's Game, and this movie seems to have borrowed liberally from that novel.

911003,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a relationship with someone of a different race? Better yet, have you imagined what would happen when you introduced your significant other to your parents? This is the backdrop for this movie, a comedy with some funny moments mixed together with a script that is mostly predictable.This movie is similar to the 1967 classic, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and many viewers who enjoyed that movie will want to compare this movie to it. In ""Guess Who"", the same situation is presented, except this time a black woman played by actress Zoe Saldana is bringing home a white man, played by Ashton Kutcher, to meet her parents. Tensions are felt all around, but the person who is most uneasy is Percy Jones, played by actor Bernie Mac. He claims that it doesn't bother him, but he continues to look for ways to break his daughter and her fianc&eacute; up, even though he has always told his kids that they should be color blind and accepting of all people.While Bernie Mack is struggling with his acceptance of his daughter's new boyfriend, he is also trying to plan a party where he and his wife (played by Judith Scott) will renew their wedding vows. Toward the end of the film, his wife gets upset at him and it looks like the party is off. Now, it is up to him to apologize and win back his wife's affections. It is here, at this point, that he realizes how much his wife means to him and how much his daughter means to her boyfriend. This subplot is, again, mostly predictable. But it at least fits into the movie's theme and keeps the movie flowing.Bernie Mack, Zoe Saldana, and Judith Scott are all pretty good in this film and they have a good grip on their respective roles and the personification of their characters. My only reservations are with Ashton Kutcher, who plays the role of Simon Green. His performance seems a little off the mark and the chemistry between him and Zoe Saldana wasn't quite there. Saldana throws her heart into the role, but Kutcher seems like he doesn't rally want to be here.Overall, this film is a good one and it does have some good comedic moments. Its greatest flaws are its predictability and formula- driven script. But I liked it enough to recommend. Bernie Mac's comedic talent alone is worth giving this movie a watch.",N/A

1622486,"Kids on the Slope is a coming of age story by the same team behind anime classic cowboy bebop. The story focuses on the friendship between Kaoru and Sentaro. Kaoru is a bookish nerdy guy new to school who meets rough streetwise Sentaro. While the the two couldn't be anymore different they form a bond over jazz music. Set in 1966 Japan the anime is filled with musical references to not just jazz but pop music (the Beatles for example) that was current for the time.The anime reminded me a lot of John Knowles ""a separate peace"" where Kaoru's character has some paranoia and jealousy about the relationships around him. Over the course of the series we see their friendship tested over girls, music and social pressure.My only real complaint was the English dub. While the main characters are good the portrayal of supporting character Seiji is offensive. The character is artsy. In the English dub Sentai has decided to depict him as a gay stereotype completed with lisp, high pitched and overly effeminate voice all while uttering things like ""fabulous"" and ""fierce"". This type of performance is no more acceptable than old cartoons that depicted Asian characters with heavy accents saying ""you want much tasty fried lice?"". I watched the Japanese language track to compare performances. Seiji while still shy and effeminate is not the imitation of South Park's big gay Al that is found in the English dub.Overall this is a great show and I still recommend it. Just watch the Japanese track.",Kids on the Slope - Complete Collection

1364256,"Shortly into ""Vampires Suck,"" someone puts a Kick Me sign on the heroine's back.  The ""Twilight"" series is (at least in my opinion) so easy to parody it practically has a Kick Me sign of its own.  But this movie fails to take advantage of all the opportunities, though it hits about half.  Sometimes it makes you chuckle; other times - and there are a lot - you just roll your eyes.Back in the nineties, Alanis Morrisette had a hit called ""Isn't It Ironic.""  What was ironic was that she didn't seem to have a firm grasp of the term.  (Irony is not the same as bad luck.)  Neither do the scriptwriters of this movie.  Merely pointing out that you're being ironic is not enough to be a joke.  In other words, if you're a sourpuss whom hotties inexplicably find attractive, stating this isn't funny in itself.  It reminded me of ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" where characters kept saying things like, ""I'm the Token Black Guy.""  Similarly, this movie has characters pointing out that staring at someone in slo-mo is a sign of true love.  If that's enough to make you laugh, you'll like this movie.But wait.  There's more.  Throw in a generous helping of gross-out gags and add a smorgasbord of pop culture references, most of them random (the Kardashians, Gossip Girl, Twitter, etc), and add some dance numbers to the mix, season with some homophobic jokes, and there you go.  The good news is that it's pretty short, and the leads all do a great job, especially Jenn Proske, who has Kristen Stewart's lip biting and pensive pouting down cold, so it's not a complete disaster.  But close.I have to say this is a better movie than ""Epic Movie,"" and ""Date Movie,"" made by the same team.  If you're familiar with those two movies, you know this isn't much of a compliment.  But these parody movies are getting a bit better. Just not that fast.",N/A
279768,"Two incompetent vampire hunters, Professor Abronsius (Jack MacGowran of ""Doctor Zhivago"") and his bumbling assistant Alfred (Roman Polanski of ""Rush Hour 3"") venture to a remote village in Eastern Europe so they can substantiate the existence of vampires. ""The Fearless Vampire Killers or Pardon Me But Your Teeth are in my Neck"" is a spoof of vampire chillers in general and specifically Hammer horror movies. Mind you, this qualifies as a traditional vampire movie. The vampires have fangs, cast no reflection in mirrors, and spend their days in their coffins. Although the film generated a lot of coin in Europe, it flopped in America and MGM didn't help matters when they re-edited it so drastically that director Roman Polanski disowned it. Polanski penned the screenplay with his Repulsion collaborator G&eacute;rard Brach. Wilfrid Shingleton's production designs are first-rate. Nevertheless, Polanski and his collaborators scare up a lot of atmosphere in this 107 minute film. ""Blue Max"" lenser Douglas Slocombe's widescreen cinematography contributes to the air of suspense that Polanski generates. ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" is one of those rare films that you could watch in the dead of an incandescent summer and contract chills from its winter-covered surroundings.The narrator sets the ominous but amusing tone of this sophisticated parody: ""That night, penetrating deep into the heart of Transylvania, Professor Abronsius was unaware that he was on the point of reaching the goal of his mysterious investigations. In the course of which he had journeyed throughout Central Europe for years accompanied by his one and only faithful disciple, Alfred. A scholar and scientist whose genius was unappreciated, Abronsius had given up all to devote himself body and soul to what was to him a sacred mission. He had even lost his chair at K&ouml;nigsberg University, where for a long time his colleagues used to refer to him as ""The Nut."" Along the way, angry dogs attack our hapless heroes, and the elderly, white-haired professor arrives at an inn frozen to the bone. Jewish innkeeper Shagal (Alfie Bass of ""Alfie"") thaws out the professor after everybody chimes in with a remedy to thaw him out. The first thing that Abronsius notices is string of garlic dangling from the ceiling. As far as he is concerned, Abronsius has found vampires and he plans to stay. When Shagal shows Abronsius and Alfred to their room, he forgets that his bodacious, red-haired daughter Sarah (Sharon Tate) is luxuriating in their bathtub. He promises Abronsius and Alfred that they will have use of the bathroom tomorrow. Shagal whips his daughter for constantly using the tub to bathe in, and she informs Alfred later that she got into the habit of washing regularly in school.Naturally, when Abronsius inquires, Shagal and his townsfolk dismiss vampires as nothing more than superstitious shenanigans. Later, the professor spots a hunchback, Koukol (Terry Downes of ""A Study in Terror""), and sends Alfred off to follow the deformed fellow. Alfred doesn't get far, especially after the hunchback appears to dine on dog. At the inn, Shagal likes to slip out of bed late at night and sneak up to bundle up with Magda, the Maid (Fiona Lewis of ""Otley""), but Shagal's wife Rebecca (Jessie Robins of ""Billy Liar"") has her suspicions. She tries to catch him in the act, but clobbers the inquisitive Abronsius by mistake. He never learns who struck. Ironically, Shagal manages to conceal himself and his vast bulk behind the door in Magda's room. Sarah pays the price of bathing one time too often, and she is cavorting in bubbles when the skylight opens and Count von Krolock (Ferdy Mayne of ""Where Eagles Dare"") descends, in his regal Bela Lugosi cloak, and takes a bite out of her beautiful throat. Shagal goes off to avenge Sarah and comes back dead and drained. Meanwhile, Alfred has become infatuated with Sarah, and Abronsius and he set off for the Count's castle to rescue her. When they blunder into the castle, the vampire patriarch awaits them and has rooms prepared for them.You can tell that this vampire spoof is different when a nubile young lady tries to ward off a thirsty vampire with a crucifix and the vampire dismisses her efforts with a chuckle because he is Jewish: ""Oy, hev you got the wrong vampire!"" The ironic ending is a big plus, too.",N/A
858619,"The plot of this film is nothing special. You've got the world overrun by zombies, and then there's the good guys and the bad guys; the good in one area and the bad in another. So the good group has the evil ones to worry about, and there's the zombies that only come out at night.This is basically a slow-paced film that is overlong, lacking overall with lots of zombies, has poor scenery, no nudity, is talky in parts, and it needs more effective atmosphere. Most of the film takes place in these 2 locations with the good guys being sometimes attacked and harassed by the evil group, and there's the zombies that the walk the earth at night. The directing is decent, and it has some nice and gory practical effects; there's some good FX work here. However, I wanted a more action-packed film. The film uses practical gore effects instead of CGI, and I liked some of the gore scenes. There's a little bit of suspense in some parts when they must remain indoors at night because the zombies emerge, but they could've done a lot more with these sequences and made them more claustrophobic and suspenseful; it fails to gain any of the suspense and claustrophobia that is present in some of Romero's films. Some parts in the film are really good and gory, but it gets boring at times; it's unnecessary for the film to be that long with some parts that are just filler.The DVD quality is good, and it's in full screen.",N/A
750630,"Considering the very short pre-production period, and the enormous pressure that the filmmakers must have been feeling after the surprise hit of `Saw', it must be said that `Saw II' did a very good job. The script of the sequel, which was originally written as a thriller unrelated to `Saw,' surely borrows many elements from other films including `Saw' (yes of course), but still is effective as suspense with much gore, largely due to its better editing and sound effects.[ONE THING] you must do before watching `Saw II' is to see the original, in which one serial killer Jigsaw spears. It is very important for some characters re-appear in the sequel, and they play a considerably significant role in `Saw II.' And it would be a good test for you - if you find the original too violent and gory, you don't have to see the sequel, which is equally violent and gory.The sequel again shows the characters trapped in an old dirty room - this time eight persons - for the reasons only Jigsaw knows. These elaborate tricks are set up by the same Jigsaw, who again keeps on watching these confined characters through some media, but this sequel has a nice additional touch. For the two police detectives (Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer) are allowed to share the same experience as audience in the way I should not reveal.But the escape from the deadly house wholly depends on the actions of the trapped people, All the lethal traps or props are prepared in the most sinister (or nasty) way you can think of. Still, if you have seen the films of this genre, it is not difficult to anticipate what is coming next. At least you can sense something is there, even though admittedly some of the scenes involving these tricks always looks painful, or are really scare-inducing at times.However, as some viewers have said perhaps too rightly about the improbability of `Saw II' and its story, these characters often behave in the most stupid way, and the script is full of plot holes. Why don't they realize the importance of the hints Jigsaw gave right before them?  Why do they do unnecessary things like you know what? But booby traps are called booby traps because they don't catch wise people, so let's forget the incomprehensible behaviors of some characters, and not-so-good acting of some players.The ending (no spoilers) of `Saw II' is certainly surprising, but you may call it silly. But I found the original's ending surprising and silly, and in this sense the sequel did a fine job, a rare thing you can find these days when you see dreadfully silly sequels like `Cube 2.' `Saw II,' which benefits from bigger budget and more calculated editing, is a success as far as its visceral sensation goes. For all the dull explanations about Jigsaw's motives or many other atrociously philosophical nonsense, `Saw II' doesn't hide the fact that the film is all about the 'game,' about having fun, about feeling sensation and shock, and as such it is quite good.",Saw II

It does show how addict parents can squeak by at work and home until they hit the meat grinder of recovery.

1079035,"Anthony Hopkins loves movies where he can wipe the floor with his costars. He is almost giddy in roles like Hannibal Lector. His character in director Gregory Hoblit's latest thriller, Fracture, is no different. Like the eggshell analogy that Hopkins makes to his costar Ryan Gosling, Fracture falls prey to the same smarmy advice the star gives out: everything, no matter how perfect it may look, has a flaw.When wealthy and intelligent aerodynamics expert Ted Crawford (Hopkins) catches his wife in an act of infidelity with a Los Angeles homicide detective, he cooks up an elaborate plan to not only kill his wife, but to legally get away with it. What should have been an open and shut case for District Attorney Willy Beachum turns into a career ending nightmare as Crawford seemingly outsmarts the law at every turn.Though the direction, acting and visual style in Fracture is fantastic, the hairline crack that splinters the picture is the film's attempt at creating suspense by relying on a twist ending that is easily predictable given the information that is presented early in the film. How exactly does Crawford shoot his wife in the face with a weapon that has never been fired? Given the revealing marketing for the film, which gives away the circumstances surrounding the murder, audiences can easily trace the steps that Hopkins takes early in the film, clearly giving them an idea of where Fracture is going.In the best thrillers, when the inevitable twist hits, it is the little clues scattered throughout the picture which give the ending credibility. While all these details are within Fracture, they are so clear that if you don't see the crack in the villain's flawless plan immediately, you will be kicking yourself when the film finally presents it to you.That being said, how does Fracture manage to hold the audience's attention despite its blatant reveal of the picture's number one mystery? While a less experienced director might rely heavily on this twist alone, Gregory Hoblit manages to see through what could have been a thinly veiled, plot driven movie and finds an intriguing character study.While Hopkins chews up the scenery with his vast intellect and charming whit, Fracture is really the story of Willy Beachum. Considering the fact that Fracture consists of a cast which includes an Academy Award winner and two nominees, it was to be expected that Hoblit should have no problem drawing performances from his actors. The real surprise in Fracture is just how well planned out the story of Willy Beachum was.Ryan Gosling's character begins the film as an arrogant, hot shot district attorney who has been put on the fast track, landing a job in the private sector. Thinking that Crawford's case will be the last in his short tenure serving the public, Beachum shrugs off what appears to be an easy win. His refusal to take the case seriously, combined with Crawford's meticulous planning, ultimately leads to Beachum's downfall. With his cushy job in jeopardy, Beachum's character develops a methodical obsession with Crawford, searching desperately to find the one clue that will put his nemesis away for good.As the film progresses Gosling's character changes from cocky to heroic. At first it is fun to see Hopkins toy with him, but thanks to Gosling's surprisingly good acting and Hoblit's taught direction, as Beachum changes, so does the audience's expectations. We want Gosling to come out on top. This change, from selfishness to selflessness is what gives his character the roundness that carries Fracture past its faults.Though predictable, it is the dramatic arc of Willy Beachum which separates Fracture from just another episode of Law and Order. While Hopkins' character begins the film as a smarmy antihero, he essentially pushes Beachum into becoming the unlikely champion of the story, and in some ways Fracture showcases one legendary actor passing on the torch to another.-Joe Russo",N/A

The story-line is simple, a meteor crashes in a small farming town in the US and releases an alien that proceeds to take over humans.  Combining ideas from the Blob, the Alien franchise, and the Living Dead zombie movies, the final product is part comedy, part action, and part gore.  Though classified as horror, this movie is closer to a B-grade science fiction flick as the level of scariness is below that of the Halloween, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street franchises.  The special effects are believable due to them being low key.

369512,"This polarizing Oliver Stone movie really got the MPAA ratings board in an uproar when it was scheduled for release.  They assigned it an NC-17 tag due to the excessive violence, gore, sex, profanity and the like.  It was eventually cut enough to get an R but remained highly controversial.  Critics pretty much lined up on the side of brilliant satire or loathsome glorification of violence.  Here we get the unrated version and even a perverse cut scene involving Ashley Judd (special features).Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are a couple of misfits in love with each other and the power of killing people in cold blood.  They were both abused as children as we learn in flashbacks and a sit-com (complete with laugh track) fantasy.  I guess Stone and his writers (David Veloz for the script and Quentin Tarantino for the story) put this in to make the natural born killers somewhat sympathetic.  What makes this film different from a similarly violent ""True Romance"" which came out a year earlier, is that many if not most of the victims are random and completely innocent in ""NBK.""Satire involves humor, often subtle but there are some over-the-top moments that strike that cord.  For example the fantasy sit-com which involves the laugh track responding enthusiastically when Mallory's father (real comedian Rodney Dangerfield) abuses his daughter.  The juxtaposition of the laughing is humorous, but the vile father isn't.  M & M get more notoriety as they advance their murder spree to the point of it becoming fodder for a national TV show headed by reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.).  Like terrorists, M & M want credit for their carnage and Gale is willing to give it to them.Once captured, M & M aren't finished as they create chaos in prison thanks to a clueless warden (Tommy Lee Jones) and Gales TV production.  ""NBK"" certainly satirizes television's fascination with violence (if it bleeds it leads) but truly piles on.  It also pokes fun at criminals and crime fighters alike, but I wonder how many bad guys watch this movie and ""get it.""  Stone throws every trick in the book in the production of this film.  Some of the movie is in color, some scenes are in black and white.  While most of the film is 35 mm, some is video tape and super 8.  He uses fantasy, newsreels and animation.  He even manages to toss in a few references to his JFK conspiracy theory.  So where do I stand?  Right down the middle.  If you can handle the violence and have an appreciation for dark comedy and satire, put this on your list.  If you're the least bit squeamish, skip it.The Blu ray transfer is excellent but does have variations due to the different formats Stone uses in the movie mix.  The Dolby TruHD is likewise excellent.  Near the film's conclusion a huge prison riot occurs and the chaos explodes from all the speakers which adds to the effect.  Great soundtrack by the way.",N/A
635073,"The War of the Worlds is a great novel and Spielberg is a director of exceptional talent and accomplishment, so I had been hoping for a lot from this film. In the event, I have got part of what I was hoping for. Very occasionally, a novel can be 'walked' straight on to the screen (The Big Sleep, with a script by Faulkner, is a striking case), and I found myself wondering whether this novel might not have benefited from the same treatment. Some of Spielberg's changes are perfectly reasonable, others less so in my own opinion. It makes perfectly good sense to bring the action forward by a century into the present day, for instance. I suppose there's no harm either in changing the main actors from Wells's scientist with a wife and a brother to a dysfunctional American family, as this may provide enhanced 'human interest' or some such benefit for all I would know. Again, I have no real problem with the way the film combines the roles of the curate and the artilleryman in the book into the single persona of the former ambulance-driver, and I can well understand that Spielberg would have thought it prudent to tone down the socialistic elements in this aspect of the story in order to avoid setting off the wrong types of reaction in American audiences. What I do have a major problem with is the appearance of the Martians themselves. I'm sorry to report that these have far too much in common with a certain wretched TV series. The author's own description is one that stays in the memory, to say the very least, and Wells's Martians look the way they do for very clear reasons that he provides. What was gained by going downmarket in the way Spielberg chooses to do? Nothing that I can think of except perhaps better audience figures from harking back to that ghastly broadcast series.In fact the best things in the film come directly from Wells. Even one of the best lines, where the statement that the invaders come from somewhere else is met with the question 'Where - Europe?' is a very clever adaptation of a good joke in the book comparing the attitudes of Mrs Elphinstone to the Martians on the one hand and the French on the other. The Martian tripods are simply terrific, their appearance lifted more or less exactly from the book. However The War of the Worlds is a work of political and social philosophy and speculation, not just some science-fiction yarn. I really would have liked Spielberg to be a bit more ambitious and reflect this more than he seems to have felt like doing. For one thing, the Martians are invading the earth because their own smaller planet is cooling and dying around them. Wells explicitly says that there is no reason to suppose them 'pitiless'. They have come for pressing practical reasons connected with their own very survival. We know now, as Wells did not, that all they were going to find on Venus is a searing hell under the rolling white clouds, so it would be more than likely, as Wells says again, that they would learn from the failure of their first expedition and come back to the earth better prepared the next time rather than stake everything on one throw, which is what the film seems to be suggesting. The last gesture of the Martians in the film is an expression indicative of hatred, which doesn't even make sense considering they saw us as their food source. What consumer of beef makes hostile faces at beef-herds? The Martians' purpose can't have been 'extermination' as someone is made to say in the film, only subjugation, another matter perfectly clear from the novel.More survives of the view Wells takes of the behaviour of humanity itself, and Spielberg handles the mob-scenes rather well. However what he tones down more than I would have wished is the reflections, in the novel expressed via the persona of the artilleryman, on the likely behaviour of human beings towards one another once the Martian dominion was hypothetically established. The artilleryman's predictions are class-based like the vision of the Eloi and Morlocks in the Time-Machine, but they are far from endorsing Marxism and there is no reason to see them as any firm viewpoint held by the author himself.Perhaps the very best things in the entire film are to be found in the voiceovers right at the start and right at the end. The words are lifted almost verbatim from the novel itself at these points, and they are simply awesome, the first page in particular of The War of the Worlds being surely one of the greatest in all English fiction with the last page not far behind it in that respect. The exquisite irony of the fact that the Martians, who might have viewed us as we view micro-organisms in a laboratory were in their turn thwarted and destroyed by just such organisms when nothing humanity could do availed in the least is obviously not lost on the director. I just wish he had raised his game more consistently to something like the level of the theme he was taking on.",N/A

1662285,"CONTAINS SPOILERS SO PLEASE WATCH OUTWe wrote our first Dexter review at the end of S7 and threw up some possible story points for S8 (pretty unsuccessfully!).  There seems to be alot of early negative reviews here, relating to the season in general, but particularly with the ending and although we were disappointed too the 1 & 2 star ratings are way to harsh.After writing the S7 review we had hoped that the final season would eschew the standard Dexter formula and NOT introduce new characters and provide yet another serial/master killer.  The reason being that all S8 had to do was start at precisely where S7 ended and should have simply focused on Angel, sharply changing his mind about retiring, and with the full resources of Miami Metro behind him, aggressively investigate the murder of Maria (I mean, is there a fan out there who really did not want to see more of the immediate aftermath of Maria's murder..........particularly when Dexter & Deb went back to the party....and then the hours, days and weeks after!?).  Ultimately, the entire season would have revolved around the unit slowly piecing together evidence that points to Dexter being the killer (hell, you even had Angel find the warrants Maria had obtained for Dexters/Debs phone records!!).  The story turns/developments that could have been done would have been more than enough to fully flesh out the season without the unecessary tangents that this final season took.  In addition, it could have included and given more screen time to the main supporting characters (eg. Vince would have been pivotal in forensically identifying his 'hero' as the 'villain' & Quinn would have been divided by his affection for Deb).  There was alot to work with here!With the murder of Maria the final season was always going to be downbeat but even though we thought it would happen the death of Deb was still heartbreaking (particularly when the impression was that she might be allowed to survive.......but it appears the makers did want her, and Dexter, to pay the ultimate price for their actions).With a show that lasted 8 seasons, with fans investing so much time and caring for such appealing characters, the show should not have ended with so much ambiguity and so many loose ends and unanswered questions (to the point that the last few scenes seemed like an 11th hour tack on).  Not that we want to be spoon-fed but a certain amount of definitive closure should have been allowed for.Despite its failings S8 is still very good but contrary to the filmakers apparent endgame this is a show that demanded, and we hope most fans would agree and have accepted (and really wanted), a 'happy' ending.......with Dexter, Deb & Harrison making an escape when it was clear Miami Metro was on to them (how great would it have been to see the reactions of Angel, et al, once the evidence slowly revealed the truth about their great friend Dexter!?).Thanks once more to everyone involved with this marvellous programme that we will almost certainly never see its like again......but we will also kind of hate you because, at the moment, the first thing we think of when we now think of Dexter is that Deb dies.....hopefully that will fade in time.PS: a few more days have passed since we saw the final episode and the ending has gotten less and less acceptable.....to the point that our rating has reduced to 3.5 stars.  Apparently, we need better lives if we're still thinking about a TV show, huh!?",Dexter: The Complete Final Season
975198,"***1/2Lawrence Sterne's 18th Century novel, ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"" has long been viewed as a largely ""unfilmable"" work due to its enormous length and famously idiosyncratic style. The bawdy, satirical tome, done in the form of a mock-autobiography, originally appeared in nine volumes and broke new artistic ground by employing the kind of stream-of-consciousness narration and self-referential self-awareness that would later come to define the post-modernist style of 20th and 21st Century literature. As one of the characters in the movie exclaims, the ahead-of-its-time ""Shandy"" was already post-modern before modern existed.The movie, ""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story,"" is NOT a version of the novel either but rather a droll, frequently hilarious faux-documentary about one movie crew's valiant but futile attempt to bring this unwieldy literary work to the silver screen. Writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce and director Michael Winterbottom have used Sterne's novel as a mere reference point for their own slashing satire on film-making in general and the adaptation of great novels in particular. Indeed, the movie is as much a tribute to Fellini's ""8 1/2"" - another film about a filmmaker's struggle to complete a challenging movie - as it is to ""Tristram Shandy."" The movie makers even employ Nina Rota's score from that film as background for the action rather than music that would more accurately reflect the period of the story. Talk about post-modern!Steve Coogan plays himself as the actor hired on to inhabit the roles of both Tristram and his father, Walter, in the film that is being made. Joining him is Rob Brydon, who also plays himself as well as Tristram's uncle, Toby. In the modern scenes, the two are acutely funny as they squabble over how each is to play his respective part and who is to be allotted the most time on screen. However, the best parts of the movie are the scenes re-creating the novel on film, which are done with an anarchic spirit and a freewheeling cleverness that put one in mind of Tony Richardson's ""Tom Jones."" With their raillery and wit, these sequences almost convince us that, given the sufficient resources and the proper talents, maybe a decent movie COULD be made of Sterne's novel (or at least a small part of it) after all.Some of the film-making sequences are enjoyable as well, zeroing in on the compromises brought about by having to balance budgetary restraints with personal egos. Yet, the movie tends to run out of steam the further away it gets from Sterne's original story. Coogan is amusing as a character when he is focused on the mechanics of his acting, but he's far less interesting when brooding about his troubled relationship with his girlfriend, his role as a new daddy or his contemplation of an affair with his attractive assistant. These scenes, which take up a significant portion of the final act of the movie, wind up draining away much of the cleverness and energy that are found in such abundance during the earlier stretches of the film. Yet, if ""A Cock and Bull Story"" finally dribbles away into insignificance at the end, it still provides us with an hour and a half or so of really hearty laughter as compensation. And considering how few genuine laughs one generally encounters in movies these days, that's a strong bit of compensation indeed.",Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story

1060986,"Mission:Magic was one of the first origanal animated series from Filmation. It was also one of the first cartoons to have a diversified cast of characters. The show was a mixture of Magic School Bus and Isis. Some of the background music for the show was also used in other Filamation classics such as the Shazam/Isis Hour. The only downfall to the show was the terrible laugh track that was included with each episode.The characters in the show were:Rick Springfield - This legendary singer used a gramophone to get in contact with the Adventurer's Club to give them missions in magical lands to solve mysteries. Rick has a pet owl called Ptolemy. Rick has a song he sings in almost every episode of the series.Miss Tickle - The teacher in charge of the Adventurer's Club who had magical powers and a magical cat called Tut-Tut who is a stone statue of ancient lore that becomes a real cat. Miss Tickle uses school supplies like chalk, keys and erasers as magical items, and has a magical purse that when a knob is turned, makes the Adventurer's Club members fly.Carol - A blonde girl who is infatuated with Rick Springfield.Harve - A chubby kid with glasses who always lands on his rump unlike everyone else who lands on their feet when they are flying to a mission. Harve is afraid of heights and thinks he can do anything.Socks - Wears a hat that looks like Dr. Seuss' Cat in the Hat.Vinnie - Messes up his speech all the timeFranklin - Black student who always talks about how he doesn't like how tall he is.Kim - Asian girl who seems to be the most level headed of the group.Principal Samuels - Only in a couple of episodes but loves to tell tall tales.Some fun facts about Mission: Magic - Miss Tickle and Tut-Tut debuted on another cartoon series The Brady Kids (an animated version of the Brady Bunch). Tut-Tut and Ptolemy were based off the poem The Owl and the Pussycat. The episode Horse Feathers is the only time another character sings a song other than Rick Springfield.

768016,"I was disappointed with how the series ended. I am a Dawson fan. For 6 years, Joey and Dawson continued coming back to each other and Joey even sleeps with Dawson near the end of the show.  She toyed with Dawson's  feelings for 6 years like she could not make up her mind about their relationship and how she could not let him go.  She kept Dawson on a roller coaster ride.  Dawson would have been completed devoted to Joey had she let him.  In the end, she chooses Pacey.  Now if that wasn't enough, when she visits Jen in the hospital during Jen's dying days, Joey tells Jen she has always known who she should be with (meaning Pacey).  That line really ticked me off.  If Joey had always known that she should have been with Pacey, while was she always dangling Dawson from her chain, sleeping with him and everything else?  I thought the series ended with Joey looking like the bad guy.  The show should have ended with Joey having a completely new love interest.  Dawson should have told them both to ""you know what"" and go to California and never look back.  Pacey should go back out to sea and date a new girl at every port.  He never seemed like a character that would settle down but then again, maybe that is what Joey deserved.

I did enjoy the Walace and Gromit films and Chicken Run, but this film seemed to lack whatever they had in common with their computer animated cousins.  It felt one dimensional and seemed to leer in your face like some of the poorer children's programing does, instead of the perhaps not too subtle wink at the camera the better cartoons have always had - from Bugs Bunny up through the Tick (animated) and beyond.It wasn't terrible ... it had some moments ... but just didn't do it for me in the end.",N/A

The story is episodic, which might work in a novel -- but doesn't work in a film, which should have an (overall) rising sense of dread, foreboding, etc, throughout.There are one or two genuinely frightening scenes.

The CD of vocal exercises really is valuable and could have easily stood on its own.  The techniques aren't new, but do remind singers how to access more power without damaging their vocal chords or fighting chronic laryngitis (my personal problem).I taught drama for decades and recommended Born To Sing by Howard Austin and Elizabeth Howard to my students.  In those days it was simply an audio cassette of vocal exercises, but is now a complete and extremely comprehensive package.

1264825,"""A Serious Man""  is an original.  Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (""No Country for Old Men""), the film focuses on an Everyman named Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor at a Midwestern university where he will soon learn if he will receive tenure.  The year is 1967, and Larry is in for some unexpected troubles.  His wife (Sari Lennick) is leaving him for best friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed).  His unemployed brother (Richard Kind) is becoming more and more of a burden.  His son, Danny (Aaron Wolff), is secretly listening to rock music at Hebrew school rather than learning the Torah.  The alluring woman next door sunbathes nude.  Larry elicits sympathy because he is a decent guy bombarded by a series of incidents that lead him to wonder why God has singled him out for ""tsouris.""  Distraught, he consults three different rabbis, who lead him on a convoluted journey as he struggles to make sense of it all.There are many Coen trademarks here:  emphasis on the grotesque, dry humor, ominous low-angle cinematography, situations bordering on the surreal, and bizarre dream/nightmare sequences.  The Coens tell their story episodically, offering perhaps a few too many tangential subplots.  When we think we've latched onto the main thread, focus shifts, and then shifts again.  The film is like a homemade chicken soup where the individual ingredients haven't quite blended.Performances are uniformly low-key as characters create comedy in subtle ways.  There are no jokes, but we laugh at the earnest characters, the absurd situations, and the skewering of established religion.  ""A Serious Man"" is the anti-sitcom.  It showcases a family with its warts and flaws right out front.  Ozzie and Harriet never worried about the meaning of life or why a dark cloud settled over the family.  The Coens revel in dissecting Larry's angst as we watch his awkward, humorous missteps through life, relationships, and morality.  The ending is rather abrupt, and might require a replay to understand how everything comes together.Blu-ray and DVD extras include the featurettes ""Becoming Serious,"" which explores the creative vision behind ""A Serious Man;"" ""Creating 1967,"" a tour of the Minneapolis neighborhoods used in the movie; and ""Hebrew and Yiddish for Goys,"" a guide through the mysteries of the Hebrew and Yiddish languages.",A Serious Man

1232411,"Of all the Key anime series that have been localized for the American audience, Key is the weakest of the lot. It contains all the usual Key elements - gorgeous back grounds, a tragic story line, a mystical or magical element to the backstory, and lots and lots of cute anime girls. However, for some reason, the elements that made Kanon and Clannad so good don't fit together so well in this story. It's almost as if they put all the various Key elements into a box, shook it up, and poured them out on a table and called the result a new series. I can almost see the lab geek with a clipboard checking things off. ""Pretty Girl cast, check. Mysterious magical powers or tragic backstory for each girl, check. Forgotten past life connection between the hero and the obvious heroine, check. Ambiguous pretty boy hero, check. Single mom/aunt/caretaker for hero/heroine, check. Pretty art, check. Nice music, check. Okay, call it a wrap. Put it in a box and ship it!""Oops, forgot to write a story that makes sense.There are two things that should serve as a warning: right on the back of the box, it reads ""The questions are rampant, but the answers float aimlessly in the air."" Which, in plainspeak, means even the people who made the thing can't figure out what is going on. Then, if you read the box for ""Air, The Motion Picture"" (which, admittedly, I have not yet watched) it describes itself as ""a cinematic reinvention of the acclaimed television series"". A good story would not have needed ""reinvention"".Before you read any further, I will warn you that I do include spoilers in this next bit. The story, such as it is, is this: Yukito is a traveling performer who can make dolls move with his magical powers. He also is looking for a mysterious ""girl in the sky"" that his mother had been looking for her entire life and never found. As the story goes on, we learn that the girl in the sky suffers from sad dreams, but if she should ever stop dreaming, she will die. Then we meet Misuzo, a clumsy ditz who befriends Yukito. She has an odd phobia in that she gets hysterical if she makes a friend because she's lost everybody in her life she cared about up to that point. She is an orphan, being cared for by her aunt who doesn't seem to give a hang about the girl and isn't at all disturbed when she brings home Yukito. Yukito then encounters a wide assortment of other schoolgirl/love interests, any one of whom may or may not be the girl in the sky because most have magical powers of some kind or other. As Yukito and Misuzo get closer to each other, Misuzo reveals that she has dreams about flying, which are very sad dreams, and Yukito begins to wonder if she is the girl he has been looking for.At this point the story begins to lose its way. We discover that Yukito's mom actually knew the girl in the sky, and promised to take her to the beach, thinking this might make her happy and stop the sad dreams, but the girl in the sky dies before she can fulfill her promise. So the duty passes on to Yukito to find the girl and fulfill her last wish, which is kind of hard to do since she supposedly died. Then, suddenly, we find ourselves in fuedal Japan, where the whole story line of the magical winged girls is explored. Then Yukito, evidently remembering that he was a samarai who protected the winged girl in fuedal Japan, vows to use all his powers to make Misuzo happy before she has the final dream and dies. And things go totally whack-a-ding-hoy. He turns into the idiot bird who has been hopping around in and out of all the episodes. We then see a retelling of Misuzo's life, with minor changes so that things will have a happier ending. So far so good. Then Misuzo's aunt, who now suddenly has really loved her all along, vows to take Misuzo to the beach. This fulfills Misuzo's final wish, so she up and dies, making Yukito's unexplained transformation and sacrifice meaningless. And here the TV series ended. The story left me thinking that the writers had all the elements of a good story but did not know how to put the pieces together. All the side stories, centering around the other girls, seem unrelated and tacked on, the girls seeming to be there only to provide Yukito other love interests.We then get the ""Air in Summer"" specials, which takes the feudal Japan back story and expands upon it. The only thing the specials explains is that Yukito is the descendant of the two bodyguards for the Girl in the Sky, a samarai and a lady magician, who after the death of the Girl in the Sky, decided that she will probably be reincarnated somewhere down the road so they should start having babies with each other so that their descendants can watch out after the next incarnation of the Girl in the Sky. One again, the whole Yukito=bird and Why the heck did Misuzo Have To Die questions are unresolved.All these complaints aside, if you like Key series, you will probably like Air. But it is the poorest, so far, of the Key offerings. It seems almost like they were writing this anime following a formula, without any inspiration to guide them. The music is nice, the art is pretty, (though the backgrounds are gorgeous, the characters themselves look like they were lifted out of a video game and don't have the same level of finish as the backgrounds). If you can make sense of the story, you are a smarter person than I am. But even at it's worst, Air is a much better watch than, say, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z or (shudder) Naruto.",Air: The Complete Series

The bad things about this is the music also isn't as great, the plot confuses me at points, the hitcher on this one isn't nearly as good as Rutger hauer from the first movie, the way the hitcher dies on this one is a bit stupid and the main character from the first gets killed on this one and the woman has to kill the hitcher by hirself. The camera work looks a bit bad in this film also. But still, the action still has its place in this sequel. Too be honest, this film is not nearly as dark or as atmospheric as the original. There are no huge stunts, massive action sequences or anything. I do recommend the shootout scene in the restaurant though. But, really, you have to see the first film, since that is an all time classic. Get that instead.",The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting
1195043,"Knowing starts out strong, with a '50s era flashback to a creepy kid obsessed with numbers, that also serves to remind us that this film is aiming for something of a '50s science fiction vibe.  As part of the opening ceremony for a new elementary school, kids put pictures of the future into a time capsule, with plans to open it up 50 years later.  The creepy dark-haired girl puts her list of seemingly random numbers into the mix, along with the crayon drawings produced by the rest of the kids.Fifty years later, of course, Nick Cage plays a single father and MIT astrophysicist whose belief in providence was shaken by the death of his wife.  When the time capsule is opened, and his son gets the numbers, and as he comes to see what the numbers mean, it becomes apparent that even senseless tragedy may not be simply random.  Alex Proyas channelsClose Encounters of the Third Kindfor a number of plot elements and for a religious sense of mystery that drives the film, but aims less for a sense of wonder as dread, until things start to get silly.  Still, it's a fun ride and well worth watching, and comes to a satisfying finish.In what follows I won't give away the end, but may say too much for some, so if you don't want spoilers, stop reading .... The creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and dread that director Alex Proyas sets up to begin with gradually gives way to hokey and predictable developments as, in classic Hollywood style, Cage's scientist and his personal and family dramas become perfect microcosms of events of cosmic significance.  Where saving the world and falling in love and reconciling with family and healing old wounds all come to amount to the same thing.  My wife and I could not help but laugh out loud as Nick Cage promised his son with utter sincerity that he wouldn't let anything happen to him - even as it had just been proven to him beyond reasonable doubt that he had no power to prevent the calamities the mysterious numbers were predicting.  Or when Rose Byrne's character, faced with the destruction of the world (including herself and her daughter) explains how devastated she would be without her daughter if the upcoming disaster causes them to be separated, and Nick's character nods, knowing exactly how she feels.  Of course, and the thing that would really get me most about my entire city (including myself and my entire family and everyone around me) being destroyed in a nuclear explosion is that I'd miss my dog and be sad about being separated from my wife and kids.And what about the numbers?  Apparently supernatural beings wanted to warn us about impending disasters by revealing the numbers to a young girl.  Of course, that didn't help much when the numbers ended up in a time capsule for the duration of most of the disasters.  I guess the girl who knew them lived long enough to let others know about them, but they thought she was crazy.  Still, even those who knew about  and wanted to avert the predicted disasters were unable to change their fate - so what was the point of a bunch of pale supernatural beings sitting around watching to be sure the kids made the right predictions if they couldn't do anything about it?  Perhaps, I guess, to convince them that the final prophecy was real and so they should go along?  Why not just explain things to the kids, since clearly they were able to?  It might make sense if somehow the plot established that their only means of communication was through numbers, but that's not the case, as revealed in the course of things.  There's a lot here that doesn't make a lot of sense, except as a way of tying some kind of voodoo fascination with numerology to an apocalyptic scenario.Still, I have to say, in spite of the eventual goofiness as the film became overly melodramatic, it was a lot of fun to watch, and had a satisfying end.  In some ways the hokey elements add to the appeal - it's like watching '50s science fiction, where the wild implausibility combined with the seriousness of the characters gives just the right balance of melodrama and intensity to keep you on the edge of your seats and smiling.  Proyas manages to keep the characters interesting, and has a strong visual sense both for creating a vivid atmosphere in the ""ordinary"" moments and for creating extraordinarily convincing scenes of destruction.  I'm not sure what is his fascination with pale ""watcher"" type villians - since if you look at all his films that's what they are, fromDark CitytoI, Robot(note the similarity of the robots to the scary types in this film) - I can't rememberThe Crowwell enough to say if it fits there as well (I saw it in theaters when it first came out, and that was a long time ago).  But they do work, and create a palpable sense of cinematic dread (until you see them up close and they start to look a bit silly).",N/A

But that's totally beside the point.  The main thing is it's not that scary.  It's probably just as scary as the recent-ish remakes of 13 GHOSTS and THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL.  Not that scary, IMO, although I did enjoy the action and macabre of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL back when I was 16 (haven't re-watched it recently, I don't remember it well enough to know what I'd think of it if I saw it again).  They try to incorporate drama-esque elements in the storytelling, bits of character development and the actors do give it their all, which gives the film a more down to earth and believable feel, but the story was too thin and what little story there was didn't get the attention it deserves.  The focus of the film was the supernatural build-up that made it obvious to the household that the place was haunted.  The paranormal investigating itself takes less than half the film, and prior to then it just seems like 1979's THE AMITYVILLE HORROR in HD.IT's not a bad film, I just was very underwhelmed after the anticipation surrounding the film's release date.

1184031,"Before i get to the review, allow me some observations about the director's career.  M Night Shyamalan has somehow found himself among the most unfairly criticized of modern filmmakers in spite of the fact that every one of his films are among the most unique, atmospheric, and imaginative out there.  Like Tarantino, it has become fashionable among the too-cool-for-the-room set to bash everything the man does even as they wait in line on opening day for each of his films.  You won't see me tripping over myself to check out the latest Paul Anderson or Uwe Boll joint.  Why continue to follow the career of a hack?  Even the usually even-headed Trey Parker and Matt Stone are guilty of Shyamalan bashing.  The most popular criticism is that his films rely solely on twists.  The truth is that onlyThe Sixth Sensehad a profound twist and most will agree that the film was already compelling up to that point.  Yet both film and director have been branded regardless.  Each film he has made has been nearly unclassifiable and very different from what would be expected of any film genre.  This is called creativity, folks.  It's a shame that people can't be comfortable without having each and every preconception and cliche met.Lady in the Water-while essentially a film about childhood- was really a feature-length taunting of his critics.  Childish?  That was the point.  As a fan of the director's work I really enjoyed that.  Small wonder the reviews were bad; most viewers either didn't understand what they were watching or they were the ones being insulted.  Okay, rant over.  On to M Night Shyamalan's latest.""The Happening"" was a great concept.  Mark Wahlburg plays our protagonist, a hip science teacher who we meet lecturing his students about Einstein's theory that if bees vanished off of the face of the Earth, mankind would die out shortly after.  Right away we are reminded of humanity's susceptibility to nature and inability to fully comprehend it's workings.  Then it ""Happens"".  By now you all know that ""it"" is a wave of mass suicide; one that begins sweeping across New England with frightening speed.  The resulting carnage will leave horror fans drooling for more.  Wahlburg's character gathers up his wife and his best friend (played by a brilliant John Leguizamo) with daughter and flees New York along with the rest of the surviving populace.  Great filmmaking.The deaths in ""The Happening"" are the main draw.  In spite of the advertisements' focus on the fact that this is Shyamalan's first R-rated feature, the director uses impeccable restraint in portraying the violent suicides and keeps the profanity nearly nonexistent.  The killshots are suspensful and teasing, showing enough to shock and disturb you, but never lingering enough to become gruesome.  My favorite suicide involves a man at the zoo entering the lion's cage.  The scene is shown as footage from a handheld camera and the result is jarring and unclear, but certainly violent and gory.  The concept, as always, is a brilliant one; nature evolving to strike back at mankind is truly good stuff.  The first half of this film is outstanding.  Unfortunately, it overstays it's welcome.Now the bad.  Leguizamo is the only worthwhile performance and he is grossly underused.  Wahlburg and his onscreen wife Zooey Deschanel have zero chemistry (though she does have beautiful eyes) and there are more than a few moments where you wonder if the comedic acting is intentional or not.  And the menacing shots of trees are anything but menacing.  Sorry, there is just no way to make a tree shaking in the wind scary unto itself.  And the gimmick of having the victims walk a few steps backwards before offing themselves strikes me as more than a little bit silly.  The stopping dead in their tracks and saying bizarre things was all well and good, but why would they walk backwards?  So goofy.  In spite of the movie's plodding pace, many of the film's concepts are very poorly fleshed-out.  Watching Wahlburg's character put the pieces together is great until Shyamalan apparently decides to throw them out the window for the sake of being mysterious or some such thing.  More could have been done with the mood ring, which comes off as a gimmick to give the characters something to talk about while a whole lot of nothing happens.  Human energy and moods are talked about but never properly integrated into the story's events like they should have been.  Sloppy.  Very sloppy.I hate to become one of Shyamalan's critics, but this was a poorly put together story that would have made an amazing episode ofMasters of Horror, but just was not ready to be a feature length film.  The first half was jaw-dropping at times and extremely promising, but the characters quickly become tiresome and eventually you're left just waiting for the next death scene.  This script needed some serious work and Shyamlan's filmmaking talents could not fully vindicate his poor writing this time around.  But in spite of it's laundry list of shortcomings, ""The Happening"" has some very worthwhile concepts and deaths that make it worth a peek.  Consider this least of m Night Shyamalan's flicks a tentative rental.  Pass if you're not a fan of his work.  Who am I kidding?  Most of those guys ran out and saw it before I did.  2 1/2 stars rounded up for a strong first half.",N/A

1312664,"There is a subset of the comedy action genre that needs to be dubbed the pure popcorn adventure. This is the film that has no real substance, a great big budget and likable stars that we are pleased to simply sit through and then forget about as soon as the film ends. Disney's The Sorceror's Apprentice is one of these films, It is the Disney entry in the every major studio feels the need to make a Harry Potter like fim before its too late to do so trend. Does this make the film a bad one? Not really. The film is watchable for its entire length its just not something that you will remember within a few days of seeing it.Nicholas Cage plays Balthazar Blake a contemporary of Merlin who is charged with finding a sorceror who can prevent the Rising. The Rising is an event that will occur if Morgana Le Fay is allowed to be reincarnated or released from a grimhold nested doll that she was trapped in. The Rising will lead to the end of the world as we know it and surely enough special effects to use the estimated 150M that this film cost to make.Enter the picture Dave (Jay Beruchel) a nerdy twenty something that Balthazar is convinced is the prime Merliner. The Prime Merliner is is the only wizard powerful enough to head of the coming of the Rising that has been put into place by Balthazar's rival Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina). The film than procedes to show us the training of the future wizard.All of this confusing plot simply serves as a gateway for the film's special effects. There are huge set pieces involving car chases, flying statues, tesla coils and a remake of the famous mop scene from Fantasia. Add to this romance with the most beautiful girl in town Becky Barnes (Theresa Palmer) and we have what Disney would have predicted to be a huge hit. What Disney got in reality was an ok film that never really found its audience.This is not a bad way to spend the evening and if the popcorn is hot can be quite fun.

557049,"Okay, so I know movies aren't history, and I accept that, but could we at least try to get a bit closer? Mel Gibson's Martin comes across as a cross between Robin Hood and Francis Marion (the real life guerilla leader in South Carolina during the Revolution). Fortunately for political correctness, Martin is evidently a Southerner who believed in freeing his slaves, and was such a saintly master that they welcome him with open arms to their island when he seeks refuge. The villian of the piece is played with teeth-knashing relish and complete inaccuracy. The whole movie is sort of a glossed over Reader's Digest version of the American Revolution in the South. Oh, and my least favorite scene? Where the Americans, who were always low on powder and shot during the real war, waste tons of it blowing up a British ship in the harbor of Charleston.The sets and costuming are excellent, and the soft focus camera work gives a nice patina, but if you're looking for something to remotely reflect the real Revolution this movie will drive you mad!",N/A

But I really think they're lying; without giving anything away, the ending in this follow up strongly suggests ""The Last, Last, Last Exorcism, and I Really, Really Mean it This Time!""  Don't know how they're going to fit that title on the Marguee, though.This film is actually fairly original, if you wave your hands a bit on the films that it stole, err, ""borrowed"" from:  ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Exorcist 2:  The Heretic"" (and you'd have to be a heretic to like that dog), ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"" (this one's a little hazy to me since I saw it so long ago though), ""The Believers"" (once again, hazy), and, believe it or not, and yes last but not least -- and I really mean it this time -- ""Carrie.""  Well, maybe it's not exactly completely original I guess.This film is set in New Orleans, which I thought was a good idea.  After all, there's lots of witchcraft there, and there's lots of Voodoo there as well.  We all know that Voodoo is bad now, mmkay?  'Cause Voodoo means that you really dislike somebody and want to do bad things to him or her.  And that's just not right.  But Ashley Bell, who returns as Nell -- she was quite terrific in the first movie and is quite good here as well -- doesn't want to do bad things to other people; she really doesn't.  But she just can't quite help herself.  Why?  Well, I think that that question leads us to a possible theme. . . .""A tiger never changes her stripes.""  Oh, and perhaps, ""The past will come back to haunt you whether you like it or not.""  That latter idea seems to be the major theme, while the former could be a minor theme.  But they seem to stick with these themes for the entirety of the film, and I think that that was a smart move; a film with a strong theme is always a good idea.But unfortunately, I can't quite say that this is exactly a strong film.  I did like it a bit, and I did jump out of my seat quite a few times.  It's probably really a 3.5, but I decided to round down today -- not because I want to do bad things to this film, cause that just wouldn't be right -- but rather because I think that it ""borrowed"" from a few too many other films and therefore lost some originality.",N/A

416464,"PLEASE NOTE:  This review contains EXTREME spoilers.  If you have not seen this movie and do not want to know what it is about, don't read this!!!  You have been warned.In the slew of high school movies made in the 80s, three rise above the pack as classics:  ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"";  ""Better Off Dead"" with John Cusack;  and ""Heathers.""  I am roughly the same age as most of the stars of these flicks (Matthew Broderick, John Cusack and Christian Slater are all, like me, children of the 1960s; while the female lead of ""Heathers"" was slightly older, from 1971).  By the end of the 80s I was fed up to the back teeth with teen movies and missed all three of these superlatives on their first run.  In fact, I came to ""Ferris"" twenty-five years after it hit the theaters, ""Better Off Dead"" more than a quarter-century after it was made, and ""Heathers"" (last but not necessarily least) at only slightly less than that (it came out in 1989 and I saw it first in 2013).My unfamiliarity with these movies was a terrible strain to lots of my friends in the 1990s.  I was running with a younger crowd and they were always talking about ""Ferris"" and, even more, about ""Heathers.""  In fact, one friend had what amounted to an obsession with it.  And I, their best friend, never picked up on any of their references.All three movies hold up well, but all are problematic.  ""Better Off"" -- about a young man (Cusack) who tries unsuccessfully to kill himself after his girlfriend breaks up with him -- is arguably the funniest movie of the bunch, though its wackiness fades in the big ski contest at the end.  ""Ferris"" is, for the most part, exactly what it purports to be:  viz, a feel-good movie about a boy who plays hookey.  It loses its compass in the beginning of the final act, but finds its way back on track in the final chase sequence.Like the other two, ""Heathers"" is a comedy, but it belongs in a different class.  It's about three girls in a high school clique, all of whom are named Heather;  and a fourth girl, Veronica, who has only recently been catapulted to their stratospheric levels.  The Heathers (and Veronica, Winona Ryder) are the cool girls, but they have a penchant for wicked practical jokes.  Veronica is having a few qualms of conscience, but she doesn't know how to deal with the problem other than by making vicious (and hilarious) entries in her diary.Enter J.D. (Christian Slater), a new boy in school, who knows how to pay wicked little girls back.  In the dark comedy that follows Veronica and J.D. start murdering Heathers.  And Jocks.  And just about anyone else they don't like.Where Heathers fails is that is doesn't go far enough.  EXTREME SPOILER.  In ""Heathers"" best scene, Veronica, feeling pangs of guilt, pushes a hot car cigarette lighter into her hand, and J.D. lights a smoke from her red-hot palm.  It's too bad the movie did not retain that attitude for the rest of the picture.It starts to go wrong -- remember, here there be spoilers -- when, at the funeral of one of  their victims (well, two) Veronica and J.D. start laughing.  A little girl with a sad face looks back at Veronica, and the horror of what they are doing begins to impress itself on Veronica's psyche.  In a dark comedy, death should be unapologetic.  But after this Veronica begins to pit herself against J.D.  And then J.D.'s character goes wrong and he launches into the old canard about how no one ever loved him.  Boo-hoo.After Veronica tries to stop any more murders the movie lurches off in the direction of a slasher film and it never finds its sea legs again.  It has one last superb moment EXTREME SPOILER (where Veronica, who missed an entire jock with a handgun before, is now such a good shot she's able to shoot off a single finger), but by that time the flick is moribund.Though it calls itself ""Heathers"" and poses as a murderous romp where the Heathers are all set up as excellent targets for homicide, Veronica and J.D. leave some of the Heathers alive at the end.So, ""Ferris Bueller"" is a success because it wants to be a feel-good movie and ends up that way despite a bit of bewilderment near the end;  but while ""Heathers"" starts out as wickedly funny dark comedy it almost become a message movie.  Too bad.And I hope that while I have remained tidily childless, all the friends I used to run around with, who were obsessed with how great ""Heathers"" was, now have kids nearing high school age.  That's the great thing about irony.  It's so ironic.",Heathers VHS

399530,"With ""Nixon"" director Oliver Stone aims for the next ""Citizen Kane,"" and he proves he's no Orson Welles.It seems odd that a movie sequel can be more melodramatic than its antecedent of fifty years ago but that's exactly the case here, a case made definite by Stone's silly juvenile plagiarism of Kane's beginning. In ""Citizen Kane"" there's the ominous dark cavernous mansion that bespeaks of a life so grand yet ultimately so empty, followed by the rush of reporters in a newsroom determined to discover the secret of ""Rosewood."" ""Nixon"" begins with the Watergate burglars meeting and planning, and then transitions to the White House on a dark night overlaid with ominous music, and then finally to a defeated and alone Richard M. Nixon (Anthony Hopkins).If Oliver Stone were to simply maintain this blatant plagiarism he would at worst be called a plagiarist, which is not really an offense in Hollywood or in life. Yet he trusts his intelligence and his taste and his instincts to create a powerful drama, and he shows that he lacks in all three.Consider Richard Nixon's historic meeting with Chairman Mao, who looks and speaks like the devil. ""You are as evil as I am,"" Mao tells Nixon. The melodrama and implausibility of the scene aren't enough for Stone: he has to overlay the scene with Chinese calligraphy and screamingly annoying music.In the beginning of the movie Mr. Stone has the courtesy to tell us that some scenes are redacted, shortened, or just dramatized from real life -- which is his most comic conceit because it's clear that MOST of the scenes have been imagined. Clearly Oliver Stone believes he is re-making ""Citizen Kane,"" and it is his duty to history to set the record straight once and for all about Nixon.Thus, we should know that Richard Nixon was fundamentally an amoral man whose conscience was his saintly mother (Mary Steenburgen), and then his mother's surrogate and wife Pat (Joan Allen). Indeed Pat Nixon is the film's moral center of gravity, and it is when she finally in 1968 relents to Nixon's relentless political ambition that she loses her moral authority and Nixon fall aparts.We should also know that Nixon's presidency was borne of the death of four people, and it was this that haunted Nixon and permitted him as president to sacrifice without remorse Cambodians, student demonstrators, and finally his own loyal White House staff. Tuberculosis killed Nixon's two brothers and permitted Nixon to attend law school, and Nixon's two deadliest political adversaries -- John and Robert Kennedy -- were conveniently assassinated.In fact Nixon, as the film claims, may have been indirectly responsible for JFK's death by being as Eisenhower's vice-president chair of a secret committee that sanctioned the killing of world leaders sympathetic to communism. As the CIA's Jesse Helms (Sam Waterson) explains to Nixon in one of the film's most outrageously implausible and embarassing scenes, what they created was ""organic"" and ""had a life of its own"": no one could have predicted these same individuals they had unleashed to kill Castro would have come back to kill Kennedy -- but then again no one made Nixon attach his name to documents linking him to these murderers.Stone tries to display different facets of Nixon's personality -- his outrageous paranoia, his self-hatred, his sexual insecurity and jealousy -- but what he best shows is Nixon's pettiness and shallowness and arrogance. And it may be because, despite Stone's professed high-brow cultural impact with his films ""Platoon,"" ""Wall Street,"" and ""Natural Born Killers,"" he is ultimately a petty and shallow and arrogant director. The film in its bloated morality and heavy-handedness treats movie-goers as children to be taught and admonished, as Nixon's mother once taught and admonished him and as Nixon taught and admonished the American people.""Nixon"" is a very flawed film of a very flawed man, and shows a director who we once respected to be very flawed as well.",Nixon VHS
118590,"Be warned, as you watch 'Eyes Wide Shut'; if you are expecting an erotic thriller, or a fast-paced suspense film, or a 'By-the-Numbers' formula picture, you will be disappointed! Stanley Kubrick always searched for  themes that would challenge viewers, and force them to see the world in a  different light. 'Eyes Wide Shut', his final film, certainly does that, and  is a film that will be enjoyed more with repeated viewings.What is  reality? This film challenges us to make our own conclusions, as we see the  story of a  Yuppie couple unfold. Tom Cruise, as the husband, has a  successful career, but is shallow and superficial, coasting along on his  looks and social contacts. Nicole Kidman, his unemployed spouse, is a good  wife and mother, but bored, and compensates by drinking and flirting, and  fantasizing about a Naval officer she'd seen the previous summer. As she  acknowledges her erotic daydreams to Cruise, he reacts, first with  jealousy, then with a desire to find an outlet for the sexual frustration  he feels. Thus begins nighttime odysseys into a dreamlike world of  discovery; of a friend's unfulfilled desires, of a dual-personality hooker,  of a teenager being pimped by her father, of a cult which may only promote  orgies, or may have a far more sinister intent.Nothing is spelled out,  or made obvious, and Kubrick throws in clues which will have you reaching  conclusions that you may find will change, when the film is viewed again!  'Eyes Wide Shut' demands your full attention, and rewards you with an  enigma! Is ANYTHING what it seems? The film's final line, delivered by  Kidman, is coarse, but totally in keeping with Cruise's journey, throughout  the film, and provides the director a wry closure to this most unusual  film!While 'Eyes Wide Shut' will never be rated as highly as '2001',  'The Shining', 'A Clockwork Orange', or 'Dr. Strangelove', it is  provocative and mysterious, and deserves your attention!",N/A
1006699,"Anyone who has seen David Mamet's work, knows that this writer is very complex. Seemingly racist or superficial dialog(s), always lead to a climatic ending. Although I have never seen ""Edmond"" as a play, the film definitely feels more like a play than a film. Quick dialogs and brief encounters lead us to a dramatic change in a life of a middle aged dilusional man. Edmond is 47 year old professional who suddenly realizes that he is bored with his life, his wife and work. On a whim, he decides to leave it all and pursue a search for higher self. The women who could give him excitement he is looking for, are all for hire (ladies of the night) and apparently - according to Edmond - they cost too much. Which tells us that Edmond was either married for too long, or ""born yesterday"". In the course of one night, Edmond's life changes completely. In the end, he is in place and time where he manages to: have time to meditate on purpose of (his) life, get over his prejudices (racial and otherwise) and finally break away from the boredom what was haunting him thru the last several years of his marriage. The end of this unusual thriller is worth ending several overbearing moments we are forced to go thru in the course of the movie.

I chuckled here and there but nothing was really funny in the film, which is a shame because the movie really relied on being funny.  Nothing too original about the story and the twists were fairly obvious.  The biggest disappointment was the heavy reliance on CGI backgrounds.  Behind the fog machines and actors were terrible backgrounds that looked more like screensavers.  I was hoping for a more moody, atmospheric tale, and instead I got poorly rendered backgrounds.

1191126,"""What Just Happened"" is an interesting and occasionally funny satire of Hollywood, but that's pretty much it.  The two main conflicts involve a dog killing and Bruce Willis's beard.  Most of the film is just Robert De Niro driving around town trying to resolve these two issues.  There is some meaningful drama between De Niro and his ex-wife, but it's underdeveloped.  I can't imagine *hating* this movie like others have, because there isn't much there to hate, and what's there is enjoyable, if not memorable.Bottom line: Despite the cast, this is a very low-key film that succeeds in what little it's trying to do.

1013001,"After watching this movie on cable recently, I didn't know what to think. Was this supposed to be a ""romantic comedy""? If so, maybe I missed something, because I failed to see any real humor in it. If anything, I found it to be rather sad - two people in a relationship suddenly finding all kinds of faults with one another until they decide to call it quits. And oh yeah, they just happen to share a condo together, but neither one of them wants to move out. I guess that was supposed to be the humorous hook in this script, but even that isn't very amusing. The whole story itself was conceived by Vince Vaughn, who I give kudos to for coming up with a pretty good idea. Because Vince was behind it, you would have expected it to be funny - not so. It starts off funny, but somewhere along the line, you stop laughing.I just never believed that these two could be a couple in the first place. After all, they had nothing in common. Vince as Gary is in partnership with his two brothers in a Chicago tourism venture, but he is also lazy, sloppy, loud, immature, uncultured and he reverted to his bachelor habits far too quickly for me to believe that he really had any feelings for Brooke (Jennifer Aniston). Brooke is an uptight, prissy, perfectionist-type who works in an art gallery and seems too much of a diva to find Gary to be appealing, not to mention entering into the kind of commitment buying a condo together would take. They are as mismatched as oil and vinegar and I just didn't feel like there was any on-screen chemistry between them. Off-screen, it might have been a different story for Vince and Jen, but that didn't translate well in this film. I found it hard to sympathize with either of their characters. All I saw was a couple constantly arguing, finding different ways to hurt each other's feelings over and over again, and demanding family and friends to take sides in their dispute. It was upsetting, not to mention tiresome. Again, there were some moments that make you laugh, but not enough to label this a comedy. However, I especially liked Judy Davis' role as Marilyn, the fiesty gallery owner and Brooke's boss.Like one of the reviewers mentioned, real love means accepting someone for whom they are and not trying to change them, which I thought Brooke wanted to do with Gary. She should have paid more attention to the type of person he was, because I'm quite sure he wasn't hiding those aspects of himself from her. She could have made the decision not to get involved with him. So basically, she knew what she was getting into. It should have been no surprize to her when Gary didn't want to do certain things or behaved in an immature manner. All of the pain they endure could have been avoided if she kept those things in mind.I will say, however, that the ending was totally unpredictable and I expected to see something else. This is not a bad movie; it kept me interested from beginning to end. But be warned - don't expect to laugh too much.",N/A

Obviously, the days of Platoon, NBK, and JFK are a distant, quickly fading, memory.  It is as if he felt obligated to finish a once promising project he lost interest in.  Brolin makes a good Bush and Wright does well as Powell but the rest are just poorly cast public image caricatures best suited for SNL.  The movie is surprisingly lighthearted, even mildly sympathetic in portraying a bunch of people who used a national tragedy and nonexistent evidence of wmds as an excuse to invade the wrong country.  War crimes.  Treason.  Bush and his camp, besides Powell, were arrogant, insular C+ students steeped in simplistic Manichean world views.  The world is suffering for their crimes of incompetence.  Bush isn't stupid, just weak, directionless, desperate to be liked, approved of by his father and, thus, prone to being bullied and condescended to.  Brolin portrays this excellently.  I think Bush really did believe there were wmds and was shocked and angered to realize he'd been the unwitting participant in a massive dupe.  How sad.  How sad for the world.",W

150522,"Miller and Mallory, the heroes of ""The Guns of Navarone"" are back, sort of.  We knew them as Peck and Niven, but little else but those two characters connects this movie with the 60's classic.  Here, Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Miller (Ed Fox)hitch a ride with an American special forces team into war-torn Yugoslavia on a mission to assassinate a turncoat partisan who is betraying Tito's forces to the Nazis.  Force-10, led by Col. Applebee (Harrison Ford), has its own mission and its own ways of getting into the battle zone - neither of which they discuss with Malliry or Miller.  On their way to Yugoslavia (actually, on their way to getting their ride to Yugoslavia) the crew picks up Weaver (Carl Weathers) a sergeant on his way to the stockade.  Things don't go as planned - even for Force-10's exceptionally pessimistic planning.  Mallory and Applebee soon find themselves forced to discuss each other's secret mission and find themselves dependent on each other to carry it out.This was a sort of good movie - ironically it would do better if we didn't think it had anything to do with the original ""Navarone"".  What otherwise kills the flick is that there's no central villain - Richard Kiel plays a monstrous Chetnick who baits Carl Wethers and the rest of us, but that's about all.  There's a high-ranking Nazi who puts in an early appearance and an almost as fast exit.  The biggest disappointment is the plot - save the partisans.  The partisan commander's antipathy to his Anglo-American allies stems from his suspicion that they consider his war theater a backwater, an idea the script does little to contradict.  Still, the flick is definitely worth a look - I actually enjoyed it, especially how it tries to look and sound like a war movie made a decade earlier, rousing music and all.",N/A

1276963,"Tony Scott returns once more to the action movie, and does the sort of slick production job we have come to expect from him, with trusty stalwart Denzel Washington along for the ride.  Though one has to say, that this time, he's not really on top form - we are well short of `Man on Fire' territory here.This remake of the 70's classic has the same circumstances unfolding but with a slightly different slant - taking away much of the cold and calculating side to the villain, and imbuing the Washington character with some backstory.  (He's under investigation, it turns out).  So, we still have a subway train hijacked, this time by a tattooed and heckling Travolta.  Washington plays the subway employee who happens to be the dispatcher when it all goes down, and his character works best while cooped up with only a microphone to liaise with the hijacker.  Sadly he fails to convince as readily when he is out on the street and in the subway to face off directly with Travolta's character.  John Turturro and James Gandolfini round out the supporting cast.The action, such as it is, is adequate enough, but never quite wrings tension in the way you feel it ought to.  In particular, one extended runaway train sequence never quite develops a sense of genuine threat , and the resolution to the scene never has the sense of relief / release it seems was intended.  The character development feels particularly broad stroked, lacking the sort of minor detail that convinces us enough to invest our emotions in the movie.  Washington's recent history feels shoehorned in rather than coming organically from the story, and when he starts playing the reluctant action hero, we are left chuckling at how unlikely it is, rather than feeling he is truly caught up in the drama.  As for Travolta, one is inclined to think he should just stop playing bad guys.. his character feels like an over the top panto villain, with a few lines of expositionary dialogue squeezed in to the script in an attempt to give him depth.  It doesn't work.  And then finally, in stark contrast to the original, the ending is all too predictable.So while the end result is a passable action movie with some genuine starpower, the bottom line is that those yearning for the intelligence and sticky tense atmosphere of the original will be disappointed, as will those expecting a bangs and bullets modern `Tony Scott' action movie.  It's a movie which is less than the sum of its parts - but the parts are still good enough to come through the muddle worth a couple of hours of your time, thanks in large part to a few dry comedic moments thrown in... as well as a few unintentional laughs along the way.",N/A
1413223,"Since it took a couple of years to even get on TV after it was announced I wasn't very surprised to see Terra Nova fail. The TV critics seemed to hate it, I remember one particularly vicious review in TIME magazine, but I didn't think it was all that bad myself.I loved the general look of the story but always thought the settlement looked like a resort dressed up to look like a small town, never quite worked for me. The plot line in general was weak in that a dying planet sends 100's of people through a tme rift (didn't  get much of an explanation for the discovery of this thing, thought the writers did OK for most of the rest of the ""science"") and there didn't seem to be much of an indication of qualification for making the trip. I would have liked to see some evidence,beyond an apple orchard, of anything to maintain/  build a new civilization ( wasn't it the bar keeper who had the only tech to repair/ replace damaged microchips?), that was about the least plausible part of the storyline.Many of the stories were standard Cop/family plots, a lot of that already on TV so that didn't help Terra Nova. The Dinosaurs mostly looked pretty good, much better than SyFy does- the worst bit of that when the little girl gives the "" baby"" back to it's mother. The casting wasn't too bad, Stephen Lang and Shelly Conn were best, ( the two girls were at least vaguely similar to her in coloring, the son didn't look like anybody).The expense of producing a series like this may have had as much as anything to do with its cancellation. The end of season cliff hanger indicated a storyline that could only get more expensive. With presumably weak ratings Terra Nova had no chance.Like others I would like to see some sort of conclusion but don't see a movie or miniseries in the future due to those expenses. Fan fiction to the rescue?At least one review complained about picture quality, I certainly hope that was their player and not the DVD, as the only way to get the show in HD (I've been told it looked great) is by download from Amazon or Apple, my data plan won't allow for that much online time.

339146,"It's true what critics say.  Nothing But Trouble isn't Chevy Chase's, John Candy's, and Dan Aykroyd's best comedy though it still entertains.  It truly is a lot like Beetlejuice though the ending is horrible.  Chevy Chase stars as Chris, a stock market whiz and millionaire who wants to go to Atlantic City with investment lawyer Demi Moore.  However, one small violation (Candy plays the cop who brings them in) leads them to Valikenvania, a whole place filled with wrecked yards and a big unclean mansion.  In there theyfind the 106 year old Alvin Valkenheiser (Aykroyd), a judge with a extreme grudge for bankers (he thinks Chase is a banker) and has ways to punish people for breaking the law.  And as Moore and Chase run through booby traps and rooms, they meet up with several ugly-looking characters (especially those two dirty fat man who Aykroyd plays).  John Candy also has another role as Valkenheiser's daughter (that's right, he has a girly part).  The script is not Academy-Award deserving but it's not the worst script you've ever read.  It's not a complete all star cast but who cares.  Aykroyd looks horrible in the movie and though some things are way too unbelievable, I thought it was an an entertaining and creepy movie with a little comedic twist thrown in.

619160,"***1/2 One of the marks of a truly great performer is the ability to appear alone on screen for long periods of time - without the aid of other actors or even dialogue - and still create a fully-rounded, easily recognizable character, using nothing more than gestures, body language and facial expressions.  Charlotte Rampling achieves just that sort of magic in ""Swimming Pool,"" an odd little psychological thriller that makes ""Adaptation"" look like a model of clarity, coherence and comprehensibility in comparison.  For the first twenty minutes or so, Rampling has the screen virtually all to herself and she definitely makes the most of the occasion.  She plays Sarah Morton, a successful author of murder mysteries who's become bored with the restraints of her genre and now feels the need to branch out and try her hand at different and more rewarding types of writing.  When her publisher offers her his villa in France as a place to get away and do some writing, Sarah jumps at the opportunity.  Unfortunately, after only a few days there, Sarah finds her peace and solitude shattered by the unexpected arrival of her publisher's nymphomaniac daughter, Julie.  Although there is initially a great deal of tension between the two women, a bizarre symbiotic relationship eventually develops, with Sarah secretly using Julie as the subject for her newest book and Julie feeding Sarah's morbid fantasies, first unconsciously, then consciously.For about two thirds of the film, writer/director Francois Ozon presents us with the classic - one might almost say stereotypical - conflict between a moralistic, sexually repressed, almost ""frigid"" British woman and a beautiful, uninhibited and sensual Continental nymphet.  But, as the story progresses, a certain personality transference begins to take place, with Sarah taking on some of the traits of the girl she professes to despise and Julie finding a way to ""help"" Sarah complete her novel.  I can't say that I completely understand the last half hour or so of the film, although I do suspect that the answer lies somewhere along the line of last year's ""Adaptation,"" which also dealt with the art of writing and the strange blending of the real and the surreal, of truth and fantasy that often accompanies the act.  Suffice it to say that you will either go with the film all the way to the end or tune out at about the 70-minute point.In addition to Rampling's amazing performance as the uptight middle-aged woman (one recalls, with a certain wistful amusement, that, in 1966's ""Georgy Girl,"" it was SHE who played the promiscuous femme fatale), the film offers us the beautiful and talented Ludivine Sagnier as Julie, a street smart kid who knows how to exploit her sex appeal for all its worth yet who occasionally displays moments of childlike tenderness and vulnerability beneath the hardened surface.You may end up scratching your head at the end of ""Swimming Pool,"" but I guarantee it will get you thinking.",Swimming Pool

1276560,"When it comes right down to it, Bewitched is truly a tale of two Dicks. Dick Sargent and Dick York. Ultimately the viewer must choose which Dick he or she prefers, as Darren. Its obvious from watching this series that Elizabeth Montgomery (Samantha) enjoyed working with both Dicks, and was very good at stroking thier huge egos. In this I agree with the expert, Franky Murillo. Its obvious she really worked hard at getting both Dicks to feel comfortable on the set so they wouldn't give any flaccid performances. She was able to handle both Dicks very skillfully, which helped the Series grow to its full potential. Its not an easy job to do, and its obvious she had her hands full at times. I think she preferred the first Dick over the second Dick, simply because he was bigger, in terms of stature. It would have been funny to have an episode in which both Dicks appeared at the same time, to see what kind of ramifications that would have brought. A double Dick episode you would have thought was a no brainer for this series, especially in Season 8. I think the viewer got shafted in not being able to see such an episode, but that's show biz I guess. Ultimately I found the second Dick a bit too stiff and lifeless in his role. Just didn't think he was penetrating enough to really make his mark. I thought the first Dick was much more animated and flexible in many ways, and when he got angry he turned real bright red. I have to hand it to both Dicks though, York and Sargent, they really exploded onto the sitcom scene back then, in roles that could have been embarrassing. Both Dicks really grew into their roles well, and inflated the value of the series, swelling the audience. While some of their antics were a little premature in terms of timing, both of them ultimately rose to the occasion in their own ways, and for that we fans of both wonderful Dicks are grateful.I have searched long and hard on the internet for this stuff, and its so gratifying to find these TV shows featuring both these Dicks in these Bewitched Box Sets!",N/A

Escaping from captivity a manhunt is launched for Kimble, led by U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (played in an Oscar winning performamce by Tommy Lee Jones).

The Blu-ray fares somewhat better in the audio department however with a very active, if average by todays standards, track. Where Warner does deserve high marks is inclusion of all of the special features from the Special Edition DVD including a feature-length commentary track with Davis and Tommy Lee Jones that contains a lot of good information despite some long pauses.

That chomp turns into one huge overgrown leech that inhabits the body of anyone within arms distance. Once the parasitic Jason has used a body to its full potential, it finds someone else to act as host.

It turns out that Jason will need to continue swapping bodies until he can get into the body of a family member. In this movie, there are 3. A mom, her daughter and the daughter's child. Because of his body swapping ways, the characters in the movie have a hard time determining which body is carrying Jason (though it's something the audience can easily discern because the hosts all act like lumbering zombies from ""Night Of The Living Dead). We get to see Dr. Voorhees and Officer Voorhees amongst other hosts.While I do enjoy this movie, it's been a while since I've seen it and oddly enough, I don't remember any of the kills so they must not have been too impressive. Also if I'm not mistaken, this is the only movie in which Jason is the murderer where we don't get to see his face. That's one of the things fans of this series have come to expect. Did they run out of ideas? Another thing I didn't like is once Jason actually finds one of the 3 family members, he enters her in a rather tasteless way. The movie makes up for it once the inevitable Jason death occurs. The way the death occurs isn't anything new but the effects are pretty good and then we see the great submerging of Jason and the legendary submerging of the famed hockey mask.Overall: Good edition to the series.",N/A
96393,"The merits of this landmark comedy are well known to moviegoers and don't need additional insight. The shock value of much of Brooks' humor has diminished somewhat with age, but it is still genuinely funny and rewatchig it for the umpteenth time  remains very enjoyable. However, I was very disappointed with Brooks'  commentary track. He rushes through it so quickly and finishes with his frenetic comments and concludes them before the movie is over. His non-stop filibuster is not coordinated  with what is occuring onscreen and offers minimal insight... very disappointing.",N/A

477444,"I have not seen another movie by this director-so I can not compare this DVD to his documentaries-but this movie is a small, heartbreaking, and hard to forget exploitation film.  The seductive cinematography allow us to see the Prague through the (mostly) sympathetic eyes of a 16 year old hustler (Merek) who happens to be gay (he seems to be one of the few male prostitutes in this film who is).  The travelogue-style opening shots of Czechoslovakia suck us in to the bleak nihilistic underbelly of post communist Czechoslovakian society populated by people who dwell on the fringe, surviving any way they can from one day to the next.  Apparently, when the fog of communism lifted from this part of the Eastern Block, fascism replaced it with its trademark culture of violence-in a post AIDS world.  But this becomes incidental.This motion picture is more like The Passion of Christ than My Own Private Idaho.  However, unlike Mel Gibson, this director mercifully spares us from many of the details of the violence inflicted, but the effects of that violence stay with us.  Intense, unflinching and gritty-at times difficult to watch, like an automobile accident in slow motion-the combined homoerotic and homophobic content (the inherent contradiction in this type of filmmaking) exploits the eroticism it condemns.  Not one of the cardboard characters who impacts Merek's downward spiral has many (or any) redeemable qualities-most are manipulative, self-centered and cruel.  Merek's youthful good looks and unsinkable innocence keep us watching, while his father's search for his prodigal son gives us hope.  One wonders why a filmmaker would become obsessed with the world of young male hustlers and wicked male predators.  Is this one self-loathing homosexual's effort to paint a picture of modern Babylon through an exploration of his own desires?  Or greed?  (Or both?)

917782,"If you don't know the original with Burt Reynolds, while not a horrible movie, this movie still has a big problem:  Adam Sandler is simply too small with too non-athletic a physique to be believable as an MVP quarterback from the NFL.  When the original came out in 1974, a six foot quarterback was still believable and the six foot eight giants of today were still rare.  Nowadays, someone who is five foot ten is simply too small except as a running back or a wide receiver.That aside, the movie does take a few twists from the original.  Some are good and some make the movie quite ridiculous.  I like the fact that the football to the groin is thrown at a crooked ref rather than a player.  One change I thought was particularly weak was making the idea of the guards playing the prisoners something new.  In the original it was something that happened every year, but the prisoners were simply beat up and the ""superstar"" was there to give them an edge.  Here, the quarterback is supposed build a team from nothing to a semi-pro quality team in a month.  I don't think so.  Another thing, Eddie Albert as the warden in the original is a lot more sinister than the mean but feckless James Cromwell is in this version.Anyway, this movie is about as raucous for our time as the original was for its.  However, the murder of caretaker is less gruesome and shocking in this remake than it was in the original.  If you want to watch Adam Sandler in a fairly mindless movie, this is OK.  However, if you want the better telling of this story, go rent the original 1974 movie with Burt Reynolds.",N/A

533091,"Movie Summary:  Man's man Nick Marshall doesn't understand women. Oh like all men he thinks he does, but he doesn't. Nick's life isn't so hot. He's never had a good relationship with any of the women in his life including his 15 year old daughter. But Nick Marshall is going to get the opportunity to change all that. One evening while waxing his legs, trying out mascara and hair mouse, Nick gets the shock of his life. He wakes up with the ability to hear women's thoughts. Now Nick can either learn from his new gift, or use it for his own selfish reasons.My Opinion:  This movie looks so good. The premise of Mel Gibson hearing the thoughts of women is really intriguing. The trailers are awesome. It's even really funny and interesting in the film. Until they have to wrap everything up and end the movie. That's when everything falls apart. The ending is terribly weak. It steals all the energy and laughter that it had going up until that point. It takes what should have been a really fun and entertaining movie and leaves it flat. It's still very much worth seeing once, but it could very easily have been lots better; a classic even. It's that disappointment that stayed with me after the film ended.DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic. Extras include trailers, commentary, and documentaries.

377071,"I first went here to Amazon to decide whether or not to watch this movie, and after reading the first line of the Amazon editorial review for the two-disc version which said,  ""There have been few better movies in the history of the planet than The Third Man,""  well, that, of course, was convincing enough, right? I didn't bother reading any more. After watching it twice (the second time to make sure I didn't miss something entirely), all I can say is, Mr. Jameson (the editorial reviewer), what planet do you live on? You've got to be kidding.Yeah, the cinematography is great, and film-school sophomores will ooh and aah over the black and white camera angles and dramatic use of lighting, probably ogling over that aspect so much that they miss completely the dismal nature of the story and characters, which I suspect most of the reviewers do also.Yeah, it's well acted too. And hey, it's beautifully lit. The lighting man should have gotten as much credit as Carol Reed. This leads to one of my most down and dirty complaints about this movie. Where's all that light coming from down there in the sewers in the middle of the night? Chase scenes through brick caverns which should be pitch black, and none of the main characters are carrying any form of torch or flashlight. Well,  they didn't need one. It was all so nicely, although somewhat dimly, lit down there. You could even see rats scurrying fifty feet away.The fiftieth anniversary edition which I have has an interesting little featurette showing actual film footage of those sewers, and yes, I'm right, they're pitch black--in the middle of the day no less--just as one would assume. Usually, I'll give a film some leeway on stuff like this, but sorry, the scenario is essential to the plot. Quite frankly, the way these scenes are, it's pure movie fantasyland. I guess for most people, you can get away with  anything in the movies, however preposterous.  If the Lone Ranger can easily jump his horse thirty feet from one canyon side to the other, then what's a little light down in the sewers where there shouldn't be any? Carol Reed must have known the sewers were actually pitch black. So did Orson Welles, So did Joseph Cotten, So did...etc., etc. No one said, ""Um,  Mr. Reed, you know, there's actually no light down in the underground sewers, especially in the middle of the night?"" Or maybe I missed that part where one of the characters, twice, turned on the sewer's master switch for all those mysterious bulbs down there which provided light, but yet, were nowhere to be seen? And then if that's the case, what's with those Russian police who show up later carrying torches? I guess Russians have really bad low light vision compared to the rest of us. Poor guys--short-sighted Commies.As for the story, how would you characterize it? Seems like it should be something called ""Pathetic Comedy,"" and on my second viewing I looked to see if maybe I  missed the crucial fact that it's actually supposed to be a comedy. It's got that ridiculous zither score, after all. The main character is a dope who is a dope throughout--must have been a dope all his life if he hadn't seen this coming in Harry Lime--and ends still a dope. He's a sucker for a woman who's a dope, and she's even worse yet--she's a dope in complete denial that she's a dope. Cotten's character doesn't seem intelligent enough to fully realized he's a dope, while the woman...well, it's hard to say since she doesn't say much besides, ""I loved him"" and ""I love him."" Not much else going on in that mind. She's like a walking zombie when we first meet her, and she ends the same way (great shot though). Poor Calloway, he was right all along--he's surrounded by cheap criminals and duped dopes.But wait, Calloway's a dope too. He never looked at the body? He didn't check the dead man's body and clothing for evidence and cause of death before they hastily put him in the ground? They had a formal inquest, but none of the inspectors looked at the body of one of their top suspects? Preposterous!! Fire the whole military police force. They're completely inept. The Keystone Cops would have done better. More fantasyland!Maybe it really was suppose to be a comedy. If so, it was all miscast. For the fun of it, imagine the Calloway character being played by Groucho Marx instead. Same mustache and with a  good cigar. He calls the dopes into his office to play, ""You Bet Your Life"":""Now Mr. Martins, say the magic word and you win a trip back home. Ok now, here's your question. If he walks like a criminal, and quacks like a criminal, then he must be...?""""My best friend?"" Quack. Sorry. Cue the zither.A lot of reviewers rave about Orson Welles in this flick. Why? His part is borderline cameo. His presence is minimal. Yes, he's got that wry Welles smile. How did this smart-looking guy end up in bombed-out Vienna, anyway? He speechifies for a couple of minutes--makes a clever few lines about the Borgias and the Swiss which actually has no pertinence to the story. I mean, is high art or engineering going on someplace because of this little underground clique of his? Is Vienna blooming into a new Renaissance because of the support of the nefarious? Did I miss the scene where Harry's shown funding a monumental marble statue of David? Maybe it was somewhere down in that big gloomy sewer tunnel. From my viewing, I didn't  see anyone in Vienna even making a cuckoo clock. Maybe Harry paid for the balloons. He did invite Martins to Vienna for some reason. Maybe by sponsoring Martins he was hoping his dopey friend would turn into the next Machiavelli and write a new version of ""The Prince"" based on himself, Harry Lime, except this time the Prince would be a gun-slinging cowpoke. Harry Lime is basically the most pathetic guy in Vienna, and his plight is almost comical. It's ""High Noon"" between the Pulp Western writer and the big-time loser in the black hat.That speech by Welles was ad-libbed. Guess he saw a need to actually give this character a little historically informed philosophical depth which Graham Greene forgot to do--pretend he's a little more than just a greed-driven jerk with a disdain for everyone. Well, that was the extent of it--maybe a minute or two of deep thought. Now, on to chasing the sewer rat. If you're looking for any surprise revelations after that scene, you'll be disappointed. I've read some saying there's layers of intrigue in this film. No there's not. There's one layer of criminal intrigue, a pathetic death, and a couple of dopes for whom, at the end, it all just seems to keep flying over their heads.Sorry folks, from my point of view, the script is weak. Questions about loyalty? Only a dope would find reason to remain loyal after that ferris wheel scene, loves or no loves. Calloway has to resort to tricks of graphic displays to conquer dopey--how pathetic.The Europeans seem to always get a kick out of portraying Americans as naive dupes. I'll tell you, that's what this film is about and I wouldn't doubt that it's one of the main reasons the movie made it to the top of the BFI's Best of the 20th Century list. The subconscious, after all, is a great ruler over our sense of pleasure. That ending is just laughing at Mr. Martins, the dopey American.Here's some telling facts. Graham Greene's original story concept had all British main characters, except for one American character. Guess who the one American character was. The American in Greene's original story was the Popescu character, who I would say seems to be the top dog, the shrewdest and most powerful of the criminal clique (Greene's original name for him was Cooler). So in the rewrite (by Reed?), the shrewdest character is changed from an American to an Eastern European, and the biggest dupe in the story is changed from an Englishman to an American (well, he's the biggest dupe besides the mentally ill Anna). Why the change of nationalities? Popular vote, maybe?My suggestion is, if you're into film noir, after you watch this one, go and watch Humphrey Bogart in ""The Big Sleep"" and decide which planet you'd want to be on. And if Orson were still around, I'd suggest to him that he go watch ""Chinatown"" again and then repeat his claim that there are no great performances in color (a claim that Peter Bogdanovich mentions in the special features of my DVD). In the history of film noir alone--on my  planet--I can think of a couple of films that I'd say are, at least, a little better than ""The Third Man.""Ok, so why don't you leave a comment or two along with the negative vote you're about to give my review. Try and address one of my complaints, maybe. How about the light underground. That should be easy. Try that for starters. But please, I don't think I want to hear any explanations for the zither. I'd rather not even  be reminded of it.Thanks for your time.**May 30, 2008: It's been more than a month since I posted this review and I've got 9 ""unhelpful"" votes, but no comments at all except a question mark. I'm really disappointed. No one wants to enlighten me as to what's wrong with my too long opinion of this movie? Go ahead, take a stab at me. Obviously, I'm not getting the bigger picture. Since I seem to be one of the few detractors of this film, I should be an easy target for the army of ""The Third Man"" enthusiasts.**",The Third Man VHS
1147219,"Yusef regains his sight (lost at age 8 after an accident with fireworks) at age 45 and discovers the world in which he was comfortable and cared for is no longer enough for him. The other reviews allude to the political metaphors with which one is faced whenever dealing with Iran. Majidi's beautiful vistas from The Color of Paradise and the Children of Heaven are not presented here, but are replaced by images that convey the fears and longings of a middle aged man suddenly awakened to a wide world. Yusef becomes aware of a pretty young student as well as the plainness of his motherly wife had been his caretaker all those years. There is some obvious filmic sympolism here, particularly when the wife ensures Yusef can find his wedding ring after he drops it on the floor while still bind. The problem is that she cannot do the same when he no longer needs her to function. Political loyalty works the same way, but any references to this are very subtle.Throughout the film, Yusef moves with the walk of a blind man, placing his feet down instead of sweeping ahead as he plods forward. Like contemporary Iran, he was formed as a blind man and cannot cope with a world with all the distractions of sight. As the tragedy of his situation dawns on the viewer, there is a sudden twist that either amplifies the tragedy or resolves it, left for the viewer to decide. This is a very thoughtful film and probably a great political parable (see Saramago's novel Blindness for more of that), but I missed the beauty of Majidi's earlier masterpieces.","Willow Tree, The"
1023384,"Superman returns after abandoning the earth for 5 years.  Upon his return, he saves a huge passenger jet from crashing.  Of course!  Superman was absent during 9-11!  This well-done action sequence is a poignant wish that Superman could have helped us on that day.  Where was he when we needed him?Two Jews invented Superman in the 1930's to fight the Nazi menace.  The new Superman is clearly a Christian product.  Superman dies; a Kryptonite blade stabbed into his side helps to finish him off.  He is resurrected to fight- but to fight what?  Perhaps for our souls.  This Superman is no super hero- he is a super savior.  Villain Lex Luthor calls himself Prometheus, the human savior in Greek myth.  So, this film is in the tradition of Godzilla versus King Kong: now, it is Prometheus versus Jesus.I saw the film in IMAX 3-D, and there is much to enjoy to see.  However, the 3-D sequences often look cheesy, and the action grinds on.  There are many fine details to savor, to enjoy, and to discuss, nevertheless.There is terrible news for sophisticated Superman lovers, however.  Superman is resurrected, but Clark Kent is dead.  In Superman II, Superman gave up his powers so that Lois Lane could love him as Clark Kent.  The point was: anyone can love Superman, but who can love Clark Kent?  Superman realized in that great film that his human love could not be, and he accepted his isolated fate.In 'Returns', Superman himself becomes vulnerable.  Lois Lane rescues him, and resurrects him with a kiss.  Superman thus becomes indistinguishable from Neo, the  hero in the Matrix.  Superman loses his true identity- which is as Clark Kent.Clark plays almost no role in this well done, but emotionally routine action flick.  The unique Clark-Supie tension is absent.  Now that Superman is 'vulnerable', and wishes only to be a family man, there is no need for Clark to represent what Superman can never be.The passengers in the jet plane that Superman saved gave him a fascist salute in thanks.  Astounding!  They were correct, however.  Superman now represents the merely charismatic perfection that we wish to attribute to political leaders and rock stars.",N/A

773676,"This is a very strange movie. Which is neither an insult nor a compliment.It's set at Christmas. In New Orleans. So no snow. And it's done in the style later called ""film noir,"" so there's lots of rain and shadows (rather than snow).It features former kiddie musical sensation Deanna Durbin. But she doesn't sing much. And she's no longer a kiddie. She's the femme fatale, the troubled woman who may or may not--I won't give it away--bring doom to one or more men.There are no holiday songs, although it does feature two very lovely songs: ""(I'll Be Loving You) Always"" and ""Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year."" The former is a classic song of romantic dedication. But in this movie, it's about a woman loving a wastrel, as they used to call guys what was no good.Gene Kelly plays the wastrel. (Are you getting the weirdness vibe yet?) And Gale Sondergaard, famous for playing dragon ladies, is Kelly's mother, and she is formidable during the moments she isn't being sweetly maternal (which are few).There's a tricky story structure in which a soldier who's been jilted meets Durbin. Durbin's story of loving a Bad Guy gives the solider a lot to chew on when it comes to love and romance. And that's the basic kick of the story: a young and inexperienced man hears a story that's so far beyond his ken that he grows up just by hearing it.But it's all very tricky. Durbin's story gets told in flashback and party backwards: she tells the sordid stuff first, then goes back to the sweet falling-in-love bits, which then seem foreboding rather than sweet. And basically her life then gets worse and worse--which brings the audience up to the present day, when the Durbin character is basically what used to be called a ""hostess""--a woman who danced with the customers to induce them to buy watered-down expensive drinks which allowed the bar to cash in at the male customer's expense.So it's not much of a Christmas story. (It was released in July, so the producers knew it was not holiday fare.) It's a dark romance.All this is fine. It's all kind of crazily, darkly enjoyable.And since Durbin was one of Universal's biggest star, director Robert Siodmak clearly had a decent budget: there's a Christmas mass, an orchestral hall which is shot in full during what seems to be an actual concert (or reasonable facsimile), and there are two- or three-story sets in which the camera follows the actors down and around complicated stairs and such. Clearly, the studio was spending money, and the director was having some fun fooling around with the camera.I have only two complaints. One is that although Deanna Durbin was a reasonably attractive person, she was not Movie Star Beautiful. Her face has a pudgy quality from most angles--except for one. That one angle is terrific: Durbin looks like a sweet little sister type with quite a bit of extra sparkle. But they only use that angle a couple of times.My second and larger complaint is that the movie uses Wagner's Liebestod, and that sets us up to think that at least one romantic couple will end up in a deadly embrace, and I won't spoil it, just say it's not quite that way. They seem to have softened the ending.In short, this is a very UNUSUAL movie, to say the least. But it's pretty well done. Is it worth what it costs to get something that's been more out-of-print than in? It's up to you. If you like truly offbeat material, this is your thing.But chances are most people will never see this movie.",N/A

822521,"I understand that Dirty Dancing movies aren't going to be exactly like Citizen Kain.  But when you think about the premise, the culture and classist clash of American vs. Cuban dancing, sexuality, and budding romance set during the backdrop of the Revolution, the movie sounds quite promising.  I mean, when I heard the premise I thought ""This movie was MADE for me,"" because it has Cuban history and politics, awesome dancing (or so I assumed it would, due to its predecessor,) and, come on, the main character has the same name as me.  But I should have realized then that a good premise does not necessarily lead to a good, or even adequate, execution.I won't summarize the movie as so many others do; if you want a synopsis, look to their reviews.  I WILL point out what exactly I found so lacking about it, and why I do not feel it was that good of a movie, even when one considers that it's ultimately just a dance movie.  But again one must remember that it was their decision to involve politics in the movie, and in doing so they made themselves fair game--I do not believe in just using a deep political situation just to make a story line seem a little deeper; if it is not handled properly, it is insulting.First off, the romance.  Diego Luna and Romola Garai had definite chemistry, and it is so disappointing when you realize that the movie did not capitalize upon this, and all you're going to see in addition to some very sexually charged dancing is a few hurried onscreen kisses and an implied sex scene.  Given their chemistry and the buildup of their relationship, their first kiss could have been so much better, instead of just snuck in during a dance routine--it was so quick I spent many minutes wondering if I had really seen it or not.  However, to me chemistry is not the only thing required in an on-screen relationship, and I have no idea to this minute why Javier and Katey fell in love with each other.  Katey's personality was developed in the movie sense (she likes classic literature, is a bookworm and rather progressive for her time) and Javier was clearly the ""will do anything for his family and feels that Cuba is in need of a change"" but I don't really know how those two fit together.  Aside from the sexual attraction component, I have no idea what exactly they saw in each other to make their relationship anything more than ""He was hot, she was pretty, and she felt sorry for him.""  Some might argue that Katey was merely attracted to the intensity and freedom of the Cuban lifestyle embodied by Javier, but I ask you: the movie was founded upon the idea of a romance, and what the heck kind of relationship is that?I would also like to add that the Spanish conversations WITHOUT subtitles were incredibly rude to the audience.  I do speak Spanish, but I could not make much sense of the slurred words and to this day I am wondering what exactly Javier and his brother said to each other after the Revolution broke out.  Maybe they figured that the audience would not care (pfft, what are politics compared to SALSA DANCING,) but I cared.And now, the historical components.  I will not get into the anachronisms--such as Katey's parents' attitude towards her staying nights with a boy they don't know, and that even Cuba in the 50's could not have been that unrestrained--as there are many who could do that better justice than I (apparently the style of dancing in the movie was unlike what was popular in Cuba at the time.)  After all, it is only a dance movie.  I can ignore that stuff.  But when the movie brings the history to ME I cannot ignore it, and I further dislike it when movie directors assume that their audience is completely ignorant of certain aspects of history and will just assume that ""Man, that Batista guy was a jerk; he didn't allow dancing.  Hopefully life will be better under this new regime!  Who'd they say it was, some guy by the name of Fidel Something-or-Another?"" (I am exaggerating; at least I hope that no one is that ignorant.)And here we get to the backdrop of the story, Revolutionary Cuba.  First off, Batista's regime wasn't really shown to be that bad; aside from the story involving Javier's father, it might as well have been that town in Footloose (perhaps a little more violent.)  It was like Dictatorship Lite.  After Havana falls to Castro and co., the Cubans act happy (which is understandable) but things are otherwise pretty calm, which one cannot imagine is really likely in such a situation.And then we get to the ending.  Katey asks Javier to come to America with her.  In a move which my sister has deemed the ""stupidest decision in a movie ever,"" Javier refuses, saying that he has to stay because of the Revolution, which he believes (or wants to believe, anyway) will improve life for him and his people, Batista killed his free-thinking father, viva la Revoluci&oacute;n, yadda yadda yadda.  I understand that movies don't always have happy endings, but I think that there is a middle ground between ""boy and girl live happily ever after"" to ""girl lives happily ever after and boy gets sent to the gulag after he finds out that Castro isn't exactly the nice guy he claims to be and wow, Batista was a cakewalk compared to this, and has to spend his years in a drawer cell where he would kick himself for his earlier decision if, you know, he could actually kick himself, but drawer cells don't allow that.""  I truly think that the filmmakers did not anticipate their audience to think this much, which is understandable, but come on--everyone knows that communist Cuba is no picnic, and when Katey says something along the lines of ""I know that we'll meet again,"" I couldn't help but thinking that the only way THAT would happen would be if Javier braves the Gulf and takes up Florida's wet feet dry feet policy.  In fact, when I told my friend about the ending he said, ""that boy is going to have to stop dancing and learn to convert his '57 Chevy into a boat.""I understand that people at first thought that Castro was fantastic and he didn't reveal his true intentions until later, but the fact remains that Cuba was politically instable and to choose to stay there instead of going to America was still pretty questionable.  And then Katey's optimistic ""We'll see each other again someday!"" was just waaaay too much for me.So, in short, if you're like me and you can't turn off your brain while watching a movie, this one's going to give you a lot of issues.  If you CAN turn off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is--a dance movie--you'll probably like it, though find some things (like the romance) lacking.",Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights
202853,"In 1983, director Joe Alves had given us the film, JAWS 3, the least and disliked sequel in the whole JAWS series.It has been another four years since Amity Island was again terrorized by a second killer great white shark. Now, in 1983, four years after the events of the second film, 21-year-old, MICHAEL BRODY (played by Dennis Quaid), son of Martin & Ellen Brody, who do not appear in this film, is now working at one of Florida's favorites, Sea World. His assistant is KATHERINE MORGAN (played by Bess Armstrong). Visiting Michael in Florida is Michael's younger brother, SEAN BRODY (played by John Putch) and his girlfriend, KELLY ANN BUKOWSKI (played by Lea Thompson, in her pre-Back To The Future days). Michael and Katherine have opened up an Under The Sea kingdom, where customers can go into this tunnel and see everything swimming around. Running this whole thing is CALVIN BOUCHARD (played by Louis Gossett Jr.), a man who happens to be completely ignorant, greedy, and stupid in not knowing that a great white shark, and her baby, have snuck right into the park. The sharks make series of deaths until, Michael, Katherine, and Sean finally kill them off, saving every fish and mammal in their park.Okay, I loved JAWS & JAWS 2, but JAWS 3 was really bad. The 3D effects have saved itself from having me give the film three stars instead of two. My two-star rating means I did not quite enjoy the film, but the 3D effects did boost up my enjoyment, so that's that. I did buy this film a while ago, not from any online stores, but I did buy the film, just to have all of the films on tape. But this sequel was pretty bad.",N/A
610749,"I honestly expected more from this film. I had spent many minutes watching teasers for this film, because I had to sit through previews at movies. I thought it looked imaginative. Although this was the case in terms of visual effects, the story was sub-par. At best.I love Pixar, and in my opinion they make the best films for Disney. My favorite of which was probably A Bug's Life. My review was most likely swayed by the masses of little kids and rock head parents.In the beginning, Marlin, Nemo's father, is having a conversation with Nemo's mother. Nearly instantaneously, a barracuda comes out of no where. In a dash to save her eggs, the mother lunges for a cave. Marlin tries to stop her, but is attacked by the large fish. The scene fades out, and fades in on Marlin. Plug your ears for this. On top of the fact that there are no funny scenes for the next fifteen minutes, let alone the rest of the movie, you will be swamped by nearly twice that time by kids asking their parents 'Where are the eggs? Where is the mother?' I felt like turning around and yelling in their faces ' She's dead! Can't you read between the lines? Jeezus, you would think the your parents wouldn't take an infant here!"" And the scary part is, I like kids.On top of this, there is no 'bad guy'. This movie floats along for two hours on a course for no where, like a piece of driftwood with holes, plot-holes, that is. Later on in the movie, Willem Dafoe's character, some forgettable fish whose name I have already forgotten, tells Nemo that 'All drains lead to the ocean.' WHat the hell is that? Drains lead to water processing factories where all waste, i.e. Nemo, will be burned in an incinerator.All in all, the reason this is even entertaining is the attention to detail. I give serious kudos to the animators.",N/A
109856,"This movie is a comedy/drama that was released in 1994 (you can tell by the hair styles!!) and was directed by Alek Keshishian. I don't think that Mr. Keshishian had directed any movies prior to this - he was most known for directing music videos for singers like Madonna. It stars Brendan Fraser (as Montgomery ""Monty"" Kessler), Joe Pesci (as Simon Wilder), Moira Kelly (as Courtney Blumenthal), Patrick Dempsey (yes, McDreamy, as Everett Calloway) and Josh Hamilton (as Jeffrey Hawkes).Monty, Courtney, Everett and Jeffrey are seniors and roomates at Harvard University.  Monty is dead set on graduating with honors in his chosen major - political science. He has opted to write his senior thesis on economics.  The thesis is decidedly conservative and espouses and subscribes to the theories put forward by Ronald Reagan during his tenure as president. One night, after returning from a long day of classes and research, Monty goes to work on his thesis but all of his data and the thesis on his hard drive are lost when power in the house is lost. Understandably, Monty freaks out because his hard drive is fried but luckily, he has a number of chapters printed out as back up, so he opts to go down to the library to make copies that evening, instead of waiting for the morning, as his much cooler headed roomates advised.  On his way, he breaks his ankle and loses the remaining hard copy down a steam shaft. When he finally gets into the library and finds his hard copy, it is in the possession of Simon Wilder, a homeless man that lives in the boiler room of Harvard's Widener library in spite of being a former Merchant Marines. Simon also has a lot of health problems, including asbestos inhalation that was never identified and treated.  This movie details the impact that Simon, Simon's experience and his knowledge has on the four roomates, and, most notably, on Monty, whose entire worldview changes as a result of this interaction.I enjoyed this movie, not because it really packed a punch or was a movie with a message (a la Hurt Locker) that was being forced down my throat but because it was a pleasant, easy to watch movie.  It's one of those movies that you can watch that is comforting in the sense that it doesn't really push the viewer but is really high in entertainment value.  I enjoyed watching the actors and, quite frankly, I enjoyed the nostalgia of seeing Harvard, Cambridge and the Charles River in some scenes because those days were a little easier for me. And I loved Cambridge very much. Still do. The cast was wonderful, even though the movie itself could get a little saccharine and cheesy and the plot a little predictable. I also really appreciated that this was a college movie - a movie about college students - where the students seemed to try to figure themselves out as people - to increase their depth and figure out their roles in the world, instead of just trying to figure out how to get beer, more money, more pot or how to get to White Castle. They tried to navigate the moral battles that they were given and to learn from them, and I appreciated that this happened in this movie, whereas in other movies, that doesn't always happen. I really enjoyed it in general, even though it wasn't a critically acclaimed movie.This is one you should add to your collection.",N/A

288360,"Viewed: 7/09Rate: 67/09: The Teahouse of the August Moon initially had me under the impression that it was going to be a Brando film. However, that was not the case at all. In fact, he only had a very minimum presence, but that didn't mean the film was terrible. On the contrary, I enjoyed it only to a certain extent. Glenn Ford clearly stole the show as he portrayed himself an affable solider who showed a change of heart through seeing effects on his attitude after experiencing a culture change. The result was quite enjoyable and sensible fun. On the other hand, I found the film to be quite unconventional and sometimes awkward to watch. One distracting part about it is the sight of Marlon Brando's face as if he just came back from a major Botox treatment. It would make a lot more sense if he was eliminated from the film altogether and be substituted with a real Japanese actor. Nevertheless, Brando did a magnificent job disguising himself as a Japanese because I couldn't tell many times if it was him or not. Some parts of the film were slow and didn't add much to the overall story. That caused choppiness in the pacing of The Teahouse of the August Moon.

212677,"Hoping to cash in yet again on the heels of the hugely successful second ""Star Trek"" film, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"" (1982), Paramount Pictures produced a third film for the franchise entitled ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"".  This third film took on a new dimension by being directed by the actor who had played the character of Spock for over 10 years, Leonard Nimoy.  This was not Nimoy's first time in the director's chair as he had previously directed two episodes for two different TV series, but it was his first directorship of a big-screen motion picture.  Joining Gene Roddenberry again for writing was Harve Bennett, who had helped to write ""The Wrath of Kahn"", as well as Leonard Nimoy, whose writing was not credited.Though Spock's character was killed at the conclusion of ""The Wrath of Kahn"", the door remained open for his potential return since his body was left on the Genesis planet, which was a living planet created out of lifelessness.  Still mourning Spock's death was the U.S.S. Enterprise crew: Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Commader Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).  Kirk is visited by Spock's father, Vulcan Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard), who inquires about Spock's soul.  After a mind meld that confirms that Kirk doesn't have Spock's soul, the two review the events just prior to Spock's death and realize that Dr. McCoy has Spock's soul.  Sarek explains Dr. McCoy must be brought to Mount Seleyah on Vulcan along with Spock's body in order for both to have peace.  Placing his friends above everything else, Kirk and the other primary Enterprise officers decide to steal the Enterprise to return to the Genesis planet, which Starfleet Command has made a forbidden destination.  Having been heavily damaged in the battle with Kahn in the previous film, the Enterprise was decommissioned, but Scotty manages to secretly prepare the ship for departure.  Meanwhile, the Genesis planet is under study by Kirk's son, Dr. David Marcus (Merrick Butrick), and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis); but a determined Klingon captain, Captain Kruge (Christopher Lloyd, known more being the 'Doc' in the ""Back to the Future"" films), wants to obtain the Genesis technology for the Klingon Empire.  The development of the Genesis technology by David Marcus and his mother, Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), was a feature in the previous film ""The Wrath of Kahn"", but Bibi Besch did not appear in this third film.  Also, Lt. Saavik, whose character was introduced in ""The Wrath of Kahn"", was played originally by Kirstie Alley (best known for her character of Rebecca Howe in the long-running TV series ""Cheers"").The most memorable scenes in ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"" include Sarek's visit with Kirk, McCoy's occasional Vulcan behaviors, McCoy's conversation with an alien (Allan Miller) in a bar, Lt. Uhura's conversation with 'Mr. Adventure' (Scott McGinnis), the Enterprise leaving space dock, David's fight with a Klingon (David Cadiente), the abandonment of the Enterprise, the end of Kirk's fight with Kruge, and Mount Seleyah with T'Lar (Judith Anderson).  With Leonard Nimoy absent during most of the film, much of the action depended primarily upon William Shatner, who is not the greatest actor.  The best acting in the film came from James Doohan, DeForest Kelley and Mark Lenard.  Sadly, the sets used for the Genesis planet were not very realistic and much of the action that takes place on its surface was not particularly memorable.  The unexpected Vulcan boy who ages rapidly was played by four different actors: Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis.Overall, my rating of for ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"" is only 3 out of 5 stars because of the lackluster acting during much of the action scenes, poor set design, and anticlimactic ending.  The film does have some good points and is worth watching, but could have been much better in my opinion.  I don't necessarily recommend purchase of the film on DVD, but it does fill in the gap between ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"" and ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"", which are two of the franchises best films that were ever made.",N/A

516164,"I really wanted this movie to be great. I really felt that it had the potential. And you know, it started out pretty good. But the longer the movie goes the weaker it got. It was almost like they started with half a script and when theu got to the end of that they just winged the rest.The premise of the film is that a gang called the rebels had pretty much taken over the streets of this urban Indiania neighborhood. They are extremely bad and horrifically violent and refuse to let anyone get in their way. One citizen see's one of the gang kill a high school basketball star and calls the cops. The gang retailiates by trashing his store, beating him up, shooting him, and leaving him for dead. Enter John Bookman.Bookman (Fred Williamson) is the son of the shop owner, an ex-NFL football star, and, it turns out, the original leader of the rebels some 30 years ago. He returns home to find a war zone. After failing to start a dialog with the gang with the help of the local preacher (Paul Winfield) he turns to his old comrads-in-arms to try and take back the streets.Joined by his best friend from the gang days (Jim Brown), who has his own demons to over come (the son he never knew had just been killed by the gang) they begin to orchestrate a neighborhood revolt. Joining them is Brown's old girlfriend and the mother of his son (Pam Grier), and a couple of ex-gang members (Richard Roundtree, Ron O'Neal).Here is where the problems begin for this movie. After this great set-up it starts to deteriorate into just pure violence. A previous reviewer says this movie has a ""deep message."" What's the message, that you have to become as vicious and brutal as the gang you're trying to stop? We see people being executed with a bullet to the brain, burned, having their necks snapped, knifed, beaten with baseball bats, and just gunned down in a all-out hail of gunfire. As the heroes continue their onslaught we see that in the end, they really are no less violent and brutal as the gang. In the final scenes we find Williamson & Brown in a fight with the two current gang leaders while a rival gang looks on. Once they dispose of the hoodlums finally the police, missing completely during the firefight, show up. What started out good ended silly.

1416695,"This movie seems to have polarized viewers and reviewers. Paid reviewers, for the most part, have not liked it. John Q, on the other hand, seems to have liked it a lot....for what it is.Here's the scoop. Theseus (Henry Cavill) needs to find the Epirus Bow before King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) finds it and uses it to set the Titans free to decimate all mankind. Theseus will get help from a virgin oracle and the Gods themselves to accomplish this mission.I like the director Tarsem Singh. His first outing ""The Cell"" was a decent script with a great look. His follow-up ""The Fall"" was a great script with a great look. ""Immortals"" seems more the child of the producers. It looks as though they were trying to capitalize on the success of their earlier ""300."" The overall look is very similar but I have to imagine Singh had a big hand in this. The costumes and set design are extensions of his earlier efforts. This movie looks great. Every shot is a feast for the eyes. The effects are seamless and the slow motion violence is really cool. Seeing heads explode like this is.....unique.Cavill has a good, heroic screen presence. Rourke plays a great villain. He is so casual about killing it made my skin crawl. Freida Pinto as Phaedra is a real knockout. Stephen Dorf was good as Stavros but he seemed out of place somehow. John Hurt and Stephen McHattie were good in their small-ish rolls. One review I read complained about the slowness of it. I can't say I disagree but, at the same time, I wasn't getting fidgety so it mustn't have been too bad. This is an epic, myth based movie. Tarsem Singh does a lot to bring the sense of myth to the look and feel of it all. I'm chomping at the bit to see his upcoming ""Mirror Mirror.""I cannot say I liked this quite as much as ""300"" but this is still a heck of a ride. When it hits Blu-Ray I will definitely add it to my library. It will stand up to repeat viewings.",N/A

It's kind of like that.  It's like an episode of The World's Dumbest Criminals or The World's Dumbest Hostages.  The ending somehow doesn't feel satisfying, because everything that comes before it just gets lamer and lamer.  It is well-filmed and directed, though.  I give three stars for Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman, and the daughter who looks like a young Sasha Grey.

638288,"Another solidly packed midnight preview screening and the film clocks in at over 3 hours!Well, where to start, eh?I've avoided the trailers, reviews, posters, etc, so that my experience would not be tainted by advance publicity. Thus, I sat in the theatre like a newborn virgin expecting the first tinges of excitement.The script, although containing several new plot threads, follows the classic formula set down by the original film. The first hour is spent building up the characters, setting up the mystery and allowing some comedy elements to seep in.Jack Black, who I normally abhor, is acceptable in his role as the megalomaniac director pursuing a doomed project, Adrien Brody has enough charm in his eyes to carry off his role as secondary hero, Andy Serkis as the ship's cook and Kong is simply awesome, Noami Watts lacks the raw eroticism of Jessica Lange and the primordial energy of Fay Wray but she bestows her role with acres of bubbly charisma. The chemistry between her and Kong is palpable and time is given to showcase their tragic romance.The film has been lovingly created by Peter Jackson and his team of film magicians but there are several moments where the CGI effects look flakey and unvarnished. However, the pacing never wavers and any technical deficiency is easily overlooked by the sheer scale of the adventure which rampages across the screen. The artistic design of the film is beautifully realized and no expense has been spared in creating a mammoth world of danger and suspense. The natives of Skull Island are terrifying in a hallucinatory manner (someone should immediately give Jackson a CANNIBAL / ZOMBIE project next).Those amongst us who may deride the film for lacking any intelligent muscle, I simply say just take a moment and ponder upon the sly political subtext that Jackson has weaved into his film. The allusion to recent world events and the ensuing bloodshed is laid bare in the poignant climax. There is also much made of Joseph Conrad's THE HEART OF DARKNESS in the banter between the cabin boy, Jamie Bell, and the ship's Second Mate.The soundtrack, as with the recent NARNIA, never really soars and the main love theme lacks the melodic emotional resonance that should impale the hardest of hearts when Kong and his love spend a few tender moments as the sun sets on their world.Okay, the film may not be as groundbreaking in the way the original one was, but it still has tons of innovation and high octane adventure to capture the minds of most people.Recommended.",King Kong

However, they soon discover a video of a young boy that resembles their son taken from a small village in Burma, and they set off using any means necessary to bring back their child. A blaring title sequence opens VINYAN with an air of pretension that is carried on throughout the rest of the picture. Frabrice du Welz' English-language premiere is light on character, but heavy on aesthetic and atmosphere. The eerie psychological-thriller follows a similar plot progression to Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, traveling deep into the misty jungles and deeper into the darkest recesses of the human mind. Welz' camera goes into all-wheel-drive as it tears through the jungle paths and splashes into the sea right alongside each of the characters in a rough but calculated shooting style. Although Emmanuelle Beart and Rufus Sewell provide strong performances, their portrayals of the distant Jeanne and reactionary Paul garner little support in their hunt for their missing son. VINYAN's spooky settings and frightening look at human trafficking make for a unique watch, but the thin plotting and vague ending will leave many viewers wanting more.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Vinyan
1560707,"although the movie was pretty good it falls short of my expectations, as did Oblivion, however I though Oblivion was slightly better.It's a new type of movie where they are keeping budgets smaller with fewer actors involved and more pure CGI animation.  With Smith in the movie and a total cost of $130 million to make it most of the budget with to the programers no doubt.The movie was for the most part very predictable and the CGI imagery was very good.  Appeared that much of it was shot in the redwoods on the coast of california in the smith river area, very beautiful area.At the end it said story by Will Smith, it was a good movie as i said but just not what I was expecting.  This is smart money I would say for huge movies but screen plays are limited and harder to evolve with the lack of actors.As with the movie ""Buried"" with Ryan Reynolds, it's does a great job with what he had to work with but left many viewers expecting more, you will find the same with this movie.I somehow feel that big budget movies are evolving to this type of movie, not many actors and TONS of CGI.

36277,"I don't care for anything John Carpenter has directed after 1982's ""The Thing"". However, I am a fan of H.P. Lovecraft's literature, and I do like Carpenter's earlier films, so when I was in the rental shop the other day I thought I'd give this film a viewing. I'm glad I did.""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is not an actual H.P. Lovecraft story; nor is it based on H.P. Lovecraft's work. It is, however, styled on and after H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos and short stories. And the film, like a fungus, grows on you. Should you not be too impressed with it on the first viewing (as I was not), I recommend watching it again.The premise of ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is about a fraud squad detective (Neill) hired by a publishing company to find the whereabouts of a mysterious best-selling horror novelist, as well as to look into the growing hysteria surrounding readers of his books.The performances are first rate, the story engaging and thrilling, the locations are colourful, and the cinematography, music, and special effects work very well in complementing the aforementioned. What's particularly interesting about this film is the style with which it opens: very Stanley Kubrick. And Carpenter certainly doesn't waste any time, either: there's never a dull moment in this film. And despite some big name seasoned actors in the cast, Sam Neill (who's become a big name himself) absolutely steals the show. ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is an extremely well done, professional film with a fairly original story. And Lovecraft fans will definitely see familiar Lovecraft elements and creatures in this film, as well as get the disorienting feeling, albeit a shallow one, that Lovecraft implements in his stories about a particular narrator going mad, etc.But the film isn't without its share of downsides. For instance, I can't say that I really felt the credibility of the ""madness"", myself. It is because of the cerebral condition involved in madness, a condition that only a reader through his or her imagination can realistically conjure up and interpret, that I believe Lovecraft's work untranslatable to the big screen. In addition, I can't say I found anything in the film particularly scary, either. Eerie, perhaps - maybe even tense. But scary, no. With all the usual John Carpenter ""stingers"" and horrific creatures and sequences, I'm led to believe that this film was supposed to be scary. (I think, perhaps, I've just seen too many horror films that use the same old tricks, which this film is guilty of, to be scared by any of them anymore. Of course, should this film have come out in the early 1980s, I would've certainly been scared.) However, I did get confused, ""taken"", and muddled, as there are a good deal of twists in this film that are meant to disorient the viewer. In fact, there are so many twists that the viewer will come to expect them - which ultimately kills any kind of credibility of any particular scene henceforth. This is a problem. Another downside is the editing: certain shots should've been deleted from the film entirely to leave something to the imagination; other shots should've just merely been briefer to give more impact to the shot.However, despite the drawbacks I mentioned, which may not even be a factor for some viewers, ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is the kind of Horror Thriller that will withstand the test of time and that one will be able to appreciate and enjoy in more than one viewing. Personally, I would've liked to have seen some deleted scenes interwoven in this film, myself, to have it fleshed out more.",N/A
532901,"First of all let me say that I have never played the Dungeons & Dragons game before.  I'm familiar with only the Saturday morning cartoon and a couple of the books.  Being a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I was always aware of D&D;, but never pursued any interest any it.  Having said that, I was surprised at how decent this movie really was.  Granted, there are a ton of films that are a lot better than this fantasy flick, but it was a nice way to kill a little time on a Saturday morning.  There were some good and some bad things about this film.  Here's a look at all of them.First of all, the guts of this story were very good.  The tale of two thieves and their cohorts seeking out a powerful sceptor has been told before, but it is played out very well in this movie.  It's plays out at a rather quick pace and never gets boring.  Justin Whalin, Marlon Wayans, and their group are all excellent in this film.  Bruce Payne was also a perfect foil to their plans.  I actually felt a little sorry for his character.The special effects were okay considering the massive amount used in this picture.  They don't take away from the story at all.  The battle of the dragons was done pretty good, though I wish we would have been given a larger dose of the action.It was very nice to see Tom Baker on the screen.  Fans of the BBC series ""Doctor Who"" will remember him as the beloved fourth Doctor.  I'll be honest and say that I didn't recognize him initially, but when I realized who he was, it felt good to see him once again.The movie gets pretty ugly when, unfortunately, Jeremy Irons or Thora Birch enters the frame.  Irons seems to be overacting in an attempt to be the dreaded nemesis he is supposed to be.  It's funny how sometimes Irons can be such a brilliant bad guy, and then stumble his way through a film such as this or ""The Time Machine.""  Birch is completely out of character in this movie.  She is such a good actress in her other films(American Beauty, Ghost World, etc.), but she doesn't seem to be able to grasp the character she is playing.  I would think that such a radical character would have been played with more emotion, or at least some emotion.  The ending is abrupt and uneventful.  Sure, the bad guy gets his in the end, but the ending only serves as a point to quickly shut the movie down.Once again, the real story, the better story, is between Whalin, his friends, and the character portrayed by Bruce Payne.  Had they been the entire focus of the film, it probably would have been much better.Recommended to folks who enjoy fantasy but don't take it too seriously.  In other words, if you play dress-up on days not associated with Halloween or a Renaissance festival, you probably won't like this.",Dungeons & Dragons

101812,"Viewed: 12/08Rate: 612/08: All the President's Men is rather an ordinary real-life detective movie that is buoyed enough with good performances. I can't honestly say that I was enthralled because it wasn't that exciting. Surely, there are good moments in the chase of the paper trail, and that's pretty much it. I have to say that Jason Robards' performance is very overrated. There was more fun for me during any of Nancy Drew movies or JFK than what's contained in All the President's Men, so I am slightly disappointed about the outcome. If there is anything to complain about, I thought the information given was rather full of holes. A name just appears out of nowhere, and some juicy tidbit suddenly comes into play, disallowing audience's participation during the sleuthing trip of Woodward and Bernstein. Even worse, for somebody like me who is not very informative of what had happened that time, All the President's Men didn't fill in the details for me that well. I guess I'll need to read a book on that, if I am motivated to do so. All in all, All the President's Men is nevertheless a good film but not good enough for repeated viewings mainly because of the boredom factor.",N/A
104700,"Toward the end of Hammer Films' reign as THE horror movie studio, they decided to transport the Dracula character into the modern era. This was the first of two films where Dracula stalked the Swingin' Seventies.The best part of this film, sadly, is the dynamic opening sequence in which we bid farewell to the psuedo-Victorian age of the old Hammer Dracula--a battle between a Van Helsing and the Count on top of an out-of-control carriage. While there are occassional glimmers of similar excitement later in the film, this is as good as it gets. Dracula's death scene is also pretty nifty, even if he is (once again) dispatched almost as much by accident as by the actions of the hero.The biggest flaw are the thirty-year-olds that are cast as teenagers. Making matters worse, they aren't particularly good actors to begin with, so their lack of youth becomes even more distracting as the film unfolds.The only real bright spot in the flick is Peter Cushing who portrays a modern day decendent of his original Van Helsing character--sort of. There are some weird continuity issues that were probably invisible back when the film was released, but if one is anal (like me) and watches ""Horror of Dracula"" in close order to watching this one (like I did), the quirk screams out at you. Maybe there are really TWO Hammer Dracula storylines embodied in this series, rather like what happened with the Frankenstein one? (That could certainly explain the sadistic side that Dracula starting showing when Hammer Films entered the Seventies.)But, that's really a nitpick that has little impact on the overall film.It's a fact that Cushing delivers the only noteworthy performance here, with even the much-lauded Christopher Lee coming across as tired and slightly bored in the few scenes he appears in. The biggest strike against Cushing in this flick is a problem with the script; he is touted as a brilliant scholar and researcher, yet he has to work entirely too hard to figure out that the mysterious Johnny Alucard's last name is DRACULA spelled backwards! (Maybe itIt's an unfortunate fact that there are few truly chilling moments in this flick. The Satanic rite in the church where Dracula is returned to life isn't bad--although it would probably have been stronger if the actors involved had been better and had been a little closer in age to the teens they were portraying--and Van Helsing's confrontation with Johnny Alucard is also appropriately suspenseful, but that's about it. Even the final confrontation between Dracula and Van Helsing is rather ""eh.""This is the weakest entry in the Hammer Films Dracula series, with Peter Cushing earning it a full extra star all by himself. View it primarily for the prologue and as a stage-setter for the far superior ""The Satanic Rites of Dracula"" (aka ""Dracula and His Vampire Bride"").",Dracula a.D. 1972 VHS

One of the best features of this set is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.

The trailers included on this set are for D.Gray-man, Mushi-Shi, The Slayers, Black Cat, Soul Eater, and S.A.V.E.Overall, the episodes on this disc are rather enjoyable.

The cast kept promising that this movie was going to be more mature and not as corny, but it turned out to be no different from the original movie series. True, you have to have some of the old cliches or it wouldn't be Friday the 13th, but it also makes it unoriginal. I am a long time fan of this franchise and I can tell you that this wasn't the best, but luckily also wasn't the worst.One thing that bothered me in the movie was how Jason would be in the yard and then be on the roof of the cabin a second later. It works for zombie Jason since he has supernatural powers, or that you can believe, but this Jason is supposed to be alive! There is no way that he could pop out of all of these different places unles he had some portal I didn't know about and never show. Another thing is that Jason can take a hit with a sledge hammer better than he can take a kick in the face. It's kind of funny that he snaps hammers in half by blocking, but is slowed down when the main female character of the movie kicks him.What I did like about the movie was the few minutes at the beginning of the film with Nana Visitor as Pamela Voorhees. She was incredible with the few minutes she was on and did a fantastic Betsy Palmer voice. I almost felt that she deserved her own movie more than this movie. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It was  nice to see Jason return to Crystal Lake because this is where he belongs. Friday the 13th (2009) is the best movie since Part VII, but I was just disappointed it wasn't anymore original since this was a reboot.

But as the show progressed it began to turn to be just like all the other teendramas on WB54; The brooding teenage boy meets the 'The girl every-guy wants, with a dark past' young blonde girl (daughter of a Doctor who becomes rivals with Ephram's father, who reminds me of ""Squidward"" of Sponge-bob square-pants) and eventually develops feelings for her later on in the show, everyone in high-school has to be ""together/couple"" when in reality its not like that all, the dramas concerning the young girl Delia is mediocore but its believable, and the teenagers, (who are, naturally about as wise as a undeveloped tomato) always ends up correcting the Parents on everything instead of the other way around.The only real change is the more focus on the adults and their troubles. At least it was before the ""O.C"" and ""One-Tree Hill"" Reared their ugly heads. Teenagers who are into the heavy-drama type shows will enjoy ""Everwood"". It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, sadly.------- [a 3 out of 5]",Everwood: Season 1

The speical effects are good, gore is decent but still good, but the story sucks. It kind of reminded me of Highlander with the sword fighting and then giving the Djinn humour wasnt a good idea. Still enjoyable to watch. The speical features are pretty cool on the dvd. The even have a Q and A with the Djinn about dating. Yea, I dont know what to say about it.

This controversial film is about no matter how well we know each other, there is still racial tension living right under the surface. All it takes is some pointless argument about a picture on the wall or a radio being played too loudly, for racism to rear it's ugly head on both sides. Then what happens? People are dead, businesses are ruined, and communities are rioting. Over what? The argument is but a mere spark, racism is the issue. Had the argument been between two black men, instead of a white man and a black man, things would have turned out much differently.

1334121,"If this movie helps anyone with a substance abuse problem, then it will have served a noble purpose, but the film, despite decent, if at times slightly over-acted performances, possibly due to trying to squeeze too much into short scenes, didn't exactly carry me along, even though I like the actors.  The romance between the two main characters was not convincing to me, although Maggie Gyllenhaal's mastery of the erotic was excellent, as always.The inconsistent editing gave a disjointed air to the movie (e.g. see the excellent comment by reviewer Mark Blackburn about the missing scene), while the cinematography was very good, and the sound quality was excellent as well, the latter two qualities being well served by the blu ray release.Maybe it was just me, but it seemed like the main character's music was better when he was dysfunctional, and a little on the boring side when he was functional.The movie also seemed like a bit of an Alcoholics Anonymous recruiting vehicle, which is fine for people who are helped, but struck me as a bit tedious and heavy handed.My two favorite scenes, in addition to Gyllenhaal's carrying the love scenes, were at the beginning when Bad gets out of his truck and emptys out the jug, and his back and forth with the sound man during a rehearsal for an opening an act for a concert by Tommy.  Jeff Bridges and Colin Farrell both give convincing musical performances, and Robert Duval is always fun to watch, although his cameo appearance is brief.And, it would be churlish not to mention the wonderful performances by the back up bands who perform in the movie, and, once again, the excellent sound engineering.",Crazy Heart

1500958,"Of the Oscar nominees I have seen, this one is the most entertaining although its also the least ambitious on account of the fact that its pretty much a suspense-thriller. The film is a highly fictionalized version of a real-life hostage rescue operation that allows Affleck to direct himself playing a hero. Its like a really good television drama like Raid on Entebbe (1976) but with slighly higher production values and an excellent soundtrack (Stones, Van Halen, Led Zep). I think it wants to be Dog Day Afternoon or All the Presidents Men but neither the characters nor any of their individual stories are particularly interesting, the gimmicky operation (a cheesy space epic with an Orientalist twist) is the star of the film. Affleck doesn't act so much as play straight man to zany John Goodman and zanier Alan Arkin (who really provide much of the entertainment value). The film succeeds at capturing the time period (by seamlessly joining historical and pseudo-historical footage of the actual revolution and storming of the embassy), and it succeeds in manufacturing just the right amount of suspense to keep viewers on the edge of their seats without wearing them out with too much political complication. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Lincoln. Its a perfectly competent film about a very outlandish CIA operation but it doesn't try to make any kind of comment on terrorism. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Zero Dark Thirty. Its the perfect film for people tired of politics and of thinking (if the film wins Best Pic on Sunday, its probably because thats the mood of the country right now). But if you want an even better film about terrorism in the Seventies, I'd recommend the award-winning HBO miniseries Carlos (Olivier Assayas, 2010).",Argo
692753,"""Dracula: The Dark Prince"": the title of this made-for-TV film is slightly misleading as it may make you think that the film is about vampires. It is not. Certainly the film stars Rudolf Martin as ""Vlad Dracula the Impaler"" or Prince of Romania (or Wallachia to be precise), one of the models of Count Dracula, but the story itself is not related to Bram Stoker's book or the blood-sucking Count himself. The film claims it is fact-based (and it is though very loosely), inspired by the real history of Vlad Dracula, often referred to as Vlad Tepes (Impaler).Raised by stern father, young Vlad and his brother Radu are later kidnapped and held hostage by the Turkish Sultan. After their father was murdered, only Vlad is allowed to go back to his country (reasons unexplained). Vengeful Vlad vows to free his country and brother Radu from the Turks and he enlists a financial help from Hungarian King Janos (Roger Daltrey). While staying at his court, he falls in love with King's daughter Lidia (Jane March) and marries her.All these incidents loosely based on the historical facts are told as memories of Vlad Dracula interrogated by Father Stefan (Peter Weller) and other priests trying to indict him for his atrocities. The short film includes many events, but as it is clearly low-budget, you cannot expect grand-scale battle scenes. But the film keeps slick storytelling which is not boring with convincing locations (shot in Romania, why not?) and the complex personalities of Vlad Dracula. I only wish that the film took more time to explore the meanings of his extremely harsh punishments as the ruler of the politically unstable country.""Dracula: The Dark Prince"" is not a horror film; it is more like a historical mini-series. It may not be as accurate as it claims, but it surely has a good story in it.",N/A

81251,"In a way, this is the typical, cliched, conventional awe-inspiring movie that the Oscar Academy loves so much. It has most of its elements, indeed, still director Gus Van Sant is able to make it work without falling into some easy traps and melodramatic common-places.Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, apparently a young loser who hasn`t a bright future ahead of him. Yet, as he soon discovers, Will is in fact a bright, highly gifted youngster with an uncommon talent to maths. The plot is rich enough to showcase his growing process and further development, even if occasional predictable scenes unfold.Van Sant suceeds in delivering an enticing and poignant story about self-discovery, isolation, friendship and communication, yet it seems to gets dangerously close to Hollywood fluff in a couple of moments (just close, as it never becomes truly cutesy or embarassing).The acting also helps a little to make the effort work, since besides Damon it includes convincing performances from Robbin Williams, Minnie Driver and Ben and Casey Affleck. The soundtrack is a plus, too, including Danny Elfman and indie talents like Elliot Smith, the Dandy Warhols or Luscious Jackson.&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; is a solid, consistent movie worth watching, yet it is far from being a milestone or a work of genius.

1591502,"Ask just about anyone about ""The Paperboy"" and they'll reply with something along the lines of, ""Isn't that that movie where Nicole Kidman pees on Zac Efron?"" It's funny because that seemed to be the only thing anyone knew about the film going into it. What's peculiar about ""The Paperboy"" is that it's difficult to pinpoint just what type of genre it is. There are comedic elements in there, it's very dramatic at times and really thrilling at others, and the ending is incredibly dark and unexpected. Unfortunately the film doesn't always hit its mark. In fact, it doesn't even hit the target at all at times.Just about every character introduced in the film is sex hungry. Add that to the white trash atmosphere and humor and it's a little overwhelming. Some will find it hysterical, but it's incredibly cheesy more often than not. Whether it's Jack complaining that his dad's maid Anita (Macy Gray) didn't knock before entering his room because he may have been jerking off, Jack and Yardley's obsession with having sex with Charlotte, or Anita's trashy voiceover that guides you through the events of the film that comes off more obnoxious than amusing, the film is constantly jumping all over the place except when it comes to its humor or sexual devotion.Things begin to get really ludicrous once everyone starts visiting the prison to see Hillary. Charlotte claims to get horny in Jack's car because of ""good vibrations"" while their first meeting with Hillary is just absolutely preposterous; Charlotte and Hillary basically orgasm without ever touching each other. It seems like the film wastes so much time with kinky scenes and silly dialogue.Some of the performances are really impressive though. Matthew McConaughey continues the dark streak he started with ""Killer Joe"" here as Ward has this demented side to him that's pretty shocking. He has this scene in his apartment where he's too drunk to function properly and is yelling memories of their mother to Zac Efron from the shower that's both haunting and kind of depressing. David Oyelowo also puts in a strong performance. Yardley's true motives make him an absolutely despicable character and Oyelowo does an impeccable job bringing those characteristics to life. Many of the characters seem to have this different side to them that they hide from the rest of the world; everyone except Hillary Van Wetter. He's not only as messed up as everyone thinks, but even more deranged than anyone can imagine. It's one of the most unusual roles John Cusack has ever portrayed.The way the film is edited is incredibly distracting. Shots are constantly bleeding into others while many scenes begin out of focus and jump around the room before finally settling on the scene at hand. The first few times this is done, it seems like an artistic endeavor. But once you realize that's the way the entire film is edited, it feels amateurish at best and its execution absolutely takes away from whatever the film did have to offer.The screenplay comes off like it's purposely trying to be awful and the film's inability to pick a genre and stick with it seems to hurt it more often than not. At the same time though, the majority of the performances are very strong and everything is certainly unpredictable. The humor is where the film may lose you though. Whether you're a fan of white trash humor that you'd probably find on any episode of ""Jerry Springer"" is what will swerve your opinion one way or the other. ""The Paperboy"" is constantly playing chicken with the line that divides a good movie from a bad one. Just when you've written it off, it reels you back in. Ridiculous through and through and absolutely jaw dropping at times, if ""The Paperboy"" is one thing it's a compelling piece of cinema.",The Paperboy

Kei Fujiwara (of Tetsuo fame) directed this offering, and plays the central role of Yoko, who along with her brother Jun, run a slice-and-dice shop supplying fresh organ meat to the black market. They share a dirty little secret from their younger days (shades of Tetsuo - Bodyhammer, no?), and roam with splitter-splatter vicariousness through downtown Tokyo. Add to it the fact that Jun teaches biology at a girls' school, and has a sealed-off laboratory, and you've got all the makings of human tekka-maki.Every frame of this film portrays humankind at it most abject, gutter level. No one who comes in contact with Yoko or Jun - especially the cops - survives with sanity intact (if indeed they had any to begin with). It's an intense experience, like an amusement park ride, but is it art? Will you watch often?

769669,"Indiana, say it isn't so? Please say that making films like ""Hollywood Homicide"" isn't what has become of Han Solo. Please.It's hard watching screen legends tarnish their legacy. Marlon Brando tried his best to make everyone forget his earlier performances with repeated bombs like ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" and now it seems that Harrison Ford is content on doing the same.Ford is a homicide detective trying to make ends meet as he investigates the gangland style murder of a hip-hop group.Forgive the glossing over the plot. Just trying to follow the film's example.After all, the reason for this film is not the plot, it's to see Ford and co-star Josh Hartnett take their turn at the buddy comedy flick.While shows like CSI making cops look like the smartest, wittiest people on the planet, director Ron Shelton (the force behind ""Bull Durham"" and ""White Men Can't Jump"") decides to play his detectives a little differently.K.C. (Hartnett ""Pearl Harbor"") doubts whether or not he wants to remain an officer or chase his dream of becoming an actor. K.C.'s also a yoga instructor who is only teaching the class for the slew of 20-something year old would-be actresses who attend the class.While his partner has a rotating lineup for his bedmate, Joe Gavilan (Ford) is enjoying his three-week anniversary with Ruby, (Lena Olin from ""Alias"") a radio psychic.The film's walking joke (it starts off as a running joke, but it gets used so much it had to slow its pace to a walk) is that Gavilan is also selling real estate and buyers and sellers keep calling him at the wrong time trying to close deals. It's good for a few chuckles early on, but it becomes too much a crutch joke after a while to remain humorous.In chasing a suspect, our low-rent Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker pursue him around a duck pond. The suspect paddles with his hand on a paddleboat while K.C. runs around the lake telling him to step away from the duck waste. My, how clever.This truly is the film's defining moment. But that definition could read ""Hollywood Homicide"" - n. 1. Seriously unfunny buddy flick 2. Yet another would be Lethal Weapon 3. Last call of Harrison Ford's movie career.With the film's comedy component dying on the respirator, the dramatic aspect doesn't fare any better either. K.C.'s father was killed in the line of duty and there was suspicion that his partner may have had something to do with it.Just so the audience can understand everything, K.C. kindly explains to his partner of four months that the investigation was closed before anything was discovered.Matter-of-factly, Joe offers to call on some favors and learn what happened on the case. That's not the kind of conversation that happens oh, say, on the first month?Dollars to donuts (pun intended) that K.C.'s father's partner is running around involved in the criminal shenanigans. Whatever were the odds?Bruce Greenwood (""Double Jeopardy"") gets a thankless role as an Internal Affairs officer intent on bringing Joe down for humiliating him years ago. It's another needless subplot in a movie so wrapped up with creating new subplots that the whole point of the movie doesn't get addressed until three-fourths of the way.Shockingly (gasp) all of these clich&eacute; puzzle pieces fit exactly into place. As K.C. pieces everything together, there strangely was no ""well duh!"" subtitle at the bottom of the screen.Speaking of thankless roles, Isaiah Washington (""Romeo Must Die"") gets typecast once again as the bad guy and gets to be quite menacing until he gets into a slugfest with Ford.Washington is a talented actor desperately need of better material.Clearly, there's some sort of an attempt to mimic the cop buddy-flick feel of ""Lethal Weapon"" here, but even at the series' most outrageous, there was a modicum of common sense. Imagine if you will, instead of having the younger and more unbalanced Mel Gibson chasing after the bad guy, his older, veteran partner Danny Glover is going after them. Granted, Ford is a much bigger star than Hartnett likely will ever be so it's understandable that he's treated like the big gun. But Ford barely looks like he could run two blocks, let alone maintain a citywide chase without passing out. Age takes its toll on even the Blade Runner.If only this movie would go as fast...",N/A

Finley is memorable as the poor man who has his music stolen, becomes disfigured, unknowingly makes an unholy deal, and rises to save the naive Phoenix from Williams' evil.

The movie is hard to follow somtimes though. It throws too much at you in one movie and it becomes to complexed to follow.

Still though Kate Beckinsale surprisingly is in strong heroine form and it's impressive since she's been in basically only romance movies before this.

There's not really enough action with them verse each other though. Yes they shoot at each other but I'd rather see more of them actually fighting. It's still pretty cool though.

891058,"For those still counting, there are now 8 Hellraiser movies.  The first 4 made box-office appearances, with only the first two achieving a smidgeon of success.  The 4th Hellraiser movie, Kevin Yagher's overlooked ""Bloodline"", did so poorly at the box-office that from that point on subsequent sequels #5 and #6 were relegated to straight-to-DVD status.  As for entries #7(Deader)and #8(Hellworld) they didn't even make it that far, originally.  Apparently Dimension Films thought so little of them that they just sat on their shelves gathering dust for a couple years, un-released in any format whatsoever.  A company shake-up at Dimension now brings us these two new sequels to a franchise that was increasingly running out of ideas which each poor subsequent sequel.  Amazingly, Hellraiser: Deader is actually a pretty good entry and well worth a watch for the undiscriminating horror fan.Amy Klein is an American journalist from NYC who has recently been re-assigned to London to work for the ""London Underground"" paper.  She's an expert of the urban underworlds, who secretly infiltrates and befriends the lost souls of crack houses, whore houses, S&M; parlors and writes revealing exposes on them.  Her new assignment is most interesting: To go to Bucharest, Romania and infiltrate the secret society of the ""Deaders"", a strange cult that encourage suicidal and down-on-their-luck people to kill themselves.  The ""Deaders"" are then able to re-animate them and supposedly give them a new meaning to life.  With the help of some insiders, she gathers clues and eventually ends up opening the secret box, bringing back Pinhead and his Cenobites on this side of the world.  Pinhead and his minions of torture have a score to settle with the ""Deaders"" who are interfering with their universe and poor Amy now finds herself stuck in the middle of a very fierce battle...""Hellraiser: Deader"" is a competently shot sequel that makes good use of sound, music and some oppressively gothic Bucharest locations.  Director Rick Bota throws us head-first into a dirty, sleazy underworld of junkies, crazies, fetish hounds and cult loonies.  I particularly liked the subway car that appears throughout the movie.  Now this is not your average subway car, bear in mind.  It is one where pain and flesh addicts are attached to its walls with chains, as fetish-fiends fornicate to the tune of loud heavy metal music.As for our heroine, Amy is a chain-smoking, self-destructive and cynical girl whose miscues provide a few unintentional chuckles throughout.  For a journalist who is supposedly a seen-it-all veteran of underworld sleaze, she somehow freaks out at the sight of anything in the least bit disturbing.  Her deer caught in the headlights look was wearing thin on me after a while and it's not until right at the end that she finally develops a backbone to her.  Oh well, at least she's hot.As one would expect, leaks in logic abound.  Why would a newspaper company send an American journalist like Amy on an undercover European assignment?  She obviously doesn't fit in, with her noticeable accent.  And how come everyone Amy comes across in Romania speaks perfectly fluent English?  They speak Romanian in Romania don't they?  But heck, minor squabbles these are.  What's a horror b-movie good for when you can't poke a little fun at plot holes?  As for ol' Pinhead and gang their appearances are very limited throughout.  I counted two 30-second appearances by Pinhead (played again by Doug Bradley) on his own and then there's a rather gory 5-minute sequence at the end with him and his cenobites.  I can't help but feel like this franchise has become one where the whole Hellraiser theme is simply a banner and image with the brilliant mythos that Clive Barker created being swept aside.  Still, that doesn't make ""Deader"" a bad film.  For most of the time, I forgot I was even watching a Hellraiser movie, rather I was engrossed with Amy's quest.  Despite its flaws and formulaic nature, ""Hellraiser: Deader"" is a fine addition to the Hellraiser cannon, one that should appease many fans and newcomers alike.",Hellraiser: Deader
327098,"Since its first appearance in 1978, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"" has proven to be a surprisingly durable piece of work; it has survived the transition from radio to print to stage to screen, and will undoubtedly continue to survive in fresh new adaptations for generations to come. Although many reviewers have compared it to ""Star Wars"", I think a more appropriate analogy would be to compare it to ""The Wizard Of Oz"".L. Frank Baum (the Douglas Adams of his day) published ""Oz"" in 1901, and its success inspired him to pen numerous sequels and a series of silent films featuring the characters from the books. Although Baum's films were imaginative for their time, watching one today is a chore that not even an Oz fanatic can do twice. New advances in film technology made the big-budget 1939 version possible, but those same improvements also made Baum's early films unwatchable. In his lifetime, Douglas Adams feared that his 1981 TV adaptation of ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" was doomed to suffer the exact same fate. With the release of the film version in 2005, his prophesy came true.Although the radio and print versions of the series had their limitations, the fans could at least use their imagination to fill in the gaps. When the TV version appeared, the unique creations of the imagination were suddenly erased forever, crudely replaced with cheaply-made props and foam-rubber aliens. Despite the best efforts of BBC-TV's technicians and craftsmen, the TV series resembled a stage play more than a science-fiction movie. The only aspect of the radio series that improved with the transition to TV was the narration, which was cleverly illustrated with animated graphics that were lovingly detailed with hidden jokes for fans.Since first-time viewers are likely to be distracted by the amateurish special effects in the production, the compilers of the ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" DVD package have decided to draw attention to them in hopes of turning a minus into a plus. A bonus disc is stuffed full of documentaries showing the laughable efforts of the BBC technicians (Zaphod's expensively-crafted extra head can't even close his eyelid), and all six episodes feature subtitles that sadistically point out every technical glitch for your pleasure.Technical note: the stereo remix may present some problems for viewers not eqipped with surround sound speakers. Peter Jones' narration is often isolated on one channel, which will cause considerable confusion if you're not using that channel. In addition, Deep Thought's voice is drowned in reverb. The simplest way to make the soundtrack intelligible is to choose the mono mix in the setup menu.The ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" remains one of the wittiest and cleverest series ever produced for radio, and I strongly recommend that you seek out the original BBC Radio productions from 1978-1979. I'm recommending this TV version only to long-time fans of the series. Newcomers are advised to see the movie - but only after you've read the books.",N/A
810859,"I guess my expectations for this DVD were set way too high.I saw this band perform live back in the 1970's and was very impressed with their live sound and rock solid performances.  Now over 20 years later...they are a little tired I suppose and not giving it their best.  The vocals on ""Long Train Running"" and the music/sound mix on ""South City Midnight Lady"" were not 5 stars worthy.  Micheal McDonald's ""three song set"" was way too short...they could have had him sing at least five songs....after all,he wrote and produced some of their best material.I also don't enjoy concert footage that keeps being interrupted by interviews with band members, between each of the songs!  Isn't that was the ""extra's"" and ""special features"" sections are for on most artist's DVD's?The more I think about this particular show...I will rate it only ""3"" stars!!! (I had originally given it 4!)It could have been much better...and frankly, it should have been much better performed, recorded and produced.  This band has way too many excellent hit songs and years of live performance experience, for them to put this ""mediocre of a product"" out!",The Doobie Brothers - Rockin Down the Highway: The Wildlife Concert
648924,"Happy Feet is set in Antartica in society of penguins who attract mates through song. However, Happy FEET is the story of a penguin who can't sing very well and instead dances (hence the title of the movie).However, the young penguin, Mumble, is laughed at and ostracized by his fellow penguins for not only his horrible singing, but his dancing too. However, after running into a groupe of ""hispanic"" penguins, a series of incidents occur and an adventure of epic proportions begins . . .Now personally, I did NOT like Happy Feet. Maybe it was the singing in dancing? Maybe it was the cliche message? I don't know. However, no longer being a kid, I'm trying to take a more objective look at Happy Feet. I'm going to start with why I liked the movie and then why I didn't like the mnvie.Reasons I liked (to a certain extent) Happy Feet:1) Robin Williams was hilarious as Lovelace and the little munchkin penguins . . . Though some maybe be insulted by little stereotypical (to a certain extent) penguins (though I doubt the kids would be offended so it's more the adults to look out for . .  .I suppose)2) The environmentalist message .  . . Kids gotta learn that their actions (littering being one of them) has impacts (sometimes devestating)on the environment and those living in the environment (such as the penguins)Reasons I didn't like Happy Feet . . .:1)The singing . . . I don't recall if there was a single orginal song in this movie . .  . .I don't know . . Maybe Warner Bros. movies just don't do original songs . . . .2) The other, more misguided message . . .Yes . .we should all learn to appreciate those who are different, but I don't think we should wait until he or she saves our lives first . . .After a person (or penguin in this case) saves a life, then one might say the person is now a hero/heroine rather than someone ""different"" who simply should be respected and appreciated for who they are rather then what they become (which in the case of this movie would be a ""hero"") . . .but maybe I'm just overthinking this . ..",N/A

484590,"Okay, so the Epcot-esque finale is more fromage than homage, and is remniscent of the touchy-feely, ending of THE ABYSS.  But there' enough hard-SciFi realism to rivet the attention spans of most physicists.Leave no doubt in your mind, the worst Brian De Palma flick is leagues better than the best Michael Bey(Armageddon) opus.  If you thought that Armageddon was good SciFi, then I'm surprised you're reading this.  As a matter of fact...I would be suprised that you would know how to read, at all?!The plot, what little of it there is, concerns Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise who play astronauts on the 2nd Martian mission.  It would seem that Don Cheadle is the only surviving member of the first mission, whose purpose was, apparently, to build a bridge between the two peaks (wink wink to Monty Python) of Mount Olympus...or some such foolishness.But the plot, as in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, is secondary to the breathtaking visuals of the dangerous crossing from Earth-to-Martian-space the crew endures.  Without giving too much away, there's a frightening depressurization when the ship strikes micrometeorites just prior to Mars orbital insertion, and the ensuing action is gripping enough to hold fans jaded by most &quot;junk science&quot; space movie fare.",Mission to Mars
852831,"Not having seen anything but ""Gozu"" in what I've read is an illustrious catalogue by filmmaker Takasha Miike, I can't judge him solely on the strengths and weaknesses of this film in particular.  It was a wild, riveting ride, with some unforgettable scenes (particularly the opening, in which a slowly deteriorating member of the Yakuza crime family murders a puppy in the belief that it is a ""Yakuza attack dog"", and of course the queasy ""rebirth"" scene of that very same gangster at the film's conclusion), and at times reminds one of a Beckett play (the man with the pigment problem reclining in the field with a magazine, the innkeeper whipping her husband to generate ""spirits"", etc) a Lynch film (characters changing identities, gender bending, scenes of the most cartoonish sexual debauchery), and Monty Python all at once.  The problem, though, is that none of this means anything.  Unlike Lynch or Beckett we can find no discernible meaning, not even with the most circumspect viewing, simply because there is none.While I love surrealism, a movie does need to be more than the sum of it's parts, and ""Gozu"", for all it's nail biting scenes and undeniably menacing atmosphere, is only that.  A member of the Yakuza family named Ozaki is killed as he is about to commit a random of madness by Minami, a friend indebted to him forever for saving his life.From here everything goes wacky, and not in an unpleasant manner entirely: his corpse disappears from Minami's car.  There are strong elements of Hitchcock here, too, but from this point in the film nothing really makes any sense, even in retrospect.  We see a host of bizarre and stomach churning things: an inkeeper who likes to squirt her own milk rather than buy it from the store, handicapped Japanese people screaming about whether the day was hot or not.  Meanwhile our protagonist is taken on a journey that is imaginative and surreal but, in the end, all smoke.In the film essay Miike cites the influence, which is obvious anyway, of David Lynch films like ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive"".  There are definitely similarities.  In those movies, though, as strange and dreamlike as they are, there is an ultimate explanation, or host of explanations, for why things have happened this way.  Not all Lynch films have an ""ultimate point"", but those two did, and ""Gozu"" most certainly does not.  This is more than enjoyable, don't get me wrong; in fact, for people of certain tastes, including my own, I'd recommend it.  But don't expect a puzzle or anything to think extensively about.",Gozu

767547,"Mystery of the Batwoman has made quite a bad reputation for itself since its release a decade ago. I'm not really sure why, or if it deserves the fanboy hate, but one thing is for sure - it killed the Bruce Timm/Alan Burnett Batman continuity that began with the TV series back in 1992. Kevin Conroy has returned as Batman in a few video games but there has been no proper Batman animated movie since this one (unless you count Public Enemies, where he shares half of the screen time with Superman).The Penguin is in the midst of setting up an arms deal with Carton Duquesne, Rupert Thorne, and Bane when the sudden appearance of a new crime-fighter in the shape of Batwoman causes them all sorts of grief. Not taking kindly to his image being tainted by an unaffiliated vigilante Batman sets out to discover who she really is.It's a decent plot, but never feels moody or atmospheric. The gothic pathos of the animated Batman entries that fans are familiar with is strangely absent/muted. However there are some good action scenes and a nice twist half-way through that might seem a little redundant on repeat viewings. The animosity it has gathered since 2003 is a little hard to justify, it's still better than Sub-Zero.The Blu-ray is a marginal disappointment. It IS a great improvement over the DVD, featuring the movie in the correct 1.78:1 aspect ratio instead of 1.33:1. The picture balance looks much better and the colors frequently pop, but there is a very strange blurriness to a number shots which feature fuzzy, jagged black outlines. It is very odd, like they zoomed-in on the original print and lost resolution as a result. It might be a fault of the animation and not the Blu-ray transfer, though if you are annoyed by such things it will lessen the overall quality of the Blu-ray for you. The 1080p transfer would otherwise be impressive if it were not marred by this unusual anomaly. The DTS HD-MA audio fares much better and sounds great. The extras have been simply ported from the old DVD and dumped with no re-mastering. Even the ads, trailers, and 'Chase Me' short are in nasty standard definition.Warner could have improved the presentation a bit, and with this exception of the aforementioned picture deficiencies it is a good upgrade on the DVD.",N/A
1235611,"There are some folks here who have said that although this series is different from the original, it is still the same quality of story and almost as good as the original. I am going to disagree. The animation is very different, the girls are very different, but most importantly the story line is not as good. This is not the original, it is not as good as the original, and I can't think of a single thing that was improved in this version.The girls have been ""glamorized"" for this series. Big eyes, cute hair, etc. Henrietta looks nothing like her character from the original series. The moment that I noticed this, I knew there was only one reason to make this change - the story is not as good as the original and they need to prop up the series by making the girls more attractive.The animation is not of the same quality as the original. Many shortcut methods were used to reduce cost and stretch frames. This I could forgive if the story made up for it. Alas, it does not.That said, the most important aspect of the original series was the storyline and the time spent developing the girls' characters. This critical element of the original series' success is sorely lacking in this series. The entire time I watched this series, I kept asking ""where are the girls?!"" This series spends too much time on characters I do not care about and that contribute nothing to enhance the story. Where is the action? I want more action WITH the girls. What I remember most about watching this series is constantly wondering when the girls were coming back and why are they giving me a soap opera with characters I don't care about. When they did finally get around to the formula that worked in the original series, it was always too little and I would be disappointed when they went back to the soap opera.If you loved the original series as much as I did, you are going to be seriously disappointed with this one. If you must have it to complete your collection, or as in my case, having a serious need for more GSG, then by all means go ahead.

This has decent CGI, but not quite as as polished as some of the other dinosaur stuff I've seen.  The story is nice, but a little short and doesn't cover a lot of prehistoric animals.

21148,"Okay,having read both the original JM Barrie AND the Terry Brooks adaptation of Hook, I would agree that the movie falls short of its mark.Julia Roberts is hard to buy as Tink, Robin Williams and Dustin  Hoffman pull off their respective roles quite well. Maggie Smith is awsome  (and look who plays the young Wendy). Cameos abound to make the viewing  fun, and the performers do well. The visual effects are awsome, flying is  so well done you wonder how he does it, and the first view of NeverLand  demands that you have a Widescreen version of this film... if you choose to  buy it.The plot, briefly, is about an adult Peter living in contemporary  society (just ignore the fact that he would be about 100 years old at this  point... IT'S A FANTASY!). He is a corporate lawyer who is fast losing  touch with his family and himself. A trip to London to see family  brings  back old enemies. Peter must go to NeverLand, fight Hook, and get his  children back. The pirates are suitably grungy and aged, but the Lost Boys  are the biggest letdown. Rather than the collection of late 19th and  turn-of-the-century children you would expect, you get a bunch of  streetwise urchins from any time period up to present day. And, hey, they  don't fly! The movie boils down to the final Pan vs Hook  confrontation.Those claiming the movie is over-violent should look more  carefully. Only ONE person dies. All of the Lost Boys' weapons are the most  non-violent weapons seen. With all the sword-play, no one is even  scratched. It might have been better had there been more loss for the  audience to care about. The movie seems to dwell too long on some parts,  not long enough in others. You watch the movie to get to the moments of  revelation; Peter finding out who he is, seeing NeverLand for the first  time, Peter finding his Happy Thought and what that thought is, him finally  becoming Pan again...The John Williams score is, per usual, top-notch.  The music adds emotional impact at moments when needed, heightening the  mood in others. All of his music is a great ride.If you liked the movie  enough to want to buy it at all, get a clean copy that allows you to see  EVERYTHING. I myself have the Deluxe Widescreen edition of the LaserDisc,  so can only recommend getting the DVD. The best advantage would be the  ability to skip over the parts that annoy you to the punch of the story.",N/A

After doing research--I discovered it was all scripted. The ""estranged"" son was the film maker! So it is nonsense when they see him at the end and are 'surprised', as he was ALWAYS around! That means the whole cross-country journey was also fiction (and completely unnecessary).  Online, the son claims the ""SCRIPT"" was created well before this all came to fruition.SO...it IS a good film, if you didn't know better--if you thought it was a real documentary. I was originally fascinated by it. But that was when I believed it to be real. Now that I know the truth...it has all the intrigue of that stupid 'Blair Witch Project'.  Why would I want to see it a second time? Why would I want to own it? It is ""fiction in disguise.""So I say forget this thing and get 'Grey Gardens.'  It is real, it is dear, and you will never forget it. I knew 'Little Edie' and you can be sure the film is the real deal.I give this film three stars because it DID convince me, before I found out the truth. And this means it must be pretty well done.

799205,"The Matrix: Revolutions picks up right where The Matrix: Reloaded left off, so everyone is trying to figure out what happened to Neo (Keanu Reeves) and how to save him.  But when Neo finally gets out of the Matrix, he comes back changed and he has discovered some disturbing information that will force him to make some difficult decisions.  Neo finds that he can't even confide in Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and that, although he is still The One, he doesn't quite believe that he can make a difference anymore.  After spending a lot of time alone, Neo comes to the conclusion that he must go up to the surface and fight the machines on the old battleground, not just through the matrix.  His other teammates try and dissuade him, but with Trinity by his side, Neo heads for the surface.  Little does he know that Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has a few surprises in store for him along the way...Meanwhile, the rest of the crew heads back to Zion, all too aware that the fate of humankind may rest on their shoulders.  For while they are trying to avoid the machines on their way home, the machines are attacking Zion and are programmed to destroy every living thing that remains.  The inhabitants of Zion are not about to let their city go without a fight, however, and they use all of their old machinery and ammunition to try and keep the machines at bay.  The Council will do just about anything to buy Neo more time, because in these last desperate hours all they have is hope...I thought that this movie was wonderful in some ways and a disappointment in others.  First off, I have to admit that I hated the ending.  I can't quite figure out if the directors were trying to leave the Matrix open for future sequels or if they just wanted to stay all mystical and let people draw their own conclusions.  I disagree with others, however, in that they say that the directors never answered any of their questions - the directors never made any plans to answer questions and from the outset it was obvious that the Matrix was always going to be a kind of shadowland that kept its own secrets.  Most of the special effects were still amazing, but I expected this and almost expected them to be even better because this was the third and final movie in the trilogy and it should have just knocked my socks off.  If anyone else had done the special effects, I probably would have been a lot more impressed, but the directors raised the bar so high with the first film that they were their own worst enemies.  I was also a bit disappointed that they relied so heavily on CGI instead of on stunt work because that was what made all of the fight scenes so cool.  This movie was also quite a bit drabber than the others because there was hardly any time spent in the Matrix and I have to admit that I missed all of the sweet outfits they used to wear there.  On the positive side, there were some great scenes in Zion as individuals fought hard to withstand the machines and one of my favorite characters was the Kid (Clayton Watson) who worshipped Neo and turned out to be a hero.  There were some touching moments between Link and his wife and Hugo Weaving, playing Agent Smith, was a great villain.  The sets were still incredibly imaginative and there were some fun one-liners as well, so there are some good parts to the movie.  All in all, I must admit that I enjoyed myself in the theatre and felt that it was money well spent, but it wasn't the spectacular finish that I had envisioned...",N/A
1081872,"This Universal two pack,on two single discs,features Dawn of the Dead(released Mar/04)and Land of the Dead(released June/05),both in their director cuts.It doesn't mean they are any better,just a little longer.Both films were shot in and around Toronto,with the first having a majority of its cast from Canada.The second uses mostly Canadian supporting players while the films leads are mostly Americans.Dawn of the Dead finds Sarah Polley as the lead character,playing a nurse who comes home from a hard day at the hospital.The next morning the world has turned upside down as many of the populace have become walking zombies and she must flee for her life.She ends up in an accident in transit but meets up with policeman Ving Rhames.Together they follow some other folks to the local mall.They are only safe for a little while on the main floor and eventually are forced to make their way up to the second level.There some security guards have already taken control,and it takes some time for them to acquiesce to let them in.Once in they go about making their surroundings more secure and even allow the entry of a truck load of survivors from the outside.Eventually they formulate a plan to cross the city to a marina and commandeer one of the occupants boats to sail to an island offshore.Things do not go smoothly(do they ever?)as they have to stalk up on ammunition,which sits in a gun shop across from the mall.The owner of the shop has been on the roof and in contact with them since almost the beginning.He however has gotten very hungry.To alleviate his discomfort they send a dog with food in packs over to the store.The owner lets the dog in through a small opening but neglects to secure it.The zombies follow in and take care of him.One of the survivors takes a truck and goes over to rescue her dog but gets trapped herself.It is now up to the group to rescue her,which they do.They stock up on their ammo and leave in two large mall buses,maxed out with heavy reinforced siding and other steel product.Alot of ups and downs for the group later,they finally arrive at the marina and leave on the boat.The end credits show us that their journey and arrival to the island is not as idyllic a happy ending as any of them would have wanted.This film has quite the plot gaps throughout and one must assume and/or accept certain situations in situ,sometimes too much.For instance,among the group there is a couple,and the woman is pregnant.Most the way through she is fine but suddenly somewhere along the line she has been turned into a zombie;with no explanation as to the how and why of her turning,as no zombies ever reached the 2nd level.In another scene,one of the buses transporting part of the group to the marina,overturns.During that time one of the passengers is brandishing a chain saw which is on.As the bus flips we see him cutting into a woman,and presumably killing her.When we next see him he is dead also.Did the saw kill him too or was it just the bus flip? However it happened,it seemed like a very contrived way of disposing of two characters.On top of all this,one must explain how in the world the group trapped in the mall managed to come up with all of the equipment and armour they attached to those mall buses.AND with razor wire to boot!!? What mall sells that kind of hardware and razor wire? The plot is,speaking of wire,razor thin.The film just never seems to find its Zen and pull us into its realm to any great length.However it was nice to see Canadian actors Matt Frewer and Jayne Eastwood,a pair I hadn't seen for quite some time.Only 2 1/2 to maybe three stars,at best.Land of the Dead has at the helm the zombie meister himself,legendary George Romero.This plot finds a city at siege with zombies(surprise).One Mr Kaufmann,played by Dennis Hopper,lives in a city high rise and has surrounded a certain area outside the tower with fencing/barricades to keep the zombies at bay and out.Only the elite,ie.those with power and money,get to reside IN the tower,called Fiddlers Green.The rest of the rabble live outside the tower and inside the barricades.One Riley Denbo,played by Simon Baker,works for Kaufmann and heads up a special group that drives the heavily armoured Dead Reckoning,which keeps the surviving citizenry safe,fed and with medical supplies as needed.However the zombies in this film have gotten smart and one in particular,a gas attendant,teaches and leads the hordes to not only fight back,but leads an armed rebellion and siege on the city and the tower.In the meantime Denbo's second in command,Cholo,played by John Leguizamo,has decided its time to retire and asks Kaufmann not only for his back pay but a suite in the tower.When Kaufmann rejects his requests Cholo highjacks the Dead Reckoing and intends to level the tower if he isn't paid his money.Kaufmann directs Denbo to recover the vehicle,but the zombies by this time have reached the city limits and are storming the tower.By the time Denbo finally gets the truck in hand the zombies have entered the tower and are in the process of getting to and killing Kaufmann.Denbo rushes back and while it is too late for his old boss,he has saved the lives of a good many friends and assorted citizenry.The zombies,job done,leave the city to the living.Denbo and the surviving group head north to Canada.This film,along with having the Romero""touch"" has alot better actors/acting going for it than the other film in this set along with a more compelling plot.The plot here is given a nice twist with the zombies getting ""educated"".There are also a few funny/campy moments,such as a shot of three lone zombie musicians in a gazebo,still holding their instruments,and in fact one still blowing his tuba!Another where patrons get to take pictures with two tied up zombies.And watch closely at those two zombies,as they are none other than Simon Pegg and his Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright!! It seems George Romero so liked Pegg's movie he invited them both over to Toronto to have a cameo role in his!With Romero at the helm this movie couldn't miss and though not perfect,I rate it around the 3 1/2-4 star mark.Technically speaking both films are in a w/s a/r of 2:35:1,and both are clear and crisp.The list of extras on each disc is too long to even begin to list.Both contain featurettes on their making,special effects,deleted scenes,director commentaries,etc,etc.In other words enough to please the most discriminating of fans.In conclusion while Dawn of the Dead I found a bit slow and which never hit its mark,and saddled with a dodgy plot,I found Land of the Dead to be much better and more highly engaging and with a better cast of actors.The price is a good one for both.Recommended.... but just.",N/A

El Videoclip que hay como Extra de la Presentacion del Teatro Blanquita tampoco tiene la cancion original, tiene el mismo sonido midi. Realmente para lo que es la Telenovela, esta edicion me desepciono, anulan todas las escenas de la carrera de ella como cantante y se centra mas en el dramatismo de la historia que en esa esencia que forma parte de la tira. No me mato la edicion, esperaba otra cosa, realmente la compre porque soy Fan de Thalia, y para la coleccion, pero me hubiese gustado que fuera diferente, que al menos le hubiesen dejado la cancion original porque ni siquiera tiene la musica incidental de cuando se transmitio. Por otra parte note un detalle muy importante, y es que sacaron las escenas donde muere Rene Mu&ntilde;oz, el Abuelo Florentino despues de enfrentarse con Valeria en su casa, si bien se ve la escena donde Valeria lo envenena no se se ve cuando muere ni cuando le avisan a Rosalinda, ni el velorio ni nada de eso, que por cierto no hace falta ser muy inteligente para darse cuenta que despues de esa escena entre Valeria y el no aparece mas en todo lo que resta de la Telenovela, se olvidaron ese detalle, que me parece de muy mal gusto. Lo ideal seria que si la volvieran a Editar lanzaran el Dvd al menos con una cancion de Thalia y no con el Midi que contiene esta edicion ya que la musica es espantoza y si la quitaron por derechos de copyright al menos hubieran elegido cualquier tema de Thalia, hubiera sido mejor, como tambien seria bueno que dejaran las presentaciones donde Rosalinda canta, como Paloma Dorantes y como Rosalinda, ya que no pusieron ninguna, al menos que las pasaran como secuencias con otra musica, como hicieron con el Videoclip que esta como extra.",N/A
179158,"Mitchum plays a great menacing guy and Peck is not bad as the lawyer trying to save his family.  The film's weaknesses are it's points of unbeleiveability, of which there are more than a few. Many things in the course of events are just too convenient and one just has to accept them rather than see how the characters actually acheived them - like when Cody follows Kojak's motorboat in a rowboat. Right. Or when Cody (Mitchum) drowns the police guard who barely puts up a fight, doesn't make a sound, and casually lets himself die - kind of insults the intelligence. But then if our hero had heard the scuffle the movie would've been over a lot quicker.  I could go into other things, but would give a lot of the film away.  Also some of the shots which are supposed to explain transition from one event to the next are too short almost leaving you to wonder what just happened.I wanted to like this film better than I did, and I watched it because I usually like black and white films from the early 60s.  What this does have in common with many films from that time is atmosphere. How much of that is due to it's being in black and white is open to debate.  Just as a color photo and a black and white photo of the same shot will give off a different charge, so too with the movies.  It may be partially for this reason that early 60s movies are so atmospheric though I'm not convinced that's the full reason.  There is also the sense of new things being tried, new ground being broken, etc. That's another reason I wanted to see this - to compare it with the remake.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars just because its old and its actors are famous. Even 4 seems high, while 3 seems low.  So 3.5 it is. Getting back to atmosphere - in spite of it's flaws the movie does succeed in wratcheting up the tension, although the low-beleivability factor and the somewhat melodramatic music periodically deflate that tension. For those who don't like to be scared, you can be thankful for small favors.",N/A

778626,"I just wanted to comment briefly on the video quality of this set. I just bought a new HDTV and was looking forward to watching this series filling that nice large screen in a proper 16:9 aspect ratio. As everyone probably knows, all the DVDs in this series suffer from some quality issues due to the way the CGI shots were originally done. This was noticeable in previous season releases as well as this one. So I was prepared for this when I popped the first disc in. But I wasn't prepared for the extreme amounts of grain in the video. When watching this on my old 32"" Trinitron TV, the video looked fine. But on my new 46"" HDTV, it looks really, really awful. All the flaws are laid bare on a large HDTV screen. At first, I thought it was an issue with my TV. But all my other DVDs look fantastic. So I tweaked the settings as much as I could, but it didn't really help much. Then for comparison purposes, I popped in a disc from Season 1. There is some noticeable grain there, too, but it's still quite watchable and it even gives it a nice film-like quality which is kind of pleasing. I also tried the movie ""A Call to Arms"" from the Babylon 5 movie collection set. It looks pretty good, too. But on the Season 4 set, and on ""Thirdspace"" from the movie set, the grain is seriously distracting and looks just plain bad. It has unfortunately ruined my enjoyment of this very good season. From what I've read, this seems to be a problem with the source and not with the DVD transfers themselves, so I don't know if this will ever be correctable. And like I said, it looks fine on a regular TV. But I just wanted to give a warning to anyone who plans to watch this on an HDTV someday. Prepare to be disappointed.",Babylon 5: Season 4

949400,"I had actually owned this movie for awhile, but had not gotten around to watching it until we went to see STARDUST...based on another Neil Gaiman story.  We enjoyed that very much, so I dug out the DVD and my wife and 14 year old daughter and I plunked down for an enjoyable evening.104 minutes later, my wife was asleep and my daughter barely awake.  I was still watching, but felt guilty for having wasted so much time.The movie is STUNNING to look at...no question about that.  It basically captures a feeling of a dream better than almost any movie in recent memory.  A young teenage girl, feeling worried and guilty about her mother's serious illness, falls into a dream inspired by her owned crazy drawings and driven by a growing need to rescue a ""white"" queen and vanquish (sorta) a ""dark"" queen.  Both queens are played by the actress who plays the mother, so we immediately assume that story is how the girl will work out the conflict between herself, her mother and even her mother's illness.The movie is fantastic to look at.  It is highly creepy, and made us all question the PG rating...we thought PG-13 would have been more appropriate.  The dreamland is populated by an assortment of disturbing creatures.  Each new scene brought a new visual splendor.  The film does not lack imagination.  It's like watching visual art come to life.  For awhile, we were enthralled.But then it become quite obvious that the film had nothing of real interest to tell us through these visuals.  The idea of a young girl working out serious problems in her life through dreams or dream-like incidents was just played out a  million times better in PAN'S LABRYNTH (although, to be fair, MIRRORMASK is even more visually creative).  The plot was quite skimpy and the journey of the young lady became repetitive and more and more uninvolving.  It was simply hard to want to watch through to the end.  I glanced at my watch every two or three minutes...thinking surely 15 minutes have gone by.Over the history of filmmaking, many visually stunning films have been made that stretched the boundaries of technical and visual possibilities.  2001: A SPACE ODDESSEY.  NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  And like those films, MIRROR MASK failed to enchant on a basic story-telling basis.Before I forget, let me first praise Stephanie Leonidas, who plays the teenage hero of the film.  She is terrific and I would have liked to see more of her performance and perhaps less upstaging by the visuals.The movie is an interesting failure.  In most cases, a film that bored me so thoroughly would get no more than 2 stars, possibly just 1...but MIRROR MASK has too much creativity to simply get slapped down.

Fantastic special effects aside, the story feels incomplete, the pacing is odd, the sense of urgency slips from time to time with unnecessary distractions, the dialog was everything except informative, and the acting uniformly dull (Sam Neil in particular looked as if he wanted to be somewhere else doing anything but this movie.).  The only element that worked was the spooky shape shifters living next door.  If the rest of the movie had managed to capitalize on that instead of splintering off into a lackluster teen angst movie of the week this might have worked.  Instead, with too many things that didn't make sense, this movie just drifted from one inexplicable scene to another: the `split' of the twins was arbitrary and forced, the sequence in the police station useless, why did the aunt and uncle keep disappearing?  In addition, some of the reactions to danger were obscenely ludicrous (who, upon hearing their neighbors want to kill them, just go to bed.  Or, while your front door is being broken down, just stand there and watch until the intruder is upon you!?).  Crazy.

Because it's only based on one section of the New Testament, it does feel like watching a film adaptation of the end of a book.  I am well-versed in the Bible, so this wasn't a problem for me, but I feel it was a bit exclusionary to not include some backstory (even though the title clearly reveals that it's a cinematic passion play).Mel Gibson's directing and Caleb Deschanel's cinematography bring the film to vivid life.  This is the second time in a year that I've praised Deschanel's camera work in a film.  The man is becoming a force to be reckoned with.The film is far from perfect, but it's worth a viewing.

1336668,"(actually I'd give it two and a half stars, but the template won't let me go halfway on a star... but since I *really wanted to like* this movie more than the final verdict left me, figured I er on the side of nice.)So, the movie version of one of the best werewolf novels ever... wound up as a direct-to-redbox cheapy. Nowhere near as bad as feared; in fact, there's a lot going for this, particularly in atmosphere and inspired character-actor casting - I think I'm in love with Eva Amurri and Nickie Aycox [hot werewolf girls... literally at each other's throats... *growl*], Marc Blucas is perfectly cast and deserves to go far as an actor, and villain Naveen Andrews is a pure wicked treat. But I swear, someone in the freakin' editing room must have been on a Mission to make this movie suck! And the story/mythos-changes did nothing but clutter things worse. Also, they made that most frequent of gambles when adapting material like this from page to screen, namely taking story elements that were withheld 'til later in the book, creating tension and mystery that built to surprise twists, and presenting it in real-time from the git-go (as in pretty much every screen/stage version of DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE). Sometimes said switch-around works out well, in other cases not. Here... not so much :-/ And seriously, when adapting a 500-page novel with a rather packed plot, there's no excuse for so much filler in the first half of an 80-minute movie, then truncating the second half of the story within an inch of its life. All that internal POV/voice-over/werewolf-DNA-microscope-footage nonsense was a nightmare (and not in the good way you'd hope for from this sort of movie). Still, I confess, I actually like how they made use of low-rent CGI for their creature effects. If you can't make your otherworldly creature look convincingly physically *there*, why not go the other way and have it look intentionally *not* quite there, semi-spectral, suggesting your beastie's not fully of this dimension of existence.

A Dr. Mortimer asks Holmes to protect the life of Sir Henry Baskerville, his best friend's nephew.  It is revealed that Mortimer's friend, Sir Charles Baskerville, recently died and although it was ruled a natural death, Dr. Mortimer knew he was being chased by the legendary Hound of the Baskervilles.  This hound has plagued the Baskerville family for years.While Holmes attends to other matters in London, his partner,  Watson (Nigel Bruce),  is sent to stay with Sir Henry and keep an account of routine as well as puzzling happenings at the ancestral estate and hall.  He is dedicated to protecting Sir Henry and notes the puzzling actions of servants in the hall.  Odd happening before included a single boot stolen at Sr. Henry's hotel room before arriving at his ancestral home.Sir Henry is an eligible, handsome bachelor and soon meets the beautiful Beryl Stapleton and her brother John.  Sir Henry and Beryl soon start keeping company and become engaged.  The puzzling plot thickens as Holmes reveals he has been masquerading as a bum who lives in the moors.

630458,"""Friday Night Lights"" is a great movie. Not in terms of what happens, or how it happens, but in terms of acting and story line. The movie starts off promisingly enough, and it starts to live up to expectations. Not soon after that, though, the movie starts to drag in parts. Normally this is not problem. All movies do this. From great movies like ""Garden State"" (in the scene where they bury the hamster) and terrible movies like ""I, Robot"" (the entire first half). But with this movie it doesn't just drag for a minute or two. It drags...and drags...and drags for about ten minutes. There are aspects of the movie that are left unexplained, like that one kid's mother. All throughout the movie, people keep going up to him and asking ""How's yer mom doing?"" and he either says fine or she'll be dying soon. For a while in the second half, we are led to believe she has terrets syndrome when she starts shouting and cursing at her TV screen. But that wouldn't cause her to be sick, is the thing. We all have some form of terrets. When we get mad...when Carl's Jr. puts out more of those ""dumb guy"" commercials, or when they outlaw those Paris Hilton ones. There are other parts of the movie that are nauseating, in all senses. This could be a perfectly good adult sports drama, but, alas, the movie had to appeal to teenagers by adding constant references to ""getting laid"" and doing drugs. Another thing that made me want to vomit was the camera work. It's not that it wasn't good, it was great, it was just a little too pretensious. The handheld camera technique worked in ""Snatch"", but not here. The picture comes off herky jerky and a little ugly. But, there are many more great aspects about the movie than there are bad. The acting is great, and some of the football scenes are truly intense, especially the last one, even though we all know what will happen. The end is one thing that brings this movie down from five star level. As we all think the team will win and we get ourselves geared up for it, they end up losing. I guess it is my fault because I didn't know the end already, but it was still a major let down. Director Peter Berg is much better at staging the more subdued scenes, such as two character talking. He falters, however, in scenes of cringe inducing sports violence that just make the movie a little better, yet a little harder to watch. Berg does stage one hilarious scene in a parking lot of the local drug store involving star Billy Bob Thorton, his wife and his daughter. This is not a suprise, since Berg's past credits include ""The Rundown"", and action-comedy, and ""Very Bad Things"", a very dark comedy. ""Friday Night Lights"" is an interesting drama, but there are a few too many scenes that try to be serious but instead are funny. Names of characters, like my good friend Boobie Miles, will cause laughs between pre-teens 10-12, probably. This is not a great movie, or at times even a good one, but it gets the job done in an entertaining, efficient way. It will appeal mostly to sports jocks, and maybe to their unfortunate girlfriends, wives, or significant others that they drag to this movie. I usually like any kind of movie, and I also assumed that I would like this one. I saw the first ""Bridget Jones"" the same day as I saw ""Collateral"" and loved them both. I thought that I may as well give this a try, even if the previews didn't make it look to great. While this movie is better than something like ""Hoosiers"", it's not as good as, say, ""Million Dollar Baby"". The ending of this one will leave you in the same, dark place that ""M$B"" left you, and it isn't sugar coated and cutsey like ""Hoosiers"" was. At times, ""Friday Night Lights"" takes itself a little too seriously. Scenes where the team practices feel like comic relief from the serious and stressfull other points of the movie. When a character cries, the acting in that scene is so overdone that one can't help but laugh.Thortan plays coach Gary Gaines, who has recently moved to Odessa, Texas to escape his losing streak. He starts the season anew, and he is hopeful with his many new players. Some, like Boobie (Derek Luke), are overly pompus. Others, like Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), are abuses at home. Don is abused by his father, Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw), who used to play for the same team as Don is now playing on. Charles wants Don to be what he could never be: great. Don resents him for that, and as a result, Charles gets drunk and yells at and hits him alot. Gaines teaches the kids how to respect their fellow teammates, and the movie follows that same old cliche ridden script. The team plays through the semi-finals, the finals, and finally makes it to the championship. This happens over a two hour five minute time span, and at times the movie feels overlong. It feels about 20 minutes too long. Usually, sports movies use their time wisely, there fore they are never that long. This particular film wastes some time (45 minutes or so) detailing how the players live, yet oddly, the characters are incredibly underdeveloped.The movie takes a true story and spins it into a slightly fictional tale, one that makes it not more interesting, but more eccentric, in a strange way. The characters are never fully developed, and as the movie progresses we keep thinking that they will be developed more, or at least in fuller detail. Unfortunately, that never happens, and we are left on our own to figure something out about these characters. Not every single one is not developed. Gaines, Boobie, Charles, Don, and Gaines' wife are all fully developed. That will have to do, though, since nothing else in the movie, or anyone else for that matter, is explained that well. This movie is a dissapointment because it could have been so much more. So much more dramtic, so much more funny, so much more game oriented. Oh. Sorry. The movie is game oriented, and fatally so. The film, after a while, begins to feel like a bunch of different games and practices strung together with placement titles on the bottom of the screen. It probably feels like this because the movie really is just a bunch of games and practices after a while. ""Friday Night Lights"" shows just how obsessed this town is with its games, and it does it well with montages of stores with signs that read ""Gone To The Game"", and how it shows the packed stadiums is truly breathtaking. ""Friday Night Lights"" is well done in so many ways. Too many to mention. But it is also fatally flawed in just as many ways. Sad, in a way, since this movie had real potential. Real, genuine, special potential that it squanders mostly in its last half hour. Sorry Billy Bob, you were better in ""Bad Santa"".",Friday Night Lights

He got the interiors of the female lead's house for just a promise to the owner that it would appear in a Hollywood film! Why this cat didn't end up working for Roger Corman is a mystery. How many film students ever make a picture, let alone manage to sell it and get it screened from coast to coast? The fact that TFOS has a cult audience nearly 50 years later is a testament to the fact that there's something more at work here than an average B-flick.

704061,"I've searched a very long time to see this movie. I've noticed that all of Luchino Visconti's films are extremely hard to obtain. Now that I have finally seen this movie I have seen everything that is available on vhs or dvd by the great Visconti.&quot;La Terra Trema&quot; reminds me heavily of a film Visconti would make later entitled &quot;Rocco &amp; His Brothers&quot;. Both films deal with poor Sicilan families trying to make a living. Each family facing the injustice of the upper class vs the lower class. But between the two I must admit I prefer &quot;Rocco..ect&quot;. Because it seems to be more about plot. &quot;Rocco&quot; has more of a story to tell. And it's three lead characters make the the movie. &quot;La Terra Trema&quot; is a little short on plot. And the film goes on way too long. The movie is over 2 hours.&quot;La Terra Trema&quot; is about the local fishing community. About the hardships the fisherman face when trying to sell their fish to the merchants. The merchants it is felt are cheating the fisherman out of decent pay. The begining moments of the film work quite well. But the plot cann't sustain the entire lenght of the plot. If this movie had been cut down to at least let's say 1 hour and 45 minutes this could of truly been an unforgettable Visconti masterpiece. As the film is now it's an enjoyable over-long Visconti epic and has choice acting moments,by non actors, &amp; beautiful cinematography.Luchino Visconti is one of my all-time favorite film-makers. He had an unmatched talent for details. He has given us so many entertaining films such as &quot;Ludwig&quot;, to me his masterpiece. Also &quot;Rocco &amp; His Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Damned&quot;, &amp; &quot;The Innocent&quot;, his final film. &quot;La Terra Trema&quot; belongs high up on Visconti's list of films. If anything just for the acting. *** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: One of Visconti's best films. A little long but has it's share of strong moments. Worth while for all Visconti fans.",La Terra Trema
265556,"The DVD's attractive packaging and the chance to see this important film in widescreen don't quite overshadow the fact that some of the extras here are nothing special.  There are two documentaries on the background of the film and much of the information is interchangeable.  Director Altman's audio commentary is disappointing; he seems uninspired, self-congratulatory, and what he says often has little apparent connection to what's on the screen.  Nevertheless, I don't want to sell this DVD short, again because it gives viewers a chance to view the film in a format that is close to what its creators intended.  Having seen old TV versions of the movie, I felt like I was seeing it for the first time.  Like many counter-cultural classics of its time, MASH doesn't always hold up well.  It is a matter of ""you had to be there"": first, the cast and crew were obviously having a hell of a good time, playing to each other and Altman, not to the audience.  In the context of Vietnam and free love, seeing this must have been exhilarating.  Now, some of it seems mean-spirited and no more progressive than the values its makers were mocking.  But, in the context of the current ""war on terrorism,"" the film has considerable power: its message is that war is a bloody farce in which every chance to get drunk or laid must be taken.",M*A*S*H VHS
