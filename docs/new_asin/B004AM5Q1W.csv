8420480,4,B004AM5Q1W,"One of the better indie short films I've seen in a long time.

Obviously done on a low budget scale, ""Opening Fright"" accomplishes what few big budget, horror/ comedies are unable to... and that is to make you laugh your head off, yet still jolt you with legitimate scares.

The writing and acting stand out the most to me. It's obvious that this film's creators have spent some time, as have I, in the glorious world of community theater. The film's very authentic in it's approach to the characters and the world they live in.

I highly recommend giving ""Opening Fright"" a once over.",1295308800,,585,4.605769230769231
8420481,2,B004AM5Q1W,"Horror comedy is extremely hard to pull off, especially when the premise is bad actors being killed in campy ways. The Ridgeland Community Theater has fallen on hard times, and with good reason. The acting is terrible, the sets look like cardboard children's toys, and the production values are abysmal. But there are still actors who want to be a part of this little theater troupe, and one of them is killing off the cast.

Opening Fright could have been ""Waiting for Guffman"" meets ""Friday the 13th,"" but there's just one problem--you can't tell where the intentional bad acting and special effects leave off and the real acting and effects begin. Sorry guys, but at $12, the price of admission is too high.",1289952000,,710,4.772357723577236
8420482,5,B004AM5Q1W,"This is a great short film to own. You get your scares and plenty of laughter. It was very well written, which was complemented by a great cast. When it ends, you'll wish it didn't. I absolutely recommend it.",1289433600,2,208,4.358974358974359
8420483,5,B004AM5Q1W,"Was lucky enough to see this, it's really funny and well done. The acting is very good all around. All in all very witty and worth your time and money.",1289174400,2,151,4.066666666666666
