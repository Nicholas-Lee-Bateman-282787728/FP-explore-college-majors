Original story with interesting characters. The acting is solid all the way around and the story has nice twists on this simple plot.
Everyone in this story is a first class A-hole loser.  Strangely enough, you'll find  a little bit of yourself  in many of those warehouse dead-end job workers....a bad day at the office, every day!

Clerks on steroids!

Fun, over the top at times but what the hell that's what entertainment is all about ain'it?",1241827200,,476,4.814814814814815
