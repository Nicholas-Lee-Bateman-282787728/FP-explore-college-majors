8393128,3,B000M8N5UM,We just finished this movie. My son is 34 months old. He has no fear of the street or dangerous things. This video will help get the message across. I wish it would have covered electrical outlets and plugging things in. My son found the scenes a bit suspenseful and slightly frightening but I think that will help him remember the dangers. The scene regarding seatbelt safety is confusing. The kids buckle their belts and then they proceed to put their monster friend into the trunk of the SUV. Why is he not buckled in as well? I don't regret buying this though. The kids are cute and my son relates to the kids and situations well.,1376179200,,634,4.427350427350428
8393129,2,B000M8N5UM,"The main character ""Trouble"" was a little scary at first.  My 4 year old neice sat up straight when he appeared and looked at me and said, "" that is not a monster"".  She was trying to convince herself of that.  I am not impressed with this video.  There are better ones out there.",1264723200,,280,4.12962962962963
8393130,5,B000M8N5UM,"I first saw the video and I was cautioned about the suspense of the film. The face of the alien is ugly. But My 3 years old daughter is in love with him. Actually she is in love with ""trouble"" the alien. The way the film explains the risks to little ones is very effective. Also I was surprised because the company sent me the product the next day. My best experience shopping on line.",1187827200,,385,4.1466666666666665
8393131,5,B000M8N5UM,"My 2 1/2 year old twins liked this movie a lot but there were a couple of parts which aren't appropriate for toddlers, like when monkey put food all over his face smearing it and when they took food out refrigerater and poured it all over.  Other than that, the movie was good.",1174867200,2,277,4.226415094339623
8393132,5,B000M8N5UM,"I am a retired schoolteacher and gave this DVD to several of my friends with small children and they were absolutely thrilled.  Their kids (3-year girl and 4-year old boy) loved the movie and asked to watch it over and over again.  Both moms said their kids retained an incredible amount of information and now even repeat back some of the sayings like ""Don't go into the road or you'll get squashed like a toad"" during the day when they're in those situations. They also loved the little blue man and the monkey.

I thought the child actors were absolutely adorable and would definitely reccommend this DVD to anyone with small children.",1174435200,,638,4.678571428571429
8393133,5,B000M8N5UM,"My kids watched the movie before I did and they started telling me about the things they should and shouldn't do that they had learned.  They thought the Monkey was fun.  I know it is a good DVD when my kids ask to watch ""Trouble and Kids"" over and over again.  There can NEVER be too many videos teaching our kids about safety.  Thank you for making one my kids enjoy watching.",1174176000,,378,4.208333333333333
8393134,5,B000M8N5UM,Excellent production and cast that brings solid safety lessons to the age group for which it was intended. A good vidual tool for all parents with preschoolers.,1174003200,,160,4.962962962962963
8393135,5,B000M8N5UM,"Our intention was not to make fun of these very serious situations. The scenes are intended to be realistic not scary - in fact the character is never injured and is simply put in dangerous situations. Making it fun could lead to imitation and mix messaging in a child's mind.

We have shown the film to dozens of kids and parents and 100% of the kids learnt and remembered all the safety lessons. In fact we are pleased that kids who have watched the film are teaching other kids who haven't seen the film about these safety lessons.

Did you know that injuries from accidents are the leading health risk facing American children? Or that drowning is a leading cause of death among kids, with most drownings happening when a child falls into a pool? Or that children under age 6 are the most frequent victims of poisoning and that common household items like cleaning products and plants account for most home poisonings?

These are terrible statistics and as parents we hope to reduce child injuries. Thank you for your support.",1173657600,,1030,4.679558011049724
8393136,1,B000M8N5UM,As a concerned parent I was not happy with this video. I was hoping it would be as good as the Stranger Safety video I ordered a few months ago. The scene with the ball going onto the street was just like a scary/thriller movie. It went too far. My 4yr old was frightened. For at lease 20 min. of this movie she hid behind a pillow yet watched it becasue I was there and yes I did offer to turn it off but she insisted on seeing if the blue character learned from his mistake(s). A learning video I believe should be both educational and fun not frightening. The blue character was a bit odd and the frig food scene was not pleasant. The only good scene was the silly lotion display and the pool safety rules. Although the intentions of those who created the DVD were probably good the outcome in my opinion along with a friend (who is a teacher) agree that it was not good. I do not recomend this dvd.,1173312000,,902,4.16
8393137,5,B000M8N5UM,"As a Child Behaviorist working on safety awareness with many children, I found that this movie was extremely insightful compared to anything I have seen or know out there. I will make use of this video and share it with colleagues and parents. I highly suggest this very fun and hopping video to parents, caregivers and even schools!!
