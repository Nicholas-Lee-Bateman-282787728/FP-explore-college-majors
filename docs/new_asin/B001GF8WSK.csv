But that doesn't really matter this anime is by far one of the greatest ever made. The story combined with great music pulls you right in and doesn't let go. while incoherent at times it more then makes up for it in every other aspect. if you like action and great story this is a must buy. Don't forget to watch the outtakes some of them are actually pretty funny. others pretty lame.",1240790400,,486,4.411111111111111
3610904,5,B001GF8WSK,"Berserk is the greatest anime of our time. An incredible story, action, and Kentaro Miura's artwork blend seamlessly to create a world that pulls you in and never lets go.

If you are a fan of anime, you need to own this series. The packaging and new cd artwork are a very nice touch as opposed to the other releases of the series. I did not notice a huge difference in the ""remastered"" version besides the original Japanese text in the beginning and end credits. Although, for some reason, the screen almost seemed to have a slight shakiness in the previous releases of the series. Whenever a scene change happened, I noticed a slight ""bump"" in the picture. That problem seemed to have been fixed in this release. The music seems more... full and robust in this version. The music in this series is a powerful accent to the already captivating whole of the series, so I found the slight music enhancements (they are very subtle) in this release to be a nice touch.

*If you own Berserk already, don't buy this unless you are a collector.
*If you do NOT own this anime, put everything else in your budget aside and buy this as soon as possible. Tell your friends! Heck, maybe your Mom might enjoy it! :D

There are plenty of reviews on the internet as to the content of the anime series and the manga (which is HIGHLY recommended!!)if you are wondering what Berserk is about. The price and packaging are definitely worth the time and money, and this series alone will guarantee personal satisfaction.",1238457600,,1500,4.58955223880597
3610905,5,B001GF8WSK,"Just to give people who are unfamiliar with Berserk an idea of what to expect, I like to compare it to Lord of the Rings. Both series have a medieval setting (knights, castles, etc.), supernatural elements, endearing characters, and a great story. Here is a quick introduction to the story: A long war is being waged between the nations of Midland and Chuder. A mercenary named Guts is forced to join the Band of the Hawk, a seemingly invincible army of young mercenaries that has allied itself with Midland. The Hawks are led by Griffith, a brilliant military strategist who wears a necklace with a strange egg-shaped trinket. Griffith values Guts, but the female commander Casca wishes that he had never joined the Hawks.

I like the structure of Berserk. There is an emphasis on continuity. Every episode picks up right where the last one left off, and themes such as friendship, identity, and ambition are revisited throughout the series.  The dynamic between the three main characters (Guts, Griffith, and Casca) is intriguing, and it evolves over time.

A caveat (or two or three)...the first episode of Berserk only makes sense in hindsight because it offers a glimpse of the future. The entire anime is a huge flashback. So if you don't like the first episode, don't worry. Just keep watching! Also, the anime ends with a shocking cliffhanger. Fortunately, the story continues in the manga. And finally, the series is quite bloody. Of course, the manga is FAR more graphic.

I highly recommend this anime series. It's incredible.

Note: The video and audio have been improved for this new release. Media Blasters is currently hosting a video that clearly demonstrates the superiority of the new release's video. Check it out ([...]",1237680000,18,1739,4.941780821917808
3610906,4,B001GF8WSK,"This box set is a slight improvement on the previous releases, but only just.

The image is supposedly progressive scan, though watching the ""Box of War"" version and this one back to back, I'm noticing no difference, even during ""fast"" scenes.  This series may just be too slow moving for progressive to matter.  The colors are slightly brighter.  The amount of grain seems to be the same, though its slightly more noticeable due to the brighter colors.  I have noticed some spots/specs in the new release that I don't see in the old, though its difficult to tell if they are all additional spots or just a different pattern.  The image is supposed to be sharper also, but I noticed no difference here.  The new release has not altered the image jitter problem.

Both soundtracks have fixed numerous minor audio artifacts.  The English soundtrack is supposed to be synced up a bit better, but I haven't found a problem spot in the old release to match against.  All discs have stereo Japanese sound.  The subtitles are edited for a better translation and corrected spellings.  (I prefer voice dubbing to subtitle reading though, so I cannot comment on that matter).

Also to mention is that the opening and closing credits have been replaced with their Japanese originals.  This wouldn't be a problem for me except the original opening uses a large ugly font that covers most of the screen (the original closing has its own issues).  In addition, the opening and closing credits now default to subtitles on, despite the fact the songs are (sort of) in English.  So, yeah, lots of text everywhere.

The chapter stops have been altered slightly.  The mid-show break now stops after the two title cards instead of between them.

As mentioned in other reviews, the discs have full-color, full-disc art printed on them.  All six discs come in a single package about 1.5 the width of a single DVD case.  Two discs overlap and attach to the inside of each cover and on one side of a leaf attached to the spine.  Personally, I would have happily payed them the whole $.25 of extra costs for a regular slim-case release.

If you don't own the series, this is a good purchase largely due to its lower price.  If you do own the series, I can only recommend repurchasing if you're a Japanese audio fan and were unhappy with the quality of the subtitles and mono tracks (and even then, I'd think it'd be a hard sell).",1236729600,19,2404,4.655581947743468
3610907,4,B001GF8WSK,"I've uploaded some scans of the discs and cover/case onto Imageshack (I can't upload onto Amazon yet for some reason). Why? Because the disc artwork is, quite frankly, wonderful.

Discs 1 & 2: [...]
Discs 3 & 4: [...]
Discs 5 & 6: [...]
Case/Cover: [...]

Now, as you can probably see by viewing my scan of the cover/case, the six discs are fitted in a standard sized DVD case. I never thought I'd live to see six discs fitted in a case so small but I have. Four of the discs go on the left and right sides of the case and the remaining two go on a piece of plastic that was fitted onto the spine of the case. The discs fit in nicely but it doesn't seem like much of a box set. At least the cover looks vastly superior to the cover of the old budget Berserk set...

My main complaint isn't with the cheap case, though -- it's with the video quality. On the back of the case it's pointed out that  the series has been ""beautifully remastered from film."" This is confusing because there's little to no difference between the video quality on the old Berserk DVDs and the video quality on these 'remastered' DVDs that my eyes can see. When I watched both versions of episode 1, the only real difference I saw was that the Japanese Berserk logo didn't flicker during the opening on the 'remastered' DVD. Hardly worth re-buying the series for!

There are minor changes included, such as Japanese text replacing English text during the opening and some subtitle changes, but nothing major enough to warrant re-buying the series if you already own it. To be honest, the only impressive thing about this re-release is the new disc artwork, which is vastly superior to the old disc artwork. Even the DVD menus and extras are the same as before.

It's 100% worth buying the series for amounts as small as 17.99 (PlayUSA) if you don't already own the series on DVD because Berserk is up there with the best anime has to offer. But, aside from diehard Berserk fans, for everyone else it'd be a waste of money.

I'd normally continue beyond this point, explaining why Berserk is in my top 10 anime list, but it's an old series and there are plenty of reviews out there that highlight its many qualities. So, instead of rambling on, I'm going to just say that you MUST watch Berserk if you're an anime fan, or even if you're simply a fan of dark fantasy.",1234569600,86,2340,4.402777777777778

3610912,5,B001GF8WSK,"I highly recommend reading the manga also. Kentaro Miura dark fantasy saga is incredible, and feels like it solidly belongs in that sort of static storytelling. But, the anime is still an excellent experience. I'm giving it full marks, just because I think it's flaws are sort of charming in that tasty 90's way. The soundtrack is splendid, but that's to be expected, because it's Susumu Hirasawa, who I best remember as the guy who's songs were stuck in my head for literal months after the first time I watched Paprika. The artwork can be rough or lazy, and it's pretty clear that they were working on a budget, but they go out of their way to deliver some gorgeousness when the moment really needs it. If you're a fan of dark fantasy, and can handle graphic sexual violence and a lot of heavy content, this story deserves your time.

3610919,5,B001GF8WSK,"I spent a pretty penny for this relic of the 90s. And I was impressed with the purchase, and it was money well spent!
To tell you the truth, I had the app ""crunchyroll"", right? You know, the app with all the anime shows and what not; for the longest time, I had seen the anime ""berserk"" for selection on crunchyroll, but, I'd never watched it until recently. I then come to find out(later on after watching all the episodes) that, the ""Berserk"" anime I had watched on crunchyroll was not an upcoming new show, but  a continuation of an older anime which brings me back this Berserk(circa 1997, if I'm wrong, correct me) that I am currently reviewing. Due to this discovery I bought this oldie and watch the *bleep* out of it.
I loved the gore, the violence, and betrayal; all makes for a juicy story that gets you going and wondering what will happen next. The story is interesting; I keep getting into it more because I can't figure out what possibly could happen next. And the story also seemed to run smooth and steady until the last few episodes, the story takes a turn for the worst(for the characters that is).
I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good story, gore, and violence.",1490313600,14,1189,4.454128440366972

3610924,4,B001GF8WSK,"My favourite animated Berserk series, even if the animation is crap at times. It has an open ending, but I'm just glad that they didn't try to rewrite an ending in.

Nice DVD set with English and Japanese dubs, and English subtitles. The set has the entire 90's anime for Berserk, all 25 episodes; none of the new movies or 2016 series. I appreciate that this set is very compact, taking up only one regular-sized DVD case. The bonus features and art that came with the set are also great!

The reason that I knocked off a star was that my particular set had a manufacturing issue: the last disc in the series had some white paint/glue substance on it (it looked similar to whatever the was used to put the art on the unplayable side of the disc). I tried to take it off with some disc cleaner, but it just smeared the substance around. It was completely unremovable, and it must have come from the manufacturer because I got the set new with the plastic wrap still on it.

I still have the disc because the art on it is so pretty, though! I ended up buying the last DVD in the set of the original DVD releases to have access to watching the end of the series.

3610932,4,B001GF8WSK,"A young wandering mercenary carrying a very large sword by the name of Guts, finds himself enlisted in a mercenary group called Band of the Hawks,  which is being lead by the charismatic Griffith. The small group  soon increases their numbers into an army; this leads them to side with the Kingdom of Midland whom have been at war with The Chuda Empire for 100 years.  Griffith hopes to one day have his own kingdom, while Guts is pretty much at a loss on what he really wants. The two will soon come face to face with their true destiny. -summary

Released between 1997-1998 and based on the manga written by Kentaro Miura. Berserk is quite possibly the most tragic anime series one can come into; and I don't mean in regards to its dreary and psychologically deep content. Instead, this is in regards to this near-masterpiece being terribly held back by a bad ending more than anything else. This 25 episode series was produced while the manga was still being written, and even up until this day the manga is still going on. Back in the 90's this series was hated by many and rightfully so, and by all accounts I should despise it for its unfinished feel as well; but I can't bring myself to even so much as disliking this title, because when Berserk is good, this anime is really good; as it possesses one of the most fluid and brilliantly written plots one can find in anime.  Despite its glaring shortcomings this is among the better anime titles one can come into.

The plot follows Guts as he's later promoted to a commander within the Band of the Hawks ranks, and during this time his sword is swung helping Griffith see his dream come true. The plot for the most part follows one battle after the other which can seem quite stale to some. However, it's the strong character development and interactions that continues breathing life into the plot. They help drive home the series serious themes of obsession, jealousy, greed, camaraderie, depression, isolation, a sense of need and more. The series is high in violence, yet violence is the main point since this is the only way many of these characters can actually express themselves due to their dark pasts. Berserk explores the good and bad of human nature, and it never gives off a heavy handed feeling.

I can't stress enough on how strong the characters are. This anime is the bible on how to develop characters; Guts is constantly at odds with himself as he tries to search for what he really wants, and although the viewers will see what he already has. It can simply be described as breath taking once he learns what he does have. Along with Guts, many of the characters break their molds and grow as people. Some of the things they do to get from one point to another can be quite disturbing and even disgusting, but this is human nature for you though. People are selfish, misguided, flawed, and sometimes we do things to obtain our goals, and Berserk plays on this among other things nicely.

Whether it's on the battlefield or even having a drink together. The characters continue to shine and this is what helps bring out a sense of realism to Berserk you normally don't see in anime. Despite Guts probably sounding like a really angst-filled character; he has a heart of gold and tons of courage as he hacks and slashes his enemies into oblivion. This anime is jam-packed with bloody action to complement its consistently dark atmosphere. I will admit that there's a bungling enemy commander here, but he does not damage the tone, nor will you find any out of place comedy to ""lighten up the mood"". No, Berserk knows what it wants to be and director Naohito Takahashi never forgets this.

Visually this is among the grittiest anime titles I know of. Berserk is a medieval fantasy and it can be felt through out; the backgrounds can be magnificent with larger than life castles giving off an indestructible feel. The battlegrounds are horrific with rows of bloody bodies draped through out the dark hallways. Then the anime shows off its beautiful snow laden backgrounds and running rivers. The character designs are serious in tone, and the facial expressions are what truly stands out, as they further carry the anime's themes. Takahashi does a splendid job showing without telling through the characters facials and movements. There are several stills to be found, and although the action is very brutal there really isn't much choreography to go crazy about. Fortunately, the action scenes do a good enough job getting its point across and looking cool while doing it.

I love the English dub and many of the sound effects. The background BGM is great following the events. However, those J-pop and badly synthesized opening and ending themes really should have been sent to another anime. They really have no place in Berserk.

Berserk is an anime that I can understand people despising, and at the same time I understand those whom love it. The beginning is almost a massive spoiler on its own, plus the ending just straight up sucks; but everything in between is just so good. Berserk has an engrossing and intricate plot with very well written characters.  This is a tough anime to recommend, but I still believe serious anime fans should give this a shot. Although it does have its bad features, the good stands out quite well also.

Pros: Consistently dark tone, very strong characters,  visuals, great use of themes

Cons: Shaky start, cliffhanger ending, poor choice of opening and ending themes",1413849600,2,5480,4.7175732217573225

3610946,5,B001GF8WSK,"Best anime/manga I have ever experienced.

I watched the anime and then read the whole manga. My first and only manga ever. The anime is a great story. The way it leaves you hanging is just mean and the first episode needs to be the last.

Still, great opening started with present then go to flash back. Book a lot better but its still fun to watch shows on TV.
As I wrote for title, great start but no ending. If they make any more seasons. It be more then 30 to complete the show. Unless they just go to main parts and go from there to complete it.

3610951,5,B001GF8WSK,"The Anime
A friend had been recommending Berserk to me for a long time. I finnally watched it and loved every minute. Anime can get annoying at times with how young and stupid it's main characters act. Berserk does not do that. It is pure action and fantastic character development from start to end. Anime for Adults, nudity that is not fan service but part of the story.

The DVD Case
A Six Disc series for $23. The price has risen a little since I bought it but come on. So many people have complained about the case. As of 11/17/2011 this boxset is cheaper than Modern Family that is only four disc and Berserk is six disc and awesome. Yes the case is a little flimsy but for a DVD that sits on my shelf that I occasionally watch, why not? I'm not hiking through the Gobi desert with this thing.",1321488000,2,799,4.256578947368421
3610952,5,B001GF8WSK,"I've been a fan of the animated series ever since I first saw it a friend's place.  I had to buy it myself.  It's still great.

As anime goes, it's got some fairly stereotypical elements; big swords, angsty characters, overdone success stories, and ridiculous comic relief in places, but still, it's a fun ride.  It's a shame it has to end on such a weird note, I enjoyed the 'realistic' storyline followed through most of the series, and without spoiling it, the last few episodes take a turn for the decidedly bizarre.

What really makes this series worth it, though, are the outtakes.  Each disc has a set of flubs from the voice actors, and some of them are HILARIOUS.  And it turns out that one of the voice actors has a real talent for singing when he should be delivering a line.

Finally, a bit of trivia; Sean Schemmel, the voice of Goku in the American version of DBZ, voices a minor part in this series and has a few funny outtakes himself.  It was cool to hear him again.",1318032000,,983,4.386740331491713

Alot of people will say ""You need to read the manga to understand this story line.  I read the manga and still recomend what I said.  You can watch this movie without reading the manga and I sugest that you do b/c you get the exact same thing out of the manga as you do with the movie.

The story was good till you reach the last 5 episodes then it take a dramadic turn Personaly I was ticked off with the ending of this it was like the writers gave up.

The Animation is typical for the dates and it can be choppy at times but can be clean at other times.

The voice acting was done well

Over all this is a Rather good anime up to the finnal 5 episodes.

What annoyed me was that you do not even find out how Guts got to where he was in the first episode.

You will really like the characters in this show and if your a fan of storytelling you are in for a treat!!!",1285977600,,665,4.807017543859649
3610960,3,B001GF8WSK,"First off let me say Im not a huge fan of the Berserk anime for reasons other than how it ended. The fact that I have to resort to the manga (Youtube. Can't find anywhere else to read it free) for a proper ending to this series p***es me off due to the fact that I get easily lost and it can be confusing at times. It defeats the purpose of having an anime abdaption. Shows like Bleach and Naruto get about 1 billion episodes, 80% of it filler, that follow the manga from page to page as I see it. But shows with dark and good stories like Berserk, Pet Shop of Horrors (4 episodes!!!), and Claymore get only 26 or so episodes with no true ending. I'm gonna try my hardest not to give away to many major Spoilers.

 The story follows Guts. A strong young Swordsman who after taking out his latest opponent during a castle siege is approached and challenged by Corcus, who is the captain of a group calling themselves The Band of the Hawks, and later attacked by thier female captain Caska but is interrupted by thier leader Griffith (just saying that name sends chills down my spine). Turns out Griffith has witnessed Guts battle at the castle siege and wagers Guts if he loses he will become part of the Hawks. Guts loses and as a result must join them. From this point on it follows Guts years with the Halks and later reveils a plot point involving Griffin and a pendant around his neck which won't become too revelent until the very end of the series.

This is the best way I can describe the plot without giving too many major spoilers. The anime has a unique artstyle to it. In some places the artstyle is extremely cunning, but in some areas of the show it shows many flaws. Im nitpicking abit. A main example of this is Griffin. His color seems to change often, early on in the series to the point where hes practically blue. Other than that the art suits the grittiness and dark feel of the anime.

Now for my major gripe: The story. Im not gonna tell what happens at the end, but let me just say its f***ed up. Personally it didn't have too much of an effect on me (the manga on the other hand did), but the fact that this dark anime just ends where the true conflict begins just p***ed me off. I don't know if its because the budget ran out or what, but this could have made an awesome series if it just continued the rest of the manga. As I said before we get so many Bleach and Naruto episodes, but more story based animes barely get any episodes. Its just unforgivable.

I actually want to give Berserk 2 stars due to that annoying cliffhanger, but decided on 3 because the ending is the main thing that will help viewers determine rather or not they like or hate the anime. I know peaple mention the manga, but not everyone likes reading manga, and isn't the point of anime is to put the story into animation? Heck I've been reading the manga for awhile now and would really love to see the events in animation form. The art is wonderful, but because Im not used to reading manga I get confused with the story. I do love how dark and sinister everything is. Prepare to get mindraped by alot of events in the manga. I can't wait to see how everything ends. I do hope maybe, just MAYBE, in the future the anime is continued where Eclipse left off, but from what I heard, thats not happening anytime soon.",1285113600,3,3316,4.273885350318471
3610961,5,B001GF8WSK,"Yes, the ending is a major cliffhanger that will leave viewers shocked and frustrated, wanting more. As soon as I was done with the anime, I had to check online to see what the deal was. You have to get the manga to finish the story. The anime only shows you the first 1/3 of the story basically. Do I wish they would've kept going with the anime series? Of course, but oh well. There's also some crucial changes & omissions of detail in the anime, so do yourselves a favor & read the manga to find out what happens.",1284249600,,516,4.17

3610963,5,B001GF8WSK,"This series tells a story about an epic journey of a two heros. The characters are great and act exactly as a person would in reality. This series would have been a masterpiece, but it ended at episode 25. Why? I do not know because the series was great.

This series starts out with Guts(the hero and main character) in his youth. He is a lone mercenary that just travels from battle field to battle field. Then he gets to this one battle where he must go against the Band of the Hawk. They are the best mercenary group out there and Guts kills one of their best men with no problem. The leader sees this and decides to leave the battle because they held up the fort that they were guard for way more time than expected. Later while walking down the road Guts is ambushed by some of the members of the Band of the Hawk. He kills one with no problem then another one of the Band of the Hawk leaders Caska enters the fight. Guts gets close to killing her, but the person that is in charge (Griffith) blocks Gut's sword. They begin to duel and Griffith wins. Since Griffith spared Gut's life he says Guts must follow him and help him become a ruler of a kingdom. So Guts decides to help Griffith in his quest for power and glory. Well that should be enough to interest you if you have not already seen the series.

This is one of the best series I have seen and the sound track is great as well. I would recommend this series to anyone that likes action/adventure/drama anime. I do not recommend this anime for people under the age of 16. There is much blood and a sex scene.",1279843200,,1573,4.222591362126246
3610964,5,B001GF8WSK,This is an awesome series with a good story and good characters. The outakes at the end of every disc ary way to funny I say buy it.,1278028800,,132,3.75
3610965,5,B001GF8WSK,"I came into this anime having owned it for years and never watching past the second episode. It takes a lot for me to actually sit down and watch them sometimes, and this poor collection is one such case.

So I watched it finally and I'm left with a pit in my stomach. There are not many things in entertainment media that have ever given me physical side effects, but Berserk is one such beast. This is not bad, but it is thought-provoking.

Berserk is set in a kind of norse-inspired dark ages, but in the classic anime style. This anime is far more ""American"" than most you would think of though. There is tons of blood, less waxing philosophical and more action, but there are well developed and thought out characters. The animation quality itself is typical 90's era type stuff. It is quite good, but it's not the more typically fluid, cg-infused stuff we're getting to see these days. It has a very particular style, as I said, less Japanese and more American, which is well designed.

The main thing I would say is that this series can be misleading at first. The beginning and the end feel congruent(you'll know what I mean once you watch it) and the entirety of the rest feels somewhat disjointed from those two points, if only because the middle serves the purposes of the alpha and omega of the plot. I know it sounds confusing, but I myself am about to go look up the Manga for this series and start devouring it immediatelly. I want to know more about Guts and his quest, I want to see where this story ends(which it hasn't yet), and I want to get my fill of an inspired invention.

Berserk is not for children. This needs to be said. No one under 16 should watch this, as listed on the dvd, 18 even for some households. There are things here that will disturb and did affect even me. Now while I've seen much worse(and more gortesque) anime, I suppose it's the fact I loved the characters so much that it tore at my heart where they go.

All in all, if you like viscous anime with lots of action, good characters and animation, and a world you will want to know more about after the credits roll, I recommend this. I personally loved it and, as I said, haven't seen an anime in recent history that affected me thus.",1276473600,,2230,4.3768115942028984
3610966,4,B001GF8WSK,"Let me start out with me start out with my information, as a viewer: I am a female, married, twenty years old, been into anime since I was twelve, enjoy many different genres (Slayers, Sorcerer Hunters, Fushigi Yugi, Great Teacher Onizuka - some of my favorites). I have never been bothered by gore in anime. However, if you can not stand avid amounts of bloodshed, disturbing images, or daunting concepts, forget about this show and manga right now.

I first heard about Berserk years ago. However, the cover art never attracted my interest. You can tell just by looking at the cover art on any of the Berserk DVD releases that this show is sure to be dark, morbid, and disturbing.

I tried getting ahold of a DVD boxset for a good price for a month, but finally gave up (I am tight with my wallet) and insteadturned to my local library for Berserk vol. 1, the manga. I had read that they were different - or, better yet, that the TV show only covered one arc of the greater manga series. The manga made me raise a few eyebrows, to be vague. It did attract me to the story line, though. Two weeks later I got this version of the DVD set at the same library.
I watched all 26 episodes within one week. Frankly, it was difficult to stop watching the show.

Many people have already reviewed the plot, characters, and overall synopsis. Read their reviews for those sort of perceptions.

Berserk has terrible opening and ending themes. The 'Engrish' is nonsensical and odd. But the song used during the previews, ""FORCES"", is ridiculously catchy and matches the show better. I read it is coinsidered the 'official theme' of the show and Guts/Gattsu (main character).

The art work is great. I like animation done in the early thru mid ninties far more than the modern stuff. I think it showcases more talent and hard work for the people on staff for the show, especially toward the end of this series in particular. The anime series is essentially based off of the golden arc of the manga. There are some details left out of the anime (I would argue intentionally).

The characters... When watching a show we don't expect to see those we have followed for so long fade in miserable ways. But everyone falls to a dark fate in Berserk. Is it because they are weak? No, not really. Bad people? Sickly, no. I think that is what makes Berserk so dark; people 'living by the sword' trying to live for some sort of common purpose all die... for that same, now lost, purpose. One moment they have the world in their hands. The next, they have become the scum of the Earth.
I enjoyed the way the characters' relationships were portrayed. The man who is silent, yet talented and well respected; the man who draws all the lead characters together, happily neglecting his own emotions; the man who challenges everyone, but loves and lives for his 'family'; the child whose eyes shine with hope; the leader who gathers everyone... then loses his dream; the woman who lives for everyone but herself, no longer seeing herself as anything but a sword in battle; the man who appreciates and loves those precious to him... when it is too late, that is.
All of them are noble to their belief in each other. Noble to the point they are lost.

I can honestly say Berserk is the only anime I have ever walked away from feeling lost, disturbed, distraught, and out of place about. Well, maybe the first TV show or movie in general. There is no 'happy ending', which I never expected anyway. There is no conclusion. There is no future, which is why Guts becomes the character he is in the first episode. There is only despaire that is unhuman... yet, if you take away the man-eating demons, disgustingly human.
Cosca's emotional dilemma in the last few episodes - most notably the last ten minutes - left me empty.

I give the TV series four stars out of five. The show itself is very good, but again, unless you read the manga or at least check out a synopsis about the books there are details avoided. Also, I liked that what 'should be' the 26th episode is the first... It was a compelling introduction. This edition of the DVD left me overall pleased. The extras on all the discs were great! FUNimation gets two thumbs up from me in that arena. However, the supposedly new 'digitally remastered' selling point is lack-luster, at best. (Granted, I have not seen the original individual six DVD releases... but video quality / transfer is something simple to judge.) The bottom of the screen sometimes looks like it would on a VHS, and at random points the transitions were not so smooth. (If you watch this version you will understand.)

If you have never seen Berserk and can find this set at a good price I suggest you check it out. But, if you already own the show, I would not advise you to pick up.",1276041600,,4779,4.528389339513326
3610967,5,B001GF8WSK,"I started watching Berserk when I was 12 when I picked up the first volume at Blockbuster many years ago.  Interested by the dark action and complex characters I continued renting them but the store only had 3 volumes.  I found this gem and had to buy it, I'm entirely satisfied with my purchase.

Although most parents think anime titles are kid shows (like Naruto and such) be forewarned that Berserk is as violent as it gets.  For gore hounds this is a plus. For 7 year olds? Not so much.  The later episodes would give most small children (and some adults) nightmares.  This however is a HIGHLY rated classic that no fan of the more mature series such as Ninja Scroll, Basilisk, and some of the infamous 90s OVAs, should miss.

It comes in a 6 disc set with bonuses like bloopers, concept art, and trailers.
