8465489,5,B005CI5M8U,"I bought this for my husband, who is a big Muggeridge fan.  He really enjoyed it.  How's that for a short sweet and to the point review?",1429315200,,136,4.0
8465490,4,B005CI5M8U,"Great info but Muggeridge's delivery is an acquired taste. He is veddy, veddy British with what appears to be an affectation of speech to sound erudite. It isn't an affectation but it takes a bit of getting used to. Also, there is a lot of poor editing. That said, the info is enough to overcome all of this.",1407369600,,308,4.327586206896552
8465491,5,B005CI5M8U,"I be read his work for a wile now, I like his way of writing, it speak t me, and want more all the time",1401321600,,103,3.16
8465492,5,B005CI5M8U,"Outstanding! Muggeridge always delights me. As always, a variation on a theme, liberalism as a seductive death wish. An ever rising GNP means nothing as humanity loses its soul.",1376265600,,177,5.137931034482759
8465493,5,B005CI5M8U,"Mr. Muggeridge brings such depth and wisdom to his subjects it's doubtful any of his contemporaries could even come close to him, especially when it comes to Christian apologetics.  Let the naysayers go on and on, let the skeptics argue, let the unbelievers rail - after Muggeridge has had his say there is little anyone can do but marvel at how foolish man is to even question the existence and the loving-kindness of God.",1365724800,,423,4.716216216216216
8465494,5,B005CI5M8U,"excellent DVD with very important historical documentary films from Malcolm Muggeridge.
We need today similar new documentary films in such stile.",1359590400,3,146,6.0
8465495,5,B005CI5M8U,"You will find helpful reviews of the book that covers this material, two thirds of their small number rating it five stars, elsewhere on this site.
My five star rating is subjective.  Muggeridge comes off as a passionate defender of the faith, but by no means manipulative.  I believe there is great benefit in considering the humanity of these men whose most common characteristic was their spiritual consciousness.
One can hardly avoid voices of God deniers or God possessors; this is something for seekers.",1346889600,10,509,5.0476190476190474
