4621395,5,B0059XTUH2,"As a parent I have had my daughter on both sides of the fence when it comes to bullying. She grew tired of being bullied and then she would take it out on others (including family). After years of counseling she has now learn to take a positive stand when it come to her being bullied as well as others. This movie has had a great impact in our family, we lost a family member to suicide, he took his life from being bullied, he was being bullied by a family member and we didn't see it until it was to late. I say this because we all will know what is going on in our schools after watching this (the schools will deny it) but, what we don't know it what type of bullying is being done in our homes. I hope this movie impacts your life, as it has impacted my families.",1356739200,2,769,4.0

I brought my eldest 3 (17, 15 and 12) to see this film in the theatre and all of them were moved to tears. I can't word strongly enough the importance of this film and the painful relevance it commands in our culture today. I strongly recommend this film to people of all ages and especially to individuals who are involved in the education field. I will absolutely buy the DVD when it is released and am hoping that it will be released with a comprehensive cirriculum as well.",1349308800,7,592,4.4907407407407405
4621397,5,B0059XTUH2,"Let's address an important issue. The MPAA ""R"" rating on this film (for six F-words spewed by school children in hate-filled diatribes) would have made it impossible for school children to see the tragic results of their venom. Filmmakers Lee Hirsch and Cynthia Lowen hoped to create a teaching moment and generate public outrage about unchecked bullying which turns schools into torture chambers for the underdogs who are targeted. Make no mistake, bullying has gone on since time eternal, but the vile that erupts from today's bullies is an eye-opener (those notorious F-words are the least of it!).

Hollywood's movie rating board consistently yields to the deep pockets of the big studios; allowing students to attend violent, bloody, profane films, because they are blockbusters, while this worthwhile little documentary lacks those big deep pockets...more bullying?

This time the little guy fought back. Instead of releasing this film unrated, which would have forced theater owners to treat it like a PG-17, canny Distributor Harvey Weinstein and theater owners have negotiated a truce with the MPAA, removed a token offensive word or two and the film will be treated like a PG-13!

I beg anyone in the education system to PLEASE watch this movie. I realize that bullying is as old as time. I was stoned on my way home from school after our family moved to a new town, so I know from personal experience what it feels like. However, I was never subjected to the unrelenting humiliation children experience today. If you can watch how his classmates treat ""Fish Face"" and not cringe, you have a heart of stone. And in my opinion, that sheriff who arrested the anguished girl with the gun was probably the biggest bully on the playground when he was a boy! We examine the lives of five victims, two of whom are already dead, suicides as a result of bullying.

Most of us have personally been confronted by the issue: many of us were bullied; many of us were witnesses; few escaped unscathed. To me, the most unsettling thing was to see (and hear) just how truly vile the school children are in today's schools. And our screening audience groaned aloud as we watched inept teachers and principals sweep it under the rug.

Yes, yes. I am aware of the ""helicopter parents,"" who hover over their darlings, aided and abetted by lawyers, always trolling for lawsuits. This system has stripped bus drivers of the authority to eject a bully from a bus and turned school administrators into wimps.

In my opinion, schools should teach children to automatically shun a bully, making it clear that his behavior is neither acceptable nor admired. If a bully doesn't have an audience, he will probably lose his motivation to dominate a classmate. The bully should be the pariah in school, not the poor kid who has always been the target. And yes, I've left parents out of the equation. If they were doing a decent job, bullying wouldn't exist!

My thanks to Harvey Weinstein for standing his ground. Now please do your part and see get film from Amazon.com and share it with everyone.",1347148800,9,3077,4.849523809523809
4621398,5,B0059XTUH2,"I was deeply touched by the severity of abuse and the lack of concern by some individuals.  I can only speak for my children's schools as I have experience with them.  Although my experiences with bullying have been minor and few I believe that not enough emphasis is put on bully awareness.  I am extremely motivated to be pro-active and bring more attention to the children in our area about bullying.
I am the parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.

My son looks ""normal"", speaks well above his years and is in advanced classes at public school.  He does not understand humor, inuendos, body language and various social cues that we all take for granted.",1346198400,9,662,4.6239316239316235
4621399,4,B0059XTUH2,"They say there is no such thing as bad publicity and if you are promoting a movie, that is generally the truth. Any publicity, any mention of your film will generally sell more tickets. Even if all of the mentions are negative, some people, all of the other 'thornhills' out there, will go to see what all of the bad word of mouth is about.

But if the publicity is good, or unrelated to the quality of the film, the movie stands to gain from the attention. ""Bully"" is the latest example of a film receiving a lot of publicity and gaining viewers from this publicity. And that's a good thing, because the film needs to be seen by lots of people to get the message out to help anyone and everyone that could be affected by bullying.

A brief recap. The film received an R-rating due to the use of the F-word a few times. Keep in mind; this is a documentary, so the footage shows real kids using this word in a negative way towards another kid. But if a film receives an 'R', many theater chains restrict access to the film. Worse yet, many schools would not be able to show the film, and use it as a learning tool. So the Weinstein Company decided to release the film 'Unrated'. Unfortunately, the major theater chains tend to restrict access to 'Unrated"" films, if they show them at all, even more than they would an 'R' rating. Generally, an ""Unrated"" film would or should receive an 'NC-17' or 'X' rating, ratings reserved for films with explicit sex. Thankfully, only one of the major chains refused to show the film. The others restricted their showings to a handful of theaters in major cities on the East and West Coasts. But word of mouth, protests and action by concerned viewers have helped to get this changed and the film is slowly expanding to more and more theaters.

Great. That is one problem solved. But why did ""Bully"" get an 'R' rating initially when a film like ""Taken"" gets a 'PG-13'? This is part of an ongoing debate about the usefulness of the Ratings Board and all of their outdated (?) idiosyncrasies. Many have long decried the fact that the Ratings Board tends to look at scenes depicting intimacy between two consenting adults much more harshly than extremely violent fare. Essentially, they are making it easier to watch violence than to watch passion and love. I would prefer my own kids to see passion and love and be influenced by that rather than by excessive violence. But violence is apparently more acceptable and much more successful at the box office.

That said, I think the ratings should be used as intended, as a guideline. When I was growing up my mother let me see practically any film I wanted to. And the simple reason for this is she knew I knew the films were not real. So I went to see horror films, adult themed dramas and R-rated comedies when I was young. If I ever saw anything that disturbed me, I knew it wasn't real so it didn't stay with me. If I needed to talk about it, I did. If your kid wants to see an R-rated film, ask them why. If you are satisfied with the answer, let them go. I have a friend who goes to an R-rated film his daughter wants to see first to see if there is anything that would disturb her. If he is okay with the film and thinks it will be OK for his daughter, he lets her go. When I asked if he was OK with a film containing excessive language, he said it didn't concern him as much as violence because he was sure his daughter heard worse on the schoolyard every day. Both good alternatives.

""Bully"", directed and photographed by Lee Hirsch, concentrates on the stories of five pre-teen and teen boys and girls, all of whom are the victims of bullying at school. The overall power of a film like this depends on the emotional impact of each of the individual stories. All five are very moving, but they don't have the same impact and that creates an uneven viewing experience.

Kelby is a teen girl who lives in a small town. When she realizes she is a lesbian and people in the town begin to find out, she and her family are virtually shut out by neighbors and lifelong friends. Her father offers to move the family, but Kelby doesn't want to give in. Kelby is a quiet young lady and doesn't talk a lot. The bulk of the story comes from listening to her dad talk about the effects of this news on their town, and how their friends and neighbors reacted. The majority of the time we spend with Kelby is spent with her and her friends, standing around, smiling, and goofing off. This story is interesting and moving, but more because of how her father relates affects of the bullying of his daughter to us. Obviously every kid is going to be different, but we need to hear the story from Kelby, to feel her emotion and how it changed her. Just watching her stand around and goof off with her friends doesn't accomplish this.

Ja'Maya is a young girl who gets arrested because she acts out against the kids who were bullying her. Her mother fills us in on the details and the story moves forward from there. Again, the story is powerful, but we need to hear more from Ja'Maya. Or have more access to see how it changes her.

These two stories, while powerful, just don't hit the same level of emotion of the other stories.

The film centers on Alex, an awkward, slightly gawky pre-teen who is so desperate for friends that he comes to think of the kids who are bullying him as his friends. When his parents eventually discover the magnitude of the problem, he states that if the bullies stop, who will be his friends? It is a heart wrenching moment and you can see the pain in his mother's eyes. Alex doesn't quite seem to realize this is a problem and that sort of amplifies the emotion for us even more.

The filmmakers are allowed access to Alex's bus and record a lot of footage of the other kids bullying him. When the problem gets out of hand, they show the footage to his parents and the people in charge of his school. His parents are mortified and arrange a meeting with the vice principal, a woman who is so out of touch she elicits groans from the audience. Before this meeting, the filmmakers follow her as she patrols the halls of the school. She watches as another young man is bullied and stops both kids, insisting they shake hands and make-up. When the victim won't, he wants nothing to do with the other kid; she turns on the victim and decides he needs to be disciplined. She goes so far as to say that because he wouldn't forgive the bully and shake his hand, he is as bad as the bully. Just when I thought my mouth couldn't hit the floor any faster, her meeting with Alex's parents just illustrates the full extent of her lack of empathy and awareness.

Alex's story is very sad, and I have to admit that I felt more than a few parallels between our lives. The funny thing is that you just know Alex is going to grow up and completely change. His quirky look will deepen and probably develop into a handsome profile, giving him the looks of an Abercrombie & Fitch model. Isn't that how most movie stars and models got started? Aren't they always the fat kid or the awkward kid? Clearly, the parallels between our lives end there.

The film opens with a father telling us the story of his teen son. As soon as he begins talking, and you realize where the story is headed, you will most likely start reaching for the hankies. Later, another father talks about the problems his son faced in school. In an effort to deal with his grief, he starts a campaign to bring attention to the problem, which begins to gain more members and public awareness, through social media efforts. Some of these group meetings are shown at the end of the film

All of the stories told are powerful, but the two most predominant narratives really tug at your heart strings. Because the others aren't as powerful, the film feels a bit uneven and less-memorable.

Also, I would really like to have seen the filmmakers tell the story of at least one kid from a big city. All of the subjects featured are from small towns in the Midwest and South. The problem doesn't exist in New York, Los Angeles or Chicago? Presenting a story from a big city, any big city, might have helped to make the film's message that the problem is universal seem more... universal.

""Bully"" is not a perfect documentary or the most powerful documentary I have ever seen, but it is very good and presents a message that needs to be seen. Should be seen. Must be seen.

""Bully"" is rated 'R' literally because of the F-word. Let's face it. Your kids hear this many times a day on the school yard. Isn't it better that they see a film that might open their eyes to a problem, might help them communicate with you about a problem, might help start a discussion  about a problem that seems to be pretty widespread?

I would say ""Yes"".",1335139200,32,8781,4.393230769230769
4621400,3,B0059XTUH2,"A lot of well-meaning people put this documentary together and it will probably make a ton of money for them. But does it really tell us anything we don't already know about bullies--- that our kids are being beaten and terrorized by them at school and little can be done to stop it?
""Never Back Down"" and the two ""Karate Kid"" films make a better case for targeted youngsters and show how guidance from a martial artist in their corner can turn things around.
Violence is always the last option, I was told by one in my corner, but if I had to stand and fight, a bully was no one to be afraid of. Because he was a coward. If he really wanted to prove how tough he was, he wouldn't  pick on the weak, he would go after the big and strong and risk getting his ass kicked.",1335052800,10,769,4.126666666666667
4621401,5,B0059XTUH2,"Not sure why Amazon lists this as ""The Bully Project"", but we are talking indeed about the documentary ""Bully"", whose initial R rating by the MPAA Caused such an outcry (more on that later).

""Bully"" (90 min.) is the self-explanatory title of this documentary, directed by Lee Hirsch (who he himself was a victim of bullying when growing up, reason for wanting to make this film). The movie basically follows 5 students in schools in Georgia, Iowa, Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma as they deal with bullying in an almost daily basis, some with tragic results. There is a lot of footage from school buses, which appears to be ground zero for bullying. I assume Hirsch was able to mount some cameras in the bus unbeknowst to the kids. What we see is sometimes shocking. In the case of 12 yr. old Alex, the bullying becomes so violent that in the middle of the movie, we are informed that the film producers were so concerned with Alex's safety that they decided to share the school bus footage with Alex's parents and also with his school principal. Next we see the parents meeting with the school's Assistant Principal, who informs the parents that she is familiar with bus 54 (the bus Alex takes) and has done that route herself on occasion and ""these kids are good as gold"" (as you cam imagine, the theatre audience I was watching this with let out a huge moan at that point). Indeed, throughout the film, school administrations seemingly do little or nothing, or are in complete denial, or both. Just outrageous. Back to the rating of the movie: the MPAA simply made itself look like a buffoon by giving this movie an R rating, when in reality this movie should be watched by every single kid in America 10 years and older. The movie's rating eventually was given a PG-13 rating (in contrast, in Canada the movie was rated PG).

I saw this movie this weekend at the Esquire Theatre here in Cincinnati, at a private screening by the Council on Child Abuse (COCA). Kudos for the great work they do in spreading the awareness that bullying is a serious issue in today's society.

My son [now 34] was bullied in Jr High. I called the principal, but it persisted. I told him is my son was bullied again, he is a Brown Belt in Tae Kwon Do, and I will direct my son to clean the floor with this bully. The principal said ""I'd have to suspend him"". I said I'd take my son out to dinner for being patient so long and help to avoid me starting legal action. I asked the principal what he'd do? He said off the record, the same thing. The next day the bully tried to bully my son. My son properly punished him, sending him to the nurses office. My son was suspended and I took him to dinner and told him how proud I was of him.

The denial from the administration is astounding, frustrating, and criminal. Your heart aches for the parents of the two young men, children really, who committed suicide. Watching the burial of the youngest victim was heart-wrenching. This is a must see for parents, students, and anyone thinking about getting into education.

The documentary covers five students encounters with bullying, actions taken by administrators, and the outcome. Sadly, the movie immediately gains your attention by introducing the story of a suicide. Each story has a different twist, whether it be why they were bullied, what they did about it, or how they reacted. However, it seemed that one major commonality was between each of the cases: the school administration did little to nothing to help the situation. This is clearly an example of bad teaching. Wherever you go to teach, odds are high that you will encounter an act of bullying. No matter the extremity of the bullying, it should never be tolerated. In the movie, one of the mothers addresses the fact that she thought school should be a safe place, and that is why she was always comfortable sending her children to school. Until the bullying incidents, she stops feeling that way. That is why as a teacher, I want everyone to have a safe learning environment that they actually enjoy being in.

It is about families telling their stories about how their children have been victimized by bullying.  Two young children ended up taking their own lives because they couldn't deal with being bullied anymore.  It is a very powerful movie, but I recommend watching it.  In this movie I thought that it was ridiculous that teachers, and even bus drivers did nothing about the kids being bullied, they just let it happen.  In every school teachers/an adult should be the first ones to do something about a child getting bullied.  I thought it was smart that the assistant principal took the students from the bus out of class and talked to them about the situation with Alex being bullied and told them the consequences if they kept it up.  When Alexs parents went into the school to talk to the principal I thought that the principal wasn't much help at all.  I also didn't like that she just handed the situation off to the other assistant principal to deal with.  Like they said in the movie parents should feel safe sending their children off to school.  Bullying is a really serious thing that should be dealt with and not just brushed out of the way.

4622280,5,B0059XTUH2,"Bully is a documentary that interviews the lives of five different kids and their parents.  Each child is bullied for different and some similar reasons.  This movie is very heart wrenching and makes people see what these victims are put through.  If one hasn't been bullied or is blind to the bullying that is occurring around them, by watching this movie they will see the emotional and physical abuse that these kids are put through.  Each kid responds to bullying in their own way some have taken their own lives, some want to stand up and fight to make a difference, some try taking matters into their own hands, and some just laugh it off and eventually don't feel anything anymore.  As a future teacher while watching this video I witnessed some good acts that teachers and parents did.  There was one-on-one time with the child being bullied; they were trying to get the victim to communicate with them, setting up meeting with the dean, having meetings about bullying at the town hall meeting, starting a Facebook page about bullying, and going to schools to make awareness about bullying that is occurring.  There are a few aspects of the teachers and faculty that I didn't agree with.  One of the victims tells of how a teacher tries to get attention in the class by saying girls, boys, and Kelby and then proceeds with harsh words towards gays.  Another person believes that the only reason why the victim shouldve brought a gun onto the bus to take matters into their own hands was if they were being brutally beaten by the other students.  Teachers don't stop the students acts of mocking of suicide of another students.  Also some of the faculty witness students who are suspicious but they don't persist and ask questions about what happened or what is wrong.  I recommend this movie to everyone! It is a great movie that makes people realize what is happening in the schools and life around them.  This is a topic that needs to be advocated and talked about and this movie does an excellent job of doing it.  Schools may not be able to promise the absolute safety of all their students and they cant make it stop completely, but all it takes is one; one person to stand up, one person to make the change to end bullying.",1427760000,,2237,4.602015113350126

This documentary tells the tales of those who have suffered from bullying, straight from the victims. It leaves those who are victims feeling nervous, helpless, lost, broken, desperate, and hurt. Schools have changes to make to fight discrimination rather than supporting it. While some schools take positive steps to change, there are still some that do not. Change needs to happen in every school, as well as a promotion and celebration of diversity. Teachers can make the first steps to change by stepping in when problems occur. This documentary shows the problems in the school system regarding bullying.
Your heart goes out to each individual that suffer from bullying in this documentary, and leads you to think about all of those who have these similar stories.

4622526,2,B0059XTUH2,"Lowballs what real bullying looks like, big time. Shame on these writers and producers. Most people, including professional therapists too often, can't handle hearing about all the things that real bullying entails. Making a film that depicted severe bullying more realistically could have been the only validation some kids who are being abused at school AND at home will ever see before it's too late. By letting victims of serious abuse know that other adults SOMEWHERE believe them and that most other adults find what they're going through unacceptable, the filmmakers could have probably saved some lives.

I gave it two stars because the film does make a couple of good points: 1.) It makes it clear to anyone who still hasn't gotten the memo that ongoing bullying can be serious enough to cause suicide. 2.) It shows a dead-on depiction of how cowardly and unempathetic some teachers and school administrators can be; when they know a child is being abused some would rather cover it up than upset anyone by rocking the boat.

It does give some examples of terrible, humiliating things that are perpetrated on the victims, but it doesn't even come close to showing the ghastly awfulness of severe, ongoing bullying in real life. It doesn't tell child victims whose abusers are school employees that what's happening to them isn't right. It sends abuse victims of all ages the message that they'd better not report the situation as it really is, because they won't be taken seriously. A lot of times that IS just exactly what happens. The person they report it to may find it easier to blame the victim than face the cold, hard truth. Thus, the film should have shown victims advocacy resources, how to develop a safety plan, and assertiveness techniques-not to directly solve their problems with the bully, the bully WANTS to hurt them and doesn't want to work things out- but to give them a better chance of getting something done by school officials, law enforcement, ect. (Thankfully, with advances in technology more and more abusers of all genres are being busted when someone is able to discreetly record the abuse-in places where doing so is legal-and to post their recording of their abuser in action on social media if their complaints aren't taken seriously at first.)

The film tried to show a child who was constantly in fear of his abusers who were also students at his school. There's the kid just nonchalantly walking home from school alone. No, in real life the victim's eyes are darting. They keep hesitating as they walk and keep looking all around, because their abuser(s)could be hiding anywhere. They may be shaking, their heart is probably racing so fast they're about to pass out, and the bullies probably WILL strike before the victim gets home.

It showed a gay young lady-probably in her early teens- who lived in the Midwest and both parents were ultra-supportive. Um, no, in the Midwest at least one of the parents would be beating the child with a Bible. It studiously ignored the fact that in schools some kids' abusers are adult ""professionals"" like teachers or coaches who are sadists who like to humiliate, or maybe even child sex predators.

Real bullying isn't pretty. Real, ongoing bullying involves stalking in some form. It's routinely being physically or verbally attacked-sometimes by more than one abuser- who hold some kind of power over the victim. It's vandalism of property, maybe even killing pets, theft of the victim's lunch money every day, persistent and pervasive slander, sabotage,  declining grades, excessive absences, trips to the emergency room, other medical bills for stress-related illnesses, and every minute of every day day being constant terror and torment. It's panic attacks and your mind always racing; your brain gets stuck in that pattern so you're like a hunted animal 24/7. It's putting off going to sleep at night because that's how badly you dread what the morning will bring. It's having PTSD do permanent brain damage and maybe becoming more prone to a heart attack or stroke later in life from the damage done by living day after day in a constant state of alarm. It's considering suicide even though you know you have reasons to live, because your level of pain is just too much to be consistent with life and you've exhausted all other options.

Victims of severe bullying usually have zero recourse because even the dumbest of bullies have an uncanny way of choosing victims carefully. They seek out loners who don't have a support network, don't have good communication skills, and may be vulnerable in other ways, too-the epitome of cowardice.

While it would be a challenge to communicate all the horror that severe bullying causes and still have the film rated PG-13 so young kids could watch it, this film didn't even give it much of a try.",1423699200,,4831,4.90452876376989

4622528,5,B0059XTUH2,"Bully is the incredibly moving, shocking, touching and suspenseful story of a heartless/coward teenager played by Nick Stahl who's such a bully that he even picks on his very best friend (played by Brad Renfro- RIP).  The ONE person who's been there for Nick all this time and he goes and picks on him.  Nick mostly picks on Brad by suddenly bursting out in an uncontrollable moment of anger and punching him in the face, giving him black eyes.  It even gets to the point that Nick walks in while Brad is doing his girlfriend on a bed, and he becomes so enraged with jealousy that he smacks/whips Brad's girlfriend hard across the back.  He beats up Brad too, making him feel weak and ashamed.  Basically all the teen actors/actresses are lazy and sit around doing sexual things or getting high/drunk all the time.  Might seem like normal teens with little ambition, but these teens are far FAR worse.

So what happens after this?  Brad's girlfriend (Rachel Miner's character) reveals while she and Brad are at the beach that she wants to go through with a plan to kill Nick Stahl and put an end to his harassing and bullying forever.  Of course at first Brad jokes it off as a sick idea, but... Rachel's serious.

For a majority of the film, we see friends and relative of Brad and Rachel all gather around in secret (mostly bedrooms, living rooms, shopping malls and beaches) to put together the perfect plan that would take Nick Stahl out of commission forever.  The problem?  The teens are afraid to go through with it.  There's all kinds of hesitation taking place in different ways.  They're afraid of getting caught for one thing.  They're afraid something might go wrong during the execution or that they'll leave evidence/blood/the dead body behind, and be arrested.

They start acting quiet and reserved around Nick once a plan develops, but... plan one doesn't work.  So they look towards another person who can help them get the job done (Leo Fitzpatrick's character).  Leo apparently has no sympathy or remorse for anything so he's the perfect person.  However it turns out (I'm SPOILING what happens here- don't read any further if you don't want to know) *all* the teens end up contributing, and as we see (this next thing I mention is a really big SPOILER) they feel a ton of surprising emotion and sadness they weren't expecting to experience once the graphic killing gets underway, with a sense of urgency now greater than ever that the evidence hasn't been fully destroyed.

This is NOT an appropriate movie for kids by ANY stretch of the imagination.  The amount of aggressive sexual situations is constant.  Nudity is everywhere.  These teens just like to do the nasty deed everywhere (even while having normal conversations they're doing it).  They even do it if their friends are in a room nearby.  I certainly don't think *I* would've been that comfortable going at it with a girlfriend at that age (alone OR with people in a room nearby) but hey, I never had a girlfriend so who knows!  I find it shocking that Nick's dad is strict and wants to make sure his son gets into a good college with a beneficial future.  Even though Nick is an abusive, angry, out of line, immature sex-craved woman and friend beater when he's with his friends, he turns more polite/respectful around his father.  You'd think he'd be so screwed up in the head he wouldn't have the least bit of concern showing politeness around his father, so I find this part odd.  Perhaps he's afraid of his father.  We'll never know since we never see the father express any kind of anger- just a strict ""you will do what I say"" attitude.

Seriously this movie is downright crazy.  Every single teen actor and actress is devoted enough attention that you eventually care about all of them (and there's like what, 10 nervous teens standing around by the end?) and the facial expressions they often show when discussions get intense and plans enter the developmental stage are startling enough to leave you speechless.  REALLY high quality acting by everyone.  Bully takes bullying to a whole new level.  If you can stomach witnessing a violent death because of a bunch of teens going through with their plan to take out a bully, this movie will definitely leave a strong impression on you.  The phenomenal acting, the tight storyline, the memorable characters, the atmosphere wondering when the inevitable is finally going to happen and how it's going to happen... Bully is just a crazy film.  I thought I watched this movie several years ago but I don't think I did.  I'd remember something like this.",1423526400,,4589,4.732997481108312

4622742,5,B0059XTUH2,"I was small, I wasn't good at sports, I wasn't popular, and I was bullied in middle school and high school.  In Mississippi of the 1970s there were no laws that compelled me to attend school and I hated it so much that I became an intractable truant.  I eventually dropped out of high school twice, first in my sophomore year and then in my junior year.  Ive never forgotten it, Ive never forgiven it, and I was therefore particularly interested in seeing the 2011 BULLY, also known as THE BULLY PROJECT, which documents public school students who are repeatedly victimized by their so-called peers.

BULLY follows the hell-on-earth lives of several children who find themselves targets.  School buses are often nightmares, and two of the stories involve children who are relentless tortured and who find no aid in their bus drivers, who prefer to look the other way.  One child, a girl, is so frequently harassed that the she steals her mothers gun and threatens the other children on the bus, a decision that lands her in all sorts of legal hot water.  Another child, a boy, is punched and choked until the horrified filmmaker decides to turn the footage over to the boys parentsparents who discover that the schools response is somewhat less than they desired.

Most painfully, the documentary details the deaths of Tyler Long and Ty Smalley.  Long suffered from aspergers syndrome and was repeatedly and viciously attacked for being different.  He was about seventeen when the abuse drove him to kill himself by hangingand in response a number of the students who bullied him wore nooses to school.  Ty Smalley was also repeatedly and viciously attacked; his hanging suicide at age eleven prompted his parents to found Stand for the Silent, an organization that works to prevent bullying.

As a film, BULLY has plenty of shock moments and plenty of anger momentsbut director Lee Hirsch, himself bullied in school, takes to the material with a clear and exceptionally unsentimental eye.  The film offers no easy answers about how to protect the bullied student, much less how to manage the bullies themselves.  Ultimately, the school system comes out looking the worst, unwilling to give straight answers to straight questions, unwilling to even send representatives to community meetings on the subject.

Some things have changed since I was in school.  In my day, any suicide that occurred was attributed to the kid being crazyhe was, in effect, bullied even after death.  Today a suicide is more likely to be more deeply examined and therefore better attributed.  But quite frankly the bullies still get away with it, the teachers have little will or power, and the authorities look the other way.  Kids will be kids.  Boys will be boys.  Its a phase.  They all go through it.  Right?

The DVD includes a number of additional scenes.  Recommended for parents, school children, and perhaps most importantly, for teachers and school officials, all of whom could learn a thing or two from it.",1415577600,,2995,4.906560636182903

This documentary will provoke you to tears several times ""IF""....... you can even watch the injustice our system allows to happen,or you turn it off and pretend it's not a big deal.

I'm privileged to see kids that are far wiser and WAY stronger than the adults in their lives.
You'll see the school teacher named Kim that was dumb as a sack of rocks and lied to the cameras so she would get no blame, and didn't have a CLUE what to do to protect those that couldn't protect themselves. She thinks people make these stories of abuse up was her mind-set. I just wanted to scream at her stupidity of not going to the parents of the bullying kids and lay down the law, but instead closed her eyes and pretended these things didn't happen. ""Oh I was on THAT bus, and they were all angles"" she said, and actually thought that was the truth with no understanding they're not going to do things in front of her. Just totally ignorant and incompetent, and should share the blame of that child's death.

Then the parents that don't see this is too much for their children to deal with, and long ago they simply shut down and can't help themselves now, while the parents ask demeaning questions like, ""do you LIKE being a punching bag?"" The husbands that are too COWARDLY to even speak up to the teachers in meetings and keep silent as their beautiful child gets beaten. I'm ashamed of every one of them that also need to share the blame of these events as they did next to nothing along the way, and then act so outraged and defiant after the deaths, as if that defiance will do anything to make things right. Where was that defiance and outrage at the teachers and school boards and police that did NOTHING when they had time to help these children?.

This should be required course viewing in every school, and at least that would change some people, but dealing with teachers that are fools and parents that simply don't care, is a challenge I have no good answers for other than home school.
I do know this...one kid touches my boy or girl with a bullying hand and my life's work will be to protect that child from harm.....not give speeches after the damage is done. Not even a word said about the thousands who's self image is ruined all their lives after these events and destined for failure.

The truth is, most all of you in the system are at fault here thinking a child is lying or making things up, so you do NOTHING, so you don't get a PARENT UPSET with you or get in trouble.
Every teacher in those children's lives should be FIRED today and gotten rid of, to make it safer for other kids to go to school.

I never use bad language, but seeing this film made me want to call every one of these people in this film some terrible names....except for the kids here that were far smarter,and far stronger than ANY of the so-called adults.

Now I see why the world is like it is, with a downward spiral as I got to view the incompetent, cowards in charge of directing the systems that abuse the children we send to school..
Hang your heads in shame...you deserve to feel badly.

A good documentary about an awful subject.",1407196800,,3320,4.3624595469255665

4623000,2,B0059XTUH2,"I did not like this film as i feel it does not give a honest and educational view of bullying. Regardless of how well meaning the movie makers intentions are the film is very good at making you tune into the primitive feeling of us and them or good vs evil and bullying is not a black and white issue. It does this by heavily editing the footage and leaving out some important questions and answers which i will list below:

1. Anyone can be a bully- 'Bullies' are not sociopaths or kids from bad homes, but your everyday kid. Hate to say this, but bullying is wired into humanity, it goes back to our tribal times, where if you were weak, different or did not conform you were bullied to get in line or you died off. People with very poor social skills or weird mannerissms are susceptible to this!(ie the main kid from the film)

2. Fathers play a huge role in if a kid gets bullied especially boys- Alex's dad in this film was a clown. He does not lead the family, and much of the running of the family seems to fall onto the mother. Because of this he doesn't know how to act very masculine seems to act very passive and sensitive(feminine traits).This draws bullying as boys will like the feeling of dominating you and how more masculine they feel compared to you.

Half way through the film we see Alex's dads attempt to connect with his son. He tells him to stand up for himself, Alex's reaction is to look at his dad like his an alien, not likely seen him do that himself or for his kids. He then goes on to shame the the son telling him that if he doesn't stick up for himself the 'bullies' will likely be after his little sister. Jeez, as if this guy didn't have enough on his plate already. His sister then tells him he is 'weird' and that is the reason he gets bullied, the scene ends seconds later. Although i don't think the family in anyway are bad people it seems very dysfunctional. Maybe they are socially isolated and don't enjoy themsleves as much and alex has become the family emotional dumpster when people get frustrated or upset. You can say all you want, but how we are treated at home effects how we view ourselves and how we relate and get on with other people.

3. Standing up for yourself- A kid who's friend who recently had committed suicide talks about how he used to get bullied alot and how he suddenly stood up for himself. He says it in a pretty casual manner as though it took little effort, he then concludes that the 'bullies' now leave him alone. Kids need to be taught to be proactive and take care of their problems because life doesn't get any easier once they leave school.

I could add a lot more examples, but i just wanted to show how i think this fil was flawed. If you want to feel like your part of a movement your're probably like this film, but if you want the truth probably best to stay away..",1406073600,2,2848,4.276437847866419

4623041,3,B0059XTUH2,"I thought this was going to be educational, thought-provoking movie, due to all the ratings and publicity it received, but all it did was make me angry.
First, let me say that my heart truly goes out to all the families. I live less than 30 miles from Chatsworth, GA so I am very familiar with the Tyler Long case. I feel the Ja'Meya Jackson case was poorly handled, especially by the sheriff.  The Kelby Johnson case- the individuals who hit her with the van should have been arrested and charged with attempted murder. The teacher who talked to Kelby about how they used to burn gays/lesbians individuals, during class, more than once, should have been fired. The Smalley family, heartbreaking. The superintendent said there was ""no indication that bullying occurred"". Maybe get off your phone and go spend a little time in the schools and you will see bullying.
Alex Libby- this one made me the maddest. Alex was let down by the school, the administration and even his own parents. And his little sister came across as a spoiled brat. She and her father made it all about HER. What was Alex going to do if she was bullied? Because all the kids at her school think ""he's creepy"". And the father telling him to man up? And the mom asking if he liked what was happening?? Really people? You are his parents and you are being just a hurtful as the bullies.

That Kim Lockwood lady- she is completely clueless. Scolding the one kid for not wanting to shake his bullies' hand? Then saying the kids on Alex's bus are ""good as gold""? If that is her definition of ""good as gold"", then I would really hate to see her definition of a bad kid. It says in one article that she got up and apologized to the audience about how she came across during a screening in Iowa. Big deal. She needs to apologize to Alex and all the other kids she was a complete moron to. Another administrator asked Alex didn't they take care of the problems when he reported them? He said yes, but then they do other things. She did not have a snappy comeback for that one.
All in all, it was just ok for me. It would have been nice to have more follow-up, maybe talk to the actual bullies. The CNN piece on this was more heart-wrenching to me. I think what Mr. Hirsch has tried to do it great and I hope is truly does help. But I think we have a very long, tough road before any real changes are made.",1396224000,5,2367,4.340857787810384

[NOTE: this entire review can be construed to contain spoilers, if that word has any meaning when one is discussing a documentary. Proceed with caution.]

I don't quite know how to review Bully. My proposed method of dealing with many of this film's subjects could possibly, if I aired it here, be considered advocating violence. (And it is.) That's not something you're supposed to do these days. After all, consider the fate of Ja'Meya Jackson, one of the five teens in this movie who fall into the category of what Jean Shepherd called the nameless rabble of victims. She was bullied, she decided to do something about it, and not only did she get arrested and sent for psychiatric evaluation, but director Lee Hirsch leveraged the incident to include one of the movie's most startling, offensive interviews, in which an adult who obviously has no memory of his own school days says he cannot imagine there being justification for Jackson's actions unless the other kids were beating her in the head every day. How much do you want to bet this idiot was a bully himself, back in the day? And in the interests of full disclosure, I'll tell you this: I was in high school quite a while ago (I graduated in 1986), when things were a little more relaxed than they are now vis-a-vis what you could and could not have with you in school. You know that scene in one of S. E. Hinton's novels where the main character mentions the scalpel he was using in science class was too dull, so he pulled out a switchblade to open up a worm, and the reaction of the kids around him was not OH [censored for Amazon consumption] THIS KID HAS A SWITCHBLADE!!! but wow, you really are a hoodlum? Things weren't that relaxed by the early eightiesI would have been sent to detention had I been found outbut I too was one of that nameless rabble of victims, and for three of my high school years I carried either a stiletto or a butterfly knife with me every. single. day. Why? Because I had a knife pulled on me by a bully in eighth grade, and I was lucky to get away with the small amount of blood he drew. This is not a new problem, and all that we've managed to do in the intervening quarter century is make bullying easier and more pervasive by taking away every tool the victims have to defend themselves. Someone turning a camera on this problem was long overdue. Lee Hirsch finally did it, and what I saw didn't change my views on how to deal with bullies one iota, save to reaffirm them something fierce.

The main problem with Bullyand I use the term problem perhaps in a nitpicky sense, though seeing how things would have gone had Hirsch taken this approach would have been interesting indeedis that Lee Hirsch is not Frederick Wiseman. In Wiseman's classic muckraker Titicut Follies, Wiseman got the shocking footage he did because he and his crew stayed at the facility for so long that they eventually, to the guards, became as visible as potted plants, and this allowed Wiseman to capture things on tape that no thinking human being would ever consider doing in the light, much less on film. Hirsch and his crew never achieved that level of invisibility, and if I had to put money on it, I'd wager a year's pay that the actual bullying that got caught on tape is only the slightest tip of the iceberg. We hear much more about the bullying that goes on in high schools than we actually see, and as we all know, you can tell people things until they're blue in the face and the majority of them will simply not listen. If you really want someone to understand the depth of the problem, you have to show them that it exists. Hirsch does not do this, and to me, the movie suffers for it.

This is not to say that what we get is not valuable, and the Ja'Meya Jackson story (and resultant school-official interview) I referenced above is worth the price of admission by itself, in that regard; I haven't checked, but I can't imagine that genius still has a job. If he does, that condemns the entire school board that employed him. Everything else to be found here is just bloody icing on a black-and-blue cake, and there's a whole lot of it. The evidence that this problem is much, much worse than you thought it was is sitting right in front of you. Maybe it's time to start listening. And for the love of god, people, when the bullied stand up for themselves and bullies end up in the hospitalor undergrounddon't punish them for it. Give them medals. ****",1389571200,,4471,4.4822085889570555

4623137,5,B0059XTUH2,"It is one of those problems in American society that oftentimes doesn't get talked about by people in charge until it's too late.  The problem is school bullying.  It is a problem in which the victims are never given any support, where the perpetrators are not only often never punished but also sometimes even rewarded for their actions, and families of the victims often have to suffer in silence because, seemingly, no one in authority gives a damn.  The end result is either young kids who are ostracized to the point where they commit suicide, or put into such desperate straits that the only resort left open to them is to go on shooting sprees in which a lot of people die.  That is the subject explored in documentarian Lee Hirsch's compelling and very unnerving 2012 film BULLY.

During a single school year, Hirsch and his film crew follow the lives of five families growing up in seemingly perfect small towns in the Midwest and the Deep South, who nevertheless have found their kids to be the target of bullies in school.  These are your basic all-American families in seemingly all-American small towns confronting what has become an all-American problem.  Their kids are often singled out for abuse of all kinds for various, unexplained reasons.  Some of it is physical, but much of the times, the abuse is verbal, and quite extreme at that.  Three of the five families suffer because the abuse against their children became so great that they felt they had no other choice but to end their lives.  One family confronts the fact that their child was pushed into a corner and threatened her tormentors with a gun.  Another family's child took proactive measures and encouraged other kids to stand up.  But whether the outcome was tragic, confused, or hopeful, they all had to confront something that is far too common in America, and has been that way for far too long: People, especially children, who are even slightly ""different"" in some way, whether they are socially distant, have learning disabilities, or are not of the right skin color or ethnicity in certain towns will be singled out; and those in authority will turn a blind eye, giving the bullies the right to sanction their victims.  It has become a critical epidemic in America, one unfortunately promulgated by ""heroes"" like General George S. Patton (""Americans love a winner, and will not tolerate a loser."") and NFL coach Vince Lombardi (""Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing"").

People in authority, as the film shows, often don't take the kind of proactive steps to stop bullying that the parents of those victimized do, and thus seem to sanction the bullying--much of the times, that abuse is more verbal than physical, with the use of sexual, racial, and homophobic slurs.  And while Hirsch and his film crew focused on the Midwest and the Deep South, the truth is that this kind of bullying is an epidemic in all corners of America.  BULLY, however, is not so pessimistic as to wallow in the grotesque, although it has to focus on the grotesque at times for people to really stand up and care more than they have in the past.  We also see the parents of bullying victims standing up for themselves, alongside other parents whose kids may not have been the victims of bullying but who nevertheless empathize with those that are, and taking their case all the way to the state houses.  It's sad that it takes this kind of devastation to make politicians know what kind of a corrupt culture has been fostered in America that allows bullying to happen, but at least now they are on notice.

BULLY, in essence, is a cinematic manifesto against a disgusting tradition in America culture that needs to be stopped.  And if it even slightly succeeds in making a dent in this ugly underbelly of American life, it will have done a huge amount of good.  It is an important film, a definite must-see, without question.",1387843200,,3900,4.7481481481481485
4623138,4,B0059XTUH2,"Today kids are killing themselves and each other at an alarming rate. The one thing all these cases seem to have in common is bullying. There was bullying when I was a kid, but 3 PM meant the end of the trouble. We had the rest of the day, the weekend, and the summer to recover. The advent of social media and cell phones has made the respite obsolete, as now, bullies can torture their victims 24/7. Bully is an award winning documentary that looks at the problems of bullying and shows the effects it has on children's lives. What I like about this film is that it showed a whole group of students from different economic, social, and ethnic backgrounds. What I took away is that anyone who is even slightly different in anyway, could be a target. What I didn't like was the solutions the film offers. Their solution is to tell someone and to stand up for kids you see being bullied, but anyone who has been bullied will tell you that those are not good ideas. Often times telling someone will anger the bully and make it worse, and as for standing up for other kids, often times that makes someone who wasn't previous bullied, a target. I think the answer is two-fold, in that first, parents need to tell their kids, from a very earlier age, that being unique, different, and even weird are admirable qualities in a person. I also believe the schools need to be tougher, because honestly, does anyone really think that giving a bully detention, telling them they're not nice, and that their hurting other kids really does anything? I think bullies need a taste of their own medicine, to feel those powerful emotions for even for just one day. You can talk until you're blue in the face, but you don't really know what something is like until you've experienced it for yourself.",1387584000,,1781,4.5170278637770895

4623188,3,B0059XTUH2,"Trying to rate this film using the star system is difficult and misleading: if I were judging the film's effectiveness in portraying how vicious kids can be to each other, how damaging bullying can be to one's self-esteem, or how generally inept school officials are, I would give it a resounding five stars.

My main problem with this film is that it identifies bullying as the underlying problem, and demands that the same system that has created these soulless little monsters do SOMETHING--anything!--to fix the problem.  Meanwhile, children suffer and parents wring their hands.

It broke my heart to watch the abuse the children in this film endured, and I cried for the parents who lost their children to suicide.  However, the blame must be placed where it belongs: squarely on the shoulders of those very parents.  It was THEIR job to protect their children, and for whatever reason, they did not do it.  No child should be allowed to suffer daily torment...but it is not up to the government to see that this doesn't happen, it is the parents' responsibility.  Why do we, as parents, expect someone ELSE to do this job?

Rather than expending energy trying to fix a system that is defective at its core, we need to be fighting to change state laws that require mandatory school attendance and restrict parents' rights to care for their own children, including the responsibility for educating them however they see fit.

The State has convinced most of us that we are incapable of adequately educating our children.  THIS IS A LIE!  Just look at what the schools are actually teaching: conformity, passivity, and deference to authority, and at the same time fostering aggression, frustration, and anger.  Schools (even the best ones) provide an environment frighteningly similar to prison, with a dangerous and powerful ""upper-class"" that uses its power to beat down the most vulnerable, those who need the most care and protection.  Why would we subject our children to this often-arbitrary and always capricious system?  For the ""education"" it provides?  Many kids leave school without being able to read, and those that can often choose never to pick up a book again!  Many college students can't name the two political parties, or the two countries that border the U.S., and many college graduates are not able to procure employment in their field of study...and often don't know any more than when they started school.

Before anyone gets riled up, I am not suggesting that schools should be abolished totally, but they should be used only as a last resort.

Bullies aren't the problem, they are a symptom of the problem.  The REAL problem is that we have handed our parental power and responsibility over to a governmental system that does not have--nor will ever have--our individual well-being as its priority.",1383782400,3,2828,4.966029723991507

4623191,5,B0059XTUH2,"This is a truly excellent, yet disturbing documentary which follows a few typical American families affected by the scourge of bullying. The most alarming and tragic part of the film is the realization that some of these kids are even committing suicide at a young age, in order to escape the pain and torment they feel from being bullied! Real solutions are not offered or discussed in any kind of depth, being that this is of course a complex subject open to many, varied solutions. The purpose of the film was to show what bullying is or can be like, and how it negatively can affect families and communities. Personally, I feel that there should be national anti-bullying laws on the book, because clearly a large cross section of parents (and school administrators) in this country don't know how to be good, rational, helpful ones.  For example, one of the teen subjects in this film was being bullied and ostracized simply for being gay. Of course, she was growing up in a small, homogenous Bible belt 'cow town' in Oklahoma. No surprise here! Close-minded, overly religious, hatemongering, insecure zealots who view homosexuality as a 'sin' or perversion (it's not- you are BORN this way) often raise their kids to shun and/or ignore others who are gay anyway.  Anti-bullying laws would not only protect our kids from the bullies themselves-  they would also protect kids from the sheer ignorance and hate that stems from hateful and prejudiced parents as well!

I'm 21 years old and I've been out of high school for over 3 years now and this movie moved me in ways I cannot explain. It's heart-wrenching and it does it's job at making people question how serious bullying is. I was bullied since 15 and when I was in middle school and high school my parents and I fought tooth and nail to see something happen, yet nothing ever happened. It wasn't considered ""serious"" enough. I was cyber bullied as well and the school told me it doesn't concern them. I'm so happy that this movie was made. It shows just how vacant our minds are of how serious this is.

I got into drugs & alcohol around 15 due to bullying. I had one failed suicide attempt. All of this information was known by my school, yet their only solution for me was to continuously just change my classes to the point where two of my classes I spent alone in the office to avoid interactions with other students. I didn't get my picture perfect high school life because of harsh people with no consequences. I'm proud that this movie was created. In a way I felt like somebody else was on my side for once. I felt every harsh word and action done to these kids in this movie. It hurt to see kids so young have to endure what I endured. I can't even begin to describe the heartbreak I went through seeing the parents of the children who took their lives.

I gave this movie a 5 star review because it deserves it. Kids who are going through bullying deserve to see this and deserve to know that someone is on their side, like I feel. The direction of this movie is amazing and I adore the cinematography. It give an amazing insight on what really is going on. I saw some reviews say that they hated this movie because it doesn't solve anything in the end. That's the point. The entire point of this movie is to show the audience how nothing is being done about bullying. It's showing how horrible the situation has become. This movie is suppose to be part of the solution. It's suppose to open your eyes and your hearts. I recommend this movie for ANYBODY. It really does pull at your heart stings.

4623230,5,B0059XTUH2,"Most of the stuff made to show kids at school about bullying has them rolling their eyes as adults who think they know what's cool and that kids will be into really haven't a clue. This was very moving. It didn't talk down to kids or adults. It didn't sugar coat. It shone a light on the realities. it showed what REALLY happens when you take a problem to the administration of the school. They give you some nonsense and send your kid right back out with no changes. Often the bullied child is blamed by adults and schools seem to think that a kid who says ""wow, I didn't know I hurt your feelings... I was just kidding around"" really actually isn't just saying that because the adult is standing there. It's insane to me to believe some adults don't know what is actually going to happen to the poor kid the minute there are no adults around.

Parents have to teach their kids that it is OK to be who they are and that they don't have to fit in and that they do NOT have to take the kinds of nonsense we see in this film. Parents need to let the school know that if it does not stop, they will press charges themselves and will contact the local news about the school's lack of enforcement.

More importantly, parents have to teach their kids to have compassion for other people and to treat them the way they would like to be treated. You don't have to be friendly with everyone but you do have to be polite. You don't have to like everyone, but you do have to be kind. You do have to stand up when you see something wrong is happening.

Schools have to learn that kids from wealthy families are just as big a problem as kids from poor families and often times are worse but know better how to cover it up. It doesn't matter who your parents are if you are treating others badly. It doesn't matter if you are attractive if you are also a bully. Just because you are in the popular crowd, doesn't mean you are a nice kid. In fact, it probably means quite the opposite.",1377648000,4,1970,4.2063492063492065
4623231,3,B0059XTUH2,"I found this film as powerful and heartbreaking as I had expected to; as a former educator, watching the inaction of school administrators was especially shocking.

I do have to say, I wonder why all the case studies in this movie take place in poor, isolated, rural towns in the south. The implication that this kind of behavior is somehow tied to poverty is ridiculous and inaccurate; bullying happens among children of all classes. The idea that richer, better-educated children are spared from this world is really problematic, and the conspicuous absence of these kinds of kids makes me question where this director, who obviously has his heart mostly in the right place, is coming from.",1377302400,4,692,4.9655172413793105

Off topic...a lot of folks are now doing home school through Connections Academy and various other online learning centers.
It's worth checking out. If you kid is being bullied that badly that it's interfering with their ability to learn than online is a safe, legal, approved way for you child to get the education they need and deserve without the gangs, drugs, bullying and teachers that don't care.

4623256,5,B0059XTUH2,"I am a man who happens to be gay and who also happens to be diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. I found this movie to be a very difficult one to get through. This is not because the content was bad, but because the fight to end this problem is just beginning. I felt a sense of anger when the school administrators refused to acknowledge the seriousness of the issue and to hold the bullies responsible for their actions. I felt a profound sense of sadness when I watched the parents of Tyler Long and Ty Smalley grieve the loss of their precious child. I felt disgust when the pastor from Murray county said that people came to school the next morning with nooses around their neck as a blatant insult to his grieving family. (Tyler hung himself after the bullying became too much for him to endure.) I felt ashamed when the police officer tried to push all of these charges onto a notoriously bullied girl who was being targeted by a gang of five kids. Ja'meya felt completely helpless, so she felt that bringing a gun onto the school bus would intimidate her classmates and convince them to leave her alone.

I loved all of the families in this documentary, but the two that stood out to me the most were Kelby and Alex. Both of them have tried their hardest to find positive ways to handle their pain. Alex is now a freestyle rapper (about bullying) and Kelby advocates for state and federal legislation that is intended to protect bullied LGBT youth.

4623258,5,B0059XTUH2,"I was the classic bullied child- wore think glasses, was nerdy,  was the last person picked in PE, and had trouble making friends.  This documentary brought back powerful memories  of elementary  and junior high school nearly 40 years later.  The bullying scenes  on the school bus were particularly ""nostalgic"".  My mom still likes to tell the story of the time I gave a kid a bloody nose on the school bus after I had had enough and how I was worried that ""I would go to jail""  My thought is nothing has really changed in 40 years, like other social problems it is just receiving more attention.  And the responses of school personnel,  especially the blonde  woman principal haven't changed in 40 years and border on ignorant,  especially the scene where she makes two boys shake hands.  My elementary principal did the same thing 40 years ago!  Like that is really going to solve the problem?  Even  all these years  later (I am in my early 50's and married) watching this made me feel that I was ""not alone.""  On a positive note at least now there are more resources to help bullied children and there is an ""awareness"" of the problem. But I was thinking that in the early and mid 1970's  I never had to deal with ""cyber bullying,""  In my case, the bullying began to subside in my junior year of high school and as such,  my first positive social situations  (such as the first girl who liked me-early in my senior year- even though she was probably less ""popular"" than me) that much more sweet.

More needs to be done to educate school administrators, teachers, parents and students that bullying is not acceptable, how to encourage bullied children and their families to come forward and that its not the bullied child""s fault.",1373760000,,1734,4.594771241830065
4623259,5,B0059XTUH2,"Well, this film is nothing if not timely. Just seeing the reactions of the parents of the victims is proof enough of that. Unfortunately, what I see here are a lot of lofty platitudes and little action. It is doubtless that what each of these children are experiencing is nothing short of assault and battery, harassment, stalking, theft, and death threats that would get any adult thrown in jail. But therein lies the problem. Children aren't treated like people in this country. They are either vaunted as being blameless ""little angels"" (by the principal who actually sees these kids being bad and turns a blind eye) or treated like someone else's burden. What I believe is the larger issue here (the elephant in the room, if you will) is that there simply is nothing that anyone can do to stop bullying in a country that admires bullying, be it financial, racial, or sexual. That is the real issue these parents need to be aware of. So long as those perpetrating the bullying are not subjected to the full legal ramifications of their actions that they would face if they were adults, it will never stop. If the parents here really want bullying to stop maybe they should start treating their kids like people instead of just little inconvenient burdens they have to deal with (I don't speak for all the parents when I say this but the guy blaming his own son for not being able to ""man up"" and somehow manage to physically defeat those subjecting him to brutal physical assault needs a vasectomy asap.

4623315,5,B0059XTUH2,"Just going through the short amount of time with Alex, as an outsider looking into his life, led me on an excruciating pathway.  Director Lee Hirsch has filmed the lives of children (including 12 yr. old Alex) and their families that are struggling in the midst of indescribable suffering.  There is no acceptance of children that may or may not be different, no remorse for actions taken against them, and seemingly minimal help for aiding these situations where other children are the instigators themselves.

Being ""victimized"" is what is being explored and is brutally displayed; this documentary is not for someone who wishes to simply be entertained, this is what hopefully builds advocacy.  Done with so much emotion and feeling, I could barely get through the painful viewing of this.  I found this running through my mind, over and over, and asking myself how this could still be ...

It has gotten to the dire point, with some like Alex, that they are unaware of even being abused.  The descriptive expletives, used to scare and demean, are to a much more heightened degree and thrown around like idle quips while menacing another.  Suspicion, ""I see you guys laughing over there"", is pervasive for kids at school who are always on the lookout for the bully.  ""I feel like I belong somewhere else"" becomes the general consensus for the isolated and 'targets' of this behavior.  Suicide attempts and following through with it have become a viable option for our children ...

The 'differences' that may be celebrated about us as adults are life changing and soul-damaging for a child.  If these things are even noticed in them, they are considered a 'weakness' and they become the target for the former said abuse.  This goes way beyond the old ""kids will be kids"" thinking, this is criminal on a scale that left my jaw dropped, right in the position that it started out in.

An extremely painful and gut-wrenching documentary that possibly, if in the right hands, could make a difference.  It would be better served on the national level, although making its people aware is the start of any change.  I certainly hope that there is a follow-up made to this to show what, if anything, has changed since the time of filming this one.  Not a documentary for the weak at heart, or maybe that is a better place to start from for this emotionally powerful view.",1371859200,4,2365,4.771498771498772

4623418,5,B0059XTUH2,"I watched this documentary wondering what, if anything, can be done about bullying? Because many of the officials spoken to in this film, seemed to be at a loss about what to do.

There were certain things that weren't said in this film, that needed saying. First, I do not think many of the school officials shown, were being purposely obtuse. I don't think they don't care. I don't think the bus drivers don't care either. I think we live in a truly heinous, pop cultured society, mixed with technology, that can make a well meaning person look like the bad guy. How many times have you seen on your local news, a bus driver taken to task for trying to stop some incident on a bus? Next thing he or she knows, they're on the nightly news or Youtube, and they are not depicted as having tried to help out. They're made to look as if they roughed up one of the kids, or worse yet, touched them inappropriately. I suspect that that is just one reason why the people parents look to, to keep the peace when bullying gets out of hand, look the other way.

Secondly, while the rallies and gatherings were touching, where were all of these people when these young kids were suffering horribly? Where were they? The kids that took their lives, might have thought twice if they knew so many people had actually cared. Then again, maybe that is a lesson to be taken away from this. Step up and help out before bullying goes too far.

Alex's problems were the most heartbreaking. His parents were well meaning(or thought they were), but how would their son be expected to deal with a situation like this, without some guidance? And poor Ja'Maya. Bullied and living in Mississippi. I thought that police official was the stereotypical, backwater sheriff, or whatever he was. His lack of empathy, I thought, was truly racist. Truly. Because I had no doubt, that if Ja'Maya had been White, and on a bus with that same crowd of Black kids, going through the exact situation, he could've found a way to understand why Ja'Maya had done what she did.

What was missing from this documentary, and understandably so(they'd be stupid for showing their faces on camera), were the points of view from the parents of the bullies. Why do they think it's alright that their kids are terrorizing other children? I think one thing that would go a long way in helping, is if God forbid, one of these damned parents of these little animals, when confronted about what their child was doing, would just acknowledge that their child was wrong and make it clear to them that their behavior is unacceptable.

But that doesn't happen. The parents of these heathens come into a principal's office or confront some other public official, with both barrels blazing, acting is if their child is being framed or something.

I fear that something that was said by one of the parents, who's son committed suicide, said it best: it is going to take the child of someone 'important' or 'famous' to suffer from bullying and possibly take their own life, until something substantial is actually done about this problem.",1368316800,,3075,4.63302752293578
4623419,5,B0059XTUH2,"I watched it with my 13 year old daughter as well. This film reveals what students have to deal with every day because they are perceived to be different. I think the previous generation viewed bullying as a right of passage. Something that you live through. But as this story demonstrates, not everyone lives through it.  Until now, I don't think that any film has demonstrated how pervasive it is for the victim. It isn't one insult that his hurled at them. It's daily beatings and verbal assaults chipping away at the student.  Poor Alex has accepted it as his fate. No one helps him.  A clueless school administrator still tries to make bullies and their victims be ""friends"" instead of protecting her students. And in a vomit inducing scene, she breaks out pictures of her new grandbaby as a demonstration of how she is such a great defender of children. Even my 13 year was angry with how she failed to do anything. The parents are shuffled out of her office without any real help.

4623423,5,B0059XTUH2,"This review does contain spoilers.  I was fortunate enough to obtain a copy of this DVD for review.

Bully is a movie that will bring almost every emotion out within you as it goes over the subject of bullying and tells some victim's stories as well.  When watching this documentary, you will get angry and sad for sure and it just might remind you of your childhood days.

Bully starts out by telling the story of Tyler Long, 17 years old, who was bullied at school so much, it got so bad, that he had killed himself to escape the nightmarish, unbearable days he was living.  You can see the pain and you can feel it yourself when Tyler's parents tell the story of what type of kid he was, his personality, and, eventually, the day they found him dead in his room.  Tyler Long isn't the only story they tell of a bullied teen committing suicide.  We also hear the story of Ty Long, 11 years old, as well.  The movie even goes as far as to show Ty's funeral to tug at the hearts of the viewers even more.  The viewer thinks to himself, how can it so bad to make one commit suicide?  Ty's father made a good point in the film saying if Ty was a politicians child, changes would happen tomorrow; however, I would take that statement even farther and say a politician's child probably would be attending a private school instead of public.

Bully follows a couple of teens around, mainly Alex, 12 years old from Sioux City, Iowa, who comes from a family of five kids.  We see as he's waiting for a bus to come pick him up for school, a young boy threatens to beat him up.  While on the bus, a kid threatens to stab and kill him as well.  Where bullies always this bad?  Threatening to kill someone?  When growing up back in the day, bullies never thought about threatening someone's life like they did in the movie.  Alex just takes the punishments and says he's used to it, but you can tell, from his interviews, that he's got a lot of pain in his heart.  You can hear it in his voice as he talks quietly about the bullies he's had to face on a daily basis.  Alex's parents try to talk to the school administration about the bullies at his school; however, they seem to do nothing as their concerns and pleas fall on deaf ears.  The Assistant Principal claims that the kids are good every time she is around them.  She is clearly oblivious to how kids can act when she is not around.

We also see another victim of bullying in the movie, Kelly, age 16 who lived in Oklahoma and is a lesbian.  She dresses like a boy, acts like a boy, and she used to be a cutter and had tried to commit suicide on at least three different occasions.  She was bullied by both students and teachers because she lives in a small town and they don't agree with her lifestyle.  It got so bad to a point where her parents had to take her out of school.  Kelly now lives in a different town; however, she's still having a hard time getting people to accept her even though she has a small group of friends she hangs out with, which, she claims, helps her live every day.

We then hear the story of another bullied girl, Jameya Jackson, 14 years old, who was an honor student.  She was bullied by 9-10 kids at school and it got so bad that she took a loaded gun to confront her bullies.  We see video footage of the moment she pulled the gun on the bus, which is chilling to see.  No shots were fired, but the situation could have easily been tragic in an instant.  Jameya had spent some time in juvie for the incident.

Devon, age 14, is another child Bully talks to about his experiences being bullied by kids.  Devon claims that he had been bullied at school and he went off on someone and stood up for himself.  He says the bullying stopped after he confronted his bully and put them back in their place.  He has not had a problem with bullying since doing so.

Later in the film, the filmmakers show video footage of Alex being bullied to his parents, who admitted they didn't think it was as bad as it showed in the film.  They then showed the video footage to the school.  After talking to Alex's parents, the Assistant Principal decides to put Alex on a different bus, thinking the bullying would stop.  It turns out, the bullying does continue even when Alex is on the different bus, so that was not a good solution.

Bully is a film that needs to be seen by everyone, parents, students, teachers, advocates, and everyone in between.  This film does a great job capturing the hard times and some punishments that kids go through when being bullied.  The interviews with the victims are great to get a real perspective and the actual scope of the problem.  My overall rating for this film is 5/5 stars.  Although there is no instant solution to the problem of bullying, the least people can do is raise awareness of the problem.  The Bully Project, which was started because of this film, raises awareness and gives people a chance to tell their stories as well.  The website for The Bully Project is a place for information and resources on how you can talk with kids on the issue of bullying.

4623465,4,B0059XTUH2,"I remember two specific cases when I was bullied in school.  The first, I responded with a swift kick to the crotch, the sixth-grade boy ran off wailing and never bothered me again.  The second, I sweetly smiled and replied with a witty, inappropriate comment loud enough for the whole class to hear, the tenth-grade girl pouted and only glared at me the rest of the year.

I was never popular.  I was mostly ignored by the masses.  I had my small group of friends, but I remember feeling like I didn't fit in.

I guess that's my only problem with this movie.  Bullying is a part of life.  You have to learn to stand up for yourself, brush it off and move on.  Every teenager feels awkward and doesn't quite feel like they fit in.  That's part of growing up and discovering yourself.

With that said, I do think this is a movie EVERY parent should watch.  Parents need to band together and teach their kids to stand up for themselves and for others.  More importantly, parents need to teach their kids the golden rule.  I think we have become a very undisciplined society by the looks of this video and it is a shame.

I have personally contacted some schools in my area to speak to kids about Bullying but they told me no because I was not with an organization. I was a bit offended by that.

In the 12 years in the USAF I worked and studied more with marriage and drugs with a TA mythology and did counseling as part of my job and on weekends at the family  clinic. What I got out of this movies and my limited experience was some kids are predestine to develop a victim syndrome. I saw the parents AFRAID to deal with the child at an early and teen age. They need and to aggressively provide support and pursue remedies tailored to their child.

Yeah, this in not a really happy time, although it does have alot of light hearted and funny moments.  There is tragedy here.  Not just kids who have died from being bullied too much, but more (in my perspective) the lack of action from schools, police, etc.  This is a documentary that all parents should watch with their children as it will illicit many questions and discussions.  It really has to be seen, and once seen it will make you want to get involved by going to the website.  I encourage everyone to at least see this movie once.",1367366400,,853,4.565789473684211

4623505,5,B0059XTUH2,"My sentiments on ""Bully"" echo the majority of reviewers here who say that this documentary is a must see for children and adults.  What's perhaps even more shocking than the bullying acts depicted though is the jaw dropping cluelessness of many of the school administrators.  As I was watching this doc, I formed some choice words for the completely inept Vice Principal of the school Alex attended.  The scene where this she-imbecile is talking to Alex's parents in her office and she just suddenly stops listening to their serious problem and starts talking about her own grandchildren out of the blue as if this poor family's problems mean nothing to her was absolutely jaw dropping.  The complete insensitivity to the problem this woman showed (and displayed in other events as well) is completely mind blowing.  I sincerely hope that hopelessly incompetent woman lost her job after this doc came out.  Bullying is a huge problem, myself and my best friend were bullied in school. Like so many of today's kids-I tried to get help and like so many of them my pleas went unheard-simply falling on the deaf ears of administrators who did not care enough to step in and get involved.  I sure hope this documentary opens a few eyes.  It's heartbreaking to watch these kids get repeatedly psychologically damaged on a daily basis.  And that's exactly what bullying is-psychological damage.  We need to get involved and protect our kids.  I am grateful for this inspiring documentary.",1367366400,5,1481,4.931451612903226
4623506,3,B0059XTUH2,"I was really excited about this product - especially when I saw there was a PG-13 version (I believe it originally was tagged with an R rating due to language). I purchased this DVD with the intent of showing it to the students in 5-8th grade at my school to kick of a discussion about bullying. I started watching the opening scenes and was disappointed by the number of ""f-bombs"" dropped by a student on the bus. I had hoped that the PG-13 version would have ""bleeped"" those out. This is an important film and the producer was trying to make it as authentic and real as possible, but I think in the PG-13 version the same message could have been communicated with some minor editing.

If this is what PG-13 allows, I hope they come out with a PG version in the near future. The message from this film is something I want to communicate to the students in my school. The PG-13 version is a great resource that every teacher should see.

Bottom Line: Great resource for teachers, but not something (due to the language in a few parts) I would want my students watching.",1367280000,2,1069,4.4213197969543145

4623508,3,B0059XTUH2,"I think a lot of people are rating this five stars, simply due to it being on the side of antibullying, rather than how good the content of the film actually is and if it actually achieves any of the goals to lessen bullying in schools.  This film simply highlights the plights of a few children who are the victims of bullying, it does portray their hardships well, and you certainly feel sorry for them, especially the kid who is labelled Fishface by his peers, who more than half of the footage revolves around.  But that's pretty much all the film is, besides highlighting a few incompetent people running Fishface's school. It's not really much more than a YouTube video uploaded by some loser filming a student getting harassed or assaulted that goes for an hour and half instead of a minute or so.  Like those YouTube clips it doesn't provide any suggestions on what to do about the problem, we don't even have the camera guy ask the victims what do you think the schools could do that would actually work?  We never interview the bullies themselves after the incidents to get their side of the story, or to ask them why they felt a need to do what they did.

There's areas of the film that have those watching screaming at the screen, in a loud voice the word what?  Such as a sheriff instead of addressing the actual crime of bringing a gun onto a bus to kill a bully or at least let him think that was a possibility. It's never really covered what her plan was.  Instead he decides to charge the girl with the kidnapping of 22 children even though clearly she wasn't going to kidnap anyone, and he then tells the camera she could have got a life sentence for each of those ridiculous charges when later we are told a judge as you would expect threw them out at court.  A principal tells a bully and the victim to shake hands (fair enough) but then is oblivious to the fact the bully is not being sincere and tells off the victim for not wanting to in front of him. Then we have the vice principal, after the violent bus scenes are shown to her with Fishface and his mother in her office, when the frustrated victim of the assault mentions he told her about a prior incident on the bus and she has done nothing, decide to instead of reassuring him well I'm going to do something now. She tells him off with a well has he ever shoved you under that seat again? No he hasn't has he, so you're lying, I did do something didn't I.  That's like saying has he ever stabbed you again with that pen? He used a pencil this time didn't he, well that proves I've done my job doesn't it. At no time does the camera reporter guy ever pull these adults up afterwards and bring those ridiculous comments/actions up for those who said them to explain and justify. Or perhaps he did but they weren't included.

We miss huge opportunities for the film to go in a direction with the gun on the bus girl such as if she had actually shot someone or a few students would we still be looking at her as a victim, or would she in fact be seen in the same villain light as those students who have shot up schools? Fishface's in particular parent's actions are never questioned.  Why do they think forcing him to relive every incident of bullying that happened to him each day will help him?  Why don't they just buy him a bike so he doesn't have to catch the bus for that matter? Why they don't force him to join into some sort of after school/weekend activity sport or hobby wise that he has an interested in, so he learns to interact with people and can find those around his age with a similar interest? Maybe some of the other kids who attend those things go to his school. The serious issue brought up by his little sister that she is already starting to get bullied at school because he isn't standing up for himself and obviously they think she'll be like him is not addressed at all after that.  A gay student tells us a van deliberately ran her over when she was in the middle of the road and this is somehow part of the problem of bullying instead of an attempted murder hate crime? The filmmakers never brought up the fact that when all these incidents occurred none of the other kids spoke up or did anything to stop the assaults or verbal bullying which you'd think this would be the most important message for students watching this DVD after seeing actual incidents of bullying on the screen.

The lack of suggestions on what can schools in general really can do about this issue is what really brings this film down. We aren't shown any footage of successful actions by schools tackling similar incidents shown in the film to learn from them.  Sure at the end the parents of kids who have taken their lives suggest everyone should go up to someone sitting by themselves with no friends and talk to them but that's it.  Nothing is suggested to Fishface or the other victims on what to do to make themselves less of a target or simply how to make friends. What are these victims going to do when school is over and they get a job?  Bullying still occurs in the workplace, especially in entry level jobs, how are they going to make sure they aren't victim's there as well?",1367107200,2,5168,4.355509355509356

In my opinion, everyone should watch it to gain some perspective on just how damaging it can be. Watching these targeted children & their families and friends struggle to cope with the numbing sense of hopelessness instilled by their bullies brought me to tears at times. The incompetent ""solutions"" and hollow excuses provided in response by those who parents trust to protect their children was shockingly inept and infuriating.

Scenes that stood out to me were a town hall meeting with the parents of a child who committed suicide to escape his bullies in which NO invited school officials bothered to show up & the clips of an assistant principal and her breathtaking incompetence in dealing with bullying happening right in front of her.

4623667,5,B0059XTUH2,"I wanted to write this review because I have a totally different opinion than many of the others who have written here.  First I want to say that I have been bullied as a kid, much worse than the gay girl and the girl who pulled a gun.  Kids would spit on me tag me and play the germs game, and would bully anyone who would try to be my friend.  When I was really little, I would cry in front of the whole classroom and then they would do things to make me cry.  As I got older, I started standing up for myself by insulting them back (and I fought dirty because I called fat girls FAT), and they stopped.  They never became my friends but they didn't insult me anymore.  I learned a lot of life lessons by being bullied that I have used as an adult.

I actually think that the only thing that schools should do about bullies is to kick out the most violent kids.  What I mean by this is if a student frequently gets into fights constantly and most of the time it is his fault, he doesn't belong in a regular school.  On the flip side, I think that Alex probably shouldn't go to a public school until he can improve his social skills.  One of the boys who hit Alex said that Alex said something to him first and he was responding to it.  The other students have a right to sit quietly on the bus without being insulted by Alex.  I feel that the boys' reaction was way over the top, but I feel that Alex said or did something to those boys first.

The two girls in the documentary and the two boys who killed themselves, I feel that their parents need to teach them how to cope with unkind people.  The lesbian girl who dresses like a boy and hugs her girlfriend really needs to tone it down a little and respect her classmates who do not accept the gay lifestyle.  If this girl continues this behavior, she will be very limited in her job choices because she makes people uncomfortable by the way she dresses and behaves.  You can't have the attitude that your rights are more important than everyone else's in the workplace; it is no different than a member of the KKK.  They would be told by management to tone it down or get out.  The girl who pulled a gun should learn different ways to cope with unkind people than pulling a gun out.  I work as a telemarketer and before that a customer service rep and if I carried on the way that these girls do everytime someone is rude to me on the phone, I wouldn't be able to last an hour.  Why didn't the two parents of the two boys who killed themselves teach their sons how to cope with mean people instead of expecting the school to do something?

If the school gets involved in every students' conflict, these bullied students will never learn how to handle unkind people and conflict in their lives.  These students may become unemployable in the future because they will expect an authority figure to get involved with every conflict that they have instead of solving it themselves.  The only jobs that they will be able to get are jobs that don't involve the public because they won't be able to handle percieved rudeness or critisim of any kind.",1365552000,,3098,4.258119658119658

4623669,5,B0059XTUH2,"I think this was a great way to bring awareness to schools, parents, and children who take bullying way too lightly. The way kids bully each other nowadays seems to be worse than when I was growing up. It's extremely heartbreaking to see so many children take their lives because they feel they're not strong enough to deal with the pain and/or have no support.

I'd definitely recommend this movie, and I think it should be required viewing in schools.",1365465600,,453,4.6625
4623670,4,B0059XTUH2,"I thought the most compelling parts of this movie were those involving the school administrators reactions, in particular Vice Principal Kim Lockwood's scenes. The shocking scene in which she attempts to force one middle school student who is obviously the victim, to accept the clearly insincere 'apology' and hand-shake from his bully. America has a bullying culture, not just among kids. That being said schools are definitely a good place to start remedying this situation and this documentary shows that changes need to be made in the attitudes of school administrators towards bullying.",1365379200,2,592,5.376344086021505
4623671,2,B0059XTUH2,"Parts seem staged, especially at the beginning and on the bus scenes. Hard to believe kids would act like that while a camera was present. Really does look like kids were instructed to bully the other kids for the camera. That said, I'm sure bullying takes place, I just don't think many of the scenes were of actual bullying but rather a reenactment. The scenes filmed from a distance and those with the incompetent school officials do seem authentic.

The strong emphasis on gay rights is misplaced in this groundbreaking work and will turn away otherwise supportive viewers. The emphasis should have remained squarely on bullying itself, not extensive coverage of the social circle of a lesbian high schooler (she looks like a boy).

Finally, the suggested activism will be ineffective, unfortunately. It will really take a sea change in school policy and what we think schools are for in order to change anything. The ability for kids to go to school not only unmolested, but encouraged, validated, and bolstered is probably far more important than learning the academic material, but currently the emphasis is just the opposite.

The accurate depictions of school officials' lack of action on bullying are excellent. One of the best parts is when the principal is forced to take action on bullying against fish-face. She reluctantly assigns a lower official to conduct an investigation. During the interview with fish-face, the official claims that she takes action against bullying. Fish-face points out that in a previous year that same official didn't do anything about a bully that was bothering him. The official  claims she did do something about it, but apparently she never followed up with the victim, because fish-face points out that the bully kept bothering him. This just goes to show that the minor actions school officials take against bullies are totally ineffective.

Any parent of a victim child or any former bully can tell you that only two things will stop a bully - somebody giving the bully a good whoopin (preferably the victim), or the bully being forced to understand the effect his bullying has on his victims and the atmosphere in the school generally. Just listen to the kid in the movie who was a former bully - he only changed after he began to realize how bad an effect his bullying had on his victims and all the kids in general. Only when society embraces a strong, proven method or two that will stop this threatening behavior, will this problem be solved. And any such method must include either corporal punishment, or an intense program to teach the bully the effects of his behavior, or both.",1365206400,3,2636,4.901345291479821

4623673,5,B0059XTUH2,"This gripping, poignant and impactful documentary begins with the most innocuous of images - young Tyler, playing in his family's backyard. Viewers are swiftly wrenched from this felicitous scene and thrust into the reality of school bullying, which resulted in his tragic and preventable suicide at the tender age of seventeen. Think it can't get any worse? You haven't seen anything yet.

Following the travails and ordeals of several bullied teens and the impact it has on their families. The almost invariably callous denial by school officials is showcased for the world to see. At a press conference, unable to deny the existence of bullying as the scientific consensus is unable to deny the impact of anthropogenic global warming, a principal claims that her school is not a ""haven"" for bullies. It's reminiscent of the Catholic Church standing in adamant denial of the thousands of instances of child rape occurring under their noses and on their watch.

Such willful and deceitful denial flies straight in the face of the evidence provided over the past year, including physical assault and threats. A sliver of merit that came forth from Tyler's suicide came in the form of other children willing to speak up and give a voice to Tyler and other children who were victimised at school. In some cases, children missed two or three days of school a week. Another aspect of denying the problem are the instances of attempted suicide, which are obviously far easier to cover up, especially if the weapon is confiscated by a ""concerned"" authority figure.

The scene where a callous policeman dismisses psychological and emotional bullying as essentially harmless (those opinions are clearly implied in his indifferent attitude) compared to physical bullying is enraging, to say the least. I don't care that she brought a gun on a bus - that was over the top, but so was the way she was treated. Society is doomed to a deadly spiral when heartfelt pleas repeatedly fall on deaf ears. A pastor proselytising the joys in heaven that await all children who perish is no better.

""Suck it up"" has got to be the least effective and most cruel mantras repeated by well-meaning but uneducated adults in this issue. Children cannot stand up for themselves unless they are loved, supported and taught about the importance of self-esteem, their value as a person. Without this vital foundation, it is all too easy for bullying to destroy lives and prevent children from coming anywhere close to their full potential, academically or otherwise.

The most profound statement was uttered by Tyler's mother, and it cleaves right to the heart of the issue. ""It doesn't matter who their parents are. When they're at school, they should be safe. Period!"" Children are our future, and so long as quiet, introverted, gentle children are pushed by the wayside for violent and impulsive bullies to prosper, intimidate and dominate them, the United States will never claw itself out of the cesspool of despair and melancholy that ignorance and complacency has hurled it headlong inside.",1365120000,,3067,5.017681728880157
4623674,4,B0059XTUH2,"I ordered Bully because I am a middle school teacher.  It is a powerful documentary, but should not be used as a stand alone event.  It shows bullying in the extreme.  The bullying we have at our school is the more subtle and covert bullying, so we needed something as a springboard to start the discussion, and that is what this movie did.  Since showing the movie, we have had other speakers and done other activities to get the kids thinking about why bullying occurs and what they can do to take the power from the bullies.  Again, while it is a very powerful movie, it just cannot be used as a stand alone event in a school.  It needs a lot of follow up.",1364860800,,659,4.232
4623715,2,B0059XTUH2,"I gave it 2 stars because the camerawork was high end with all its depth of field shots and still pensive shots, but it didn't seem to have a strong central driving character.

Alex seems to be the main subject, but I don't think there was enough of his story revealed.  Maybe more of his everyday struggles, and how he survived that school at his graduation.  He was a very frail boy and I could see how no matter what school he would go to, or even playing at the park after school, he would be a target.  His father was a clown expecting this weak kid, to take up arms against the bullies so that people would take him and his little sister seriously.  Really, dude?  You send your kid to school to let him fight alone?

The gay chick (why are we even focusing on this minor's fornication?) seemed like she had no real bullying problems like Alex.  Yes, the people are being small-minded in her public school, but her parents could just as easily homeschool her, or put her in good school versus the mediocre one she was in.

The black chick seemed to have the most compelling story, however there wasn't much of it in the film.  I would have liked them to go deeper on her progress especially since they made her a drug slave by putting her in an asylum and giving her drugs all day every day for months.

I wish the movie had more stats about bullying and bullying deaths from around the country and the world.  It seems to be more of a film to rally some young activists looking for something safe to combat or protest but there is not enough substance for my palate.",1364774400,3,1573,4.294915254237288

4623717,5,B0059XTUH2,"We are showing this film to every 9th grader in our school.  Every kid (actually everyone) should see this movie.  I think some kids are starting to tune out the ""anti-bullying message"" with what seems like multiple assemblies every year.  They are becoming numb to the ""lectures"" they hear over and over. However, this film is different because it really depicts bullying on a personal and emotional level that lets you see and feel what the victims and their families deal with everyday.  I do think this film might be a little too intense for middle school students (even though they could probably benefit the most from its message).  A couple of scenes use strong language (including one scene where the F-bomb is dropped a few times) and images of young kids' funerals might be difficult for less mature kids to process.  This film alone isn't going to solve the bullying problem, but it's a step in the right direction.",1364601600,,926,4.75625
4623718,5,B0059XTUH2,"I just begun to watch this movie, I was hesitant because it really hits close to home with me. My son who is 13 and dual diagnosed (HFA among other things) is a person that I fear will be targeted.  He is different and it shows.  I can only hope that the parents in the movie (not done watching yet) really go the extra mile in trying to help their kids.

I ask my son have you or are you being bullied.  Do people do this or that to you.  He says no but still I fear for him.

What amazes me so far about this film is the attitudes of the school personnel.  I wonder what the parents of these children are thinking when they see their kids abusing another.  It is soooo important for parents and schools to really reinforce to kids that it is not ok to abuse someone verbally (mentally destroys the child) and physically.  I wonder if the kids who have done horrendous things in retaliation (to others) were in fact reacting to the bullying that probably was going on. I can only pray for the families in the film and for my son in hopes that he will never experience this type of bullying in his life.  THIS IS A WONDERFUL FILM though realllly sad.

The principal at the one school felt it was more important to attempt to get the boy who is being bullied to try harder to get along with his victimizer.  Why didn't she get the parents together (the bullies parents) bring in the parents of the bullied child.  At least in an attempt for the parents to see what the effects of the bullying was and is doing their child (victimizer and victim) Either the victim takes their own life or threatens others to stop the abuse and the victimize grows up to be a really messed up person (f word up) who will continue to victimize other adults and either - best worst case scenario - continue to abuse and be a lonely adult, victimize someone until some1 takes them out to make them stop, or they wind up in jail - sad to say.  I get real angry and believe that I would walk away from my home (not pay the mortgage)  get a rental that is affordable and take my kid out of school and learn to home school.  I would get my kid counseling and learn some self defense tactics.

When will these parents and school administration learn that school kids are not the same today as it was when we were little.  Rarely did kids come to school and shoot up everyone or kill themselves.  It is a different world today kids are killing kids because they don't have the real maturity to comprehend the severity of their actions or maybe they do.  So many parents aren't talking to their kids in the right way. They think that just because they get good grades, live in a good neighborhood, go to a good school that it equates with good character.  It doesn't.  So many parents think not my kid they are in denial.

The sheriff who arrested/detained the little black girl (hate to bring the ""race card"" up but I will) would he have been so cold hearted if the child had of been white? Don't know but it happens.  Possibly he would have been that way if the child had of been any color.  What if it was his child would he have been so cavalier.  I think not.

Believe it or not I have been bullied and was a bullier at one brief time in my life.  I feel deep shame for that.  I knew better when I was doing it.  Those incidents involving 2 people in my teen years following me in my mind for yeas & I am 51 not.  Recently I was able to apologize to one of the people that I hurt back then.  She claims not to remember (how that is possible is beyond me cuz I was MEAN).  I talk to my kids now about bullying, not to bully others, the different forms it takes.  To tell me when it is happening to them.  I ???? them.  I ask regularly.  I will fight their fight if they can't.

Mob mentally is overwhelming to adults much less kids toward kids.  My son was picked on by his friends (diffrence shows more now that he is a teen b4 that no real problems).  I spoke with all their parents (3) got good feedback from 2.  It stopped.  They (his friends) teased him and called him a snitch.  I told him to tell them ""so what my moms got my back.""

When I was bullied I internalized it and felt realll bad about me.  Today I understand that the bullying I did was only  way to alleviate the pain by making someone else feel worse.  That only made me feel more worse cuz I knew I was wrong.

The one little boy that was Tyler Smalley's friend sounded so mature for his age.  But he was only a child and could only do but so much.",1364428800,,4495,4.129181084198385

4623866,3,B0059XTUH2,"This film is a heartbreaking account of several children who have been tormented by harassment and verbal and physical abuse in school. The most tragic stories are of those youth who were driven to the point where they took their own lives.

I rated this film a three-star because although the anti-bullying rallies and projects are a way to help families heal and bring solidarity to victims, they are mere band-aids on the true causes of bullying: Child maltreatment and confinement.

I have been working with youth of all ages in various roles, including as a mental health counselor, social worker, mentor and educator. I am a homeschooling single mother. Children treat others with violence and hatred when their needs are not met, when they are tormented, abused and neglected at home by their parents and families and when they are forced to attend the prison-like hierarchical environments of factory schooling. The entire power structure of schools, with adults having total power and control over the lives, movement, bodily functions and thoughts of children sets up a dangerous dynamic amongst a group of youth forced to associate in such conditions. Many school teachers are rude, sarcastic, disrespectful, controlling, abusive and use their position to lash out and act out their own personal control issues onto the children. Teachers model bullying by their very position over children.

The entire structure of schooling sets youth up to be powerless and voiceless. Youth lash out against the apathy to their basic needs and against the neglect of their needs for freedom, play, creativity, autonomy and joy by developing a toxic youth culture that adults can't penetrate, despite their attempts, threats and surveillance. Youth in schools set up their own power structures, usually based upon superficial criteria. Youth feel the power and control they lack by segregating into groups and even by targeting and abusing other youth. Rallies, bracelets, slogans, initiatives, curriculum and school talks about bullying are not going to stop this abuse of children because they fail to address the way adults treat children in Industrialized culture.

I also rated this film a three-star because this film ignored the most obvious solution that a growing number of families are joyfully choosing daily: Homeschooling and unschooling! The best way to change a system that refuses to change is to walk away from it. If enough families abandon schools and either homeschool or unschool or begin establishing child-led learning communities right in their towns and cities, the indomitable power structure of schooling would fail.

Parents, your children's lives, your children's mental health, your children's safety are worth more than school. Our society's bizarre, unchallenged belief that school is a necessity and that the absence of school is akin to death is causing death to be the answer for so many suffering youth.

If your child is suffering any form of bullying, remove your child from school and research unschooling TODAY. Do NOT force your child to take the abuse for another day! Would you tolerate what they are forced to tolerate? Protect your child and help him or her restore a healthy sense of self worth, safety and self love by allowing your child to live and learn naturally, as people did for millennia until 1852. Yes, parents with minimal income and full time jobs and single parents CAN do it with sacrifice and creativity! Tap into homeschool groups and community activities. Allow your child to follow his or her passions and interests. Whatever you do, don't keep sending your child back for another dose of torture- You are not aware of their breaking point. As someone who works directly with youth who are victims or bullies (and often both at the same time) and as someone who has personal experience as well, I can tell you, SCHOOL IS NOT WORTH THE DAMAGE IT CAUSES.",1363392000,9,3914,5.098283931357254
4623867,3,B0059XTUH2,"This film didn't particularly move me or blow me away. I didn't find new insights or information. Rather, the film presented stories of a few parents who children took their own lives due to bullying, and a few stories of children who are currently experiencing bullying. The film only briefly showed how school administrators, and board members can be complicit in denying there is bullying or assigning blame to both bully and victim.

I think the film could have done a much better job at addressing what bullying is, what goes on, how responses to bullying are inadequate, and new solutions to bullying. However, what I am most appreciative of is just the simple matter that people are finally talking about bullying as a serious problem and realizing that it's not okay and shouldn't be considered a ""rite of passage.""

4623870,2,B0059XTUH2,"I have mixed feelings about this film and it certainly didn't move me to do anything. All the incidents take place in small town communities. The student base is small and any new kid or different kid gets bullied. In larger schools there are abundant students that there are enough kids that don't fit in, that they can form friendships among themselves.

In this film, all the kids that are bullied are different. They suffer from name calling and being ostracized. In some cases it is physical. The principal of the one school confronts the bullies and threatens to put a note in their permanent record if they don't stop. Now in my school, that wouldn't stop the bully. Indeed, you would have gotten your butt kicked for snitching.

I didn't see anything I didn't see, experience, or even dish out while growing up generations ago. It is ashame that nature has predisposed our species to be like all the other species in separating the weak elements of the pack. But as I see it bullying is like cancer. It is natural. It is easier to prevent than cure. And too many times things don't work out. But has society become bigger bullies than when I was a kid? Or my grandparents? Or is the fact everyone owns a camera and films aspects of our life we wouldn't normally want filmed? There is no mention of the adolescent brain development which leads to undesirable traits.

My heart goes out for these kids, especially Fish Face. Growing up, I would sooner eat poop and get the crap beat out of me than to tell someone it happened. But to capture it on film and then complain to adults? They will all regret they made this stupid film as will everyone else who puts their stupidity on U-Tube for all to see. I would sooner take my chances by giving the bully a swift hard kick to the nads when he didn't expect it.

Because of the topic everyone will ooh and aah over how important it is to see this film. The most powerful and disturbing thing about this film are people who find it powerful and disturbing. It interlaces home movies with shot footage. So if you are a kid getting bullied, what you really need to make yourself fit in is to have a camera man, boom man, director and producer follow you around and film you on the school bus. That will rate a shot to the head. I didn't find it informative or moving. I went to school once myself. It is not just a red state Bible Belt issue like the film seems to imply in one episode. It's life. Deal with it.

4623905,5,B0059XTUH2,"This documentary needs to be seen by anyone who has children or who works with children.  I am neither, but I watched it because of the subject matter.  I was bullied when I was in junior high.  The lesson that I learned then, and that has been reinforced throughout my life, is that the bullying will continue if you don't stand up for yourself.  It's uncomfortable but necessary.

I gave this file 5 stars because of the subject matter.  However, I have issues with the following:

Poor Alex.  His father blames him for his bullying.  His father's only concern was what was going to happen to Alex's younger sister the next year when she gets to junior high?  Is she going to be bullied because Alex was bullied?  He tells Alex to fix it but doesn't tell him how.  Alex is told by all the adults that he has to fix this problem, that the problem is somehow his fault and that he should fix this.  Alex is given no advice because the adults had none.  How can they expect a 12 year old to address this when they don't know what to do themselves?  His father should take Alex to the gym and show him how to throw a punch.  Alex would probably benefit from some sort of counseling or coaching to improve his communication skills.  The vice principal that he met with at the end of the school year was particularly insulting and ineffectual.  I hope she was fired when the film was released.  I don't think it was addressed in the film, but Alex is obviously autistic.  I wish the film maker had addressed this.

I feel for the family of Tyler Long.  Young Tyler committed suicide because of the bullying he endured.  Tyler's story is told largely through his father David's perspective.  David is heartbroken, but he needs to keep moving on because he has two other children to raise.  The administrators at Tyler's school knew what was going on, but no one did anything about it.  Tyler's family didn't know what to do.  Once Tyler died, they turned their sorrow in to activism.  Probably a healthy choice.

There were three or four other stories addressed in a 90 minute film.

I think the film would have been much better if it stuck with the stories of only Alex and Tyler for the first part and then spent some time addressing solutions to the problem.

I give this film five stars because the story needs to be told and two stars on the execution.",1362873600,,2352,4.425233644859813

Please don't take this as an ""holier than thou"" review, as I was also picked on as a child and I also picked on others as a child.  BUT, picking on and ""bullying"" are two different animals.

I actually wanted to reach out and slap that principle that said ""kids will be kids"".  No, kids will not be kids as long as they are allowed to act like animals.

That said, every child from middle school on should be required to watch this movie, and every parent of a child should be required to watch it as well. We can't use the excuse that it's because ""God was removed from the schools."" All of this was going on before that happened - I know because I was there! Some people say ""kids will be kids"" - that's a copout. Kids will be the people WE teach them to be. Other people say ""this isn't bullying; it's violence and harassment."" I'd have to ask those people - what exactly do you think bullying IS?! It's time we stood up for those who for whatever reason can't stand up for themselves, for the kids who've been beaten down so much, who've been let down by the adults who should be looking out for them, that they've gone numb, that they've lost themselves, that they don't know where to turn or who to trust. It is UNACCEPTABLE that young people are taking their own lives because they're being harassed for being ""different."" What IS ""normal""?

4623981,4,B0059XTUH2,"BULLY is a straightforward survey of actual cases of bullying in various public schools across the country. Especially pertinent are the two cases it presents of suicides--one of which involved an 11-year-old boy, Ty Fields-Smalley, in Perkins, Oklahoma--that resulted from antagonism in school. The projects undertaken by the boy's father, Kirk Smalley, are both poignant and practical in illustrating ways to combat this problem. The interviews with the parents of all the 5 or 6 subject-students are similarly valuable.

I was hoping for more cause-effect analysis of the specific reasons WHY bullying takes place; e.g., bullies are often bullied themselves at home or elsewhere. While it's true that many schools could do more to address and prevent the problem, more realistic assessment of the problems schools face would also be helpful. The whole tone of this film suggests that most public schools have the attitude, ""Kids will be kids, and there's not much we can do about that,"" which, as I know from substitute teaching in two different states, is hardly the case. Teachers and administrators are usually outnumbered by students by a ratio of  15:1 or more, and it is indeed hard to have a complete, objective picture of every situation that occurs and where/how it started. Some examination of crowd psychology and how groups of children often gang up on individuals they perceive as different (just as adults often do) would be especially helpful in showing the complexities of this behavior.

This documentary is more than worthwhile for anyone interested in this issue, but it greatly oversimplifies the problem of ""bully""-""victim"" relationships.",1362096000,3,1662,5.287878787878788

What amazed me most was what they were able to capture on film; I imagine it could be worse if the cameras weren't around.

4624007,1,B0059XTUH2,"The documentary should've been looked at, and then, seeing what can and should be done,  the REAL documentary should have begun to be made. There is no ""law"" that can be made to end this. What we have here is proof of several things, the most glaring are the following two, which should have been delved into by the film:
1.
The semi-psychotic Asst. Principals and School Superintendants, all eager to say to bully and victim, ""shake hands, and be friends"" when their refusal-to-see-the-problem actually exacerbates the frustration in the bullied child. In one particular scene, the bullied child shows more insight and intelligence than the Asst Principal, a common occurance in todays schools.
2.
The parental cowardice that hangs like a pall over many of these children's lives is never even looked at. In one instance, the bullied child is subtly judged as inadequate by his own parents, and those same parents make no effort to actually prepare the child to stand up for himself; instead asking almost derisively, ""Do you like to get hit?"" If your kid starts lifting the most simple weights till the muscle ""burns,"" he'll add muscle very quickly. Just doing that can add confidence. Add to that the admonition that you're not made of glass, and maybe the bully can beat you up, but let him know you'll get in your punches too, and they'll stop picking on you. Somehow, this is never even mentioned.

I raised 4 boys. One came to me admitting his fear of a bully. I explained a simple UNPLEASANT truth: ""Cowards die many times before their death; the valiant taste of death but once."" I told my son, ""it's OK to be scared, be aware that your knees are shaking, just curl your fingers into a fist so hard that when your fist starts to hurt so much you cant stand it, and at that point you drive your fist into the other boy's face."" He did exactly that (off school property) and never had another problem.

Yes, it's a wonderful notion that all schoolchildren should rally together and help the bullied. I support that 110%, but the human being has to try to help himself. Whoever said friends and fitting-in is the be-all and end-all of all student life, anyway?  If the child - whether geeky or weak - stands up for himself, those are the cuts and bruises he can feel proud of, and guess what? He won't remain lonely for long...",1361923200,19,2333,4.614457831325301

4624058,5,B0059XTUH2,"The great writer William Styron (Sophie's Choice, Lie Down In Darkness)  said  Depression  was to soft a word, it minimized the true agony of the disease and made it sound trite.

The same thing here with the word ""Bully""  torture would be more appropriate. That said ""Bully"" takes a gut wrenching and heart shattering look into the daily lives of children who face an onslaught of terror every day at school. The documentary is fearless as are the children who willingly participated in showing to the world their greatest source of pain and self shame.

What I found infuriating was the cavalier ""boys will be boys"" attitude that was so prevalent among the teachers, administrators, principles and even the bus drivers who turned a blind eye when a child was being abused. In one horrific scene a young boy is being repeatedly punched, stabbed with pencils, choked, called names and verbally humiliated - all in view of not just the other children but the bus driver who says and does absolutely nothing.

And we see this behavior over and over again throughout the film.

In one case a friendless young boy whose bullying by his tormentors is relentless is told by his father to ""stop being a pussy, to be a man to fight back"" he points to his little sister and says how will you defend her when the kids at school pick on her because you're her brother when you can't even defend yourself""

School officials aren't much better - in yet another extremely disturbing scene a school administrator calls two boys inside who had been fighting. It's clear to anyone with a brain cell still kicking that the boy whose so very glib and all smiles and at her request  immediately puts out his hand to shake and make up with the other child who seems a shaken shell of what he should be.

We of course know this is the bullied child, he's been down this road before with the other child, every day this other boy seeks him out and he tells this woman this but it falls on deaf ears. We see her many times through out the film and like the majority of ""professionals"" whose job is not just to educate our children but to protect them flat out ignore what they see.

Bully definitely asks more questions then offers answers, but it is none the less a wake up call or at least it should be. But then we live in  a world where in an epidemic of Gay youth suicides there's Pope spewing cruel and evil homophobic rhetoric.

""Bullied"" would have been a better title because we never get a glimpse of what makes a kid bully other children. The film never explores for a moment the home lives of abusive kids we only bare witness to the wake of misery they leave behind.

They are phantoms - and they shouldn't be.

I think as a society we're going to have to look at that and look deeply if we're ever going to stop this torment. Because that's where the answers are. Hate is taught and the time is long past to try and undo those lessons.",1361577600,3,2925,4.42910447761194

They don't sugar-coat anything. Some of the footage is raw and disturbing. These kids know that the cameras are there;  they've been recorded since before they were born. They know they are being watched, and they still behave like animals. It makes you really wonder what they do when they know no one is looking.

It is kind of limited in scope. They never interview the bullies, so we never know why they think it's OK to treat other kids that way. It doesn't get much into cyber bullying. All of the stories are from small towns. I don't think they intentionally tried to smear small town America, but having one story from a major metropolitan school system would have been helpful. Where are school administrators who fight bullying? They're certainly not in this film, and after I watched it, I'm convinced they don't even exist.

Alex stands out because they followed him around the most, yet they neglected to mention that he has Asperger Syndrome. With Kelby they mentioned she was gay almost every chance they had, but  Alex's autism was never mentioned.  Autistic people across the spectrum run a very high risk of being bullied, taken advantage of and being victim to criminal activity. Keeping autism cloaked in this movie was a horrendous disservice to Alex and to autistic people everywhere.

Everyone is giving Alex a hard time. The kids literally pummel him with fists and words. The school administrators insist that he must have some part in how the other kids are treating him. He must have done something to provoke them. Even Alex's own parents blame him for not doing something about it, but they never explain WHAT he is supposed to do. Their only concern seems to be that his younger sister not be teased for having him as a brother. Alex is treated as a sub-standard human, as though he is less than anyone else, and it's sickening to watch.

You'll be outraged at the other cases, too. Ja'Meya was bullied so much that she brought a gun on her school bus. The sheriff gets some kind of sick pleasure out of stacking as many felonies onto a bullied black girl as he can. I can only speculate what unspeakable things a man like this does in his patrol car back seat while flashing his emergency lights and watching re-runs of Beretta.

Kids in a mini-van ran over Kelby because she is gay, and they call it bullying.  She's not welcome at church, and her teachers openly participate in the bullying and hate. She wanted to stay and try to make a difference and change the status quo, but even the strongest among us have their limits. After another humiliating incident, Kelby can't take any more, and decides it's time to go to another school.

The film also discusses two boys who were bullied so badly they killed themselves. It's gut-wrenching to watch those parents grieve. The movie tries to end on a hopeful note, but it's really not enough. Letting balloons go into the sky won't stop bullying or cure the incompetence of the adults who are supposed to protect these kids. This movie's website doesn't do much, either. They sell DVDs, ""educator toolkits"" and ask visitors to take pledges against bullying. We are encouraged to throw money at the problem rather than solve it, because it's the American way. Everyone needs to see it, but thanks to the way they're distributing it, not everyone will. The bullied kids not just in this film but everywhere deserve better.",1361059200,57,4119,4.537735849056604

4624113,5,B0059XTUH2,"This movie was just heart-wrenching. As the mother of a 5 year old boy with autism, I am already seeing signs of what is to come for my son and I am terrified. He started Kindergarten this year and he is already telling me about two children in his class who are mean to him on a daily basis. I've talked to his teachers and they are hesitant to single-out the bullies or to even label them as bullies because they are so young. I've tried to be patient and work with the school (it is a private school. But after seeing this, I know I need to take a stand for him right now or he will stop trusting me to help him. And he will stop telling me anything because he will think I won't or can't help him. I was thinking about transferring him to public school. But after seeing how horribly these school administrators handled these situations (making the kids who were bullied feel at fault)I am even more concerned. I will certainly ask for clarity about the school's policies on bullying and specific steps that will be taken if bullying does occur. And, after seeing this movie, I am more strongly considering home-schooling my son. I would prefer it if he were at school and interacting with other children. But if it comes at the expense of his self-esteem and trust in authority figures (including me) it is not worth the price. For some children (like some autistic children), social skills are better learned in baby steps (like frequent, supervised playdates) than in the total immersion of a school environment. I'm glad we live in a time when there is more support and there are more options. But, it seems like we still have a long way to go.

I appreciate the frank and honest look at bullying this film portrays. It was really clear and I feel more aware and able to know what to look for and even steps to take to help my son. My heart goes out to the parents in this film. No one tells you how to handle these kinds of situations and they probably felt paralyzed. From watching this, I see how important it is to be direct and specific in teaching children how to deal with bullying without making them feel like they are in trouble or that the bullying is their fault. They need to know exactly what to do. Role-playing seems like it would be helpful. And I really hope that since this film was released, more is being done to teach achool administrators and staff how to handle these situations and how to distinguish normal childhood conflict from bullying. These schools need specific policies and steps for handling bullying that helps educate the bullied and puts the consequences squarely on the bully. My brother also grew-up being bullied and he was beaten-up on a regular basis. Our parents and the school did nothing. I will not allow that to happen to my child. If he learns nothing else in life, it will be that he is not alone and that I will always fight for him as well as teaching him to stand-up for himself. How else are children supposed to learn how to stand-up when their parents won't do it? The father who lectured his son and told him ""you have to put a stop to this"" sat face-to-face with an administrator who he knew was playing ""politician"" with him and he said nothing. But, he expects his son to be better than him? We have to be the examples and we have to make the tough decisions and stand with our children when no one else will.

The movie tries to leave us with some hope. I think awareness is important. But, more concrete steps need to be taken within the schools to really tackle this problem. I did not finish the movie with a sense of hope. I did have a better sense of awareness of the realities of what goes on, and a more firm sense that I have be strong for my child and willing to do what it takes to protect him. I can not leave that responsibility in the hands of others. It is my job and I have to own it and be willing to fight for him and utilize every option at my disposal to keep him safe.

Sorry for the rant! Thanks for listening! This just kind of poured-out after watching the film. So hopefully you can understand how important it is to see and how much of an impact it will have on people who are affected by bullying.",1360886400,10,4192,4.330788804071247
4624114,5,B0059XTUH2,"I was very eager to get this film and watch it . It was carefully produced and very well done.
It really asks you to look at this pandemic bullying. It does what voices cant it makes you look at what is going on in schools everyday. A situation that has morphed into an extreme form a grotesque torture of our children everyday. When the film visited the parents of children who had committed suicide I broke down. It just makes me so sad that these children were in such a dark place emotionally and that the school district would not take responsibility for not protecting these children. Schools are always screaming that they are De Facto parents while children attend their schools . Alleluia then what happens when our children are bulled? they look the other way and feel no shame for it . There is no other way to tell this story people make light of it and then get perplexed when these children take their own lives because of this relentless bullying . Our society better take a stand as a whole . I was reading a blog another mom wrote about this and she quoted Hillary Clinton, ""It takes a village to raise a child"". I have one better than and its by a prophet who I adore Rev. Martin Luther King ""Never, never be afraid to do what's right, especially if the well-being of a person or animal is at stake. Society's punishments are small compared to the wounds we inflict on our soul when we look the other way."" That said it all as a woman, a mother , and as a human we cant let our children put up with this. Some kids can take it but some cant and there is another beast to tackle the internet which pretty much feels like the whole entire world to a child who is breaking down day by day . This needs to be our first lady, Michele Obama's priority . One child even brought a gun on the bus to protect herself. She spent time in jail a straight A student who could not longer bear the everyday consistent pain of being bullied ,cursed at , taunted and ignored by school officials who just do not want to get involved. I wish this movie could be part of every schools First day making it a pre- requisite to attend every school . But our society is to worried about the rights of the perpetrators and think nothing about the victims. Tyler Long, hung himself in the closet of his room . He is one of the many children who are dead because of bullying. What just happened in Connecticut, scares and has scarred us all. But was the work of someone who was deranged and cut off so emotionally to take the lives of innocent children. Bullies do the same and walk away they destroy a child's life . We have just heard a report from the Harvard School of Medicine stating that bullying changes a child's DNA. I could have told them that without the study as a victim and a fighter my memories of school are sad. If not for wonderful parents and a dad who taught me how to fight I don't know if I could have gotten through it. Being called a spic everyday cursed at and closing the locker on my hands . Until one day I lost it and beat someone to the point of blood curling cries for someone to get me off of her. That was the beginning of my freedom kids were afraid and I kept up the chin brought a heavy linked chain to school and meant it. NO one and I mean No one dared to wake up that devil inside of me again. As my own son was bullied in 4th grade the feeling came back and I went up to the school and fought that fight . I realized it was not worth it and pulled him out and put him in a private school were he is adored . I thank God everyday for that decision . And for the job I have to make it happen . Life does not have to be that hard for an innocent child cant we all stand together and make life wonderful for them all?. I pray everyday that all our villages start to take Hillary to heart like her or not and my beloved Doctor King,always stand up for what is right you would want someone to do the same.",1360886400,15,3930,4.118489583333333
4624125,5,B0059XTUH2,"This shocking and painful documentary exposes the misery several middle-schoolers endure daily at the hands of their bullies.  We also see bereaved parents whose children couldn't take the abuse anymore and ended their lives.  It's an intense film and one that calls for action.

I sobbed throughout the film; the tormented children are so innocent and helpless. I was angry at the ""Everything's fine"" attitude of the school officials whose refusal to help hurts the children just as much as the bullies.  My one complaint with the movie is that, while it calls for awareness and action, it's preaching to the choir; at no time are the bullies, their parents, or the neglectful school staff punished. The extras show anti-bullying rallies, but none of the actual bullies attend them.  I wanted justice!

This is a very important film that will open many eyes to the pain of bullying; I'm not sure any of offenders will see it or the error of their ways, unfortunately.",1360886400,7,968,4.871951219512195

there aren't any other languages avail, so it wasn't dubbed. the movie looks great on bluray, or rather the documentary looks great, because thats what this is, not a movie.
the special features were pretty awesome. i haven't looked thru them all, but there are deleted scenes, life after bully for the main star of this documentary, which was pretty much alex. some informative info on how to bully proof your school, the good morning america segment with the families in the movie was include, which was about almost 8 min, alex, his mom, the director and mr long who lost his son to suicide. very nice extras.
you'll probably will notice how some of the extras how some video issues, its because they weren't shot in 1080p and were badly upscaled lol, but thats ok. so you'll see some video artifacts, but nothing too major that will interrupt the features.

4624129,5,B0059XTUH2,"As far as documentaries go, this is probably one of the most important contemporary ones out there -- especially if you're a parent or soon-to-be parent. Most would say that bullying (whether being bullied or being the bully) when you're a kid is ""just a part of growing up"" or that ""it builds character."" I find that those who say that were either never bullied growing up or they were the bully. And so does director Lee Hirsch, who was bullied as a kid. Someone once said, ""The side that bullies soon forgets, but the side which is bullied will never forget."" And truer words have never been spoken. Especially in a scene where boy #1 (who was just bullied by boy #2) is pulled over by an assistant principal and she forces boy #1 and boy #2 to shake hands, thinking that will absolve the physical altercation that had just occurred; when boy #1 (who is fed up) won't ""sincerely"" shake the hand of the boy who was just pounding on him, the principal scolds the bullied boy #1! Frustrating and angering. Fortunately, this film did accomplish what it set out to do: zero-tolerance policies toward bullying have been taken by most of America's schools and there is more understanding and empathy toward a child when he/she says they are being bullied. The segments in this film are powerful and some of the blind-eye action that is going on within school administration, stating that ""everything is fine"" when video proof shows otherwise, is appalling.

4624131,5,B0059XTUH2,"I made my husband drive 60 miles with me to see this movie last year. I am a special education teacher, high school level, who sees first hand how cruel kids can be. I experienced bullying in junior high school at the hands of the most popular girl in school,among others, and still feel the effects of it 40 years later. This movie shows everyone who was never a victim exactly what the horrors of bullying are. It also demonstrates how poorly trained most administrators and staff at school are. They may be good intentioned, but do not have a clue as to what really goes on, and what works to handle the situation.
Parents will benefit because it can help them to identify the signs that their child is, indeed, a victim of bullying. It is also a step in the right direction in bringing the facts that LGBT(or those conceived to be) students are much more likely to be bullied than their peers, without being in your face on that issue. I cried, wanted to hug the victims and their families, and step in and intervene differently than the school officials, yet realized that most school districts do not have training or policy in place.
This is just one of many contributing factors to violence and unequal balance of power in our country. It starts at a young age.",1360713600,5,1269,4.4978354978354975
4624132,4,B0059XTUH2,"UPDATE: I was aware of the fact that the original film did receive a ""slight"" edit to receive a PG-13 rating, however, I was unaware of the specific edits as I couldn't find an article detailing what they were. (There were a LOT of articles about the rating of this film as it was a big deal last year and received major media attention.) Thanks to the update by Brian Holst in the comments, the ""slight"" edit is apparently the bleeping of three of the film's six F-bombs, and that's it. The key scene where a girl is harassed on a bus was the major center of the MPAA controversy, and that scene is left completely intact.

I believe that ""PG-13 Version"" is printed on the cover because the film makers want to make sure parents know about the rating and don't avoid renting or buying the disc.

I still give 4 instead of 5 stars over a very stupid, pointless, and silly edit having to be made to the film over mostly political reasons.

For people all over the world who fall into one of these three categories (which pretty much covers everyone), this is the must see film of 2013.  Bullying has come to the forefront of mainstream society here of late, even though it has been around for many many years.  The difficulty, the pain, the frustration, the emotion is covered very well in this film.  I was bullied as a child, so it was like seeing my story on the big screen.  I was thoroughly impressed in that both sides were shown.  There were children, parents, and educators all interviewed, which helped to show the perspective and complexity of this issue.  Did it make me angry, yes.  Did it get me depressed, yes.  Did it make me cry, yes.  But more importantly, did it open my eyes or make we want to get involved, it certainly did.  The only way to stop bullying is through education about the problem, and I think this is a HUGE step towards that goal.",1359590400,,1101,4.417910447761194
4624134,5,B0059XTUH2,"BULLY is a powerful, disturbing documentary feature from director Lee Hirsch that sparked a national movement that rallied people to stand up to school bullying, hate and intolerance.

This is a difficult film to watch, as the camera captures the emotionally painful lives of five families whose children were victims of school bullying.  Two of the kids committed suicide, while another in a desperate effort to get her fellow students to leave her alone, threatened then with a gun and wound up in jail.

However, what is truly distressing about BULLY is the ""kids will be kids"" and ""there's not really much that we can do"" attitude of the idiotic school administrators and local police who seem to prefer to ignore the issue.

Perhaps if officials like these had addressed the bullying problems in their school, a tragedy like Columbine would not have occurred.

BULLY is not ""entertainment,"" but it is a film that every kid, parent and school official should watch.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains many deleted scenes, featurettes and other extras.
