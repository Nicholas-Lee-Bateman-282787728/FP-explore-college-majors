7223194,3,B00YOJID8E,"This is historical fiction told during the backdrop of the BP oil spill. The theme of the film is about how corporate money dominates politics and policies. Peter Fonda who plays the father of the main character seems to pick and chose films with a message in his autumn years.

Colin Pryce (Nicolas Cage) is a Louisiana representative who gives a passionate speech about the spill and becomes a politician being whispered about for a senate seat. Pryce sincerely wants to help the people in his district and believes oil is old technology. Soon after he rejects a BP offer, his name is associated with a sex scandal. The film labors on and on. Pryce is a jogger, which ties into the poorly developed title, i.e. someone who runs for office and from his past.

Connie Nielsen who played Deborah Pryce did an excellent job as the woman behind the man, who is also an attorney, i.e. she doesn't bake cookies. Cage gives us a Cage performance for better or worse. The problem with the film is that it shows corporate influence as being something secret, when in fact Americans see it happen openly with most not caring who buys politicians.

Recap: A laborious plot to achieve a weak theme with Nicolas Cage.

7223203,3,B00YOJID8E,"Slowly recovering from 'Hurricane Katrina' the 'Louisiana' coastline suffers a further disaster in the shape of
the B.P Oil-Spill which not only threatens the environment but the livelyhood of thousands that rely upon the
Sea to earn a living.......... Congressman 'Colin Pryce' (Nicolas Cage) steps up to Champion their cause, demanding
that the Government ensure that B.P looks after those that have suffered as a result of the 'Spill'
However 'Colin's' Political-Future and indeed credibility are thrown into question when his indiscretions are exposed
by the 'media'
Can he survive the onslaught from the 'Press' and 'T.V Networks' and hang-on to his Political-Career and indeed his
marriage to 'Deborah' (Connie Nielsen) or his credibility with those he genuinely has sought to help following the B.P
Oil-Spill...........Have events simply slid from his control ??
'Nicolas Cage' has been involved in quite a number of below-par movies in recent times, though this perhaps doesn't
really demand him to perform at the top of his game (as we have seen in years past) it is a credible performance from
him, as he grapples to hold things together in the role of 'Colin Pryce'
Another film worth catching up with on the movie-channel sometime.

7223218,1,B00YOJID8E,Third rate political drama. The writing was embarrassing and the direction inept . Not sure how someone like Austin Stark gets a film made today. Maybe his family has money.

7223222,4,B00YOJID8E,"A film that definitely should be considered, along with The Frozen Ground and Joe, as a pretty good addition to Nicolas Cage's filmography as he goes into the straight to dvd/vod portion of his career. The Runner is a surprisingly good movie about a Louisiana Congressman, while trying to help his community in the wake of the BP oil spill, has his career derailed because of a sex scandal and tries to redeem himself in the eyes of the people he feels he let down.

Movie provides a really interesting, sobering look at politics and just exactly who the power players are how they make things happen. How they can create and takedown superstars as they please and how easily politicians can be bought by various industries. In addition to a great performance by Cage, there are great performances by Peter Fonda, Connie Nielson, Sarah Paulson and Wendell Pierce in smaller roles. Only downfall of the movie is its short running time. Movie is about 85 minutes long before the credits start and just when the movie feels like its really heating up it ends. Felt like the movie had another half hour of story in it easily.

Watch it. For a $3.99 rental on Amazon Instant Demand you can't beat it really.",1440806400,4,1202,4.63849765258216
7223223,1,B00YOJID8E,"This movie really was terrible.  I mean awful, Cage has hit an all time low.  The acting was lousy, the writing was even worse.  Don't waste your time on this.  Not even a rental from the box.  Fair warning.",1440460800,,207,4.205128205128205
7223224,3,B00YOJID8E,"Nicholas Cage is a good actor for this role.  It is a film based on politics and moral choices.  Cage convincingly portrays a politician who wants to make the correct decisions for the people who voted for him, but ultimately decides to sacrifices them, to save himself from his own morally bad choices, showing how closely tied a politicians personal choices and political decisions can .be.  And how other people can manipulate politics behind the scenes without the public even knowing about it.",1440374400,4,498,4.975903614457831
7223225,4,B00YOJID8E,"Great men, men who build legacies, they aren't always decent. After giving an impassioned speech talking about the effects of the BP oil spill in Louisiana Congressman Colin Price (Cage) is poised to make a run for the Senate. When a scandal is revealed his career is over. Now, after losing everything he has to chose between wanting to make a real difference, or becoming like every other politician. I don't think I even need to state this anymore but I am not a Nicolas Cage fan at all. There have been a few of his movies I liked (National Treasure, Rock) but not because of him, it was the idea and actual movie I liked. This movie falls under that category. It may have been because of the political aspect but this was very interesting to me and watching a politician build himself back up is inspiring, especially when it is someone who is really trying to make a positive change. Not many of those in real life. Overall, a really good movie that Cage didn't screw up with his acting. His best in a while. I give it a B+.",1440374400,6,1030,4.369791666666667

7223228,5,B00YOJID8E,"This excellent movie had all the elements necessary to make it a Cage classic. It takes place in Louisiana, where the tax credits ensure that the film never loses money. The Runner is a direct-to-Redbox thriller starring actors last seen in the 1990s.

Cage plays a person who is trying to get away from his old life, but gets sucked in by unexpected danger. Instead of a being retired car thief, con artist, hit man, or former human, he's a politician. Very original.

Not to be disappointed, Cage has his signature freak out moment in the film, where his eyes get really large and he says something very loudly that makes no sense. Sadly, there were no bees to torment him in this film.

The basic plot of this movie is simple. Cage escapes from Hell to steal the Declaration of Independence to prove that his daughter is innocent of boosting 50 cars in three nights. All while the world is about to end due to a giant meteor as predicted in the Book of Revelations by a Thai sorcerer. It turns out the entire movie was a vision Cage had the night before while dreaming of a life he let slip away in pursuit of his career.

This movie is Cagediculous. If you buy the Blue Ray Combo, you receive a free copy of the Magna Carta.",1439856000,2,1228,4.37280701754386

7223231,4,B00YOJID8E,"There has been some very harsh criticism of this film even with N. Cages outstanding performance. Unlike many I did not find this story too slow or boring or ""staid"", nor do I see this as a redemption story unless you consider selling out your most important ideals as 'redemptive'. Instead this is an emotionally complex story about a man who has every intention of doing the right thing, someone who wants to rise to the occasion but find the forces of power around him unwilling to give him sway in the direction he wants to go. This character is an alcoholic, needy for love and public acceptance. He faces political scandal, a rocky marriage and is burdened with the needs of some 500,000 powerless people who need him to fight on their behalf.

The message of this film is disturbing but honest; the money bags are in control of our lives and our democracy, they can back a man with good intentions back into a corner until he gives in. The journalist Chris Hedges often says that in order to make real change in society one must stay outside of the corridors of power and this film is a testament to that. What's worse is that if this character had refused to compromise he would not be able to make the changes he aspired towards. This is a politically pessimistic film that doesn't have a happy ending, love does not conquer all and good will very often loses to the interests of those in power. This is a film about America and what she's become (used and abused while its good citizens watch in frightened dismay).",1439424000,17,1525,4.505415162454874
7223232,3,B00YOJID8E,"In THE RUNNER, Nicolas Cage plays an idealistic Louisiana congressman who, because of his tireless work to help the victims of the 2010 BP oil disaster, finds himself positioned as the logical candidate to run for the United States Senate.  That course is, unfortunately, derailed when a sex scandal surfaces, which not only costs Cage his marriage, but also forces him to resign his congressional seat.

Months later, though hes lost all his political friends, attorney Cage is still working on a pro bono basis to help the victims of the oil spill.  Suddenly, an opportunity presents itself for him to regain his previous stature and, once again, run for the Senate.  However, if he does moves forward, it will cost him his political principles.

Although the press releases for THE RUNNER labels it a heart-pounding political thriller, the movie is anything but that.  It is, in fact, the story of a great man who falls from grace and then seeks redemption.

Cage and the rest of the cast, which includes Sarah Paulson, Connie Nielsen, Wendell Pierce and Peter Fonda, acquit themselves well, yet writer-director Austin Starks film is slowly paced and, frankly, its difficult to really care about any of the characters, none of which are very likable.

Cinematographer Elliot Davis has captured some stunning vistas of New Orleans and the Louisiana coast.

THE RUNNER is being released onto Blu-ray by Alchemy.
