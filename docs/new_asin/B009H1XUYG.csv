Stone Age cavemen painted explicit pictures of themselves and their partners in various ""compromising positions"" on the walls of caves 30,000 years ago. The Greeks and Romans were noted for the detailed graffiti (from whence the word comes) that they drew on the walls of their bathhouses. During the Civil War, sutlers made small fortunes providing soldiers with stereopticon slides of young Victorian women in various states of lingerie dress and undress. Although the slides seem laughable today, in the 1860s they were considered the height of depravity.

When the moving picture camera was invented in the 1880s, filmmakers immediately began shooting prurient nude scenes for underground distribution. These films were, as a rule, badly-lit and otherwise poorly made, but a few classics remain, such as ""Le Coucher de la Marie"", made in 1896. Even as mainstream film evolved and technology improved, adult films lagged badly behind. They could be purchased from the back pages of cheap limited-distribution men's magazines to be viewed at home or seen at ""peep shows"" in the red light districts of towns. And though cameras improved and film stocks improved and production standards rose, ""dirty"" films remained singularly seedy in execution into the late 1960s.

Things began to change with the release of a Swedish film, ""I Am Curious (Yellow)"" in 1967, now considered the first film of ""The Golden Age of Porn."" Soon after its release, Denmark abolished all its censorship laws and the United States Supreme Court determined that whether a film ranked as ""pornography"" was a matter of local standards. As a result, cities such as New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles became major markets for adult films, and adult movie houses burgeoned. In just a few years, movies such as ""Deep Throat,"" ""Behind The Green Door,"" ""Inside Misty Beethoven"", and ""Emmanuelle"" were becoming acceptable topics for cocktail party chat.

The invention of home video (first Betamax, then VHS, and then DVD/Blu-Ray) caused an explosion of available porn. The era of home video porn is often referred to as ""The Silver Age of Porn.""  The Silver Age was remarkable for its increasingly high and increasingly mainstream production values. It is still little-known, but Walt Disney Studios, suffering through a disastrous series of flops in the 1970s and early 1980s was very surreptitiously bankrolling much of the porn being made in the Silver Age, keeping itself afloat until it began to produce quality family fare again, like ""The Lion King.""

""Little Girls Blue"" is one of the more memorable offerings of this era. It is a well-produced, well-written, well-acted story about the sexual awakening of young women at a prestigious girls' academy, and like most Silver Age porn it is remarkable for a good script, real plot, more-than-acceptable acting, and explicit sex scenes that are truly erotic. The young actresses are pretty, and most of them play innocent in a very convincing way. ""Little Girls Blue"" is considered a benchmark in adult film production.

It's well worth the purchase, especially if you're tired of ""clips"" and ""scenes"" and ""cammodels"" who turn out sexual product on an assembly line basis. Take a chance, and see what adult films should be like.",1526515200,,3319,5.137037037037037
