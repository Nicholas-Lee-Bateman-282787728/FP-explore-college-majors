431842,5,6302089913,this is a great movie and as a fan of vincent Price I highly recommend this film.  in this movie price plays a magician who with his wife runs a white slavery ring,1354147200,2,163,3.9393939393939394
431843,3,6302089913,"Vincent Price plays a hypnotist/ nightclub magician in this fairly odd campy film. Price is hired by some very rich and powerful white slave traders that wan't young, beautiful white women to be hypnotized so they can then work as slaves at the house of 1000 dolls. There is also a vacationing couple that do the detective work in the movie by tracking down one of their friends missing girlfriends that was kidnapped by the slavers. I feel that Vicent Price does a good job, but he's kinda outta place in this one.",1346025600,7,515,4.548387096774194

431845,3,6302089913,"The movie itself is an excellent movie if you are keen on this genre of movie.
My main complaint is with the VHS version which omits some of the original movie.  Having seen a more complete version on TV this is a big disappointment.
One of my favourite scenes is a victim of this cut.
Although I would recommend the movie, I would not recommend purchase of the VHS product. Hopefully, a full version release on DVD may one day occur.",1287532800,6,434,4.3580246913580245
431846,2,6302089913,"I bought this movie because I like Vincent Price. This is not a Vincent Price movie, it is a movie that Vincent Price is in, when we are lucky. He is not the star. His scenes are few & far between. I finally stopped watching it because it is really dump & I got tired of waiting to see Mr. Price.",1246752000,3,296,3.8688524590163933
431847,4,6302089913,"in this film, Vincent Price plays a magician named Felix Manderville who uses his magic act as a cover for his side-job: abducting women and taking them to a brothel. the men who frequent the place in Tangiers get little dolls as tokens, sort of like a free pass to enter. a cop's friend turns up dead and he's on the lookout for anything strange. Manderville is actually harmless, his wife and the head of the brothel are the ones to be on the lookout for! scantily clad women abound in this drive-in flick. an x-rated version was ALSO filmed at the same time {different castmembers of course!}. i give the film 4 stars because i didn't like the attitude of the cop from America who seemed to think he owned the country simply because he was a cop. Vincent is great throughout. one of the memorable scenes is the mud-fights between the local women.",1079136000,16,849,4.483870967741935

7821858,5,6302089913,"House Of 1,000 Dolls was released in 1968. A eurotrash campy film with George Nader looking for his wife in Tangier who has been kidnapped by a white slavers ring. Martha Hyer gives good support. Fans of george Nader will like this the most.",1465257600,3,241,4.5

7821860,5,6302089913,"Everyone knows the what the movie is about, so I'm not going to talk about that. What I am going to talk about is the audio.

In almost every scene, where there is a car running, it sounds like a jet plane is making the sound. I have a dedicated home theater and this is one of the worst sounding BDs I've purchased. BD displayed through a Epson 9500 UB PJ, 110"" 16x9 JKP Affinity Screen, Definitive (towers/center/rears), Earthquake P12 Sub, Panny BD player and Onkyo 608 Receiver. All ISfed and professionally audio calibrated.

It could be in the original film or Kino Lorber did a lousy job in putting this onto BD. I can't believe someone didn't listen to this before they released it.",1450051200,,690,4.512
7821861,1,6302089913,"A movie with Vincent Price couldn't be all bad could it? Sadly the answer is yes it can. A white slaving ring has Vinnie and his wife in its clutches and George Nader is around to ferret out the bad guys. With such a title you'd think there would be a bit of exploitable fun but this house is as thrilling as shag carpeting. European locations can't save this one from being a house of 1,000 snores. The commentary is informational but that isn't enough to part you from your cash. If you must see it, rent it. And be ready for a 96 minute nap.",1441756800,,544,4.1415094339622645
7821862,5,6302089913,"I am just reviewing the movie not the DVD version. I used to own a VHS copy of this movie. I watched it over and over. I've seen tons of Vincent Price movies. I just wanted to make that clear that I am a Vincent Price fan. Honestly if Vincent Price wasn't the star I would not have watched this movie. It's the type of movie I'm not normally interested in. But if Vincent Price is in a movie I will watch it at least once. My goal is to see and own all of his movies. So if your like me and you are a die hard Vincent Price fan you need to see this movie.

I am honestly surprised Vincent Price made this movie. His specialty was horror. Usually the type of character he played is mentally loosing his mind or has lost his mind. Which is honestly why I think he's called the Master Of Horror. His characters are usually psychotic. He always does an excellent job in making you think he's crazy.

In my opinion his character in this movie was not really psychotic. It also wasn't at all scary. That did disappoint me that this movie is not a typical Vincent Price film.

*Spoiler*
I did find it entertaining as women disappeared and trying to learn who the King Of Hearts is. I will say it was a surprise when I learned who the King Of Hearts is.

*Spoiler*
If you can't stand violence like women being beaten this movie may not be for you. There is very graphic violence towards a women. So you mind find it disturbing to see this movie.

I personally loved the movie. It was very entertaining. I love the song at the end. It's been over 15 years since I've seen this movie but I remember loving the song at the end. I think this movie was perfect from beginning to the end.",1430870400,3,1674,4.154320987654321
7821863,4,6302089913,"Filmed in Germany the film has three established American stars.  George Nader is highly effective as the doctor searching for his kidnapped wife.
Martha Hyer is convincing as a magician's assistant and former lover while Vincent Price is sinister and calculating as the Magician who makes
young, pretty women suddenly disappear!  The title derives from a bordello wherein the kidnap victims are forced to assume a life of shame as
so-called ""companions"" to gentleman customers of the night.  Not really that sordid; rather more of an adventure to rescue women in plight.  The
production values are reasonably good and the location shooting adds realism and serves to some degree, as a travelogue within parts of Europe.
Filmed in color to accent the locales.  Satisfactory on all levels.",1426204800,5,788,5.173228346456693
7821864,5,6302089913,"Vincent Price known for horror is still great in this movie that was made outside the US but produced by API who made many of Price's
horror movies. This is a gem if your a Price fan. He plays a magician who's involved in a girl smuggling ring with the King of Hearts as
the secret leader. George Nader is the 'hero' who is looking for his friend's killer and stumbles on to the smuggling ring. The movie has
foreign actors and the movie was shot in Spain which give it that 'spaghetti western' look and feel even though it's not a western. I read
Price never saw the movie but him and co star Martha Hyer found out later they reshot some of the scenes to make it a porno movie!
But whoever finished the movie I think did a great job and it's a good mystery thriller and the ending is especially good. A must SEE!",1422057600,,813,4.151898734177215
7821865,2,6302089913,"This teasingly salacious story is actually quite dull!  Plodding story of an organization kidnapping young women and selling them as slaves. Very few scenes of the girls being kidnapped or of any real action. I'm a big Vincent Price fan but this is one of his lesser movies!
 Sold my dvd.",1390953600,,288,4.627450980392157
7821866,5,6302089913,The movie was a nice movie with a good amount of action.  Would recommend this movie to customers who like suspense movies.,1354924800,2,123,4.590909090909091
