3448064,3,B001AHPB2Y,"In reading the fine print, this set is made by amazon, not discovery channel. But....
If you don't mind not having menus and chapters, then this dvd set is fine.
It seems they just recorded it off TV. Video quality is pretty good, but the sound is off a bit.
Otherwise, its a good buy.",1219708800,14,285,4.2

3448070,5,B001AHPB2Y,"THE BEST survival show ever made. Les Stroud, AKA Survivor Man is the real deal. The only survivalist, bushmaster, bush crafter, outdoor guy what ever you wanna call it, that ever did it FOR REAL. Unlike all the rest of them fakes, Survivor Man doesn't use a camera crew, takes minimum gear and just sets out to explore the unknown. Along the way he teaches you valuable, practical, real world lessons on how to survive in a multitude of different environments and situations. Best show every made on this subject. Watch it and learn. Stay Alive.",1482537600,2,546,4.697916666666667

3448083,5,B001AHPB2Y,Les always makes good stuff. I have watched every episode of Survivorman what feels like a million times and I enjoy every viewing.

3448086,5,B001AHPB2Y,"SurvivorMan is the real world experience of Les Stroud recorded in seamless documentary form, and delivered to a public. It is not one of those reality TV shows that suffers from poor writers, and non- actors playing their roles in the lowest common denominator fashion that has become so popular on network TV. If you, yourself become stranded or lost, find yourself in a survival situation, and are suddenly thrust into a world that seems to have turned upside down on you, you most certainly will not be accompanied by a full camera crew, light and sound company, or prop managers. No one is going to yell cut, hand you a bottle of water and direct you to craft services for a hearty plate of food. That is the world of entertainment.

Les Stroud as SurvivorMan knows the reality of surviving in the woods. He has been actually living his backwoods survival life style over the years and although he emerges into the modern world in between, he understands what anyone lost in the wilderness is likely to face. That is the man you want to learn from. That too is why he spends time on his shows teaching those of us who romanticize about the surviving in the wilderness from the comfort of our cozy homes with hints, tricks, and tips that might one day make a real difference in real survival situations.

He is a showman, and he travels to exotic, out of the way places to ply his trade. But he also learns and integrates his new knowledge of each location into the show as he demonstrates each step of the way, how he, himself, is coping with the new environments and strives to survive. He does not hide the reality of what lack of food and water and the sheer psychological shock can do to any of us, even those who are strongminded and fit. Occasionally he will also carry with him survival items that are common and available for purchase to give us an on screen trial and review of how they perform but the impact simple tools or other items can have on someone when demoralized by simply struggling to survive. He also plans for each environment and utilizes items that might be commonly found by a survivor. His mastery of his field comes through as he shares some of the simple techniques he has learned, but seldom does he display the more difficult tasks that require years of practice to master. Showman or no, he keeps his audience in mind, and is always working to teach, entertain, and simply allow the watcher to experience that world as he does.

As you might have picked up, I am a fan of Les Stroud. But I know the likelihood of my being stranded is reasonably small. Disaster is always a theoretical threat until it comes to you though. I like being prepared for possible events however, and not only does Les Stroud take you into the wilderness but he also has solid and practical advice that you can use in any unforeseen emergency. If you become more than a passive participant in the show, thinking how to apply his wisdom in situations that you are likely to face can make your life and that of your family better if bad things do happen.",1460678400,,3067,4.492831541218638
3448087,5,B001AHPB2Y,"Great...If you like Les and not Bear....or if you like both. When there is nothiong else to watch, just throw Les in.",1459468800,,117,4.363636363636363

3448099,5,B001AHPB2Y,"I'm a big fan of Survivorman. This guy really puts himself out there. I've seen one or two where he is forced to ditch out before his week is up, but it's only when his life is in danger. This show is educational, informative, entertaining. He does make mistakes now and then, which makes it, and him, even more real. Forget about ""Survivor"", Survivorman is more real than any ""reality"" show.",1434672000,,392,4.535211267605634

3448112,5,B001AHPB2Y,"Ya gotta love Les Stroud.  Let's face it, we all occasionally daydream about the zombie apocalypse or the chance of crashing thru the ice in our cars.  Stroud shows us how a solitary individual in an impossible situation can rally with the materials at hand in order to survive the elements and make it back to safety and does it without a film crew.

Worth getting both season 1 and season 2.",1408579200,,393,4.430555555555555

3448115,2,B001AHPB2Y,"More of the same, but frankly while watching these we'd start each one wondering, ""So, think he'll give up this one?"" as what frequently happens is that Les can't find water and gives up, or there are weather issues so they have to give up, etc.  Seems like a little better planning or direction and they wouldn't have to do it, but it doesn't seem like he's making much of an effort to ""survive"" when he can just toss in the towel whenever he wants.  Yeah yeah, it's more than I could do, sure, but the edge is gone knowing that the challenge can be dropped at any point for whatever reason.",1404691200,,592,4.276785714285714
3448116,2,B001AHPB2Y,In my opinion is not much of a survivor. If you follow what he shows ya your biggest concern is bed sores on your butt!,1401148800,,119,3.8

3448123,5,B001AHPB2Y,I enjoy all survival shows and prepper shows as well as books. The knowledge you gain from them is priceless just as long as you actually do what you see on TV or read in a book. You learn a lot more by experiencing it yourself.,1391299200,,228,3.9782608695652173

3448128,5,B001AHPB2Y,"Not to say that I don't appreciate the entertainment value that Bear Grylls brings, but Les Stroud is truly surviving.  I love the fact that he brings all his own camera gear by himself into the field.  The production quality suffers some (as you would assume with one man operating multiple cameras while surviving) but the impressive survival skills make up for that.  Plus its in HD.",1382659200,,386,4.731343283582089

I scored the whole 3 seasons set (individually) for ~$35 total, compared to about $70 on Discovery's website...and these are the real discs not copies like some have said other Amazon sellers are listing.  I LOVE how Season 3 was made with the ""Play All"" feature that the other two seasons' disc menus don't have.

3448150,5,B001AHPB2Y,"Les Stroud is the real thing.  Unlike the other guys on TV, Les does it all without a camera crew and a safety net.  He doesn't take stupid risks and treats everything as if it is real, because it is.

Survivorman is a very entertaining show with Les providing the voice over filling in the blank areas he may leave out when his is in the ""woods"" because he is too busy surviving.  It is funny watching him get mad at his camera equipment or breaking out his harmonica and jam.

When killing an animal Les explains that this should only be done when survival is at stake. He shows a respect for dangers of the wilderness that everyone should have.  In this season we actually see Les on the run from some of these dangers.

Season 2 shows exotic locations and a sense of maturity that comes from having done this a few time before.  Like Season 1, Season 2 is worth the money.",1335484800,,876,4.266666666666667

I hike in the mountains for days, with a 40+ pound pack, and plenty of creature comforts. He does this without any food or shelter, while carrying masses of camera gear and filming himself solo.

3448161,5,B001AHPB2Y,"Survivorman is an interesting show because it allows the viewer to step out of his/her normal civilized life and live vicariously through Les Stroud. You get to see the few parts of our world that are still fairly untouched and pristine, and perhaps ask yourself how you would survive.

I particularly enjoyed the behind the scenes portion of the DVD, because it showed how Les did his homework on every location, meeting with locals, studying with experts in the field, and getting everything in order for the big week on his own.

Highly recommended!",1240099200,6,552,4.861702127659575

3448164,5,B001AHPB2Y,"Survivorman season two continues Les Stroud's solo excursions in week long, low calorie endurance and extreme weather survival. The format is the same as season one. He's alone with the camera gear needed to film his experiences. He has no sleeping bag or tent. His shelter and bedding is whatever he builds or locates in the environment, and his food and water come from his surroundings. He has his ever present multitool, maybe a knife or axe, possibly a firestarter, and aside from the appropriate clothing, very little other survival gear.

He shows himself sometimes failing to secure food or water. He sometimes makes mistakes and he shows that also. These are not training films: they are films of Les Stroud making fallible choices on how to survive, and often of the very real suffering he endures of hunger, cold, and life threatening heat and thirst.",1233878400,,862,4.904109589041096

He really shares tons of information, and even shows where he got the skills and information in the special feature of The Making of Survivorman.  Sometimes he screws up but sometimes he does such a good job you think even YOU could live on a Pacific Island without any problems.",1232928000,2,477,4.409090909090909

The VSC release sells for 29.99 CDN while the Discovery release sells for 19.02 CDN... if you don't know what I'm talking about go to Amazon. CA and you can search Survivorman Season 2 and you'll find releases from both studios.  Amazon. COM on the other hand only carries the Discovery studio releases.

The information and survival skills that he shows is accurate, and entertaining. This is not a boring show where he just talks about what to do, he demonstrates it in a very entertaining fashion. Unlike ""Man VS Wild"", Les is real. He does not fake his show or give wrong information. I highly recomend this show to anyone who is trying to learn survival information.

Though I am also a Bear Grylles fan, I think Survivorman shows more of a practical, realistic approach to survival. I was saddened to see that Survivor man is ending it's series, I think.

3448174,1,B001AHPB2Y,"I neglected to look at the reviews for this as I got it as part of a ""deal.""  Had I read the reviews I would not have purchased.

The video:  Well...it's fake letter-boxed.  So you end up with black bars on all four sides if you plan on watching it on a wide screen display.  As a result, the video only takes up roughly half the screen.  And the video quality varies from episode to episode.  A couple look pretty good, and others...not so good.  They are all watchable, and probably about as good as you'd see them on standard cable.  But you expect more from a DVD set.

The Audio:  The audio isn't bad at all, really.  It's 2.0 stereo, nothing fancy.  One reviewer mentioned that the sound was out of synch.  I hadn't noticed that yet.

The DVD:  This looks like something you'd get from a NY city street vendor.  There are no menus of any kind.  And the second episode starts half way through a chapter, so you can't even chapter skip to it.  As others have mentioned, it is a DVD-R.  Says it right on the paper, inkjet-printed cheesey label.  So the DVD quality is really below anything you'd expect from anyone aside from, as I said, a street urchin peddling DVDs they made from episodes they downloaded off the Internet.  If you look at the back of the case, you'll see:

""Manufactured by CreateSpace, An Amazon.com Company""

Honestly, I'm debating returning these.  I got them as a gift for someone who is a huge fan of the show and is convalescing from surgery.  I'm embarrassed to give these to him, honestly.

I'm hoping the first season set is much better than these.",1226275200,8,1580,4.414634146341464

I don't know if this set is being created legally, but it's $40 compared with the REAL set at $15. There are no extra features or episode.  If you look at the bottom of the description, it says something like ""this dvd set is created on demand with DVD-R discs.  Ummm, who is making this? Take this off the shelves, Amazon.

By the way, my opinion of the show (on the 2 disc set) is that it ROCKS!  Original, funny, impressive techniques in layman's terms, lots of teaching and learning by experience and looks like a lot of fun!  Not fake or contrived.",1225670400,8,768,4.219178082191781
