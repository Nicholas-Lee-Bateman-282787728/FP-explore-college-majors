6994159,4,B00SX3P4RU,"SPEEDY SYNOPSIS: Media students, cocky and laddish Raz (Glasspool), sweet Jess (Orange) and the smart, no-nonsense Charlie (Quinlan) have to make a documentary, complete with behind the scenes footage for their course.
After taking some advice on the subject from their tutor, filmmaker Mark (Herbert), they choose the subject of cyber-bullying. However, soon their amateur investigatons lead them into the case of missing local girl Rosy Clarke.
When the three start to suspect that Rosy's creepy older boyfriend Seth (Rhodes) may be involved in not just this but the disappearance of another young woman, they realise they could be on to a dream project and dig a little deeper, determined to document the whole thing.
Will they discover the truth about the girls? Will their efforts bring them some unwanted attention? And have they got in over their heads?

THE BEST BITS (mild spoiler warning): At its core The Cutting Room is an interesting horror/thriller hybrid. Giving us a believable and credible reason for its 'found-footage', the plot is advanced by the documentary part of the students' film while the characterisation is fleshed out in their interaction during the 'making of' scenes. It's a simple but clever idea, and should be applauded.
The mystery itself is pretty compelling, although the genuinely unnerving opening scene gives us a pretty good idea of what has befallen the missing girls. Equally, the characterisation is pretty strong with our main trio all well drawn and given enough screentime and dialogue to establish themselves and their personalities.
Hollyoaks' Glasspool is undoubtedly given the most, with plenty of amusing lines (most notably his on the nose impressions of Danny Dyer and a familiar scene from The Blair Witch Project). He's a pretty damn good actor and with his looks I'm sure he'll have plenty of female fans who'll be picking this up when it's released next week. Orange is likeable as 'the nice one' of the group and doesn't put a foot wrong throughout her performance. I expect we'll be seeing plenty more of her.
I was also very impressed with Quinlan. She plays the feistier, more emotional member of the group and was utterly believable in the role. She is quite the talent, handling some charged and challenging scenes with aplomb. She is definitely one to watch!
Rhodes is also very good, layering just enough menace on his character without turning him into a moustache-twirling pantomime villain. He doesn't have a huge amount of screentime, but he does an admirable job with what he has. So too does Herbert as the students' put-upon course tutor. Good work, gentlemen.
As I said earlier, The Cutting Room is a thriller/horror hybrid and as good as the thriller scenes are, it really goes up a gear at the point that the film moves into the horror section in the abandoned army barracks later on in proceedings. The sets and locations, from the dense woodland surrounding the barracks to the labyrinthine bunker system certainly add to this. They are tremendously atmospheric and very claustrophobic, which does a massive amount of the work for Dudley. That's not to say that Dudley isn't a skilled director  far from it. Making a found footage film in a believable way is a genuine skill, crafting a film which doesn't seem too contrived and maintains the realism of the concept that found footage is built upon requires significant talent.
Dudley has this talent in spades. He also has a superb knowledge of the mechanics of crafting a scare. The use of building tension, of timing, not just using what the camera shows but what it keeps hidden  lesser directors do not understand this and their movies fall flat. Dudley crafts his frights perfectly, making the climax of the film a legitimately creepy experience. Dudley also wrote the picture and his story is actually cleverer than you may expect. It's not just in the plotting that follows a perfectly logical narrative and never betrays its own internal logic, or even the twists in the tale. What struck me as very smart was the way that the very final scene, when pondered in more depth, gives the viewer plenty of reasons to re-examine and re-evaluate everything that has come before. It's more than just a nice mystery, it raises a lot of questions about filmmaking itself.
Finally, I adored the soundtrack to the film, in particular the use of Barrie Gledden and Kes Loy's In The Mood For Food. The quirky, 1920s style number is used to perfection during the opening scene of the film, it's light-hearted whimsy marvellously juxtaposed with the horrific events occurring onscreen. Much like the way Tiny Tim's Tiptoe Thru The Tulips uses an out-of-time eeriness an creepily childish innocent to make the scares of Insidious all the more haunting, In The Mood For Food is a fantastic complement to the scenes it accompanies. Kudos to whoever found and attached it to this movie.

THE WORST BITS (mild spoiler warning): Well, The Cutting Room is a found footage film. I know plenty of readers will see the dreaded 'Double F' and instantly dismiss the movie. If shaky cam and shadows appearing then disappearing from POV is something that guarantees you'll roll your eyes, there's not much here that will change your mind. In the movie's defence, the obligatory credulity-stretching 'why the Hell are they still filming?' section is kept short and most of the footage feels like a real student documentary, but be aware that the pitfalls that come with the subgenre are still present.
While I was a fan of the cast, I did feel that at points the characterisation was a little off. For example, Raz is involved in a romantic relationship with one of the young ladies but it wasn't very strongly presented at all. In fact, when he introduced his 'girlfriend' at one of the group's interviews I actually went 'Oh, really?'
I can't help but feel that an extra five minutes of interaction between the couple could have helped flesh this out and added some extra emotional weight during the film's climax.
On a similar character note, I liked Raz's laddishness most of the time but on a couple of occasions he slipped into a cartoonish Inbetweeners place. There's a fine line between being a bit rude and just being a pervert and he veered perilously close to crossing it at times. In films such as this it's important that the audience sympathises with and likes the main characters, and Glasspool has to work very hard indeed to ensure that his character doesn't just come across as a sex pest.
Finally, the film has a nice twist in the tail but, unfortunately, I thought it was a little easy to see coming.

THE VERDICT: I can think of far worse ways to spend an evening than with this deliciously dark little effort. Warren Dudley manages a nice balancing act and combines an enthralling mystery with a genuinely disturbing horror flick. Fans of Glasspool will undoubtedly flock to this, and if you want a cool, clever Brit flick (and haven't yet been burnt out by Found Footage), this is well worth your time.",1441152000,2,7032,4.8811715481171545

6994164,1,B00SX3P4RU,"Pretty atrocious low-budget British horror opens promisingly with a sequence that involves a Polaroid photo, a terrified coed chained to a table, a song that sounds like a crackly old 78 playing in the background and something terrible happening that is making the girl scream and shudder--although whatever that might be is just out of frame.

After that credits sequence the movie goes downhill super fast.  The Cutting Room turns into to the story of three spectacularly unlikable and one-dimensional film school students (2 girls and 1 guy) who decide to make a documentary about cyber-bullying for their final class project.  Then they realize that none of them actually knows someone who has been cyber-bullied or knows how to find anyone who has (why not try the internet?) so they turn to their film teacher who suggests they look into a girl from the news who recently disappeared--supposedly she ran away because of cyber-bullying.  Since it's the girl from the opening sequence we know that things aren't going to turn out well for the film students.

The missing girl's sister blames a young man who she claims took her sister and grooms other girls--and it turns out that guy has a connection to their teacher, you know--the guy who suggested they investigate the disappearance in the first place?  Add in the fact that teach seems to have a thing for impressionable female coeds and you would think his students might be a wee bit suspicious.

At any rate The Cutting Room eventually devolves into typical handheld garbage with characters running around with a shaky camera in the dark, panicking and screaming out each others names.  This type of thing didn't work in Blair Witch Project but at least it was relatively novel back then--now docu-horror made by people who don't live to see the fruits of their labors has become such a cliche you have to figure at this point that filmmakers who go that route have little talent or imagination since making that type of movie work is virtually impossible--there have been too many camcorder horror films by people who figured anyone could make a camcorder horror film--The Cutting Room has a lot more craft than the worst of these but the imagination necessary to put an interesting spin on the underwritten, overly familiar material is nowhere to be found after the opening minutes so the movie is still very bad.  It's also very short--clocking in at 73 minutes including credits although it feels much longer.",1438819200,,2475,4.916067146282973

We have the ground cam, running cam, and flashlight cam. I liked the odd music for the opening and closing credits. Acting was decent, kudos Lucy-Jane Quinlan. But the film was still bad.

Spoiler:
Most of the movie the students just putz around making their cyber bullying documentary.  There really is no connection between the film they are doing and the vilians in the movie.  There is just a few minutes of screentime with the Ed Gein-type character.  There is no connection between the man who is bringing young girls to the masked bad guy.  You ultimately learn nothing about him or what his motives are.  There is almost no blood and gore at all.  There is about 15 seconds total in ""the cutting room."" The film does a poor job of building suspense and holding your interest.  I didn't give it a 1 star because I have seen films with much worse acting and casting than this.

This film completely let me down because NO action starts until the last 30mins and maybe the last 10mins or so we see anything remotely scary but it's just glimpses, we don't see any real action.

6994192,4,B00SX3P4RU,"Three college students - Raz and his girlfriend Charlie and their friend Jess - are encouraged by their tutor to put together some special features-type footage for their end-of-year Media Studies project. Raz, cheeky beggar, is dissuaded from studying the phenomenon of pornography and instead the trio decide to put together an expose of cyber-bullying, using the mystery of missing fellow students and bullying victims Rosie Clarke and Clara Jenkins as their subjects. Their investigations bring them into contact with some severely-weird individuals and, eventually, a rendezvous - at dead of night, idiots! - at a long-abandoned army barracks in some nearby forests. There, you won't be surprised to discover, something nasty awaits

The Cutting Room is a brisk, no-nonsense effort which initially presents as just an intriguing mystery story as the trio turn detective in the wake of apparent Police disinterest in the missing girls. But theres an ever-present sense of growing ease as their investigations send them in ever more disquieting directions and the films atmosphere becomes more stifling and uncomfortable. The unknown cast are all commendably competent (watch out for the gloriously-named Andromeda Godfrey as Charlies mother) and their banter and relationships are hugely warm and naturalistic with the snarky Raz (Glasspool) cast very much in the mould of Jay from The Inbetweeners with his one-track mind and inappropriate comments. Inevitably the films focus is lost towards the end as it cant help blundering headfirst into the usual cliches of the genre with our heroes wandering around dark tunnels lit by a torch beam screaming and shouting Oh My God! at three-second intervals.

Just when it looks as if The Cutting Room has thrown away all the goodwill earned by its first hour with some confusing and simplistic conclusion, theres a killer twist/reveal in the final scene which will leave you gasping and reaching for the rewind button. Its always a joy when a film which seems to offer little more than an absolute waste of seventy-odd minutes of your life turns into a little gem and The Cutting Room, found footage from a very English perspective, suggests that there can be more to the genre than yapping High School kids lost in the forest and numbskull teams of TV reporters exploring spooky abandoned buildings where nasty things have happened.

The Cutting Room only cost 12,000 to make but nothing about it feels small budget. The cinematography is really impressive and you get this constant feeling that the characters are being watched. Many of the scenes are filmed underground in the disused army barracks yet the viewers is treated to all the gruesome bits in gory, vivid detail.

A lot of the film is ""found footage"" but the quality is so much better, in my opinion, than The Blair Witch Project. In that film, I found it pretty unwatchable but in this film it was of a quality good enough to enjoy the film while still getting the pants scared off you.

I really enjoyed the plot and the characters, who seemed believable in terms of English students. I'd definitely like to keep an eye on Lucy-Jane Quinlan and Lydia Orange in the future.

Definitely pay attention when watching the film and look out for the clues. If you don't, the finale is going to terrify you, as it did me. The final scenes take place over 15 terrifying minutes where the viewer is kept firmly on the edge of your seat.

More than the first half of the movie is them filming themselves attempting to put together a movie. The dialog is stupid. The filming is horrible. It is lower than low budget. In fact the whole thing could have been done on one of their smart phones.

It is 50 minutes in to the 72 minute film before there is any semblance of suspense/horror.

There is no character development. There is no soundtrack. The acting is poor. What plot there is, is a joke. There is no clue as to the source of the evil and basically the film ends with them all being killed. Unlike other movies where there is suspense and horror surrounding the killing.
