3903831,5,B002C4N5L8,This picture was on TV when I was young. It was always one of my favorites.  It was always unavailable.  I decided to check out Amazon.com and was not dissapointed.  The move arrived in a very timely manner and the picture quality of the film was excellent.  I'm extremely happy that I finally have added this to my movie collection,1337990400,5,332,4.483333333333333
3903832,4,B002C4N5L8,"[MY BLOOD RUNS COLD - (1965) - Widescreen presentation]  Fans of stars Joey Heatherton and Troy Donahue have reason to rejoice in the release of this minor film from the Warner Archive Collection, as it slipped under the radar for most upon initial release. This probably due to the fact that it was shot in B+W; after all, it was the mid 60's and everyone who went to the movies then went to see the glorious color films of the day - unless your folks had bucks, you probably only had a B+W TV at home. I was initially bummed to find it wasn't in color, but this flick benefits greatly from director William Conrad's choice to film it this way, as it's an American gothic pseudo-horror tale that takes place on the West Coast, and shooting it in color would have ruined it, reducing it to a lightweight beach blanket flick.

Joey Heatherton proves she has solid acting chops (as well as mad dancing skills) here as Julie, the spoiled rich young heiress who's prematurely bored with her life, taking to crashing family cars and wrecking family boats. She nearly kills a motorcycle driver, her boyfriend and herself along the shore road one day and the cycle driver, Ben (Troy Donahue), swears he knows her. In fact, he proclaims they were lovers in a former life. (And this predated the widespread use of LSD). He's a bit bruised up, so Julie and her beau take him to her home for medical treatment by the family doctor. Barry Sullivan plays her father, an egocentric widowed tycoon, and Jeanette Nolan gives a standout performance as her aunt. (Her dialogue, fashions and hairstyles are terrific). Ben insists he knows Julie, and makes shocking statements about the family's past that no one should have access to. Julie initially finds him creepy, but her aunt is both fascinated and uneasy about his comments.

Ben pursues Julie relentlessly, even giving her an antique locket with a picture of her in her former incarnation inside, and soon enough, her boredom with her conservative boyfriend sends her into Ben's arms. Her father protests in the typical Romeo and Juliet fashion, so they eventually plan on running away together. As soon as they do, skeletons from Ben's closet collide with the skeletons in Julie's family history, and toxic tensions mount on the stormy seas off the California Coast for all concerned. A somewhat predictable conclusion ensues but leaves one content, entertained and satisfied when end credits roll. Joey looks darling with longer hair and even manages to do a little wiggle and giggle dance maneuver at one point, reminding us who she was and what we remember her for. Troy looks dreamy (I guess) for his female fans, but I never thought much of his acting ability, and his studio dropped his contract shortly after this film. Is this a great film? Certainly not. But for fans of the stars, gothic elements or 60's cinema, it's quite engaging. Will your blood run cold? Probably not, unless anemia runs in your family, but anemia's preferred to what runs in this family's past.

Flawless video and audio quality, chalk up another winner from Warner's Archive Collection.",1309219200,9,3110,4.7966417910447765
3903833,4,B002C4N5L8,"Wow, I never heard something or seen this movie before. I was wondering when I found this WArner Archive Collection here on Amazon. I was not really sure if would be it (the movie) in good quality (in sound and picture) - and yes, it is in very good condition (very sharp and clean!)

But I was surprised. OK, on this release are no Chapters, subtitles or bonus features - but the movie was a thrilling and romantic movie in black & white with Troy Donahue.",1269734400,5,457,4.313953488372093
3903834,5,B002C4N5L8,"The gorgeous Troy Donahue starrs, with Joey Heatherton and Barry Sullivan in this entertaining black and white movie. My blood runs cold is the story of Julie( Joey Heatherton) a wealthy young spoiled Heiress, who accidently runs off Ben ( Troy Doanhue) with her car on the californian coastline. He tries to convince julie he and her were lovers in a past life - their own ancestors . Young and naive Julie soon falls for good looking Ben, unaware of the dark secret Ben hides from her.  I really enjoyed watching this movie, both Troy Donahue and Joey Heatherton exhibit good chemistry as torn lovers sharing a unique bond and fascination with each other. The movie does hold your attention ( well it did hold my attention while troy was in the scene) the story line is interesting and different. Although l think the movie would have been better if they had filmed it in colour. Filmed in 1965 it was the last Warner Bros movie for Troy Donahue after they cancelled his contract. A nice little vintage classic pure escapism.",1260230400,20,1027,4.6740331491712706

8363131,4,B002C4N5L8,What director William Conrad successfully attains in this Hitchcock homage is a foreboding sense of the supernatural.  For a goodly part this account of a couple possibly reincarnated from doomed ancestors from a century ago is effective if not for some telegraphing of the twist ending by star Troy Donahue.  Regardless the film is mostly a success and Conrad has gathered a terrific ensemble.  High point is Joey Heatherton salaciously swiveling her hips and posterior to a jazzy ditty playing on the radio.  Conrad's unmistakable voice can be heard in cameo on a police radio.,1444348800,2,579,5.063157894736842

8363134,4,B002C4N5L8,"High quality product shipped very quickly.  Good movie, though not as good as I remember it--a bit predictable and last third of it is a bit redundant--but the cinematography is gorgeous, the score is good and Troy Donahue/Joey Heatherton give the best performances of their careers.  William Conrad was a good director, even though we remember him as ""Cannon.""

The last time I saw this film was in the late 1970s/very early 80s on the Saturday night Chiller Movie Double Feature.  Back then, it was surprising to see a movie as ""recent"" as 1965 airing.  The only other ""newer"" films they showed were ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"" and ""The Skull.""  Today, these are all considered ""old"" movie classics!  It goes by so fast, doesn't it?",1431907200,3,736,4.84
