5261269,2,B0094GMR8E,"Attempting to be educational, this video falls short with a story about neither love, nor real friendship, but a poor  story of opposites. The children were not interested past the commercial recognition of the obnoxious Martin Short character.",1365206400,3,244,5.421052631578948

5261273,5,B0094GMR8E,I bought three of these for some of my younger grandchildren for Valentine's day.  The price was great (I have 9 grandchildren to buy gifts for) and they all enjoyed it.  It is hard to beat Dr. Seuss.,1363046400,,200,4.2368421052631575

5261289,4,B0094GMR8E,"I personally love the Cat in the Hat shows for my children.  However, for some reason the kids couldn't really enjoy this one all the way through.  It is really, really short so I'm glad I got it on sale.  Normally when I get these I try to get ones that are at least 45 minutes to 60 minutes long.  There isn't a lot about Valentine's Day which is OK with us because the kids like to watch it other times of the year as well.  Overall, though, it's pretty good.  The kids will sit and watch this one for at least half the time. ;)",1428019200,,531,3.9622641509433962

8535848,3,B0094GMR8E,We love cat in the hat! Be aware though this isn't really a Valentine's special movie like I had hoped (the Halloween one is one of my toddlers favorites year round- I was looking forward to it being like that and the Xmas one where it's a holiday related adventure). This only the intro is Valentine's-y and then it's episodes from the tv show.,1523664000,,345,4.40625
8535849,5,B0094GMR8E,My great nephew loved the video.  His mama tried to snap his photo for me after he got his valentines package I ordered from Amazon for him.  He was smiling in the pic but his eyes were side ways because he couldn't stop watching this movie!,1518825600,,241,4.217391304347826
