2649489,5,B000I0QLQO,The movie follows the novel very closely.  The main problem is that Amazon could not supply the DVD and cancelled the order.  I hope they will be able to offer the DVD in the near future.,1174089600,21,187,4.166666666666667
2649547,3,B000I0QLQO,"Pretty good cast but a convoluted and confusing plot made it hard to follow at some points and hard to believe in.

The basic gist of the story is that some cold war era freelance spies get together for another mission and go off to the Soviet Union on a quest to recover a letter.

The spies are pretty amoral in their approach which probably is not far off from the truth but on the whole I just did not believe in what was going on, and I have to either get interested in what is happening because the story is good enough, or believe in what is going on, and I just didn't on either account.

It was an Ok movie as far as I am concerned and had a few good scenes, and even a few side stories that were interesting. But overall, I came out of it thinking it was another of those movies that could have been a lot better.",1472342400,,823,4.0060975609756095

Another thing odd are the disconnected sequences. At one point Richard Boone has some kind of fight with Patrick O'Neal for some reason or other. This is probably the worst piece of fight choreography on film.  Huston is not an action director.

2649574,4,B000I0QLQO,"To say this is a hard-as-nails tale is an understatement. One of the least glamorous spy films I can recall, and it is all the better for it. This was directed by the great John Huston. It's somewhat hard to get hold of in the DVD version. I simply purchased a digital copy from Amazon (HD).

Most of the Russians are played by Swedes or Poles (fans of Bergman and Hitchcock will recognize some tried-and-trues). All the actors are excellent with Bibi Andersson, Richard Boone, and Patrick O'Neal bringing their A-games. Naturally, since this was the actual Cold War, Moscow is played by the lovely city of Helsinki (easily the most Russian-looking city in the West due to a long history as part of the Russian Empire).

The film does not shy away from a multiplicity of themes. Homosexual trysts, male hustlers for women of the nomenclature, drug dealers and black marketeers, and ruthless tactics on both sides of the curtain add depth and complexity to this gritty tale. Get the HD version- the color is excellent. A remarkable lesser-known film from one of the great directors of the last century.

I say it's nearly impossible to piece together the complex plot and shifting characters until about the fourth time on screen. If you like gadgets and thrills and the eye candy of James Bond, look elsewhere. If you like spy movies that are a puzzle of clues and a maze of hidden agendas, you might like this film. The average moviegoer will glaze over in numbed confusion after 15 minutes - this is a delicacy for polished tastes. Orson Welles, George Stephens and Max von Sydow are as never before in surprising roles. Richard Boone is peerless in Oscar quality acting as a scheming duplicitous mastermind. This is a story of people using and being used in a puppet show only 1 or 2 puppeteers and manipulators pulling the strings fully understand.

2649596,5,B000I0QLQO,"Based on and true to the best seller of that time of the same name, with a first rate international cast, and written and  directed by the great John Huston one wonders why this movie failed at the box office.  The only reason I can think of is that it is such a cold-blooded, pitiless and remorseless look at espionage during the Cold War that it's callous and despairing view of the whole enterprise put off many.  And it is complicated, and you do have to pay attention from the first frame onward or it is easy to become lost in the labrynthine plot and double and triple crosses.  There are several stories playing out within the same plot and they all culminate in one of the cruelest, most chilling finales I've ever seen in film.

As explained early on, espionage prior to World War II was played by often unaffiliated professional spies.  A ring of these old spies are tasked to find the Letter of the title.  With code names like The Highwayman, The Whore, The Erector Set, The Warlock, Sweet Alice, etc., these old semi-retired pros who operated together during the War are brought together, along with two young recruits, and sent to Moscow.  Once in Moscow they set about infiltrating themselves by exploiting every human weakness, be it sex or drugs or whatever, in an effort to regain the letter and get out before they are discovered by Col. Kosnov, the vicious KGB counter-intelligence chief.  In the process, everyone gets played and betrayed. To say more would give too much away.

The tone of the film is expressed early on by John Huston himself as a US Navy Admiral, cutting Patrick O'Neal loose from the Navy to be seconded to an intelligence service, and making no bones about his disgust with the growing intelligence establishment.  World War II changed intelligence from the Great Game of Kipling to the ruthless and pragmatic duels of the CIA and KGB bureaucracies.  As is made plain in the film, these spies all worked and knew each other (Soviet, English and American), during the war and then turned on one another after the war.

This is the Cold War.  Much forgotten now, except by those who lived through it.  This film was made at the height of that Cold War and reflects exactly the amorality of it all.  There are no heroes here, only innocents and exploiters.  Each side did whatever was needed and all one has to think of is the absolute scumbags we supported simply because they were anti-communist.  We were in a titanic struggle with The Soviets on a world stage, and anyone and anything was fair game.  And cruel practicality and efficiency were the norm.  The Kremlin Letter was an expression of that heartless universe and a reminder of the cost of it.

The whole cast is great, with Richard Boone and Max Von Sydow outstanding as old allies/adversaries.  Patrick O'Neal and Barbara Parkins as the neophyte spies are good, and supporting roles are filled by George Sanders, Orson Welles, Dean Jagger, Bibi Andersson and the like.

It will be hard to find, as this DVD, which I bought, was a limited issue with no frills.  Hope it turns up on some movie channels, because it is well worth a look.",1395619200,3,3140,4.636528028933093

The plot: 5 Americans sent out to infiltrate the Moscow sex-and-drugs underworld to retrieve an incriminating document.

Viewing tips:

Try not to pay too much attention to the fate of the letter itself; that's just the McGuffin. I think an over-concentration on the letter is what turned off many reviewers when the movie was released. Let it go. It isn't really about the letter; it's about personal betrayal.

Stories are told about the old days of espionage, of people and incidents. It's great to have a film with a rich sense of history, and this works well to provide context and atmosphere, but it's actually more than that; try to pay close attention. It'll pay off.

OK, some of it's hokey around the edges; again, let it go.

General notes:

It's closely based on a novel by Noel Behn--descendant of Aphra Behn (d. 1698), the first woman in history to make a living playwriting. She was also a foreign spy for Charles II. Perhaps it's ironic (or genetic) that, as Wikipedia says,

""[B]iographer Janet Todd noted that Behn 'has a lethal combination of obscurity, secrecy and staginess which makes her an uneasy fit for any narrative, speculative or factual. She is not so much a woman to be unmasked as an unending combination of masks'"".

What a cast list(!) They all give sterling performances, there are no star turns here. Using all their considerable talents, they completely inhabit their characters. But you have to give it up especially for the star turn by the spectacular and wonderful Richard Boone.

It also has one of the best abduction scenes ever--dynamic, surprising and excruciatingly suspenseful, worthy of the best Hitchcock.",1381795200,,1677,4.935943060498221

2649700,4,B000I0QLQO,"No major American director has had a lower percentage of his films available on DVD than John Huston. Part of the reason is that Huston made a number of his films for smaller, newer companies that appeared after the collapse of the old studio system in the late 1960s. These companies quickly went bust leaving the question of who owns the rights to these films in limbo. Another is that Huston's choice of material was eclectic and mostly downbeat in tone which is never a key to financial success on the big screen or off. THE KREMLIN LETTER was innocent of the first charge having been made for 20th Century Fox but not of the second for its overall tone and outlook at international espionage makes THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD look like a comedy. Still there were films like it already out there so its failure came as a suprise to Huston and to Fox. The real surprise is that Fox has not allowed it to be on any form of home video until now. Be thankful for small favors but hurry as this is only a limited edition.

The complex plot involves a group of older spies outside the major agencies who are hired to retrieve an embarrasing letter that could cause an international incident. They recruit a young man with total recall (Patrick O'Neal in a role intended for James Coburn) to join them in their effort. The group is headed up by Richard Boone, an amiable Texas type who is more complex than he seems. The film features a dream cast of character actors (George Sanders, Nigel Green, Dean Jagger, Orson Welles) who add spice and a sense of fun to the proceedings. The main villian is a KGB department head played by Max von Sydow whose one weakness is his wife (Bibi Andersson). The movie plays out against expectations with an ending that has real bite. If you enjoy intelligent spy thrillers than THE KREMLIN LETTER is one of the best so grab it while you can. It's being released by a small outfit called Twilight Time (check out their website -screenarchives.com- ) who have done a first class job with this title.

I have never heard of this film until today, (April 14, 2009); apparently it was a flop in 1970, I cannot imagine how this isn't hailed as a classic the world over.  The realism and believability of the ""hard espionage"" mind games portrayed in this film make it a worthy addition to any collection.  I can only hope and pray that it is released soon.",1239667200,12,603,4.463636363636364
2649704,4,B000I0QLQO,"For you Paladin-Richard Boone fans, yes he was strange in 'The Kremlin Letter.  I saw it in the movies first time around in 1968 I think it was. But since you can't get it here in the USA (I hear it's available in England but the DVD is incompatiable with American players), and if you like Boone in freak, check him out instead in either, ""Night of the Following Day"" with Marlon Brando and Rita Moreno or as the cold-blooded killer 'Canino"" in the Robert Mitchum updated version of the Raymond Chandler-Humphrey Bogart hit, ""The Big Sleep"".  You won't forget him in either film!",1221868800,8,580,4.5673076923076925
2649705,5,B000I0QLQO,"One of the best spy movies I've ever seen.  Deception, betrayal, violence, sex, perversion--and that's just in the opening credits.  But seriously, it is a great movie and I want to be able to share it with friends.  After growing up with Richard Boone on Paladin, his blond persona in this movie was quite a shock.",1207440000,17,315,4.589285714285714

8142792,1,B000I0QLQO,"Talky spy movie about an elaborate operation by Americans to retrieve the letter of the title even though it doesn't seem anywhere near consequential enough to justify all the trouble. That's really besides the point since the letter is just a MacGuffin--whether they were trying to retrieve microfilm or a file or weapons plans or whatever in the end it would have amounted to the same thing--it's just an excuse for the mission to exist. Talky little to no action spy films were fairly hard to pull off successfully if you didn't have strong material to work with like a John le Carr&eacute; novel. The Kremlin Letter is so tedious as to be virtually unwatchable--basically, it's two hours of dialogue scenes that never really seem to be heading anywhere in particular. There's no suspense whatsoever, no action, no memorable dialogue, no characters that are interesting--the whole thing is just one painfully dull slog that makes you wish you were watching The Spy Who Came in From the Cold or The Icpress File instead. Director, producer, cowriter John Huston made a handful of classic films that helped cement his reputation but the reality is he probably made more bad films than good--he seemed to be much more interested in working regularly than quality control. Between 1941 and 1987, which is a span of 46 years, he has 47 directing credits and 55 acting credits. Working at that pace it's probably a small miracle that he made as many good films as he did. The Kremlin Letter isn't one of the good ones.",1498953600,,1515,4.8084291187739465
8142793,5,B000I0QLQO,"It's hard to believe I had never seen this gem of a Cold War spy thriller. John Huston, Orson Welles, Patrick O'Neal, Nigel Green and the rest of the cast make this movie stand out among typically bleaker offerings set behind the Iron Curtain (as this film mostly is). It's not perfect but it is a fun, ruminative romp through the old high-stakes counterespionage artifice, done right. O'Neal's intelligent, ascetic secret agent -- recruited against his will from active service in the U.S. Navy -- makes the short list of movie greats in that role. Don't miss it.",1498953600,2,564,4.76530612244898
8142794,4,B000I0QLQO,Excellent adaption of a book set in the winter of 1969-1970 during the Cold War concerning a diplomatic letter that should never have been written. The job of recovery is farmed out to a group of former agents now turned private. Very little is as it seems and the film will keep your attention. The cast is excellent and John Huston's screenplay closely parallels the book.,1489449600,5,374,4.681818181818182

A spy film that will keep you on edge till the very end. This for me is about as close as it gets in the real world of spycraft. Real spies chasing each other. No exploding fountain pen nukes and NO Tom Cruise! Yay!!",1485648000,,361,4.246376811594203
8142797,5,B000I0QLQO,"This movie isn't the standard espionage film. It has an array of actors, good, but odd. I have to admit, when I first saw this, I was surprised to see Boone in a role that wasn't in a western. I like this film because it is different. Huston made something that doesn't fit nicely in the spy genre and yet has a quality to it. I will not try to explain the plot, but I will say that if you want something that is a polar opposite of 007, this is it.",1483401600,,449,3.891304347826087
