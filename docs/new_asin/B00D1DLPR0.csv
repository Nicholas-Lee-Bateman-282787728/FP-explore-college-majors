8588312,2,B00D1DLPR0,"was hoping this would be an informative method of learning some kirtan songs.  yet only the most basic getting to know the harmonium parts was included..with much time spent on taking apart the harmonium . i think it's important to understand the instrument and how it works, but then the title should be different. Perhaps, Learning the Harmonium Parts,  would be a more appropriate title than, Playing Kirtan on Harmonium, since no Kirtan songs were actually learned.  the indian scale note names were taught, but not shown how to transpose those scales into anything other than  c minor ..  he did not even teach about half steps and whole steps and the way you create a scale from a starting note.  such a short video, with little substance.. wanted to love it though",1421452800,2,771,4.7593984962406015

8588314,5,B00D1DLPR0,"If you are looking for a good introduction to playing the Harmonium and singing Kirtan, Daniel Tucker is the one that you are looking for. Daniel's enthusiasm and joy shine through these easy to follow and easy to apply introductory lessons. I went from a non playing, semi-singing Kirtan lover, to a harmonium playing, Om Namah Shivaya singing Kirtan ""LOVER"" in just a few short weeks.....Namaste",1370822400,,397,5.03030303030303
8588315,5,B00D1DLPR0,I PURCHASED DANIEL'S LEARNING SYSTEM IN MARCH 2013 AND HAVE BEEN TRULY AMAZED WITH HOW MUCH I HAVE LEARNED.  HE BREAKS THE INFORMATION INTO DIGESTABLE BLOCKS THAT EVEN SOMEONE WITH NO MUSICAL BACKGROUND CAN UNDERSTAND.  IT'S LIKE HAVING AN EXPERT AT YOUR HOUSE!  MY WIFE AND I EVEN PLAYED A KIRTAN WITH 48 PEOPLE IN LATE APRIL AND HAVE BEEN ASKED TO RETURN AND PLAY THIS MONTH!!!!  Jai Sita Ram Jai Jai Hanuman!!,1370822400,,412,4.602739726027397
