8443755,5,B004VPUQTK,"Derrick Simmons gets five stars and two thumbs up on this hilarious follow up to his first comedy ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jump-Offs/dp/B004ZIEL0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jump Offs</a>"" - ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-Do-It-Better/dp/B004VPUQTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women Do It Better</a>"".  All of your favorite guy players are back in this film, still trying to get one over on their female counter parts.  Derrick not only returns as ""Malik"", but also takes on the remarkable task of playing three additional character roles, of which my own personal favorite is ""Oops"".  Oops is a somewhat unattractive guy you might expect to be a bit awkward with the ladies, but instead; he will reassure you he has earned and is very deserving of his ""player"" stripes.  Watch as these slick and relentless lady players turn the table on the guys time after time.  For all accomplished ""players"" out there, you may find yourself taking notes in between laughs!!  This movie is hardly a chick flick, but instead, an entertaining and comical play on relationships - definitely a ""must see""!!",1312243200,5,1181,6.041916167664671
