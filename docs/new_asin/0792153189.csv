129999,4,0792153189,"A somewhat dated disaster movie (from an effects perspective), that is enjoyable because of the wonderful human characterizations that are normally lacking from movies like this.

130006,4,0792153189,"Pretty leisurely story through the first hour or so, then becomes more intense and gripping. Much better nuanced than Armageddon, which I understand was released about the same time. Robert Duvall is pretty talented, ranging from ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" to sacrificing himself on a comet for the sake of the entire world.

Also one of the best lines in a movie: ""I know you're just a reporter, but you used to be a human.""",1494892800,,442,4.525

130008,4,0792153189,"Deep Impact went along those times that the end of the world by meteor was big money.  This one, for some reason, just didn't make quite the splash (pun inserted at no additional charge to reader) that the others had.  Honestly, this was a very decent movie.  Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall hold this film together in a way that should have made each proud of the production.

Bottom line of the film is a meteor his heading to Earth which will cause an Extinction-Level Event (E.L.E.).  The acronym, when overheard on in a phone conversation with the president, is heard as Ellie, a woman's name leading to confusion or thoughts of infidelity from the president.  This brings in a news reporter who follows the crumbs and not only finds out Ellie isn't a mistress on the side, but the E.L.E. is significant and real.

The storyline is really enjoyable.  I'm amazed at all the people who chose to give it bad scores on IMDb.  This is a much better movie, a better story, and certainly better acting than the film with Bruce Willis and others.

Deep Impact offers a glimpse of hope where there was none in the E.L.E.",1493510400,,1117,4.54

130121,3,0792153189,It was okay.  Very predictable and without the real tension.  Squeaky clean all the way through with warm fuzzies as a result of family 'dramas' being worked out in the most superficial way and very nicey nice.

130123,5,0792153189,"When this film first began, I thought it would be a copy of Armageddon- but it wasn't, at all.  It was longer than most movies, which surprised me, but every minute was worth the wait.  The writers took great care developing the complex story lines and wove them together in a brilliant manner.  There was a point when I wondered how they could possibly pull all the subplots together before the movie ended.  I won't give any spoilers, but I will just say that the movie is unpredictable in so many ways- from the main plot to how individuals resolve their own personal issues.  I felt genuinely touched by moments in the movie and found myself in that wonderful/terrible emotional state when the credits roll in the end- my heart was full and I wanted more- but knew it had concluded perfectly.  You all know that feeling.  This movie will deliver.",1487116800,2,850,4.589403973509934

Not because of the imminent destruction of the world, but because the US president sends his goons out to terrorize a reporter who became an ""inconvenient nuisance"" to him for revealing what he didn't want to the world to know -- the truth.

That and niggling bits all throughout such as the ""ARK"" located in the limestone caves of the Missouri Ozarks, almost the epicenter for the New-Madrid fault zone area. Then those honed cliches popping up everywhere, Well, suffice it said that the writers were not fully up to the massive job scale and the editing was almost ham-handed where some bits should had been better fleshed out and others trimmed or removed altogether.

130426,1,0792153189,"Almost two decades ago, when I saw it in the theaters, I would have given it a 5 star rating, but now that my brain is fully developed (which isn't saying much being diminished by my 20's) I think the plotline was pure brainwashing. I understand that the simplicity (or shear stupidity) of the governments' (globally) response to foreknowledge of this cataclysmic event (what was it? something to the effect of two years) was to have some sort of dramatic effect at different points of the movie, but I think it goes deeper so as to continue to indoctrinate an already circumscribed people.

I'm sorry but, if the government(s) holds that kind of information from their people like they are god and knows what's best for the population (if it means most of the world's population will most likely die if plan A fails and the government says ""sorry, you sheeple, you don't get the opportunity to prep for this""). Even if it's in a movie, there should not be applause, but public outrage by a people in real life that a movie like this is even made and in it Daddy government says ""too bad so sad, you are not capable of handling yourselves, you children, so you get to die!"" Either the screen writer is so indoctrinated already by the Nanny government (which BTW can't even run the DMV or our public schools among many things) or is too patronizing to give the private man / woman any credit to try to do the right thing by others and themselves given adequate time like the government had.

What I would hope for from the government (along with time to prep): government could divert state and federally owned land to its' citizens (there's a lot out there, trust me I know I live in the Midwest) and do things like stop dumped agricultural surpluses (look it up city folk) and give it to its' people to help them prep! I mean we the people are the governments' boss, not the other way around.

Sorry, for the seemingly anti-government rant on a movie rating, but I am not anti-government, I am former military and work for the state. There is a very beneficial role government should play. I just can't stand that movies like this that try to indoctrinate the people to the tune of government is Daddy and we should just except government determining our lives instead of us doing this ourselves and telling government what their role is in our lives. TAKE BACK THE POWER people and don't allow yourselves to slowly boil in Hollywood's conversion of your minds.

Also, why is it that in these types of movies the government sends only one craft to the approaching meteor, comet, etc.? I sure hope that: A. Our government is already contemplating such an event and B. If it comes to it, we send at least 10 of these ships with a boat load of nukes on each, sending wave after wave of attempts to blow the poop out of the son of a female dog. They shouldn't care, apparently, if they lose a few crews, IE: rules of engagement - Vietnam and Iraq.",1484611200,2,2944,4.497196261682243

131529,2,0792153189,"As much as I like Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall, and normally give any film in which they individually appear a good rating, I thought this was a rather lame excuse for a movie.  I thought the characters they portrayed were poorly developed and failed to enhance the movie the way I would ordinarily expect the presence of either actor to do. In fact, Deep Impact had a number of fine performers in the cast, but the script, or maybe the directing, failed to do justice to the talent pool available. Deep Impact and Armageddon came out in the same year (1998).  I thought that Armageddon was a much more enjoyable (and equally implausible) film.  While the IMDB scores for Deep Impact (6.1) are not all that far below those for Armageddon (6.6).  from my perspective the 'gap' in viewer appeal is much greater.  I certainly won't waste another 2 hours watching it again.",1477526400,3,873,4.642857142857143

The movie wants to bring out hidden qualities and deep character in those impacted by the disaster. But that's all too cliched and superficial. And we only get about ten minutes of actual disaster. So it fails on both fronts. Interesting to compare with Armageddon, which is also a loser, but at least delivers some grandiose disaster effects.

132116,4,0792153189,"Deep Impact still stands as one of the biggest big-budget, mega special effects, disaster movies of all-time. Leaning heavily on what was leading edge CGI technology at the time, it is a visual masterpiece on Blu-Ray that still holds up well when compared to today's films. It is easy to forget that the movie was first released back in 1998. The only real tip-off to its age is things that seem to be missing. No smartphones. No Google. No global warming or terrorism. Those were much simpler times.

The visuals are equally matched by the film's great soundtrack and audio effects, assuming you have a home theater system good enough to appreciate them. The story is compelling and moving at times, but the screenplay seems a bit weak at times. This is made all the more noticeable when combined with some spotty acting from Tea Leone and some of the more minor characters. Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman put in solid performances, but there is some gross overacting by others in several scenes that give the film a rather corny quality at times.

Unlike many other big-budget blockbusters of this film's era (i.e. Independence Day, Armageddon, Terminator 2, The Avengers) the writer's left out a key ingredient in Deep Impact that really stands out when you stop and think about it. There is literally NO humor in this movie whatsoever. Not a single joke. Not one moment of levity. It stuns the senses and tries to tug at your heart strings, but few people will come away from watching this movie in a jovial mood. So, if you need some cheering up, this is definitely a film that should be avoided.

In the end, the real star of this film is its big-budget special effects. They do not disappoint. They even make up for the sometimes sketchy screenplay and occasional over-the-top acting. I've watched the movie several times now and am still impressed.",1466553600,,1858,4.746130030959752

The film does transfer to this format quite well, and yes, the special effects are enhanced ( surround sound also o.k. )
The film tells of a rogue 'Comet' the course of which has been knocked off it's normal path and is now heading for 'Earth'
A crew are sent to intercept with nuclear weapons, the results of the mission not quite as 'Earth' would have hoped.
The story tells of a desperate struggle to escape the oncoming wave that is expected to swallow-up much of the low lying lands.
The film also has a good lead cast including 'Robert Duvall' as 'Spurgeon Tanner' who lends his previous mission expierience to the 'shuttle' crew, also 'Morgan Freeman' ( who plays the 'American' President 'Beck) also among those on earth trying to escape 'impact' 'Elijah Wood' as 'Leo Biederman' ( now that name 'ring's' a bell ) seriously this is as was it when first released...a pretty decent watch, for me the film is an entertaining watch with some good special - effects along the way, not rated by all
critics.......however, i say, certainly worth a viewing, or indeed like myself a re-watch.",1446163200,,1334,4.632911392405063

132416,5,0792153189,"Connection is a concept that is often overlooked as something that is necessary to a productive way of life. Not only can meaningful things be accomplished without help but a person needs human connection in order to thrive and be happy. Whether this is personal connection or done through online methods or letters; people yearn for connection. For some it is an absolute priority, they seek out as many friends and acquaintances that they can and for others they prefer a very small circle of friends. The common factor being people are happy when they have someone that they can talk with, and express ideas and most importantly feelings.

In the film ""Deep Impact"", humanity as a whole is faced with the impending doom of a comet colliding with the Earth destroying all life. While the world's governments attempt various plans to stop the comet they all fail until a small group of people are able to sacrifice themselves for the rest of Earth. While at the same time the remaining main characters on Earth are able to find reconciliation among various emotional differences with other people in order to find happiness.

This is no coincidence. The title may not refer to the impact of the comet into the Earth but rather that we have deep impact amongst others in our lives. This ranges from all forms of relationship types to at times people that we haven't met. The film encourages the ideas of the importance of art and culture within our society, as well as the meaningfulness of the individual. Everyone is important and should never be reduced to a number in a lottery such as the one within the film.

132595,5,0792153189,"Easily one of the best science fiction movies I've ever seen.  It has a good cast, good special effects, a good all-around story, and actually is one of the few science fiction movies that actually gets the science right.  Alright, mostly right.  But most of the important stuff is either right or at least reasonable.

It is the story of a comet that is coming in toward earth, with the possibility of actually hitting it.  As the months pass by and it approaches it turns out it will hit it, unless something stops it.

That is the basic story in a nutshell, but it allows for some interesting story lines along the way.  I liked the characters, found them easy to like and tied up in the story in a number of different ways, from personal problems to the task of trying to stop the comet and saving the world.  We see TV reporters, astronauts, the common folk, the President and various government officials -- quite a nice swathe of humanity, all things and a two-hour running time considered.

If, like me, you're interested in the science behind it, I highly recommend the website of astronomer Phil Plait, Bad Astronomy, and his review of the movie.  The movie has a few blemishes scientifically, but it's far better than all of the SF movies on impactors that I've seen.  And, by reading some of this site, you'll learn that not even the experts have all the answers, not yet.

Meanwhile, you can enjoy an exciting, well-done movie with good characters and a good, solid story.  And some beautiful special effects.",1432512000,,1522,4.613382899628252

132685,5,0792153189,"""Deep Impact"" is one of my top 10 all-time favorite movies. The actors are awesome (Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood) and the suspense is nail-biting. But more than anything else, it's the emotions portrayed in this movie that lift it way above the usual ""end of the world"" fare. People in this movie have to make hard decisions and in some circumstances HUGE sacrifices. Several people pay the ultimate price for the good of family or of the entire world, and it's done in a very non-sappy way. This is one of few moviues I can watch over and over again and still enjoy.",1426809600,,581,4.542857142857143

132787,5,0792153189,"I remember that DEEP IMPACT was released very close in time to ARMAGEDDON. DEEP IMPACT was released on May 5, 1998 and .ARMAGEDDON was released on July 1, 1998. Because of marketing and timing or whatever DEEP IMPACT is somewhat a forgotten film in many respects overshadowed by the successes of ARMAGEDDON. On the surface, these films look thematically similar, but DEEP IMPACT is a far different film. DEEP IMPACT deals with what happens when a seven-mile-wide comet is discovered and revealed to the general public and what attempts will be made to minimize and divert the collision with the Earth. The film features Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman,Ta Leoni, Elijah Wood, Maximilian Schell, Vanessa Redgrave. The way the knowledge of the comet is revealed is very good and intriguing. It just wasn't there one out of the blue, but instead governments have know about it for some time and have kept that knowledge from the public. I think this is a good film and presents several sociological, moral, religious and soul searching perspectives and thought provoking questions to the viewer. In the story, how the nations of Earth deal with the comet and impending doom is quite well represented.",1421798400,,1194,5.005025125628141

I chuckled at the many factual mistakes in the film, some minor like in the very first scene a group of people are using their telescopes where its dark, but they are walking around with flashlights with white light and there are white lamps lit all over. White light totally ruins your vision at night to see stars..any telescope owner would know that. More important are stuff like the teenager just discovering at the star party out of nowhere a rouge comet that is so close he can easily spot it, with a small telescope, but yet professional astronomers have missed it. The biggest error is when the US government builds a bunker for a million people to live for 2 years...not thinking that if the comet impacts in one piece in Canada, an extinction event will occur just as they predicted. But based on the size the President said it was...as big as mount everest...in reality no underground bunker will save the people from extinction. A body that size  would  fracture the Earths crust and bore down into the mantle made of liquid rock and iron. No spot on Earth would be safenfrom such an impact.

""Oceans Rise, Cities Fall, Hope Survives"" - Deep Impact tagline

Four and a half COMPELLING Stars ""Deep Impact"" is a Hollywood disaster/CGI fest, wide-ranging Sci-Fi movie. On a parallel track, It also chronicles a story being run down by a 2nd-level TV news reporter running down a story. The two tracks collide in a remarkable manner.  There are heart tugging stories of the White House staff, news reporting crews, intrepid astronauts, and a group of special neighbors, while millions flee the target area. Starring Morgan Freeman, Robert Duval,  Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Lili Sobieski, Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell, Laura Innes, Blair Underwood, Mary McCormack, Denise Crosby, and others. The soaring music score is orchestrated by James Horner. Directed by Mimi Leder. Lots of action, thrills, and tears. My Highest Recommendation. Four and a half INTENSE Stars! (Paramount studios. Rated PG-13. Color. HD. CC. Time 2:02. ShowtimeAnytime Amazon App.)",1407801600,,963,5.449664429530201

It was fun watching Robert Duvall chew the scenery in his role.  Maximillian Schell was good to, as the father who finally realizes what he has missed.  Morgan Freeman gives a fine performance in this pre Obama presidency, even if it is fictional.  But the comet is the true star of this movie.  The special effects are in my view, exceptional.  This film is well worth buying, for the fine acting, and the special effects.

133424,4,0792153189,"Enough from everyone else regarding the plot and opinions on acting, for this enjoyable popcorn movie.  I just review the quality of the transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray.

VIDEO....
  While I have the film on a Standard Def DVD, this is not a direct side by side comparison.  Never the less, the Blu Ray really is quite good.  Colors are true and skin tones very realistic with a reasonable amount of detailing throughout the film.  Contrast is very good and shows an improvement over the Standard Def version.  There is not a night and day difference between the two but a significant enough improvement of image appearance to upgrade.  At no time did I see any irregularities in the form of artifacts, annoying or crawling grain and no stair stepping either, especially in the wide angle shots where stair stepping would be more noticeable.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the low 30s.  This was one of the first of the Armageddon type movies that were all the rage during the period of time when this was made and some of the special fx, the comets themselves, do not appear to be too realistic by today's standards but one has to remember that CGI effects were very much in their infancy at that time.

 AUDIO...
  The audio, thankfully, is a lossless Dolby HD 5.1 codec which produces a very nice and transparent dialogue.  Levels were a touch lower than I usually need them to be so I upped the volume some and then all was fine.  No need to roller coaster your remote's volume once it is set.  Your LFE channel gets a real working out throughout most of the film and the surrounds, whlle largely unused for the first 40 minutes of story set up, then come into play nicely with an immersive effect.  There is some discreet use of the front and rear sides but for the most part the audio is evenly spread without a heck of a lot of directionality.

EXTRAS
  Aside for the typical commentary, there is one large making of documentary that is broken up into several parts, each with its own 'extra' title.  I did find them interesting and was surprised to learn that the director had also directed one of my favorite action flicks, 'The Peacemaker' with George Clooney and Nicole Kidman.

All of my reviews focus solely upon the quality of a Blu Ray's audio and video and I do hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.

It's a extinction-level event; an ""Ele"", as some unimaginative government official dubs it. But such a thing is hard to take in. Earth hasn't had one since the dinosaurs. So an MSNBC news reporter named Jenny Lerner carries on with her job, looking as lethargic as ever, as the end of the world grows near.

A decision she makes near that end is stupid, but it's the boy who discovered the comet while looking thru a telescope in astronomy class who's the ultimate idiot. His impeding doom is a secondary concern for him. He cares more about the classmate he's fallen in love with. Time wasted on such trivial silliness instead of more hardcore realism; The President addressing the nation are the best parts; cushions the blow with a layer of schmaltz.

However, since I was finally able to put the film into the proper perspective and rate it objectively myself, I finally did buy it.

Other raters have totally trashed the film because of its lack of ""realism.""  Please!  This is a work of fiction and while it could have been better in several of the sub-plots - much better in a couple, the story line itself was quite good.  Recent space-related events have shown that this situation is not only possible and plausible, but somewhere in the future it is probable.

I believe the most negative aspect of the film was, as several others have commented, was the casting of Tea Leoni, whose acting abilities are just - let us be kind here - ""questionable.""  Yes, she is a doll and she tries, but even in the plot where her boss eventually sat her at the news anchor position, of all places, this just would not happen in the very competitive TV news business.  The ratings would hit rock bottom.

The best part of the entire film was the incredibly touching ""Goodbyes"" enunciated by the astronauts who gave their lives for others.  Maybe I am too touched by such scenes, but they were very believable and superbly done.",1372377600,,1327,4.468879668049793

As disaster flicks go, this one is pretty sedate.  By sedate I mean dead slow, and weirdly calm.  Which automatically makes this a strange film.  It is, after all, about the proposed end of the world not a picnic in the park.  When Dr. Marcus Wolf (Charles Martin Smith) confirms the sighting of said comet by Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) he says, ""well hello there little fellow.  Where are you going in such a hurry?""  Then he dies.  A whole year later, we're introduced to a small handful of people and all their cares and woes.  It's a soap opera that doesn't amount to much; none of these chosen few is of much interest.  As the solemn and somber President (Morgan Freeman) tells the world, continue with your lives, pay your taxes.  Don't be the least bit insulted if we chose to save a couple elephants rather than a few kids.  Hello, giraffes are more important.  The rest of you poor slobs, take the easy way out, pull a Vanessa Redgrave, doll yourself up and die off screen.
Talk about a SERIOUS non-action flick!  They saved the good stuff for the last few minutes (too little too late).  Did Mimi Leder miss the primer on disaster flicks?  Did she doze off during the part about suspense?  Tension, panic, trepidation, all were missing from this thinking man's version of doomsday.  I had to dig pretty DEEP to find even a fraction of excitement in the plodding plot.

133451,4,0792153189,"There is really nothing to the Disaster when it strikes as compared to even B and C movies these days; even a TV budget stretches to stock film that does a better job than this one does. On the other hand, hackneyed though it may be, stories of people reacting to the  expectation of death does make for a Good if not a Very Good film. Most of it will be acceptable entertainment for the average viewer. A few of the ""stories"" which move the film along, make no particular sense, such as the one that begins the film. how the anchor-lady got her job. One gets the impression that it made up a substantial portion of the original book or script, but got chopped to nothing at all interesting by the time they got the film down to its final length. Most of the actors are serviceable in what they have to do,  with Morgan Freeman making an A-1 President (and looking too old to run for the real office) and Robert Duvall giving the space ship crew, which hopes to divert the death dealing comet, some class. I did not know that the surviving member of a notable British acting family had put  in an appearance until watching the closing cast credits.  Guessing game: what character did she play. All in all, sufficiently entertaining to warrant being the core of an evening at the TV without, I repeat, being a true disaster film.",1370217600,,1328,4.408163265306122
133452,5,0792153189,"With so many of the prior reviews doing such a good job reviewing this movie, I'd only like to add that this day, this particular crisis, will in fact present itself; it's only a matter of time.  While earlier epochs saw the bulk of interplanetary collisions, and today's inner solar system is swept largely clean of large impactors, there's most certainly still one out there with our name on it.

As an avid amateur astronomer, I was pleased at the role amateur astronomers played in both Deep Impact and Armageddon. And if you think about it, until very recently, there was no systematic survey of Earth-crossing interlopers, and most comets were the discoveries of amateurs. Subsequent to Gene Shoemaker's ground-breaking work (pun intended), and these two major motion pictures, Deep Impact and Armageddon, many people are aware, and government has taken notice, and has allocated ""some"" funds to study this.

What depresses me about this movie is that I have zero confidence that our leaders in Washington today, would have the competence, the honesty, or the grace depicted in Deep Impact.  Further, nothing like the technology in Deep Impact, or Armageddon for that matter, is at our disposal today.  And this apparently bothers almost nobody, exactly why?  Our long-term, assured survival, may very well depend on our having a solid presence in space.  The United States used to lead the world in space science.  Today, we hitch rides to and from a space station we sunk a fortune into.  Things have changed.

Deep Impact and Armageddon, their unreal political and technological portrayals aside, are important films in that they mark in space and time, our awareness of this extreme but real possibility, versus the short-sighted, instant-gratification mindset that so pervades society today.  An event unlikely in fifty years, may be inevitable five hundred, but does anybody really care?

This film is very nicely done, with great performances all around.  As to the awkwardness of some of the characters, we have a novice reporter that has managed to maneuver herself into a primetime anchor slot, reporting on the biggest story in history--and possibly the last.  And we have two children, too young to be married, choosing that option as a practical solution to a nightmare situation.  You know, I would expect ""awkward"".  I can hardly imagine...

133528,4,0792153189,"Gotta wonder what movie execs were thinking in the late Nineties.  (Frankly, you gotta wonder what movie execs are always thinking.)  DEEP IMPACT was released roughly the same time another comet calamity epic came out--the blue collar&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>.  Maybe these execs were expecting something to fall out of the sky other than screenplays and bonuses, but I digress.  Told basically from the point of view of a TV anchor (for sparsely-watched MSNBC, for goodness sake), DEEP IMPACT, for the most part, tenderly portrays the human race coming to grips with the ultimate Doomsday as a massive meteor hurtles through space towards the planet.  Led by a charismatic, determined president (Morgan Freeman is always solid), the masses look on as the government multi-tasks to attempt to alter the comet's orbit--and prepare a maze of underground tunnels where a computer-selected few will ride out the chaos of a post-apocalyptic world.  And when the NASA mission to change the comet's orbit goes awry, the masses run like rabbits for high ground.

Tea Leoni plays the journalist who ""breaks"" the story the Feds do not want made public--namely, there's a big rock coming.  And for me, this development took forever and a day to unfold, almost causing me to reach for the remote.  But once humanity is brought up to speed and the NASA crew is dispatched (with a subdued Robert Duvall playing the mission commander), DEEP IMPACT goes about its business telling, and subsequently wrapping up, several subplots, including the journalist's reconciliation with her estranged father (Maximilian Schell).  Another subplot includes a teen who garners some notoriety by ""discovering"" the meteor (Elijah Wood in his pre-Frodo days) desperately attempting to save his girl (Leelee Sobieski) and her family.  Finally, there is a very poignant moment when the NASA crew elects to pay the ultimate price by stopping the largest part of the rock, which has broken into two pieces.  *Spoiler alert!* And the effects, as the smaller piece actually crashes into the Atlantic, are spellbinding.  Yes, it's a tad too long, and takes too long to get going, yet once DEEP IMPACT focuses on the upcoming disaster and has its characters react accordingly, it becomes one very good End of World Epic.

The presumption being ""that something"" is a horrible upcoming event which will indeed happen to this nation, possibly this planet, necessitating the removal of our personal liberties.

So maybe all the terrible things FedGov is doing right now is in preparation for that event. If that's the case then I forgive you, FedGov.

133733,4,0792153189,"""Deep Impact"" is a very watchable disaster movie that is less about action and more about the character development. Like all disaster and sci-fi movies, there is the requirement to suspend disbelief to fully enjoy the movie.

No plot spoilers from me: The movie follows several characters as they react to news that a comet is heading on a collision course with earth. From the young high school amateur astronomer that makes an accidental discovery, a reporter that blunders into a big break and has a complex family life, an aging astronaut that has the fate of the world on his shoulders, to the president that has to decide how best to preserve our way of life, this is heavy on the drama and is even a bit of tear jerker.

The acting was better than average, with stars like Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, a young Elijah Wood, and Vanessa Redgrave. The special effects were good for a movie made in 1998 and hold up well.

Being a disaster/sci-fi movie fan I likely enjoyed the movie more than most might, but it is high on my lazy weekend movie list.

133784,5,0792153189,"After recently re-watching Deep Impact, I've come to the conclusion that it is a very overlooked filmed in terms of disaster movies.  Given that it came out within twelve months of Michael Bay's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon-Blu-ray/dp/B0036EH3TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon [Blu-ray</a>], audiences chose to spend their dollars on Bay's bigger budget and fancier special effects.  There has been a disturbing trend in disaster movies over the last decade, with each spending less time focusing on plot and realism and more on outdoing anything that has come before it.  For proof of this, look no further than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2012-Single-Disc-Version-Blu-ray/dp/B0032KNA4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2012 (Single Disc Version)  [Blu-ray</a>] or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After-Tomorrow-Blu-ray/dp/B000VDDWE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After Tomorrow [Blu-ray</a>].  Explosions and incredible scenes of destruction are to be expected with a film of this genre, but Deep Impact shows that it's still possible to include this without venturing too far out of the realm of possible and going simply for shock factor.

The film revolves around a teenage Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) who discovers an anomaly in the night sky which ultimately turns out to be a seven mile wide comet. Biederman's discovery, which would be exciting enough to any amateur astronomer, becomes even more relevant when it is discovered that his comet is on a collision course with Earth.  At this size, an impact anywhere on the planet would be enough to mirror the K-T Extinction and possibly cause the end of most life on the planet. The story focuses on the President's response to the comet, reporter Jenny Lerner's (Ta Leoni) scoop of the story and professional rise, the NASA team tasked with attempting to deflect its path, and Leo's relationship with his girlfriend (LeeLee Sobieski). While none of these stories really stand out and are all very weakly delivered (especially the relationship between Jenny and her father), they all play second billing to the real star - the Wolf-Biederman comet.  The best thing about Deep Impact is the developing suspense of the comet's impact and attempts to stop it.  With only some minor exceptions, I had very little difficulty believing everything in Deep Impact. No suspension of disbelief required (in stark contract to Armageddon).  There are a few cringe-worthy moments, such as a couple waiting patiently for a tsunami to overtake them, as well as much of Leoni's acting, however for the most part, Deep Impact is a very plausible look at what an extinction-level scenario could be.  The image of the comets in space and entering earth's atmosphere are amazing and even more so when these 14-year old effects are viewed against much of the images being put out in Hollywood today.

Although I do think the film could have been improved with some slight casting changes, eliminating the ""I hate my father"" story, and a more hardened look at what humans would do in the actuality of such a situation (ala more looting, violence, and self-preservation), I still think Deep Impact holds up over a decade later as one of the best disaster movies in the genre and a great popcorn flick.

ABOUT THE BLU-RAY RELEASE:

The blu-ray release has a decent 2.39:1 aspect ratio with acceptable video quality, although the colors don't ""pop"" as much as I would like and it could use a little more cleaning up.  But overall, perfectly acceptable for a movie of this age and I was impressed with the clarity.  The audio does a much better job, with a Dolby TrueHD audio codec that sounds great on my 5.1 system.  The audio is well-adjusted and I never had to race for the volume button on my remote.  It only contains a few featurettes which weren't very exciting and didn't add much to the release. I really would have liked to have seen some interviews with astrophysicists about the likelihood of an actual extinction level event or comet hitting Earth, as this is what everyone is going to be wondering after seeing this film.  While the Blu_Ray release is fairly decent, it definitely could have used a 4 minute interview with Neil DeGrasse Tyson.",1325116800,6,4351,5.447916666666667

The themes of family, forgiveness, courage and self-sacrifice are inspiring. A giant meteor, big enough to cause catastrophic damage and death to most of the Earth, is headed on a collision course with our planet. Plans are put into place to preserve our society and attempt to divert the galactic missile before impact.
A departure from the standard Hollywood approach, when disaster is looming (initial attempts to destroy the meteor have failed), the president (Morgan Freeman) appears on TV to inform the citizens what to expect, and at the end of his speech he offers Judeo-Christian comfort and peace.

He says, ""I wish"" then he stops himself and says ""No, wishing is wrong. That is not what I meant. I believe in God. I know many of you don't, but I want to offer a prayer for our survival, mine included."" He then goes on to give the Levitical Blessing:

It's realistic and it's effects look great even today.  This would have been better served though if it hadn't come out the same year as the other flick.  Still this is a drama played so straight that some people hated it, I didn't; the story is believable under the circomstances, although the biggest disaster that's happening now is the polluting of the world to pieces probably, this is doomsday sped up and of course some people would survive the disaster. YOu have top actors like Robert DUvall on board too and that helps.

133811,5,0792153189,"Deep Impact and Armageddon release dates were close together, but differently revealing the possibility of impending doom. Although Armageddon was most entertaining and fun, Deep Impact was a slap of reality that dug deep into the personal lives of heroes and victims, not to mention a planet on the verge of total destruction.

The graphics effects of both movies were outstanding, but those of Deep Impact, again, were made believable by the interjection of so many lives touched by an impending disaster.

The purpose of casting Morgan Freeman as President of the US escapes me, unless the producers wanted us to think that ""this is just a movie, not reality."" If that was their motive, they failed. Freeman made it even more real to us, as he appeared very Presidential. His familiar face made the movie an even more future possibility.

The Bible speaks of a future disaster like the one depicted in Deep Impact, created by a meteor named Wormwood. It speaks of one third of mankind dying in the wake of its power.

133814,3,0792153189,"Whereas Armageddon focused more on action and comedy, Deep Impact's main concern was drama. This film was released two months before Armageddon, and was more well-received by critics. The audience, however, preferred Armageddon a bit more, which resulted in its higher box-office performance. Deep Impact didn't rely too much on special effects or Hollywood-style action, but it did concentrate on the human elements of the story. The plot is thicker, and the drama is more compelling. But sometimes it can be too compelling, as some scenes look like they come from a daytime soap opera. A few dialogue moments are as silly as the ones found in Armageddon, but at least they are written more carefully.

Like I said, the special effects aren't very important in Deep Impact. They are, however, pretty spectacular. The Wolf-Biederman comet looks good, and scenes involving outer space in general look beautiful. The giant tsunami scene near the end of the film can be really intensely riveting as we see the devastating destruction right in front of our eyes.

The performances are good, the special effects are impressive, and the drama is fairly convincing. So why am I giving this the same grade as with Armageddon? Well, beside some silly dialogue moments, I did find a few pretensions in the drama. There weren't much, but some can be very obvious. Plus, I did find Elijah Wood and Tea Leoni to be a bit unmoving. Their performance didn't affect me very much, and I personally found them to be uncomfortable to look at sometimes. And finally, some scenes in the movie did tend to drag. It's two hours long, but it does feel like an extra thirty minutes had been added in.

In the end, both Deep Impact AND Armageddon aren't great films. Armageddon is an overproduced action film with some filler action scenes, second-rate dialogue, and an unnecessary romance between Ben Affleck & Live Tyler. Deep Impact, on the other hand, is a fairly pretentious human drama with some mediocre performances, some silly dialogue, and several slow-moving scenes. Both films aren't very good, but they're certainly not bad, either. Both have great special effects, good action, and good drama. Still, I give both of these films a C. They're pretty much adequate, but they're still very watchable.

Granted, the thing between the kids didn't do much for me, but the overall situation where the impending doom forced the government to choose 1 million people and no one over 50 would be included... That in itself was a lot. The desperation of surviving an event that could very well happen for real knowing there is nothing we can actually do; not even having a ship as portrayed in the movie, is really alarming.
The film was well made. Yes, Hollywood was all over it, but it was a disaster movie unlike any I have seen. And I have seen many. Oh, and a Black president! who knew? This trend was then followed by the series 24, and then by our real lives. But enough of that.

One other aspect of this film is it's attempt to scare you with science.  What better way to create a feeling of dread than to be as factual as you can and I think this is apparent in her film and greatly enhances the impact as the film draws to it's moving closure.  Of course not everything in the film matches up to proper physics, but the imperfections are minor and as previously stated we as an audience are far more interested in the fate of the characters as we grow to care for  them and every scene where we see them having to make life or death decisions rings true.

This film shows how not to make a claptrap disaster movie driven only by big budget special effects.  Make your characters believable so you can empathise with them.

I've seen this film several times now and I never cease to be stirred, excited, and moved by it. The writing and characterizations have unusual depth for a big studio, big budget disaster movie, and the acting is uniformly excellent, with several performances -- Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvaal, Vanessa Redgrave, Tea Leoni, and Maximilian Schell -- being especially memorable.

Yes, it has some of the elements of soap opera and melodrama and yet manages, somewhat miraculously, to transcend them in its overall effect.

With the exception of Robert Duvall driving his ship into the tail of the comet a la Bo and Luke Duke - and some unnecessary orchestration to support some mawkish personal stories, this film holds up very well as Science Fiction, with a great story, great characters, and y tastefully programmed action - there is absolutely no violence in any scene: through intelligent editing, we watch the tidal wave from a distance.
Morgan Freeman as The President is superb; so is Robert Duvall, as the ""Old-Timer"" who has a bit of a struggle unifying his team of astronauts, who want their *own* glory. Tea Leoni is perfect as the aggressive Cable News Anchor. Her reaction is memorable when her Boss admonishes her not to withhold a story from him - little did he know.",1229904000,,887,4.620253164556962

The difference between Armageddon and Deep Impact is that Deep Impact is a comet, and also that there's a year and a half between finding out about the comet, before something is sent up to destroy the comet. Armageddon is based over a period of 18 days? Something like that. I did feel that Deep Impact was a lot slower paced than Armageddon, and the first half of the movie is deliberately slow it seems, but then it seems all rushed towards the end.

The cast do mostly well, but not Elijah Wood. Another of my least favourite actors. He just cannot act in my opinion.

There's quite a few sad scenes in this including the estranged and his daughter, coming together and admitting some truths to each other, along the lines of ""I stole $32 from your wallet"" and ""I dropped you on your head as a child"". Which prompted my dad to tell me that it put me on his shoulders (when I was still small enough to do that) and smacked my head off the bus stop sign. That explains all my problems. The simple scenes with Morgan Freeman (playing the president) and his moving words.

These kind of movies always get to me. I mean, what would you do if extinction was just around the corner? I think when Armageddon first came out at the cinema, I cracked up for a couple of days afterwards, thinking that something like that was going to happen for real. These films always have the same effect (Day After Tomorrow was another memorable one), although I try to push it out of my head as quickly as possible, cos I think I would go stir crazy.

I didn't really feel for any of the characters in the first half of the movie. I was basically ticking off the different ways they could die. But it's the second half the film really comes into its own. There's all the sob stories, the underage marriage, the estranged dad, etc. The marriage between Elijah and Leelee Sobieski's characters nearly broke my heart, as I felt that something was going to happen to them. But their story did feel slightly rushed, and apparently some of their scenes were left on the cutting room floor, due to poor response from test audience. How? I think the film would have benefited from more of their story.

Armageddon will probably always overshadow Deep Impact in terms of storyline, effects and big name stars. And although I love Armageddon (I've seen it so many times), Deep Impact, apart from the very slow start, was still good. I'll heartily disagree with all the bad reviews.

I can honestly say that Deep Impact is much better than Armaggedon. Armaggedon just has people landing on a meteor then blowing it up. There's much more to Deep Impact than just that. Both movies have great effects, but Deep Impact still passes it up. The special effects are just amazing! (especially where the meteor hits the water and makes a big tidal wave) It's simply an outstanding movie.

Its not just some big rock hitting earth and killing a lot of people. That sort of comment should be beneath anyone who represents amazon. The truth is, the meteor is discovered about a year's travel from earth. At first, a coverup while the government decides what to do about it. The press find out (as they always do) and the world as a whole is forced to deal with the situation. The movie goes from executing three plans for survival each heart wrenchingly realistic. This isn't a silly bunch of oil diggers being sent up by NASA-- as was the case in the ridiculously far-fetched Armageddon-- this is a movie steeped in fact!

Robert Duvall and Tea Leoni in a movie about a comet on a collision path with the Earth.  An ambitious reporter is investigating what she thinks is a Washington sex scandal when she accidently discovers that E.L.E. is not a girl's name.  A comet is coming to earth and it's not going to stay for supper.

The most outstanding line IMHO in this movie is ""I know you're a reporter, but you used to be a human being.""

133895,5,0792153189,"I realize that I am a few years late in offering this review.  But, I still enjoy this movie very much.  When it first came out at the cinemas, I saw it 4 or 5 times, which is probably a record for me.
Why did I love this movie?  Perhaps the main reason is that I love astronomy and I know that a comet could, indeed, hit our small planet with dire consequences.  Second, I loved the ""realism"" of the acting and script.  Third, I loved the music score by James Horner.  It was much better than the score to ""Titanic.""  Fourth, I loved the photography.  Did anyone notice how often the camera focused on ""hands?""  This movie is an essay in ""hand signals.""  For example, a slight twitch of the fingers by Morgan Freeman (the president of the US, here) was enough to demonstrate the anguish within him.  Fifth, I like movies that deliver on the emotional level, rather than movies that are entirely centered on action, blood, and guts.  There are so many genuinely tragic moments in this film that it was hard to keep my feelings held within.
If I must list a negative aspect of this film, it would be that the portion of the film in which the astronauts are getting ready for their mission is too long and somewhat boring.  Perhaps much of this footage could have been cut.
Otherwise, this was a great movie, in my estimation.",1202860800,2,1324,4.377049180327869
133896,3,0792153189,"I lack the scientific wherewithal to speak to the scientific accuracy of this film, but I do know a little something about Virginia Beach, having lived in this area for most of my life.

There's a scene in the movie where Elijah Wood and his sweet thing are running past a sign that says ""Virginia Beaches, 6 miles"" yet in fact there is no such place. Virginia Beach is singular and all the signs I've ever seen leading to the oceanfront say, ""Oceanfront, 6 miles"". But that's not my point here.

We seen that sign in the background just about the moment that the comet strikes the ocean. And then between the time the comet strikes and the moment the massive tidal wave comes to shore, we see Elijah and Sweet Thing going up the mountainside.

Those mountains, replete with pines and evergreens, appear to be the mountains of the Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains which are more than 200 miles from Virginia Beach. It's going to be mighty tough to get from the oceanfront to the Blue Ridge in the amount of time a tidal wave can travel from the ocean front to a few miles inland.

Then there's the scene where the guys in the spaceship are chasing the comet in space. They're flying into the comet's tail, and the space ship is taking a lot of abuse because of it. Watching that scene and knowing NOTHING about spaceships, I had to think, ""Why not fly alongSIDE the comet and avoid the debris field?""

Lastly, the scenes of people's response to the news that the world was ending was not believable. We all want to think we'd be big and brave, but I doubt that we'd go about ""business as usual"" until a few hours before the world ended. I suspect there'd be chaos, even with the subtle hope that the comet's direction could *maybe* be altered with nuclear missles.

Thinking about my own life, I'd grab my dear husband and all the canned goods I could fit in my trunk and head up to those secret hiding places, high in the hills of his native home, West Virginia. I'd make this trek a LOOONG time before the last days of earth, mainly because I wouldn't want to die on westbound I-64, just as the movie depicted. (I guess that was I-64, which is THE road from Virginia Beach to the Blue Ridge.)

I surely wouldn't wait until the last minute to see how things went.

All that aside, I have to wonder about the rest of the science in this movie.

One last comment, I agree with other reviewers that the Tea Leoni was not believable as an anchor. However, the scene at the very end, where she and her father embraced and then braced for the end, was very touching.

Three stars for good acting and great actors and for the good sense to put Morgan Freeman in the lead role as President. Let's write him in on the next ticket! Morgan Freeman for president!!!",1201996800,2,2753,4.4015748031496065
133897,4,0792153189,"I strongly disagree with the Amazon Editorial review written by David Chute.

For a film that is now a decade old, Deep Impact still proves to be a powerful, topical film driven by emotion rather than special effects. Granted, it's not perfect. In fact, some viewers will guess several of the plot twists long before they arrive. Predictability and flaws aside, it's still an emotional journey worth taking. Deep Impact is one of the better films of its genre, and is certainly far more enjoyable than ""Armageddon"", the film it is most often compared to.

If you enjoy your disaster pictures with an emphasis on character depth, I highly recommend Deep Impact. If all your looking for is a special effects driven action flick, then look elsewhere.

Our government decides We the People are too stupid and brutish to be trusted to act responsibly with that knowledge, and they use billions of our tax dollars to build a massive shelter for favored citizens, all with great secrecy, with a few remaining slots to be rationed out to the taxpayers via lottery.

The catastrophe wasn't as bad as anticipated, and had the U.S. government not decided to use our tax dollars as their personal piggy bank to provide an ""ark"" for politicians and their families and friends, individual citizens could have built shelters or made other provisions that might likely have let them survive the disastrous strike that sent a massive tidal wave surging halfway across the country.

The real disaster was that millions of U.S. citizens died, but all the politicians were saved.  Yeah, that's what I want when it's time to rebuild civilization:  the privileged political class ready to resume Big Government As Usual.  Ugh!

Of course, the movie was fiction.  The bunkers our government has built for themselves and not us, those are real.

It starts off pretty well and ends moderately well, but the entire middle is BORING.  It's very hard to care about any of the characters, most of whom seem to be doing everything they can to be shallow idiots, if not totally brain dead.  Their scripted actions are, in many cases, directly opposite to the real actions of people in disasters, such as we have seen in the World Trade Center or in the 2006 tsunami.  Perhaps that is an observation from hind sight, since this movie was made long before we had such disasters to judge it by.

The one real person in the entire cast is Morgan Freeman as the President of the US. The worst is Tea Leoni, who sleepwalks through the picture.

As for the destruction of NYC, that is pretty good, much better than in some of the other disaster movies I have seen (""Fourth of July"", ""Day After Tomorrow"", etc.).

Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall save this film from being an utter turkey, but only by a slight margin.

Unlike many Hollywood movie about disasters, this film is largely based on the humanity angle: what would you do if a large percentage of life, maybe even all life, will be wiped out in a short amount of time? Sure Armageddon had it but let's face it: it was melodramatic cheese trying to pass itself off as carrying real emotion. While there is some trouble spots, this film is different in that it's geared primarily towards the human side of a crisis and it works better.

A simple Astronomy club meeting has young Leo Biederman discovering something odd in the sky, and Dr. Wolf, an Observatory worker makes it official: they found a comet. Problem is, it's heading for Earth. One year later, a reporter named Jenny Lerner accidentally stumbles across the story and she becames the world's link to the crisis. And so we follow several storylines from Leo's love for another girl, Jenny's familial problems and the astronauts sent to destroy the comet.

For those of you looking for action heavy stuff, it mainly has 2 key scenes: the astronauts' mission to nuke the comet and when one of them smacks into the Atlantic Ocean creating a massive tidal wave. While these are admittedly cool scenes, they're not the main reason to see the film and since the focus is on human reaction to impending death, they might seem out of place but it helps makes the story become a bit more epic and larger scale. The one thing though is that they're slightly ineptly directed, especially the wave sequence, where the scenes don't really register since they go by a bit too quickly or there's too much going on in one shot.

As for the cast, they're quite good and manage to be interesting in their roles. Morgan Freeman, aside from Martin Sheen, is probably the best President on screen, managing to be charismatic and leader-like while also having a commanding presence. Tea Leoni doesn't really have the greatest range but there's something likable about her. And always wonderful Robert Duvall has his trademark enthusiasm where even while mad, it doesn't come across as overly vicious.

The special features are very disappointing. This so-called Collector's Edition only really has about 4 featurettes and a commentary. Would've been nice if more stuff was included but as it stands it's the movie that makes it worthy of a purchase.",1162857600,8,2353,4.802469135802469

Out of the hundreds of films that I have watched in my lifetime, of every stripe and quality, this is the first one that was so utterly vapid and feeble-minded that I began fast-forwarding through simply so that I could see the meteor hit and make the big wave. If this film were a sexual encounter, both partners would have fallen asleep during the foreplay.

Life is far too precious to waste on this skanky turtle of a film.",1154131200,9,642,4.478632478632479
133919,4,0792153189,"After a number of viewings I have decided to share my thoughts on this one.  Deep Impact was not reviewed very favorably when it came out but I think most of that the reviewers missed something.

A comet is discovered that is on a collision course with Earth.  That the government is aware of it and keeping that the public unaware while it spends big money on countermeasures.  A reporter accidentally stumbles onto that the story and pushes up that the date for public awareness.  A complex capable of housing one million people has been built underground.  A joint US/Russia project is building a rocket to travel to that the comet, plant nuclear warheads and blow that the comet to bits.  A back-up plan calls for a massive titan missile strike to change that the comet's path.

That the nukes are buried one-hundred yards into that the surface of that the seven-mile comet (a bit shallow if you ask me) and only result in blowing a piece off making two comets out of one.  Both will impact Earth.  That the Titan missile strike also fails.  All that is left is for those selected to make it into that the bunkers before that the impact.

That the first, and smaller, piece hits in that the Atlantic creating a tidal wave that reaches that the Ohio Valley.  But that the second piece does not hit.  That the surviving astronauts locate a vent deep enough that blowing their remaining nukes should destroy that the comet.  Their plan works and that the Earth is not completely destroyed.

Sounds like it could make a good action film but it doesn't.  That the comet is really secondary to that the plot.  That the real plot is imminent destruction and how people handle it.  Several families are highlighted and even a broken family makes peace to face that the end together.  In this respect that the movie excelled.  I have watched a lot of disaster films and seen plenty of people die in them but this one was different.  I am not ashamed to say that I had tears in my eyes for much of that the ending.  That is that the true deep impact of this movie.

On another level you can see some excellent performances.  Morgan Freeman does an excellent job playing that the President.  While he does not inspire me to go out and vote for him (as was that the case in Independence Day) I would like our leaders to show as level a head as he did.  Tea Leoni was pretty much what you would expect from her television show.  But that the best performance came from Robert Duval (no surprise there) as an aging astronaut and that the last man to walk on that the moon.  How he handled that the young hotshots and took command was one of that the finer bits of acting I have seen in a long time.  That the scenes where that the astronauts get one last chance to see their families before they make that the ultimate sacrifice was one of that the most touching and emotional I have ever seen.  So see Deep Impact but not for that the comet.",1153612800,5,2932,4.414179104477612

""Deep Impact"" manages to succeed where the others fail. The movie feels rather somber in tone which gives the gravity of the situation its weight.

Two astronomy students debate the name and type of an object in space while on a star gazing trip. Unbeknownst to both, it turns out to be a comet hurdling in a destructive path towards Earth. As the dire nature of the circumstance takes over the planet, the viewer witnesses relationships breaking, relationships mending and heart wrenching realizations about mortality among other seemingly authentic life happenstances. The movie's special effects are breathtaking, especially scenes of a large comet fragment crashing in the Atlantic Ocean and its ensuing destruction. As a side note, this movie was made well before September 11, 2001 and I must say, knowing that the World Trade Center was essentially destroyed by fire, it's odd and rather poignant to see it engulfed by water.

Many of the actors are distinguished however their performances are hit and miss. Tea Leoni, who I enjoy in other movies, seems oddly out of place as the reporter who breaks the story of Earth's possible destruction. Morgan Freeman, who never seems to give a bad performance, plays the President of the Unites States and he's very effective. He just exudes authority (see the interaction between his character and Tea Leoni's in what I believe is the White House cellar). Robert Duvall, who is one of Hollywood's most respected actors, surprisingly lacks passion. Most of the remaining cast's performances are adequate to fine.

All in all, I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable.",1144713600,4,1819,5.076923076923077

133925,5,0792153189,"One of the greatest disaster movies of all time - on par with ""Titanic"" and ""Dante's Peak"" - ""Deep Impact"" centers on the real-life possibility of a comet on a collision course with Earth, something that's happened before in the distant past and could happen again in the future.  What's highly important about the premise is that, this time around, it's handled realistically - from the public reaction to the desperate attempts to find some way, any way, to stave off the inevitable, to the government's attempts to conceal their knowledge of the looming collision behind a wall of secrecy.  Even more impressive is that the filmmakers have pulled all this off simultaneously with a movie that views humanity and its behavior in its darkest hour in a surprisingly optimistic light, even including the 'secretive governments', who usually come off very badly in this sort of movie scenario.  Whether or not things would play out this way in terms of people's actions is impossible to say, but it's a refreshing path for the movie to take compared to the usual all-out chaos erupting.  Interstingly, many of the brightest and most hopeful parts of ""Deep Impact"" are what have turned many off the movie: the acts of genuine altruism in the most terrifying circumstances, the reunion of estranged loved ones during the final days before the comet's impending arrival, etc.

  A last-ditch effort is indeed made to divert the comet using a space shuttle frantically armed during the last few months before the news of the collision course went public, an astronaut crew of crack experts and spaceflight veterans and an unproven, untested plan that's all anybody could come up with in what, relative to the complexity of the task, is extremely short notice.  Whether the exact mechanics of the plan and certain effects would be technically feasible is, I suppose, debateable, but it comes off as far more plausible than some other movies of this nature; accurate 95% of the time and when it arguably misses, it's in the details, not in a huge gaping hole in logic.

  Visually awesome and dramatically moving, with great performances from Morgan Freeman, Tea Leoni, Robert Duvall, and, really, the whole ensemble cast.  Cerebral, thrilling and usually highly believable; a credit to the disaster genre.",1136419200,8,2298,5.002624671916011

133928,4,0792153189,"Art houses and college film courses sometimes use a theme along the lines of ""Overlooked Films,"" movies that were not warmly received by either the critics or the public but deserve a better fate. This movie epitomizes that class.

Often after a movie like this one has screened, the decent common folk exiting the theater will think they've just seen a pretty good yarn. But the ""intelligentsia"" -- like amazon's lead reviewer above -- will hate it. True, this film is pure Hollywood, but in the best sense: a taut and economical script, stock characters we can't help but come to care about, and a carefully contrived ending that packs an emotional wallop. The ""cultural elite"" and 2nd-year grad students can go watch ""Persona,"" myself, I'll curl up with a large popcorn and coke and allow myself to just enjoy the show!

This was Dreamworks first release, and Spielberg's populist fingerprints are all over this. It was also Mimi Leder's first theatrical direction, and it benefits from her TV commercial training, bringning a disciplined, unpretentious eye. The acting is uniformly solid, Morgan Freeman is splendid as the President who must preside over the Apocalypse.

If there is a weakness in Deep Impact, it's Tea Leoni in the lead role, who seems a bit detached (dare I say, ""stoned""?), although she does manage to help drive the plot along. Veterans such as Robt Duvall, Max Schell, and Lynn Redgrave earn their salaries.

The film ultimately succeeds because in the end it manages to lift the human pathos of a worldwide disaster above the ""wow"" special effects, a difficult assignment. They may be hokey to the intelligentsia, but the timeless qualities of heroism, devotion to family, and self sacrifice for the good of others are the stuff that make for moving drama; there is actually something to be learned from this movie.

133931,3,0792153189,"Whether Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones is our best black president (both have now played one) is a tossup. Freeman may have the edge. There's real gravitas behind his gravity, and his oratory in the oval office is splendid. In a crisis, either actor is preferable to the current occupant, and there's certainly a crisis looming in ""Deep Impact."" A comet is on a dead reckoning to obliterate Earth and astronauts are enroute to blow it up.

If you think you've seen this movie before, you have (""Armageddon,"" ""On the Beach,"" ""Meteor""), but you haven't seen it done this badly. In addition to Robert Duvall, as an astronaut, James Cromwell, Vanessa Redgrave and Maximillian Schell appear in throwaway parts, yet their parts are the ones you don't want thrown away. Mimi Leder has no clue how to direct them. Every scene with Tea Leoni, as a TV reporter-turned-anchor, needs to be reshot with a real actress.

As the world awaits doomsday, with the attendant geopolitical run-up to it, there is compelling potential in how humanity will cope. What a picture that might make in this age of CGI, starry casts and Steven Spielberg (who, unfortunately, only produced here.) Instead, the script is interested in teenage romance, families torn apart, panic in the streets, and how MSNBC reports the news (other networks don't exist here.) If MSNBC thought ""Deep Impact"" was a promotional coup, it is certainly having second thoughts now.

There are three compensations. A pre-Frodo Elijah Wood gets his first grown-up screen kiss. Freeman can deliver the silliest of lines with such sincerity he really should run for office. And Duvall has a few moving moments chatting with a blinded astronaut. But the movie exudes understated self-importance.

In much the same manner as the Bruce Willis outing, ""Deep Impact"" concerns the advent of a comet strike upon our planet. But rather than focus on two hours of lame comedy and cliched action, Director Mimi Leder instead gives us a moving portrait of real people who are forced to confront an unthinkable reality. Morgan Freeman gives a standout performance as our nation's President, and is but one member of an exceptionally strong cast of actors this film has to offer.

I invested emotionally in each and every one of the characters, and that is a rare occurence for me. The seamless fusion of large-scale devastation and raw heartfelt drama is what really sets this production apart from all the other disaster movies that have since come down the pike.

This movie makes Jan De Bont (Twister), Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow) and Paul W.Anderson (Alien vs Predator) look like the greatest and most inspiring moviemakers in the world today - now I'm being sarcastic of course, but it should indeed draw you the picture of how awful Deep Impact is!

I mean; I expected patriotism to some level (as if US is the only part of the world worth saving, or in this case even give a ""warning"" - they didn't know where the metheor would strike did they?) , more effects than story, good acting because of the talented and legendary cast (though my expectations weren't high considering the usual outcome of scripts from similar movies about nature-catastrophes striking parts of the earth, and all the usual heroism and moral-speeches about sacrificing one life to save a million and all that), and at least parts of the story to be ""believable"". Not a chanse. One thing is that the effects are so not realistic, the movie clearly is a movie made only to make money. There's no joy, no thought, no inspiration behind Deep Impact.

No excuse for Morgan Freeman to waste his talent on yet another ""turkey"", the same goes for Robert Duvall. Didn't they read the script before practising their lines? The president character surely ment to present the US in some idealistic way is just annoying, and do not get me wrong here - I would have nothing against a black president ""over"" there, in fact I'm looking forward to it! But why put so much moral and drama into such an ""over the top""-movie. There's some of it in The Day After Tomorrow, but it's not nearly as embarrasing as it gets in Deep Impact!

As mentioned; the story is totally unbelievable. It's like a child wrote the script. Or even better; some stupis father was inspired to make the movie after watching his child play with its' toys. For two years the metheor is raging through the universe, and no one knows about it exept for the president and his staff. Like they're the only nation in the world with equiptment (wrong spelled?). It's kept secret to spend money building some kind of a spaceship to land on the metheor, and then to place a bomb on it? Something like that, I nearly fell asleep.

And when finally the metheor strikes the ocean somewhere near New York, the best part (haha), the entire nation being warned since long and there's been a countdown for the impact -well, only a few of the people has been evacuated, and when the wave flows in over the buildings people are walking around or driving in their cars like as if it was an ordinary day, and the disaster comes sudden!

133957,5,0792153189,"Immersed in the purest tradition of the disaster films category that literally covered a wide spectrum in the American cinematography of the early seventies (From Airport, The Towering Inferno, Poseidon Adventure and Earthquake among the most representatives) the story maintains certain force due the intriguing of the script. A comet recently discovered will collapse unavoidably with the Earth unless the mankind made something for avoiding it. In this order of ideas, the picture runs for three different movements. The initial drama in which the President of the United States will inform to the citizens and the rest of the world about the imminent fact and the personal ethic conflict of the female journalist. The second Movement concerns with the mission itself, the presentation to the Press and the encountered feelings of the members of the mission with Robert Duvall as the most experienced of them: Excellent cynicism when Duvall answers them: "" It's not a video game"". Finally the long Third Movement presents in its own a ""Theme with Variations"" . the breakthrough of the expectations when the mission fails despite all the efforts. Personally I found this sequence something cold in its dramatic resolution: it lacked emotion , the second variation is the reiterate Presidential message announcing the failure and the explanation for this neo Darwinian selection process of the one million human beings considered to live during two years in a modern Noah's Arc in an underground city built in Missouri caverns, the dramatic sequences derived as a natural consequence of the imminent collision will interweave all the secondary lines with absolute veracity.

Additionally you will be invited to presence an admirable cast with Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell in little roles but so convincing and well portrayed , Tea Leoni is surprising in her role she is nowadays one of the ten most beautiful actress in the world and makes a worthy performance but in the case of Robert Duvall to my mind, was wasted in an insignificant role. Duvall is much more than a great actor; he is a living legend and his stature by itself did not deserve that treatment.

ARMAGEDDON is a meteorite disaster flick from a guy's point of view.  The underdog rascals are sent into space to destroy the meteorite after much testosterone antics and posturing.  The chick (Liv Tyler) is hot.  It's a cowboy enterprise.

DEEP IMPACT is the same movie but from a woman's point of view.  The world is about ready to end, but Tea Leoni tries to come to grips with her troubled relationship with her dad.  People hug, make sacrifices, deal with emotions.

This movie was profoundly dissappointing.  I would give them a F minus for the extreme blunders in the science.

The movie begins with a high school boy with unaided eye in Virgina Beach, VA noticing a strange star that is actually the comet and asking his teacher about it.  What?????  Where are the world's professionals?  There are thousands of people world wide who search the skies with good telescopes for comets, hoping to find one so they can get it named after them.  And a boy at sea-level, looking up through the entire atmosphere, in a light polluted area, is the first to see it?

The astronomer freaks out when his computer shows a projected impact with earth, his ISp is down, so he and races in his vehicle down the mountain so fast that he has an accident?  What's the big rush?  It won't hit for over a year and a half.  He can simply telephone, or wait a bit for the ISP to come back up.

The USA gov't keeps it secret for over a year???  No leaks??  No one else in the world ever looks up???

A manned spacecraft with only a few nukes to destroy the comet?  Cheaper and better chance of success to send several smaller automated ships with lots of nukes.

There is a scene where an astronaut is on the comet's head and is jumping up and down on a stuck probe to free it.  But he should be in microgravity and will only weight as much as a feather.

And the stupidity continued in scene after scene.

Armeggedon was stupid too, but it didn't pretend to take itself seriously.  I viewed it as a kind of comedy so I don't come down so hard on it.",1101427200,9,1731,4.283950617283951
133960,4,0792153189,"Yet another variation on the ""we're all doomed"" philosophy that Hollywood en masse loves to embrace ""Deep Impact"" is the story of how various people (all from the United States) cope with the imminent disaster of being wiped off the face of the planet. It stars Tea Leoni as Jenny Lerner; a precocious White House reporter who accidentally stumbles across secret information about a natural disaster of cataclysmic proportions.  It seems that earth is in direct line with a giant asteroid. If the asteroid strikes earth, it will bring about the next ice age. Maximilian Schell (Jason) and Vanessa Redgrave (Robin) costar as Jenny's divorced feuding parents. Because no one over the age of forty is being considered for the massive rescue and life preservation effort that is sweeping the country (presumably because future society won't require any intelligence, just a host of sexy youth to help in the procreation phase of mankind volume 2) Robin decides to take her own life. This makes the riff between Jenny and her father almost unbearable. Meanwhile, on another part of the continent young astronomer, Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) is preparing to take refuge in the woods of California to save himself and his girlfriend, Sarah (Leelee Sobieski) from certain death. Finally, there's Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), a NASA man and widower who's been pulled out of retirement to front a space mission which will attempt to blow up the asteroid in outer space before it reaches the earth.

Director, Mimi Ledger is unequal to the task of formulating a cohesive narrative from these bits of life in peril. Instead we're treated to incredibly sappy moments of melodrama which, rather than tugging at our heart strings, serve as glaring reminders of just how awful this sort of disaster epic can be in less skilled hands. There's no consistency to the plot, just bits of chaos buttressed by a lot of tears and some really poor acting. Only Morgan Freeman escapes the deluge of B-movie oblivion, as the very Presidential voice of reason. As though a happy ending confirms some vain attempt at the life affirming message that ""we shall overcome"", Ledger's flick ends on a high note that reads more like a tack on than an exaltation of the human spirit.

Paramount's previous DVD was not anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions and I imagine if you're a fan of the film, this is the primary selling feature of this Special Edition reissue. There's also an audio commentary on this edition in which director Leder sounds rather bored by the experience. Three all too brief featurettes that superficially cover the production of the film round out the extras. As for the overall picture quality of the film on this disc - it appears to be the idental image quality as the previous transfer. Colors are vibrant and rich. Black and contrast levels are quite deep and solid. There's a considerable amount of film grain during some sequences while the space segments betray their blue screen and computer compositing by being overly smooth and perfect. The final sequence of this film must have been the inspiration for Roland Emmerich's misguided weather channel disaster epic, ""The Day After Tomorrow."" The audio on ""Deep Impact"" is 5.1 Dolby Digital and delivers an aggressive sound field that will surely give your speakers a work out.",1096502400,10,3342,4.996409335727109
133961,3,0792153189,"Of all of the disaster flicks out there, I'd have to rank ""Deep Impact"" in the top five.  Why?  Because it makes a good effort at making the viewer feel for the characters involved.  So many of these films are driven by their special effects that the story is left behind in the cosmic dust.  Why then, did I give it only three stars?  For the simple fact that the film does seem to drag along too much for my tastes.  Also, the relationship between Elijah Wood and Lelee Sobieskie isn't that believable.  I understand why they got married, but I just don't ""feel the love"" between these two.

Rober Duvall turns in a good performance as the ""old guy"" sent off to destroy the comet of death with a bunch of hotshot astronauts.  There is a comaraderie between all of the astronauts(and the one cosmonaut) that makes you hope that they pull through this ordeal.  Back on Earth, Tea' Leoni's character is a dead-on representation of a nosey reporter who lets her imagination turn loose in an attempt to gain glory on the television.  The rest of the cast is also very good.

If you're looking for a character-driven end-of-the-world flick, this film is for you.  It doesn't have quite the action that a movie like ""The Core"" has, but it's science is a lot more believable.  I recommend for an evening at home.

Unlike most disaster epics, ""Deep Impact"" is character driven. I think this is a direct effect of its having been directed by a woman rather than a man. While the special effects are there and are impressive, what drives this film are the emotions of the excellent ensemble cast. All of them ring true, from the occasional duplicitousness of the government bureaucrats, to the real tear jerking moments of those facing tough life and death decisions, to the small intimate moments. It's powerful enough stuff that I have to believe that a lot of the negative reaction the film elicited vis-a-vis ""Armageddon"" came from guys who don't like their action movies to move them to the verge of tears in public.

All disaster films depend on a hook to set them up. In this respect, most fall far short of realism and believability. Of ones that come immediately to mind, only the cosmic collision movies and ""The Towering Inferno"" had realistic setups.

All disaster films depend on the heros to come up with some way to save the day. Of the ones with a believable setup, many still fall short of believable and/or technically accurate resolutions. This is where ""Armageddon"" failed miserably. Mimi Leder had expert advice from NASA and it shows. ""Armageddon"" has some impressive training facilities shots from NASA, but ignored the actual technology. Very early in ""Armageddon"", when I saw the two shuttles docking with the space station by coming in from opposite directions, performing clearly aerodynamic banking maneuvers, I was ready to start pelting the screen with rotten tomatoes!

Giving the devil his due, both films glossed over the full impact of operations in the microgravity environment of the comet's surface.

Still, it's the raw emotions that elevate ""Deep Impact"" above its genre, not just the technical stuff. It's actually best in its quiet moments. Among the ones that clearly stand out:

The president (Morgan Freeman) tries to continue to maintain an upbeat message as each plan successively fails. His press conferences and the dialog around them rings true.

The dialog between the reporter (the usually annoying Tea Leoni) and her mother (Vanessa Redgrave) also rings with truth.

The ultimate reconciliation between the reporter and her father (Maximilian Schell) just before the end reflects the bitterness of choices each has made in getting to that point.

The reunion of the kid who helped discover the comet (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski), oblivious for the moment to what was going on around them - again, this simply rings true.

The astronaut observing wryly, ""Well, the good news is that we'll all have high schools named after us."" No melodramatics, no macho heroism, just someone injecting a sense of humor into a shared fate she has accepted as necessary to save the people they love. My favorite line in the film.

From start to finish, this film is a class act. A realistic film that carries an emotional impact to be expected of its serious subject matter. Part of this impact is that you can't always guess in advance which characters will and will not survive. Of the ones who don't survive, not all face their fate gracefully, but all are believable.

This movie began my fandom of Mimi Leder, who I consider to be one of the best directors working today - not always commercial, but always excellent. This is on my short list of my top ten favorite movies of all time. Highly recommended!",1096156800,257,3687,4.957860615883306

133967,4,0792153189,"I know this one often gets compared to Armageddon, and although they're similar in theme, they're really different movies. Both are flawed of course, but each one is good in it's own way. Deep Impact concentrates more on how the characters react to the dire situation (of an asteroid heading towards Earth). Armageddon concentrates more on the action and heroics of those sent to ""save the world."" Each has exceptional special effects, and a pretty good cast. I guess which one I like best depends on my mood.  I'm less upset to watch Bruce Willis' character meet his fate on the asteroid (Hey, Liv still has Ben right? She'll be fine) than I am to see Tea' Leoni and her father (played by Maximilian Schell) face a tidal wave. It's not all ""great"" acting, mind you, but each has it's moments. I like the human aspect, the effects, the actors, and the story. Inevitably, whenever I see an Earth-related disaster movie, I feel compelled to check the IMDb message board for the brainiac post(s) stating why that particular disaster could or couldn't happen. Silly I guess. But truth or not, its nice to debunk a fear with another opinion. (yep, even if it could be wrong!)",1093046400,3,1170,4.679611650485437
133968,5,0792153189,"Question: why does this movie get downgraded, bruised and discredited by Armageddon? The reason I ask is because although both movies are similar, I grant you, no way does Armageddon come CLOSE to being as good as Deep Impact. Out of the two, Deep Impact is the overwhelming better on several accounts. Firstly, there is far more realistic emotion, secondly, the special effects are so much impressive and last but certainly not least, the characters are far more believable and rememberal.

 now that I've cleared that up, I would like to say that although not my favourite film, Deep Impact still left a HUGE impact on me.

 The story follows the lives of three different people in the USA. The sofistocated and stubborn news reporter, Jenny (Tea Leoni), the powerful American President (Morgon Freeman) and the nerdy astronomy student Leo (Elijah Wood). When Leo coinsidently discovers a new ""star"" in the sky, he soon discovers that it is infact a comet the size of New York City bound for the foundations of Earth. In a race against time, the people of the world must find a way to survive the comet's formiddible onslaught and keep the slightest ray of hope that they might just survive. There is also a fourth story which focuses on a crew of astronauts stranded in Space and working against the clock to destroy as much of the astroid as possible. The different stories focus mainly on how these unique characters deal with their grief in the days leading up to dooms day.

 I loved Deep Impact because, as I mentioned earlier, it is very emotional and if you're anything like me, you will shead a couple of tears. The music is impressive and the special effects are excellent, considoring this film was made in 1998 when our forces of technonlogy hadn't reached the brillinace of today.

 My favourite story was Leo's journey. It's very sweet and the most emotional. Elijah Wood, being just 17 at the time portrayed his character to perfection. The overall acting was great as well, but Wood really did steal the show in my eyes.

 But there is a side of Deep Impact that really did haunt me right into my sleep, and this is probably a good excuse not to show this to children below the age of 11. It's the realisiation that although Deep Impact is a fictional movie, it is NOT a fictional possiblity. There is every chance that this film may very well be a prophecy. Indeed, one day, Earth will be faced with its ultimate danger.

 I can understand that some may not like this movie, but for the record I think its a powerful wake up call to us all. And, hey! If you're looking for an excuse to get a few shivers, perhaps cry a little, or see the Statue of Liberty's head bouncing around New York, this is a great film that will leave a deep impact on you for sure!",1091232000,8,2775,4.550200803212851

133972,4,0792153189,"Many people tend to compare this movie to armageddon, as they are both about the idea of a celestial body (in this case a comet, in the case of armageddon an asteroid) on a collision course with the earth, and seeing as how they were released in very close proximatey to one another. I think this has a lot to do with some people's lack of love for Deep impact, but the reality is these were two very different movies.
While ""Armageddon"" was a great movie in it's own rate, it was more of an action-romance movie that was meant to apeal to a braoder audience and satisfy movie-goers' typical demands of a major release. But with Deep Impact a much different aproach was taken, following in the way of the traditional Disaster Movie Genre.
From the beginning we are introduced to one of the main Characters, an upstart reporter investigating your run of the mill political love affair scandal, but stumbles instead upon the biggest story of history, that there is a monstrous comet on a collision course with earth. And so unfold's the American government's plan to send an team of asteronauts to intercept the comet and plant enough nukes on it to deflect it off course. The movie handles the plot from a much more epic, and at the same time much more personal level than armageddon.
The romance angle of the story is provided by the young boy who unwittingly discovered the comet and his girl neighbor. As counter measures fail, and plan B, C and D are called into action the terrible reality that only so many can be saved, and that it has to be decided who lives and dies sets in. A national lottery determines who will get passage to a special fallout shelter-like cave complex that was built in secret to house 1 million people. The rest are left to fend for themselves.
I really found deep impact to be more emotional, though not as romantic as armageddon. Characters will die, babies will be deperated from parents, young people will be asked to carry burdens that they shouldnt have to deal with and cities are destroyed as part of the asteroid hits the atlantic and causes a massive tsunami. Watching all this really had a more realistic and more message-orientated feel to it than Armageddon. I liked that the movie seemed to follow closer to the science and horrow of what a comet impact could cause, and how that affected the characters and our society. This made the movie much more interesting to me in many ways, and much realer as well.
The special effects are well done enough for the time period, and actually the tidal-wave scene where you watch a city massive wall of water inundate the city, hills and forests was quite ae inspiring. This is well done and will make your jaw drop when you see it.
The only problems are some inconsistant acting, and the fact that this movie is a bit slow and might not appeal to some viewers as much as armageddon because it's not an action movie.
All in all this was a great disaster movie and I thought it did a better job than armageddon in many ways of dealing with the actual plot scenario, though I like that movie as well just for different reasons. But if you're looking for a good sci-fi based disaster movie that will touches on many deeper levels than similar movies than this is your best bet.

Add the cast, assured direction by MIMI LEDER, and some great fx visuals, and the end result is an extreemly enjoyable thrill ride that keeps head and heart intact.

133992,5,0792153189,"Interesting that so many would call this a shallow movie.  Based on a concept of Near Earth Objects, Deep Impact has a potential deep impact on the viewer.
There are a few interesting vignettes when it comes to relationships being effected by this rather large comet headed toward impact with earth.  From the start with Beiderman, played by one of our heroes, Elijah Wood, responsible for discovering the Comet and Martin Smith (American Grafitti and the Untouchables) playing Wolf.  The Comet is named Wolf-Beiderman after these two, Wolf dies and you wonder how long it would be before the comet is really discovered.
However, Tea Leoni, playing newscaster want-to-be/reporter, discovers a cover-up that leads to an interesting intrigue with President Tom Beck, played by Morgan Freeman.
The movie develops quickly after that and the plot is very interesting.  You need to look at the relationships of Robert Duvall and his crew, Leoni, her family and friends, Wood and his loved ones.  This is a key to the success of the movie.
The concept of the Comet is really the come-on to get people to really get into the characters.  There are some interesting scenes with Earth being impacted and the final scene is very convincing.  However, the most important part of the movie was the relationships, as life seemed to come to an ebb for most of the population of earth, what will people be like?  Would there be sacrifice or selfishness.
Duvall plays a very interesting part.  As an older pilot/astronaut, he leads a group of young brash space crew who grow up quickly on their mission.
The movie is exciting and engaging.  The DVD extras add to the movie experience as well.

I saw a documentary about ""Doomsday Rocks"" (true title uncertain). It made many-a-mention of Deep Impact. How it finally gave the politicans a heads-up to finance various programmes to try to prevent rogue asteroids and/or comets from hitting Earth. Armageddon was tokenly acknowledged. This is how powerful such a movie as Deep Impact can make an impression (pun may be included).

The title of the film itself seems to indicate that the film is a deep emotional analysis of how people react when they know they are about to die, as opposed to a film about blowing up a chunk of ice hurtling towards the Earth.  Granted, there are liberties taken in the scientific accuracy department, but that doesn't detract from the story unless you are really uptight about such things.  If you go to every movie hoping they will be completely scientifically accurate, then you will be disappointed all the time.

She interviews this official, who is getting ready to depart on a long journey with his family. On her way back she is arrested by the black-suited Secret Police. The President asks he to hold off on her news. After this she discovers that E.L.E. stands for Extinction Level Event. Later the President holds a news conference to announce this threat, and the building of the ""Messiah"" that will save earth from this oncoming menace.
When the comet hits the water, it will create a tidal wave over one thousand feet high moving faster than the speed of sound. The special effects shows this hitting Manhattan, and elsewhere. The heroic crew of the Messiah survived to make a final attack on the comet. Was their sacrifice altruistic? If they didn't do it, there would be no home to return to. If they did it, they would not return home. Their sacrifice was the lesser evil. The film asks the lifeboat question: who will be saved, and how to decide? The clogged roads suggest the futility of Civil Defense evacuations. Can this be practical in today's world? At least they didn't suggest digging back yard graves as ""fallout shelters"".
The 1883 book ""Ragnarok"" by Ignatius Donnelly first suggested that a cataclysm from a passing comet was the source of the common legends of mankind. He explained the meanings behind the words. The heat from a comet vaporized the oceans, the clouds hid the sun, the coldness created glaciers from the condensing vapors. Fallout created The Drift of sand, clay, and gravel. This book will provide a new viewpoint to the old legends. Could a near miss have also affected the orbit of the earth, and caused the end of the Eocene era?
Any comet hitting the world would spread a layer of debris into the air (Krakatoa, ""nuclear winter"") that would exterminate most of the world's population.

134022,1,0792153189,"DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW if you can forgive a science fiction film for a lot of bad science. But if you are an astronomy buff like me, take this review as fair warning.
I had SUCH high hopes for this movie. ""At last!"" I thought, ""They're finally making a scientifically-accurate film about a cometary impact!"" And check out that poster! Looks like The End Of The World, for sure! COOL!
So I shelled out my money and sat down in the dark theater to watch ""Deep Impact,"" and within ten minutes I had started to squirm. ""You can't predict a comet's path that far in advance!"" I wanted to scream at the screen. Then the astronomer who discovers Earth is doomed gets KILLED in a car crash, and evidence of his discovery goes flying out the window on a diskette! I guess this was for dramatic effect.
But wait! The diskette must have been found, because now there's a secret project to move some select people deep underground, presumably to rebuild civilization after the comet hits. Except that we never get to see any of these immense underground warrens. Probably would've taken the picture over budget.
Then the smaller half of the comet hits the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in some interesting CGI. But if the larger half of the comet strikes, then civilization is most certainly doomed. What kind of a world will the underground survivors emerge to find? THAT would have made for a visionary science fiction film. But NO, we won't be treated to that, because at the very end the apocalyptic object is blown up by some heroic astronauts, and all the millions of fragments burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere. HARMLESSLY??? Hmmm, in real life the kinetic energy of the comet would still remain, and standing under the open sky would've have been like being in an oven set to BROIL. But that wouldn't have been a very crowd-pleasing ending, now would it?
Remember when the beautiful Comet Hale-Bopp lit our evening skies? Remember when Comet Shoemaker-Levy took bites out of Jupiter? If either of those objects had struck Earth, we'd be lucky to have bacteria left. This is one of the reasons we MUST begin branching out from beyond our own planet. Our survival as a species depends on this. And perhaps one day a truly visionary film director will create a movie that deals with this scenario more realistically, but ""Deep Impact"" is not that movie. For all its introspection about how humankind might deal with its impending doom, ""Deep Impact"" is bad astronomy and bad science.",1062633600,7,2476,4.707373271889401
134023,4,0792153189,"I find myself watching Deep Impact every eight months or so for some reason.  Despite a few flaws, it's really quite a good film, always moving and powerful.  This is just one of a number of apocalyptic films that came out in the late 1990s.  In this scenario, it is a rogue comet that has earth in its sights and stands a very good chance of ending life as we know it.  Elijah Wood, in his pre-Frodo Baggins days, plays Leo Biederman, a high school student who discovers an anomalous object in the heavens and hears nothing back from a local astronomer about it.  A year later, young upstart reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) is chasing a story on the resignation of the Treasury Secretary, confronting him with information about his ""mistress Ellie.""  She is perplexed when the Secretary tells her she has her hands on the story of the century, and she is even more perplexed when a bunch of G-men seize her and escort her to a meeting with the President of the United States.  Morgan Freeman plays President Tom Beck, and he is simply marvelous in this role.  Jenny and the whole world soon learn that ""Ellie"" is not a woman at all, she is an acronym.  E.L.E.=Extinction Level Event.  The President goes public with information on the approaching danger, and the world watches and waits while a group of American and Russian astronauts fly out to try and knock the comet off course.  Robert Duvall plays ""Fish"" Tanner, the aging NASA pilot who isn't welcomed with open arms by his much younger crew.  From this point on, it is high drama indeed, as the suspense builds mightily toward the day of collision.
The cast, with one exception is superb.  Duvall and Freeman deliver their normal great performances, Wood is quite believable as the youngster suddenly famous for finding the earth-seeking comet, and Leelee Sobieski is wonderful as Wood's female counterpart.  Tea Leoni failed to win me over in her role as reporter Jenny Lerner, however.  Her performance as anchor person for the main events was not something I can imagine a national network going with, especially at a time when the earth faces its biggest crisis of all time.  I could also mention one young man who crams as much annoyingly bad acting as is humanly possible into his scant few minutes in front of the camera.  I thought the special effects for this movie were fairly impressive.  The space scenes were quite good, managing to capture the deadly beauty and exotic danger of the killer comet, the explosions were satisfyingly huge, and the impact of the comet on earth is presented fairly convincingly.
There are a number of human interest stories built into the plot, and some people might tire of these subplots.  You have a woman dealing with the remarriage of her father and loneliness of her mother, a kid who can only save his childhood sweetheart by marrying her, and all sorts of doings with the masses of people trying to somehow escape on their own because the government can only save a chosen few in underground bunkers.  The intense human drama on earth, such as the emotional complexity shown by President Beck and the characters of Wood and Sobieski, is met with an even more intense human drama in space, as individuals refuse to give up even after mankind has failed to avert disaster.  The complex blending of tragedy and emotional pain teams up with intense feelings of patriotism and inspiring stories of heroism to make the conclusion something powerful that finds its way into my soul and brings a few tears to my eyes.  I think Deep Impact is an underrated movie that has a lot to offer those yet to see it.",1061251200,3,3609,4.677215189873418

134025,2,0792153189,"Maybe this is a good movie, but just not my style.  I did like Armegedon.  The plot of the movie was that the US found out that in 2 years and asteroid will strike Earth.  The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't focus on the asteroid as much as it should.  I would bet more that half of this movie had nothing to do with the asteroid.  During this time, the movie focusses on the personal lives of the characters of the movie which really isn't that interesting.  When the method of destroying the asteroid is discussed, it seems that it was thought up and planned by a 6th grade class.  Also, I didn't find the way everyone reacted mostly acurate.  So overall, if you have nothing better to do, you could rent this movie.  But if you want to see a great movie about an asteroid, see Armegedon.",1060560000,,806,4.25

The story of these four develop quite nicely, as it starts out with Leo in astronomy club, and when his teacher asks what an object is in the sky, he does not know. This of course, is the comet. It is sent to a lab, where it is found. From then the story shifts gears to Jenny, and remains with her until the president tells the world of the event. From then it is to Spurgen Tanner, and in some brief glimpses throughout the movie, President Tom Beck. The ideas and progression of the story is amazing. The directing is superb. The action is wonderfully done. It is a must see movie.",1059782400,3,972,4.4858757062146895
134027,4,0792153189,"This movie was released within a month or two of Armageddon. They both deal with the same issue, an asteroid that's bearing down on the Earth. If the asteroid impacts the Earth, all life will be destroyed.
The film follows several interlinked plotlines. One involving an aging astronaut played by Robert Duvall, and quite well I might add. He adds the spice of age and wisdom to the group of astronauts who try to avert the disaster by placing nuclear warheads on the asteroid (Comet actually) and break it apart into pieces small enough to be burned up in the atmosphere.
Another plotline involves a reporter played by Tea Leoni who stumbles across the the truth of the comet's existence and threat to the earth. She is practically estranged from her father, who recently divorced her mother for a much younger woman.
Still another plotline involves a young boy named Beiderman, who actually discovers the comet in an amateur astronomy club. The young actor eventually became Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings, so his acting skills are quite respectable.
This film tugs at the heartstrings throughout, and is a good film to have on the shelf. I've watched it a number of times, and still get a tear in the eye each time I do. If you want testosterone-induced action, watch Armageddon, but if you want a good storyline with lots of emotion, as well as some action, get this one.",1053475200,,1379,4.702479338842975

Third we have the reactions of a president and how he deals with the coming crisis safeguarding his people and suchlike
Fourth we have a mission in space to go and destroy the big bad comet before it kills us all.
While individually these plot lines are good and the ending is satisfying I thought that they all rushed together sometimes the action was too quick sometimes it was too slow.
This is one of those movies that could have been great if it could have known what it wanted and had an actual plan of attack.  As it is the film sort of stumbles about haphazardly with moments of real insight breaking in often.

134029,3,0792153189,"Having been released just 8 weeks apart in the early summer of 1998, ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"" are inexorably linked (""Deep Impact"" was released first).  Since they are both cosmic-object-threatens-Earth stories that invoved huge ad-hoc NASA missions to bore holes and drop nukes, it just makes sense.  Oh, yea, and New York gets trashed in each movie, too.  However, the films are are essentially flip-sides of each other.
This might sound sexist, but it is fairly easy to tell that this movie was directed by a female (Mimi Leder).  To quote a previous reviewer, ""This is a great SF movie by a woman director who focuses on the emotional aspects rather than the hero dynamics.""  While Jerry Bruckheimer certainly acheived the hero dynamic with his testosterone-laden ""Aramgeddon"", Mimi Leder's ""Deep Impact"" attempted to hit the emotional mark, but just about completely missed it.
Although, refreshingly, one can watch this movie without totally suspending one's concept of reality, as is required with ""Armageddon"", there is still the feeling that something isn't quite right with this film.  The elements are certainly here, such as Morgan Freeman's unremarkable, but dignified protrayal of the President.  The biggest problem is that the movie tries to set up the emotional moments in the various storylines, but then never really delivers them.
If ""Armageddon"" was an overdose of amphetamines, the ""Deep Impact"" was certainly a large quantity of Valium.  The epitome of this was Tea Leoni, whose playing of a news reporter was remarkably void of any real humanity whatsoever apart from a feeble attempt at the end.  As a matter of fact, she gave a complete sense of detachment, which I'm sure was the opposite of what was intended.
None of the other principals did anything to overcome this, except for Robert Duval, who was the veteran astronaut proving that old dogs can indeed learn new tricks, but even so, it was too little, too late.  It is just about impossible to really connect with either the story or characters.  It's akin to the soft-spoken announcer of a chamber music radio station trying to describe a riot; it just doesn't work.
""Deep Impact"" composer James Horner, who did a masterful job with the music of ""Titanic"", unfortunately misses the mark, too.  ""Titanic"" fans will find a lot of familiarity in the film score, as some of the themes bear a striking resemblance to James Cameron's epic.  The music here though, instead of reinforcing the emotions (as it did in ""Titanic"") seems to further add to the sense of detachment.  This is suprising, being a James Horner score, but it didn't fit in very well.
Despite it's faults, and they're big ones, there is still a lot to like about ""Deep Impact"".
In last half-hour of the film, things actually start getting a little interesting hour of calamity arrives.  There is action without overblown antics.  The special effects are all tastefully done and reasonably realistic, which is refreshing to the heavy-handed ones in ""Armageddon"".  The comet of ""Deep Impact"" looks like it should, just merrily Hale-Bopping along and minding it's own business (until Earth just wanders into its path).  This is opposed to the ""Armageddon"" astroid's actively stalking, menacing appearance.  I am admittedly no expert on tsunamis, but the one in this film seems to be the most realistic one I've seen.  The explosions are kept to a minimum, and makes it all the more believeable.
Although nowhere near the magnitude of the whoppers in ""Armageddon"" there are a few technical errors worth noting:
- The comet certainly looks a *lot* bigger than it's advertised size (7 miles) in the landing and drilling scenes.
- Exactly how was the comet's initial path calculated based on a single picture?
- Those familiar with the lay of the land in New York City probably realize that the only way the wave could hit where it did was for it to have originated in NEW JERSEY and not the actual ocean.
- The part of the comet that impacted in the Atlantic did so while moving east at a high velocity.  How could that produce such a powerful westbound wave?",1043884800,2,4107,4.923188405797101
134030,5,0792153189,"A few years ago, two movies were made that dealt with asteroids hitting the earth.  One was ""Armageddon"", the other was this fine film, ""Deep Impact"".  This movie stars Tea Leoni as Jenny Lerner, a reporter for CNBC who discovers news about an ""E.L.E"", Extinction Level Event.  Apparently, a comet ""the size of Mt. Everest"", according to the film, is on a collision course with earth.  Under orders from the President, played superbly by veteran actor Morgan Freeman, construction on a space vehicle has started.  Built by the United States and Russia, the ""Messiah"" will deliver eight nuclear warheads, place them inside the rogue comet, and blow it off course.  The Messiah is commanded by astronaut Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall).
The comet has a rotation period of fourteen hours, and the crew of Messiah can only work during darkness due to the escaping compressed vapors and extremely high temperatures when the comet is in daylight.
After detonation of the warheads, the comet splits into two pieces, and both are still on a collision course with earth.  Meanwhile, people are hoarded to Missouri's limestone hills to live underground until its safe to start over.  The people have been randomly selected by a computer.
A plan is devised to fire missiles at the comet to see if they can alter its course, but this ultimately fails as well.  Finally, the crew of Messiah decides to crash their ship and four remaining nukes into the large section of the comet, as its too late to stop the smaller piece from hitting the earth.
The special effects in this movie are awesome, especially the entry of the smaller comet into the atmosphere and the ensuing tidal wave that envelops New York City.  Maximillian Schell, Vanessa Redgrave, and Elijah Wood do excellent jobs in their roles as well.
I feel this movie had a more ""human"" side to it than ""Armageddon"".  I enjoyed both movies, but Armageddon seemed to be a little more ""on the edge"" than Deep Impact.  In this movie, you could really relate to the characters and the urgency and utter hopelessness of their situation.  I didn't get that feeling with Armageddon.
Both of these movies are good in their own right.  I recommend both, but Deep Impact focuses on the plight of the characters more.  I think action movie fans would enjoy them, but perhaps for different reasons.",1043280000,8,2332,4.838790931989925

(3) President Morgan Freeman affirms his belief in God and blesses the nation with a prayer.

Instead it reaches down into the human heart and draws us into characters and events that are at times thrilling, at times heart breaking. The scenes of destruction are terrifying, made more so by the depth of the characters that get swept up in the cataclysm.

The cast includes the ever-great Morgan Freeman, superb Robert Duvall, newcomer Tea Leoni, and screen favorite Vanessa Redgrave. A lot of movies try too crowd too many good actors into a story line, with awful results. Somehow this one works. All the characters are believable. And you care about them. Morgan Freeman is painful to watch at times, he performs so well.
People die in this movie. But you feel though through their sacrifice, hope will prevail. It different from Armaggedon.

134062,4,0792153189,"In 1998, as has often happened in years past, two movie studios competed directly by producing films with identical themes. This year the subject was huge asteroids on a collision course with Earth. Paramount was feverishly working on ""Deep Impact,"" while Disney was toiling away on ""Armageddon.""
Luckily, Paramount had two things in its favor with ""Deep Impact"". It had a film that cost half as much as Disney's giant, and it got the movie into theaters several weeks sooner. As a result, it also proved to be major succes.
In some ways, ""Deep Impact"" proved once again that smaller can be better. While its director, Mimi Leder, has been working for eleven years, the first nine of these were strictly in television. She has won two Emmys for her efforts on ""ER"". Since the picture did not have the astronomical budget of its competitor, her training at character portrayal and at manipulation of our emotions makes it the better of the two.
Although the FX are unspectacular by current standards, Paramount and Leder remembered that audience identification with characters can have enormous pull. So many people, for example, are still mesmerized by the first ""Star Wars"" trilogy, but in thinking about them, we always remember Luke Skywalker, Hans Solo and the Princess, as well as the visuals. For that matter, had it not been for the story of Jack and Rose, it's probable that ""Titanic"" would have sank almost as fast as the ship itself.
As an ""ER"" veteran, Leder certainly knows which heart strings to pull. It certainly helped that she had a battery of veteran performers in the cast. Robert Duvall is especially compelling as an aging astronaut, who is sent into space with a bunch of youngsters to attempt to blow the asteroid into harmless fragments. Morgan Freeman walks through his role as President of the United States, but he walks nicely. Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell shine as the divorced parents of Jenny, a TV reporter, who is quite well portrayed by Tea Leoni. Elijah Wood shows his usual intensity in his role as a stereotypical teenage genius. Since the seventeen year old Wood is now working on his 18th film, I imagine he qualifies as a veteran.
Through its emphasis on emotional issues, ""Deep Impact"" overcomes a plot which is both full of holes and seriously flawed scientifically. In defense of the screen writers, I'll add that any attempt to make a two hour movie which depicts the possible annihilation of life as we know it is doomed to come off as trite. The only possible s exceptions I can think of are ""On the Beach"", made way back in 1959, and ""The Day After"", made, ironically, for TV.
There are two aspects of ""Deep Impact"" that perplexed me. James Horner's musical score is his most uninspired in ages. The main reason I bring this up is that the music is the one component that can equal the film's theme. Since the soundtrack is one of the last things done in making a movie, I imagine he might have already been dazed and confused by his ""Titanic"" success when he tackled this project's even grimmer subject.
The other complaint is over the final scene in the picture. I have a gut feeling the director would agree with me because it is counter to the mood she strove to achieve in the rest of it. This could have happened simply because she has not worked on the big screen long enough to have any control over the final cut.",1017273600,2,3379,4.69023569023569

However, Near Dark did not get the promotions that the Lost Boys did. and Near Dark just like Deep Impact was a 1000% better and more believable.

134066,4,0792153189,"Here is a good and moving film, based on a significant amount of legitimate science, about the implications of an Earth impact of a large meteor or asteroid. Its best performances include those of Morgan Freeman as US President and Robert Duvall as leader of a crew of astronauts trying to destroy the giant meteor. The rest of his crew includes some impressive members as well. Minor detractions include something of an overdosing on the strong-headedness of a news reporter played by Tea Leoni. That overdosing gets grating at times, though her performance is not without its bright and moving moments as well. Her mother is palyed by Vanessa Redgrave, who seems to be a jinxed actress in recent years. For all her imressive array of worthy past performances, she's hasn't seemed able to land a worthy role for some time. It would have been nice if this movie could have broken that jinx for her, but it doesn't. Her character's ex-husband and father of the reporter is played by Maxmillian Schell, about the most bland of major characters, neither highly memorable nor particularly distracting. But the younger members of the cast are perhaps the biggest surprise. Elijah wood plays a young amateur astronomer who discovered the menacing meteor. He's as major a character as any others, and proves altogether up to task of playing a crucial role. His girlfriend is played by Leelee Sobieski (oh, that all her performances could be this grand).

134067,1,0792153189,"With just three films under her belt, Mimi Leder has established herself as a legitimate contender for the title of the Worst Mainstream Director working today.  What distinguishes Leder from other mediocre directors is that she seems to take her films so incredibly seriously.  Exhibit one: Deep Impact.
In a familiar plot, it is discovered that, in just a few short weeks, a gigantic meteor is going to wipe out all life on Earth.  The film becomes about how the people of Earth prepare to meet their fate and in Leder's utopian vision, that fate is met with dignity.  Never has dignity been quite as sickening and downright dull as in this film.  In attempt to qualify as an ""epic,"" the film follows four interconnected plotlines that are meant to illuminate the full reach of the human experience.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't have enough imagination for one plotline and, in the end you get four subplots involving generic, uninteresting characters doing just what you'd expect them to.
In the first plotline, we meet a crew of brave astronaughts who are sent to make a last ditch effort to save our planet.  The crusty old timer is played by Robert Duvall. This plotline is actually halfway compelling.  Natrually, Leder devotes the least amount of time to it.
In our second plotline, Elijah Wood plays a high school science nerd who discovers the meteor that's going to kill everyone on the planet.  Natrually, this makes him the most popular kid in school.  He gets to speak at a school assembly where all of his soon-to-be-horribly-killed classmates applaud him and assure him that he's now going to have more sex than he knows what to do with.  Hmmm...maybe this is the way Leder and the film's writers would like to think a bunch of high school kids would react to their impending doom.  I have doubts that the nerdy kid who just told everyone they're going to die would then be reborn as some sort of apocalyptic sex symbol.  But maybe I just need to go hang out in Hollywood a little bit more.
In the most mundane plotline, Tea Leoni is cast as a newswoman who basically uncovers Wood's discovery and, despite the best efforts of the government, broadcasts this news to the world.  To the abject horror of any viewer who hasn't been meditating for the past few years, Leoni's scenes are used to make big statements about life.  Leoni is a wonderful comedic actress so natrually, she plays a totally humorless character here and looks bored to be doing it.  Her rich, vaguely European parents are divorced and are played by Vanessa Redgrave and Maximellian Schell.  Redgrave is a bit of a pain as she tells us that the knowledge of her impending death is probably the best thing that could have happened.  Its freed her up to concentrate on living, she tells Leoni.  It would be interesting to see how somebody who was neither rich nor old would react to that.  I doubt that a guy in his early twenties who is working retail to pay for college would be as content to hear that he's now going to die before he can accomplish anything.  But, we don't get to hear from any of those folks, perhaps because Leder hasn't ever met any in Hollywood.  If this seems to be a petty complaint, its one that Leder opens herself up to by presenting Redgrave's silly comments as an important statement.
Lastly, Morgan Freeman is the President.  Freeman's one of the few actors out there who can convey the type of moral weight that the role calls for.  But wouldn't the film have been much more interesting if, instead of some all-seeing, wise leader -- we'd instead had, say, Peter Sellers' President Merkin Muffley from Dr. Strangelove?  It doesn't help that Freeman's plan to save humanity (all the important people hide out in underground caves for a few years while all the unimportant people die) is the exact same plan proposed in Dr. Strangelove.
Of course, what's truly annoying is that once this plan is announced, its accepted by everyone with, of course, dignity.  Sure, we get a few shots of an angry crowd trying to get into the caves but those crowds are made up of extras.  The characters we've gotten to see all except their fate with a stoic acceptance that wouldn't be so offensive if not for that fact that Leder seems to be so convinced that this foolish display is somehow making an invaluable statement about the human condition.  Couldn't we see just one character say, ""Wait a minute -- I'm going to die and that little pipsqueak Wood gets to live just because he discovered the stupid meteor!?""  But no, that just wouldn't fit into the film's artistic aspirations.  Watching all of this, one is reminded that Ed Wood sincerely did mean for Plan 9 to be a touching anti-war statement.  Leder's film -- with its thinly drawn characters and niavely smug attempts to be important -- may have made her feel like a better human being but that doesn't make it any less of a pain to sit through.",1005177600,5,4914,4.646242774566474

134069,5,0792153189,"ARMAGEDDON may have gotten most of the glory at the box office, but for me DEEP IMPACT was the better ""space-rock"" disaster film of 1998.  It had more humanity, a sense of awe and fear, a far more realistic plot, and better acting.
The space rock in this case is a seven mile-wide comet on a collision course with our planet.  A joint US/Russian team, led by Robert Duvall, is given the unenviable task of drilling nuclear bombs into the comet to either destroy it or send it off course.  Their attempt is only partly successful, and creates a new problem--two different pieces on the same course, one a mile and a half, the other five miles.  Either one would strike with enough power to create an Extinction Level Event.
Director Mimi Leder, who made her feature film debut with THE PEACEMAKER in 1997 and directed numerous episodes for the TV series ""E.R."", keeps the focus on human issues, which makes the final destruction scenes truly awesome.  Morgan Freeman makes for one of the better film presidents of recent times, and James Horner's score is extremely well done.  Duvall, of course, is as fine in his role as any he has ever done; he is one of those actors that can often be relied upon in virtually anything.
One of the best pure science fiction movies of the last ten years, DEEP IMPACT is more than a standard-issue disaster flick, and it is leaps and bounds ahead of ARMAGEDDON as a movie in general.",1002844800,,1417,4.559055118110236
134070,3,0792153189,"Of the two asteroid disaster movies that were released, it is really hard to tell who is the winner.

Armageadon had nonstop Yeah-right action, but also had a somewhat good charachters and story. Deep Impact, however, tries to convey a sense of doom and destruction rather then blown out action. It only succeds in the latter part.

The movie starts out interestingly enough. A ameatur astronamer sees a really big rock heading for earth and the planet plunges into peril. For the rest of the movie, we witness society collpse, panic and more panic. Twords the end of the film, you really don't care what happens to the poor innocent people that will surley die. For me, the best part of the movie occours near the very end of the film. That is when the smaller asteroid hits earth and causes a huge tidal wave that wipes out 50% of the planet. The 4 minute tidal wave sequence is worth waiting through over an hour of boring story to witness. Its increadible to witness new york get engulfed in the tidal wave and several other cities.

Overall, Deep Impact succeds at the short action sequences and not really in the people section.

The Good: The spectacular tidal wave sequence, all the panic is interesting to watch, mildly good ""Were all going to die"" Additude

The bad: Little action

And the ugly: gets boring after 15 minutes",1000771200,,1334,4.63135593220339
134071,5,0792153189,"I have to say that I enjoyed DEEP IMPACT a whole lot more than ARMAGEDDON, even though I loved that one, too. DEEP IMPACT, I think, is less-known because it was released like, right after ARMAGEDDON and that one was more hyped-over than DEEP IMPACT. But I think DEEP IMPACT had a better, more solid plot and more of a believable storyline with believable, talented actors. I don't say that there's anything wrong with Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, or Billy Bob Thortan (they are all great actors) but Robert DuVall, Tea Leoni, Morgan Freeman, Eljiah Wood, and Leelee Sobiski were better choices for this kind of film in some way.
Anyway, DEEP IMPACT is about a teen astronomer, Leo (Elijah Wood) from an astronomy club at school, who discovers that a comet, large and powerful enough to destroy the world, is heading straight for earth. There is no stopping it. And now the government must try to find a way to save the people before everything is destroyed. One thing I liked about this film that I thought was more cleaver and intelligent than in ARMAGEDDON was the fact that in DEEP IMPACT, the comet actually hit the earth and everything was destroyed. In ARMAGEDDON, they save the world in the last few seconds. And I just thought the ending twist of DEEP IMPACT was more believable and cleaver.
But anyway, both films are actually really good. The special effects (sound effects and visual effects) are absolutely stunning in DEEP IMPACT. This is a very original and underrated masterpiece. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes good sci-fic and action films!",999561600,3,1583,4.781021897810219
134084,4,0792153189,"Deep Impact is a subdued film regarding what mght happen during a comet impact of the Earth. As such, its not a perfect movie by any means. There are several issues that are gotten wrong despite the fact that the Shoemakers (of Comet Shoemaker-Levy fame) consulted on the movie.
That being said, a movie like this is always a tightrope between accuracy and entertainment and I think Deep Impact hit the right balance between the two, ultimately. The movie is accurate enough with its science, although there are some holes, yes.  It is also sincere enough with its drama without going realistically overboard. Face it, done really realistically, this movie's content would depress you to suicide. Here I think the right decision was made to tone down the portrayal of panic that would accompany an announcement like this.
And in the end, I think the film's best attributes - ironically - are in public awareness and education. Such a collison of another body with Earth will happen, its just a matter of time. We are the only species on the planet that MIGHT be able to do something about it, but only if we start searching and keep searching now.
Why do I say ""ironically"" this film is good for public awareness and education? ""Deep Impact"" portrays a comet's collison with Earth. Even if we search really well a comet will, in all probabilty, be discovered too late to really do anything about. But we can also be hit by asteroids and those we can search for, plot, predict (to some degree) and push out of the way.

134086,4,0792153189,"I have been wanting to watch this movie for so long and now that I have seen it, here are few things that came to mind.
First, knowing that this movie and ""Armageddon"" were both going to be compared because they came out the same year and nearly the same time about the same topic, ""Armageddon"" is more action based and focusing about people trying to save the Earth.  ""Deep Impact"" is somewhat the same but focuses more about people and their last days on Earth and impending doom.  It focused on people and their emotions more than action.
I really enjoyed the movie and there are a lot of popular people in this film which is a plus.  The acting was good but Tea Leoni...I like her a lot but her acting in this movie was not at all involving and emotional.  I really couldn't care less for her character because of the acting.
I'm glad this movie is different from ""Armageddon"" because it would lose if it was an action film.  You need action stars like Bruce Willis but in ""Deep Impact"" our heroes in Robert Duvall, Blair Underwood and others were still good to watch and again, this movie is about saving the world but knowing that doom is ahead.
The video was very colorful and beautiful.  The sound was awesome but I believe I got more out of my 5.1 in ""Armageddon"" but that doesn't mean ""Deep Impact"" is a slouch because it sounds good!
As for special features, just only a teaser trailer and the theatrical trailer.  I'm sure they could of added more to this DVD and that was the only thing I was bummed out about.

The main plot of the story is that a comet,known as the Wolf-Beiterman, is discovered to be on a track for contact with Earth. After the US Administration keeps it a secret for a year, it is revealed that safety measures must be taken. A spacecraft Messiah is sent up to stop the comet.
This movie goes a lot deeper then the astronomical/catastrophical  cover. It is a story of self-sacrifice, family, and true love. Almost every character sacrificed someone to this, whether it be a child, a parent, or themselves. Families were broken up when parents gave up their children so that they could be safe. True love was a large part of this movie, between families and between couples.

Now the world must find a way to stop the comet and destroy it before the comet destroys them! I know, I know...like I've said before: your typical ""earth killer"" film.

When files get messed up, and they can't take Sarah's family with them, Sarah must decide whether to go with her husband or stay with her family.

134092,4,0792153189,"Since ""D E E P IMPACT"" and ""Armageddon"" were released at approximately the same time in theaters, moviegoers will most likely always compare the two.  It's apples and oranges though. The title ""D E E P IMPACT"" is really a play on words that goes over most people's heads I guess.  Anyone expecting an MTV-like retread of ""Armageddon"" will definitely be disappointed.  This is a serious movie that treats it's audience with respect and is NOT just an excuse to make a 2 1/2-hour ""Aerosmith"" video like the other movie was.  Also, this movie is the more realistic of the two as well.  When these movies were released, NASA actually chimed in their two cents and commented on how completely accurate the scenario was. They commented on the national lottery system for choosing the survivors that was executed in the film as well as the use of the cavern in the mountains where they would remain until Earth was habitable again, etc.  This movie has all the effects too, but it also affects you as well. The reality is that this type of holocaust happened already with the dinosaurs and is very likely to happen again (fortunately probably not in our lifetime though). But...what if? What would you do if you knew the end was coming and who would you spend that time with?  Would you seek out friends or loved ones that you've been estranged from and make amends?  Would you try to survive somehow?
Being a New Yorker I saw this movie in a theater with many other New Yorkers, and I will always remember the scene where a gargantuan tidal wave hits New York City.  Now the audience sitting in the theater has an aerial view of this scene, watching groups of frantic people on the rooftops of several skyscrapers running from one side of the rooftops to another, trying to avoid the wave.  Then there is a cut to the streets of New York which is now under several hundred feet of water, where we see taxi-cabs and the Statue of Liberty's mangled head floating aimlessly into buildings and each other. At this moment there was ABSOLUTE SILENCE in the Movie Theater.  You could've heard a pin drop.

134109,4,0792153189,"Movies made in the hopes of earnings lots of money from box office sales usually don't fare well, but that is not the case with Paramount's ""Deep Impact,"" the first of two asteroid thrillers to come out on 1998. Unlike Touchstone's ""Armageddon,"" this movie's plot is much more lucid, relying not on predictability, but on slow-building intensity, interesting twists and turns, and characters that we can care for from beginning to end. This film has a human element to back its story, which makes it much more emotional and entertaining for the audience. If you've seen the theatrical trailer, then the movie will be ruined somewhat, but if not, or even if you enjoy movies with trailer spoilers, then this movie will be entertaining and intense.
The movie begins with high school students looking at the sky, one of them spotting a mass in the sky that seems out of place. He sends his images and graphs to an astronomer, who concludes that is is an Earth-bound asteroid which will cause worldwide destruction and death. In his haste to rush his findings to a different lab, he is involved in a fatal accident that destroys his information. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., the vice president has just resigned, and while the media thinks its because of an extramarital affair, news reporter Jenny Lerner discovers that it is something else.
This forces the President to make public the fact that there is an asteroid headed towards Earth, and that they have taken necessary action on hopes of preserving human life. Meanwhile, a team of astronauts is sent up to the asteroid to try and destroy it, but their mission is a failure, which calls for more counter-actions. The big climax comes to intense life as those who have been selected for safety are grouped together, leaving the others to fend for themselves as they wait to see whether or not the asteroid will strike.
The movie follows some typical cliches and plotlines that you normally find in movies of the nature. The asteroid's perseverance is one of these; no matter what they do to try and destroy it or knock it off its trajectory, it still keeps coming back, each time faster and more dangerous. This is really the only thing you'd find in another movie, though. The plot keeps a high level of originality as we watch the lives of the people affected by the impending disaster.
This is told in three separate stories: Leo Biederman, who first spotted the comet, reporter Jenny and how her personal life comes to a crossroads with the announcement of the comet's course, and the astronauts in space, who have the toughest job of all in saving the planet. Biederman's story centers around his family and that of his girlfriend's, and the choices both of them must make in order to survive impending doom. Jenny's parents are divorced, and she must come to terms with the anger she holds for her father as the countdown gets closer to completing. The astronauts, of course, must deal with intense situations and a perilous mission to save the planet, which provides for a lot of the action in the movie.
The fact that it takes its time in diving into these character's lives gives it a much richer, emotional feel. In this movie, we can actually care about what happens to the planet because we see life in many different ways, through different peoples' eyes. We also get a chance to think about what we would do in their situation, placing ourselves in their shoes when it comes down to who's going into the caves and who's not. And instead of going down trodden paths, the characters do things that surprise us, keeping the story original and the suspense moving.
The science behind the making of this movie is, for the most part, authentic and believable. The asteroid-hitting-Earth theory is exercised quite well, surrounding itself with historical scientific findings which are used to lead up to the story for this movie. The space aspect of the movie may seem a bit hokey, but give it some credit: it does provide us with a feel for what we might do if we were given this type of situation. The hokiness is downplayed by the sincere acting and special effects, which are not totally seamless but believable enough. There is also an interesting take on how an asteroid might change things if it were to hit Earth, but I'll leave all the details out of that so as to keep it a surprise.
The actors here are all-star, and this is one of those movies where each performance is strong and credible. Morgan Freeman plays the President of the United States, and brings with him all his austerity and onscreen presence that he possesses in his other roles. Tea Leoni is Jenny Lerner, and she is able to bring to life Jenny's perseverance and ambition, while keeping the role emotionally involved as well. Elijah Wood is Leo Biederman, and he moves with a swiftness all his own, breathing life into his character. He is the ideal science geek who is boyishly handsome, which is important for a role like this. Other actors include Robert Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave, and others, all of whom add here and there to the heart and emotional core of the story.
""Deep Impact"" is more or less mainstream summer entertainment for the masses, and given this, it does quite well for itself, taking its time in bringing to life its thrilling story. The characters are given time to develop, and the story never fails in delivering intensity and suspense. I must confess I am a nut for movies of this genre, and while this one of is not the best of the best, it certainly deserves recognition and praise.",985219200,4,5551,4.706063720452209

Criticisms and logic-flaws of Deep Impact.
1. From the very first scene we know that the writer has already lost the plot; how this got past the producer, I'll never know; the boy-next-door type kid hero peers through his ten cent telescope and sees - a comet! Wow! I wonder why none of the thousands of other amateur astronomers with powerful instruments missed it, not to mention the hundreds of observatories. Oh well I guess they just weren't looking in the right spot. So now we are supposed to believe that the ONE LONE astronomer who calculated the comet's trajectory is the ONLY ONE who worked out that it was on a collision course - duh!
2. Here we are one year later (if they are close enough to be seen by a backyard telescope, most comets take only a few weeks to pass by the earth and circle the sun, however this one takes a year ...) and apparently NO-ONE ELSE has twigged that there is a 2 kilometre chunk of ice heading for us ... so the President decides to keep it a secret. But then after he does announce it to the world, not much happens. In reality, people would immediately start panic-buying. Within a few days ALL the shops would be out of stock. People would stop going to work to protect their families as the survivalist ""it's us or them"" mentality sets in. Society collapses very quickly under these conditions, the utilities collapse, marshal law is established for a while until the military chain of command also caves in. Religious revival, rioting, looting, anarchy on a global scale ... money would mean nothing, the stock markets crash within days ... but in the movie this did not happen until just before the comet hit ... strange ...
3. The Russians (bless their little hearts) come to the rescue by SECRETLY (oh yeah? How do you hide a spaceship the size of a battleship in orbit?) constructing a shiny big new spaceship with a TOTALLY NEW AND UNTESTED NUCLEAR FUSION DRIVE IN ONE YEAR! A kind of turbo spaceship, probably made out of bits of the scrapped Mir. If the Russians can't even build a measly new trailer-home-sized module for the new international spacestation in several years, let alone a completely new propulsion system (where the hell did they test this thing?) ... well you be the judge. I'd rather believe that it was powered by Yeltsin's vodka stock.
4. The gung-ho Yank crew with token Cool Russian behind the wheel (piloting the ship like he was driving his Lada through Moscow traffic) race off to blow up the comet (didn't anyone bother to tell them that even if they did blow it up, all the pieces are still gonna be travelling at the same speed and in the same direction? Look guys, listen up, I'll say this just once, what you gotta do is ALTER ITS DAMN COURSE - NOT BLOW IT INTO A MILLION LITTLE PIECES, ALL TRAVELLING AT THE SPEED OF A BULLET, THAT WILL COME RAINING DOWN ON OUR CITIES LIKE A COSMIC SHOTGUN BLAST!) but instead  of flying PARALLEL to the swirling ball of ice, the stupid twits fly RIGHT UP ITS TAIL! Well I suppose if Yuri or whatever the driver's name was, is used to dodging all those potholes in Moscow, then a few meteors spewing out from the comet's tail is a piece of piss! Pity that this damaged the ship though.
5. So after they finally detonate the cool nuclear explosives and split the comet into 2 big bits instead of millions of small ones, they retreat and lick their wounds wondering what to do now that they have failed. They argue about not having enough fuel to return to the comet and have another go. Excuse me? Did I miss something? Aren't they travelling at the same speed and direction as the comet? Only further away to avoid the shockwave of the blast - even though in space there is nothing to propagate a
shockwave ... it would only take a minor course correction to return them to the comet. Ah but we need all that unnecessary drama don't we? Or do we?
6. So finally the small bit impacts in the Atlantic with the predictable VERY BIG SPLASH. It would've been nice to see this from the crew's perspective - the panic in their eyes as a  second later as they ploughed into the pillar of lava that would be spewing up from the miles-wide fissure that has opened up in the continental shelf (which the computer animators completely forgot about) - right behind the REALLY BIG BIT as it dug itself into the crater left by the first bit. Research please! Who consulted the astronomers? Fire them!
7. And what was all that tosh the Prez was spouting about survivors being able to come out of their nice warm cavern to the surface in TWO years? Try 10,000 years mate. There's a very good reason the dinosaurs are only in the museums and computers. The dust cloud would cover the earth for at least that long, the temperatures at the equator would be minus 20 within a month, and you can forget about finding any food. All plants and animals (and people, except those living near volcanic hot springs) would have died from the volcanoes and earthquakes and choking fumes and volcanic dust and ... oh you get the picture ... that would shake the planet for hundreds of years after ... But that wouldn't have been much fun would it? It would have been more believable to have Superman leap out of his wheelchair and push the comet into the sun. But he's just never around when you need him is he?

To try and stop it, they send a group of astronauts to try and destroy the meteor, lead by Tanner (Duvall).  The major strength of this movie is the human reaction.  Each character reacts differently to the disaster to become them.  Some worry about themselves and flee without a second thought and some worry about other people, which is what is believeable.  Deep Impact takes the middle ground, in other words instead of letting the meteor hit, they are able to spilt into two pieces, with the larger piece being destroyed in a scene that may just bring tears to your eyes.
Compared to Armegeddon, this movie is a masterpiece.  This one has more realism and it is not made like a 120 minute trailer as Roger Ebert once pointed out about Armegeddon.

134116,2,0792153189,"It is inevitable that these two movies be compared, and certainly the acting of Duvall, Freeman etc is superior in Deep Impact compared to Willis, et al, in Armageddon, but I feel Criterion has chosen the correct film to give it's special treatment to.  The subplots are trivial in both, but they are just more entertaining in Armageddon.  The ""puppy love"" story in DI could scarcely keep the interest of of anyone over age 20. The take on the ""modern"" astronauts having contempt for the space pioneer character of Duvall rings as false as anything in film.  Current space explorers would react towards Shepherd/Armstrong/Glenn and company the way a young opera company would if Placido Domingo were suddenly assigned to their ""team"".  Both films have essentially the same plot: go out to space and ""nuke"" a meteor before it annihilates humanity.... plan goes awry and self-less sacrifice at the last second saves the day.  I just had more fun watching Armageddon, and movies should either entertain you or make you think.

You'll be eager to see the astronauts on their heroic mission, instead you'll be tormented by Elijah staring at LeeLee.  This movie also disguisted me, for instance, the point of attack (when the actual movie's meat started) comes during a hyper-close up of a fat guy's cheek blubber shaking as he sloppily eats pizza. The camera is pretty much sitting on the guy's top lip for about six minutes before the guy looks at at screen and realizes an asteroid is about to hit.

134132,2,0792153189,"The premise is great: a disaster flick centering around the human response to impending annihilation.
Too bad it was so darned uninteresting.
The  movie never really found its focus. There were glimpses of the national  reaction, mainly viewed through the plans of the U.S. government (once  again, the United States are the saviors of the planet! Does this seem a  little egocentric?) The fact that this preparation took a backseat in the  film was a real mistake. For me, the most compelling notion in the movie  was how do we choose who survives? Here, survivors were selected from a  random pool of anyone under age 50.
I just couldn't forgive the  inaccuracy of this lottery. Think of all the factors that would be  introduced in trying to procure a sample of people who would be best for  survival. First of all, what about genetic makeup? Wouldn't people be  screened for predisposition to disease, mental health problems, or more  importantly, sterility? Barren men and women would be out, they would be  unable to build the population base back up. Furthermore, there is no way  our country has evolved to the point were race and socioeconomic stature  would not figure into this selection. Think of the frightening  ""genetic cleansing"" that could occur if some facist were in  charge of this task. Eek!
I understand that this was not the point of the  movie...but why not? Instead we follow the astronauts in space, which  followed a typical ""wisdom and experience takes the young by the  hand"" moralistic clause, and the lives of a few families back on  earth. Way too much of the wooden Tea Leoni was the end result. The  representation of the avearge American once again focused on white, middle  class families. Furthermore, the final solution of as long you're okay with  your family, whether you live or die is irrelevant is a rather shallow  theme.
The ending provided some interesting thought which of course was  underscored; since the Comet hit the Atlantic, only the East Coast and  Europe were affected. Essentially, Japan and East Asia were unharmed. While  the U.S. rebuilds its capitol, perhaps it will no longer enjoy the status  of world leader? Ah well, perhaps a topic for the sequel.",967420800,3,2213,4.873655913978495
134133,5,0792153189,"I absolutely loved this movie, and in my opinion, one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Now, a lot of people are saying that this is the worst  movie they've ever seen, because it's not FX-ridden, Tea Leoni can't act,  too depressing, and so on.  I actually agree with that.  For a  ""blockbuster,"" the FX were very limited, Tea Leoni was monotonous  throughout the whole movie (I don't know how someone can say  ""daddy"" so unpassionately when it's SUPPOSED to be), and it did  make me cry a lot (this coming from a teenage guy...).  So, why did I love  it?  It affected me where my heart is.  It was a movie in which I could  emphatize with all the characters.  It wasn't like this was a joking  matter.  Obviously, if the world's gonna end, you wouldn't be trying to  crack jokes.  It touched me, and made me realise the importance of having  relationships, and keeping them. Also, Leelee Sobieski acted quite well.  I  think she could have done a better job of acting the main role than Tea.  The way she was heartbroken to leave her parents, the love she had for  them, was amazing. I think I've watched it at least 7 times, and each time,  I never fail to cry....  Yes, it might be depressing, but you know, hope  survives.  Life goes on.  You gotta make the best of what you have. And  that is all I have to say.",966297600,2,1319,4.286885245901639

To tell the  truth this is the most moving disastor movie I've ever seen. It seems every  charachter gives a powerhouse performance. This was a relief after watching  the charachters in Armageddon make jokes just when Earth was supposed to be  destroyed. The cast includes the ever-great Morgan Freeman, superb Robert  Duvall, newcomer Tea Leoni, and screen favorite Vanessa Redgrave. A lot of  movies try too crowd too many good actors into a story line, with awful  results. Somehow this one works. All the characters are believable. And you  care about them. Morgan Freeman is painful to watch at times, he performs  so well.
People die in this movie. But you feel though through their  sacrifice, hope will prevail. It different from Armaggedon. I felt that  they killed charachters off in that movie to either keep the plot going, or  because they had already served their purpose.

The premise of this film was that the earth would be destroyed by collision with another celestial object, and that only a  select few (and how they are selected forms the core of the film) could be  saved.  Is this starting to sound vaguely familiar?
About the only  improvement I can see in the last half century is that the wonderfully  gifted Morgan Freeman is cast as U.S. President -- an idea that would have  been unthinkable in 1951.  The only reason I mention this is because most  viewers of the movie I talk to never noticed Mr. Freeman's race -- only his  absolute credibility as the President of a nation in crisis.  So, to  contradict my subject line, I guess things DO change, after all.
In any  case, the question of how we as a species would deal with our own  individidual and collective exinction is a profound one that deserves more  thoughtful treatment than it received in either of these films.",963532800,,992,4.620689655172414
134145,3,0792153189,"...but then, we knew that before we opened the DVD case, didn't we?  Whereas Armageddon promises manly Bruce Willis and dreamy Ben Affleck in all of their sweaty, world-saving glory, Deep Impact has a different focus:  ""Hope Survives.""
True, both stories (which released the same  year, probably to the chagrin of both) deal with a massive object hurtling  toward the earth and mankind's efforts to prevent a repeat of the  dinosaur-extincting smack of so long ago.  But ""Deep Impact,"" as  a title, may refer less to the single, devastating splash so heavily  featured in this film's promotions, than it refers to the impact one human  being can have on the life of another.  Between parents and children,  between mentors and wards, between governing and governed, between friends,  between lovers, and even between strangers, Deep Impact features some of  the most moving acts of selflessness in modern filmmaking.
For all its  emotional appeal, though, Deep Impact leaves me a little cold with certain  technical elements.  When we join the crew of the ""Messiah,"" the  souped-up space shuttle which challenges the incoming comet, I feel as  though we've entered a giant video game, where pretty colored CRT screens  count down the number of seconds remaining in the game, while tallying our  remaining strength and ammunition.  In fact, just about all of the  ""in-space"" scenes pale in comparison even to Armageddon (which  itself contained the most un-realistic space shuttle ""chase  scenes"" I've seen outside of the Star Wars genre).
I enjoyed  watching Deep Impact, and it does provide a moving story if you can get  past its almost-successful special effects.  I won't recommend this one for  purchase, however--the DVD contains none of the ""making-of""  materials I like to see, and does not even offer subtitles.  Rent this one,  or if you're sure you want to own it, save yourself a few bucks and  purchase the VHS.",961977600,3,1924,5.047923322683706
134146,5,0792153189,"As a huge fan and collector of disaster films, the movie, Deep Impact is one of the best of its kind as evidenced by its unique delivery.  With the help of our present day technology, the movie stirs a lot of emotions that  is deeply moving and believable.  Like always, Steven Spielberg did an  excellent job in this arena of real life images and special effects.
In  appreciation of the story itself, the movie has dual elements to describe  this kind of disaster.  It has the physical reality and the emotional side.  That's what the movie title is all about.  What does the physical reality  of an earth disaster have an impact to humanity?  The comet's strike  towards earth in this movie created a deep scar on its surface with the  impact that is so immensely great and made believable with this day and age  of cinematic technology.  There are a lot of imagery and camera tricks that  were put in by the producers that are so overwhelming to the audience. The  entrance of the comet through the earth's atmosphere, the mushroom cloud  that sifts during impact, the sudden change in weather, the emergence of  tidal waves that spread outward from the core of the impact and the  destruction of cities and inland are all wonderfully portrayed.  The  sequence of these events is just so precise.
The other side of the movie  is the emotional element.  This is where the inner beauty of the movie  comes in.  The dramatization is well-directed and well-casted with real  life characters.  The character set is one that I describe as not too well  known to the public with a notable exception of Morgan Freeman, who played  the perfect role as US President.  Freeman has this leading edge and  persona to play this special public figure which he did so excellent.  His  character in this movie puts the viewers into the real situation that later  nourishes and bonds us with hope through the experience of fear, trauma and  preparation.  Tia Leoni, who played the female lead, as the television  reporter as Jenny Lerner, is one of those unfamiliar faces who did so well  in this movie.  Vanessa Redgrave played the part as Jenny's troubled mother  who is coping through a divorce.  Her presence in this movie has  contributed a lot of this emotional impact between her troubled life and  the approaching disaster.  The family role models of Leo & Sarah with  their parents are also a spotlight in this film.  They were happy neighbors  and united as one niche despite a sad separation at the end between their  parents and children. The part where Sarah's parents come to face death  with the approaching tidal wave while holding each other without panic is a  sad and tearful moment. The NASA astronaut crew headed by Robert Duvall  played the rescue mission to deflect the comet.  Duvall's presence also  made it so special, as his persona as an action star.  Lastly, the casting  of extras who devote their parts of running and screaming for their lives  are real people that catches our fearful attention.
One thing I  have to comment is the superb musical score, which sustains the good  quality and delivery of this movie.  The musical quality I can describe is  again moving, which takes the audience into this real life situation of  accepting the facts of fear and uncertainty and how to overcome it with  hope.
All in all, the dedication that is put into the making of and  delivery of the movie, Deep Impact is excellent.  The magnitude of this  movie is believable that can happen and is deeply moving.  It is indeed a  collector's item for those who are into disaster flicks.",961977600,4,3592,4.703883495145631

I cried my eyes out, even when the sentimentality was over-the-top, as with the kid/romance subplot.  I  thought the emotional rendering of a core group of people you come to know  as the world is about to end was wonderfully done, and so movingly told.  Tea Leoni got a short shrift; her TV anchor was appropriately confounded,  disturbed and knocked out by the juxtaposition of her own success/ambition  coming about via the worst single disaster known to man.  The astronaut  sequences were well-done, and featured a small ensemble of strong acting,  lead by the reliable Robert Duvall.  It was refreshing to see Morgan  Freeman as a President you wish was your own.  James Horner's music moves  the multi-layered plot with deep emotion and color.  Though the movie  surely delivers knockout special effects in its final reel, this movie is  no Armageddon; expect a deep resonant response, one of the heart.  It makes  sense that this movie was directed by Mimi Leder; it has a woman's touch,  which for me brought it a sensitivity and compelling beauty.

This movie attempts to be a real teer jerker, and it mostly succeds.  A  well done disaster film and much better than Armageddon.  Some people may  not like it because it may not be what they were expecting, the movie can  get sappy at times trying to drain all the teers from our eyes it  can.

With a comet screaming toward Earth and  humanity fighting for its life, there is a realistic attitude toward the  struggle that bypasses any last minute, against all odds, miracles and  instead relies upon the human spirit to save the day. Deep Impact manages  moments of both hope and despair in ways that nearly brought me to tears.  This film is not about a comet. Nor is it about the heroes who save the  planet.

Despite this, it is refreshing once and  a while to see an intelligent, emotional ""disaster"" vehicle come along in  the name of the cerebral Deep Impact.
Deep Impact, while a blockbuster in  it's own right, is deeper, thought provoking and in many ways more intense  than Armageddon ever will be. Director Mimi Leder doesn't brush the special  effects aside, but merely emphasises its effects on the diverse selection  of characters dealing with the potential end of the world. Much more of an  emotional roller coaster ride, rather than an explosive one - but effects  fans are definitely not left out...and neither are the stars - Robert Duvall,  Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood and Morgan Freeman lead the major roles, while an  impressive supporting cast keeps things interesting that includes  established actors Maximilian Schell, Vanessa Redgrave and the ing&eacute;nue  Leelee Sobieski.

The inevitable concentration on the problems of individuals caught up in the growing disaster here focuses on people centrally related  to the discovery of the comet. They are IN the story for good  reasons.
The threat is real, and to a degree cannot be dodged. A comet is  coming, we cannot stop it, it arrives, and it does a lot of harm, and some  of the central characters perish, while others survive.
There is a  minimum of gooey treacle. The characters generally behave with a certain  nobility--just as we might hope to behave in similar extreme circumstances.  Sentimentality is generally avoided.
The plot is complete, the behavior  rational, and nothing of importance is dropped from the exposition. The  film is balanced, and we are not left with rip-roaring inconsistencies and  problems at the end.

134169,2,0792153189,"Some feel the action picture of the 1980's is now going the way of  ""classic rock""  music and I tend to agree. ""Deep Impact"" tries hard to recreate many of the steps to failure to which we've become accustomed as  this genre develops (and plays out) in the late 1990's. When your lead  character's parents have good-sized speaking parts, and they are played by  once-high-profile, and now grist mill fodder such as Maximilian Schell and  Vanessa Redgrave you may want to start to worry (although I'll admit Schell  did have a great turn in ""The Freshman""(1990)). I mean what, if any value  could these `parents' play in the story? It's fairly easy to predict that  our main character will be `flawed' but can't he just hit the bottle, or  just show some irregular sociopathic behavior?  Could I really care about  his (her) relation ship with mommy and daddy? Just pour some more  eFx on  top if you please.
Perhaps scripters Bruce Joel Rubin (My Life) and  Michel Tolkin (The Player), neither of whom have ever had the word `action'  associated with their writing offer a freshness with their script.  Preferring not to depend on a lead role, ""Deep Impact"" is entirely  story-driven--thankfully, since every time Tea Leoni takes the screen I get  that `fingernails on the chalkboard' feeling-can you say ""Flirting With  Disaster""?.
Have seen the film twice now, and must say I found it  perfectly agreeable although, aside from the `comet to hit earth--rescue  mission engaged--will the world survive?' normal story progression, I have  no idea really what the dang thing was about.

134170,3,0792153189,"Deep Impact could have been so much better, because the acting was really supurb Ex:(Morgan Freeman as the President), and a really engrossing story about a giant comet headed toward earth and hummanity's efforts to stop the  empending danger.  So what happens?  First the trailer lied, for in the  original theatrical trailer we see the comet colide with earth directly,  but in the movie the sceen was much different, so much in fact that it  pretty much causes Deep Impact to fall flat, and then there was the mission  to fire every available nuclear missle at the comet, naturally the mission  fails, but we are never told why, just that the mission failed.  My theory  is that the writters never really had a plausable execuse of why the  mission could fail, so they ommited this little detail.  Also after seeing  the trailer I was really disapointed, because the people that go to see  disaster flics, are there for that reason and that reason alone to see a  disaster flic.  With Deep Impact we really don't see a disaster, just a big  wave and the movie ends.  So now we have spent our time watching the movie  hopeing to see some really good special effects, and we do except there  over in about 30 seconds, then the movie ends, with little acomplished,  other than most of the cast dies.  Still I liked the movie and it still  fairs better than Armageddon, with good acting on most parts, and a good  story, except that it never really goes anywhere.",949449600,3,1462,4.599221789883268

Okay, so it fell down a few times, being a bit sugar sweet with the teenage marriage and the  daughter who reconciles with her father just before the killer tidal wave  hits.  However the special effects were good, the acting was not too bad  either, and there were one or two toughing moments that were fairly  realistic and not overly sugary.  I agree it is no Armageddon, but then did  it ever want to be like Armageddon?  I doubt it.  Both are distinct and  enjoyable films that just as watchable as each other for different reasons.  So if you want a fairly intelligent disaster movie, that tries its best to  be interesting and entertaining in the same breath, then watch Deep Impact.

This film has much stronger  character development than Armageddon, not to mention something that  Armageddon lacked entirely, namely a PLOT.

It seems like the writers threw that scene in just so that the  movie can start off with some kind of action.  Tea Leoni almost single  handedly torpedoes the movie...she was so unconvincing as a tv anchorwoman.  The film gives us an interesting novelty by giving us a black man as  president, and Morgan Freeman is a good actor, but the script doesn't give  him anything to do except make depressing speeches.  The scenes with the  astronauts setting the explosives in the meteor were alright, but are not  enough to rescue the movie.  Unlike many of the other reviewers who praised  the dramatic impact of the film, I found it to be uncompelling.

There are the riot scenes and partings and a lot of other  scenes that are 'obligatory' for an epic disaster film. A lot of people  like to look down on this film for doing that, but think about it, if the  end was coming, wouldnt there be mostly those kinds of things happening all  around? Actually, I give this film 4.5 stars and not a five because of one  thing. It lost courage to show something truly special on the cinematic  screen, and that was exactly what it set out to do. Show the extinction of  earth above ground and the subsequent means of survival. That would be a  bold direction rather than the one they did take, which was more  'Hollywood' than anything else.

134284,4,0792153189,"In March 12 1998, front pages across the nation and around the world contain a report from Brian Marsden of the International Astronomical Union in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who estimated a mile-wide asteroid was heading  toward Earth and expected to come startingly close to our planet on October  26, 2028. The report was quickly revised after further calculation that  asteroid XF11 will come within only 600,000 miles of Earth, beyond the  distance of the moon. Hollywood, gearing up to release two Earth-smashing  movies for the summer, couldn't hope for a better publicity stunt. But  considering research shows that every 10 million years, an asteroid or  comet has impacted Earth that drastically altered life on the planet, the  question is not if but when the next one will head directly our way, and  when it does, what can we do about it.
A $75 million collaboration  between DreamWorks and Paramount, that premise is explored in the  cataclysmic movie Deep Impact. Directed by TV veteran, Mimi Leder, whose  previous work was the directorial debut of The Peacemaker, the story is  grounded more in the human relationships and reactions when faced with  catastrophe and demise. Anyone who is looking for special effects  extravaganza and testosterone actions will be better served with  Bruckheimer's Armageddon, the other Earth-smashing movie of the same year.  Not that the special effects in Deep Impact are any less spectacular, it is  used with restrain and the result is much more devastating and profound.  While there are numerous subplots, the script by Bruce Joel Rubin and  Michael Tolkin focuses mainly on two families: ambitious reporter Jenny  Lerner (Tea Leoni) and high school astronomer Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood).  Both characters are well developed enough for us to share in their initial  panic, grieve, courage, and hope for survival.
For a summer movie, Deep  Impact is surprisingly unflinching in its depiction of doomsday  destruction.  There are no bravado heroes riding in at the last minute to  save the day, any attempts to successfully destroy the comet was met with  failure. Rather, people are face with what matters to them most and  sacrifices are made for the betterment of mankind. As the comet, or should  I say part of the comet, impacted the ocean, huge tidal wave swept inland  and taking with it lives and cities. It is difficult to keep a dry eye when  Jenny stood at the beach, holding tight to her father and say  ""Daddy..."" before they are swept away, but then we also rejoice  with those that survived and hope we will never have to face such  scenario.
Distributed by Paramount, the dual-layer DVD boasts a superb  transfer. Shot in Super 35, the film is presented in its theatrical ratio  of 2.35:1, 16x9 enhancement is not offered and pan and scan would severely  limit the effect of the destruction. Images are amazingly sharp and  detailed, such as during the landing on the coma, I can clearly see the  fine particles, debris and gases emitting away from the surface. Shadow  details on space and interior are clearly defined and blacks are superbly  deep. Colors are vivid and vibrant, and fleshtones are naturally rendered.  Digital artifacts are limited to few jaggedness on edges. The bulk of the  special effects were done by Industrial Light & Magic and for the most  parts look very impressive. The comet impact calls for the CG artists to  render some incredible imageries of biblical destruction. Some of the  memorable sequences include the comet streaking over the ocean, the  receding tide on the beach, and then of course, the enormous wave smashing  through the east coast. The science of the movie is also believable,  especially the microgravity effect experience by the astronauts and the  geysers cause by the sun on the coma.
Deep Impact might not be last  year's loudest movie, Godzilla and Armageddon are battling that out for the  title, however, the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack on the DVD creates for a  very realistic environment. The discrete effects are expertly mixed for  full envelopment of large crowd scenes and helicopters swirling overhead.  Imaging and panning are superbly projected on the shuttle's approach to the  comet with realistic debris flying from the front to rear channels. The  vibration and shake are so violent that I have to brace for the shuttle not  to fall apart. The bass is no pushover either, as during the shuttle's  blast off, detonation, and tidal wave, I have to grip the sofa, sit back  and feel the force. The score soundtrack by James Horner is rich in  fidelity and well integrated. As the follow-up to the Oscar winning score  in Titanic, I must admit that as a stand alone album, Deep Impact was a  letdown. A reason is the lack of recurring theme and the score in general  is quiet and somber. But after experiencing it with the film, Horner  demonstrated to me once again why he might just be the best among today's  composers. During the sad and emotional stages of the film, Horner's cues  never overstate the obvious. His orchestration subtlely supports the actors  and did not overpower their performances. The score is not one of his most  original, but it is very effective in the movie.

However, despite its brave intentions, Deep  Impact hardly manages to be more than average as a whole, primarily because  of the generally predictable nature of the plot. The acting is never too  expressive, and most of the characters are relatively stereotypical. The  idea of selective sheltering, taken straight from Dr. Strangelove, or: How  I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, does seem much more  convincing than in that film - yet this does not help the fact that it is,  after all, an idea taken from somewhere else.

134307,2,0792153189,"Of the two asteroid films of the past summer, I feel that Armaggedon was more entertaining.  Sure it is filled with cliched characters, outrageously unbelievable action, too many slow motion shots of old people and kids  running around Smalltown, USA, and that irritating and uninspired Aerosmith  song, but it was still a fun popcorn movie.  I don't think the creators  intended to make a very serious film.  With Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael  Bay at the helm, you know the film is going to be a pretty, action packed  feature with little story but lots of explosions.  This film is Space  Mountain meets a Nike commerical.
However the creators of Deep Impact  have attempted to make a more mature and serious film, looking at the  affect of such a global catastrophe not only on the small band of heroes  trying to save the Earth, but the common citizen as well (not just with  beforementioned slow mo shots reminiscent of long distance service TV ads -  see Armaggeddon).  It is a different and refreshing approach.  The film  starts off well, showing the government's response to such an event.  And  when the news goes public, the film effectively touches on the panic and  chaos that would result.  But as the day of reckoning approaches, the film  starts the downward spiral.  You would expect more chaos in light of such  an event, where every person is fighting to live.  In real life tragedies,  sadly, more often than not a person will step over another to save him or  herself, rather than stop to lend a hand.  In Deep Impact it felt like no  one wanted to live.  Everyone was so noble and self sacrificing.  Not very  realistic.
Perhaps I am taking an overly pessimistic view of people,  but I imagine many people would claw another's eyes out if it meant a  chance at getting to see another sunrise.
Like many films of today, the  director can't just present the story as it is, without forcefeeding  spoonfuls of sappiness down the viewer's throats.  If the events  surrounding such a catastrophe as a collision with a comet were presented  as it is, that alone would be enough to touch the viewer's emotions.  You  really don't need extended shots of middle aged couples embracing in the  face of certain death (how many of these were in this film?).  A good idea,  that could have been executed much better.  As for the story, well, what is  there to say really?  A comet on a direct collision with Earth.  The  acting?  Morgan Freeman was is usual boring self, playing wise, calm men  in the face of adversity.  He needs to take on some different and more  challenging roles.

Still, it falls  victim to typical Hollywood emotionalism and melodrama, and you just can't  help but crack a smile at the ""Ark"" mineshafts --- ""Mr.  President, we must not allow a mineshaft gap!!!""  (What Kubrickian  film was that from??!)",913075200,,412,5.246153846153846

I recently got Roku which has just as much if not more to offer and without the high cost like satellite and cable companies. Unfortunately these companies have such a hold on some favorite shows, ya can't watch them on Roku without a provider aka(Satellite or Cable).But I watched the movie as soon as I got it and absolutely loved it.
