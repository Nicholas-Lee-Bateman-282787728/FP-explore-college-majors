8517620,5,B007IKSNJ0,"I watched this video on YouTube with my 17 month old son until they recently pulled it.  I am glad to find it for sale.  It was a sure bet to get him calm during dinner, he would dance to the songs and eat calmly (he's not a picky eater, but doesnt like to sit still).  We speak Spanish and English at home.  I find the Spanish version to be so much more clever than the English one and I prefer the voices in Spanish too.  Hoping they'll get it back up on YouTube but if not, I am buying it for sure.  Not only is the video entertaining, the message is perfect.  I am a Family Practice doctor, and I know it's a problem that some kids just don't want to stop playing to go to the bathroom and that's the message here, stop what you're doing and go to the bathroom right away!",1365033600,,776,3.967741935483871
8517621,3,B007IKSNJ0,"I was a bit disappointed with this video because it was just a dubbed version of the English original. The lyrics and dialog don't sound as natural or don't rhyme as when it is done in the original language. Some of the songs are a bit annoying, sounds like they are screaming and totally out of tune. The content is ok and my 23 month-old son still pays attention, but he doesn't smile or laugh as much as he does with the other video ""Me gusta ser yo"". So, not the best video, wish they had more videos produced originally in Spanish.",1349654400,3,536,4.264705882352941
