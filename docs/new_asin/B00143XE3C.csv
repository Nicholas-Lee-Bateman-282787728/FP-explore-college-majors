8254230,3,B00143XE3C,This was taped during the prime of Maximova but the video quality is really horrible.  What bothers me the lost is a compression artifact that is unbearable for dark scenes.,1494720000,,173,4.766666666666667
8254231,4,B00143XE3C,"My favorite version of Romeo and Juliet is definitely Leonid Lavrovsky's, the first official version(except the one for Brno) of this great ballet, and this DVD is the only choice for the complete performance of Lavrovsky's choreography. The DVD featuring Ulanova(VAI) is an abridged version, and the Kultur DVD by Bessmertnova and Lavrovsly doesn't contain their whole performance. To be honest, I can't stand what Kultur had done to the film. The original playing time of the performance is about 150 minutes like that of Maximova and Vasiliev(VAI), but Kultur cut out about 40 minutes worth out of the film. The Bolshoi Ballet performed the whole of the work, and all of it was filmed without any part of it being cut out. Anyone who ever saw the whole of this very performance like on TV could see what I'm saying. I suspect why Kultur cut out 40 minutes is because they didn't want to make dual layered DVD(DVD-9) which can contain more than 120 minutes(up to 240 minutes). They just put in 108 minute performance in a single layered DVD(DVD-5) which can contain up to 120 minutes.

  Although this DVD(VAI) is not good in terms of the quality of video & sound and camerawork, this is the only complete performance of Leonid Lavrovsky's choreography, and Vasiliev's and Maximova's dancing and acting is simply the best. What else could I say about them?",1348272000,10,1358,4.819742489270387
8254232,2,B00143XE3C,"This should never have been released.  Two of the finest, most charismatic dancers in the world at the time this was taped, captured in some of the poorest lighting, fuzzy images and distorted sound imaginable!  It looks like a pirated edition except it was shot from several different camera perspectives.  Add to this, or rather subtract, minimalist, almost non-existent scenery and you get an idea of what you don't get. Too bad Ekaterina Maximova and Vladimir Vasiliev had not fled Russia with their compatriots!  Truly, a disappointment.  I had such high hopes for this!",1276992000,8,575,5.074468085106383
