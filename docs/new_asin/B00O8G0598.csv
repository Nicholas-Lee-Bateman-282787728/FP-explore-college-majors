6729151,4,B00O8G0598,"I think you generally find that people who like The Postal Service tend to really, really like them. And it's no wonder, with such a limited number of items they've put out in to the world.

I was fortunate enough to make it to the Detroit leg of their 2013 tour, and jumped all over the chance to get a piece of it to enjoy for years to come -- and at such an incredible price!

Admittedly, I wasn't terribly shocked when I watched it and saw that it was pretty much a recording of one of their shows, with a few disjointed interviews to break it up. To be honest, the interviews had an almost YouTube like nuance to them, which made the disc feel almost like it was a promo.

Another contention is that you get the pretentious ""A Film By Justin Mitchell"" on the cover, but really, there are a few points during the footage where it seems almost like he's just screwing around with Adobe After Effects. He's done better, and would have done better here by just giving us the footage without stupid kaleidoscope effects.

I didn't have quite the same disappointment in the audio that another reviewer did, but I'm also keeping the cost of the double-disc set in mind. Would I have appreciated a DTS HD/MA track? Without question. But getting HD video on a Blu-Ray for just over ten bucks is a steal, let alone with the inclusion of the DVD. So, I take it all with a grain of salt.

(Of course, Sub Pop being Sub Pop, we can probably expect a Give Up 15th Anniversary Edition that's the same as the 10th Anniversary Edition, but includes a remastered Everything Will Change disc and accompanying SACD.)",1417824000,2,1601,4.4135593220338984
6729152,4,B00O8G0598,"The only bad thing is, as others mention , that the blu-ray strangely only has dvd quality audio instead of dts-ma or similar. A sub pop mistake at the time of preparing the disc?",1417478400,2,179,4.294117647058823
6729153,3,B00O8G0598,"The Postal Service uniting for a 10th anniversary expanded reissue (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Give-Up-Deluxe-10th-Anniversary-Edition-2xCD/dp/B00BB5OLLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Give Up - Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition (2xCD)</a>) of their album and a tour was greeted with much excitement that resulted in eventual acclaim; thankfully we can relive that tour and gain additional insight into the unit's thoughts through this very well done concert film. There is not much in the way of super quick camera edits which I'm thankful for, no-one looks at a band performing and blinks their eyes rapidly while looking from one musician to another tilting their head at random so why do some idiots in the director's chair think it adds ""excitement"" to a live concert film? That's beyond me.

The picture quality on this Blu-ray is very good, the live shots are clear with very little in the way of artifacting visible. Where this disc falls flat on its face is in the audio department, which is the most important feature of a live concert! You can turn your TV off and listen to a live concert if you have one on DVD or Blu-ray (or VHS, etc) but you generally don't turn all your speakers off and watch it without sound. This is evidenced by how many live concerts are simultaneously released on CD or digital download, audio-only.

I was very excited to pick this disc up, I noted the back packaging stated ""English (5.1)"" but it didn't state the codec and there were no logos visible, I presumed given it's 2014 that this would have either LPCM, dts-HD Master Audio or Dolby TrueHD on it. WRONG! Much to my dismay my reciever told me it was Dolby Digital, checking the bitrate on my Blu-ray player I was dismayed to see it wasn't even 640 Kbps but rather DVD-quality 448 Kbps, not great for music, passable just about for film, not acceptable at all for surround sound music featuring active use of the surround channels. Perhaps they included a lossless LPCM stereo track? Nope, lossy Dolby again. They could have gone 448 Kbps for the stereo Dolby allowing much better fidelity and possibly undistinguishable from the master but they chose 192 Kbps.

I can't imagine this was intentional, it's Blu-ray! This is a recent show, that they mixed a 5.1 track and just used Dolby Digital for the Blu-ray is pretty inconprehensible. Not good Sub Pop. not goood at all. If you just want this for the archive then it's not a bad price, but unfortunately this one is probably going onto Amazon's marketplace as a ""Used - Like New"" item from me.

There are no licensing fees involved for LPCM so authoring the Blu-ray with a 5.1 PCM track would not have added anything to the cost of this project.",1417478400,13,2734,4.92407809110629
6729154,4,B00O8G0598,"Absolutely wonderful. Wish the sound quality wasn't so concert like but other than that, if you're a Postal Service or Death Cab fan, pick this up now. You get BOTH Blu-ray and DVD for a awesome price. You won't regret it.",1416873600,,222,4.439024390243903
6729155,5,B00O8G0598,"I went to the movie theater presentation of Everything Will Change to catch it early.  It is definitely worth the purchase and I look forward to receiving my copy.  Even though they have listed it as a documentary, it is mostly concert footage from the Berkeley Greek Theater performances at the end of the 2013 tour.  The shows at the Greek were incredible live and this film catches the vibe of those nights.  There are some brief interviews with Ben, Jimmy, and Jenny... just enough to tell the story but not interfere with the flow of the concert.  Considering Ben has stated that they will never perform again, this is a must-have for any Postal fan.",1416182400,3,655,4.612068965517241

Some of the bonus footage (interview) is not exclusive to the disc. If you love The Postal Service I can't imagine you wouldn't love this bluray.
