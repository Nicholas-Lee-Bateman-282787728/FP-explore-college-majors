makes great movies and Gerard Butler is really funny!
Glad I bought this and got to watch this movie!",1447804800,,196,4.628571428571429
8343545,4,B001UFGJZ4,"I love guy Ritchie films.  This movie had a decent flow and was reminiscent of ""lock stock and two smoking barrels"".  Only issue I had was the subplots did not mesh well as other Ritchie flicks.",1394064000,,194,4.361111111111111
8343546,5,B001UFGJZ4,"if you are a fan of guy ritchie, you will not be disappointed, very similar to his blockbuster snatch. Another thing, this movie gets better every time you watch it, there are many things you pick up that you may have missed. Lastly, highly recommend watching with subtitles since this is british, it is easier to follow since sometimes it is hard to understand what is said, butt once you know what was said, you can put the pieces together & realize how good it was.",1362355200,,468,4.453488372093023
