1759508,3,B00006HAZL,"This is an interesting movie if you want to understand the cruelty the Empress Dowager served to the people in her court.  The broken romance of the Emperor and a servant of the Empress was good.  However, some of the scenes in the movie didn't make sense, and the subtitles didn't either.  So unless you can speak Mandarin, there are some parts of the movie that definitely leave you saying, ""huh?""  Also, the movie, and the history books don't seem to agree on some a few points, so I am assuming the director took liberties to base the movie loosely on the life of the Empress Dowager.  The movie only covered about seven or so years of her life, so if you really want to know about her life, consult a history book - not this movie.",1169164800,10,736,4.343065693430657
1759509,4,B00006HAZL,"This director made two movies of this title (in English translation).  This is the 1989 ""Xi tai hou"" with actors Lui Xiao Qing, Gong Li (in a supporting role), Chen Dao Ming, and Li Yan.  It has Mandarin and Cantonese soundtracks, with subtitles in English (though with lots of typos and literal translations).

I am not Chinese, only a newer student of China culture and history.  The DVD is not as high quality as I am used to, some scratches on the film in parts.  But I am happy to have bought it and to have seen it.  The story is well told, I think, in a more Chinese way -- which I appreciate.  This applies to the writing and directing.  The acting is quite good, from any perspective.  The film is short at 94 minutes but packs a lot of content, with beautiful traditional costume, decor, achitecture, storytelling, song, allusions to BeiJing Opera, and history and cultural practices of many sorts.  I was familiar with Gong Li, from better known films she has done, Chinese and United States.  Here her role is a supporting role, but still a significant one.

The relationships between the Empress Dowagers (mothers of the emperor), and the young Emperor and his new wife, as well as the court intrigue among the others in the royal court were held my interest.

I felt it was a beautiful film, though somewhat foreign to me in its style and culture.  I appreciate it for teaching me much in a short time, in an enjoyable way, with such beauty and poetry.",1162944000,23,1466,4.524714828897339

7968980,2,B00006HAZL,"I cannot say I hated this movie being I ordered it twice just to make sure but neither DVD played in my DVD or my PS3.  Unless I missed it, it did not say have that ""Zone"" warning that other DVDs have to warn against it not playing on must U.S, DVD players.  I ordered 2 other DVDs with the same actress and my other 2 DVDs played just fine.",1484524800,,341,3.857142857142857
7968981,1,B00006HAZL,"I will happily change this negative comment if someone will tell me how to turn on the English subtitles.  I go to the Special Features Menu, toggle over to the Subtitles bubble, set the cursor next to ""English"" and ""off"" and press the OK button, but each time I get returned to the Main Menu and the subtitles remain off.  Is there any way to do it?",1478995200,,350,4.208955223880597

7968983,3,B00006HAZL,"Video quality isn't too great; but, considering the date it was produced, it's understandable. Acting is just as dated. Still, if you're a Gong Li fan, it's a must have.",1439596800,,169,4.666666666666667

7968985,2,B00006HAZL,"It is not as interesting as reading the book on the life of the Empress.
The DVD tends to be problematic at times.",1398729600,,114,4.0
7968986,4,B00006HAZL,"bought this movie being a Gong Li fan and while it was good, I don't think it is the best one she has been in.  I would still recommend it as it is better than average, particularly if you are a fan of Chinese films.",1358812800,2,216,3.8
7968987,2,B00006HAZL,"I am not who usually complains about subtitles for a foreign movie, but in this case the poor quality of the subtitles detracted from any possible enjoyment I might have gotten, This might have been a much better film than it seemed. The subtitles are terrible - not only is the English translation awkward, sometimes not even making sense, but also the subtitles are often on screen for such a short time that there is no time to read them. This made it very difficult to follow, not to mention that all nuances that might have been in the original were lost.",1356825600,6,560,4.5
7968988,5,B00006HAZL,"This movie is the second part of a three part series of DVDs and VCDs. The first part of the story, Chui Lian Ting Zheng, tells the early part of the story, the death of the Xian Feng Emperor and the struggle for the two Dowager Empresses to take power.

The second part of the story, this DVD, Xi Tai Hou, tells the story of the death of Tong Zhi, the son of Ci Xi, the Western Dowager Empress.

The third part of the story, Yi Dai Yao Hou, is the remainder of the story of CiXi, her murder of the Eastern Dowager Empress and the adoption of GuangXu and her own death.

This movie was shot in the Chinese palaces and gives a better tour of the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, the hunting lodge in Chengde and the Sea Palaces, than any documentary usually does.",1203897600,22,764,4.183673469387755
