3765403,4,B001QIP5DC,"Like other reviewers said, the movie gets better as it progresses. Not much of a story but the excellent acting is what makes this movie enjoyable.",1404259200,,147,4.6923076923076925
3765404,5,B001QIP5DC,"Really great story, really good actors and actresses.  This movie was a lot better than many supposed  ""A""  movies. The story was hard core with a lot of realism.  The lead actress was really good and played her part well, and looked like a regular person that you might pass in the street without realizing the burden they carry.

It was a five star movie for me and was way above the average.  I almost turned it off during the first 2 minutes because of a brutal scene.  Good thing I didn't.  Those first two minutes did not explain the sum of the whole movie, nor did it properly set the tone for the journey.",1403654400,3,613,4.269565217391304
3765405,1,B001QIP5DC,"This is not a very good film. The plot is weak, turning points are also weak. It's as though it was written in a hurry, or for a school project. I can empathize with that but come on, try harder.
The editing wasn't terrible, i liked that they got creative by using some jump cuts and such.",1400544000,2,289,4.087719298245614
3765406,1,B001QIP5DC,"OMG...this was a bad movie.  I had to keep skipping forward just to get through it.  Incest, blah blah blah.  Crazy mothers, blah, blah, blah.  You would think with this kind of material, the movie would have been watchable.  WRONG!!!  I am removing this one OUT of my watchlist as I type.  HORRIBLE movie!  Geesh!",1397260800,7,314,4.581818181818182
3765407,5,B001QIP5DC,"From the beginning to the end, Junction is weirdly fabulous. Who doesn't have secrets? And the scenery us stunning. Great movie.",1394582400,2,128,5.142857142857143
3765408,4,B001QIP5DC,"I liked it. Obviously low budget, and the acting was not very good, but the story was interesting and drew me in. The characters seemed real. One might be tempted to turn it off right away, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Had the acting been better I would have rated it 5 stars.",1392595200,,280,4.017857142857143
3765409,5,B001QIP5DC,"Great plot. Great theme, great actors. Kept me watching the entire time. Really enjoyed this movie. Keep your eyes open!",1391731200,3,120,5.05
3765410,4,B001QIP5DC,"Junction is a movie of two women, Michaela and Victoria, their strange mothers, and the even stranger men in their lives.  I would give it an ""R"" rating, with TV codes A, V, L, S.  Women may like this movie because of the strong female characters.  Men may like the movie because of several sexual situations, though there is no actual nudity.

Michaela is a photographer who lives with her alcoholic and seriously ill mother.  Victoria is a college student who lives with her mentally ill mother Beverly, who is terrified of Pilgrims.  Michaela and Victoria share a connection that neither is aware of at the beginning of the movie.  Their life paths will collide.

The movie starts poorly, in my opinion, with a weird sound-only start interrupted by flashes of video violence.  This scene is a flash-forward to a climactic scene late in the movie.  But the movie steadily gets better, even though the lives of the women at the beginning are extremely depressing.

Shane is a handsome young college student with a surprising background, a willing object of a seduction. Chris is a handsome cactus store owner who knows some secrets. `The Danimal' writes papers for women for sexual favors.  Jeff is a critical mentor for Michaela. And James plays a short but very key role.

Michaela has good facial expressions and can look cute and has an inner glow.  Victoria is a beautiful young women long curly hair.  She shows a broad range of emotion, with subtle expression and vocal intonation.  She's very sweet and innocent in one scene, and cruelly scheming in another.  Has she inherited some of her mother's craziness?

The movie ends much better than it starts, and is entertaining throughout.  Very good camera work and cinematography with beautiful Arizona desert scenes.  The rare music is very well done and adds a lot to the emotion of the scenes.  A very decent little film.",1245456000,17,1881,4.815625

8335794,1,B001QIP5DC,I simply could not get over the fact that the main character- the photojournalist  -whatever her name is: Had clearly never even seen a 35mm SLR  Or even imagined one! yet she continued to carry it around with her throughout the movie CASTING should have CALLED ME!,1417996800,,265,4.617021276595745

8335796,3,B001QIP5DC,"One has to be appreciative of indie films to appreciate this. It is strangely compelling as you try to figure out where it is going. The mystery is confusing as it unfolds, I had to return to the first review after viewing it to fully understand the plotline. Decent acting and dialogue. It is worthy and a good indie effort.",1414281600,,325,4.433333333333334
