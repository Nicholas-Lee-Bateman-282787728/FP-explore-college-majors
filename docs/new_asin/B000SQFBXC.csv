8206281,4,B000SQFBXC,"I am thoroughly impressed with the ""Baby Road Trip"" series...and so is my 23 month old.  She started watching this series when she was 18 months old and she can count, knows shapes, colors, and words for things I didn't think was possible for a 1 year old.  We have the whole series and her favorite is ""City"" and ""Circus.""  It's even fun for parents to watch now and again.  It has alot of variety and isn't too ""ADD."" And the price is right!!  Thank you amazon!!",1267747200,,464,4.287356321839081
