7911393,5,B00000IQXN,This is the ONLY video you will EVER learn Tai Chi from because it has a reverse view (ie. filmed from the back and NOT from the front which is backwards.) Do not hesitate and waste your money on ANY other Tai Chi video because you will never learn from it unless you view the video in front of a mirror. This is the Yang style long form taught by a master. BUY IT,1384905600,2,364,3.9324324324324325
7911394,5,B00000IQXN,I found the Reverse View approach to be a perfect approach when teaching T'ai Chi...Claire Hooton is a fantastic intructor.,1376611200,2,123,5.2
7911395,4,B00000IQXN,Claire Hooten continues the reverse method of teaching. I find that is the best way to learn Tai Chi. Claire and her to assistants are easy to follow. it just takes some time.,1316476800,,175,4.333333333333333
7911396,3,B00000IQXN,"I found the DVD easy to follow. Claire Hooton does a good job of explaining each movement, when to pick up which heel, when to move to 70-30 position in relation to arm movements, etc... It is more than just positioning of the body, but exactly how to flow into the those positions. I also enjoyed the beginning 6 Tai Chi principals. A good DVD for beginners.",1250380800,2,359,4.373134328358209
7911397,1,B00000IQXN,"Both the beginer and intermediate level DVDs are very uninspiring.  When watching taichi demonstration by great masters (performers) I feel inspired and very motivated to practice hard. When watching Claire Hooton's performing Tai Chi I don't even have the feeling that I'm watching taichi.  I doubt that advanced tai chi practicioners would get something from these DVDs.  As for beginers and intermediate practicioners, they need to see clean, large movements because this is what they understand.  The underlying principles become clear only after years of practice. But one cannot practice unless they understand at least the kinetics behind tai chi. This kinetics is not clear at all in these DVD presentations.",1143936000,4,716,5.423423423423423
7911398,5,B00000IQXN,"After seeing and using the beginners tape I wanted to go further in the movements.  I like this intermediate one as well as the beginners tape.  The ""Reverse View"" is an excellent technique method!!!",1123200000,2,199,4.823529411764706
