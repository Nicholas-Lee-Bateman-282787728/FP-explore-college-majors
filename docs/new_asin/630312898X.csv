577366,5,630312898X,"I just love Columbo! I think it's a great detective show, and I'm very pleased to see the second season is (soon) available. I am not one for special features, and bonuses, so that part doesn't bother me, but I'm not fond of the amount of chapters. Some Half hour sitcom shows offer 10 chapters, this only offers 4.

But that is no reason to not buy Columbo. Even if they had no chapter cuts, it's still a GREAT buy!",1109462400,6,416,4.2
577367,5,630312898X,"I love Columbo, and the second season is easily one of the best of the series. ""Oh, and, uh, pardon me sir, just one more thing,"" that isn't John Cassavettes in Etude in Black, it's an actor named Peter DuPre.",1109289600,,209,4.25
577368,5,630312898X,"Been a Columbo fan for so long, I have seen all these episodes

over and over again in VHS. Already own my first season in DVD

and I'm glad that it is being released the second with one hope

in mind, that the seasons ahead would also be scheduled for the

near future. Peter Falk is amazing, simple, funny, humble,

absent minded but very smart. This is a short review I'd wish

to share of the episodes included in the second season, forgive

me if some information is not correct.

1.-ETUDE IN BLACK: Features John Cassavettes (from the classic

""Rosemary's baby"") as an orchestra director that has a love

affair with one of the musicians. Great episodes that marks the

debut of Lt. Columbo as a piano player.

2.-GREENHOUSE JUNGLE: Outstanding performance by Oscar

winner Ray Milland (from 1945's ""The lost weekend"") who arranges

a fake kidnaping.

3.-MOST CRUCIAL GAME: Robert Culp is featured here as a

fotball team's chairman who manages to leave the stadium in the

middle of a game to murder someone disguised as an ice cream

salesman.

4.-DAGGER OF THE MIND: Columbo finds himself in England and

helping actor Bernard Fox to solve a crime committed inside a

teather. Richard Baseheart (from El Quijote) also stars in this

episode.

5.-REQUIEM FOR A FALLING STAR: Another Oscar winning is

featured, Ann Baxter from ""All about Eve"", plays the role of an

actress who tries to kill a blackmailing friend.

6.-STITCH IN CRIME: Great episode it features Will Geer from

the Waltons and Leonard Nimoy from Star Treck. Nimoy tries

desesperately to kill Geer but finds in his way a smart nurse

that puts him in trouble, and him at the same time, puts Lt.

Columbo into so much trouble that he almost loses the case.

7.-MOST DANGEROUS MATCH: Another excellent episode and

a great performance of Laurence Harvey who plays a chess

player who finds out he would not be able to beat his

opponent in a major chess championship match so he decides

to murder him.

8.-DOUBLE SHOCK: What can I say about this one?, Excellent ,

it features the great actor Martin Landau playing a double role

as the Paris twin brothers who consipre to kill their uncle.

PS.- After all this, I don't need extras",1109030400,271,2206,4.690288713910761
577369,5,630312898X,Season One was well worth the wait - and I expect nothing less from Season Two.  I only hope that the other seasons are not far behind.  I am a huge Columbo fan and so far no dust has collected on the first installment.,1108944000,6,219,3.9545454545454546
577370,5,630312898X,Oh Yeah! Can't wait either for this gem of a classic. Season 1 is just a pure work of art. Columbo is the BEST! I agree with the other folks. Don't worry about the extras as much as getting these seasons out. There were 7 seasons total and I will have every one of'em when it's all said and done!,1108684800,6,296,3.95
577371,5,630312898X,"For all of us Columbo fans, it is good to see the second season being released. We have already seen the episodes of season two, and all of them are worthy of 5 stars. I just hope they have a few extras added to this set. It would be great to have a Peter Falk interview included, while he still is available to be interviewed. On March 8th this will be in my collection!! Keep them coming!!!",1105488000,7,392,4.103896103896104
577372,5,630312898X,"Thank you for the quick turnaround for Season 2 of the best detective show, EVER!  Season 1 has been a constant in my DVD player.  Season 2 episodes are just as amazing as Season 1. Besides the amazing and wonderful Peter Falk, we've got Robert Culp, Ray Milland, Leonard Nimoy, Martin Landau and on and on.  To all the complainers about lack of extras, WHO CARES!  If the lack of extras means more of a chance for more seasons...  Think, people!  Anyways, I can't wait until March 8!  Please keep them coming, Universal!",1104969600,5,521,4.537634408602151
577373,3,630312898X,"I loved the Columbo series.  This was one of the smartest running shows on television and I had only wished they would have made more.  The deductive and inductive reasoning in almost all episodes is a perfect way to teach social science methodology, which I do.  However, this episode is a bit disappointing.  I know that saying so is somewhat sacrilege because it was the first of the NBC episodes and directed by Speilberg.  However, there is substantially less Columbo in this Columbo than almost any other episode.  Jack Cassidy is the real focus.  And Columbo's victory over Cassidy's character is not arrived at in the usual deductive method.  There is much more induction and luck here.  After this episode, the writers allowed for more step-by-step logic, thereby giving Falk's acting skills a chance to shine.",1016150400,10,819,4.963235294117647
577374,5,630312898X,"Though many remember and enjoy Columbo (and rightly so), few may remember Barbara Colby who skillfully plays blackmailer/murder victim Lily LaSanka in this episode. Ms. Colby was a gifted actor, with an earthy sexiness, who made a name for herself on the stage. In the early seventies she brought herself and her talent to broader audiences through her work on television. Twice she played a hooker named Sherry on the ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"", with hysterical results. So well liked was she by the MTM team, that she was cast as Julie Erskine on the hit spin-off series ""Phyllis"". The comic chemistry between Cloris Leachman and Colby was magical. Together with Richard Schaal they had a unique and wonderful energy that showed great promise. But tragedy struck...shortly after the third episode of ""Phyllis"" was in the can, Barbara Colby was murdered in a drive-by shooting incident that remains unsolved to this day. This Columbo vhs offers you the rare chance to view this remarkable woman at work...she is perfect as Lily, all false modesty and big Cheshire Cat grins. Short of that there is the wonderful Jack Cassidy (who had an untimely death himself); and the magnificent Peter Falk as Columbo.  P.S.  Many people believe that Falk's portrayal of Columbo to be based on Lt. Kinderman, as portrayed by Lee J. Cobb in ""The Exorcist""; the author of the novel, William Peter Blatty, certainly thinks so! I must say, I agree that there is a definate simialarity! Check it out! And if you can, check out the first three episodes of ""Phyllis""; the series was erratic in quality, but the first three shows are classic television at it's best..it would have been a very different show had Colby survived.",997574400,5,1703,4.889273356401384
577375,5,630312898X,"This is arguably the best of the Columbo TV mysteries.  Columbo takes on veteran bad guy Jack Cassidy in their subtlest game of cat and mouse.  Columbo piles on mind game after mind game as Cassidy slowly succumbs to  the inevitable.  In addition to being one of the earliest Columbo films,  this one is directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Steven Bochco.  The  price alone here makes it worth your while.",958694400,6,412,4.638888888888889

578137,5,630312898X,"I am not going to lie, I doubt very seriously that any of the cases made by Columbo in this season would have resulted in convictions. The evidence is weak, even though we know they did it. But hey, that is what we love about Columbo. 1. He inherently knows it was murder and who did it before anybody else could possibly know. 2. He always finds one little trick to get the murderer to confess. However, if the defendants ""lawyer up,"" they will walk in court. Season 2 does get a little self-indulgent in my opinion and is not as strong as season 1. More star power, but not as well developed stories. Still, it is Columbo, one of the greatest shows ever, starring the great, great, great, Peter Falk.",1438560000,,702,4.366412213740458

This second season continues the then tradition breaking plot of letting the viewer see who  done it while keeping Columbo in the dark. And in this season even the viewer gets thrown a delightful curve ball in the Martin Landau classic included in these episodes.  You can follow the psychological warfare that Columbo wages with the always conceited and ""I am smarter than this dumb cop"" upper class killer. Columbo needless to say always gets his man or woman as the case may be. And and along the way the trench coated rust bucket convertible drivin' detective solves a cold case in season two long before this became a popular genre.

It is fun seeing the movie stars in the episodes included.  The wardrobes, the furnishings, the large portable phones and the dated detective techniques are fun to watch.  I lived through that time so I can relate. Younger viewers (twenties/thirties) might find Columbo boring compared to the CSI dramas of today but I never tire watching him do his craft.",1361664000,2,497,4.689655172413793

579016,5,630312898X,"The Columbo movies take a different approach to mysteries.  Most of the time the viewer watches as the detective finds clues and tries to figure out who did it.  But with Columbo we see the murder and know who did it.  The game is watching Columbo find clues to figure out who did it.  There are no exciting car chases.  There are no gun battles.  Columbo is able to look at simple small clues and make important deductions.  It is a thinking man's game.

These movies are also fun on another level.  Columbo is a likeable person.  He comes across as a bit average and maybe even incompetent.  Rarely does the villain worry tell after Columbo starts piecing together the clues.  He will badger the villain with ""Just one more question.""

Season two has eight movies.  One of my favorites is ""A Stich in Crime"" with Leonard Nimoy as the doctor who operated to kill a colleague.  I also enjoyed ""Dagger of the Mind"" as Columbo takes a trip to England and ends up helping Scotland Yard.

If you have never watched a Columbo movie before, you are in for a treat.  They are fun movies.",1303689600,3,1080,4.428571428571429

I'm pleased to report they still have the old charm and have stood the test of time with flying colors! For those who are too young to remember the time when they were first show on TV, you have a treat in store; these shows have class and style and create a detective personality, played by Peter Falk, who is impossible to forget.

As a lover mysteries, I came across Columbo in my search.  I have never seen an entire season, only ones here and there.  Planning to buy the entire series, I'm on the second, which I can only say is as great as the first.  I really enjoy the plot sequence, the crime first, and then our ""far from looking"" cunning detective set out to expose the murderer.  It's fun to play along, see if I can spot the clues.  Even better is a great cast from the past.  I will always say that while there's some great TV/Movie's today, these gems from the past can't be beat.

For starters you are forced to watch the fake FBI threat for quite a while, unable to fast-forward to the episode you paid for. This well-known threat appears on each DVD and on the box; no need to ram it down the throat of viewers also. As if this onus is not enough, you are then forced to watch numerous previews of other shows: essentially to watch ads you have to pay for. Next, you watch previews of the episode itself that give hints to the plot, thus robbing you of the pleasure of anticipating the story. Last, the DVD's do not carry a description of their contents; you have to refer to the box to find out what each contains.",1246492800,7,729,4.488721804511278

579211,4,630312898X,"There are few mystery shows that I tend to watch over again but Columbo is one of them. I bought Columbo for the British"" Dagger of the Mind"" partly taken off of William Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" set in 1970s London, England with an acting couple playing the leads onstage and offstage. The guest cast includes Bernard Fox, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Honor Blackman and Richard Basehart.

Anyway, there are other treasures here and one of my favorites if ""Etude in Black"" with John Cassavetes and Blythe Danner with Myrna Loy about an American conductor who kills his mistress.

Of course, one of the hilarious moments is when Columbo meets his match in Jeanette Nolan who plays a devoted, immaculate housekeeper in ""Double Shock"" with Martin Landau playing identical twin brothers. Julie Newmar also appeared as the bereaved fianc&eacute;.

 ""The Most Crucial Game"" stars Robert Culp and Dean Stockwell as a football team owner and manager who thinks he is gotten away with murder. Valerie Harper, James Gregory and Susan Howard also appear in this episode Then there is the one episode, ""The Most Dangerous Match,"" with chess starring Laurence Harvey as a star chess player who is against the Russian champion.

Of course, Leonard Nimoy plays a diabolical doctor in a ""Stitch in Crime"" with Anne Francis and Will Geer. Now for English teachers who want to teach Shakespeare, I would recommend ""Dagger of the Mind"" for the honors or advanced group of kids. I do love Anne Baxter in ""Requiem of a Fallen Star"" with Edith Head in a cameo.

There are no extra special features in this DVD set of four DVDs in the case.",1181001600,5,1607,4.846715328467154

I was somewhat anxious before watching MURDER BY THE BOOK because I feared that the pleasure I had, during the seventies, to watch Columbo on TV was only associated with my teen years and hadn't pass the test of time. How was I wrong ! The quality of this episode is undeniable, even measured according to our actual standards. Steven Spielberg, who directed MURDER BY THE BOOK, was already yeasty in his direction. He managed to create a suspense drama during the first 15 minutes of the episode while everybody had already understood, since the first 15 seconds of MURDER BY THE BOOK, that Jim Ferris would be murdered by Ken Franklin. The suspense simply lied in the fact that we didn't know how Ferris would do it. Spielberg, with a few Hitchcockian scenes, compelled us to successively believe that Franklin was meant to die poisoned, drowned and shot to death.

Peter Falk is perfect and Jack Cassidy, as the villain, also top-notch. A special mention though to Barbara Colby who, in the role of the blackmailer Lilly LaSanka, shines in all the scenes she appears in.

But, as one looks back, it is clear that only a few TV series -- including Remington Steele and Columbo -- stood out sharply from the crowd as both unique in concept and very well done."" Columbo was definitely unique in concept and went beyond very well done, it was outstanding. Peter Falk was superb as Columbo and deserved the Emmy awards he received for this role, but each episode was also very well written and directed and the guest stars were consistently outstanding. Quite simply, Columbo was TV drama at its best.

Furthermore, the development of the plot is more plausible and interesting.

This DVD has episodes that are all good to great.  Ray Milland, Leonard Nimoy, and Robert Culp are fine gueststar murderers.  Not only are the episodes more vivid and believable than the first season, the variety of situations and occupations embellish these adventures as well.  The clues and his solutions also unfold better in the second collection. The episodes are also engaging (as always) because we are left guessing how Columbo will solve the cleverest of crimes.

579383,5,630312898X,"I was a young student in graduate school and newly married when these shows were aired in 1972. We eagerly watched Columbo on our fuzzy black and white TV. Now a third of a century later I get just as much pleasure out of this series as I did then. (On the LCD flat screen to boot) Part of the fun is seeing some of the top stars of a generation ago. Most of Columbo's findings would never stand up in court, and I doubt that most suspects would confess openly to a capital crime at the end and toast the detective's brilliance. But then, we're here to have a good time, and watching Peter Falk's brilliant portrayal of the clever sleuth who presents himself as a bumbler.
  There's a bit of a time capsule effect here too. I was amused to see the John Cassavetes character as the world famous conducter living in a spectacular Los Angeles mansion with the columns and Tara-like staircase. Columbo says ""I bet you paid 700 thousand for this place"" and the conducter proudly responds with ""seven-fifty"" as the detective puts his hand to his forehead in disbelief at the extraordinary expense.

579384,5,630312898X,"This is an excellent season of ""Columbo,"" perhaps the best season overall with the exception of season three. The set contains eight episodes which are all good, but most are absolutely great.

Of the eight episodes featured here, my favorite is ""A Stitch in Crime"" starring Leonard Nimoy as a ruthless doctor. This episode is probably the best work Nimoy has ever done, and the plotting and pacing of the script are faultless. Likewise, ""Etude in Black"" starring John Cassavetes is superior in every way, and has the bonus of featuring a young Blythe Danner in a strong performance in a supporting role. I enjoyed Robert Culp in ""The Most Crucial Game,"" and particularly enjoyed the sleuthing technique Columbo used to ferret out the criminal in this fine episode. ""Dagger of the Mind"" is a bit novel in that it features Columbo out of his element, as he is guest help on a murder investigation in England. This episode, needless to say, features many comedic moments as Columbo attempts to interact with British aristocracy.

On the other end of the spectrum, I found disc four to be average, and the weakest of the four overall. The two episodes ""The Most Dangerous Match"" and ""Double Shock"" seemed plodding by comparison to the first six, although I know many others disagree with me. I did enjoy seeing Martin Landau in a double role as two squabbling brothers in ""Double Shock,"" but honestly found the nearly continuous antagonistic exchanges between Columbo and the housekeeper to be extremely annoying. I could have lived with them if they had furthered the plot, but they were apparently intended for comic relief, and had no particular bearing on furthering the story. It was my least favorite episode of the eight.

While extras are notably missing (and would be very nice), I highly recommend this set as being a superior season of the greatest detective show in television history.",1134691200,,1894,4.894080996884735

This is another one of the shows I loved growing up and couldn't wait for it to come to DVD.  Peter Falk created an unforgettable character.  Even though you knew right at the beginning who did it - the fun was watching Columbo go through the motions (he knew his suspect from the start) and make them tie the noose around their own necks.

579438,5,630312898X,"The formula of Columbo never changed during its initial seven-year run on NBC throughout the 1970's. Why should it? TV audiences loved it, NBC cleaned up in the ratings and Peter Falk won several Emmy's for his work. The gimmick was classic, but never seemed to grow old. A killer tries to commit a seemingly perfect crime, only to discover that he/she was not prepared for the disheveled, cigar-chomping detective who was never quite as dumb as he seemed. Part of the appeal of Columbo is watching the clash of the classes. Columbo is very much a blue-collar figure, while the murderers he often pursues are rich, intelligent and cunning. From snobbish symphony conductors to greedy football team managers, Hollywood actresses, skillful surgeons, crafty chess masters and even a pair of murderous identical twins, Columbo matches wits with them all and none of them prevail in the end. It would seem to be nothing less than cornie by today's standards, but Peter Falk's portrayal, along with top guest stars like Leonard Nimoy, Robert Culp, Ray Milland and John Cassavetes, and clever plots make this mystery series timeless in deed. Some stories are weaker than others, but overall, this series never jumped the shark and remains a classic. If you liked Season One, you'll like this and all other seasons as well.

Any flaws in this package come from Universal and not the series itself. The studio can't seem to make up its mind what kind of casing it wants to use. I'm also tired of having to wade through promos for other shows on the first disc before I make it to the main event. Why no extras? Can't we get even a small interview from Mr. Falk? I applaud Universal for including the short teaser before each episode this time around, but am annoyed that they chopped out the original logo at the end of the show. Still, these are minor complaints and won't detract from the enjoyment of the programs.",1123286400,5,1908,4.746987951807229

579444,4,630312898X,"There were few happier sights on 1970s network television than that of a short, stocky, cigar-chomping policeman named Columbo. Always absentminded (and never without his raincoat, even in sunny weather), Peter Falk's Columbo character was a perfect Americanization of several eccentric British detectives. In each episode, Columbo would steadfastly wear down the alibis of high society murderers. Usually he worked only with simple, unfailing logic but Columbo never failed to unmask the murderers in any of the Agatha Christie-inspired adventures of his 1970s TV series. These episodes aren't perfect, but we can always count on Falk to carry us through the weaker scripted moments.

Season Two is arguably the strongest of the seasons. The writers had settled into a comfortable formula for the detective, yet were not so comfortable that the formula seemed tired or obvious. Falk had hammered out most of the details of his portrayal, yet was still new enough to the character that his performances always seemed fresh. And, while the series always boasted high quality guest stars and gifted character actors, Season Two had an unusually high concentration of them. Myrna Loy, Ray Milland, Martin Landau, Leonard Nimoy, Julie Newmar, and Anne Francis are here in all their glory, happily chewing up the scenery.

In addition, we get brief looks at a Los Angeles that has largely fallen to the wrecking ball, and an extended look at mainstream 1970s fashion for the retro-minded!

The picture and sound are about as good as you can expect from a 1970s TV program. Columbo was filmed, not videotaped, so while the image is still rich it's also grainy at times. There are no extras, which will irk many. Given the relatively low price of this set and lack of goodies, I was happy to see that Universal at least gave us subtitles. An interview with Peter Falk would have been nice; I hope one is included in a future set, but I doubt it.

No one ever claimed that Columbo was a realistic documentary-style police drama. If you enjoy Agatha Christie whodunits, or the PBS ""Mystery!"" series, you will find much to enjoy in this charming boxed set.",1114300800,19,2146,4.969359331476323

579515,5,630312898X,"Here's a run-down of the episodes on ""Columbo -- the Complete Second Season:""

1.) ""Etude in Black"" (96 min.) (4/5 Stars) John Cassavetes (from ""The Dirty Dozen"") stars as a conductor who murders his mistress because she threatens to tell his wife. This is a quite good segment; Cassavetes makes a formidable villain.

2.) ""The Greenhouse Jungle"" (74 min.) (2.5/5 Stars) Ray Milland plays Jarvis Goodland, a crotchety old man who schemes to get money from his nephew's trust fund with murder in mind. I was surprised by how boring this segment is, but it's definitely worth watching to catch two of Star Trek's best guest-beauties: Sandra Smith and Arlene Martel. Remember Sandra from Trek's very last episode ""Turnabout Intruder"" wherein she played the psycho chick? Sandra is incredibly ravishing in this columbo episode (unlike in the Trek outing). And, of course, Arlene played the Vulcan beauty T'Pring in the popular segment ""Amok time."" Macho-man William Smith is also on hand.

3.) ""The Most Crucial Game"" (74 min.) (5/5 Stars) Robert Culp stars as a football manager who murders the team's rich-punk owner disguised as an ice cream man, of all things. This is a very engrossing episode. James Gregory, Valerie Harper (Rhoda) and Susan Howard co-star. Susan, incidentally, was the only woman to play a Klingon on the original Star Trek; catch her in ""Day of the Dove"" as Mara.

4.) ""Dagger of the Mind"" (96 min.) (2/5 Stars) Richard Basehart and Honor Blackman star as annoying theater actors who accidently kill the businessman who is financing their careers. I obviously didn't enjoy this one much; Basehart and Blackman really grate on the nerves as they play their roles so over-the-top they seem cartoony. Hopefully I'll enjoy this segment more in repeat viewings when I pay closer attention.

5.) ""Requiem for a Falling Star"" (74 min.) (3/5 Stars) Anne Baxter plays a movie star who attempts to murder her adulterous husband, but terribly botches the job. Average.

6.) ""A Stitch in Crime"" (74 min.) (5/5 Stars) Leonard Nimoy stars as a doctor who comes up with a brilliant scheme to murder his older partner who is preventing him from publishing their questionable discoveries. The problem with his plan is that a nurse (Anne Francis) discovers his scheme and so murders her first. This is one of the best, most captivating Columbo segments. Everyone knows Nimoy as ""Spock"" from Star Trek, and Francis was the cute little tart on the classic ""Forbidden Planet.""  Will Geer, Grandpa Walton, is also on hand.

7.) ""The Most Dangerous Match"" (74 min.) (4/5 Stars) A deaf chessmaster, played by Laurence Harvey, murders his elderly opponent before a big match because he realizes he can't beat him. Very good episode.

8.) ""Double Shock"" (74 min.) (4.5/5 Stars) Martin Landau has a double role as twins who hate eachother. Their rich uncle is murdered and Columbo has to determine which one is guilty since they both stand to inherit his fortune. This is a great episode highlighted by super sexy Julie Newmar, ""Catwoman"" on TV's campy Batman series.

SPECIAL NOTE: There are NO extras on this compilation except trailers which appear at the start of each segment; there's not even a booklet. I'm not upset 'cause I personally only care about the episodes.

579516,5,630312898X,"First, I do like the new package design. The 2 hard-shell cases fit nicely into the sleeve (complete with episode synopsis), better than the awkward foldout from season one if less colorful. What I don't like is the artwork. Why are there pictures adorning this set from the mid-nineties (just a guess)? Are there NO still pictures available in the Universal archive from Season 2? Seems unlikely. I would like each set to represent the exact place in time they inhabited, instead it seems like an 11th hour dig through publicity photo's. Sad. The disc artwork is decent but seems a bit generic, and doesn't seem to capture the true ""spirit"" of the show. Each disc should portray a memorable locale from an episode on the disc; like Robert Culps private box overlooking the stadium, the fountain in Requiem, etc.

Having said this, you know you want this and you know there is no way I cannot endorse the brilliance of Peter Falk. The picture is near perfect and the sound, while only Dolby Digital 2.0, is strong and clear... still the shortcomings linger, like the price which seems a bit steep for only 8 episodes. It does make me wonder how they will package some of the future seasons, some of which only had 3-5 episodes.

1)Etude in Black (4 Stars) - (96 min.) Since this is a 96 minute episode my local network has never ran this one so this is welcome new ground for me! Not sure why the lengths tend to vary, but I'm pleased. This really is a great one. John Cassavetes is definitely an animated foe and Blythe Danner's throaty haughtiness still gets to me. The story is interesting, the pacing is generally quite good, I only lopped a star off because judging from the first two acts I thought Cassavetes was truly going to be a juggernaut of denial to the bitter end and yet in the final act he went out more with a whimper than a bang.
Columbo Moment: Columbo's near constant subject changes (rents, cars, room sizes) each time he would mention he had something important to say about ""the case.""

2)The ""Solarium"" Jungle (2.5 Stars) - (74 min.) Despite this being a supposed ""fan favorite"" and in spite of my love for all things Sandra Smith, I seem to like this one less and less with each viewing. Several performances are just lacking; the kidnappee, the ""boyfriend"", etc. I tend to rate my Columbo's based on the demeanor of the rival and Ray Milland just doesn't capture the essence of the great Columbo villains. He is certainly far from the worst but falls somewhere in the middle.
Columbo Moment: Columbo's many exchanges with prot&eacute;g&eacute; Sgt. Wilson on the newest techniques for solving crimes, along with his tumble down the steep hill.

3)The Most Crucial Game (5 Stars) - (74 min.) If there is one thing Peter Falk must know, it's that the measure of his success depends largely on ""the chase"". My personal favorite in this regard is none other than Robert Culp. Shrewdly cautious, paranoid and yet generally optimistic no one quite captured the feeling of the chase like Mr. Culp. Though I preferred his season one performance this one is still head and shoulders above his rival rivals. If Ray Milland is middle of the road at rush hour, Robert Culp is the express lane at midnight. I love the rather ambiguous ending that left something to the imagination and yet wrapped up everything all at the same time.
Columbo Moment: His preoccupation with shoes is classic.

4)Dagger of the Mind (3 Stars) - (96 min.) Because of the length it's more new ground! Sadly, the ground is a bit uneven. I love the leads; their chemistry is quite good. The change-of-pace locale adds to the sort of ""holiday"" feel from the normal LA areas still the story here is a bit uneven. Since the murder wasn't out of anger and the villains have nothing to gain it seems to sap the overall suspense of the episode and the bit with the umbrella switch seems padded and drawn out. Columbo as usual is his normal absent minded self but the best episodes always have a bit more than that going for them.
Columbo Moment: Columbo's observation that Big Ben is ""only"" a minute slow.

5)Requiem of a Falling Star (3.5 Stars) - (74 min.) Good performances, solid story, and sincere intrigue mark a memorable episode. I have viewed this episode a few times and it is still great fun and has several scenes on the Universal back lot that have plenty of double meanings. ""Lieutenant I would never type-cast you as a detective."" -the Studio Head
Columbo Moment: He gets a new tie. And it is recommended he also get a new over coat, shoes, shirt...

6)A Stitch in Crime (4.5 Stars) - (74 min.) Despite the silly name this is a great episode. As a Trekker you'd think I would be biased towards this because of Nimoy. In fact, I'm hyper critical of it because of that and I must say Leonard Nimoy is another in a series of great finds for Columbo to... find. Not quite the 5 star Shatner performance in Season 6's Fade in to Murder, but close enough. The episode seems to derail a bit in the third act regarding Harry Alexander's drugging but all in all this one has a certain charm. I especially like the Nimoy dinner party sequence.
Columbo Moment: Not sure how much of this is adlib, but the part when Columbo asks to see the murder weapon only to crack his egg on it is... priceless.

7)The Most Dangerous Match (4 stars) - (74 min.) Having viewed this once before I still say this is one of the best. The heavy in this, Laurence Harvey (as Emmett Clayton) has the intensity needed to convey the best of Columbo. The ""Tomlin Dudek"" role is a bit thin but he isn't in this very much.
Columbo Moment: The questioning at the simultaneous chess match is masterful.

8)Double Shock (4 stars) - (74 min.) Excellent, simply excellent! How do you get better than Martin Landau? You have two of them!! From start to finish this ep is amazing fun and well written. Columbo takes a hand at cooking and I for one definitely believe the roles of Landau, it truly seems like there are two of them, it's called acting, folks.
Columbo Moment: The many exchanges with Mrs. Peck, the live in house keeper, are amazing fun!

Conclusion:
Sometimes things are worth more than the sum of their parts, that's why this is a 5 star set. Season II is so worth your money and is so solid, the only truly negative thing I can say is (beyond the art work and rather steep price), you'll have to wait months for Season III, and you can burn through Season II in less than a week.",1110844800,85,6450,4.528755364806867
579517,3,630312898X,"First off, I'd like to say that I'm very impressed with the quickness of the second season release.  I hope the rest of the series is as timely. That being said, I think Universal cheaped out a bit with the second season. The first season came is superior in almost every respect:

1. better graphics

2. a presentation folder that holds all the disks

3. each disk has a photo inlay of Peter Falk

4. Coloumbo quotes peppered hear and there

5. each episode is NOT preceeded by an annoying Universal

identification short (the logo of Universal, not sure what to call that)

Season 2 is simply a presentation box sleeve and 2 cheap clam shell DVD cases inside. I was also hoping that the second season would contain maybe a little bonus material. Photo stills... something!?! I do like the little episode preview before every episode,thats something the first season collection didn't have.

Anyway, I rate the NBC Mystery Movie Columbo Series 5 STARS all the way! But, I think the set could have been a little bit better.",1110844800,5,1023,4.638888888888889
579518,5,630312898X,"I mentioned in my review for season one that the best part of watching a Columbo episode is the inter-play between Columbo and the murder suspect at hand.  Where season one saw Peter Falk still fleshing out the character of Columbo, season two makes it obvious that show has gelled and finally hit its stride.  We see the bumbling yet cunning detective become a little more congenial and a little more disheveled as.  But we wouldn't want him any other way.

This is by far one of the best seasons of Columbo ever and every episode lives up to this bold claim.  Below is a synopsis of all the episodes contained in this season two package with notes regarding production and guest stars:

Etude In Black - Originally aired Sep. 17, 1972

John Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose concert pianist lover threatens to blow the lid on their forbidden nookie.  Since his wife Janice is played by the very fetching Blythe Danner it's anyone's guess what motivates him to have the affair in the first place.  But in any event, Janice's mother just happens to be the chairman of the symphony board and he would stand to lose more than his reputation if the secret got out.

Directed by Nick Colasanto - Written by Steven Bochco

Note:  Be sure to look out for Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi of Karate Kid fame) playing the part of the house boy.  No one knows if this is where he cultivated his amazing skills at waxing on and off though.

The Greenhouse Jungle - Originally aired Oct. 15, 1972

Tony Goodland played by Bradford Dillman is in love with a no good, cheatin' kind of woman but his love for her knows no bounds.  Tony also happens to be the heir to a quite sizeable trust fund managed by his Uncle Jarvis Goodlands deftly performed by the great Ray Milland.  Always the caring Uncle, Jarvis helps his nephew devise a scheme to fake his own kidnapping in hopes of wooing his wife away from her muscle bound boyfriend and back into his arms again.  Of course sweet and loyal Uncle Jarvis decides this would be the perfect opportunity to get rid of his nephew and gain control of the money.  Everything goes as planned until Lt. Columbo first steps onto the scene.

Directed by Boris Sagal - Written by Jonathan Latimer

The Most Crucial Game - Originally aired Nov. 5, 1972

Robert Culp turns in another outstanding guest starring role as Paul Hanlon, the general manager of a sports empire which just happens to be owned by a young, clueless playboy who inherited it from his father.  Besides the horrible crime of murder, Mr. Hanlon soils the reputation of ice cream men everywhere when he poses as one to shield him from any witnesses while committing the act.  As always, Columbo finds the right `time' to nab him in the end.

Directed by Jeremy Paul Kagan - Written by John T. Dugan

Note:  Valerie Harper and Dean Stockwell (who would later appear in Quantum Leap) make memorable guest appearances.

Dagger Of The Mind - Originally aired Nov. 26, 1972

Lt. Columbo visits jolly ole' England on a detective exchange program and finds himself in the thick of a murder within the theatrical world from the get go. Richard Basehart and Honor Blackman play a husband and wife eager to regain the spotlight as their careers sink.  When the money behind the production of Macbeth they are set to star in finds out he's been tricked into supporting this venture he threatens to pull the plug and ruin them.  His days are numbered once he decides to do this and Columbo has to navigate British customs and etiquette to bring them to justice.

Directed by Richard Quine - Written by Jackson Gillis

Note:  Wilfrid Hyde-White turns in a performance almost on par with Peter Falk's.  A veteran of British stage and screen, he would later turn up as the butler in The Toy starring Richard Pryor.

Requiem For A Falling Star - Originally aired Jan. 21, 1973

Anne Baxter plays fading movie siren Nora Chandler who's getting by on bit parts on television these days.  She tries to murder her cheating husband but kills her personal assistant instead.  Always blown away by some of the famous people he meets in his line of work, Columbo never the less keeps his star struck eyes on the prize and nabs her for more than just one murder!

Directed by Richard Quine - Written by Jackson Gillis

A Stitch In Crime - Originally aired Feb. 11, 1973

When sharing the credit for a new drug that fights transplant rejection seems like too much for him, Dr. Barry Mayfield, played by Leonard Nimoy, decides to surgically remove his partner in medicine.  Will Greer (who played Grandpa Walton on The Walton's) plays his ill fated colleague and this ends up being one of the more difficult cases for Columbo to crack yet.  He even loses his trademark cool at one point highlighting just how crafty Mr. Spock can be.

Directed by Hy Averback - Written by Shirl Hendryx

Note:  Hy Averback directed many classic episodes of the T.V. series M.A.S.H.

The Most Dangerous Match - Originally aired March 4, 1973

American Grand Master in Chess Emmet Clayton played by Laurence Harvey is dogged by the assumption that he isn't actually the best since ailing Tomlin Dudek isn't around to challenge him.  A match is finally set between the two but a pre-game showdown in which Emmet loses foretells his possible embarrassment on an international stage.  Our Grand Master decides to call check mate and get rid of him before this can happen.

Directed by Edward M. Abroms - Written by Jackson Gillis

Double Shock - Originally aired March 25, 1973

Martin Landau does double duty playing twin brothers afraid that their inheritance will be jeopardized by the impending nuptials of their rich uncle.  This is because Uncle Paris's fianc played by Julie Newmar is a fitness expert whose dedication to exercise is matched only by her ability to waste money in large amounts.  Dexter and Norman decide to end this possibility by getting rid of their dear uncle.

Directed by Robert Butler - Written by Steven Bochco, Jackson Gillis, Richard Levinson and William Link

Note:  One of the brothers, Dexter, plays a cooking show host and the scenes of him and Columbo during one of his tapings is one of the most humorous scenes ever filmed in this series.

Extras:  No extras with this package to speak of except for the inclusion of pre-show promos before each episode which are pretty nifty.",1110758400,7,6359,4.65947888589398
579519,5,630312898X,"I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the second season was released so quickly after the first season (September 04).  I've been watching Colombo on VHS for years and have practically worn out the first season's DVDs (if that's possible).  The show is so well-crafted, so well-researched, so well-acted that I agree with many of the reviewers here who say it was probably the best television series ever produced in the United States.

Of the episodes in this collection, the one guest-starring Leonard Nimoy is probably my favorite.  What a privilege to watch two GREAT actors, Falk and Nimoy, spar in a riveting and suspenseful episode!

Regarding the lack of special features.  Let's keep in mind that the more features they have to put together to produce the DVD, the longer we'll have to wait for subsequent releases. I say, Keep 'em coming!  I'll do without the bonus stuff.",1110326400,3,888,4.919463087248322

There is one episode where Columbo is sitting in a hospital waiting room with the culprit, and they are both smoking! In another, he is eating a bowl of chili while holding his cigar. Who does that? It was a different time, and the Columbo series captures that.",1110240000,5,499,4.434782608695652

Ok, now down to business...  Being only 27 years old, you can imagine the looks I get when I tell people that my favorite television show is Columbo.  I could set my clock to when it's on TV.  When I saw they were going to start releasing it on DVD, a sense of calm came over me.  With Peter Falk's portrayal, there is absolutely no better TV character than Columbo.

All I can say is bring on the rest of the series...don't stop now!",1110153600,6,644,4.461538461538462

Universal will be working on adding some bonus material, a series of this caliber must have a wealth of great bonus material in the vaults and like one other reviewer mentioned Peter is still alive, Why not some interviews?  If so many of the new shows out there who now have seasons available on DVD have tons of extras features, Columbo should equally if not more also have some extras.
