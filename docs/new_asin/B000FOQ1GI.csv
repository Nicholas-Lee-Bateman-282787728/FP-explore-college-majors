2581565,4,B000FOQ1GI,i enjoyed the grandfather character very much- though such different cultures and ages have their stresses- i did think the daughter in law was awful. much of the tension was unnecessary because of her refusal to accept the grandfather in any way. the Tai Chi is amazing-,1495152000,,271,4.787234042553192

2581567,2,B000FOQ1GI,"The wife is a such a (expletive) contemptible character that she really makes the movie unwatchable.  All the other characters are very likable, but still flawed.  But the wife is terrible.  I didn't make it to the end, but I hope her husband divorced her.

Also would be better if there was more stuff about tai chi in it.  Even watching the grandfather do tai chi would have been 100 times better than any scene with the wife.",1489104000,,428,4.435897435897436

2581569,1,B000FOQ1GI,"My, oh, my!  This movie was so slow and dull and boring I almost stopped it at the 20 minute mark.  But trying to be fair, I decided to give it a chance and watch it a little more.  My mistake, it only got more slow, more dull and extremely boring all the way to the end.

2581571,1,B000FOQ1GI,This movie is so slow and goes nowhere fast. I gave up watching it after the first 30 mins. and that was too long. Why oh Why was this movie ever made and what was the point?? One star is one star too many for this movie.,1486598400,,221,3.723404255319149
2581572,3,B000FOQ1GI,"If you are an older person or an immigrant, you would like this movie.  It's about a 70 year old man who is a Tai Chi master in China, but immigrated to the United States after his son married a white woman.  The old man arrived a month earlier without any English skills, but lives in the same household as the couple and his grandson.  The wife is a writer and requires personal quiet space to concentrate, so she finds the father annoying as he's always watching Chinese rentals, sings in Chinese, do Tai Chi in the house, smokes, cooks Chinese food, etc. that's all familiar to him in his Chinese culture.  She on the other hand doesn't understand or care for it, and would like to either move to a bigger house to have her own space or have to move out.  Her husband loves his father and his wife, but doesn't know how to accommodate to both.  One day his father stepped out and the son went mad and decided it was time his father moves to a nursing home, but before he could say anything, the father figured out that he doesn't fit in and is disrupting the happiness of his son and decides to move out.  However, during the time that he lived with his son, he also met a wonderful Chinese senior citizen who works at his volunteer job that he has been able to get along with and enjoys spending time with her.  Now that he's moving out, he will have to leave her behind.  The story is pretty much about immigration hardship, the generation gap and difficulties of relationships.  A bit slow, but a nice reminder of how complicated life is in America.",1486598400,4,1556,4.334482758620689
2581573,4,B000FOQ1GI,"Powerful film, well acted. The story of a Chinese immigrant coping in America. Enjoyable. 4 Stars.",1486166400,,98,5.1875
2581574,4,B000FOQ1GI,The movie is dated but i really like the story line of this Tai chi master aging in another country and problems that arise. His daughter-in-law is a bit more whacked than should be but still a nice story.,1485820800,,205,4.282051282051282
2581575,5,B000FOQ1GI,I like movies on family in addition to all the other genres you make available. The subtitles did not detract from the movie for me because I was in Taiwan for some time during my Army career.,1485734400,,192,4.216216216216216
2581576,1,B000FOQ1GI,"Boring. Uninteresting. The movie does not have good story line. After trying to watch the movie thrice, during which it sent me to sleep (which is usual) I was still wondering what the purpose of the movie was.",1485475200,,210,4.552631578947368
2581577,4,B000FOQ1GI,"This was Ang Lee's first feature film, released in 1992. It is the story of an old T'ai Chi master whose son brings him to America from China, and the old man finds the adjustment very difficult.
I was drawn to this film by the title. Pushing Hands is a two-person form of T'ai Chi which is taught by my sifu and practiced by advanced students at the school that I attend.
There is a scene in the film in which the T'ai Chi Master dares his adversaries to move him just one half-step. Five or six gang up on him; they cannot budge him.
The average viewer might think that this is b.s. How can a man in his 70's hold his ground against 6 men half his age or younger? I will tell you that I KNOW that it can be done.
Alas, I myself cannot do it...yet. ;-)
Good movie with messages of sensitivity and respect for one's elders.",1484956800,4,823,4.08641975308642

It described the relationship between a a father and a son which the son is completely americanized, and there is not an once of American in the father. So... Not only you have generational difference you also have culture difference.

Watch it more than once.",1482624000,4,493,4.72093023255814

2581599,3,B000FOQ1GI,Pretty good story. I'm a huge fan of Chow Young Fat so it was nice to see his directorial talents behind the camera. I give it three stars as there were some gaps in the plot as well as surrrealism in the old man's ability but still a worthy movie to watch on if you have some time to kill. Also keep in mind the year this movie was released.,1482019200,,342,3.9

2581602,4,B000FOQ1GI,"the pace is rather slow but you do get emotionally invested with the casteam most especially with the Tai Chi grandmaster. This tale of a Chinese immigrant resetting his life by relocating to the states to live with his only son and his new American family, deceptively shows the struggle to find a balance between his old way of life and this new American way of life.  the fact that he's a Tai Chi grandmaster in an art form that deals very much with balance of mind body a d spirit, is the precise juxtaposition that's makes this film so enjoyable to watch. the ending though simple casts an elegant end to the beginning in some very simple words between the main protagonist and his apparent new luv interest.",1481932800,,713,4.5271317829457365

2581623,4,B000FOQ1GI,"And Lee's first western movie is not typical of his later pyrotechnic acrobatic fantasy films but an analysis of and elderly Chinese man who is a Tai Chi Master and his difficulty in both dealing with Western culture and the isolation felt after being forced to leave China when communists took power. I love Tai Chi so just from this perspective it was very enjoyable. I like the oddball characters and the tender way the director presented Chinese stereotypes.

2581670,4,B000FOQ1GI,"When the movie started I thought it was going to be very dull.  The woman was so unappealing and unattractive.  But I ended up really liking the movie.  It tells the story of a Chinese father moving from CHina to live with his son, his wife, and their young son in America.  It is a touching portrayal of the difficulty of adjusting to a different culture and language.  Delightful.",1477180800,4,382,4.478260869565218

2581674,4,B000FOQ1GI,"A sensitive story involving a 70-year old man from Beijing who, after retirement, moves to live with his son, his son's American wife, and his grandson, in New York. The grandfather is a Tai Chi master, and teaches a class at the local Chinese center where he befriends a widow. But right from the start, conflicts develop between the grandfather and his American daughter-in-law, a novelist, which intensify with time. The resolution of  these conflicts becomes the central preoccupation of the remainder of the movie. The acting, particularly by the grandfather, is very good. And so is the seeming authenticity of the atmosphere created by these characters. There is a certain exaggeration of the old man's Kung Fu powers which borders on the fantastic (a 6 to 1 win,) but it suits well the movie's purposes. 4 1/2 stars",1475971200,10,823,4.920863309352518

8125298,3,B000FOQ1GI,"3 1/2 Stars.  I wouldn't call this slow-moving, or quiet, or boring.  The only word that comes to mind is episodic.  Ang Lee is a favorite director- I loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wedding-Banquet/dp/B00950UKK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wedding Banquet</a>&nbsp;and every other one of his films.  This one, an early one, although it was okay, not quite as much.  I've seen it twice now (enjoyed it more the second time).  It doesn't strike me as profound, but I liked all the characters, they seemed very real, especially the grown son.  I wonder if the fault is mine, if the film resonates with Chinese sensibilities that I'm just not in tune with.

While I often appreciate subtle films, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B001DUDKEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sea-of-Trees/dp/B01KH1J23M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sea of Trees</a>, I think I would have liked Pushing Hands more if it had had more of a slam-dunk ending- it's casual, very matter-of-fact.  In terms of acculturation and adapting to a new culture, it reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inch-Allah-Dimanche-Sunday-God-Willing/dp/B00WJNDSO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inch'Allah Dimanche (Sunday, God Willing)</a>&nbsp;which I loved- it DID have more of a slam-dunk ending (reminiscent of The Graduate, it made me want to cheer).  I do think Pushing Hands is interesting and worth watching- as you can see by reviews, many people loved it- perhaps you will too.",1516665600,,1707,7.163461538461538
8125299,4,B000FOQ1GI,"If you are not into drama, or tai chi, skip this. I like because being an occidental I admire the old wisdom and this movie has the right balance. Meehh what do i know ? Watch for yourself on a calm and lonely day.",1515974400,,214,3.8863636363636362

8125303,5,B000FOQ1GI,"If you have watched Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (by Ang Lee) and loved it, if you have interest in Chinese culture then watch this. This movie is by the same director and is one of his early creations. The movie is about a Tai Chi master from mainland China that moves in with his son, American daughter-in-law and the grandson. There is culture clash between the 70-year old and the daughter-in-law and the son gets crushed in the middle. Not your stereo-typical kung fu movie from Hong Kong - Ang Lee does not make those. Watch it through the end. A subsequent movie by the same director and lead actor is also highly recommended - ""Eat Drink Man Woman"".",1503619200,,658,4.53781512605042
