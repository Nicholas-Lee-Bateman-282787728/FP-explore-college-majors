1375373,5,B00004YKSN,"Any opportunity to see rare film of the owner of the greatest voice ever to find its way to a human throat is not to be missed. Mario Lanza was without equal in his day, and such remains the case at present. Many of the more candid operatic stars of today admit to Lanza as having served as their inspiration. The world lost far too soon the greatest gift ever presented to the concert stage. Occasionally, there comes along a voice remarkable for its sheer beauty; another may gain fame as the possessor of phenomenal power and size, while another may become known for astonishing range. How breathtaking it truly is when ALL these qualities, and more, come together in a single voice. Mario Lanza. As good as it gets. As good as it CAN get.",1260835200,29,742,4.463235294117647

1375376,5,B00004YKSN,"Another great Mario Lanza movie.  Great comic talent, great enthusiam (it seems to flow so effortlessly from him), and, of course that great voice.  Once again, Kathryn Grayson is wonderful as his leading lady--what a lovely voice.  His comic sidekick is excellent.",1128816000,,265,5.261904761904762
1375377,5,B00004YKSN,"Mario Lanza gave over 150 concerts in his brief career; tragically, only a tiny fraction of these were preserved on tape, and even fewer performances were captured on film. This videotape contains two out of the three live performances known to be in existence. Missing here is the tenor's 1957 appearance at the London Palladium; it's to be hoped that the Belcanto Society releases that exciting event in the near future.
The present video contains Lanza's 1954 appearance on the Chrysler-sponsored Shower of Stars Show, and a 1957 interview in Rome. In total he sings five items: E Lucevan Le Stelle from ""Tosca"", Some Day from ""The Vagabond King"", Santa Lucia, Because You're Mine, and Schubert's Ave Maria.
The Chrysler Show is exciting, all the more for the fact that Lanza had made headlines the previous month when he lip-synched on the same show. Here he is extremely tentative as he steps out on stage (knowing that this is ""make or break time""), but when the first magical notes pour forth all is forgiven. Lanza gives a thrilling rendition of the Tosca aria, and a beautifully phrased Some Day, quelling all speculation that his voice was failing.
The Rome interview, filmed at the Vatican with one Father Keller from the The Christophers charitable institution, is fascinating. Unlike the earlier show, Lanza looks great, showing none of the fatigue and excess weight that one associates with his appearance in Seven Hills of Rome, filmed the same year. He proves to be a charismatic and entertaining speaker (though one should take some of his Altar Boy assertions with a large grain of salt) and his singing is extremely enjoyable. He is in rich voice with plenty of bloom and verve. Again, it is a real pity that the London Palladium show of the following month was not included, if only for sheer contrast. (That performance includes standout renditions of, once again, Because You're Mine and E Lucevan Le Stelle.)
The picture quality is acceptable (only just in the case of the Chrsyler Show), but one should make allowances given the historical importance of these performances. The sound varies from item to item. Ave Maria suffers from a ""gurgle"", but Because You're Mine has a much cleaner quality. There is some compression on the Chrysler Show, and Lanza's voice is pushed back a little. None of these faults, however, need detract from your enjoyment of a phenomenal talent.",999475200,25,2399,4.925925925925926
1375397,5,B00004YKSN,"Mario Lanza was a ""peoples"" Opera singer. He related to normal people in a way no other ""opera quality"" singer ever did. He sang many songs in English to we could hear the quality of his voice and understand what he was singing about. His heart/emotions shown through on so many of his music....... it made his talent available to non-opera type people........... His voice still gives me chills. No other Tenor has done what he did. Humanized opera quality singing.",1403481600,2,466,4.765432098765432
1375398,1,B00004YKSN,This DVD was a total gip. It was little comedy bits like in the I Love Lucy show. Corny. With a little bit of singing. Overpriced.,1399161600,,130,4.038461538461538
1375399,1,B00004YKSN,this is awful. the sound is bad and the picture quality is terrible too. I watched it once and threw it away,1396224000,,108,3.9545454545454546
1375400,5,B00004YKSN,While the film is bad the time listening to Mr. Lanza is wonderful. It was a worthwhile purchase which I will keep listening to.,1395705600,,128,4.375
1375401,4,B00004YKSN,I've always been a fan of Mario Lanza and this CD gives a personal touch to him and his life.  I agree with other reviewers that they have captured some of his best performances in relaxed circumstances.  If you are interested in some of Mario Lanza's most well known songs then the four stars is perhaps too many.  I found this CD very pleasing.,1388016000,4,346,4.375
1375402,2,B00004YKSN,The video was not clear since it had not been reformatted. or whatever the word is to make an old video easy to view.  Other than that the video was interesting.,1386720000,,161,4.193548387096774

Documentaries about Mario Lanza have been made that are better than this, yet this film is useful and made for fans like me.

Mario Lanza was the most versatile tenor who ever walked on a stage. He could sing opera like the greatest tenors of all time. He was a master at ""crossing over"" from lyric opera to popular singing. As a result, he was a top recording artist and concert performer. In the ""Great Caruso"" he also showed he could be a global movie sensation. The movie about the amazing Neapolitan tenor actually was about Mario Lanza. It turned the Great Caruso into the Great Lanza. He exhibited all of his splendid qualities.

The movie inspired me to write my recent book about Mario Lanza: ""A Kid from Philadelphia, Mario Lanza, the Voice of the Poets."" It is not a biography. There have been several excellent bios about him. This is a book from a fan. It exhibits his qualities, talents, passion and love for his art. I wanted it to be a ""page turner"" that would be impossible to put down while listening to the magnificent voice of Mario Lanza.

Anyone who loves Lanza the movie star, the tenor, the popular singer and the human being who did so much in such a short time will like this film.",1381536000,6,1444,5.131914893617021

This might not be enjoyed by today's audiences unless they're Lanza fans like I am, because the picture is b&w & is a little blurry, unlike we are used to in these HD days.  I enjoyed parts of the TV sketches [especially Betty Grable!] but it was Lanza I was looking for & Lanza I got!  There's some opera & some ""regular"" [i.e., my way of saying ""not opera""].  My favorite operatic aria was ""E lucevan le stelle"" [WOW!]; favorite non-operatic song is the famous ""Be My Love.""",1465603200,,605,4.532110091743119
