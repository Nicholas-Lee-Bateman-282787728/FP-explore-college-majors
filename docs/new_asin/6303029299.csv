540397,2,6303029299,"The movie itself is great. I saw it a long time ago on VHS. I was hoping that this just released DVD would give me a high quality version of my old VHS tape and was very disappointed. For one, it is only in English, there is no choice of selecting the original language. The quality is not any better than the VHS tape I have had for over 15 years. To be fair, nowhere did the product description state that it had been digitally remastered or that the original language was available, however, in this day and time, one expects that of just released DVD's, even if the product description does not mention it.
That being said, the movie itself is still great, loved it, very funny.",1242086400,16,682,4.3359375
540398,5,6303029299,"Here's an offbeat movie that is clever and funny. A happily married man (so he thinks), played by Heiner Lauterbach, is about to celebrate his 12th wedding anniversary when he discovers his wife (Ulrike Kriener) is having an affair with an artist (Uwe Ochsenknecht). He decides to get revenge by moving in with Uwe and attempting to change him into someone just like himself. It works and his wife comes back to him. The movie looks at gender roles in an upside-down, clever way that is both insightful and very humorous. It's a wonderful little farce. Shot on a shoestring, it was a mild hit when it first came out. Definitely worth a watch.",1148083200,3,642,4.640350877192983
540399,4,6303029299,Doris Dorrie is a really great film maker and writer.  Her movies always have a rebellious and non-conformist nature to them.  Her comedic strategies are stubtle and witty and always with a purpose.  Her film Manner (Men) is great because it's honest and its just a story about finding yourself and opening your mind to life's situations.,1098835200,,338,4.894736842105263
540400,5,6303029299,"This is clearly Doris Doerrie's best effort. ""Men"" (Maenner in German) is a great, funny, yet sensitive satire and a tongue-in-cheek look at many 80's stereotypes. Julius Armbrust (brilliantly played by Heiner Lauterbach) is the stereotypical successful executive: art director at an advertising firm, nice house, beautiful wife, nice kids, Maserati in the garage and an affair with the secretary. On his wedding anniversary (which he almost forgets) he finds out his wife has an affair and his world unhinges. He leaves the house and starts spying on the wife. Her new guy is a free-spirited artist who lives in an off-beat shared apartment. When he kicks one of his roomies out, Julius moves in with him, and it only gets better from there....how will they fare as room-mates and who will Julius' wife Paula choose in the end? Just watch it, this movie is great!",1078185600,8,864,4.924657534246576
540401,2,6303029299,"Contrary to what others have expressed, I found Men to be slow moving and rather dull, with the dialogue tending to be forced and overly random.  While admirable performances by Uwe Ochsenknecht and Heiner Lauterbach save this flick from a 1-star, I must say that this Komdie lives up to the stereotypical opinion of German comedy...where's comedy?",1038873600,,348,5.105263157894737
540402,5,6303029299,"I also caught this on the Independant Film Channel in Seattle.  I was fortunate enough find and to rent it and surprise my German boyfriend when he came to visit me from the east coast to Seattle.  He was so surprised,  it was one of his favorite films!  Honest and funny, characters actually  have an on-screen raport and are believable and true to life.  None of the  fake Hollywood stuff here.  You'll love it!",950745600,7,413,4.486486486486487
540403,4,6303029299,"I caught this movie on the Independent Film channel and was thoroughly delighted.  With the disclaimer that I am not terribly experienced with foreign films, I loved the feel of the movie:  it was clearly not from  Hollywood!  The movie has some serious themes but the many laughs bring it  to a level that has a wide appeal.  I would definitely recommend  ""Men"" to anyone who is wanting to experience something outside of  typical Hollywood fare; this movie will satisfy that craving without going  over your head.",917740800,3,515,4.827586206896552
7835422,4,6303029299,"This is a review of the movie. I managed to see a version which was ok, not great, but  better than the one sold here. I doubt, short of Criterion's making a new one, that a really good copy of this is available. I really liked this film when it was released back in 1985. Also, it is a German comedy. Germany does not make many comedies so it was worth re-seeing for that aspect too. How does it hold up?

It's still good but it now does seem somewhat dated. It is very hard to put my finger on what is dated about it. The plot is pretty simple: a married man moves in as the roommate of the single artist who is having an affair with his wife. They eventually become friends. In fact, the wife seems superfluous by the end of the film.

It may be that we have, between 1985 and now, been making better and better films about male to male interaction. So this film does not seem as fresh as it did in 1985. I am surprised someone has not made a remake of this comedy with more going on in the present day version. I think it is ripe for a remake, foreign or domestic.

It is weird to see no one with a computer, tablet or smartphone anywhere. In fact, we open on secretaries typing on typewriters.",1520467200,,1198,4.085106382978723
7835423,1,6303029299,"Unfortunately, I did not watch this within the return window.  DVD was obviously copied from a VHS (you can see the tracking noise), blurry, dubbed, piece of garbage, which is where it is going.  I will avoid this seller in the future.",1485216000,2,235,4.571428571428571
7835424,1,6303029299,"Horrible.  Threw it away.  It's English voice-overs with nothing in German and no menu-choice to change that.  The film is worse than junk made by first year film students.  If you're unhappy in life, perhaps woman-hating and don't like your kids, maybe you'll like it.",1458172800,2,269,4.911111111111111
7835425,1,6303029299,"I have been looking for this film for a long time.  I was very disappointed to find that this was a dubbed version with no option for subtitles.  I NEVER watch dubbed movies.  The ad did not mention this.  It was also a horrible copy.  It looked like it had been taped secretly from a screen, then transferred to an aging VCR then put on disc by a machine that cost $20.00.  That said, I would encourage anyone who is able to find a subtitled copy that is good enough to be viewable should check this excellent film.  Presented properly it is one of the funniest movies I have ever watched.",1427673600,3,590,4.261261261261262
7835426,2,6303029299,"I heard a lot about this film and since I'm fluent in German was excited to finally see it.
Disappointed it was dubbed in English. Also, the quality was terrible. This is a clever and witty film. It was still enjoyable to watch yet can't wait until its digitally re-mastered and in the original German.",1376956800,2,302,4.509090909090909
7835427,1,6303029299,"I bought this DVD, because I saw the movie in my German class 13 years ago as a freshman in college and I thought it was a really hilarious. Also, I liked Doris Drrie's other movie ""Me and Him"" where Griffin Dunne's penis starts talking to him (penis voiced by Mark-Linn Baker from 'Perfect Strangers'). When I ordered this DVD, I was so excited, but I started watching a few minutes of it and I was so turned off when I saw that the picture quality was poor. As if that is not enough, the movie was dubbed in English. That defeats the whole purpose of watching a foreign movie in my book, irregardless of whether or not I know the language, ecause you miss out on the original tones and expressions.",1371772800,2,700,4.3106060606060606
7835428,1,6303029299,"I returned this DVD, by importcds - this is not a commercially made product by DVD quality standards, but home made, and poor at that - I can do a better VHS transfer at home. But the film is wonderful.",1361923200,,202,4.075
7835429,1,6303029299,"From one of the customer reviews (and the lack of product info), I had anticipated this to be the older German DVD with English subtitles. It turns out to be a badly dubbed English version, where the video quality is equally bad. It seems like an unauthorized copy of the VHS version of the film. Disappointing! I do hope that the DVD (German/English subtitles) will be re-released soon. It just came out again in German (and German and French) on the Continent, so perhaps the U.S. will follow suit soon. I need both languages for my film courses at college.",1350259200,2,559,4.6

7835431,1,6303029299,"Very bad quality DVD; Labels on CD and Package appear to be ""home made""; Returned product to Seller (""importcds"") and so far, did not hear from them nor was I reimbursed (nearly 2 months after product arrived returned at their facility).

Regret that this otherwise positively ranked seller does not step up to the issue.  The following note went to the seller.

Dear Import CDs:
I returned above mention DVD and still have not received the credit of ""$15.60"" to my credit card.
I ordered via Amazon the DVD ""MEN"" as indicated in above order number. The DVD turned out to be a cheap bootleg, possibly taped directly from TV or VHS (judging from the picture quality) and voice synchronized by amateurs. I expected an original DVD.
