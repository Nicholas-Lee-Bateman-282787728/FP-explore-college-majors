7915945,4,B00002NDKL,"This is an interesting biography of eccentric racing demon Sir Henry ""Tim"" Birkin whose racing victories in the 1920's and 30's are still legendry. Rather than leaning on a whole life biography, the film allows Rowan Atkinson (as Birkin)to explain the things that were most important to him, racing itself and his rivalry and friendship with the ""Bentley Boys"". It includes some great vintage and faux vintage footage. The best part of this short classic program is the exceptional acting. Rowan Atkinson shines. Geoffrey Palmer's short role as Birkin's father is excellent.""Ghost writer"" Crispen Bonham-Carter is extremely believable and Ken Kitson(as Birkin's right hand man)shows off his superb supporting skills. My one criticism is that they tried to cram too much into one hour. This should have been extended into it's own mini series for depth.",996105600,11,852,5.272058823529412
