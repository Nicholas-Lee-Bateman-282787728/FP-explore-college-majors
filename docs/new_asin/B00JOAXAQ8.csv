8652594,5,B00JOAXAQ8,"Probably one of the best series of late. The 1960s detail is done very well. Plots and a certain style predominate and as in the tradition of Inspector Morse, Music permeates these dramas. In one, Opera is the key, and the continued ""one word"" titles feature some really interesting filming and personal exchanges that are believable. It is incredible, but this has been a successful transition to go backward in time showing Morse as he was in his rookie years.",1469404800,,462,4.7875
