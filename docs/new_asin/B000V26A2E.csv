Not a bad video. Cuing is fine. Just not what I was expecting.",1339286400,,233,4.4186046511627906
8216306,3,B000V26A2E,The info on site gave the impression that there were two bands with the DVD but this wasn't the case and I had to spend $44 to buy them in a sports shop. The one hour session is pleasant and astutely judged to suit all levels. Steffanie is accompanied by her sister who is less sporty and a lissom young person who does everything at a higher level. Pick which one you follow. I did not like the music but it falls short of being outright annoying. Once you've learned the routine you can turn the sound down. Put your own stuff on. The tag line claims that you're getting twice the effect in half the time so I was hoping for a half hour routine to replace my one hour Pilates one but there is no time saving. I recommend it as a daily routine that is graceful and interesting but I do think the words are misleading.,1287619200,,818,4.150943396226415
8216307,5,B000V26A2E,"I'm not a flexible person, but this looked like a good way into resistance band workout.

It uses gentle, flowing moves and I was able to go at my own pace, varying the resistance by moving my hands on the band. I definitely was stretching and using muscles that I ordinarily don't. And after only a few sessions am noticing improvement in flexibility. I am not as tight as I was before.

The video looks very gentle, but I find myself winded by the end.

I'd recommend this for any beginner. Just remember to keep a towel under your head or rear end as you do.",1277164800,4,561,4.273584905660377
8216308,5,B000V26A2E,"A friend recommended this workout video and I was a little hesitant at first as a man following women thinking it would not be enough for me, but I was WRONG!!! I was looking for a cardio routine that would increase my flexibility and this program does the trick using the bands. After just a week and a half I notice an increase in movement in my arms, shoulders and legs. I am really pleased with using the program in such a short period of time, and would recommend it.",1198281600,12,472,4.2555555555555555
