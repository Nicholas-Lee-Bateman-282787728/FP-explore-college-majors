3043072,4,B000ZN71M2,"hey i liked it. it really made sense to me. i thought it was both funny and romantic. but i also understand why people don't like it, so do i recommend it? sure, but don't expect logic.",1370649600,2,185,4.027027027027027
3043073,5,B000ZN71M2,"Crazy film, when i started it I didn't know where it would take me. But this movie is a trip. I would recommend it.",1353715200,2,115,3.8333333333333335
3043074,1,B000ZN71M2,This movie is horrible.  I sat through it until the end figuring it had to get better but it only got worse.  Alexander Skarsgard's good looks are hidden by his cross-dressing so there is nothing to redeem this fiasco.  The interviews with the people involved in the project were funny as Bjorn couldn't even tell us what it was about.  Don't waste your time on this one.,1334966400,,371,4.492537313432836
3043075,4,B000ZN71M2,"If you like Alexander Skarsgard, and can get past seeing him act like a womman, this is the movie for you. He does an excellent job. The movie is funny and entertaining.",1314230400,2,169,4.3125
3043076,2,B000ZN71M2,"Alex Skarsgard was the only reason why I purchased this movie. I was dissapointed at the end. There is not central theme to this ridiculous movie. It is one giant disaster. Julie is cool, but does much better acting in Dexter.",1273881600,3,226,4.536585365853658
3043077,5,B000ZN71M2,I love this movie because it is funny. It also has a great cast including one of my favorite Swedish actors and the storyline is so off the wall that it is really funny movie. It is one of my favorites.,1267920000,2,202,3.951219512195122
3043078,1,B000ZN71M2,"In the space between True Blood seasons we thought this might be a fun diversion, but it's not. This movie is hardly watchable. Alex in a dress is amusing, but not worth watching the whole of this disaster.",1267488000,,206,4.447368421052632
3043079,4,B000ZN71M2,"I just love Alexander Skarsgard. So he was 100 % the reason that I bought this DVD. And I thought he was wonderful in his part as the depressed transvestite. So for his contribution only I am so glad that I got this movie. I will admit that the overall plot was a little strange and often somewhat hard to follow. But in general, I did like the quirky performances. It certainly was like no other movie I have ever seen.",1233619200,23,420,4.197530864197531
3043080,2,B000ZN71M2,"The ""plot"": A young Swedish screenwriter has writer's block, until a crazy woman (portrayed by Lolita Davidovich) takes him on a thoroughly insane road trip, giving him material about which to write. In a parallel plot, a group of psych patients, including a 6'6"" transvestite, are being transported to Las Vegas by a hitman/chauffeur to participate in their therapist's (portrayed by John Larroquette) highly publicized book release and reality TV program.

Parts of this strange offering were mildly amusing. Lolita essentially steals the show with her off-the-wall characterization of a lunatic who is trying to help the young Swedish author. Some of the situations are somewhat clever and amusing in their utter absurdity. However, taken as a whole, this is a complete mess. It just doesn't make much sense, and making the matter even worse, the real author of this screenplay claims that it is all true and actually happened to him. To insult an audience with a ridiculous, disjointed plot is one thing, but to then claim that it is all true simply strains credibility beyond tolerable limits.

Several things are obvious by the ""Making of..."" special featurette: the actual writer/director (Bjorne Larson) has unlimited ego and gall. Such attributes would be invaluable in getting funding for such a disjointed project and then talking some well-known actors (including those above as well as Julie Benz, Greg German, etc.) into participation. Watch this featurette very carefully and you will get some valuable insights into how this mess became reality. Observe John Larroquette and see if you can't detect a lot of regret in ever signing on in the first place. Of particular interest is the part in which the interviewer asks all the major players individually, ""What is this movie about?""....and none can answer the question. To be honest, the ""Making of...."" featurette is probably the best part of the entire DVD, but still not worth the price of rent or purchase.

In conclusion, I watched this movie from start to finish and if I had it to do over, I would not invest the time and expense to do so. Please take this warning to heart. There are far better movies currently available and far better ways to spend your time and money.",1223856000,9,2245,4.997326203208556

8236085,4,B000ZN71M2,Good movie. Maybe not for everyone but I liked it. It's a little edgy. Best actor in it was Alexander Skarsgard. It kept my attention through the entire movie.,1495497600,,159,4.517241379310345

8236087,5,B000ZN71M2,...where high jinx ensue. Alexander Skarsgard playing the transvestite Geert was another chink in his awesome acting belt.,1474329600,,122,5.833333333333333

8236089,1,B000ZN71M2,This was not the movie that was on the trailer. Rip off!,1447632000,,56,3.75
8236090,5,B000ZN71M2,"It was a kind of funny movie, not what i expected at of Alexander Skarsguard, but I know this is one of his older flims. I would recomend the movie for a one that just want to see something different. He just looked kind of hilarious being 6'4 woman LOL!",1445644800,2,254,4.1
8236091,4,B000ZN71M2,"I hate when they make movies with the same titles, I was actually trying to order the movie of the same title with Daniel Radcliffe and was thoroughly confused when I realized it wasn't the movie I wanted. Never the less, it was my mistake and no one else's, and I did enjoy it even though it was somewhat odd. I probably won't be keeping it as it wasn't really to my taste, but I can see why some people liked it and others didn't. It's a hit or miss for the most part and depends on the person.",1428019200,,496,4.02020202020202
8236092,1,B000ZN71M2,"My wife and I couldn't even finish this movie it was so bad! And I like the stars in it. At least it told me that I myself could make a movie with no idea on how to do it to make it watchable. Near the top of the list of movies that we thought were awful, maybe the number one worst movie.",1414886400,,289,3.6031746031746033

8236094,3,B000ZN71M2,"It must be a California thing.  Who goes on a road trip to see their therapist?  You have to totally suspend any reality for this film.  It is just way out there.  I have to believe mush artistic license had to be taken with the ""True Story"" this is based on.  Anybody with a brain would've called the cops.  As such, it is worth is for 2 reasons; John Laroquette and Alexander Skarsgard's performances. I think they should have never said it was a ""True Story"", wackier fiction plots have done well.",1387152000,,500,4.380434782608695
