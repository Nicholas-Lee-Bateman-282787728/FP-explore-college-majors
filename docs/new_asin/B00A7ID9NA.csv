5392420,5,B00A7ID9NA,"World poverty and hunger together make an issue that affects millions of people across the globe, but still remains a situation that many North Americans know nothing about. Making this epidemic clear to a new audience while still maintaining high appeal is a difficult balance, but one that The Fourth World does without question.  No one watching this can remain unaffected by the realization of families suffering around the world, and at the same time will not feel as though the film was heavy-handed in doing so.  The information is fresh, the editing is excellent, the images are unforgettable, and the personal stories of desperate people are life-changing.  In short, the documentary is both real and relatable.

There are not many videos I would recommend as ones people ""should"" watch, but The Fourth World is definitely on that ""should"" list -- everyone should watch this.  A hidden global problem won't seem so hidden.",1398384000,3,931,5.0588235294117645
5392421,5,B00A7ID9NA,"I own The Fourth World, and have watched it a few times. It is such an eye-opener! It tells the very personal stories of individuals living in slums around the world to give us a better understanding of what life is like in the slums. It has a very colorful, engaging style that never gets slow or boring. It really makes clear the absolutely ridiculous scope of the problem of slums across the whole world - and because of that I think it is a must-see for anyone living in a developed country, in the comfort of a home they live in legally and with rightful claim.",1398384000,3,566,4.299065420560748
5392422,2,B00A7ID9NA,"I bought this documentary thinking that it is an in-depth exploration of squatter settlements and its complexities in the global south. But the video is just a superficial exploration of a complex subject, a complete let down. Certainly not worth the money, I wish I could return for a refund.",1385164800,2,293,4.88

8547884,4,B00A7ID9NA,I loved this film.  It was full of incredible facts and illustrations of the immense and troubling reality of extreme poverty.  You might feel yourself moved to tears from the unbelievable stories of some of the individuals in this movie.,1399852800,,238,4.925
8547885,5,B00A7ID9NA,"The Fourth World is a poignant portrayal of life in some of the largest slums in Kenya, Guatemala, and the Philippines.  The video presents powerfully disturbing statistics about the growth of these slums as well as the tragic conditions endured by 1 billion people living in slums across the globe.

But what sets this documentary apart is its presentation of real people.  Getting a glimpse into the lives of John and Felix in Kenya, Tania and Salma in Guatemala, and Jovelyn in the Philippines is both eyeopening and heartbreaking.  Anyone concerned about social justice and the healing of our world will find the video well worth the viewing.",1398816000,,646,4.953703703703703
8547886,5,B00A7ID9NA,"Before watching this film I was aware of the existence of slums. I knew that living in a slum meant poor quality of life, beyond that, I was quite naive. Though The Fourth World was less than an hour, I found it quite astonishing how much content was fit into that time, the stories and day-to-day lives you get a look into. The stories of the three slum dwellers that you will get to meet will leave you feeling helpless, and wanting to do more. This film will cause you to think beyond our first world problems, and force you to look into how a huge number of people, not too far away, are living. I was left a bit angry, wondering why we as a nation, as communities, as individuals aren't doing more for these people, which I suspect is what this film was made to do.",1398556800,,770,4.20945945945946
8547887,5,B00A7ID9NA,"The Fourth World is a courageous film that portrays an honest picture of devastating poverty with a view to bare not only the brokenness of our world, but also to expose the beauty of those buried in its refuse.  A glimmer of grace and love found in the darkest places, regardless of abject hopelessness.  It is an open reminder that we, as occupants of the earth, reside here not in isolation, but with other people that my/our world has somehow relegated out of its social consciousness.  I recommend this film to anyone seeking a global understanding of how our species disregards each other.  As a further note, take time to observe the work in putting this project together, the lighting, the sounds, the movement, the story and sensitive portrayal is a testament to the writer and director.  Very few have taken the resolve to enter this realm and then pull this off with such sincerity. Thank You.",1398556800,,904,4.732484076433121
8547888,5,B00A7ID9NA,"Wow. This film revealed a level of poverty that I had no clue existed. Stunningly captured and sensitively recounted, ""The Fourth World"" follows the stories of some of the most impoverished individuals on the planet. It presents a sad and shocking reality that leaves viewers thinking, ""What can I do to help these people?"" A movie that families can watch, and respond to, together.",1398470400,,382,4.984375
8547889,5,B00A7ID9NA,This film allows the viewer to get an in-depth look at what life is like for the poorest of the poor. It shows personal stories that lets you connect with the individual instead of seeing them as a statistic. It really makes you re-think the way that you live your own life. Definitely worth the time.,1398470400,,301,4.392857142857143
8547890,5,B00A7ID9NA,"This film gave me a new perspective on what really is going on in the world. The shots and amount of footage is fantastic and it is interesting to watch. I love that it doesn't overbear you with the facts and statistics.

I highly recommend this film to those who really want to do something about those in poverty.",1398384000,,315,4.338983050847458
8547891,5,B00A7ID9NA,"Trying to picture 1 billion people is a near-impossible task. This documentary puts faces to that number and gives a fantastic inside look at the way so many people in our modern world live. I've watched this film a dozen times, I get something new out of it every time I watch it. Definitely a film that EVERYONE should see.",1398384000,,325,4.433333333333334
8547892,5,B00A7ID9NA,"This documentary is an in depth look at the global problem of slums and brings it down to a personal level.  We experience the slums and poverty through the eyes of the people who live there.  They are not just statistics, but human beings with goals and dreams just like me.  This documentary is quite an eye opener and people need to watch it.",1398384000,4,345,4.359375
