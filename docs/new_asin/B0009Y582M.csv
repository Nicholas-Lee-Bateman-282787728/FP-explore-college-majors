While Ed Wood movies have a certain degree of charm, at least after you have watched the Johnny Depp movie, this one is so cheesy, it could come right out of Frau Antjes Gouda Factory. The ""emperor of rome"" looks like the king of chefs with a golden baker hat. The chief villain looks like he is the gay Chippendale from the Dukes Of Hazards with an extremely short Daisy Dukes in black and a collar that would fit Count Dracula.

The dialogs are so wooden, you could make about two of Noah's Arcs from them, the character development is non existing (Lou Ferigno fights a strong guy, then says without motivation:""Wait, we need you, join our party there's a village with women, children and old people in danger"" - ""If old people and children are in danger, you can count on me!"" - No questions like ""How much do I get paid, Where is it, How far is it, How many are we up against, Who is with us, Are the women pretty and willing"" - nothing).

The occasional ""classical dance shot"" of scantily clad pristesses or so looks like the actresses had some electric eel stuffed in their pants, and about as unerotic as spastic seizures. And once thing that needs explanation is why those people stumble through roman ruins all the time that look like they are 2000 years old when, presumably in ancient Rome, where the film is set, they were like new. Lots of intellectual challenges.

In the long line of remakes of ""Seven Samurai"" this got to be the worst one. On the plus side, Lou Ferigno isn't green here.

It is so cheesy, one has to watch it, but be sure to be drunk when you do. I gave two stars, one for Sibyl Danning in a skimpy leather costume. Alas, there could be more shots of her in the flic.",1364860800,,1813,4.261627906976744
8070146,4,B0009Y582M,"This movie used to play on HBO back in the mid 80's. It was one of the many low-budget Italian ""sword and sandals"" films that started popping up after the success of "" Conan the Barbarian "". ""The Seven Magnificent Gladiators"" was directed by Bruno Mattei, whose credits include cheez classics like "" Rats-Night of Terror "", "" Hell of the Living Dead "",and "" SS Extermination Love Camp "".
The cast is lead by Lou Ferrigno, Brad Davis, and Sybil Danning,  quite good for a Gladiator film. Aside from that, there's inane dialogue,some pretty bad acting, and Sybil Danning's Gladiator outfit !
I would like to see a Blu-Ray version of this, how about it Anchor Bay...",1328832000,2,663,4.61864406779661
