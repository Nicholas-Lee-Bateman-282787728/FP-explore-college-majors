1825213,5,B000083C4A,"i'm definately a big lexx fan, but i didn't get hooked on the show until the third season and therefore had not seen the majority of the second season episodes.  So lucky day for me i've been seeing them for the first time on this series of dvds.  the episodes really start heating up and getting good here on volume 4.  everything about the show from the writing to xenia seeberg's performance as eva haberman's replacement for zev/xev has gone up about 10 notches.  the special features on this disc were about 80% as good as ones on the other discs, but the real bonus is having these fantastic episodes for your collection.  if you are a lexx fan you should already own this!  if you've never seen lexx before then you should start it right and get the original 4 movies (""i worship his shadow"" ""supernova"" ""eating pattern"" and ""giga shadow"").  As already mentioned they are only available in canada (on dvd... you can buy the VHS version here on amazon under the original title ""tales from a parallel universe"") but i got the dvds easily enough on ebay.  so there you have it.  LEXX IS GOOD!",1009065600,6,1096,4.494949494949495
1825214,5,B000083C4A,"I Love the LEXX! If you want to see a suspence filled show with comedy and fun all mixed in one you have to see lexx it's almost like startrek's insane twin. Michael McManus who plays KAI is very funny in the ""TWILIGHT"" episode (2.13) Where planet Ruuma is messing with him because it has weird life giving powers.
Once you see Lexx TV shows on SCI FI cannel starting again...You will be hooked on all the DVD's Even the ones not availible in the U.S.(availible only to CANADA, Who said you can't go there buy them and bring back here) P.S. If you have relitives living in that country ask them to get it for you for Christmas ... It's still not too late yet!!!!",1003968000,,662,4.261904761904762

7978710,1,B000083C4A,"Season four of The Lexx is a great disappointment. The planets Fire and Water, which were very interesting in season 3 have been destroyed, and now the Lexx and crew experience ""the little blue planet"" a ""type 13 planet in its end stages"" meaning Earth.

There are a few laughs, but the shows in season 4, even with the talents of Bunny and Prince are not very well written and in many cases just plain dumb.",1277164800,,408,4.368421052631579
7978711,5,B000083C4A,"Buy all the Lexx series! Everyone should watch Lexx!
The series is very funny and sexy. Lexx is original and refreshing.",1187481600,,120,4.761904761904762
7978712,4,B000083C4A,"Okay, this volume is a definite step up from the stumbling volume one in this series.  However, there is a tendency for careless filmmaking in these episodes.  There is a lack of continuity in a couple episodes, not to mention a couple episodes are wrapped up with poorly written plot devices.  But a lot of the classic Lexx humor that was mostly absent from vloume one has returned.  Here are the episodes:
4.05 Xevivor--Xev, now a cult celebrity due to the exposure in episode ""P4X,"" is offered the chance to take part in a parody of the TV hit show ""Survivor"" where ten hyper-masculine men with biceps to spare vie for the chance to have one glorious, televised intimate encounter with Xev of B3K.  Stanley enlists the help of Robot Head 790 to find his way on to the show as a wild card contestant.  There is plenty of great humor in this episode.  It's just too bad the ending was so poor, with an incredible lack of continuity when Kai arrives suddenly after being told by 790 that he is an hour's flight away.  This could have been a classic in the series.
4.06 The Rock--This is easily the worst episode here, with the script, time and again, crossing the line from sexy to just plain dirty.  In a previous episode Stanley was given the title of King of Newfoundland by President Priest, and in this episode he comes down to claim his title with some slightly humorous moments.  The ending of this episode was another ridiculous moment; and there was another lapse in the continuity so that all three main crew members could be together while the ridiculous ending wrapped things up.
4.07 Walpurgis Night--This is where this particular volume picks up some speed with a parody of Dracula.  Although the character of Renfield could have been much more interesting, and the Boom Operator dips the microphone into view at one point, there are three alluring Goth chicks that come to dine with the Count at the Feast of Walpurgis.  Near the end Stan rallies the townsfolk to march up to the castle after giving a mangled version of the ""Freedom"" speech from the movie ""Braveheart"" with the rallying cry of ""Dead Thing Pie!""  See the episode and that last part will make humorous sense.
4.08 Vlad--Yes!  This is one of those rare Lexx episodes where I was actually concerned for the safety of the crew, particularly Kai who battles Vlad, a Divine Executioner from the Light Universe.  This episode has some crazy camera angles that add some excellent flavor to the insane proceedings, and the ending is very satisfying.  This episode captures The Lexx magic that has been strangely absent from this series thus far.  Well done!
Overall, this was entertaining, with a great last episode that makes me want to watch the next volume as soon as possible.  Take it easy.",1086393600,,2768,4.6721649484536085
7978713,4,B000083C4A,"4.5 stars.  After stumbling a little on the last volume, volume 4 finds The Lexx in full flight.  And except for the final episode, the humor and excellent satire has returned.  Here are the episodes:
2.13 Twilight--Stanley falls ill and via a little coaxing from Xev the Lexx travels to a planet with a handful of people promising a cure in exchange for a hitched ride.  The living inhabitants hate each other, but in a humorous way, and the dead rise and crave living flesh due to the strange radiation emitted from the planet. This radiation has an odd effect on Kai, who is already dead, and he prances about spouting poetry in a very campy way.  Xev is bitten by one of the zombies and looks sick, so Stanley asks if she is alright.  She replies, ""I can smell your brains!""  This is a fine parody of the popular Horror sub-genre; and the character standby, Lyekka, makes a very sexy appearance as well.  Kudos to her costume designer!  Yowza!
2.14 Patches in the Sky--The Lexx goes psychedelic!  Stanley bullies a robot leader from a robot mining colony into providing him with some form of entertainment or he will command the Lexx to destroy its planet.  The robot leader suggests he try the Narcolounger, a device in which he can manipulate his dreams.  Given Stanley's recent history of sleep deprivation and nightmares this Narcolounger sounds like Heaven.  But the reality is uncontrolled, nightmarish insanity!  There are also blank patches appearing in the sky assumed to be areas destroyed by Mantrid drones.  This is macabre and trippy stuff!
2.15 Woz--This is one of the funniest episodes thus far in the series!  This is a grand parody of ""The Wizard of Oz."" Xev is told by 790 that she, being a manufactured Love Slave, was given an expiration date and will die soon.  790 suggests they travel to Woz where there may be a proto-type machine that could be used to reset Xev's epiration date.  Story summation: the crew hop in a Moth and fly through a twister only to land on an assassin wearing red-and-white socks, Kai and Stan bargain for Xev's life and agree to kill The Dark Lady then discover a Love Slave colony, Xev is subjected to a hilarious reel of ""real women have curves"" propaganda while being shown The Brightness; and finally, Xev says those immortal words, ""There's no place like home.""  This is a sparkling gem in the series!  A must-see-episode!
2.16 The Web--This is where the DVD falls apart.  All the characters are unendearing and uninteresting.  Stanley is more interested in finding his hat than saving his friends, 790 has nothing to do but utter 101 insults at Stanley(I've never heard this many before, and it gets old fast), Kai has never been more dead, and Xev just seems baffled by everyone's angry and/or indifferent behavior.  All the comedy is absent here, though the story is halfway decent with some exceptional special effects.
However, don't let that last negative criticism alter the fact that this is easily one of the best volumes in the second series.  Have a crazy journey!",1084838400,2,3033,4.733333333333333
7978714,5,B000083C4A,"I am not a fan of sci-fi. i am not even a big fan of tv shows. but one night, i accidentally came across LEXX. I still to this day don't know why I watched the whole episode that i did, but i have been hooked ever since. If i was not around to watch it, I had to tape it.
For a show that's on the low end budget scale with cheesy effects, i find myself asking why do i watch a show, that not a single one of my friends, or family or work buddies have ever heard of! The reason is simple, LEXX is very origonal, funny, and believe it or not, smart. Where Star trek boldly goes, LEXX just wants to survive. Each Character is so compelling that you actually care about them. Stanley, the ... captian by mistake, Xev, the bombshell vixen warrior who constantly craves [love] but can't get it, and kia, the dead hero of the show (the mr. spock so to speak). I started watching during season 2, and watched every episode since. Try to catch it on the sci-fi channel, then buy any one of these dvd sets. It's very entertaining and never takes itself seriously, the ... graphics are hidden behind great acting (seriously) and complex but hilarious most of the time plots. Give it a shot...please.",1047340800,3,1188,4.237885462555066
7978715,4,B000083C4A,"The first four episodes of Series Four were kind of lackluster, though they all had their high points.  But starting with Xevivor, Series four chugs down some serious octane.
In Xevivor, Xev is both the prize and the judge in a reality show that is ultimatly attacked by savage carrots.
In the Rock, Stan becomes the King of Newfoundland.  He has finally traveled far enough across the two universes to meet himself.  Kai does a nice improv of the BrunnenG war song.
Walpurgis Night and Vlad both take place in Transylvania where Kai meets one of the few beings deadlier then he is.
Everyone should buy this and all the other Lexx DVD's and maybe they'll make a sequil to this wonderful series.  But, probably not.",1047254400,,714,4.642857142857143
7978716,3,B000083C4A,This is probibly the weakest of the Lexx DVD but if you are a rabid Lexx fan than it is still worth the purchase.  It slowly moves the story closer to the final confritation with mantrid as the crew realises that the Universe in being absorbed by Mantrid's drones.  Some very funny scenes but all together not up to usual Lexx wit.,1025827200,,331,4.32258064516129
