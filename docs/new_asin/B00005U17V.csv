The purpose of the video is to get the child to hear the classical music.  I remember when I was a child watching old cartoons that played classical music in the soundtrack.  Years later when I was formally exposed to these musical pieces I recognized them.  That is what this tape does.  Later as your children grow up they will be able to appreciate the music by itself.

Is this tape better than Baby Mozart or Baby Bach?  Hardly.  In fact, I would probably give this video 3.5 stars and the Baby Mozart and Einstein 4.5 stars (I take off half a star for their blatant marketing of toys to the kids).",1125360000,,852,4.438709677419355
7954243,1,B00005U17V,"This was formerly called Baby Maestro (same thing, they just changed the name to Your Tiny Maestro now). I had an expectation before viewing this. I thought the puppets would have different musical instruments and maybe talk about them. Mostly this is just all kinds of puppet scenes, most of them very short. No real rhyme or reason to them. Different symphonies are played in the background and the music is good. Occassionally there is a live-action shot of a real animal. To me it is just silliness. There is not a lot of speaking and I really don't know what the purpose is for this video. You might as well let you child watch Sesame Street. The first time we viewed this my baby was 17 months old. She lost interest very quickly. We also have Your Tiny Jungle Tot and she likes that one. I think that one teaches more, since it shows animals at the zoo and gives facts about them. I'm really not sure what Your Tiny Maestro is supposed to be teaching, if anything. We also have Your Tiny Artist and that one is a little better then Maestro, but I decided to only keep Jungle Tot (why put dumb and meaningless videos in for your child to watch??).",1116374400,,1153,4.392523364485982
