Like most movies of this sub-genre, it can be a little slow moving as you are learning more about the dynamics of and between the characters, but it's well-done and interesting.

7365631,4,B013HS2A5E,"Simon Castle (Rainn Wilson) is a billionaire who has created a lab in downtown LA for MIT grad David Kressen (Mark Webber). David has created an Artificial Intelligence (AI) named Adam (David Clayton Rogers). He has invited reporter Joy Andrews (Lucy Griffiths) to write a story on their work.

The film has the plot and feel of EX MACHINA with the gender role reversals. The twist I saw after an early chess game. This is a slow moving science fiction drama that offers nothing really new to the genre.

Well, I think I just found a sleeper hit with this one. You don't necessarily have to be into artificial intellective cyborg type movies to appreciate this type of flick. Actor David Clayton Rogers did an outstanding job portraying his role. Remember that this is not a high budget and over publicized Hollywood flick. This is a sophisticated sci-fi indie film. It should be appreciated for what it is. The originality and use of camera shots kept my attention focused on exactly where the Director wanted it. I felt as if I had missed something after every scene. The old magicians trick!

Its very creepy to think what an artificial intelligent robot/cyborg would do if were capable of questioning our motives. What would it do if were able to self evolve through technological advancements it was capable of achieving on its own? This should be added to other great films like 2015 ""Ex Machina"" and 2014 ""Transcendence"" questioning the possibility of technological advancements. ""So you want to create a god? Your own god?"" ... ""That's a very good question. Isn't that what man has always done?""

If you like these types of movies then definitely check it out.

While Lucy Griffiths delivers, Uncanny feels twice as long as its 91 minutes. About 20 minutes in, you'll start asking yourself: Where is this story taking me? Is it an updated Frankenstein? Will there be a Dr. Eldon Tyrell fatality (Blade Runner)? Is it going to have an intellectual ending, or will it turn into a slasher flick? I'll let somebody else spoil the intent for you (or you can find out for yourself), but suffice it to say that suspense is not always an admirable quality in film.

You'll probably recognize the four actors (yes, 4 is the entire cast). I fell for Lucy Griffiths during her brief but memorable time as one of Eric's progeny in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood/dp/B00N176ZBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood</a>. Mark Webber and David Clayton Rogers both have longer filmographies than Lucy, but it seems that Griffiths was the only character who was cast well. Rainn Wilson was the 4th character, and while he actually is a good fit for the role, if you know who Dwight Schrute is then it kind of throws water on the fire (what a difficult typecast to break!)
 Minus one star for uncanny casting choices.

The plot isn't bad. We've seen this scenario before, and since artificial intelligence and the technological singularity will likely become predominant themes of 21st century life, we can expect dozens or hundreds more such movies in your lifetime.
Although the dialogue in Uncanny is at times captivating, it flounders too often with awkwardness. Better to err on the side of intellectual than infantile, but a mixture of both is not an endearing quality.
 Minus one star for a noticeable trend of holes in the dialogue and plot.

7365652,3,B013HS2A5E,"Uncanny has a lot of similarities to Ex Machina.  But I think Ex Machina was more science fiction and wasn't really about exploring the human condition.  Though you could certainly interpret it that way.  Uncanny on the other hand, is much more about the deeper and darker recesses of the human soul.  It reminds me a lot of films based on HP Lovecraft (complete with drawn out scenes, bad acting, and a protagonist who reminds me a little of Jeffrey Combs).  I think in Ex Machina the audience is meant to follow and understand the technical conversations, while in Uncanny the technobabble is more like arcane discussions of the occult and the hardware, white boards, and computers are kinda like talismans for unholy rituals.  It's much more of a classic horror film than Ex Machina, so you should know what you're in for..

It's a bit of a different film than what I'm used to, but you have to be in the mood for something very slow paced with creepy music and people acting very strangely.  After around forty five minutes, its slow pace really started to get to me.  And for what it's worth, I did predict the ending fairly early in the film.  I think Uncanny would have been a pretty awesome movie if it was about half as long.

7365656,3,B013HS2A5E,"Hollywood has never been noted for its inventiveness. When studio X decides to shoot a Mars movie, studios Y and Z immediately rush off to commission Mars movies of their own. In this way they are rather like venture capitalists: they don't want to miss out on a new angle and so everyone invests in their own ""great next new thing.""

The movie Ex Machina featured the plot of a tech genius holed up in a remote Fortress of Solitude with a life-like cyborg that was used to perform a version of the Turing Test (can a real human tell whether or not the machine is a machine or a human?) on a nave invitee. In Ex Machina the twist is that the cyborg cleverly exploits her female characteristics to play both her creator and the love-struck invitee in order to effect her escape. In Uncanny the plot is (yes, you guessed it) a tech genius holed up in a lab with a life-like cyborg and a nave invitee in order to perform a version of the Turing Test.

Unfortunately, where Ex Machina was an interesting exploration of how our perceptions lead us to make judgments, Uncanny is just your standard ""here's the big reveal you didn't see coming"" movie except that it's difficult not to see the big reveal after watching the movie for less than five minutes. Which means that, absent the clever stuff about how our human perceptions work, it's just a long slog through predictable scenes that lead up to a highly predictable ending. So where Ex Machina deserved at least a B+, Uncanny gets no more than a C-.

If you don't mind predictability and very little else, this movie will while away an hour or so but if you want clever, you'll need to look elsewhere.",1452384000,,1651,4.460264900662252

""The Biggest Scientific Discovery In Human History Is Not Human""  - ""Uncanny"" trailer tag

Four and a half THOUGHT-PROVOKING Stars. ""Uncanny"" is a mind-bending movie experience that will require two viewings to get the full effect. The story concerns a brilliant scientist who invites a very scientifically-adroit female writer to view his artificial intelligence humanoid, Adam, interact for a week, and evaluate the experience, culminating in her writing a magazine article. Adam has been around his creator for years and it shows some unexpected emotions. This is a well-paced film that held my interest right up through the ending. It is similar to ""Ex Machina"" in the format of having an outsider evaluate the AI humanoid for a week, but that's where the similarity ends. See the movie twice to really understand what the plot was about and how well the writer and the actors pulled it off. Starring the excellent cast of Mark Webber, Lucy Griffiths, David Clayton Rogers, and Rainn Wilson as Castle. Written by Shahin Chandrasoma. Directed by Matthew Leutwyler, Highly Recommended.

But instead of an engaging story with fleshed out characters, the film is stuffed full of unnecessary technobabble and dreary philosophizing - 90 minutes of exposition and didactic speeches. Where's the drama? Where's the story?  But that's not even the biggest problem, which is the big nonsensical plot twist that makes the entire film utterly pointless.

As a side note, here's an example of some pseudo intellectual mumbo jumbo: in one scene, a character explains that he imagines people are surrounded by ""mini electromagnetic fields that decay over time"". In actuality, there's only one electromagnetic field and it's everywhere throughout the universe, and it doesn't decay. There's no such thing as ""mini electromagnetic fields"". Light. Radio waves. Microwaves. Infrared heat. These are all examples of electromagnetic radiation. It's everywhere, there's nothing special about it and people don't have their own individual bubbles of it. It's not even that his description is ""wrong"" (which it is) but that it's complete gibberish. It's like saying two plus two equals salmon. The movie is filled with this kind of pretentious, multi-syllabic gibberish.

**** plot twist SPOILER ***

If you don't want the big twist revealed, stop reading now.

The big twist, revealed in the last 10 minutes is that the inventor & android have actually swapped roles in order to fool the tech journalist who's spending a week with them. The person you think is the genius inventor is actually the android and the supposed android is the the real human. This reveal makes the entire film pointless & nonsensical. Even when the journalist isn't present, these two characters maintain their swapped roles and have conversations that, in retrospect, make no sense. In one scene, the android (pretending to be human) even makes a comment about the human (pretending to be the android) not having an anus. This is a patently absurd thing that to say in private when no one else is listening.

During the big climax, the journalist is tied up and believes the robot-gone-mad is about to murder the human inventor (who she has implausibly fallen in love with), when in reality the real human is simply removing a data storage device from the android. Instead of telling her the truth, he allows her to think he is murdering her lover. He's about to reveal the entire deception anyway so why not tell her before he does the operation? Why let her suffer this kind of trauma? It's cheap manufactured drama and makes the inventor character a sociopathic creep.

Uncanny is a low budget slow paced movie which you can't help compare to the much more effort put into similar plot movies and TV shows out there. Actors portraying robots have been done so much better in Humans and movies such as Exmachinia, Eva and others. The actor playing Adam wasn't convincing at all as a robot which was essential for you to buy into the plot. The actor playing David couldn't have made the character any duller, it made little sense that the journalist was clearly trying to make herself hotter and hotter each day to impress him. The movie was also extremely predictable, I think the makers thought we'd be blindsided and so impressed by the ending that we would forget how bored we'd been up to then, but that ending has been done (and done better) in countless other scifi films.

Uncanny is different.  It's got a wicked twist at the end that I definitely didn't see coming.

I wanted to give it 5 stars, but two things detract.  First, there are a couple of scenes earlier that don't quite jibe with the ""surprise"" at the end.  And second, the gratuitous political commentary about government surveillance at the very end seems like a tacked on afterthought.
