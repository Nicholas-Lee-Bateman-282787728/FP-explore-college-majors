8032133,5,B0002US50A,To this day a 1yr 1/2 later My clients love this technique The giant stones do feel like hands on their body while im massaging the rest...so recommend this. Some therapist get tired after a while but the whole experience of doing it this way is what makes you as a therapist unique to each client Carollanne is flow smooth relaxing But I would love to find her metaphoris stones some day until then I use natural giant stones from the lake and basalt Also in my experience I find if a client is tight I start with a 5-10min stretch/massage on back and all over because laying still when tight tends to be uncomfortable with heavy giant stones on body nut I also recommend that to listen to their body and if they need to move! or let me know no worries...,1446681600,,756,4.293706293706293
8032134,2,B0002US50A,"I couldn't decide whether to give this video a two or a three. There are things I really like about it. It has some wonderful nuts and bolts info on the properties of the stones and tricks for controlling the temperature. It presents techniques that are different from the typical hot stone massage. I use them on myself on cold winter days and it's luxurious, but I would NEVER, EVER use them on a client. According to the abmp, there have been many lawsuits over burns since hot stone got started, and the easiest way to burn a client is to have him or her lie on stationary stones and/or to lay stationary stones on the body. Hot stones MUST stay in motion to reduce the risk of burning. My malpractice company made me agree not to use this practice before granting me my POI.
In general I recommend Real Bodywork videos because they are usually very high quality and very instructional. This one should be redone, and I see they have a Hot Stone 2 now, which I plan to check out.",1371600000,4,983,4.377049180327869
8032135,5,B0002US50A,"This video gives precise protical for giving an excelent massage using stones. I also enjoyed the added portion on stone placement. It's so soothing to watch, you may nod off!",1158451200,,175,4.866666666666666
8032136,5,B0002US50A,"I have been practicing massage almost 2 years. Im just getting into hot stone, I have seen other videos, and liked this one the best.  It gives more than hot stone, also a briefing on cold stone, and also hot stone on the meridians.  I liked her explaination of the hot stone, and also the healing purpose of the  few different meridians were helpful, and the stone layouts for each of the maridian. This gave me some ideas for my business.  I thought it was helpful.",1138579200,14,467,4.395348837209302
8032137,5,B0002US50A,"I have been a massage therapist for 10 years, and decided to learn stone massage. I purchased this DVD and was very happy. I found the filming on the beach to be peacful and the pace of the program was great. I also know a bit about meridians, and this DVDs presentation of meridian work was a great adjunct to the already complete hot stone massage sequence. A friend of mine showed me the hot stone video that she purchased, and it was not as comprehensive or well done as this one. This video has alot of extra information that I really appreciated.",1136764800,7,552,4.368932038834951
8032138,2,B0002US50A,"First, may I say I am a fan and supporter of Mr. Riehl's work; he's not only a fantastic therapist but his instructional films in the past are worthy of repeated viewings.

This DVD unfortunately does not fit the same mold.

If one wants to learn a general hot stone massage sequence to fill in for a friend at the day spa, this DVD will provide what you're looking for.

However, I feel it's fair to state it's not well-filmed, and the woman is a therapist, NOT a good speaker/performer.

All in all, a little more film on the cutting room floor and a bit more research should have been done before shrink-wrapping this Hot Stone Massage Comedy.",1128124800,14,646,4.4491525423728815
8032139,5,B0002US50A,"This DVD is very well filmed, and does an excellent job of teaching  stone massage. I was suprised at how much information is contained- a cool moonstone fascial as well as six advanced layouts, plus the basic hot stone massage. This is a great DVD for anyone wanting to learn stone massage. I have applied the techniques in my practice, and my client's love it!",1113091200,9,362,4.569230769230769
8032140,3,B0002US50A,"This is more a question. Does the contents of this DVD equals the 2 VHS tapes?

As a Reiki master in The Netherlands I like to introduce the method of stone healing in combination,  or seperated from Reiki. I have no massage experience. Can somebody please advise me on the subject massage e.g. books, DVD or video tapes.

Thanks for your Cooperation

8032141,5,B0002US50A,"If you want to learn hot stone massage and are unable to take a class, this is the video to get!  The video is quite informative, and includes not only contraindications, but also the history behind the hot stone massage, using different types of stones, and the benfits of using both hot and cold stones and when to use them.
Carollanne Crichton does a wonderful job narrating the video and explaining in detail how to use the stones and where to place each one for the maximum benefit of the client.  She goes though a basic full body massage using the stones, and also demonstrates a soothing facial massage using cold stones, as well as a sequence of laying the stones on all of the organ meridians.  What I especially liked was the cautioning and explaining thoughout the basic massage so that one's client receives the maximum benefit and the therapist is performing the hot stone massage correctly.  The answer and questions at the end of the basic massage answsered all of my lingering questions!
This video is superb for the therapist wishing to add another technique to his or her practice.  I have practiced on family and friends and have received nothing but the highest compliments - they all loved it!
I highly recommend this video.",1053302400,33,1246,4.723502304147465
8032142,5,B0002US50A,This is the most complete stone massage video I have seen. It covers alot of information- and it is beautifully filmed and easy to follow. After watching the video I was able to start doing stone massage with confidence!,1036886400,29,220,4.666666666666667
