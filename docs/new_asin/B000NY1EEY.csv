8182395,4,B000NY1EEY,"The COLGATE COMEDY HOUR stuff on ths set is nice enough. Of course quality of these is limited as source material is antique kinescopes. Images tend to appear a bit fuzzy but watchable, especially if you remember the days of TV antennas and out-of-town signals.

This box is absolutely worth owning simply for its fine dub of the charming modern fairytale, JACK AND THE BEANSTALK It looks wonderful! Vibrant colors, sharp image, clean sound. I have never seen a better copy anywhere.

In the sepiatone opening, babysitter Lou falls asleep and dreams in Cinecolor that he's Jack of the fable. Bud plays avaricious Mr. Dinklepuss in a dream that includes a few musical sequences, the giant, a prince and princess, a goose that lays golden eggs and a harp who speaks with a brogue. Lou's song, ""I Fear Nothing When I Am In The Right"" is a favorite moment.

The equally good-condition AFRICA SCREAMS has a cast of comedy favorites going on African safari with famous explorer Beatty and big game hunter Buck. Many here were Season One regulars on THE ABBOTT & COSTELLO SHOW. This independently made comedy long ago fell into the public domain. It's vintage A&C.

8182396,3,B000NY1EEY,"I'm probably being generous with the three stars. This 2-disc set contains another of the endless releases of ""Africa Screams"" plus three Colgate Comedy Hour shows. Also ""Jack And The Beanstalk in another so-so print with the added insult of not even being in color! So why the three stars? Well the two-disc set is very affordable (I snagged it for 5 bucks!). Also, an added bonus feature is an episode of ""This Is Your Life"" saluting Lou Costello! If you haven't picked up the ""This Is Your Life"" box set, here's another chance to get this extremely touching episode. Lou Costello will tug at your heart strings! Forget the rest of this set. Just get it for this wonderful piece of TV history.",1302048000,2,695,4.612903225806452
