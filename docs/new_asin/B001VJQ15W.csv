8346585,1,B001VJQ15W,Do not buy this version of the movies.  The subtitles of the Sioux Native Americans are all in French.  Why an English version isn't available is beyond any kind of common sense known to man.  Save your money or wait for the English version.,1314144000,,241,4.431818181818182
8346586,1,B001VJQ15W,"I was so excited to watch this directors cut,extra footage and all that,but as i was 45 minutes in i realized this version was worthless as to follow the movie,you need to know what the natives are saying and unless you speak or read french,you will end up turning it off as i did.wait for the official US release.lets hope the directors cut will be available.",1289520000,3,360,4.46969696969697
8346587,3,B001VJQ15W,"I wanted to give some information on this release that may be important to potential buyers.  First off, though, let me state that I rated it three stars purely in terms of picture quality -- the picture quality overall does not live up to the Blu-ray format.

OK -- now for the info:

1)  This is the French Blu-ray release.  Subtitles are only in French.  They are optional, meaning you can turn them off.  If they're on, you get French subtitles for EVERYTHING, i.e. for both English and Lakota Sioux dialogue.  If you turn the subtitles off, you get NOTHING, i.e. no subtitles for the Lakota Sioux dialogue either.  The point is, if you don't read French, and you don't understand Lakota Sioux, you'll miss a lot of the dialogue in this film.  Hey, it's a French release; what do you expect?

2)  The film itself is region-free, i.e. it plays fine on a standard U.S. (Region A) Blu-ray player.  However, the Special Features are in Standard Definition, not HD; as this is a French release, they're encoded in PAL/SECAM, not NTSC as they would be in the U.S.  This means that if you have a standard Region A Blu-ray player, the Special Features will give you sound only -- NO PICTURE!!  You need a multi-region or European player to get the picture.",1275004800,9,1252,4.551569506726457
8346588,3,B001VJQ15W,"Wow, this is a powerful movie. I recently rewatched it after several years and suddenly remembered what really makes a great movie. I love how ""Dances with Wolves"" begins with an intimate portrait of the American West, from the vast plains to the charismatic wolf ""Two-Socks"". The film follows Kevin Costner's emotional but nuanced journey from disillusioned Army officer to Sioux patriot. The acting is superb all around. There are no shallow characters, even within the U.S. Army. Every character seems to have several layers of emotional complexity. ""Dances with Wolves"" is an emotional and visional treat. I can't wait until it comes out on blu-ray.

[note: this is the French version. If you can't read French, get the English version]",1263600000,3,740,5.115702479338843
8346589,1,B001VJQ15W,"This is the full length Director's cut. The English soundtrack is available however half the film is spoken in the Lakota Amerindian language. The sub-titles are only in French.  If you don't speak French, half of the movie will be meaningless.",1259020800,29,244,4.951219512195122
