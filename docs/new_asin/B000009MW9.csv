7905516,5,B000009MW9,"I watched ""All About Ah-Long"" years ago when I was still 12. Now 10 years have passed, I finally purchased the DVD and watched it again. I admit that I cried like baby when I watched it the first time. Now I am 22, I still cried like a baby. The story is just amazingly touching. I especially have to point out the little boy's acting in the movie was excellent. You would want to cry just seeing him cry. Chow Yun-Fat's acting was also very good. This was one of his early movies. I strongly recommend this movie!",1102550400,3,514,4.202020202020202
7905517,5,B000009MW9,"More and more, I continue to be introduced the majestic talent and ability of Chow Yun Fat, my favorite actor. This is a tear-jerking, heart-warming drama. For those of you who think all Chow knows what to do is walk around with guns and shoot people, you must see this movie. The little kid in it is hilarious. And Chow delivers one of the best performances of his career. If you love Chow Yun Fat, this is a must-see.",1017532800,2,419,4.3164556962025316
7905518,4,B000009MW9,"Chow Yun Fat stars as a truck driver who is raising his son along in this 1989 Hong Kong film directed by Johnny To!  Ah-Long's life is complicated when his former wife returns and they try to reform their family!  But then, in the end, he goes back to his earlier passion for racing motorcylces!  Chow Yun Fat's performance is one of his best (he won the 1990 Honk Kong Academy Award for Best Actor), but I sure did not see the motorcycle bit coming!  The climatic race is exciting, but it is like they spliced two different movies together!",1003708800,,542,4.39
7905519,4,B000009MW9,"This is film that has a great star at his best.  As Ah-long, a truck driving man trying to bring up his little boy in a walk up flat in a poor neighborhood, he is doing his best.  But there is not much hope for doing better.  A chance for the boy to star in  commercials comes along and rapidly everything changes.  And these changes are what make this film so moving.  Ah-long has to do some growing up and his choices are what make the film a tragedy.  Very good, but be prepared to have a few tears.",987984000,2,502,4.01010101010101
7905520,5,B000009MW9,"Try to not compare Chow Yun Fat with Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Wills!  Try to compare Yun Fat with Robert DeNiro.
He gives his best performance as single dad who has ups and downs  relationship with his son, Porky.  He tries his best to be good father to  his son, but Yun Fat's former girlfriend who is mother to Porky becomes  involve with the relationship between Yun Fat and his son.
Strongly  recommend you to watch it and promise you that you will watch it again and  again!",940032000,4,505,4.544444444444444
