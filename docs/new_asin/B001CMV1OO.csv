8288253,5,B001CMV1OO,"I love classic swashbucklers from the 1930s-50s, and am generally wary of attempts at the genre from the more-cynical decades since, but I took a chance on this series from 1979-1982 and am very pleased that I did.  Richard O'Sullivan makes a delightful Dick Turpin and these 26 half-hour adventures are engaging, witty, exciting, and just plain fun!  The picture and sound quality are quite good (especially for television of this era) and the acting, costuming, swordplay, music, and direction are excellent.

The stories concern the 18th-century highwayman after his supposed hanging at York in 1739.  It seems another highwayman, claiming to be Turpin, was hung in his stead.  Once that comes to light, Captain Nathan Spiker (David Daker) and Sir John Glutton (Christopher Benjamin) spend their days trying to capture the elusive Turpin, along with his sidekick Swiftnick (Michael Deeks).

Those who enjoy the classic Hollywood swashbucklers of the golden age will likely be happy with this latter-day television series.  It has the wit and delight of the best swashbuckler films, with a little bit more menace and grittiness -- though not so much as to detract from the fun.",1411084800,2,1179,5.141361256544503
