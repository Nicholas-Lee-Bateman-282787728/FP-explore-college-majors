1711444,4,B00006674V,"This movie is not perfect by any means.  But it certainly did some things right in my opinion.  This movie wove some pretty intense emotion into its action.  Sure there were parts of the voice overs that I didn't care for but as a whole, I thought that the animation was top notch as usual.  There is so much poorly drawn Anime out there that it is nice to see some level of detail in a movie.
I think what sold me on this movie was the action.  Armitage doesn't hold back at all in this movie.  I was drawn to her rage in the first movie.  And to see it return get me to really enjoy this film.  I wish they would have kept the same voice actors from the first for conistancies sake but I thought Juliette Lewis did a pretty fair job.
A lot of hardcore anime fans will probably hate this movie (like they did the first one), but for some fans, this is EXACTLY the type of anime I like to watch.  And NOT this dragon ball Z garbage that is flooding the market.",1025740800,,960,4.037037037037037
1711445,5,B00006674V,"I loved Armitage III: Poly-Matrix, so I pre-ordered Dual-Matrix as soon as I possibly could.  The differences between the two versions are like night and day, but they are both narratively excellent - fully engrossing and complete with twists and surprises.
The main difference between the 1980s Poly-Matrix and the new Dual-Matrix is the animation style.  This is similar to the difference between the original 1980s Bubblegum Crisis series and its late-1990s rehash.  In both cases, the latter versions use much ""cleaner"" animation; in the case of Dual-Matrix, there is a very heavy use of CGI, which creates some stunning visual effects, but is generally not very seamless at all.  This seamlessness detracts very much from the viewing experience and momentarily jars the spectator away from the narrative, in much the same way as Macross Plus or Blue Submarine No. 6; despite its relative ""age,"" the seamless use of CGI in Ghost in the Shell is still the benchmark which other anime series and films must strive to achieve.
Another difference is the voice-acting.  The North American audience has only commercially had access to the dubbed version of Poly-Matrix; the voice-acting in that film was absolutely brilliant, although not quite on the level of excellence of My Neighbor Totoro.  Although Juliette Lewis returns as the voice actress of Naomi Armitage in Dual-Matrix, her voice has definitely changed in the intervening years, which itself changes Armitage's personality in unexpected ways.  Unfortunately, she is the only returning voice-actor for the English dub, which also means that Ross Syllabus' personality undergoes severe changes with the new voice-actor.
Dual-Matrix is an excellent film, and is definitely one which any true anime fan should see and cherish.  However, those who have not seen Poly-Matrix will certainly miss a lot of the character motivation in Dual-Matrix.  While Dual-Matrix does begin with a brief synopsis of what has happened in the intervening years since the end of Poly-Matrix, it truly glosses over the details of the original film, resulting in utter confusion for those unfamiliar with Poly-Matrix.
Dual-Matrix is an EXCELLENT film, and the DVD balances this nicely with good extras.  Particularly interesting is the film trailer, which itself is worthy of awards.  The PlayStation2-compatible DVD is nicely constructed, and definitely worthy of a ""5"" rating :-)",1025654400,,2415,5.328947368421052
1711446,1,B00006674V,"I really enjoyed the first Armitage series, then turned to a movie.  There was actual character and story development, great animation, terrific concepts overall of robot/human relations, etc.  The sequel however, was a [sorry] rehash; using the basic premise of the societal problems in the first film, it portrays naomi as more of just a robot rather than the thinking feeling third that she is, and Ross as the hapless tag along... Poor computer graphics, repeated images, and panning across still landscapes fill this anime, giving it about 12 minutes of actual animation and 0 originality.",1025395200,2,594,5.177083333333333
1711447,1,B00006674V,"I wish Pioneer had given the directing of this movie to somebody who really cared about Armitage, becuase the result is a heartless sequel.  The computer generated graphics are lame, the voice acting is stale and the main characters are empty.  I haven't seen the original television series, but I have Poly Matrix on dvd and despite it's shortcomings, has become one of my favorites (I even bought the McFarlane figure).  The animation of Dual Matrix is cleaner, but the composition and style of Poly Matrix beats it hands down.  Further, the aspect ratio of this ""special edition"" is 4:3.  I'd have to recommend against it, and the fans of Armitage will be all the more disappointed.  Go get somthing else you've had in your wish list, or pop in the first movie if you're feeling nostalgic.",1024963200,,792,4.744525547445256
1711448,4,B00006674V,"I am going to try to calmly write a review with ideas in neatly arranged in some sort of order.
1st- acting... I feel very sorry for the voice actors in this movie.  Not that they were bad or anything, but pioneer didn't keep one voice actor the same, despite several characters that appear in the same movie.  That means that the actors not only had to live up to the japanese for subbies, but also to the old english ones for dubbies.  Juliete Lewis does quite the job.  Her voice is lower and rougher than Elizabeth Berkley's and her acting was quite good.  She give as much heart and soul as Elizabeth Berkley and she obviously had fun doing it.  Skip Stellrecht tried his best with Ross, and had a very hard time keeping his voice low.  He tried to match Kiefer Sutherlands, and he almost had me fooled sometimes.  Being a dubbie, I thought he was a little too...act-y for Ross, because I was used to Kiefer Sutherland's crude and flat Ross.  Yoko... oh boy, when I found out that rebecca fordstadt (mihoshi, tenchi muyo) was doing her voice, I was scared, then, upon seeing her performance, was quite pleased.  Her crying was a touch odd, but was her voice, not her acting.  Demitrio, michael mcconnohie was mediocre at best, sometime underacted, sometimes over acted, and sometimes right on, but nothing too special for a bad guy voice.  Mouse was played by the guy who does the voice for jar jar binks, ahmed best, and that scared me worse than the mihoshi thing, but again, I was pleasantly surprised. Very good, very wacky!  Strings... nothing too much here, just a flat military character.  As for Julian... Mona Marshall, all I can say to you is nice job not sounding like Izzy from DIgimon.  Music was GREAT!!! LOVE LOVE LOVED IT! Kudo's to Julian Mack.  Visuals... nice animation, very smooth, a little much on the computer, but still blended quite nicely.  Character designs were very true to the original.  Now the story of coursr, is the ultimate test.  You can't expect another Armitage III: Poly Matrix, you ahve to accept that it's a different kind of story, and I think the director is different too.  The action was very apparent, but hey if you're an armitage fan, you love that kick bum stuff! ^.^  The story didn't lose heart though, and explained some more of the politics that were left to crumble in the first movie.  It had a different feel to it, but it was still a good story.  I'm not very picky about DVD set ups or special features, I was just kind of like oo, fancy interviews and trailer... the most I can is that it was a very spiffy user friendly set up.  Besides a few random ... shots, the language and violence were no worse than the first, so maybe a PG-13.  Not too much comedy, except the random please (?) don't touch on the second's but and the kick in the balls that the bad guy deserves... I enjoyed this movie, and I hope you will find this review helpful and enjoy the movie youreself!!",1024876800,5,2936,4.473684210526316

1711465,4,B00006674V,"I enjoyed the sequel to the Armitage III OVA. Six years have passed since living under false identies on Mars. Former Detective Sylibus is now a security guard at a robot company. He has married his former partner Armitage and is now a father with a six year old girl. I did wonder in the age of biometrics, how they were able to evade being discovered by Martian authorities (child's birth, employment questions etc.) while on the run. There is a company on Earth that is starting up the Third project again, when they are wiped out under a government assualt. Armitage on Mars, receives their death signals and slips away from the house to go to Earth without telling her family members. I found this cold and impersonal since Thirds are suppose to have emotions. The story mainly focuses on Armitage as she uncovers the conspiracy of the private corporation trying to steal the secret of the Thirds reproductive abilites. The graphics are alright, fight scenes good, scientific priciples interesting and story line intricate. I don't think you'll be disappointed in the purchase of this DVD. Our society is moving towards AI in machines (""Big Blue"" etc.), nano technolgy, cloning etc. so I see these things happening one day.",1364860800,,1228,4.852380952380952

1711468,4,B00006674V,"I first saw Poly-Matrix on Sci-fi and it was one of the first 'mature' animes I had ever seen. A few years later I found Dual-Matrix sitting on the shelf in my local Target. I picked it up for fifteen and watched it through three times in a row. I was impressed with the story and, being 14, thought nothing of the voice acting. Just recently I sat down and watched both movies back to back for the first time in about five years.

My first and only complaint was that the voice acting wasn't as good as I remember it. While Juliette Lewis is a snag for her distinct voice, it didn't quite match up with Elizabeth Berkley's portrayal of the character. And hearing Jar-Jar Binks as Mouse the repairman wasn't too encouraging either. But overall, the acting was decent and is definitely a must-see for anyone who is a fan of the OVA/movie who hasn't seen it yet.

The story is set some years after the events of Poly-Matrix. Naomi and Ross are under assumed names and have a daughter named Yoko. They're living happily until an incident at a 3rd facility draws Armitage back into the fold again. While she hunts down those responsible, Ross (whose new identity names him Kevin Oldman) gets in trouble after killing robot thieves, while their human counterparts get away unscathed. He is sent to earth to attend a conference and there Yoko gets kidnapped by a new player who is after the secret to the third ability to conceive.

Where the first one was deep and you wouldn't get all the information if you weren't paying attention, this one gives it all to you up front and there's no 'it all comes together' feeling at the end. The animation is great, though some of the CG shots will make you question their purpose. Armitage and Ross stay pretty faithful to their first movie counterparts, which is refreshing, but the quality of the animation really shows how rough it truly is. Where Poly-Matrix was beautifully detailed, Dual-Matrix makes you wonder if the animation you're watching was complete at the time of release.

Overall, this movie is still a worthy sequel and well worth the money you might pay for it. But you should probably see Poly-Matrix first to get a feel for the characters and why what's happening is so important. Just don't let the voice acting and the sub-par animation/CG ruin it for you. I really enjoy this movie, and watching it again after five years cemented that and has me wondering why I waited so long to watch it again.",1316476800,,2456,4.575

1711471,2,B00006674V,"As others have mentioned, these two discs/videos stand on their own; it's not necessary to be familiar with the character of Armitage beforehand.  The cell work is somewhat average, certainly at this point in time (2008), and the soundtrack/music really don't stand out.  English dubbing for both is second-rate: Even though Keifer Sutherland and Juliette Lewis provide voices to the two main characters (Keifer in Armitage III and Juliette in Armitage), they sound like they're reading a passage from a book, and put little, if any, feeling into their lines.
The script is cliche, and the characters' actions don't reflect their supposed experience/intelligence or capabilities: why would someone who was previously a police detective take his daughter on trip to a conference involving a politically volatile issue (robot rights), when he's already seen the lengths the government will go to in order to suppress information? Potential for assassination or hostage-taking, anyone?  I've read reviews indicating that Armitage III is a hack of a four-part anime series, and about an hour was cut out.  That might explain the jerky plot, though it doesn't excuse the script",1202428800,,1172,5.318918918918919

Humans create robot sophisticaed enough to pass off as human, the most advanced ones can conceive a child with the help of a human male. Much like in the animatrix, things escalate to the point were we must question if these robots are just tools, or individuals with minds of their own and our resposibility to them.

Cover ups, sabotage, banishment & discrimination, and love. Love being the strongest point of these stories. Both self preservation and mutual love.

The action is decent, the story line-I believe to be fairly solid and understandable. I tell you about the story because I believe that adds most of the intensity to this movie. I'd say maybe 1/7 to 1/5 of these movies are action sequences, and their done quite well, but that wasn't the selling point for me.",1202342400,,818,4.787234042553192

1711485,5,B00006674V,I am not a real big fan of Anime but my best friend one day showed it to me and i was amazed at how awesome it was. Great story line and stuff. my only true complaint is that they have a different voice actor for the main character in both movies,1178928000,,246,3.75
1711486,3,B00006674V,"The first time I saw this DVD sequel to one of the best animes of the '90's on the shelves, I was skeptical. When I saw that Juliette Lewis was doing the voice for super-sexy robot ...Naomi Armitage, my feelings were mixed, knowing her to be a competent actress with a sexier voice than Elizabeth Berkeley (and certainly sexier on screen). When I finally watched it...I was disappointed. And yet...I watched it again, and I liked it a little more, despite the flaws.
As a sequel, it's pretty standard. It acknowledges the events of the first movie (except of course for the funny plot hole of why nobody on Mars recognizes Ross or Armitage when they figured to be such prominent characters in a government conspiracy in the original). The sequel expands (not answers, but expands) on certain questions from the first, like how does a robot have the ability to conceive human children? The action is pretty good, almost as good as the original, and it wrap things up nicely in the end.
The major flaws with this sequel are inherent in the animation. It's just not nearly as good. The animators went a little overboard with the use of CGI for some of the vehicular chase scenes (which were pretty cool, but obviously out of place with the rest of the animation). The panning is far less smooth than in the original, probably another result of CGI...it just doesn't look the same. The character design is updated slightly to give a sense that the characters have matured slightly. The backgrounds and setting aren't all that great either, but...it is mostly on Earth, not Mars. Maybe they just didn't want to go too far with it. There's also a problem in the plot, which is almost a direct rehash of the original, only instead of the government being behind it, it's the big robot-producing corporations that have a lot to lose if robots are allowed to be treated as human. Politics come into play a little more this time around, but that hardly helps the case the plot is pretty much the same. Also, the cliched plot devices of taking the child hostage and of a mother protecting her child is played out in perfect form here. Armitage could take out an entire army to protect her child...and she pretty much does (well...two ultra violent clones of herself, which is pretty much the equivalent of an army...and those clones laugh way too much, you just wanna bash their heads in).
The pros of this movie are that in spite of these little details, it's still a far better sequel than most Hollywood sequels attempt to be. As I said, the action is really good. The extended fight between Armitage and Ross and her two clones is pretty good, especially considering that the clones are more than just programmed soldiers...they seem to have a sadistic side, laughing almost every time they think they're about to kill someone...which was annoying, but it does helping you to hate them. The additional characters like the daughter Yoko and Mouse the Repairman are pretty enjoyable too. Yoko plays out like a typical kid in anime movies, but she's far less annoying than you'd expect. The little twist near the end when we see what makes her more than just an ordinary human is well integrated, especially after the villian made a big deal about not finding anything special about her. Mouse is just funny. The music by Julian Mack is different...still electronic-based, but more orchestral elements are introduced, and the presence of a female voice in the theme is rather interesting.
All-in-all, the sequel did what it sought out to do, and while it's certainly not as good as the original, it does at least hold a candle. I hated it at first, but the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it, and the more I feel it's actually a pretty good sequel. This is just my opinion, so feel free to disagree, but I think ""Armitage: Dual-Matrix"" is pretty good.",1051488000,10,3843,4.661266568483064
1711487,4,B00006674V,"Let's face it, the story, animation and character development was better in the first Armitage film. BUT, this film is a decent sequel. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being anything related to Pokepuke, I give this film a 6.5.",1047859200,,220,4.261904761904762
1711488,4,B00006674V,"Poly-Matrix:
Armitage has long been one of my favorite animes. It's hard to describe much of the story without giving away at least small bits of the plot, I'll be rather brief. The basics of the story is about a cop, Ross, who travels to Mars and meets a female officer named Naomi Armitage. They get involved in solving a murder case involving a famous country singer.
The singer is found to be, shockingly, a machine. Issues are brought up about robots and the rights of machines. The robots are divided into various types, Seconds and the rumored mysterious Thirds take center stage. Many questions are raised and debated as the story progresses, it's very well written and thought out.
Ross himself is pretty much a normal Earth cop. He's calm and calculating where Naomi is quicker to act and fight. They make quite a great team. Ross pretty much gets dragged into the whole mess and keeps things well grounded. He stays cool under pressure and generally makes for one tough cop. Naomi is from the very outset a hardcore energetic fighter. She gets the job done using her own methods and lets no one stand in her way. If you make it through this movie without a soft spot for Naomi, you need to watch it again.
As the story progresses, clues appear and we dig deeper into the backgrounds of Ross and Naomi. The characters forge a friendship with new characters and enemies become clear and yet mysteries shroud everything. It will keep you guessing all the way through.
All in all, It's a very interesting anime that has managed to stay one of my absolute favorites for many years. It's well written, has plenty of action, and very memorable main characters. If you've never seen it, give it a shot. You'll have a great time.
Dual-Matrix:
Be warned, this will spoil some of the story to the original movie, Poly-Matrix. If you haven't seen that movie, I recommend you watch it first. Now, moving on the sequel we have Dual Matrix. Dual Matrix is set many years after the events of Poly-Matrix. Ross and Naomi did indeed have a child and named her Yoko. She's about 7 years old by now and completely unaware of her parent's past. They've changed their names and identities and are living on Mars trying to keep peaceful lives.
However, a horrible attack occurs killing several humans and robots. One of them contact Armitage before death, sending her its memories. She then quietly goes on a mission to find out just what's going on and take care of those responsible.
Ross in the mean time is dealing with his own issues on Earth with Yoko. Suffice to say when the action gets started it's just as good as old times. There are twists and turns that keep it interesting throughout, as well as a few new characters. Almost all the old favorites return and keep things interesting.
Naomi has changed a bit and isn't as hyper as she was the first time around. However, what she's lost in nubile cuteness over the years is more than made up for in experience. She's more of a hardcore fighter than ever before. Dual Matrix starts off somewhat slow, but quickly picks up into a very worthy sequel to the original movie.
The highlight of the movie is the ending and I assume its namesake. Naomi and Ross must survive a brutal fight against two enhanced Terminator style Armitage replicas while protecting Yoko. It's a dramatic and power set of scenes that will have Naomi fans beside themselves. If you liked Poly-Matrix, give this one a shot as well. You may enjoy it just as much or even more.

1711489,4,B00006674V,"What on the surface appears to be a political conflict between the Martian colony and the terrestrial parent government turns out to be an corporate economic struggle over the ability to make robots, and the rights that near human (or better) intelligences deserve to have.  Demitrio Mardini, of Earth Robotronics has devised a plan to use third generation cyborgs as breeding vessels for enslavable humans.  His ruthless plot puts one of the thirds, Naomi Armitage, her husband Ross Sylibus and their daughter Yoko square in his sights.
This is a pure techno-thriller.  Mardini kidnaps Yoko to force Ross to vote against the robot rights bill, and pry the secret of the thirds' ability to procreate from Naomi.  The couple fights back with everything they have, culminating with a series of tightly choreographed fights between Naomi and several of her evil twins.  In addition to the primary plot, the nature of being human is an important subtext, which finally reveals itself to be the primary theme.  It takes a robot to teach a human about love.
How much you like this feature may depend on how familiar you are with previous Armitage stories.  On its own, it is an interesting story with good artwork and animation.  Technology, of course, is ever present, but it doesn't overwhelm the more human aspects of the story.  Yoko's active role keeps centering the story back on its core values.  But the film is a bit flat and two dimensional when compared to previous Armitage efforts.  My guess is that long time fans will be less satisfied than newcomers will be.  Actually, the film relies very little on its precedents, so it is a good starting point.

1711490,4,B00006674V,"Take a good look at the cover of the ARMITAGE-DUAL MATRIX DVD, for this is what the animation is like: Animation that many people like, and many people hate (this applies to the regular DVD version; where I rent, the store doesn't carry the special edition, but this doesn't change anything I have said, although the cover is different, and looks a little better on the special edition). Some think it looks ""inexpensive,"" has slipped back to older, poor-quality animation. Some think it is wonderful. Some think that the dubbing by Juliette Lewis is bad. In my neighborhood, I haven't talked to one person -- so far -- that doesn't think the animation is fantastic, as is Juliette Lewis. Most agree the story line is weak, but some think it is great all the way around. So, what is going on here?

The people who made the film made an artistic decision that not everyone likes; they took a risk. In some ways, they -- in the CG World -- would be considered minimalists: Instead of flashy, bright colors, they chose to use colors -- especially on the characters -- that are very soft, but richness in colors is still there. The colors are such that at times it is very similar to turning the color down on your TV. But there is a smoothness and evenness throughout. Some of the buildings and structures and the night scenes of the city are breathtaking. There is a flatness similar to what could be achieved by hand, but still obvious that CG was used. Some scenes look like paintings. But three-dimensional-CG approach is there as well. Yes, some of the scenes are very dark-to the point where you can barely tell what is going on. In one of the scenes, you can't see anything at all. This obviously was intentional. When you see Armitage later, she looks as if she is barely holding it together, but determined to protect her family, especially her daughter, if it kills her. There were some complaints about things being left out. There wasn't suppose to be any reference to Armitage's husband being a former police officer -- but it is there, in the scene where he steals the car and says he is a police officer, with a hesitation and adding ""former police officer."" So, with some seeing the same things as good/bad, what is one suppose to do? Rent. That's what I did. I found the movie difficult to watch, and difficult to follow (a lot of work). I like it. Not enough to buy at this point. But it pointed me to the reviews, which pointed me to the OVA, which is to be released soon, which I plan to buy. Possibly, after that, depending on how much I like the OVA, I might buy ARMITAGAE-DUAL MATARIX (SPECIAL EDITION).",1036022400,5,2623,4.522105263157894

A gritty cyberpunk thriller raising serious questions about the future of our society when technoloy loves, hates and fears.  This sequel is almost unconnected.  The characters of Ross and Armitage have become all but manequins, Ross stumbles around with nothing much to do, his police background is all but forgotten and there even seems to be no mention that he has an artifitical arm and leg, as his same hand gets injured.
Armitage, a very strong and quite deep character has been rendered one dimensional, running around avoiding robots of different shapes and sizes, her motivation in the whole plot is shallow and unintersting.
A weak plot and script can sometimes be saved by good animation and design, but Armitage Dual-Matrix just looks uninspired, CGI is used throughout and sticks out like a sore thumb, looking out of place and [inexpensive].  The characters themselves don't look quite right, Armitage seems to have bizarre lip growth most of the time and she's just lost her charm and grace.
The dubbing is OK, though Juliette Lewis gives a wooden performance as Armitage (and you thought Elizabeth Berkley [was bad]?The original OVA voice was better than both movie versions.  Japanese vocal is far superior.
If you want cyberpunk anime, pick up the original series (now available on DVD) and avoid this cliche.",1033516800,16,1429,5.012658227848101
1711532,5,B00006674V,"My review will seperate the two titles.
Poly Matrix:
Our first movie to this double feature takes place on Mars. A detective from Earth named Ross Sylabus comes to Mars to help out with the police force and gets his first assignment the moment he gets off the plane. He also meets his partner, a sexy punk-girl named Armitage. The story centers around the war between human and robot rights for specific robots called seconds or thirds. However, Ross and Armitage have no idea what they're getting into.
The movie is pretty good considering it was condensed from 4 OAV episodes and made into a movie for an American release. Elizabeth Berkley (Showgirls) and Kiefer Sutherland (24 TV series) do a good job, but they sound more depressed and robotic, for better or worse. Extras include two text interviews and a trailer. Overall, the animation is great, the action solid, the music smooth and the story is stellar. Recommended.
Dual Matrix:
Years after Armitage and Ross get married, they have a child and name her Yoko. But all is still not right in the universe. A new law is being past for robot laws, but an edgy scientist doesn't want to risk anything on this law so he kidnaps Ross's daughter. And with two Thirds under his belt, he won't be taken lightly.
The animation, when compared to the last movie, is incredible. Most of the CG reminds me of Sol Bianica. In fact, the shuttle at the end of the movie looks almost exactly like the ship from Sol Bianica. The new voice actor for Armitage (Juliette Lewis) does a good job and maintains Armitage's attitude. However, Ross sounds a bit too upbeat in this film. Another thing worth noting is that the actor of Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars does the voice of Mouse. He tends to go into Jar Jar mode a few times, but he speaks way less babble than he did in Star Wars.
The music has been also been beefed up as well. There is some real nice guitar for the action scenes which I beleive does more justice to the film. The extras include a behind the scenes look at the making of Dual Matrix, three clean songs, trailer, production designs and Pioneer previews.
Overall, I enjoyed Dual Matrix. It's an action movie with soul. And if thats what you like, by all means, buy this now.",1032307200,9,2233,4.51604938271605
1711533,4,B00006674V,"I found this second Armitage film to be a wonderful continuation of the first Poly-Matrix.

 Wish the voices had stayed the same...but very rarely does that happen...and Juliette Lewis did a very good job still.

 I really enjoy the way this film shows how having a child and hiding from the government has affected their family. So when someone takes out a plant manufacturing IIIrds Armitage must investigate.

 Fascinating display of emotions and growing closer to her husband and daughter...I thought this film deserves two thumbs up overall.

 The story line was a little weak...but no more so than most sequels. I enjoyed the actions...and Armitage's evil counterparts were SUPER!

 Ending was superb in my opinion and I can't wait to purchase my own copy (Saw this one with a friend).

 Overall I would give it five stars....but it lacks that little something...so i'm rating it a wonderful four stars.

 ENJOY!",1031616000,,918,4.993377483443709
1711534,4,B00006674V,"This set packs both movies together which is the best way to go in my opinion. The first movie Poly-Matrix is nothing to get too excited about, it's not great only good. It lacks the amount storytelling and fight scene quality that the sequel has but still proves to be entertaining.
Dual-Matrix is where it's at, the stories stronger in this installment(though i won't give any spoilers). The fight scenes rock so hard you have to see it for yourself. So buy this set because Dual-Matrix is a must have and you wouldn't want to watch before its predecessor Poly-Matrix even if it isn't as good as Dual-Matrix. A deal no anime fan should miss.",1029110400,,643,4.6

1711536,4,B00006674V,"This production was better than Poly Matrix; the animation seemed cleaner and more alive.  The story continues Armitage quest for a normal life, but it gets interrupted when she needs to seek revenge for some 3rd`s that were murdered.  The story is a little weak, and perhaps Poly Matrix had a better story line.  The voice acting was more to my liking, the actresses for Armitage were about equal, though Ms Lewis was not as squeaky, but the actor for Ross was not as dark as Kiefer and this gives the film a less depressing tone.  If you liked Poly Matrix, you will probably enjoy Dual matrix.",1026864000,,595,4.5327102803738315
1711537,4,B00006674V,"I actually wandered one day into my local Best Buy and saw that this double-disc set was on sale, so I decided to take a risk and buy something I had never heard of before.  After having watched Poly Matrix, I was completely satisfied and eager to watch the 2nd film...  Armitage is a character that many people i'm sure can relate to; she often feels rejected and hated just because she is different and doesn't fit into the societal norm.  The story itself keeps the viewer interested and moves quickly in order to keep everything flowing.  Now the 4-star i'm giving Armitage doesn't necessarily mean it's not ""great.""  I consider the almighty 5-star to be near impossible to acquire mainly because I don't think there's a perfect anything.  Anyways, yes, buy this and enjoy it; you won't be sorry :)",1026432000,2,802,4.652482269503546

Great plot, fantastic art, stylistic combat, and something that
is rare in the mainstream movies--emotion.  Mother-daughter relationship and the pervasive sense of loss in Asian culture are the two themes.  Cannot miss with this film.  Top ten definitely.",1026086400,,317,5.408163265306122
1711539,4,B00006674V,"Armitage the Third was one of my more favorite Anime's.  I'm not a big anime addict, but the Anime that i do add to my library i make sure are some of the best.  So when i heard that the sequel for Armitage was out i bought it without even a first thought.  There was fighting, drama, a funny deally with the noses and some computer animation, and this really weird and escentric tech kind of guy.
Genre: Action Anime, contains violence and emotional content.  Nothing too much and definitely not too little.
Art Style: similar to the first.  The art uses a lot of Computer animated cells and somme of the character arts are slightly different.
Graphic Content: profanity is light, violence is average compared to other anime.  There is blood and brief nudity (both cheeks of our lovely heroine for all of two seconds).
This anime i was glad for having bought.  I really did like it.  It didn't leave you with a Heartbreaking Fondness like NowThenHereThere nor did it leave you with doubt for your own humanity and soul like Ghost in the Shell.  So for those who don't know the first one, this can be a little confusing.  The first anime was a high action anime that involved Armitage, a police agent with a big kick butt atitude and her new partner who doesn't know the things he is getting into.  Armitage is a robot... android, cyborg, this movie doesn't make the distiction.  Watching Duel Matrix will spoil the ending of Polymatrix (the first film), or rather spoil the slight shock value the ending of Poly Matrix has.  So i would recommend watching the first film before the second as it does contain events that require information acquired in the first film.  For those that have seen the first film it was great to see Armitage get up in her suit and kick some butt and it was even more amazing to see her fighting against herself in the climax of the movie (that isn't a spoiler, don't worry).  It was also good to see Ross, her husband, actuall doing some kick butt stuff too... but sometimes it did seem odd to see him doing some of the stuff he does after seeing how Armitage had trouble with it.
When the movie starts you won't even recognize them... it took me a while to realize that Ross was picking up his and daughter from school.  The cover to the DVD has armitage looking a little different than the cover of Poly Matrix, but it doesn't distract you or pull a Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal style swap with the main character.
This film gets close to the philosophical meanings inside of Ghost in the Shell but remains distant away enough to avoid being a psychological/philosophical movie (though it does use the terminology 'ghost' kinda like it was used in Ghost in the Shell).  There is a problem with the computer animation though.  That can be very distracting.  The panning action that the film uses can also make it look like a Pan and scan rendition.  There are so many instances when you would just have wanted them to make the movie all animated, the computer animation just stands out too much sometimes, especially in the car chasing.  But it doesn't remove from the movie's content at all.  The main focus of the movie is the relationship between mother and child, Armitage and Yoko, and well i won't ruin anything.  You'll figure it out when you see it.
The DVD is well putt together and it lacks some of the large intro int othe menu (for me at least).  The making of Armitage is pretty good and if you know how you have more fun with it on a DVD-rom (though there is no DVD-Rom specific area).  Like i usually tell anyone who isn't into anime, rent it first.  Some anime you buy watch and then might not touch for a while, a really long while, like Annon Saga.  Others, like Princess Mononoke, you might have a craving for once in a while.  For me, this isn't one of the movies i'll be watching over and over and over, just bring out every now and then, here and there.  :-)",1025913600,,3916,4.445378151260504
7961785,5,B00006674V,"I've owned both of these movies twice.  Third time's a charm, I hope.  Both times, I gave them away (not necessarily b/c I wanted to, but because the people I loaned them to loved the movies as much as I did and didn't want to return them...I guess I don't blame them).  Not having watched them in several years, I plugged them in to watch them and remembered what I loved about them.  Gritty, funny, and playful all at the same time.  Like most anime, though, with questionable content for minors, and some really strange goings-on, but overall, and especially if you like anime, I highly recommend them.

As for this disc collection, I have no problem owning them both in a thick DVD case.  It included a booklet for one of the movies (Dual Matrix), so as far as I can tell this one's complete.  Not a bad collection for such great cyber-punk/dystopia anime films.",1491868800,,866,4.506410256410256
7961786,4,B00006674V,"Chances are if you're reading this then you've seen the OVA, or are familiar with Armitage.  This is a story that has been told and retold.  The anime itself is entertaining, but tastes and opinions will vary wildly.  One thing I couldn't stand was the 1.85:1 aspect ratio for Poly Matrix was padded to 4:3.  I did eventually use Handbrake to crop the video, but zooming in probably would've worked fine, too. I don't think a 1080p reproduction is necessary (but it would be nice), but I see no reason why the aspect ratio couldn't have been padded for 16:9 instead. I rarely use physical media anymore, but I couldn't resist the urge to just watch the film before ripping it to my library.  I think the used price isn't bad, but the new price of $19.99 is too high, given the minor flaws.",1485216000,,789,4.451388888888889

7961792,3,B00006674V,"With the original OVA series being a cyberpunk smash, and the theatrically-released compilation movie(Poly-Matrix)making some waves with its ""star talent"", it was inevitable that a sequal would get made. This time, Armitage III is made into a legitimate full-length movie in Dual-Matrix. Although this film had an almost totally different production crew behind it.

Taking place about four years where the original OVA/movie left off, Armitage and Ross Sylibus have new identities on Mars and managed to have a daughter, despite the fact that Armitage is an android. Armitage receives a transmission of illegally-created Thirds being slaughtered in a military installation on Earth. Armitage heads to the blue planet ton confront the assault teams military commander, but it turns out he was secretly under orders of the slimy robotics executive, Demetrio. Ross on the other hand stopped an attack on a power plant in his new identity as a security officer on Mars, and gets roped into being a speaker for the Martian government for a new robotics bill being passed on Earth. Armitage meanwhile is being helped by an underground robot repairman named Mouse, who first sells out some of Armitage's secrets to Demetrio, but then vows to help Armitage after getting beaten up by his personal Armitage clones. Demetrio kidnaps Armitage's daughter Yoko in order to force the secret of robot reproduction out of her, so she and Ross reunite to rescue her. This follows a rather lengthy chase that leads to the family finally coming back together, and defeating Demetrio, partially achieved with some help from Armitage's ""brother"" Pluto.

Dual-Matrix was a fitting follow-up to the OVA, although maybe not to Poly-Matrix. Actress Juliette Lewis steps in to do the voice of Armitage this time, and possibly the best one so far, plus Ahmed Best(aka: Jar Jar Binks)actually does a serviceable job as Mouse. The animation has that cell-shaded turn of the century style to it a lot of anime did at the time like the original Appleseed CGI movie, but still holds up pretty well. It's probably better off being bought in the special 2-disc collector's set they did of both movies instead of the single DVD release.",1412121600,,2202,5.080110497237569
