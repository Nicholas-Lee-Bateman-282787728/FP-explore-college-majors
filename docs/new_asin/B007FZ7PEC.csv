5084317,2,B007FZ7PEC,Boring.  I love Kathy Smith but found this workout to be very boring.  But I will love kathy Smith and will continue to use her other tapes.,1371427200,,140,4.148148148148148
5084318,5,B007FZ7PEC,"I love Kathy Smith, but some of her workouts are better than others. This one is the ultimate fast workout for upper body. It is far, far better than volume 1 which goes way too fast with light weights. Here I use primarily her standing upper body workout and it has got my marshmallow upper body into shape within a few weeks. I will need more to be truly defined, but I look straighter, taller and younger with a less than 20 minute workout.

The key for me is to get straight off my treadmill (or come home from an outdoor run) and put this tape on right away. No warm-up needed and it means in 1 hr I work my upper and lower body. I combine with her awesome Abs workout DVD; I do bootcamp abs for ten minutes; and suddenly I'm liking my body.

This tape features a lift while balancing on one leg and twisting move that sounds complex, is not, and works your thighs. The hardest exercise has you lift weights out to the side (lateral delt raises), then pull them backwards slightly, and return. 12 of those and 8 overhead presses. Next triceps; then biceps (12) that move into some kind of push your arm forwards at the shoulder and up over your head (8). There's probably a fancy name for it. Next, rear delt raises sitting on a bench, some work contracting your back without weights (an active rest I guess), then stand up and do the first three exercises again while standing on the opposite leg. She finishes with 12 one armed rows using the bench for support, both sides.

I have upped my weights and now lift more than the instructor. She starts with 5s in the out and back move, I am on 7.5; she uses 3s for triceps, I'm on 5s; she uses 8s for bicep and hoist, I use 10; 3s for the rear delt raises, I use 5s; and lastly she has me beat on the rows, using two eights whereas I pick up one 15.

But when I started I tried to use her weights and couldn't complete the second set. So, you get stronger fast. I look forward to the day when I can lift just a bit more then I will stick at that. When I can easily do 24 full length push ups!

Kathy Smith's clear instruction, good visuals, slow, tough moves in this short tape mean I can get there with minimal effort on my own part. I am 41 and a mother of three.

Get this DVD. You won't regret it at all.",1359158400,28,2262,4.117913832199546
5084319,4,B007FZ7PEC,not used it yet but did watch it and I like Kathy Smith so i know it will work if I use it..,1357948800,,92,3.0434782608695654
5084320,5,B007FZ7PEC,"When this workout was first released, I used it all the time. Years went by and I moved on to newer fads and gym workouts, but I always found myself missing this workout. I am thrilled to see that it's been rereleased on dvd.

I don't use this as my primary workout, but it's a perfect strength training addition to any routine. I will do 30 minutes of cardio then a segment or two of this dvd. It's conveniently separated into sections - standing arms, mat arms, legs (lots and lots of squats!), glutes, and abs. Kathy does an excellent job of combining basic free weight exercises with pilates moves, yet still keeping it fast paced enough to eliminate boredom. I'm the first to admit that I hate working out to a dvd, but the pace and the ability to break this workout up into short segments has left me coming back for more. She also explains positioning and modifications for every move, without being too long winded. I always appreciate that.

I definitely recommend this video. Your body will thank you.",1341446400,32,1011,4.549450549450549

5084323,4,B007FZ7PEC,"Love the weights and exercise routines!  Count on Kathy Smith for a great, well balanced workout.  I don't care for ball routines but there is plenty of weights and floor exercise here for anyone to get the variety or style workout they are looking for.",1415491200,,253,4.6

5084326,2,B007FZ7PEC,"There is no challenge for me  at all. I thought it would be short and effective routine, but it turned out to be too easy for me to do. It is for people with no exercise experience at all.",1400716800,,188,3.8205128205128207

8516056,5,B007FZ7PEC,"This is a comprehensive workout that is easily tailored to your fitness level. Kathy Smith also shows you how to perform the exercises with proper form. It says for Beginners, but I would call it Intermediate Beginner. If you are very large and out of shape, this is not the place to start for you.
If you are medium to small size and in relatively decent shape, this is perfect for you! Need free weights 3-15 lbs depending on your fitness level, and a chair. A yoga mat  and block are also useful. to fully utilize the DVD you should have a fitness ball too.",1497312000,,560,4.333333333333333

8516059,4,B007FZ7PEC,Good work out with a nice pace.  Kathy does a good job explaining the different moves and positions.  The only thing I didn't like were the floor exercises.  At 53 years old I don't like to crouch around on the floor and my knees don't hold up too well for some of the moves.  That's why I only gave it 4 points.,1455148800,,312,3.9838709677419355
