6114497,5,B00GUFCPPC,I agree with all the previous reviews except in one area. I wish that the screenwriters had aligned the portrayal of Perez more in line with the book. Deleting  his girlfriend/wife from taking an active part of the story line forces us to miss out on Perez. ability to be a sweet loving man as well as an intrepid copper,1406505600,23,320,4.333333333333333

6114499,5,B00GUFCPPC,"In my constant search for series in this genre, I stumbled across this gem on Amazon UK.  When I saw it was based upon the writing of Ann Cleeves, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera/dp/B0050N0US4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera</a>,) I snapped it up.  While I have never read Cleeves' books her stories as portrayed in these two adaptations really appeal to me.  I love Vera and now I love Shetland.

Shetland, like Vera, is character centric.  In Shetland, our focus is upon the head of CID, Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez, portrayed by Douglas Henshall, (Collision, Primeval,) a widower with custody of his beautiful teenage step-daughter, Cassie.  He moved away from the Islands, where he grew up, but on the death of his wife, he returned to Lerwick, where they met and fell in love.  He feels close to her there and wants Cassie to know the place and people from where her mother came.

Inspector Perez appealed to me as a main character because he's a good man, with a hard job, navigating through an even harder time in his life.  I am a huge fan of crime fighters/sleuths being good people.  Perez is good, as well as smart, shrewd, intuitive, moral, and fair.  As he deals with the survivors and family members of the dead, witnesses, and suspects he does it with kindness, sensitivity, and respect.  He is soft spoken but direct.

Cleeves' deft hand is clearly seen in the main character closely watching people with the ability to look deeply inside of them and see more than they wish to reveal.  Jimmy's interactions with his step-daughter's biological father had me approving of him even more.  Perez is a good dad.  Henshall fills the role perfectly.  His portrayal was spot on with no slippage in character.  He was always believable.

The crew that surrounds and aids Perez are perfectly suited to him.  While his Police Sergeant, Billy McCabe (Lewis Howden) is older and wiser, the other two officers who help him do the legwork involved in murder investigation are young and inexperienced.  Still, what they lack in experience, they more than make up for in enthusiasm and determination. PC Sandy Wilson (Steven Robertson), is dreaming of and studying to become a detective. Sandy displays maturity and emotional fortitude in the face of familial loss. Rounding out the crew is DC Alison ""Tosh"" MacIntosh (Alison O'Donnell).  Her forensic skills and quick mind aid Perez in surprising ways. All three are Shetland Island locals having lived there their entire lives.  They know the land and better yet, they know the people.  This gives them insight and awareness of the goings on and proves, at times, to be invaluable in solving the murders that devastate the small, close-knit community. Unfortunately, and sadly, this means they also know and in some cases, love the victims... and the murderers.

Sandy and Tosh, while young, are sharp and eager to learn the craft of murder solving.  I liked that they were aware and appreciative of Perez's obvious abilities.  Also they respected him, but then he's a man who earns respect.  Formerly a detective in Glasgow, he brings an impressive resume, experience, and skill to Lerwick.  Jimmy Perez is an excellent role model for the aspiring detectives on his team.  I liked how he lead by example.  A visiting forensic officer from the big city of Inverness said to him, ""You know you're wasted here.""  Oh, no he is not!  He's right where he's supposed to be.

The Shetland Islands of Northeast Scotland are stark in their harsh beauty.  I was completely captivated by the windswept land, gray churning ocean, and hovering clouds.  The often gloomy appearing landscape seemed the perfect setting for tragic death by murder.  The locale haunted me and I found myself yearning to go there and experience it for myself.  The Scottish dialect can be difficult to understand but I found it lyrical and charming.  There are subtitles so nothing is lost to our listening ears.

In addition to the beautiful scenery I was struck by the haunting Celtic theme music.  It set the mood of sadness, which accompanies death, perfectly.  In the credits, the only reference to the music was the composer, John Lunn.  I would love to have the soundtrack...if one were available.

There are four episodes, based upon the best-selling books, Red Bones, Raven Black, Dead Water, and Blue Lightning.  Each contain murder, compelling characters, and surprise endings.  I loved pitting my crime solving wits against the culprits' and adding my will to Perez and his team's efforts to find and bring the murderer(s) to justice.

I highly recommend this series.  If you have not yet seen Vera you are missing out.  Recently released in the UK is Vera 4, another masterpiece of murder.

As noted in the product description, this set is Non-USA format and requires a multi-region DVD player and compatible television to play.",1403049600,180,4906,4.988902589395807
6114500,4,B00GUFCPPC,"Beautiful scenery, very good mysteries, but, although I'like it, I find it lacks the charm and feel of Foyle's War.",1519603200,,115,4.8
6114501,4,B00GUFCPPC,"Four very well done police procedural murder mysteries. Many of the locations are not actually in the Shetland's but the film manages to capture the essence of the settings used by Ann Cleeves. I watched the DVD first and would have given it 5 stars,until I read the first 4 books. Translating a novel into film is not easy and I realize things must be cut from a book because of the limitations of the different mediums. The books are excellent-the adaptions, not so much. Raven Black brings the book to life-5 stars. Blue Lightning tells a completely different story,not nearly as well and fans of the book will be disappointed-2 stars. The other two episodes are in between. Jimmy Perez looks nothing like his counterpart in the books. The films remove Fran,Jimmies girl friend/wife who is vital to the stories. Tosh is a total invention and detracts rather than adds. Serious crimes are handled by a team from the mainland and all of those story lines are omitted. There are many more deletions and additions that taken together diminish the world that Ann Cleeves has created. Even after reading the books I still enjoyed the films enough to buy Season 3 which tells a single story. If you are new to Shetland for sure see the films first.",1519516800,,1244,4.684931506849315

6114503,5,B00GUFCPPC,"A little misleading in the description.  There are eight episodes on three disks, but only four stories.  There are two episodes per story, so these are almost movie length.
A caveat for those not devoted to the more remote parts of the UK.  The accent here is melodious, but can be hard to decipher at times; the main lines are clear, so following the story is easy.  Some lines, however, will blow by a casual listening.  I am going to have to watch two or three times, at least, before I get all of the off hand conversations.
The scenery is spectacular, but, unlike Death in Paradise, mostly overcast and stark -- few trees and lots of cliffs.",1517356800,,647,4.4491525423728815

6114505,5,B00GUFCPPC,"I loved this series....right up there with Morse. The mysteries are actually, well, mysterious... and the scenery is gorgeous. I thought it might be severe like Wallander, but they must have filmed on all the sunny days! I cant wait to see Season 3. Please note that this contains 8 episodes, not 8 separate mysteries.

6114508,5,B00GUFCPPC,Great series,1506902400,,12,5.5
6114509,5,B00GUFCPPC,"This is a wonderful series ...I'm watching S1 & S2 again for the 2nd time in less than a month. The writing is great, so is the acting, from Douglas Henshall on down. The characters are 3-D & interesting, not from stock. The stories do share some similarities...there's a murder (maybe 2) in a small place that's fairly isolated, in one part or other of the Shetland Isles. There's several potential suspects. The stories & mysteries are the kind that seem like what could happen in any small town, village, or big city, for that matter; the types of things that happen to real people, as opposed to dramatic, wild, over-the-top happenin's. Not as cozy as a drawing room mystery, but easy to relate to.

Which is not to say they're boring. I really grew to care about the characters, & when bad thing(s) happened to one (or more)* of the
regulars, it really moved me.

The islands play a big part in the series; as at least one other reviewer observed, the land & sea are pretty much main characters as
well as the people. Beautifully filmed in a gorgeous (if minimalist) land, the scenery makes me want to go there to get in touch with my own
Scottish roots.

Lovely series; I hope the Beeb has more sense than most of US TV decision-makers & keeps it up (this show wouldn't have lasted a full
season on a US channel...too intelligent & classy).

It occurred to me mid-way thru the second run-thru that part of what I like about the characters is that the actors look like real people, rather than the plastic Barbie/Ken people that we get on US TV shows; older characters may have belly bulges or wrinkles. Most look as if they've never been near a Botox needle. There's very attractive people, and some very unattractive people, & in-between people. Realistic people. What a concept!

Though, one silly nit-pick: why does the GP who does the forensic work for the Shetland police always shake down her electronic thermometer?

Physically, is quite different from the book's description, but it takes only a few minutes for Douglas Henshall's Jimmy to become The Jimmy.

6114529,5,B00GUFCPPC,"Very pleased to have discovered this series! Wonderfully acted, intelligent writing, sweeping views of stark landscapes and overcast skies which add to the mood of the story. Douglas Henshall as protagonist Jimmy Perez is just wonderful, I haven't seen him in any other shows/movies but he's convincing, understated, and engaging. In fact I don't recognize many of the actors (the two exceptions: Nina Sosanya from Last Tango In Halifax, and Mark Bonnar from Catastrophe) but there isn't a weak link in the bunch.

Each mystery comprises two hour-long episodes. The stories are sufficiently complex that you won't guess the endings. The main characters are fleshed out just enough with details of their personal lives, you feel as if you know the characters, but their stories don't get in the way of the plot.

I have to admit that I watched the first few episodes with subtitles on, the accents took some getting used to for my American ears, and I was missing bits of the conversations.

Highly recommend this series, especially if you are a fan of Happy Valley, Luther, or Broadchurch.",1493164800,2,1089,4.972527472527473

6114533,4,B00GUFCPPC,"Youve heard of Shetland ponies and sheep dogs now comes a Shetland BBC Scotland TV series.

Once again, the BBC takes me on a trip to places Ill never visit but find hauntingly beautiful under cold gray skies in the way-up-northern hemisphere. Oh, how I wish I could live there where the madness of the world slips away to a sleepy village with a few murders sprinkled here and there among the back-road and coastal communities.

Shetland is another fine BBC who-done-it drama.  Once you get used to those heavy Scottish accents, the first two episodes will pull you into another world.  Of course, I run off and must Google everything, to see it on the map and read about the history, but I won't bore you here on an entertainment review blog.  To my disappointment, the series is filmed in mainland Scotland that is somewhat like the Shetland Islands, and only a few scenes have included Lerick. Be prepared to watch the ferry cross the waters back and forth between island locations.

Nevertheless, the first two episodes is an intriguing story of a murdered elderly lady, who had a love affair in her youth with the Norwegian leader of the Shetland Bus. Youll have to tune in to figure out what that period of World War II was all about.

In addition to that tidbit, the first two episodes also give you the experience of watching the Up Helly Aa fire festival of marching men in Roman outfits and a Viking long ship being burned by torches.  Its worth watching just to see the last few scenes of torches being tossed on the ship and flames flying everywhere.

Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez (tune into the third episode to find out why he has a Spanish surname), played by Douglas Henshall, is the inspector traveling back and forth on a ferry with his rugged SUV to travel the highways in the middle of nowhere.  Much like series Vera or Hinterland, he traipses about the barren landscape, solving murders among the community.  Apparently, the series is based on novels by Ann Cleeves (not to be confused with Anne of Cleves, the fourth wife of Henry VIII  just thought Id throw that out there).  Douglas Henshall apparently won the best actor BAFTA award for 2016.

The series started in 2013 and is scheduled for more episodes to be released in 2017.  If you're looking for another British mystery crime show, I highly recommend Shetland to add to your binge list.  I haven't seen any Shetland ponies or dogs yet, but heres hoping.",1492300800,,2440,4.6395348837209305
6114534,4,B00GUFCPPC,overall a well done series though i think part of the attraction was simply shetland and childhood memories--  a bit disappointing emotionally but part of that is the scottish temperament and abrupt changes seemingly to keep audience offkilter not because they were at all plausible or in keeping with a character  ..,1491523200,,317,5.076923076923077

Sympathetic characters who care for each other. These islands today have only 27,000 inhabitants. Locations are separated by water, using ferries and airplanes to get around. Driving for long stretches between homes. The scenery really sets the mood for the mysteries.",1475539200,,441,5.054794520547945

The so-called cast is populated with untalented, unappealing and amateurish actors that I cannot imagine bias toward actuality or authenticity in this remot, idyllic if harsh, community.  The plot and overall design are lame, and if we grudgingly accept that this unpleasant little man is the legislator, enforcer and judge of lives, where unexpectedly the public sphere trammell the private (you'd think upon these wild rocks cropping out of a freezing sea individual freedom would enjoy a margin of liberty), it is just boring to see the symbolic order order reduced to a parking ticketing and breathalyzing  minion who unpleasantly interferes in everyone's private life in spreading his own very unpleasant iota of civil service, sharing his utopia vision of greater good.  Truly a solid disappointment, but also one that I waited for with eager anticipation. If there is any merit here - and I am one who revels in local culture and also regional custom and dialect - then somehow I simply and completely missed it.",1473724800,,1035,5.076470588235294

6114599,2,B00GUFCPPC,"The series deviates too much from the books. The stories and characters are unrecognizable. One very obvious example is the main character's physical appearance. According to the books, Jimmy Perez is of Spanish descent. Ann Cleeves describes him as NOT looking anglo. The choice of an anglo, very fair-haired/ fair skinned actor is very disappointing (& bigoted?).",1473379200,,365,5.421052631578948

But I love Shetland!  Yes it is not fast paced, but I like that about it, it takes you through the thought processes of the detective. Douglas Henshall is engaging as Det Perez and the location cannot be beat. It reminds me in some ways of Midsomer Murder but has its own feel of course.

6114627,1,B00GUFCPPC,"I love the books and was looking forward to this coming to TV, especially as the Vera series is so well done.  It was a huge disappointment.
Mostly the characters are either missing or just plain wrong for their book counterpart.  Perez is supposed to be of Spanish descent and its quite a big deal in the books that he has dark hair and such.  He's also unassuming and non-confrontational, both of which the actor clearly isn't.
I liked the actor, he's just not what I wanted to see playing the role.
The 'Tosh' character was what pushed all my hate-this-series-not-going-to-watch-ever button; she was completely pointless and annoying.

I didn't finish it and will not be watching any more series.",1468368000,,699,4.8

6114637,5,B00GUFCPPC,"Melancholy and moody series of who done its with complex plots. Somewhat like Tom Selleck's Jessie Stone of Paradise Mass. However some of Stone's plots evolve around Stone knowing who did the murder but unable to prove they did it which doesn't happen here. Only at the end of the plots do we know who is responsible. In this series the violence and horror are far less overt then Stone's series but the tension is always there anyway.

6114644,3,B00GUFCPPC,"Shetland is very average with slow action and little drama.  To make up for this they use overly dissonant and very loud background music that often drowns out the voices of the actors.  The heavy Scottish accent is difficult enough to understand without having it over powered by loud disjointed sound effects.  They also use way too much jerky quick flash scenes in an attempt to add some action to the stories.

The acting varies from solid to poor and dialogue is often given very stiltedly.  The logic and assumptions leave something to be desired as there are illogical jumps to conclusions.

All in all 3 stars is all it is worth and I will not be baying season 3.",1464825600,,671,4.55

6114647,5,B00GUFCPPC,"The three DVD set of SHETLAND seasons 1 and 2 is both entertaining and impressive.  Some viewers here in the USA may be frustrated attempting to understand the Scottish accent (brogue) in which the players deliver their lines and the strange to us terms they sometimes employ.  Personally, I enjoy both the accent and the challenge.  Aside from dialogue and terminology, the setting for the shows exterior footage is verifiably the Shetlands, and it is well worth seeing.  Finally, and definitely not an afterthought, both the stories and the cast are up to par.  Seasons 1 and 2 are advertised on the Amazon website and on the DVD keepcase insert as consisting of 8 mysteries.  NOT TRUE.  What you're really getting is 4 mysteries, each of which is presented in two episodes.  So, 8 episodes equaling 4 mysteries.  However, don't let that misleading advertising put you off.

6114649,3,B00GUFCPPC,"I know that it would be impossible to do a show exactly like the books, but couldn't they have tried to keep the basics?  Although Doug Henshall is a good actor, couldn't they find a Scots actor who at least resembled the character in the books?  Why have his dead love be his wife instead of his fiancee?  Why make her daughter be in her late teens rather than the much younger child?  If I remember the book correctly, the first episode was the case in which Perez actually meets the woman who becomes his fiancee and her small daughter.  Would it not have been better for the series to develop as the books do?  So many details that didn't have to be changed.
That being said, it isn't a  bad  mystery series, and the scenery is great. If I hadn't read all of the books I probably would h ave given it four stars.  I wish there were more episodes for the price",1464220800,4,863,4.213414634146342

So many times the movies are so far from the books that you barely recognize them but not so with this series.  It's so great to see the characters come to life even if they may be slightly or even greatly different than you pictured them in your mind.  I would never have cast Douglas Henshall as Jimmy Perez but being the great actor he is he pulled the role off very well. The Shetland Island scenery alone was worth the price of the purchase.

6114668,4,B00GUFCPPC,"Shetland is a contemporary mystery series made for BBC Scotland beginning in 2013, based on Anne Cleves novels that take place on the Scottish islands of Shetland. The protagonist is Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez, whose surname is explained by a Spanish ancestor who shipwrecked on Shetland. Season 1 consists of the Red Bones pilot only. Season 2 includes three mysteries: Raven Black, Dead Water, and Blue Lightning. Each mystery is 1 hour 45 minutes long and was originally shown in two parts. I have not read the books, but I understand that the sidekick character of DS Alison Tosh MacIntosh is not in the books, and Perez teenaged daughter Cassie is younger in the books. The mysteries were filmed in Scotland, though not entirely on Shetland. They are self-consciously atmospheric, to the extent that the audience feels the damp chill.

Douglas Henshall is an unlikely Jimmy Perez, being a strawberry blonde. Unlike in the books, he looks quite Saxon and fits right in, reputedly taking after his mothers side of the family. I like Henshall, but this odd casting choice had me wondering why the detective was named Perez for the entire first episode. I don't know how closely the plots follow the books, but the mysteries are intricate and don't seem to be pushing a political agenda, which is a rarity in British fare these days. The additions of Tosh and Cassie are unfortunate, however. The plainspoken working-class sidekick is a clich, and Tosh is especially annoying. The widower with overprotected teenage daughter is also a clich that adds nothing but sentimentality and contrived anxiety to the proceedings. The plots are a little careless and have holes, but Henshall and Scotland are charismatic.

The episodes are:

Red Bones (2013) begins with the murder of elderly Mima Wilson (Sandra Voe) just outside her home. He body is found the next day by her grandson, PC Sandy Wilson (Steven Robertson). DI Perez (Douglas Henshall) and DS MacIntosh (Alison ODonnell) interview Mimas son Joseph Wilson (Alexander Morton) and the other, wealthier side of the family, the Haldanes, who made their fortune by having the biggest fishing boats. Locals assume that Mimas alcoholic grandson Ronald Haldane (Jim Sturgeon) shot her accidentally. But Joseph, who inherits from Mima, wanted her to sell the croft to developers. He also puts a stop to an archeological dig that was on the property, under the directorship of Swedish academic Paul Berglund (Martin Wenner). One can only guess why a Chinese actress was cast as a Scottish archeologist named Hattie James.

Raven Black (2014) opens with the body of 17-year-old Catherine Ross (Sophia Carr-Gomm), strangled with her own scarf where she lie on the beach. Catherine was an independent young woman, a bit of a provocateur, who lived alone while her father worked on an oil rig and attended local high school. She was at a party on the main island that night before her death, but CCTV lost track of her after she caught a bus. As Perez works his way through Catherines friend Sally Henry (Rebecca Benson), the mousy daughter of an unpopular local teacher, her teachers, and acquaintances, word gets out that 7-year-old Catriona Bruce disappeared from the same home 19 years before. The locals want to blame reclusive old Magnus Bain (Brian Cox), who lives nearby.

Dead Water (2014) finds an old fried of DI Perez, journalist Jerry Markham, dead in a car accident, having plunged off a cliff. Evidence points to a hit and run, so an investigation ensues. Markham was originally from Shetland but was based in London at the time of this death. He had returned to the islands to see a former flame, Evie Watt (Kari Corbett), with whom hed had a scandalous and painful breakup many years before, leaving the Markham and Watt families feuding, and to investigate plans by Storne Gas to install an oil pipeline under the loch, for which they needed land owned by a crusty old fisherman named Joe Dalhousie (David Hayman), who steadfastly refused to sell. Crime scene investigator Willow Reeves (Nina Sosanya), flown in from Aberdeen, confirms suspicions of murder. Between the commercial and personal motives, there are plenty of suspects.

Blue Lightning (2014) takes DI Perez back to his roots on Fair Isle, total population 70 people, where his parents still live. A group of biologists based at a research center on Fair Isle have made the islands bird population famous, chief among them Dr. Anna Blake, who resides on the island with husband Frank (John Lynch) and teenaged son Joe (Keith Ramsey). Anna is murdered while working in her lab one night after a party. Her relationship with her cagey student Peter Latimer (Anthony Howell) is unclear, and he was supposed to be in the lab at the time Blake died. Another biologist at the lab, Finlay Caulfield (David Ireland) is hiding evidence. DI Perez visits childhood friends, and DS MacIntosh sets up a makeshift office on the island, while a storm prevents anyone leaving by air, and the population grows restless knowing there is a murderer among them.",1461283200,,5068,4.970518867924528

6114703,5,B00GUFCPPC,Douglas Henshall is completely believable as Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez. I like the dynamic and struggle to balance his job with his daughter and the complexities presented by the non-traditional family involving his daughter's biological father. Its interesting and is definitely emblematic of the complexities presented by our modern life. It seems that even in far off Shetland one cannot avoid these issues.,1453161600,2,416,5.619047619047619
6114704,5,B00GUFCPPC,"""Shetland"" is a really nicely done BBC police procedural set in the remote and beautiful Shetland Islands north of mainland Scotland.  This DVD contains the first two seasons, a total of four two-part mysteries to be solved by DCI Jimmy Perez and his principal assistants, Sergeant ""Tosh"" MacIntosh and Constable Sandy Wilson.  The series features characters with depth, a hauntingly beautiful landscape, and intricate mysteries that will leave the viewer hanging on every word (and not just for the sometimes challenging local accents).

The episodes follow a steady formula: a murder, an extended investigation that features lots of suspects, and a surprising resolution of the crime.  Perez and his partners are from the islands; local customs and relationships are a factor to be considered in each investigation.  Forensics are a featured part of the process, but the stories are largely driven by interaction with the citizens of the Shetlands.  Perez himself is an excellent lead, honest and direct, but with a complicated life as a widower raising a teenage stepdaughter.  There is an interesting supporting cast of recurring characters, including a local doctor who doubles as a coroner, and Perez's sometimes difficult boss.  The suspense is quite good; it would be tough not to watch each mystery straight through.  Very highly recommended as excellent entertainment.",1451088000,3,1378,5.372093023255814

Great acting, the scenery is amazing.  We hadn't before seen the Shetland Islands, although we've been all over Scotland.  The accents are a little tricky to understand at first, until you get used to them, so sub-titles really help.  ""Shetland"" makes a nice change from the typical London or Manchester police procedurals.  Superb writing, beautifully unusual scenery, good setting, which is an important part of the plots, it's like being in another world.  The series is strong on mood, tone, and there are various themes going on.  Absolutely brilliant Scottish actors.  It's very absorbing, retains your interest until the last surprise ending.

Was delighted that this series isn't as broodingly atmospheric as Broadchurch or Hinterland or as monotone as Vera.  Douglas Henshall (Collision) led a good cast; one episode also starred David Hayman (Trial and Retribution) and Alex Norton (Taggart.)  Beautiful scenery and thick Scottish accents; there are subtitles and a 'play all' option.  Wish there were more to come.,1438560000,2,440,5.426470588235294
6114714,4,B00GUFCPPC,"Shetland is one of those new television shows that seems to catch you unaware. I am a person who loves BBC Detective Series, and have since moved on to the Norwegian and Danish mystery series. This series takes place in Shetland, an artic archipelago off the Scotland coast. I am very good with accents, but the heavy accents in this series had me using the subtitle category.

We meet Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez, played by Douglas Henshall, a man who has recently lost his wife to cancer. He is bringing up their teenage daughter, and at the same time trying to solve all the crimes inherent in a community. And, this community has murder on its mind in this series. This series is from the books written by Ann Cleves, the same author of the 'Vera' books and series.

The Shetland Iseles are isolating, windy, all face the ocean. The inhabitants all work very hard, many are farmers, or work in the small towns of the isles. Religion seems to be a big part of their lives, marriage, birth and death. Whenever, DI Perez needs a pathologist he needs to call someone from one of the cities closest to the Isles. He pretty much has to solve all of the cases on his own with the assistance of two well informed and competent assistants. He counts on the townspeople to assist his investigations, and since he is fairly well known and liked, he can count on someone coming forward. DI Perez solves his cases in the usual hour or it often becomes a two parter episode. This is a well written and acted series. And I saw the first episode on PBS.  This is a good series to follow.

6114717,5,B00GUFCPPC,"This is a murder mystery series based on the Ann Cleeves books.  The show is set in the Shetland Islands and much of the video is exterior locations in Shetland Islands and Scotland.  The video and scenery are beautiful.  Some British murder mystery like Midsomer Murders are light hearted but this series is more of a realistic police procedural. Portions of the plot are dark but not real dark; nothing in poor taste is shown or dwelt on.  Much of the show is about everyday relationships between the characters.  The pace sometimes seems slow but it is always progressing and the pace acts to pull me in.  In this summer heat I love the beautifully shot video of the cool, northern locations.

6114720,5,B00GUFCPPC,"Jimmy Perez (pronounced PEAR ehz) is a DCI out of Lerwick, the largest town on Mainland, the largest of the Shetland Islands. His wife, Fran, died of cancer, leaving him to raise Cassie, his teen-age stepdaughter, on his own. Or he was on his own, until Duncan, her real father, turns up to get reacquainted with the daughter he abandoned 10 years before. They are trying to make it as civilized as possible. As Duncan explains, Im her father. Jimmys her Dad.

In episode 3, a character notes that Perez isn't a Shetland name. Perez replies, They say they came over with a shipwreck from the Armada, and a Spanish sailor fell in love with a girl from Fair Isle.

Jimmy is assisted by Detective Constable Sandy Wilson and Detective Sergeant Alison Tosh MacIntosh. Tosh is an excellent example of not judging a book by its cover. Her eyebrows are permanently slanted as if shes worried. Together with her plump cheeks and sloping shoulders, you could get the mistaken impression that theres not much going on in her head.

All of these mysteries have convoluted plotting with multiple story threads - never boring! And the islands are like a character. Gorgeous, green and gray and stark. Even at Midsummer, you have to wear a parka at night. I've attached a map of the Shetland Islands, showing Lerwick, the largest city (where DCI Perez is based). It doesn't show Fair Isle, unfortunately, because that little isle is way south of Mainland, half way to the Orkneys, So I added a photo of little Fair Isle itself. Known for its wool and traditional knitting patterns, it is only 3 miles square - which still makes it the 10th largest of the Shetland Islands.

Shetland is produced by BBC Scotland. Season 1 first aired in March, 2013, consisting of the 2-part episode Red Bones. Season 2, with three 2-part mysteries, aired March/April 2014. Each episode is about 57 minutes without commercials. They started filming Season 3 in 2015. It will be one murder mystery told in 6 episodes.

Most of the filming is done on mainland Scotland, with an occasional foray onto Mainland, Shetland. Even so, the scenery is breathtaking. It must be annoying, though, to live on one of the Shetlands, and see another place represent your own beautiful island.

Episodes 1 & 2: Red Bones On the Eastern island of Bressay, the elderly Mima Wilson muses over a yellowed photograph of 3 young fishermen standing in front of a boat. She hears a noise outside her isolated croft and heads out to check, calling Whos there? Is that you?
The next morning, young DC Sandy Wilson, Mimas grandson, stops in to check on her, only to find her outside, dead from a shotgun blast. DCI Perez takes the 20-minute ferry from Lerwick to investigate. There are family antagonisms going back 70 years to bear on the case, not to mention an archeological dig on Mimas land which just turned up a skull. How old is that skull?
To make it worse, Perez has to investigate the murder while dealing with the tourist influx to celebrate the annual Up Helly Aa festival, always a time for people to overimbibe  or to get lost in the crowd.
I've attached a photo from a real Up Helly Aa with Jarl Squad (Vikings) bearing lit torches through the night, culminating in burning a long-boat on the sea.

Episodes 3 & 4: Raven BlackIts Midsummer midnight, and Sally Henry, the teachers daughter, and Catherine Ross, local teen-with-an-attitude, are drinking at a beach bonfire. On the way home to their village of Ravenswick, Sally tells Catherine that her mother does not like me when Im with you. She does not like you.
They pass the croft of Magnus Bain, and Catherine insists on stopping for a visit. Magnus, a natural recluse, shy of contact, still not over his sisters death 50 years before. He's a natural target. Id write Poor Magnus, but he would not welcome that or even understand. Hell get the worst of it after 17 year-old Catherine is found dead on the beach the next morning, strangled with her own scarf. She had peoples secrets, and it cost her.

Episodes 5 & 6: Blue LightningPerez is from Fair Isle, and Cassie is visiting his folks on that small island. One of Fair Isles international claims to fame is its bird observatory and research center. It has three permanent employees, Ann and Frank Blake, and Annas assistant, Finlay Caulfield. Other students, researchers and birders come and go.
Back in Lerwick, Perez is woken by a late night phone call from his Dad. Anna Blake has been killed in her laboratory and Jimmy goes home to solve a murder. As his father tells Jimmy, There hasn't been an unlawful killing in Fair Isle for 70 years and even that was caused by the Luftwaffe.

Episodes 7 & 8: Dead WaterA wedding is coming to the village of Skellwick. Jerry Markham, an old journalist friend of Jimmy and Frans, makes a surprise visit from London. And Storne Gas wants to build a new pipeline right across a fish farm. These threads come together in a complicated murder investigation that starts after Jerrys sports car is pushed over a cliff. As Jerrys grieving parents tell Jimmy: He had set up this investigative website. We worried about him when he was in London. But not here.

In the DVD set for the combined Seasons 1 & 2, you get 454 minutes of atmospheric mysteries. They are presented in 16:9 anamorphic and stereo. English subtitles are available for all episodes. The DVD set has no bonus features.

Shetland and the characters in it are taken from the mystery novels by Ann Cleeves. Shes written six of them, so far. Cleeves is also the author of the Vera Stanhope mystery series, which have been filmed by ITV as the murder mystery series Vera. I haven't read any of her mysteries, yet, but now Im going to have to, to see how well she describes the stark beauty of the Shetland Islands, if nothing else. Here's the latest ""Vera"" available on DVD/BluRay:

I love learning new trivia from a show. I had to re-watch Shetland with subtitles to catch the spelling of some of the old Gaelic words sprinkling the conversations. For example, Ceilidh, pronounced KAY lee, means a social gathering. Glaikit = foolish-looking. The Shetland Bus (episodes 1 & 2) was a very real clandestine special op during WWII. And, last but not least, the El Gran Grifn, flagship of the Spanish Armada, really was shipwrecked with 300 sailors on Shetland in 1588.

A Very Recommended Mystery Series.

6114721,5,B00GUFCPPC,"There are only (sadly) four stories to date in these two seasons.  ""Seasons"" seems to stretch the definition but the nearly two hour each films are extremely well done making viewers edgy wanting even more.
I love the setting and wouldn't mind at all selling everything I have to move there for the rest of my days.
The characters are sharply drawn and the mysteries are not easy to solve.  They present a challenge to the viewer which is what all detective fans want.  Five stars easily for this show.",1429401600,,502,4.555555555555555

6114723,5,B00GUFCPPC,I enjoyed the series immensely and found the mysteries very compelling. NOTE: heavy Scottish accent!! If you have trouble understanding the accent you will not enjoy it; which was the case with my wife.,1428796800,,202,4.970588235294118
6114724,5,B00GUFCPPC,"Based on novels by Ann Cleeves, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera/dp/B004MW57BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera</a>], this series is not to be missed.

No, his name does not sound Scottish, which is explained in one of the stories (old Spanish shipwrecks). The music and cinematography are breathtakingly beautiful. Sidekicks Alison O'Donnell (Detective Constable/Detective Sergeant Alison 'Tosh' MacIntosh) and Steven Robertson (Police Constable/Detective Constable Sandy Wilson) are good.

Red Bones
Alone in her croft, elderly Mima Wilson is murdered. This brings out family strife dating back to WWII, as well as complications with an archaeological dig on her property. Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez balances being the widowed father of a teenager, whose real father was his dead wife's ex. DI Perez can't shut down the traditional fire festival Up Helly Aa, while further murder ensues. The great Alexander Morton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monarch-of-the-Glen/dp/B004EYT8BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monarch of the Glen</a>) does a memorable turn as Mima's son, Joseph Wilson.

Raven Black
On Midsummer night, the light lingers in the Shetlands. After visiting recluse Magnus Bain (Brian Cox is wonderful), a lonely, troubled young girl is murdered. Bain's croft overlooks the beach where she is found, and locals believe he is responsible. They also suspect him of being involved with the unsolved disappearance 19 years previously of young Catriona. The two victims lived in the same house. An absorbing, excellent mystery.

Dead Water
This episode has a great cast: Kari Corbett (also of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monarch-of-the-Glen/dp/B004EYT8BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monarch of the Glen</a>) in a star performance as beleaguered bride-to-be Evie Watt, the superb Clive Russell (also a guest on Monarch, and ""Blackfish"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones-Season-2/dp/B0060MYM3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones: Season 2</a>, and David Hayman as Joe Dalhousie. An old journalist friend of Perez's wife dies in a suspicious car wreck. Along with Evie, he was questioning the environmental impact of a controversial new gas pipeline. Beautiful scenes with Dalhousie out on his boat, listening to the clouds and water... Unfortunately, there are indeed some slow scenes that could have used some editing, namely, the long, dark, repetitive sequence in the missing bridegroom's home. But overall, a good mystery indeed.

Blue Lightening
Cleves' real life husband is an ornithologist, no wonder birds frequently feature in ""Vera"" and ""Shetland."" Perez must return his childhood Shetland home, Fair Isle, to investigate the murder of a lead female ornithologist. Storms isolate the island, while his father tries to help, while Perez copes without a forensic team. The victim's husband (John Lynch, also great in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-of-Roan-Inish/dp/B00004TJKJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret of Roan Inish</a>) is a suspect, so is an obsessive coworker, and a former flame. Perez finds that the victim's son and his friend's son may also be hiding something. The team needs to obtain a consistent dog, and please watch the sky with edits (stormy to sunny too quickly).

The good news is that filming for a third series will begin in 2015, with a single-story arc told in six episodes.",1426550400,5,3984,6.896825396825397

6114727,5,B00GUFCPPC,"I just finished watching series 1-2.  I loved the series!!!!!! This is one of the best detective series on television right now. It's what a detective series should be: suspenseful, interesting characters, intelligent dialogue, clever plots, and a wonderful setting for a murder. The setting is in the Shetland Islands. You get the feeling it's a place that father time forgot. The landscape is absolutely beautiful, you can't stop staring at the scenes with the green green grass and blue blue water. The music they play in the background really fits with the beauty and magic of the land. The lead detective Jimmy Perez is someone you like immediately. He is an honest, thoughtful, and intelligent person. He draws you in with his presence.  Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez (Douglas Henshall) has to be a real self-sufficient detective and think on his feet  because of the isolation of the land and the weather of the sea. The series is adapted  from the novels of Ann Cleeves. I like her settings and stories. She also created the detective series Vera but I like this detective series better.",1424304000,3,1097,4.9135135135135135

6114734,5,B00GUFCPPC,"Superbly done series of four, 2-hour murder mysteries.  Beautifully filmed in the Shetland islands, the series profiles many of the local habits, festivals, scenery, places, personalities, language, and foibles of the remote island chain.  Characters are well developed and the story lines believable.  Acting is superb, and even across just four shows, they develop their characters nicely.  Very similar in pacing and style to the Vera series, minus the passive-aggressive bantering that defines that show.  The connection is logical, given that they are based on different series from the same author.  Excellent show!",1418515200,44,621,5.623655913978495
