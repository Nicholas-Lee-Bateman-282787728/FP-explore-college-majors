1844725,5,B00008G8Q7,"well,i didn't buy this boxed set but i have the single dvd.and the reason i got just the dvd is because the ""shirt"" it came with was XL! how am i supposed to wear an XL shirt!? anyway,this is my favorite anime and i've seen most of it anyway by fansubbing,i saw it the way it was meant to be seen! when i found out it had been lisensed and was coming out in the US i was anxous to see what they whould do with it!
and its just fine except the voice they gave Sousuke has too much personality! he is supposed to be somewhat emotionally handicapped! anyway, if you get it watch it both ways and judge for yourself! my conclusion? best anime;better subbed! the artwork is beautiful clean and sharp!",1055808000,,695,4.1940298507462686
1844726,5,B00008G8Q7,"Welcome to a world were the Cold War never ended. Cruel experiments are conducted on human beings, soldiers working for an autonomous agency known as Mithril guard the peace, and a high-spirited high-school girl may hold the key to world peace, or world destruction.
Chidori doesn't know it, but genetically imprinted in her is vast amounts of dangerous information for super technology. Unfortunately for her, the KGB does know, and they want her.
Enter the shining knights of Mithril, dedicated to protecting the peace of the world and stopping any threats before they start. One of their agents, Sosuke Sagara, is assigned as Chidori's twenty-four hour body-guard, and he takes this job seriously.
Too bad that Chidori thinks that Sosuke is a pervert stalking her through the halls of her high school. Too bad the teacher at the high school thinks that Sosuke is a delinquent out to make trouble. Too bad that Chidori and 400 other people have just been kidnapped by the KGB's most ruthless mercenary.
This is some of the finest animation I've ever seen, with vivid colors, and smooth motion. And the series not only looks good, it's got the ability to go from comedic to dramatic without any sort of stumbling or hitches. While we laugh at Sosuke's plight as an undercover high-school student, we also cling to the edge of our seats as we watch the cruelty of their arch foe. Graphic violence, including gunshot wounds, blood, and some harsh physical violence.",1055635200,6,1464,4.907258064516129
1844727,5,B00008G8Q7,"I have watched the entire series already from fan subbing.  Was a wonderful series, and was just waiting for it to come on out DVD, which it finally has.  The english voices are good (expecially who does the captains voice who I have always liked).  It has everything that I like about an anime series, and is a must view in my opinion.",1055376000,2,336,4.301587301587301
1844728,5,B00008G8Q7,"full metal panic has it all, fighting, machines, mystery, comedy, and of course love intrests. I got into this series by reading it in newtype magazine, however, in my opinion the series is better in anime form the in manga. it has something for everybody and i can't wait til the next set of episodes come out! a definite must buy!",1055203200,,332,4.459016393442623
1844729,3,B00008G8Q7,"Okay, I've only seen the first episode from NewType but that alone makes me wanna see the series.  It looks amusing between the two main characters, and Soske(I know, sp) being so rigid and linear it'll be a great show, can't wait to get it!",1054944000,,241,4.355555555555555
1844730,5,B00008G8Q7,"Hey!
Just got this DVD (i dunno how Knights of Anime had is early but whatever). I first saw this series in Jap w/ subs, and I thought that the series itself was a great series, full of action, comedy and some [great] animation due to GONZO studios. The english job is pretty good so far, but I haven't seen the english actors fully get into thier characters yet, but we will see later in the series but Anyways, go out and get this dvd, part of a great series",1054684800,2,460,4.122222222222222
1844814,3,B00008G8Q7,"This was a let-down. I had been looking forward to seeing this series, but when I finally watched it...well, my mind wandered. There was absolutely nothing there to grab my attention but the artwork, and even that wasn't enough. The characters don't have any chemistry together, especially the 'couple' Kaname and Sousuke. The boy continually makes a fool of himself by dashing into situations with guns blazing, shouting at the top of his lungs. Kaname is cynical and impatient, without even the hint of a sense of humor. Her friend doesn't get enough screentime to give us any real idea of how she and Kaname interact, and Sousuke's partners are nothing new. His superior is a woman devoted to her work with the military, and comes off as rather butch. His 'best friend' is the only one in the show with any sense of what is funny, but even his jokes are tainted with the old and boring. He is the only one who notices Kaname as a girl, but once he finds out about her temper he loses interest.
Although the animation is nice, that is not enough. Frankly, I think giving this dvd 3 stars is being generous. I regret buying this dvd [...].",1080086400,2,1140,4.538834951456311
1844815,5,B00008G8Q7,"Watch at your own risk.  By the time you're done with these four you're going to be out the cost of a few more DVDs because you most likely won't be able to wait to see what happens next.
Full Metal Panio (FMP) has a bit of everything.  Action, Adventure, Quiet moments,, comedy, and the obligatory underlying love story.  Its the total package highlighted by great animation, plot and characters.  The first four episodes do a great job of introducing you to series and getting you hooked.  It'll leave you with a cliff hanger ending so I highly recommend you get disk two as well unless you like torturing yourself.
The only bad thing is the cheesy english dubbing.  If you really want watch in 5.1 sound then you'll need to put up with it but imo its just so much better in japanese with subs (as most animes are).  I suspect you'll just switch to japanese after you here Souske say ""Miss Chidori"" the first time.  This is definitely a must buy for anime fans.",1079222400,,963,4.431818181818182
1844816,3,B00008G8Q7,"When I first heard about Full Metal Panic I was confused.  Was it a giant robot fighting show or a high school love comedy?  After watching the first DVD, with the first four episodes, I have to say it is neither - yet.  One battle between a 'Arm Slave' - think battle mech - vs a Hind attack helicopter does not a mecha series make.  And there seems to be very little going on in the way of a relationship between Sousuke and Kaname Chidori, the special girl, he has to protect.
Yet, it did hook me, barely, so I plan to get the second DVD.  Because it has some humor, good artwork, interesting weapons and lots of questions it needs to answer.  This DVD is for 15 and up, and I suggest getting it used or renting it.
I warn you, if the second DVD is not better, I won't be bothering with a review.",1079049600,,799,4.089743589743589
1844817,5,B00008G8Q7,"Believe me when I say that if I could give a review of 6 stars, I would for FMP. I wasn't really into very many series of anime, and to tell the truth, I randomly picked this series up without knowing a thing about it. The four episodes on this dvd will let you feel just how the story twists and turns. Not knowing anything about the series, I popped the dvd in and started episode one. It left me with a feeling of wanting more, sort of this, ""This story could be good if they take it in the right direction"" type of feeling. Episode by episode, it just kept getting better until the fourth episode left you with a cliffhangar so big, I didn't just want to see Mission 2. I NEEDED TO SEE MISSION 2!!! (Which reminds me, when you buy mission one, I suggest you also buy mission 2, or else you will be stuck with the hunger for more.) The graphics are stunning  in every aspect. CGI blends in beautifully with the graphics. Sound is great, and the music will intensify the feeling ten fold. Character development happens all at different times, which makes the story that more interesting. Sure, I want good graphics/sound/ect. However, the thing that I want the most is a good story, and FMP gives me a story like no other. This series is a masterpiece!",1073952000,5,1254,4.336170212765958
1844818,5,B00008G8Q7,"At first, the title for this anime seems a bit silly. Well, please believe me when I say that the series is the opposite of that. The series combines amazing action with a solid plot. Lemme break this down for yah:
Animation: Top quality is a phrase, I feel, best sums up this section. It's perfect in every form. It really brings the action scenes to life.
Sub/Dub: Honestly, I am a dub guy, but the subs are great. The dubbing, however, is amazing. This title offers a giant leap in the quality of voice acting.
Plot: The plot swings back and forth from serious to slap stick through out the many episodes I have seen. I find the underlying subplots really balance well with the romantic notes that start to appear as you progress through this series.
Sound/Music: I love the music score from this. It, like the rest of the qualities, is quite proffesional. The music doesn't inhibit the scenes at all. Sound quality is amazing as well. Combat really comes to life with it.
Overall: A definate keeper and series for the ages. Only draw back is that sometimes things take a full volume to escalate. With a second season coming soon, it is worth the hard earned money.",1069804800,5,1168,4.514150943396227
1844819,5,B00008G8Q7,"Jay, finaly a TV series that makes use of 5.1  You might love or hate the series but the sound makes it worth. In the very first scenes there is a short Mecha vs Hind chopper fight. Man,
I thought it flew trough my room. Usualy anime TV series are stereo and sometimes Sorround but this one has full 5.1 chanels. I saw the whole series and the later Mech fights get loud, so enjoy it if you have the right equipment if not its a good idea to get one ;-)",1068076800,,453,3.9239130434782608
1844820,5,B00008G8Q7,"This dvd is great. I loved it .It was the next best than then ranma 1/2. Some people will like this and some won't. In the rating of this dvd I think it is pg-13. There is vilonce,langauge,alcohal,but there is no nudity in this dvd at all. If you don't believe me look in the ninja scroll animerica. I think the ratings on amazon are good but some are incorrected.",1067644800,,364,4.214285714285714
1844821,5,B00008G8Q7,"Full Metal Panic is not the height of originality.  It doesn't try to be.  In feel, it's similar to other shows by the studio Gonzo, such as Vandread, and focuses much more on execution than originality.
Full Metal Panic is an alternate-world science fiction show in which the major powers use giant robots to fight, and a secret organization called Mithril fights terrorism and illegal drugs.  The episodes on this first disc (of 7) move easily and smoothly between this serious aspect, and the show's comedy side, in which teenage Mithril sergeant Sousuke Sagara is ordered to guard high school girl Kaname Chidori without her knowledge.  Sousuke is a great hero--as perfectly competent in his own military arena as he is incompetent in the social setting of high school.  Kaname, who is the beautiful girl that no one wants as a girlfried because of her temper, is the perfect match for him.  As is typical of these shows, we see this immediately, while the characters do not.  But, as I said, FMP is not about originality.
If you want mind-bending shows with delusions of grandeur, FMP is not your show.  But, if you want an enjoyable romp with likeable and attractive characters and an enjoyable setting, FMP is your show.  This is what FMP is trying to be, and where it succeeds.",1060819200,5,1285,4.752252252252252
1844822,5,B00008G8Q7,"After battling secret organizations in his invisibility and hi-tech-armed mecha, Sagara Sousuke finds he and his crew of Melissa Mao and Kurz Weber...trying to blend into Jindai High School as a bodyguard 16-year-old Kaname Chidori.
Writer and director Gatou and Chigira not only pull off, but master the art of mixing giant robots, secret agents, battles in the Middle East and goofy high school adventures all in one pot. Think of it as Evangelion meets Spriggan meets GTO, without all the super heavy philosophical flavoring.
The first third of this series (meaning the all the episodes in this box set) deal mostly with Sousuke, a sergeant in the super-secret Mithril organization, as he tries to pass himself off as a high school student to make guarding Chidori much easier. Not so fast. Not only is Chidori the school's most popular girl, Sousuke isn't your regular 16-year-old either. He's a hardened veteran, fighting in the Middle East since he was eight; he has tremendous fighting skills, nerds out and pilots an Armed Slave, the giant, cloaking mechas that every army in the world now uses. And it shows as the class watches slack-jawed as he introduces himself as ""Sergeant Sagara Sousuke"" and lists off his interests as Armed Slaves and military tactical magazines. He realizes his error and finally corrects, reluctantly, by pretending to be a fan of music equivalent to Britney Spears. Backups Mao and Weber laugh the whole time, monitoring from a nearby Armed Slave and monitoring station.
This type of hilarity easily carries the first third of the show, never getting old, no matter how many times the principal doesn't realize that the guns Sousuke keeps bringing to school aren't toys. All the characters stay true to form: Mao and Weber as the older brother/sister types, trying to get Sousuke to fit in; Chidori as popular girl who would never date, but seems intrigued by Sousuke; and Sousuke as the dysfunctional teen, ever paranoid that everyone's trying to attack Chidori.
Which, generally, they are. The series turns much darker as the episodes crack into the teens. Turns out Chidori is a ""Whispered,"" psychics blessed with an in-depth knowledge of ""Black Technology""--of course the most valuable information ever--that they cannot comprehend, but have known since birth. That being the case, everyone from the KGB and various terrorist sects wants to get their hands on Chidori.
Enter Gaul, the main villain of the series, survivor of multiple explosions, stab wounds and even a direct sniper shot to the temple by a young Sousuke. This is one of the vilest, wickedest villains ever: ruthless, perverted, highly-skilled and nearly invincible. If Hannibal Lecter was ever allowed to pilot a giant armed robot, his name would be Gaul. Sousuke dispatches most everyone he comes across, but Gaul proves an eternal thorn in his side, right up to the series' climactic end.
The art, particularly in this first boxed set, is incredible. Although the art goes from a 10 to a 9.7 from the first set to the rest of the series, it's a hardly noticeable aspect. CG effects are in quite a few of the shots, especially of the Mithril moving super-submarine base the ToyBox. The fights are ninja-quick and visually dazzling. The music is one of its weaker points, leaning on poppy, guitar-riffed backgrounds, but this isn't a bother either.
It's just the right mix of things; enough tragedy to balance out the comedy, enough fighting to balance out the romance and enough character development to balance out the technology. It's a very surface-level story, not heavily-splashed with philosophy as Evangelion is. The series is self-containing and provides closure, but doesn't close itself out to the possibility that another Full Metal season could be in the works. Recommended for all anime fans and newbies.",1056153600,17,3826,5.055379746835443
7983213,5,B00008G8Q7,Excellent series to have!!,1447977600,,26,5.75
7983214,5,B00008G8Q7,"Damn fun series, though  it does alternate in tone at times from slapstick high school humor, to actually intense robot fighting with people dying left and right.",1442188800,,162,5.0
7983215,5,B00008G8Q7,"FMP is the story of Kaname and the Mercenary Sousuke. Kaname is a high school student that holds the key to black technology. An advanced form of technology used in military applications. Sousuke is a mercenary assigned to guard her. The problem is that he has been fighting battles since he was a young boy, and he has no common sense or social skills. He is always causing trouble for her, but he's the best candidate to keep her safe. The story follows their adventures from their high school all the way to the battlefield and back again.

FMP has everything you could want out of an anime series. Action, comedy, drama, sci-fi, and a bit of romance. The animation, story, and soundtrack are all awesome. It's a 5 star series in every possible aspect. It also stars the best voice actors in the business. I have always loved this series and I hope you do too.",1353888000,,863,4.496815286624204
7983216,5,B00008G8Q7,"very delightful start to a series..

has a great mix of that classic anime feel and a interesting story...

over all this was above my expectations and the other reviews on here.",1207699200,,178,4.53125
7983217,3,B00008G8Q7,"Full Metal Panic Mission 01 contains the first four episodes of the anime series about a mysterious group called ""The Whispered"" and the secret counter-terrorism unit protecting them.  Like Gatekeepers, the setup is that a soldier will go undercover as a high-school student, while having access to high-tech equipment.

Sousuke, a serious-minded young man, has been appointed to guard Kaname, a beautiful girl.  Kaname is thought to be a kidnapping target of the KGB.  The real villian turns out to be someone they thought was dead, a real vile guy.

The other operatives are a horny blond German guy, and a competent woman.  They assist Sousuke by keeping electronic surveillance tabs on him and the target.  They also have mecha robots that they can render invisible.

Unlike most manga heroines, I really like Kaname.  She is a realistic person.

Extras are pretty much non-existent.  Only production sketches.",1143244800,,914,5.149659863945578
7983218,5,B00008G8Q7,"I hesitate to call this a mech anime, though that's what many classify this as, because, at least in this volume, they are rarely ever in their mechs, and when they are they aren't using them for anything in particular. I don't, however, hesitate to call this series funny or action-packed, because it's definitely both of them. The comedy, coming at odd moments most of the time, is genuine and never actually forced, like anime sometimes does (like when characters fall over in surprise). And the action is spaced nicely between each episode, and not all of it is meant to be serious. In fact, a lot of the action goes in conjunction with the comedy.

The story in this volume introduces Sousuke Sagara, a young sergeant of the anti-terrorist group Mithril. He's an expert on weapons, on arm-slaves (the name they use for their mechs), and on military tactics. What he's isn't an expert on is everyday life. On the other end is Kaname Chidori, a regular Japanese high school girl who, for some reason, has become the target of some rather evil looking terrorists. Therefore Sousuke is charged to go undercover as a high school student and protect her. It doesn't start well. First, his guns are confiscated (but luckily the teacher thinks them as toys), he almost blows his cover, and he just creeps out most of the girls in the school. Still, he sticks with it, and eventually he's able to gain Chidori's trust.

It appears to me that GONZO has yet another masterpiece (let's count em: Last Exile, Chrono Crusade, GANTZ, Samurai 7, Gankutsuou, and that's from the ones I've seen). So, if you're a fan of GONZO, or just high-quality anime, then Full Metal Panic is an anime for you. Also, if you enjoy mech anime, I can also recommend this, though be warned that the mechs aren't used so often that I could consider this a true-blue giant-robo anime. It's early yet, though, so that doesn't mean anything.",1140912000,2,1907,4.6895522388059705
7983219,3,B00008G8Q7,"I've only watched this DVD and a couple episodes of Mission 02, but I was not really that impressed.  Maybe it gets better.  The good things about it are the visuals and some good character interactions.  I really don't understand why people are rating it so high.  The plot is..well..childish.  And while it may be geared for teenagers, it doesn't mean you have to make it unbelievable and cheesy.  It's almost as if the writers are trying to expunge all their schoolboy fantasies in one cathartic script.

Sousuke is a teenager in an elite military organization that is sent to high school to protect a beautiful girl named Kaname, who harbors secret abilities and is a possible target of kidnapping.  By the KGB.  The KGB.  I was waiting for the sneering moustached villain to show up, and he does, except with a bristle 5 o'clock shadow.  And military and robotic technology has progressed enough to have giant piloted robots, Arm slaves, and cloaking devices.

Sousuke is a dangerous and cunning fighter with an efficient and professional organization behind him.  Which, however, fails to tell him how to act or not act in high school.  Like not bringing guns to school.  And that thinks sending in a 50 foot robot, albeit cloaked, is good way to go undercover.  It's just so cheesy.

I wanted to like to the show I really did.  But what was over top were the peek-a-boo shots of Kaname's [...], legs, or [...].  What are the writers 13?!  It's just too much hormone-filled school boy fantasy to even have fun with.  And the funny parts are just too predictable to be comical.

But they do a good job of cliffhanging the episodes to make you want to see what's going to happen.  And the characters are likable enough that you're not too bored.  But there are better series out there.",1102032000,9,1789,4.642172523961661
7983220,4,B00008G8Q7,"This is an interesting Anime in that it is both the silly, funny style that is so prevelent in shows like Ramna and Tenchi Muyo, and the serious psychological war flick like Macross and Neon Genisis Evangelion.  The really interesting part is that Full Metal Panic manages to be not nearly so good as any of the Anime I just mentioned.

A lot of reviews for this Anime coin the words unorigonal and shallow.  Well...they are right.  The mecha, while being a more prominent aspect in later episodes, are basically nothing new.  The unorthadox guy and ill tempered girl combo is just as tired.  Full Metal Panic milks every aspect of its two stolen genre for everything they are worth too, trust me.  Any student of either silly anime or mecha/war anime will probably see direct rips from their favorite show in these DVD's somewhere.

After this brutal assault, some may wonder why I have given this DVD a 4?  Well...its hard to expalin.  Even though I scoffed frequently at the bad military lingo and obvious mis-understanding of war, I still was entranced by the combat sequences.  And even though I have never been a big fan of stupid funny Anime, I kinda enjoyed the short bursts of it intermixed with the more serious toned fighting.  I also give this DVD a 4 because I mean for it to apply to the entire series, which does pick up.",1097366400,4,1336,4.567226890756302
7983221,3,B00008G8Q7,"Personally, I thought the first four episodes of this anime were decent, but nothing spectacular that's going to motivate me to buy the other 6 DVDs in the series. I recommend that you try out the anime first, and decide whether or not to buy it later: New Type magazine has had an episode on one issue's complimentary DVD.

One thing that I didn't like about this anime was the character development, there's not much personality in the characters--but that maybe because it is the first four episodes. The Mecha were also a turn off, but that's just personal preference, I'm not much into Mecha and military animes. Lastly, the comical scenes are really not that funny. They don't contain those certain elements of character or situation that are supposed to make certain events comical.

Well, if you truly wish to buy this DVD without listening to my recommendation of trying it out, you're in for a risky venture, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger :)",1090454400,,966,4.744047619047619
