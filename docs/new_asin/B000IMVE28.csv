2659152,5,B000IMVE28,"If you are a Rocky Marciano fan , you'll enjoy this dvd. It gives a detailed account of his life from  begining to end, and interviews friends and his brothers and sisters , who  give insight to Rocky personaly. Rare photos and training clips make this dvd very interesting also. Direct and centered on Rocky it's very entertaining.",1225929600,,332,4.706896551724138
2659153,5,B000IMVE28,"Rocky was one of my idols when I was kid, but I really didn't know much about him. This video does a good job of presenting the man behind the fists, introducing us to his family, friends, manager, and trainer. It's also a nice portrait of Brockton, Mass., a mill town in the forties and fifties. Clips of many of Rocky's fights supply the excitement.",1220054400,4,351,4.415384615384616
2659154,5,B000IMVE28,"I watched this fascinating biography/documentary on the life of Undefeated Heavy Weight Champion Boxer 'Rocky Marciano' and found that it was more than just a superficial look at the unlikely champion boxer. The facts and more importantly the background of the greatest heavy weight to ever set foot in the ring are covered with respect and love in this wonderful biography! It was Rocky's determination that set him part from all other boxers and that is why he remains the only undefeated champion of the ring!

Being rather small in size with a freakishly short reach, this incredible hero defied all odds and basically knocked anyone's block off who stepped into the ring with him! Retiring with a record of 49 - 0 with 43 knock outs, this bulldog with a wicked right cross would overcome all who opposed him.

Adding weight to this ""bio"", Marciano's surviving siblings and close friends are present to give details and tell wonderful stories about the late great boxers life and accomplishments (in and out of the ring). It's sad that such a wonderful person had to meet such a tragic end. I'm not taking anything away from all the great boxers in history, but Rocky's record tells the story plain and simple.",1213056000,9,1214,4.803827751196172
2659155,5,B000IMVE28,"If you or someone you love is a boxing aficionado, but only for boxers pre-1970, this dvd would make the perfect little everyday gift or stocking stuffer. Can't beat the price either - you'll learn lots of interesting tidbits about the Rock.",1212796800,4,241,4.761904761904762

2659173,4,B000IMVE28,"If you've already seen a few boxing documentaries, especially Ali documentaries you may be spoiled a little.  This documentary seems to be for the most part, perspectives from Rocky Marciano's family members, and a few other close people.  It would have been nice to hear a little more from boxing historians, but I guess that is not the angle this production tried to take.  For what it is, it is enjoyable and informative.  I learned a few things and really gained respect for the raw, truly awesome power in The Rock's fists, especially his anvil-like right hand.  WOW.",1303948800,,572,4.795918367346939
2659174,5,B000IMVE28,"Not really into boxing I watched this with my father and instantly became a Rocky Marciano fan. The film delves into his family life from an early age all the way through to his final years with commentary and interviews with a wide assortment of family members, friends, and many others that were close to him.
The film covers his training and fighting career extensively in an easy to follow manner that focuses on his incredible work ethic outside the ring, and determination within the ring that lead him to win every fight in his professional career despite physical disadvantages such as a short reach which led early coaches and trainers to advise against continuing boxing.
The whole biopic takes an in depth look into how his personal life shaped his ring life such as how his fathers hard work in the shoe factory to take care of his family instilled a work ethic in Rocky which led to his dropping out of highschool his sophomore despite the prospect of an athletic scholarship to work in the factory to take care of his 4 brothers and sisters, later enlisting into the army, and after that working shoveling coal for $1 an hour. This hard work ethic led to his strenuous training outside the ring which brought him his success in his fights.
To top this all off this movie examines his role as a cultural icon both to the Italian-Americans in helping take away from the Mafia stereotype that dominated in his time and instilling pride within their community as well as also being an American icon embodying hard work, family values, generosity, kindness, and ultimately success. A great watch even for those not into boxing this film will definitely leave you with genuine respect for Rocky Marciano with almost a sense of familiarity with him, and will hopefully inspire you to strive to live up to the same values he embodied for us all.",1286496000,,1851,4.6984615384615385

8146448,3,B000IMVE28,Not a bad documentary . Only problem is that it's pretty one sided and didn't really narrow in on his well known reputation for having been the cheapest boxer to have ever lived.
