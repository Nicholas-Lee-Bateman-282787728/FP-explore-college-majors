8060237,5,B0009G3BOM,"I watched this movie its a grindhouse movie. I love those.  SS Experiment is hot, I would of liked it better if it was just naked guys too. I think most straight men will love love this movie because of the gay women making out.",1338940800,2,228,4.066666666666666
8060238,3,B0009G3BOM,"After Red Nights of the Gestapo you can see again the italian actor Giorgio Cerioni (aka George Greenwood) in cheapy Z-movie. he was the only decision to buy this movie.

It has one or two interesting, thrilling scenes but 95% are not very interesting.

Sound and picture of ra movie like this more than OK.",1217462400,2,307,4.5636363636363635
8060239,1,B0009G3BOM,"I bought this Euro cult film because the genre is appealing to the Capt.  It even recieved a 5 star review from another customer here on Amazon.

What a disappointment.  Sure there is plenty of scenes with nude women (with very hairy beavers) running around the Nazi camp...but aside from the nudity, there is little else compelling about this film.

One of the main premises is a mean Nazi Colonel has the camp doctors surgically steal and then implant another Nazi guard's testicles into his sack!

This enrages the guard (duh!) so he goes on a killing spree of his own guards....not the enticing subject matter of a hot, Euro trash, sex flick in my opinion.

I would have liked to see more sex and torture of these women inmates...that's what people who buy these '70's farces want to see.

There was one potentially hot scene in a camp brothel where one of the drunken Nazi's makes a shy girl (she is very hot!) dance around nude for him....then he has sex with her (but they don't show the sex between them)...and then he hangs her from a wooden post naked in the camp yard, while she is left there bleeding and screaming...the whole scene could have been much more erotic...instead it was jumbled up into a lame sequence and it was poorly executed.

All in all, I am not happy I bought this lame film.  Save your money....",1202083200,10,1328,4.523012552301255
8060240,5,B0009G3BOM,"This is the single most important movie ever made. It changed my life as this film made me ask the question Who is god? What is the meaning of life? and most importantly why are germans so weird? So go buy this movie because if your like me and like movies about sexy lesbos at concentration camps you will go ""nuts"" for this movie",1131321600,30,331,4.1875
