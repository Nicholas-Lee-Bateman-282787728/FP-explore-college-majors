8746993,4,B004VFNN8Q,"I liked this DVD because it tries to depict an actutal historic occurence in China in 17th century. It is an old movie. The spoken language is in Cantonese with good & concise English subtitles. I would recommend it for history buffs who would like to find out about the history of Dutch occupation of Taiwan. For those who wish to follow the events of Taiwan, this is a good start. After the Sino-Dutch war, events led Taiwan to be under Japanese rule from 1895-1945, followed by an exodus of China's Nationalists from mainland China during Communist take over, and the occupation and settling of the Nationalists since then.",1352592000,2,626,4.752293577981652
