2637408,5,B000HEWEFS,"I have viewed this movie twice in the span of three days and even though it does not follow the books (what movie does?) I believe it is the best production so far. The girl that played Molly was excellent and looked exactly like the illustrations in the books. When not comparing the script to the books, this movie gives a very good look at what it was like to be at home when someone dear to you is involved in a war far away. The range of emotions experienced by Molly, Emily, Jill and Ricky were wonderfully captured. The changes in the role of a mother/woman during those times was exemplified by Mrs. McIntire and the patriotism that was so evident during that period of history wonderfully portrayed.

I would highly recommend this movie to both adults and children.",1164758400,8,774,4.5285714285714285
2637409,2,B000HEWEFS,"I caught the last half of this movie on TV and was disappointed that the movie didn't follow along with the book. Molly gets sick in the book and is unable to dance in the Miss Victory recital but in the movie she isn't sick. In the book, she is at home sick while her family is at the recital and her daddy comes home from overseas. In the movie, he appears backstage after her performance. Molly and her sister hide a Christmas package their father sent until Christmas day in the book but in the movie, their father passes out the gifts in the family's living room.

The acting was nice, the costumes were excellant and the backdrop was well executed. If you can get over the fact the show strayed from the book you'll be able to enjoy the show. Personally, I liked the book's portayal of events better. It shows what would happen in real life, not in an ideal life.",1164758400,11,869,4.298780487804878

2637449,5,B000HEWEFS,"From what I gather from the catalogs they keep sending me, Molly is a spirited 4th grader who is into the war effort in 1944.  This film portrays her as a 3rd grader in 1943 who has very mixed feelings about what the war means to her and her family.  Her mixed emotions are fleshed out with her responses to newsreels - which appear to be authentic footage of the time - and personal situations such as the departure of her father for London to give medical assistance and of her favorite aunt for WASP training in Texas.  She works through her fears and emerges as a more mature 4th grader, determined to do what she can.  This includes her working on her tap dancing so she can appear as Miss Victory and sharing her room with a girl from London.

I know it's a doll story, but the tale is endearing because the effect of the war on children this age is somewhat undertold. They made a good choice showing how Molly had to understand what the war meant and mature a little before she could get perky.  The newsreel footage of the young children sent away from London for safety was particularly affecting.  Molly Ringwald is a standout as far as the actors are concerned, portraying the working mother.

Three good extras include instruction on Molly's tap routine, fairly simple and quite well-cued; an interview with two WASP pilots of the era, which was good, if a little heavy-handed on the moderator's message that girls can do anything; and a charming interview with a tap dancer who performed for soldiers during the war.  She was born in 1918, and at the time of this movie in 2006, still dancing!

Give it a chance, it's worth a look.",1420243200,,1645,4.471571906354515
2637450,5,B000HEWEFS,Wonderful story of a time past. Well made. Great characters.  And my daughter has the doll Molly and this movie they watched together and she learned a lot about love fear and family. Great movie!!!,1419465600,,198,4.6571428571428575
2637451,4,B000HEWEFS,"Molly McIntire is a young elementary school aged girl growing up in mid 1940s Jefferson, Illinois. Her idyllic life is disrupted when her doctor dad decides to enlist and help out with the war effort in Europe. It is left to Mollys mom (played by Molly Ringwald) to help keep the family afloat, working in a factory putting together fighter planes. Molly is at first very resentful of her dad going off to war and her mom getting a job, and her resentment grows even more when she comes home one day to find a British evacuee in her home. Expected to share her room with the evacuee, Emily, Molly feels her world is crumbling, but a series of events helps Molly see that in times of war, compromises need to be made, and compassion is all important.
I agree with some reviewers that the film does not do the books justice and this is perhaps one of the weaker AG films (my nine-year-old and I loved the Samantha and Kit Kittredge films). This is due to the many liberties taken with the storyline, a great departure from the books, and the fact that the main cast for the most part is not very well-cast. The actress playing Molly seems awkward and ill-suited to her role, and the other cast members are also rather stilted in their performances.
However, what made this a worthwhile watch was the attention to period details which makes this film another engaging movie in the AG franchise of films. It may not be their best effort, but the historical details and overall storyline does entertain and keep the viewers attention engaged. I hope AG will make more of such films that deal with Americas past.",1419379200,,1606,4.541379310344827
2637452,5,B000HEWEFS,Wonderful movie-- very true to the book and provides a great look at life during WW2 for little girls. I enjoyed watching it almost as much as my two daughters (ages 5 and 3).,1418601600,,175,4.176470588235294
2637453,5,B000HEWEFS,"The ""home front"", of course, being the WWII-era U.S. Better than the vast majority of TV/movie entertainment available to families.

2637454,5,B000HEWEFS,My 8 year old loves this movie. It's based on the American Girl doll Molly Macintire who lived during WWII. It's entertaining while showing how life was during that time period in America.,1413590400,,188,4.7272727272727275

2637459,5,B000HEWEFS,"I have seen all four of the American Girl ""historical"" films, and all four the American Girl movies set in the present day.  Of the  eight American Girl films ""Molly"" is my favorite.  It is a touching story, superbly written and I guarantee it will captivate the young girls in your household while teaching them a great deal about the turbulent 1940's when almost every American family was required to contribute to the war effort. The film is very entertaining and will provide you and your kids a lot to talk about when the film is over.  Also very interesting are the special features, which include interviews with elderly woman who, in the war years, were Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) responsible for both flight testing and also delivering American warplanes from  factories to Army Airforce bases in the US, and Europe.  Love the photos of these ladies as young women, looking very cool  in their leather flight suits.  (In the movie, Molly's sister is on her way to begin her Wasp training In Texas.).  This is a very good film.  I originally bought it for a nine year old family member but since then I have watched it a couple of  times for my own enjoyment.
  If you are interested in purchasing this DVD I would suggest getting, through Amazon, AMERICAN Girl 4 FAVORITES which includes Molly and three other American Girl historical movies for the very low price of about $12.  The other three movies, FELICITY, SAMANTHA and KIT KITTRIDGE are also quite good and feature child actors Abigail Breslin and Anna Lisa Robb, both of whom went on to win acclaim in big budget Hollywood productions.  This is a great bargain guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment for your family and many more hours of discussion afterwards.",1406246400,,1746,4.773333333333333
2637460,5,B000HEWEFS,"My 8 and 6 year old granddaughters and I loved this movie. A little history and a little fiction well written and produced. A top notch movie - clean, wholesome. principled, and lots to talk about and it kept their minds off the horrendous thunderstorm beating against our house as we watched. We were inspired to watch it because we loved the first one we viewed on Amazon Prime - ""Kit Kittredge"" and the girls have seen two other American Girl movies which are also offered on Amazon. Enjoy!",1405036800,,493,4.550561797752809

2637475,4,B000HEWEFS,"A wonderful period piece as seen from the view of children living during the world war II years. Those at home made many, many sacrifices while most of the able bodied men served in the European and the South Pacific war efforts.

Telling the story from a child's view softens the story yet captures the pulsing life dramas that life and death struggle brought to America.

I did not give a five star rating because I thought the lead character was played with too bright a personality in such serious circumstances.

The Woody Allan movie, Radio Days, gives a very enjoyable glimpse of family life during the war years with both humor and pathos. If you enjoy this film then Radio Days should be considered for viewing.",1392076800,,720,4.653543307086614

2637481,5,B000HEWEFS,"My kidss (daughter age 6 1/2 and son 8 1/2) really liked it, and it taught them things about WW II and life at that time that they did not know.  There were a couple of sad moments where deaths of solders in Europe were mentioned (two characters in the movie have a loved one die), but this was reality at this time, and kids had to deal with it as best they could.  This story is about a 9 year old girl during WW II who wants to be the star of a school tap show, idolizes her pretty teacher, and must deal with her doctor father having to go off to war while also having to share her bedroom with a British girl her age (Emily) that her parents are letting stay with her.  The British girl is not all she seems to be, as Molly finds out.  This is not as exciting as the Kit Carson movie in terms of plot twists, but is just right for kids in the 6-12 age group, IMHO.  No bad language or unsuitable situations, very wholesome.  Wish there was a movie like this for every American girl book.",1389139200,,992,4.01015228426396

Believe me, it does so astonishingly well. Frankly, I did not expect much from such a modest, unheralded release, but ""An American Girl on the Home Front"" is a sincere effort that should shame the shallow-minded producers of Hollywood rubbish. The screenplay is convincing, the performances and direction are uniformly excellent, and the sense of period is wonderfully captured, with evocative props, staging, and costumes. The people on screen seem utterly real instead of cardboard stereotypes, and the plot kept me guessing. I genuinely felt for these characters - even bringing tears to the eyes - and the film made me wish for a simpler, more innocent time than what we experience today.

2637514,5,B000HEWEFS,"This is the 3rd American Girl movie I've seen w/my children & Molly like the others, are hearwarming, fun, and filled with many social, emotional, and historical education/discussion opportunities. Molly's setting takes place in WWII America--a time that most of us (here in the U.S., at least) can't really imagine. While the movie shows no war scenes, it does mention that people have (particularly soldiers) have died.

Molly is a little girl that at first acts selfishly when she finds out her father (a doctor) has volunteered to help wounded soldiers and her mother subsequently goes to work in the factories because they are asking everyone to do their part for the war effort. Molly becomes even more upset when she finds out they're taking in a young girl from England who's been either orphaned or displaced because now she has to share her room, etc.

Over the course of the movie, Molly grows to not only to accept her family's circumstances, but tries to help out in positive ways. She joins the collection efforts (of scrap metal, old clothes, etc.), she spends time preparing care packages for soldiers, and most of all she bonds with the little girl (her own age) who lost her mother in a building blast and whose father (unwillingly) sent her away for protection. This is very sad. I used this part of the story to give my kids a little more background & explained a bit what that place in our country's history may have been like.

As each day passes, more and more neighbors, friends, and family receive the dreaded 'telegram' informing them that either their loved one was killed, wounded, or missing. The day eventually came that the telegram delivery man knocked on Molly's door.

During this time, Molly (as are her friends) are part of a tap dancing group and prepare for a big recital. The recital is the only happy thing Molly has to look forward to and works very hard to get the lead part. She decides to quit because she just can't take all the sadness and worry anymore. Ultimately, she decides to stick with it and endure the best she can. She becomes determined to overcome the adversities she faces in her life. Great lesson there.

In the end, while much of the local community is left struggling with their grief and uncertainty, many (including Molly and her family) find ways to stick together, make the best of what they're dealt, and come out stronger than before. Let me warn you, it's a tear-jerker, but a happy one. I normally don't watch the movies I let my kids watch more than once, but this one I can watch again and again.

I definitely recommend American Girl movies and books.",1377820800,,2625,4.670995670995671

Samantha and Felicity's movies stayed true to the books they are based off of; Molly's falls short of the mark there. So many things got changed that it's just a disappointment. To name a few: Molly's brother Brad is not here, Mrs. Gilford is a neighbor instead of the housekeeper, and Emily plays a much bigger part than in the books (which was only one book). Little things but they add up, and if you're at all familiar with the books you'll find yourself wondering what happened. Overall though, I'd still recommend this movie: the time period is portrayed accurately and the addition of Emily demonstrates the cultural differences between America and England. If that's what you're looking for, watch this movie. If you're looking for the same quality as the other American Girl movies, where there is the same storyline as the books, you'll want to pass.

2637571,4,B000HEWEFS,"Taken as a story unto itself, this film is pretty entertaining for kids or adults who'd like to see a slice of family life during WWII.  I come not to this film as a fan of American girl books & films & dolls, but someone already 50 who likes to see everyday life in the past well portrayed.

Plenty here have complained that the film deviates quite a bit from the book, but in that case, I say, don't read the book at all - or do it later !

Reading is so passe, so pre-2000, isn't it?

Molly McIntyre is living in a big comfortable suburban house in 1943, with a doctor for a father, kind and understanding, a stay-at-home Mom, a younger brother and older sister.  She's in third grade, hangs out with two other girls, loves movies and starlets, likes tapdancing but is far too klutzy, and comes across essentially as a very smart, thinking kid.  Perhaps it's the plainness of her face, staight hair and glasses, but it's more than that:  in an Anne-Frank intensity, she hounds people with questions and wants to understand the world, the adults, love, the war, everything NOW!

This cozy scene is rapidly disrupted:  the father decides to volunteer in England to help wounded soldiers, the mother is forced to find paid work and goes off to an ammunition factory every day, and a widowed neighbor comes to be the housekeeper and cook.

Furthermore, her own beloved teacher's fiance has to go off to war, and he is ultimately killed.

Her favorite aunt cannot come and stay, because she's going off to be a pilot in Texas, where the best female pilots are chosen to help fight the war.

Her tapdance teacher announces that the best of the dancers will become Miss Victory in the Christmas pageant, so all the girls begin practicing, but especially awkward Molly.

A girl from England arrives to live with them, daughter of an upper-class home, and Molly must share her room with her.

Yes, this is not the most gnarled and thrilling of plots, but for 9-year-old girls it's enough to handle.  I enjoyed watching the kids act their roles, wearing their 1940's clothing, listening to the music, seeing the cars on the streets, and realizing that there's no TV, no internet, no access to instant downloads of music.  There's multiculturalism, as it's clear that one friend is Italian-American and another Jewish.  The school is old-fashioned and strict, much as I remember my own 1960's Catholic school days.  There's even a big spelling bee with the whole school and parents in attendance.

It's light entertainment and a far cry from modern Hollywood films for kids.  It's much more like the 1950's films we knew.  I watched those girls in their dresses, bobby socks and shoes, wondering if such a fashion would ever come back.

The one thought crossing my adult mind:  wouldn't a doctor's family be well off enough that the mother wouldn't have to work?  Weren't army doctors paid well?  If not, would the father have made such a decision, to put his family in financial straits enough that his wife had to take factory work?  I wonder!??

The movie touches base with the war efforts, our men in uniform, the wives of our men overseas, families.  Emily, a British citizen and the same age as Molly, comes to stay in America with Molly and her family while Emily's dad is away fighting in the British military. Many children in Britain were evacuated from their country during WWII. Emily's mother was killed during the Blitz in London.  Molly at first has a difficult time accepting Emily until she really gets to know her.  Lovely story about family, patriotism, faith, and hope.",1291075200,2,732,5.024793388429752

2637576,4,B000HEWEFS,"The American Girl of the 21st century can entertain herself with a cell phone, laptop, or ipod. That's probably why I enjoyed this trip through time back to 1940's America where Molly and her pals get their information from printed newspapers and movie footage, listen to the radio at night, and take tap dance lessons after school. It's important for girls of today to learn what life was like before modern conveniences of the digital age. It's educational and enjoyable for the pre-teen girls of today without being overly-cloying for adults.

For a TV-made-film Maya Ritter bring Molly to life adequately and I like the touch of tomboy persistence in Molly's character. Every time shemanages to accept a new change due to the severity of WWII, something new turns up: her father leaves for England, her mother takes a factory job, and a shy English girl comes to live with them. Who could blame her for not liking turnips or being annoyed with Emily? Ritter's Molly is down-to earth and realistic: we read the shock or annoyance on her face when she is faced with changes. But she is a good person at heart and capable of making the sacrifices people ask of her.

Molly isn't a ball-dancing Felicity or a wealthy Samantha.  She's an ordinary girl who wants to have fun with her friends but is unexpectedly asked to be brave and strong while making big sacrifices. Lots of kids today know about having a family relative or friend fighting overseas, sharing their home with people in need, and taking time out of your schedule to volunteer.

I did notice some movie changes from the Molly books but they stayed true to the heart and messages of the stories. Of course, Molly Ringwald was another wonderful addition to the story as Molly's ""Rosie the Riveter"" mother but the entire cast did a decent job. As a person interested in history and a woman who grew up on the American Girl books, I believe the American Girl of today will learn some worthwhile messages from this film....and find a relevant friend in Molly MacIntire.",1275264000,3,2029,4.72316384180791

Molly was taught to never give up and she didn't.  The way they developed the friendship between Molly and Emily was so innocent and sweet.  And, watching Molly make choices in the movie - like not telling everyone that Emily had fibbed due to peer pressure - was another good lesson as well.

Our daughter is 7.  We watch the movies together because she does have questions like why/what did that mean.  I cry at each movie which is also teaching  her that it's okay to cry because  you're empathetic.  Great family movie!",1265760000,,668,4.349593495934959

I did see the other American Girl movie adaptations, but when I saw Molly An American Girl on the Home Front I fell in love with it immediately, and thought it was the best adapted one, and very accurate to the time period...meaning clothing, the house, the hairstyles,cars,bikes, and so much more.

  Maya Ritter did such a  terrific job  as Molly, that all the time I was watching her, it was like seeing Molly  come to life out of the books, and onto the screen. She was really cute, and just spot-on perfect as Molly! I give it 5 stars, because all the characters from the Molly books were well portrayed, and also the fact that Molly is defintely my favorite, and they made me really happy with this spectacular adaptation. Molly An American on the Home Front is  the best American Girl movie ever. They also followed the storyline of the books perfectly, and this had such a wonderful wholesome, captivating, and terrific feeling while watching it.

How refreshing to not have the usual hateful,smart-mouthed kid's characters that are in so many preteen/teen movies.

 No crude or toilet humor either! Great values lessons about compassion,sacrifice and pulling together. This is  truly a 'feel-good' movie. Highly recommended for family viewing,along with another sweet American Girl film 'Samantha: An American Girl Holiday'.

 I haven't yet seen the new Kit Kitteridge:An American Girl,but I want to,unlike the 'An American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong' which I have no desire to see or have my granddaughter watch,because there is already an overabundance of movies with snotty,hateful,smart mouth kids!

Give me more that are a breath of fresh air,any day,like Molly and Samantha,and hopefully Kit. Plus I want to check out 'Felicity: An American Girl Adventure'.

So if you and your family would enjoy a really nice family film with really sweet characters that is totally non-offensive,and even gives a little history lesson you won't be disappointed in either 'Samantha:An American Girl Holiday',or my favorite so far 'Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front'(even though the acting by Molly Ringwald,as Molly's mom,is somewhat flat).

I was excited to find the DVD available at the library and thought my six year old daughter and I would enjoy watching it. Wrong.  When the Dad announced to the family that he had enlisted in the army (while they were in the basement during an air raid), my daughter decided it was going to be a scarey movie and we turned it off.  I returned later, convinced the movie would be GREAT and watched it to the end. It soon became clear that this movie is laughably bad!  So bad, it's funny. Molly Ringwald, who plays the Mom, was wooden throughout.  I wonder who she annoyed in the Make-Up department.  That orange lipstick is distracting!  It seems like a satire!  From the teacher learning that her fiance has been killed in the war (from a telegram delivered to her as she judged the spelling bee; she then, sobbing loudly, had to be assisted out of the auditorium) to the film clips of young English children leaving their families by train to the McIntire family appearing stricken every time their doorbell rang...laughably bad.

First, I was pleased by the war setting, the pretty costumes and the historical setting. But I was less impressed with the acting. I felt that Molly's acting, her mother, and the teacher were quite wooden. The little British girl was well done... But overall I felt the acting was quite mediocre.

I found Molly to be unlikable. She seemed very modern and bratty. Her concerns seem really superficial in lieu of the events going on around her. That's okay to begin with, but it took a while for her to become more sympathetic. Watching Molly pout about eating turnips and having no ice cream when there is a war going on seemed petty.

The plot was fairly straightforward and should be easy for children to grasp, but unlike Samantha there was no real sense of jeopardy or hardship (other than what she eats) for Molly to go through, and her life seems fairly privileged... As her family can afford a housekeeper whilst most families could not. 2 stars. Perhaps children would like this film more than I, but I was underwhelmed.

2637604,2,B000HEWEFS,"My 9 yr. old son has been reading his big sisters' Molly books, and he wanted to see this movie, so we borrowed it from Netflix. What a disappointment! Sure, the girl looked liked Molly, but the similarity ended there. In the books, Molly is a happy, spirited, spunky girl who is cheerful and happy to do her part for the war effort. In this film, she was depressive, negative, selfish, a whiner, etc. The actress was probably chosen for the look-alike feature alone, because she was a HORRIBLY BAD BAD actress!!! She was very wooden and stiff, showed zero emotion vocally or physically. Really, she was awful, and pretty hard to watch. Molly Ringwald as the mother wasn't very good either; it seems people nowadays just don't know how to act.

What bothered us was the major changes in the story. The books are so nice as they are, and I think children expect to see the books played out in the movie. The changes were not necessary, and it was like a different story. My son kept saying he wanted to see the Halloween stuff, the camping stuff, and Christmas how it was in the book. I really can't understand why they changed it so much. I was glad when it was over, because this Molly was not the happy and cheerful Molly we know from the books; she got old pretty fast.

We have seen the Samantha movie, and that was pretty good. We haven't seen the Felicity one. We think it would be fun if they did a Kit movie, but hope they don't bother if they are going to change the story and use some girl that can't act.

Seems like they could have done a ""mini series"" on Molly, so they could use all the books. But perhaps this wouldn't have worked since this actress is way over 10 yrs. old anyway.

I can't believe how many reviews I have read on this movie praising it so highly. It isn't a one star movie (torture to watch) but it was pretty close to it. I guess people don't know what makes a ""good"" movie anymore. Give me the movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s anytime! Even the silents offer so much more than this modern stuff.

2637620,5,B000HEWEFS,"My daughter and I anxiously awaited the premiere of ""Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front"" and we were not disappointed. The story centers around young Molly McIntire in the small midwestern town of Jefferson, Illinois in the mid 1940's as the United States has just entered World War II. Molly's neat,predictable world rapidly changes overnight once the USA enters World War II. Dr. McIntire, Molly's dad enlists in the army and is sent overseas to London, England where help is needed the most. Molly's mother takes a job at the local aircraft plant to make ends meet financially leaving the McIntire children in the care of a neighbor, Mrs. Gilford. Molly's family takes in a 10 year old refugee from London named Emily while Miss Campbell, Molly's teacher looses her fiance' during a bombing in London. Through all the changes and adjustments Molly keeps a positive attitude and a determined spirit which was the backbone of America's homefront. This is a movie your whole family will enjoy!

As a side note our family is anticipating next years American Girl movie which will be ""Kit"" and will be produced by Walden Media.",1166054400,40,1132,4.865284974093265
2637621,5,B000HEWEFS,"One of American Girl's newest and richest traditions--which includes producing a movie and manufacturing a new doll every holiday season--represents a recent marketing tool that can reel in AG fans of all ages. Those of us who grew up with these dolls can derive just as much excitement with these films as does the younger crowd, and this year Molly becomes the star of her very own story.

Stacking this film up against the original two movies starring Samantha and Felicity, I personally have to say that ""Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front"" easily surpassed them both. Perhaps it is because the World War II era is a memorable and relatively recent period in American history--a landmark event that current generations remember through the heartfelt accounts of grandparents, relatives, and friends over the years.

The chosen layout for this film has clearly received some heat and is viewed by the majority as poor against the first two movies. While I will not deny that the cross-over from the books to the small screen are blaring for the most loyal fans, it is not at all uncommon for screen adaptations to deviate from the written books. However, that does not mean that this movie does not stand on its own as a strong story and a worthy addition to the AG film collection.

The biggest problem with this movie, in my opinion, is that the screen time (90 minutes on the televised version, and that included commercials) didn't allow sufficient development for the several plot threads. Since the end result was scenes that were occasionally abrupt and choppy, it may have been in their best interest to emphasize fewer events within the story. Also, if you are a longtime fan of the 6-volume book collection, you will notice that there was one McIntire family member short in the film. 4-year-old brother Brad was completely eliminated, which surprised me a bit, but you have to understand that it must be difficult to find an actor that young, and some movies simply don't find the need to bother with it. The movie functioned just fine with the three older kids, and although middle brother Ricky was portrayed with a much less pesky nature as in the books, everyone delivered well.

As has been mentioned by many, Maya Ritter turned in an impressive performance in the title role. Not only did she totally look the part (maybe a little too much--haha), I think she definitely outdid Anna-Sophia Robb and Shailene Woodley from the first two American Girl movies. Her whiny behavior did get old at times, but I liked the way she matured and found her place in the war effort as the plot progressed.

These American Girl movies have also begun a tradition of selecting a bigger-name actress for the mother (or the main maternal role). If you remember, Mia Farrow portrayed Samantha's beloved Grandmary, and Marcia Gay Harden stepped in as the mother of Felicity. Now, the well-known Molly Ringwald joins this cast as the kind, loving and patient McIntire matriarch--and she played the part very well. I was surprised to see her in this role, but I must say she hit it on the nail.

I don't blame the most die-hard ""Molly"" fans for being disappointed with the changes made for this film. Personally, the Molly books were my favorite out of all the ones that were released, mostly because the spunky and spirited personality of the main character were so closely channeling something that seemed real. Molly's father was already gone for two years in the very first ""Meet Molly"" book, and during the film, he leaves at the beginning and returns a few months later. The way the writers chose to portray his emotional return to his family was a little disappointing and even slightly corny (even coming from me, a definite fan of the fluff). If the writers were to keep only one main plot thread from the original books, I would have picked this one--the finale to the ""Molly"" books that would have also created a perfect movie ending. I understand that they wanted to introduce Molly's father from the very beginning and allow viewers to get a sense of knowing his character, but perhaps they could have achieved that task more fully through flashbacks or brief scene jumps to the man's current involvement in the war.

I was very pleased with how English refugee Emily Bennett was developed in the film, and I absolutely loved Tory Green in the role. What a sweetheart she was--friendly, unassuming and painfully shy, and the gradual friendship that grew between her and Molly was done beautifully. Overall, I perceive this film as a worthy addition to your collection--well-acted, a good story (if not a little different than some fans of the books would have liked), and, as always with the AG films, indicative of how those timeless values of cooperation and friendship can span well through the passing years.",1165881600,13,4830,4.805054151624549
2637622,3,B000HEWEFS,"I agree with the other reviewers - this film is not as good as Samantha or Felicity. The changes in the story from the books are glaring and there just isn't as much beauty of spirit that the other movies had.

The DVD itself has almost no special features. There is one bit about tap dancing and then two ads. That's it! No behind the scenes, no tour of the American Girl Places, nothing.",1165363200,4,389,4.256756756756757
2637623,2,B000HEWEFS,"I've been a fan of American Girl books for nearly 20 years, and Molly has always been my favorite character. Sadly, this movie does away with all of the magic of the books. Molly is no longer bad at math. Instead, she's a spelling whiz. Her brother Brad is gone, and Miss Gilford is a neighbor rather than a housekeeper. Most of the endearing scenes and story-lines in Molly's books are left out (such as Molly and her siblings getting a tree, camping, her birthday, their snowball fight, school Lend a Hand projects, finding Dad's package and hiding it, Molly and her friends trying to give her a perm, Halloween . . . the list goes on), while some that weren't necessary are disproportionately expanded upon, such as Emily's. It would be easier for diehard Molly fans to point out what is the same between books and movie, rather than what is not, since the two hardly resemble one another. Only the turnip scene is here.

On its own, as a movie, it's also somewhat of a disappointment. The two people I watched it with didn't know anything about Molly. One struggled not to fall asleep while the other read and made phone calls. The movie is presented in a series of vignettes that are hardly connected to one another, with a trauma about Dad added to the end of the movie in order to give some semblance of a typical climax and resolution storyline. Rather than being a movie about Molly, however, Miss Campbell, Dad, and Emily get a lot of attention throughout. It seems to be a movie without a focus, searching around for a plot. It also seems dark, which is in contrast to Molly's books. Yet all the positive things that happen in the movie are things Molly could have only dreamed about in her books, such as truly getting to play Miss Victory, having her dad witness her performance, and yes--her hair can even hold a curl. It's almost as if poor Molly has been trapped in an alternate universe, where everything that didn't happen in her books happens in the movie, and vice versa. This should prove quite discombobulating for Molly fans!

On a positive note, the movie has wonderful sets and period music, such as Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy by the Andrews Sisters, and a fun jitterbug scene. Despite that, unfortunately, Molly's movie is not the best out of the offerings from American Girl.",1165276800,41,2299,4.591240875912408
2637624,3,B000HEWEFS,"This American Girl movie is my least favorite.  Anytime a book is made into a movie you should expect the screenwriters to make a few changes from the book, but this movie seemed to stray too much from the original written books.  Molly's dad is at home at the beginning of the movie; in the book he is already gone.  Molly has a younger brother in the books; he isn't in the movie.  And as a previous reviewer stated, the whole ending scene was just *wrong*.  Molly's dad was supposed to come home, not to her show.  She wasn't even IN the show in the book.  But, the folks at American Girl want to sell tie-in products to the movie, so they have a new stage, theater seats, Miss Victory dance costumes for Molly and Emily, etc.  I do like how they portrayed Emily and told her story, but again Emily was a much more minor character in the books than she is in the movie (again, there's a new Emily doll for sale at AG so naturally they need to push her significance in Molly's life).  Many many other parts were changed, mom's a factory worker in the movie vs a Red Cross volunteer in the books, Mrs. Gilford was always their housekeeper, not just after Mom went to work; little things that just seemed annoying.",1165276800,29,1214,4.312775330396476
2637625,3,B000HEWEFS,"Although my daughter enjoyed this movie, and I realize that it is geared toward the youth market, I feel it is not up to par with the first two American Girl movies, Samantha and Felicity. The main reason is I feel that it tries to cover too much ground in a little more than 90 minutes - it attempts to bring every aspect of WWII into Molly's life and, by doing that, one never really gets the chance to know the characters in any kind of depth. Maybe for the folks that read the Molly stories it doesn't matter much, but to the people who haven't, it can be a bit diconcerting.
One more on the down side: father showing up the way he did was a bit too sappy. Happy endings are great, but super-sappy endings are just that - SAPPY.
On the plus side, the sets, language, and even attitudes of the time portrayed are done very well (except for the 1957 table-top jukebox in the scene at the diner when Molly and her aunt are sitting and talking), and the original period music was an excellent touch. Also, teaching the youngsters how the war affected the little ones (and all the people) of England was a nice touch as well.
Do I recommend this? Yes, I do. Any movie (or book) that can get our youth interested in history - as long as it is done accurately - is alright in my book.
If you enjoyed the other two American Girl movies, you will probably enjoy this one, though maybe not quite as much.
I hope the next movie from this series is Kirsten, the pioneer girl. My daughter loves that era almost as much as the colonial era.",1164844800,21,1530,4.243150684931507

8139582,5,B000HEWEFS,"I got my 7 year old granddaughter a Molly doll for her birthday. I wanted her to know the history of this important era. This is a great movie. I watched it with her and I got to tell her stories of WWII from my mother and grandmother. I told her about her Great Uncles and Great Aunt who served. Seems to be very accurate, and the acting is superb! I loved Molly Ringwald as the mother. I think most people today don't have the concept of communities working together, making sacrifices. I liked seeing how Molly began as a rather selfish girl, and her maturing into a helpful, caring  person. Real life situations are in the movie, some tragic. I shed a few tears. I have seen 2 other American Girl movies and they are all wonderful.",1511481600,,735,4.326086956521739
