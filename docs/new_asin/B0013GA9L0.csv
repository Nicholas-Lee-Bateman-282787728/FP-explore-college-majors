8250865,5,B0013GA9L0,"Chromium Hook is a short film from Minnesota's Channel Z production company.
It's a very funny take on the old ""hook in the car door"" urban legend, done in the familiar Mockumentary style.
And yes it really does star Amy Adams, whose feature film debut was another Mockumentary, Drop Dead Gorgeous. She was doing theater in the Minneapolis area at that time in her life.
A must-watch for comedy fans!",1486080000,,400,4.728571428571429
