5467479,5,B00AQ0LCM4,"This is a great DVD.  In a world of lip synchers and computer enhanced performances it is refreshing to see a performer who can recreate her sound in front of a live audience.  It is such a shame that we have become used to expecting mediocrity from our ""professional"" entertainers when they are forced to perform without aids, Reba is a reminder of what entertainers used to be.",1274572800,3,379,4.5588235294117645
5467480,5,B00AQ0LCM4,"I have enjoyed Reba's music since the 1980's and she is still one of my favorite artist.  This performance really shows why Reba is a Super Star.

Reba, please convert your earlier concerts to DVD or Blu Ray format, so we can continue to enjoy your Special Gift.",1274572800,,329,4.433333333333334
5467481,1,B00AQ0LCM4,"Looking foreward finally to get a concert-DVD with Reba. Video is very good, but the audio is very disapointing. There is audio-format dolby digital 5.1 and dolby pro logic to choose from. I have now tried two different copies, and the dolby digital 5.1 do not work. Be aware if you expect surround sound.",1269216000,4,305,4.666666666666667

5467492,5,B00AQ0LCM4,"Reba's first live concert DVD is perfect! Even though it's a CMT show and focuses heavily on ""Keep On Lovin' You"" material, the set does include a Q&A with Reba and bonus questions not included on the one hour telecast. The set is packaged in a super jewel case and is susceptible to cracks. The booklet does include credits.",1431648000,,325,4.52542372881356

5467519,5,B00AQ0LCM4,"First of all you need to know that I am a huge Reba fan. I have been since the 80's so anything she does is great to me. I was fortunate enough to be at this taping. It was an awesome experience and Reba is one down to earth person. She was hilarious between takes. She has a mixture of songs from old and new from her new cd at the time of this taping. They are really good songs. My favorites were Consider Me Gone and And Still (old one). She showcases her vocals with Strange, Consider Me Gone, Why Not Tonight, Why haven't I heard from you and I want a Cowboy.
Reba sings with such emotion in all of her songs especially the ballads. This is a must have if you are a fan of Reba. The question and answer parts are in full detail so you will enjoy that too. This was taped at Studio A at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tennessee. She also performed on the Opry that night after the taping. This was taped on May 9, 2009.",1306713600,5,932,3.9893048128342246
5467520,5,B00AQ0LCM4,"I have never seen anything of Reba's I didn't enjoy.
Same with this product.  I was entertained all the way through.
I will probably watch it again with my Texas relatives when
they come here for vacation. And maybe in the fall. And again
a couple of times next year.
I like Miss Reba and was glad to add this to my collection.
