6805645,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"I *braced* myself to see this film, as I did before seeing Hotel Rwanda: expecting to feel shredded and battered and guilt-ridden. This movie was NOTHING like that: it was tasteful, hopeful, clear and empowering. It was clear and eye-opening about the extent of the problem of trafficking, without being titillating. Furthermore, it was hopeful: showing how ordinary men and women can and DO make a difference.

If there is a tool to put in the hands of the everyday American to turn the tide against human trafficking, this is a sharp one.",1421452800,3,540,4.806451612903226
6805646,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"Let's be honest -- movies about subjects like Human Trafficking aren't exactly your easy-breezy Cover Girl type of movies.  If you're picking this movie up it's because you want to know more, you want to be inspired, and you want to know that making a difference is possible.  This movie does all that --  weaving stories that make your heart ache, with people who are making a real difference all while inspiring us, as the audience, to be more connected and conscious about the lives we're living.  I applaud David Trotter and his team for making this film and mission a priority for humanity. It's time to take care of this issue, that's why it's rising to the surface. It's time for us to do something.",1421452800,,706,4.579365079365079
6805647,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"This is a very eye opening documentary!  For the many that are unfamiliar with the human trafficking issues we have in America, this film brings awareness to this growing crime.  The stories of the victims are heart-breaking, but the hope they have found through the work of the featured abolitionists is inspiring!  You can't help but want to become involved in some way to fight human trafficking!",1420675200,2,399,4.925373134328358
6805648,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"Beautifully filmed and finished. The victim centric theme of this Human Trafficking documentary is eye-opening and desperately needed. It is a great showcase of how residential recovery and treatment programs are conceived and put into reality across the country. The revelation that tens of thousands of human sex trafficking victims are American citizens, born and raised here is incredibly valuable. This is not just a Human Rights problem in other parts of the globe. It's an increasingly desperate problem here. Individuals can make a tremendous impact in their communities for this victim population and there are successful examples in this film.

I strongly recommend this documentary as it is accurate, eye opening and very well done. If you are looking for films or information on how human trafficking victims are identified and recovered in the United States, this is for you.",1420675200,16,888,5.297872340425532

6805709,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"This movie shook my world.  I am so grateful to Natalie Grant for funding this project.  More and more you hear hints in our popular culture about the travesty of Sex Trafficking, but many assume it happens elsewhere, and the women involved are foreign.  This movie fleshes out the issues with real faces and real stories and real facts about what is going on right around us in our own neighborhoods, In Plain Sight.  It lovingly and compassionately shares the life stories of many American girls and women who have been tragically crushed under the bondage of sex slavery, from as young as three-years-old, but have found redemption and are taking on the hard work of the restorative healing process.  It also tells the story of six women who are modern-day Joan Of Arcs, against all odds, without previous experience or academic titles, founding homes where they can safely house and nurture these younger women back to emotional health.  Many of the trafficked women have never experienced the loving safety of a functional family home, so these Safe Houses provide them a place to experience what true love looks like, and how functional relationships work.  With that foundation, these women can slowly recover and establish a new life, with new skills to support themselves, new memories of loving, protective relationships, and emotional tools to battle the inner demons that sex-abuse and extreme trauma create.  BUY SEVERAL EXTRA COPIES TO GIVE AWAY!  I keep a couple in my car so I have them with me anytime the topic comes up.",1430438400,4,1538,4.9073359073359075

They are rescuing young women and men who want to find freedom.  It is  interesting to note that the cities where these abolitionists are working are major cities that are considered ""normal"" yet this dark side of sex trafficking is drowning the victims and they need help.  This documentary shows how the love of the body of Christ can transform young women who have no hope.  They give a new life to these young women so they can learn to live a better life and use the skills that will give them the confidence to move beyond this tragic life.

6805717,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"By sharing what six ordinary women are doing to reach out to women in need of rescue and the love of Jesus to restore hope and healing into their lives, In Plain Sight gives an honest look at what ordinary people can do in the face of a overwhelming crisis and make a difference.

Informative, heartbreaking, encouraging, empowering, and challenging, In Plain Sight: Stories of Hope and Freedom will open your eyes to what is going on in the world around you and motivate you to take action.

This documentary would be excellent to show in churches, home fellowships, senior high youth groups, and bible studies. The more informed and aware we are of the problem the better prepared we are as the Church to take a stand on behalf of those who are being vicitimized as well as pray for an end (and take positive steps toward making changes) to those things which drive this industry in the first place.

Human trafficking is a serious problem which hits more closely to home than you may realize. Watch this movie, educate yourself, go to the website and learn about the resources and ministries available, and ask God to show you what to do to help set the captives free and make a tangible difference in someone's life.",1425340800,2,1220,4.612903225806452

This documentary is used to help raise awareness of sex trafficking going on. This film is rated PG-13. It is advised you watch this film before showing your children, to decide if it is suited for them to view. Watch this film to learn more about what is going on In Plain Sight and see stories of hope and freedom. Pray God will bring more people to help these victims and help them and bring them to Christ.

6805731,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"In Plain Sight stories of Hope and Freedom is a moving, sad, but a movie full of hope. It talks about sex trafficking, but not in other 3rd world countries, but here in the U.S. Not just in big cities, but in rural and small areas everywhere.
  Here are some facts for you to read:
Over 80 percent of victims in 2011 confirmed sex trafficking cases in this country were American citizens. 80% of sex trafficking victims are women and girls and up to 50% are minors .
90% of prostituted women have been physically abused as children .
70% of sex trafficking is linked to organized crime .
75% of prostituted women have attempted suicide.
The average age for girls trafficked into prostitution in the US is 12-14.
 A pimps yearly income is around $632,000.
Some of the names of the homes these ladies opened to help the victims are:
Courage Worldwide
Hope for Justice
Redeemed Ministries
P.A.T.H
The Samaritan Woman
Traffick911
These homes are such peaceful, beautiful places for the victims to live in while they learn how to take care of themselves and heal. All of the homes have a strong Biblical base and are free with no expectations for the women and girls. Their job is just to heal and learn that there is good out there.
  This film is such an important one and we all need to help in any way we can. Dont just close your ears and shut your eyes to this trafficking, but help. Go to the movie site and see what all you can do to help.
  I highly recommend this movie for the things it can tell us that are happening right where we live. We cant sit in silence anymore.

It was so wonderful to see how God touched the hearts of the rescuers and the people who opened up homes to care for the victims they saw as their own daughters/ family. Kudos to David Trotter and Natalie Grant for their work in this film and all that they continue to produce in how-to materials, inspiring spiritual music and their latest podcast.

6805734,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"Several years ago, I had an idea to write stories focusing on a largely misunderstood and underestimated problem in our nation: Sex trafficking. In my idea, the heroes were those who would rescue girls from the streets, and the heroines were the girls who struggled for freedom. I saw the stories as a spin on the Underground Railroad. And this past year, I have heard of Operation Underground Railroad, a group that goes into foreign lands to rescue girls from the sex slave trade,  In Plain Sight, a documentary on the sex slave trade in the United States which featured several homes that I would say are the likeness of my story ideas.

For me, this is both confirmation that this issue is on the heart of God and that it is an underestimated problem in our nation. One day, I may get to write a series of stories. One day, maybe I can serve them in more physical ways. For now, however, I can invite you to get hold of the film In Plain Sight narrated by Natalie Grant, and share it with your friends, churches, schools, and whomever else you can find who will listen. Our neighborhoods are screaming for attention and compassion. Lets unstop our ears and open our hearts to their cries.

6805736,5,B00PHFWCIQ,In Plain Sight is an eye opener for sure. I have seen women walking streets but never thought that they may be trafficked. I did not even know what that meant before watching this movie. I had always assumed these women chose to do that type of work. Then I think who would chose to do that? I know women who have worked the streets and every one of them had a pimp. These pimps are the normal guys with families that you might see at the store. You would not ever guess the dirty work that brings the family groceries home. The women he is using to make him money. It is horrible when you think about it. Sorry I can get carried away with this topic because it hits close to home. I have been close to it. This documentary is a great way to help everyone know how to help stop trafficking.,1423180800,,790,4.103225806451613
6805737,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"IN PLAIN SIGHT does what many other documentaries and news stories do: it enlightens us to a significant problem in American society--in this case human trafficking.  However, it also accomplishes a different purpose.  Unlike many productions along these lines, which seem content to explore the depravity and darkness inherent in this world, IN PLAIN SIGHT offers the hope that comes through the concerted efforts of those who are ministering to the victims of human trafficking.  Thus, the viewer is left with hopefulness for what can be and is being done about this horrific issue in our culture.  The six ministries profiled come alongside these women, treating them as precious people made in God's image, love them, counsel them, and work to help turn their lives around.  In this, there is joy that breaks through in the midst of the darkness and depravity of this world as they shine as ""light in the darkness.""  I highly recommend this movie to those who want to minister in a manner that embraces the hope of the gospel while not burying their heads in the sand about the utter depravity that permeates this world.

6805759,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"In Plain Sight is difficult to watch because the film captivates your soul disallowing you to do nothing.  It's real, heart-wrenching and unexpected.  The victims are articulate and open and have dreams and goals...these young ladies are our daughters, our sisters, our girlfriends and slavery is taking place in our backyard.  There is a thread amongst these ladies consisting of  abuse and neglect from an early age, mostly from family members and if we are to remain a great nation, we have to protect our children and strengthen the family unit and stop the vicious cycle.  There are many ways to help: asssist the safe homes for these victims through your time or monies, become a foster home and providing nurturing and safety and a sense of normalcy for our abused children, take notice of your surroundings and report suspicious behavior to local authorities, or simply view this impactful film and share it with others.
The featured women in this film who have dedicated their lives to helping the victims of sex slavery should be applauded!  They have made huge personal sacrifices to bring these ladies in to protect and nurture and educate, as their own daughters, and have a contentment and joy exuding from each of them.",1422748800,2,1234,4.908653846153846

This film not only shares personal stories of sex trafficking but also shows how some of these victims have been able to find hope and healing from this lifestyle.

Professionally filmed, the stories of these women need to be heard by anyone and everyone who has the least inclination towards seeing wrong made right.  It taught me to see these dear ones as victims, not criminals.  Trafficking should not be tolerated in our society.  Open and on the streets, typically, in the third world, yet just as rampant in America, only hidden and subtle.  The money that changes hands in the world of pimping these girls is shocking.

I love the way the story of the abolitionist and ladies in recovery were told in first person. The ladies in recovery were frank about their stories but showed hope for he future. The documentary really highlighted that this is not just an issue overseas but right here in the US. Those not already familiar with the documentary were astounded by what they learned. The most common statement I heard afterwards was, ""I thought the women were from overseas, now I know that most are actually our own US citizens...our own kids"".

In Plain Sight is a revealing and informative documentary that features the wonderful work of six female abolitionists in six different cities (Baltimore, Sacramento, Dallas, Houston, Little Rock, Nashville) fighting against sex trafficking in the United States. The film aims to make viewers aware of this urgent, horrendous problem that is taking place all over America ""in plain sight"" at hotels, truck stops, massage parlors, etc. Slavery still exists in America! Did you know that 100,000 children and thousands more women are sold in the United States for sex each year? Did you know that the average age of victims is 12-14? In the film, you will hear heart-wrenching interviews given by victims/survivors of sex trafficking. They endured hellish ""nightmares"" and unimaginable abuses & oppression. The common thread among the victims is neglect and sexual abuse at a very young age. The traffickers/predators prey on these children's vulnerability.

The film also tells the beautiful stories of hope, freedom, and restoration as each survivor shares how she has been helped and cared for through a sex trafficking aftercare home. The girls feel loved & safe and are able to relax and heal. The aftercare homes run by the six female abolitionists provide the girls with shelter, recovery program, life skills, and much more. I highly recommend this excellent documentary (executive produced & narrated by Natalie Grant) to anyone. Human trafficking/sex trafficking must be stopped! We can be part of its solutions.

It really shows that anyone can make a difference with this issue. We hosted a screening on a collage campus and had over 100 collage kids come out and view the documentary. Afterwards, we had such positive feedback and people left feeling motivated to do something and make an impact!

A must see!!!",1421884800,,416,5.028985507246377
6805784,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"In Plain Sight is a well made documentary focused on six female abolitionists who have answered the call to step out into a messy world and fight against sex trafficking here in the United States. I enjoyed hearing the vastly different stories of how God called these women to get involved in this fight and what their obedience has done to bless women and children who are victims to this crime.

6805785,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"Narrated by Natalie Grant who also co-executive produced with David Trotter, In Plain Sight: Stories of Hope and Freedom, features six modern-day abolitionists, along with some of the women who have been rescued from a life of prostitution and sexual abuse. The statistics continue to shock me, but the greatest impact is made by the stories of the victims themselves. Many were sexually abused as children and grew up believing that they were undeserving of any other life style. There has been a growing awareness in recent years that human trafficking is not just happening ""somewhere else"", but is a growing industry here in the United States.

But, more than just a documentary about the tragedy of human trafficking, In Plain Sight, offers HOPE and HEALING. Each of the safe places featured understand that there are trust issues and the need to just simply breathe for a while. Even more poignant to me than watching the faces of the women who agreed to be interviewed, was watching their hands. Their hands expressed more than their words could convey. This is a great DVD to help bring awareness of the issue of human trafficking, and, more importantly, it provides ideas of ways YOU can make a difference.

6805786,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"Hard to believe when you think of sex trafficking, you would think it happens in countries like India, Africa, China, or Cambodia. But its not. Over 80% of the sex trafficking is occurring in the United States with 100,000 children and even thousands more women being sold into trafficking rings. The average age of children are between 12 and 14 years of age. It is appalling when you think that in hotels, motels, truck stops and spas this is happening all around us right where we live. You might think it is only happening in larger cities like New York, Los Angeles or Las Vegas but victims have been rescued in all 50 states in big cities and small ones. Do you really know what is going on in your own city?

By definition sex trafficking is a commercial sex act induced by fraud, force or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age. Any minor engaged in a commercial sexual act is considered a trafficking victim regardless of whether force, fraud or coercion is involved. In other words there is no such thing as a child prostitute, he or she is a trafficking victim. So how is this even happening in America?

Most of the time patterns emerge that shows most victims were neglected or sexually abused at a very young age. These patterns continue as the victims grow confused over what is normal in their lives. They soon find sex gives them attention they need as well as money to finance other needs like drugs or alcohol because they don't understand that this is not a normal life for a young man or woman. They always feel as if they never had a choice. It usually starts with abusive parents, sexual abuse with a friend or relative when they are very young, usually 4 or 5; they are in and out of foster care; once they are a victim they are likely to be victimized again. They are likely to put themselves in those situations again, not intentionally meaning to be the child's fault. They become runaways, They are usually from homes where domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse, These applied to every single victim regardless of race, ethnicity or background. The differences is in third world country is it is out on the street, in the open, where in the United States we are really good at keeping it hidden and covering up that this is happening. The number one trait found in all victims is vulnerability, in which traffickers use this to meet the unmet needs in a women or child I was preying upon.  This is why 1 in 3 runaways are approached within 48 hours of being on the streets by a sex trafficker.

Most of us would look away due to complexity of the problem but still others rise up to take action, like the six female abolitionists highlighted in this documentary produced and narrated by Natalie Grant, In Plain Sight. Jeanne Allert, Founder and Executive Director of The Samaritan Women in Baltimore, Maryland; Jenny Williamson, Founder and CEO of Courage Worldwide in Sacramento, CA; Deanna Graves, Founder and Executive Director of Traffick 911 in Dallas, TX; Louise Allison, Founder and Director of P.A.T.H. Partners Against Trafficking Humans in Littlerock, Arkansas; Bobbie Mark, Co-Founder and Director of Redeemed in Houston, Texas; Stacia Freeman, US Director for Hope for Justice in Nashville, Tennessee. Learn how these women made a difference in their cities and how they are impact the lives of sex trafficking victims in a positive way.

I received In Plain Sight compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own. This is such a powerful documentary and one I think everyone adult needs to watch. There are warning signs we all need to pay attention to and be aware that this is happening all over the United States, quite possibly in the very city we are living in currently. It is designed not just to inform but to empower and motivate people to take action in their own community as a way of preventing this from continuing. This is a preventable crime but it takes the contribution of everyone to make it work and to put an issue to open our eyes to what's is happening in plain sight. I easily give this one a 5 out of 5 stars.",1421712000,11,4271,4.607095926412615
6805787,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"This film can be, understandably, difficult to watch.  It is not graphic, but soul wrenching to hear the stories of humans treated like commodities.  But the thing you will hear in this film, the undercurrent, is hope.  For change, for a new life for these victims, for new language regarding their position.  These girls (and other trafficked people), are victims, in need of help, in need of a way out.  This film highlights people and places who are working to do just that.  It gives you an opportunity to realize every single person can DO something to abolish modern slavery.",1421625600,,581,4.76

8687974,5,B00PHFWCIQ,This documentary was very informative and really shows the issue of sex trafficking throughout the United States.  The strength of various people throughout this film are highlighted and it was impressive to see the effect they made on those affected by sex trafficking.  These individuals who supported victims of sex trafficking sensed a calling by God to work with these victims to help them recover from the many horrors they experienced.,1490140800,,442,5.211267605633803
8687975,5,B00PHFWCIQ,"Very good information.  I think every person should watch this to understand what's going on in our country.  I've read a lot of books on the subject of human trafficking and this does a pretty good job.  If we want to end it, then everyone needs to be aware of it at the very least.  We need more awareness campaigns and start trying to end the demand and fix the damage that is/has been done to the victims. Todays culture has done a lot of this to our society and desensitized  people.  If this DVD doesn't make you want to do something, then read ""Renting Lacy"" and/or ""In Our Backyard""; also another one, but a tough read is ""Not for Sale"".  I like the last one because it mentions Strip Clubs.  Where I live a lot of them are just places to find Buyers/demand and are set up right next to motels so the girls can be victimized and their pimp gets more money.  Most books don't mention Strip Clubs and what really goes on in them. This documentary is a good start and really shows the victims' suffering and long term trauma.  I'm thank God for the people that produced this and pray for their continued success.  We need more people like the ones that made this DVD. I plan to buy more and pass them out every chance I get.  I'm currently joining up with a group in our area.  I will pray that many many more will do the same.  Yes, it's a very good Documentary.",1486598400,,1368,4.231660231660232
