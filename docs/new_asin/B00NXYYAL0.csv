There are line, moments and scenes that were both amazing and hilarious. The people who made this movie clearly had great love for American action movies and did everything they could to bring that feeling to the forefront. Dont miss this one!",1531526400,,362,4.5

8681029,2,B00NXYYAL0,"I expected more from a tribute to Rambo, but Rambu falls way short of mediocre.  The fight choreography is lame--more like the three stooges than
chuck Norris.  Acting is less than you would expect in a B-movie.  The plot, there must have been one, flowed like molasses in January.",1506729600,,281,4.6938775510204085
