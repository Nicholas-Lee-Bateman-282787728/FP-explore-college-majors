208339,4,6300133737,"The minute this movie starts with a long shot of a lake and the hilariously bad rockabilly/swingin' song ""I Was a Teenage Zombie"" (by the Fleshtones), you know you're in for a treat. There is a Mexican pimp selling some bad weed, and he is just amazing. In one scene, he rips a guy's face off and says, ""Yeah, I'm the weedman! I got some WEED!"" I was rolling on the floor laughing. One of the characters changes into a baseball uniform JUST to hit another character in the head with a baseball bat and then changes back in the next shot. It's all very humorous. I'm guessing the people who gave this a bad rating were expecting a Fulci classic or something.",1072483200,3,657,4.349593495934959
208340,5,6300133737,"There are valuable lessons to be learned here, all you wannabe future hollywood directors/writers:
The dumb blonde girl who is always walking into trees- a must. Students who can carry on a five minute conversation during class without the teacher realizing- you know it.
The fact that one of the characters has glasses on in one shot, and then from the other camera angle, the glasses are missing- hilarious.
heads flying off- gotta have it.
actors straight out of some high school film club- smart move.
The point is, these movies make us laugh and cost a bare minimal to the producers/investors. Keep em coming, I hope that this review will inspire future directors who are considering tackeling the horror field. My advice, forget the Scream and Final Destination glossy [stuff], and bring back the cheese!",1057881600,5,810,4.963235294117647
208341,2,6300133737,"When some teenagers accidentlly kills a drug dealer, they dump his corpse in a polluted river and toxic chemicals turns the corpse in to an murderous zombie. And the undead drug dealer starts to kill the ones that originally killed him while the surviving teenagers tries to find out how to make the living dead dead again. A bit crappy, but fans of The Return Of The Living Dead movies may like it. Should problably please any average zombie fan.",1012348800,,447,4.6
208342,5,6300133737,This movie empitomizes cheezy horror! Mooselini's character was hilarious. Nothing beats the heads flying! 2 points for this movie!! It's right up there next to Return to Horror High.  Anyone who was a teenager should buy this movie NOW!,970272000,5,237,5.076923076923077
208343,1,6300133737,"If you want to see a really bad horror movie, get this one!  The only redeaming quality is Ms. Faithful played believingly by Cassie Madden.  It's fun to watch if you don't take it to seriously and want to have a good  laugh.  Great for parties!",953164800,,245,4.260869565217392

7802808,5,6300133737,I've liked this movie (especially the cover artwork) for years and it's by far one my favorite zombie films!  Lots of good gore scenes and a plot that is quite over-the-top...,1396656000,,175,4.645161290322581
7802809,5,6300133737,"I was a Teenage Zombie is a humorous, extremely low budget 80s horror comedy film.  Don't expect amazing cinematography or oscar winning acting but do expect a good time.  The actors and crew did the best with the money they had and all in all they made a enjoyable little film.  It plays like a dopey 80s comedy mixed with a spoof of horror films from the 50s and 60s (with buckets of low budget gory special effects).  The pricetag may be a bit expensive for this DVD but in my opinion its worth it.  The quality of the picture on the DVD is a bit better than the VHS but it still could use another DVD release with some special features, and better picture quality.

If you're a fan of troma movies, mystery science theater, or cheesy low budget horror give this flick a watch, its good stuff.",1304380800,,796,4.308724832214765
7802810,5,6300133737,"I remember the first time I saw this when I was little I thought it was a good movie but of course I always loved those cheesy horror flicks and my mom would get so mad at me for watching it cause of some sexual activity going on and she thought I was too young for that.
So for years and years I never got to watch it again til it came on t.v. one night and I watched it and relived alot of good memories from watching it before and this time I didn't watch it around my mom and even though I am old enough to watch stuff like that she still gets a bit upset with me.",1247097600,,568,3.7416666666666667
7802811,4,6300133737,"This movie was pretty good. I'm a big fan of the 80's horror/slasher movies,but then again I like to watch a funny 80's horror movie here & there. But any ways to sum it all up. THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE.",1203120000,,199,3.8780487804878048
7802812,5,6300133737,"This movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder!  I didn't realize, when I purchased this DVD, that it was going to be a total amateurish delight!  I mean the editing is even horrible, the sound doesn't match up!  The acting is atrocious!  The storyline is pathetic!  I LOVE IT!  There's a scene where the Hispanic, zombie, drug-dealer rapes a hapless teenage girl to death!  He breaks her body in half and all she says is ""You can't do thaaaaaaaaaat!""  In another hilarious scene a cop, who is hot on the trial of the zombie drug peddler, gets punched in the forehead and sort of has a 2 second delayed reaction to the pain.  Then he falls backward and screams like a dying duck!  Oh, I'm telling you buy this movie!  If you love watching horrible actors not totally devoted to their parts, this one is for you!",1142121600,5,817,4.416107382550336
7802813,5,6300133737,"I was a teenage zombie...when i purchased this movie i didn't know what to expect...I was EXTREMELY IMPRESSED, the movie is funny and it has mild gore (due to image entertainment's editing crew). I would highly recommend buying this movie if you have some extra cash, if u like movies like Evil Dead 2, Bad Taste, or Evil Ed this is definatly one to put in your collection. Anyways to let you know all horror films i've bought that image entertainment has released has cut out a lot of the gore scenes. I probably would next expect to see this movie re-released by a different company due to lack of popularity and peoples lack of humor.",1121126400,2,637,4.5
