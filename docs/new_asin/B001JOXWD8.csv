3658943,5,B001JOXWD8,I fell in love with this movie as a kid. I'm so glad that I found it on DVD so now my kids and family can enjoy  this beautiful movie.,1302652800,,134,3.466666666666667
3658944,5,B001JOXWD8,"This is one of my favorite Christmas Movies and I have been waiting a long time for it to be available.  I paid a little more then I wanted to and wish it was cheaper, but the movie was brand new and very rare to find.  I wish someone would put A Very Brady Christmas on DVD :)",1294185600,,277,3.7586206896551726
3658945,3,B001JOXWD8,"The story follows a young girl, Jessica, whose mother died years ago. She envies the others girls who have moms to take them shopping and talk about girl things. At a department store wishing well she encounters an ""employee"" (played by Doris Roberts) who is more likely an angel of some sort. She helps Jessica get her wish to have a Mom for Christmas. She sends mannequin-turned-human Amy (Olivia Newton-John) to Jessica's home, where she poses as the housekeeper Jessica's father was intending to hire. There is some humor as you see Amy adjust to being human. Of course, Jessica's father begins to fall for the beautiful stranger, but she causes some major chaos in their lives. She is only supposed to be there for the holiday, and when she has complicated things by causing a fire, being picked up for suspected shoplifting and embarrassing Jessica in front of friends, she decides they would be better off without her and returns to the department store. When it is discovered that she has left them they set off to try and get her back, but can they overcome the magic that was only to work for Christmas?

When my children were young we had taped this from the TV and frequently enjoyed it over the holidays. As they got older it was a little too corny for them. But if your kids are young it is a good family Christmas fantasy, with a little romance thrown in. I think Doris Roberts turns in the strongest performance, but my favorite scene is in the department store after hours when Amy is trying to get her mannequin friend to drive a car that is on display so that they can go get a Christmas tree. They have a funny encounter with a security guard.",1279065600,2,1663,4.524916943521594
3658946,5,B001JOXWD8,"When i first saw this movie, back when it was on tv on the disney channel, i then became obsessed with finding this brilliant film on VHS or DVD again.

my thoughts of this film is this.

Even in the midths of economic hardship that most americans see in their lives, it just goes to show you that this movie was (in it's time) and still is the best of movie making out there.  it shows that with love, understanding and hope, one can have anything happen.  even within the smile of stranger (a mall-doll or not).  this movie gives its viewers reasons to reflect upon their own lives, i know i did.  to find the best in it, despite the darkened policies and decisions that our government hands us.  this film is about hope, in the finding of that innocence within a child, renewed faith, in the belief that if one wants it bad enough, it comes to pass, and in the belief, that within hard work, love, believing in ones self, nearly anything is possible.

these days we as a world, lack that. we spend our lives with the scurry and worry of everyday life.  when see the ones on street corners holding up those signs (and you ALL know what im talking about..  ya'll seen them too) we pay them no mind, we brush them off as if they were as common as the trash that lays along the curb in the street.  we close our minds and hearts to each other. we have become complacient and self centered and yes, even the holy rollers are this way, sometimes even more so.  but if you see this film, look at the message, look at the presence and look at the love that is so deseperately apparent in this movie.

every child without a mother, longs for such a fairytale such as this to come true for themselves.  they too, as did jessica, wish with their heart, wish with their love and wished with the innocence of childhood for the mother they so long for in life. its rings true as does the poem from the NYC Post ""Yes, Virginia, There Is A Santa Claus"".  however, now a days, that kind of magic, that kind of miracle, that kind of fairytale, is mere hollywood magic.

i think this film SHOULD BE A MUST for any family, struggling internally or not, a must for teaching their children about life, about love and especially about hope.",1266796800,,2220,4.300480769230769

3658959,5,B001JOXWD8,"I do love the movie. I taped it via VHS from TV back in the '90's and have been looking for it ever since, but I agree with the other reviewer; $30-40 is extremely unreasonable for this made-for-TV type movie. Why so much -- does anyone know? The Hallmark movies don't cost near this much. My VHS copy is just about worn out & I would like to replace it with the DVD, but not until the price comes down. I dearly love Olivia Newton-John, but all actors in this movie do a wonderful job! Yes, also love the music!",1449619200,,512,4.13

3659002,3,B001JOXWD8,"First of all, you can get this DVD cheap through the Disney Movie Club.  Second of all, why bother?

At worst, this is a lame fantasy complete with magic and lessons to be learned (not the least of which is why you don't put lighted candles on a Christmas tree!).  It's earnest but a tad too simplistic.  Life just doesn't work like this and why should it?  You want a new mom, get your dad to start dating, don't go wishing on a dummy in a store.  (Which brings up the movie's biggest question: why was this little girl spending every waking moment loitering in a department store?)

Not exactly a timeless tale worth repeating.",1356739200,,629,4.417391304347826

Features a very excellent song written and recorded with ex-Shadows John Farrar which is deliberately messed around with by the movie owners to stop would be pirate copies being made by ONJ fans.- one plausible explanation?

Strictly speaking only for ONJ complete-ists.

Useful if you bought the VHS copy years ago and now want an upgrade to DVD format. But don't expect a blu-ray version (unlike Grease and Xanadu etc)

The basic premise of a lonely child who has lost their mom, wishing they could have one for Christmas, is a timeless idea that even my youngest could understand and sympathize with.  The twist is that ""Amy"" the Christmas Wish mom, is actually a department store mannequin who comes to life and become's the family's housekeeper.  Of course, not having a human past or upbringing, Amy doesn't always get things right. ( like knowing what's appropriate to serve as food ) Which just adds to the hilarity of the story.  Despite the awkwardness of these moments, everyone falls in love with Amy... only to find out she's destined to turn back into a mannequin at the stroke of midnight on Christmas Eve. Which sets off a desperate effort by her adoptive family to save her from that fate.  I can honestly say that my wife & kids loved it !",1483401600,2,1008,4.541436464088398

8313249,5,B001JOXWD8,"My wife and I love Christmas movies and, over the years, we've collected DVDs of several hundred films from early silent Christmas Carols to much more recent releases. So, if you're thinking of ordering this movie -- consider whether you enjoy the basic Christmas genre: That's pretty much a bit of snow, a bit of magic, a bit of music swirling around a family with painful problems, ensuring that everything works out happy as the holiday unfolds.

This film was produced by Disney for television in 1990, so a decade after Olivia Newton-John starred in Grease and Xanadu, and four years before she was back with another popular Christmas movie:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Romance/dp/B005CFBZC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Romance</a>&nbsp;Those of us who have enjoyed her career as a singer and an occasional actor have to admit that she's at her best in movies where it's all about the fun. That certainly was the case with Grease and these two Christmas movies.

The magic that unfolds in this particular movie has so many logical gaps that viewers really do need to suspend their skepticism. After all, the plot involves department store mannequins coming to life--and their secret desire to become real people. The rules about how this particular form of magic works very quickly get jumbled up. But, hey, this is Disney! It's Christmas! This is fun. Relax and enjoy!

A few disclaimers: Olivia Newton-John does sing in this film, but that's not the best reason to order this movie. This doesn't feature a hit, in other words. Also, this was shot for television before current computer-generated effects were available. So, a few of the magical moments are -- well, they're classic 1990s TV effects. Also, if you're thinking of this movie because you're a Doris Roberts fan (and my wife and I do consider ourselves Roberts' fans) -- then you should know that she's only a small part of this feature. Yes, she's there, but she's not as prominent as she is in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Miracle/dp/B003Z94WC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs. Miracle</a>&nbsp;I list these disclaimers while also saying -- we loved it, nevertheless.
