8128795,3,B000G1R3YO,"I'm a big fan of Michael Moore, and after seeing Captalism, A Love Story, I was inspired to see more of his work which I hadn't yet seen. When I learned about the awful Truth, it sounded quite good, but after watching only 2 or 3 episodes, I just wasn't very impressed, both with the format and content. One of the episodes was,IMO, better than the others and was kind of worth seeing, but I was not inspired to watch the rest, at this time. I might return to it for the remainder because Michael is generally so good.",1352505600,,518,4.242424242424242
8128796,5,B000G1R3YO,"...so I'm always glad to see it get continued attention. But what about ""TV Nation""? Before we repackage ""The Awful Truth"" again, let's see a DVD release of Moore's NBC/Fox show from the mid-90s. Talk about groundbreaking. I remember the first time I watched it, I couldn't believe I was actually hearing these types of viewpoints on broadcast television. It actually gave me brief hope that maybe the networks weren't all corporate monoliths with no room for truly progressive perspectives. Alas, it didn't last long.",1156982400,8,518,5.105882352941176
