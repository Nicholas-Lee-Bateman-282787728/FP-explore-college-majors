416538,4,6302025303,"The movie ""Butterflies are Free"" is a comedy/drama which is an old  favorite of mine that I have seen in various forms on TV and video for a number of years. I am very happy now that it has finally been put out on DVD.This is basically a filmed play (with a couple of added scenes to ""open it up"")which explores the meaning of concepts like freedom and independence within the framework of a love story. The story takes place in a San Fransisco loft during those heady, 'groovy' days of flower power. Don Baker (Played by Edward Albert) is young man, blind from birth, who is trying for the first time to break away from his overbearing mother's apron strings by living on his own. One day he meets his new neighbor, Jill, a young, commitment free hippie and wanna-be actress. At first she is freaked out by Don's blindness, but soon they are ""getting it on"" and she spends the night. The next morning their little private, three room Eden is invaded, when Don's mother barges in unannounced, with the intention of taking her son home. It is within this scenerio that the three characters shout, argue and pontificate about such concepts as 'freedom', 'independence', 'commitment','love' and finally 'letting go'.They all learn a little bit about themselves and the changes they must make to get on with their lives. This is really a wonderful, funny movie that has a lot of heart. The three lead actors do a simply amazing job with their roles. Goldie Hawn is in all her giggly, post ""Laugh-In"" splendor. Underneath the bubbly persona she shows us a character, who is emotionally crippled and must learn not to be frightened of being loved. Edward Albert does a fine job as the blind, young man who is fighting for his independence. But the real scene stealer is Eileen Heckart (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this role)who is brilliantly funny as an overbearing, cynical, mother,who obviously loves her son, but must find a way to let go. The script by Lenord Gershe is very fast and funny featuring hilarious exchanges between Albert, Hawn and Heckart's characters. It is filled with lots of one liners that remind me a bit of the comic style of playright, Neil Simon and his comedies such as ""The Odd Couple"" and ""The Sunshine Boys"".Some of the hippie, flower power references and language in the movie are a bit dated, but I think it adds a touch of charm and quaintness to the script. Milton Katselas's direction of this film is a little stagey, but it does not detract as the story progresses. The DVD presentation is very clear and the sound quality is not bad for a film from 1972. My only real complaint is that the DVD features bonus trailers, but not for this movie (at least two out of three of them are for old Goldie Hawn films).For an evening of funny, yet thought provoking entertainment I highly recommend this film.",1020211200,92,2847,4.637623762376237
416539,4,6302025303,"I first saw this movie many years ago during a frustrating bout w/ insomnia. I had done a book report on the story in high school but never actually read the book. When i caught the movie i was into old fashioned horrors, Bella Lugosi epecially! This very believable, simple love story has stayed with me over the years. I think all the acting was incredible! The simple sets and props are from an innocent era gone by! Not an edge-of-the-seat thriller, not a brain teasin' who dunnit. Just a heartwarming, well-written lesson in love and life! Butterflies Are Free will forever be in my list of favorites!",1013731200,3,606,4.62037037037037

416541,5,6302025303,"I watched Butterflies are Free on cable for the first time this past  weekend.  How did I ever miss this one! It was a very good story, and I  thought the acting all around was outstanding.  It's the story of a blind  man, who is determined to make it on his own, much to the chagrin of his  mother, who is portrayed brilliantly by Eileen Heckart.  She won the Oscar  for Best Supporting Actress for her work here. And along with trying to be  independent, he meets a woman who helps to bring him out into the world,  and discover new things.  Now I knew from the start that Goldie Hawn's  character wasn't going to be completely sympathetic, but I guess you just  have to see the movie to figure that out. The movie had me hook, line, and  sinker.  and I was glued to my couch for the whole thing.  I really enjoyed  this film, and recommend it.",965001600,32,846,4.220125786163522
416542,5,6302025303,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I saw it for the first time yesterday on HBO. Goldie Hawn is hillarious in this movie, and the story is beautiful. If you like Goldie Hawn, and if you like a good,  real love story, you will LOVE this movie.",943660800,8,260,3.9056603773584904
416543,4,6302025303,"Not a bad love story if one doesnt take it too seriously. We tend to forget that Goldie Hawn used to act in some very good movies at one time. She manages to shine in this charming but unoriginal romance between a flower  child and a handsome young blind man played by Edward Albert,seeking  independence from his over protective mother. The story is set in the  Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco during the early seventies prior to  Watergate and gay rights and the onslaught of AIDS.
Eileen Heckart gives  a memorable and touching performance as the mother and well deserved her  best-supporting-actress oscar that year. There is a wonderful scene where  Goldie first meets Donnys mother in his apartment in the most inappropriate  of circumstances. In her underwear! Enough said. Not exactly Shakespeare but  it will keep your interest,and besides theres a happy ending...",936230400,15,878,5.041666666666667

416764,5,6302025303,"This is an enchanting little story based on a theater play.

I never liked Goldie Hawn or a fan of hers. She is a talkative spoiled walcky woman and I didn't liked that. Almost every charactor that she played was exactly the same as her own one.

I rather liked her daughter Kate Hudson. She is adorable make other people happy type of lady.

But in this movie she worked her roll really well.

The truely amazing actor from this movie was Edward Albert, Eileen Heckart who played Edward's mother.

Edward is a blind young man who decides to live alone and movied to this small humble apartment,

Goldie just moved next door. Shee just noticed that Edward is keep peeking at her window all the time. Whenever she changes her dress or whatever she does.

She decides to approach him not knowing that he is blind.

Then she finds out that he is blind. But she also find out how cheerful and positive he is, he fells in love with him.

I mean he falls in love with her more.

Goldie is an WANNA BE actress just about to have a little audition for this silly theater audition that involves all nudity.

Goldie and Edward make love without serious relationship.

But Edward definately falls in love with her.

Then appears his mother saying that she should not involved. She will only make her son's break his heart and leave.

She goes to this audition and has this really silly roll that involves all nude and few dialogue only.

She comes back with the director and deciedes to live with the director just because she is afraid of being involved deeper with Edward.

She is a type of gal that is afraid of deep relationship.

Edward's mother(Eileen Heckart) wants her son to move back to her place.

But he doesn't want. But when he found out that Goldie is leaving, he changed his mind.

But this time his mother urged his son not too. That is the most beautiful moment. Her mother truely loved him.(Eileen Heckart was marvelous)

She said, you decided to move and just because your girl is leaving shouldn't be the reason for you to decide to move back home. You should be strong and stay in this place. I almost cried when the mother delivered that line.

Then Edward said his last line to Goldie. Do you really love the director? If not you shouldn't go. You are just running away cause of me. You are running away cause you are scared.

She leaves but comes back with all of her belongings.

She loves Edward after all.

This is totally a different kind of love story and it is something you wouldn't see every year.

Don't hesitate to find this film from anywhere. It is a bless watching this small movie that has minimal location.",1455062400,,2635,4.450939457202505

416811,5,6302025303,"An indescribably breathtaking, tender film that boasts an equally delicate, flutteringly-pleasing title song.  A blind man repressed by the social constraints of his over-protective mother ventures out on his own and meets a free-spirited, liberal minded woman.  He teaches her how to see with her heart and he teaches her to see past the obvious.  Wonderfully metaphorical, gloriously uplifting, this masterpiece subtly reflects we must guard ourselves against stereotypes.

I love how such serious situations are given a light-hearted treatment and how optimistic the message and ending of the film are.  Goldie is first class and the vocals of Edward Albert on the title song have never been captured with as much melodious melancholy and yet unbreakable hope as he!",1432425600,6,769,5.375

I've always been a Goldie Hawn fan since my mother had introduced me to this
crazy hilarious beautiful actress, in Overboard. So that was why I stayed on the channel
to watch ""butterflies"" all the way through. Goldie is really at the top of her ditzy
blonde game, as Jill. The free loving, bright eyed, bubbly hippie, living next door. Her and Eileen Eckhart's hilarious banter was genius. My 2 faveorite parts were whe Eileen first comes in
and Goldie says she came over to her sons' apt for help zipping up her blouse and Eckhart's charecter smiles and says ""I see....Where is your blouse?"" (As Goldie is only in her bra and panties.) And then Goldie starts dumbly looking aroud the apartment and says ""Let's see...It has to be around here somewhere."" (Trying to act as if she isn't COMPLETELY MORTIFIED!) LOL. The other part is when Don tells his mother that Jill is an actress. And Elieen asks Goldie if she might have seen her in anything? And Jill says she was in a high school play. ""I played yum yum."" Eileen breaks out in an uncontainable burst of laughter and says ""Yes. I'm sure you did..."" LMAO! After watching it on cable so long ago, I've been on a quest to find it. And not until now have I been able to find it on DVD. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Goldie Hawn. Or anyone who is nostalgic for the ""1960's San Fransico Haight Ashbury Hippe flower power times"" WONDERFUL",1394236800,10,1488,4.454212454212454

417093,4,6302025303,"From the stage play of the same name, ""Butterflies Are Free"" is set during the latter years of the hippie movement in San Fransisco (circa 1972). This could be Goldie Hawn's first film since leaving Rowan and Martin's television show ""Laugh-In"", and she does look that young.

The story is set almost exclusively in an apartment where a young man is living away from home for the first time. He has made a deal with his controlling mother: if he can survive for three months alone, then he will stay away from home, or if not, otherwise. He meets the girl in the apartment next door and they quickly become friends just as she learns that he is totally blind.

The girl is Goldie Hawn and is portrayed as slightly flighty. He sizes her up as someone that is afraid of a serious relationship. Butterflies are free, but serious relationships take time and effort to maintain.

The screen play is excellent and portrays the sensitivity of both the boy/girl relationship and the fact that he is blind. And there is plenty of humor, especially when conservative mother visits and finds Goldie running around in her underwear. Eileen Heckart plays mother and won a best-supporting actor award for the part.

417096,5,6302025303,"I know it's shallow, but I just didn't know if I could sit through a 70's movie complete with drab colors, weird wardrobe, and outdated social concepts. My fears were completely unfounded. What a film!

My heart ached for Donny Baker's character, played magnificently by Edward Albert, to find the freedom and love he sought, in spite of the challenge of being born blind and having an well-meaning, but domineering and over-protective mother.

All the more heart-rending is Don's incredible courage and fierce insistence on being treated just like anyone else. Don does not pity himself for his handicap, and he does not want the audience to either, which makes him all the more real and lovable. Don demands to be seen as a person, not as a blind person. In certain scenes, Don's advocacy for equal treatment shows us how sometimes even our kindnesses might be experienced as patronizing. How did actor Edward Albert create a character that ropes you in entirely, and makes you root for him desperately. Not only that, but he is easy on the eyes as well.

The film feels like a stage play with tight attention on the day's events, as well as snappy dialogue between the central characters. Ample tension between Don, his mother Mrs Baker, as well as Mrs. Baker and Don's love interest, played perfectly by Goldie Hawn, keeps you on your toes and hoping for the best, in spite of the agony of the unknown.

If you are feeling slight sorry for yourself, watch Butterflies are Free. I guarantee you, it will put everything in perspective!",1275264000,4,1537,4.7669172932330826

417099,4,6302025303,"This movie is very much of its time, not just with the groovy clothes and all the talk about hippies. The cinematography and acting style all seem very dated. It's basically the stage play in front of a camera--nearly all the action takes place in Don's apartment, and the delivery of the lines is very stage-y. The clever quips are charming but also are very typical of a Broadway play.

However, I still really enjoyed the movie. While it seemed stiff in many ways, the characters are amazingly complex. Don, the young blind man, doesn't just want to be independent of his mother, he wants to be treated like a regular person by everyone. Jill is a free spirit, but her flightiness is a mask for real emotional scars. And even Don's mother who comes off as a stereotype at first grows and changes over the course of the film.

Edward Albert is handsome in a Ken-doll kind of way, and while he's a good actor, he speaks in a very affected way that was occasionally annoying. He's hit or miss at playing blind; he's more convincing in some shots than others. But Goldie Hawn really shines. This film was impossible to find for a long time.

417123,5,6302025303,"This movie ranks high among my favorites of all time. I saw it as a kid on television, and then later on DVD.

Goldie is so adorable and beautiful in this film. She has this wide-eyed innocence about her which few other actresses possess.  It's like she's pretty and sexy, yet she is so innocent and unassuming...she has no idea that she drives men wild! To me, Marilyn Monroe didn't portray that as well as Goldie. She seemed to be trying too hard. I also liked the fact that many of the characters that Goldie has portrayed have ""matured"" as she did. As she reached a certain age, her characters began to mature in some ways (the rich spoiled type of woman or the aging hipster type and so on...depending on the role).

To me, Goldie's character (Jill) is the quintessential hippie chic. While she's very much a free spirit, she also has a very naive and innocent quality about her. I think that this film captures the tail end of the hippie era quite well. This film is so sweet and innocent. I love it!

417125,5,6302025303,"I'd never actually seen this film all the way through, just in bits & pieces on TV over the years. But I picked up a DVD copy recently & watched it last night. I'd been expecting a pleasant, essentially light little film, but there were moments where it was a lot more than that -- I enjoyed it far more than I'd expected, in fact.

I was especially touched by the early scene where Don (Edward Albert) is touching Jill's (Goldie Hawn's) face, to ""see"" what she looks like. As he caresses her face and hair, she gently take his hand & guides to her breast & murmurs ""This is my breast."" This leads to the two of them going to bed for the first time.

What struck me about that scene, which is remarkably tender, vulnerable, and truly erotic, is that it really conveys the power of sexuality -- not just the physical aspect, lovely & exciting as that is, but the emotional aspect, the wonder & mystery of two people finding that special moment of communion, ""becoming one flesh,"" as they say. I couldn't help but compare it to the extremely casual & commodified way sex is portrayed today, without depth, quite often lacking that almost sacred sense of wonder & mystery I mentioned. It's sex as union, sharing & oneness, rather than just satisfying an urge.

Yes, the film is of its time, but the issues & questions presented aren't dated in the least. When does the pursuit of freedom become a flight from commitment? When does love & well-meaning protection become smothering? Every generation faces these same questions.

The three leads are uniformly excellent, with Eileen Heckart definitely deserving of her Oscar. Her protrayal of Mrs. Baker is rich & dimensional, far from the cardboard villain she might easily have been in lesser hands. Edward Albert is just right as Don, convincingly blind, depicting someone who's trying just a little too hard to be cheerful & self-confident, his face betraying naked pain & despair when love takes a cruel turn. And Goldie Hawn is a warm, bubbly, smarter-than-she-looks Jill, playing carefree while letting her fears & insecurities come through strongly.

I hesitated about giving five stars, as it's clearly not a ""great"" film -- but as a slice of a particular time, a small work of innocence & joy, it couldn't be any better of its kind. It's not for the jaded, certainly, but for those who are willing to accept it on its own terms, it's most rewarding -- and for that reason, highly recommended!",1184457600,14,2446,4.67906976744186

417128,4,6302025303,"""Butterflies Are Free"" is a bit of a time capsule, no question, but an enjoyable one. It's set in the bygone world of late 60's/early 70's San Francisco peace and love, but its central drama has aged far better than its trappings.

In his leading debut, Edward Albert is excellent as Don, a young blind man who has recently moved out on his own for the first time. His new next door neighbor is the lovably flighty Jill (Goldie Hawn), a free-spirited 19-year-old who may or may not have been married and divorced already and who definitely likes to eat (not that you could tell by looking at her). Although first-time director Milton Kaselas did not open the story up much from its stage origins (it leaves the confines of Don's apartment for all of about 15 of its 109 minutes), he did wisely allow Eileen Heckart to reprise her Broadway role as Don's mother. Heckart would go on to win a much-deserved Oscar for her performance in this film. Her character is maternal and progressive at the same time, utterly believable and unique among motherly portrayals in screen history. The balance of mother-son tension keeps the film from being just a simple romantic comedy and/or an after-school special on the strength of the blind and turns it into an engrossing triangular ensemble piece.

As for Goldie: She is, as always, Goldie. For her fans (of which I admit I'm one), that's probably enough, but it's far from all this film has to offer.",1144800000,21,1441,4.669291338582677

An icon film of the seventies.",1128816000,5,377,5.080645161290323
417130,4,6302025303,"There are two things that made me really enjoy seeing this film again for the first time in years. One is Goldie Hawn. She was both terminally cute and utterly adorable in this. The past few years I had mainly seen her in films from the past decade or so, and while she has remained extremely attractive, I didn't remember her in her twenties well enough to realize just how much she and her daughter Kate Hudson resemble one another at the same age (or nearly, since Goldie was 27 when she made this, and Kate is not yet that old). Kate Hudson is a chip off the old block if ever there was one. Goldie Hawn has had a fine career, but I always thought it should have been better than it was. She was a truly gifted comedienne, and one of the cutest women to ever walk the earth. Perhaps her sixties connection with LAUGH IN kept people from taking her seriously for many years, but she definitely should have been in more major projects. Even if everything in this film were bad, just being able to gaze at her extraordinary smile and riveting blue eyes would be enough.
A second thing that makes this film click is the remarkable Eileen Heckart. One of the premiere stage actors of her generation, the husky voiced, long-faced Heckart simply never found her place in the movies. While she managed a great stage career, many of us didn't have the privilege of living in New York so as to see her perform. One advantage of the movies is the ability for talented performers to display their talents in every godforsaken corner of the glove. Heckart is stellar as Don's overprotective mother, and it is an utter joy to hear her squeeze out a put down or insult. She won a well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in this one.
I am not overly fond of the rest of the film. The problem is that this isn't really a movie: it is a play captured on celluloid. Some film versions of plays manage to transcend the source to make an exciting film. A classic example is TWELVE ANGRY MEN, which takes twelve jurors and locks them in a single room for nearly two hours. But it makes a great film because the camera is so magnificently active, moving agilely from close up to group shot to isolating a couple of figures. The camera in BUTTERFLIES ARE FREE is, however, static and passive. It merely stands in front of each scene and lazily absorbs the action. It doesn't get close and explore what it happening. In other words, the camera isn't an important part of the telling of the story. As a result, it never becomes more than what it was onstage. I also am not fond of Edward Albert Jr., but that is a strictly personal reaction, and not an objective criticism of the film. My final problem with the film is that sometimes, because it is merely a filmed play, it sometimes gets a tad dull in the dialogue. Some of the talk is [not good]. For instance, the scene that takes place the morning after Jill and Don sleep together, before Don's mother shows up, is quite dull. I almost wondered if the reason Goldie Hawn spent the entire scene in her underwear wasn't to make up for the dullness of what the two of them were saying.
So, not a masterpiece, but definitely worth seeing for catching the young Goldie Hawn and for the magnificent Eileen Heckart.",1055376000,11,3250,4.436454849498328
