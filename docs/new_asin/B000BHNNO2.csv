2417317,3,B000BHNNO2,"Although Eric did present some convincing information in parts of his video there were several misconceptions he is pushing which does not hold up. He constantly refers to the jet fuel as a hydrocarbon of which it is but all hydrocarbons have different flame temperatures when burning. He seems to ignore this fact claiming the temperature is no higher than a candle, his gas range and his fireplace flame. I have personally measured jet fuel fires as high as 3,000 degrees F. Even as low as 1300 degrees F steel loses half it tensile strength and will begin to sag  and the sagging would be a lot with the loads which were present in 911. Steel melts at about 2200-2500 degrees F so why all the mystery? He drums the impossibility of a fire causing collapse over and over comparing the fire to a candle, his kitchen stove and his fireplace. Methane gas used in a kitchen stove or a candle flame can get no  hotter than about 1600-1800  degrees F. The comparison is ridiculous. also he claims aluminum airplane parts should have been found at the pentagon. Aluminum melts at about 1200  degrees F.  I have personally seen aluminum melt in a jet fuel fire and flow into a puddle on the floor of my testing area. At the temperatures seen at the pentagon the aluminum would have melted and flowed as a liquid to the bottom of the rubble, unseen by observers and misinterpreted by people with no scientific understanding of what happens in jet fuel fires. Black smoke is caused by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. This would occur after an initial explosion not at the same time as Eric suggested. There was also  plenty of fuel to  burn other than jet fuel--bodies, seats,  desks, construction material, etc. Its too bad he made some good points and then destroyed his argument by comparing the fire to a normal office fires, cars, and kitchen appliances. He also failed to mention that there was a back up generator in the basement and a fuel tank which could have also exploded from jet fuel pouring down the elevator shaft and burning there. I did however like his explanation of the collapse of building 7--that theory has merit. One more point-if there were explosives the terrorist could have planted them as well. All in all it was entertaining and he brought up some points I thought had valid possibilities. He also presented accurate information on how rocket fuel works--he must have consulted experts on that one--too bad he didn't consult experts on jet fuel.",1186358400,3,2475,4.712962962962963
2417318,5,B000BHNNO2,"A more thoughtful, critical, and honest consideration of 9/11 events than the pretense provided to the public by the state propaganda machine.  At this point it would be difficult to ""prove"" anything one way or the other, but it is clear that the ""official story"" is a cover-up and a deception that does not represent the truth or the facts.",1167782400,3,341,4.683333333333334
2417319,5,B000BHNNO2,"'Painful Deceptions' was one of the first DVD's I ever watched about the strange collapse of 3 World Trade buildings and the mysterious anomalies surrounding Flight 77 into the Pentagon. I am thrilled to see it here on Amazon.

This very important DVD provided a cornerstone for many other people who dedicated their time and money to investigate and present to you questions and perspectives the mainstream media is not asking.

Without the ongoing work of independent people like Eric Hufschmid and others like him, Americans will never learn the truth.",1166313600,10,555,5.087912087912088

IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS ""9/11 IN PLANE SITE"" BUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT OF 09/11/2001, THEN THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO AS FAR AS THE INFORMATION PRESENTED.",1156204800,5,327,4.015384615384615
2417321,5,B000BHNNO2,"If you have never seen a documentary about 9/11 here is a great place to start! It's full of very important testimony of what really happened on that day. It goes into technical details to about the fires, planes and also buildings. This movie will open your eyes. Why don't more people see it? I think it's because they don't want to believe the full truth. One day all of it will be out. Please look online to find out information/facts about that day that you won't find on the news. Also look into building 7 of the world trade centre. Its not only lies we are being told but many issues of the day have been left out of reports and investigations. Why won't anyone talk about Building 7?? Here is a building not hit by a plane and yet it falls neatly to the ground? It had a few small fires, which sprinklers could have put out. Don't take my word for it, see for yourself. How can people dismiss the testimony of police and fireman who heard bombs? Bombs were not even looked into in any of the official reports. Are all these fine men and women making it all up? Please watch this movie and also ones like it and get the word out",1147651200,17,1136,4.215596330275229
2417322,5,B000BHNNO2,"...with their special, trademarked explosives, then I'd like to start a new business called ""Fire Demolition, Incorporated!""  This company will demolish buildings by setting a few small fires on a few floors.  These fires will demolish the building just as thorougly, but at a much lower cost!  I need money to get this business established!  Are any of YOU interested in investing???""

-This wry humor is from Eric Hufschmid, the creator of Painful Questions (book) and Painful Deceptions (video).  I still have yet to actually read the book as I still don't own a copy; however, I've probably watched the Painful Deceptions DVD a hundred times now, many of those occasions with people I know, as they watch slack-jawed in one of those life-changing epiphianic moments.  Jimmy Walter of reopen911.org had his moment of 9/11 epiphany with this DVD.

It is very difficult to look at a painful historical event with a cool, rational, scientific mind.  Many people can't bear to watch the towers collapse, just as many people can't bear to watch gruesome Holocaust footage.  However, when the events of Setember 11, 2001 are viewed in a detached, scientific manner, we realize how OBVIOUS it is that the WTC towers AND BUILDING SEVEN were controlled demolitions.  The government's theory on why the buildings collapsed is a bunch of hogwash, to paraphrase Cap. Robert Bowman.  The buildings collapsed at free-fall speed, which translates into about TEN FLOORS PER SECOND.  This is only possible if explosives were shattering the floors slightly faster than the rubble was falling, i.e. slightly faster then the speed of gravity.  The detonations always kept ahead of the rubble.

Some official theory defenders say that the felling of the towers wasn't needed; mere airplane crashes would have roused the nationalistic patriotic orgy which ensued.  I disagree.  Without the implosion of the towers, we would not have had thousands of citizens on the ground fleeing in terror.  Plus, the towers were symbols of American might, whose complete destruction would certainly instill more anger in the average Joe than the mere fires.

Unlike 911 In Plane Site by Dave vonKleist, the arguments presented here lie not with suppressed news footage and recoreded eyewitness testimony (some of which can be interpreted multiple ways), but with scientific fact.  Specifically, pieces of a building cannot crash through steel and concrete as fast as they fall through the air.  This, in and of itself, is proof that 9/11 was a government black-op, a false-flag operation engineered to mobilize public opinion.

Also on this video are an in-depth analysis of the Pentagon attack, including executive officals who removed airplane scraps from the scene right after the event, and a mysterious item hidden behind a tarp.  Hufschmid suggests this was to hide evidence that a remote-controlled drone hit the Pentagon, not Flight 77.  Though it might sound outlandish, the photos of the rubble do support this theory, as does the fact that many security videos, including those of a gas station and Sheraton hotel, are under lock-and-key by the FBI.

At the end of the presentation is a probe into human nature, and how it's possible for a government to get away with such a huge conspiracy.",1135296000,32,3269,5.099624060150376
2417323,5,B000BHNNO2,"Best DVD  available exposing the 9/11 scam- nothing from the official story fits the real

evidence shown in this DVD.  Also explains that the American people are gullible and

brainwashed to believing authority figures. ""We the sheepel ""

The media blackout hidden evidence and worse- deliberate disinformation.

Only controlled demolitions could bring down those towers- building 7 was admittedly ""pulled""-

Flight 77 never hit the pentagon - no boeing 757 parts found-

Erics does an excellent job of  illustrating the evidence available in 2003 proving that  the attack

on 9/11 was a obvious scam, a fake terrorist attack.. A cruel hoax committed by rouge elements

of our own government and others seeking to profit from war and oil.

Eric peels all the fluff away and lets you see that in the real world, fact about gravity, heat, laws of physis etc, will not let you explain 911 with the ""oficial story"".

Eric has gotten in  disfavor with the powers that be by exposing the masterminds behind 911 as the Jewish elite, Jewish mafia, Zionist, or Askanazi Jews. He has taken a lot of heat trying to inform the rest of us and reviving our critical thinking.

He is not perfect, but who is, although he does not agree with my belief system, I thank God for Eric's strength and fortitude to stay the course.",1289433600,2,718,4.343283582089552

8086878,5,B000BHNNO2,"This is an excellent well done video. Brought up many points, logic and common sense I've not heard even in other great videos. My only gripe is that sometimes I felt like it was made for a kindergarten audience, just in the way that Eric sometimes talks, but that's just how he is though.

He's a smart guy and present a totally compelling case with irrefutable proof. In those areas where there is no ""proof"", he raises many serious questions with compelling ideas and solid circumstantial evidence, certainly faar more in favor of a cover up and an inside job than any evidence the government presents to supposedly support their case that the building collapsed due to fire!.

8086880,5,B000BHNNO2,"As other reviewers have already said, this is the best DVD put out so far about the 911 tragedy.  It presents more raw data than any other, and ties up more loose ends.  It isn't perfect; but it does present a convincing case.  In a way, debunking the official story is like taking candy from a baby: there are so many not only unanswered but unasked questions to the official story that it's not hyperbole to call that story a myth.  But is there any possibility that everything happened just like the official story says?  In a parallel universe, where everything goes exactly according to plan, yes, of course it could have.  The point is, the conspiracy version allows for human error and unexpected occurrences - but the official version does not.  For the official version to be true, not so much as the random flutter of a butterfly's wing could have taken place.  There's a halfway decent website - debunkig911.com - which tries to shoot down, point by point, the issues raised by the 911 truth movement.  But at the end of the day, its arguments in favor of the official version are far weaker than the arguments Eric Hufschmid presents.  And, of course, the History Channel's presentation of the Popular Mechanics attempt at debunking the 911 truth movement is hopelessly flawed - before even a single issue is examined.  They present it as: 1. Claim and 2. Fact.  Any honest, scientific examination of the issues would go: 1. Claim; 2. Counterclaim; and then 3. Conclusion/Fact.  But, of course, we know that those who support the official version depend ultimately on branding those questioning that version as crackpots.  If truth is on their side, why do they need to resort to name calling?",1206403200,6,1705,4.755102040816326
8086881,4,B000BHNNO2,"As others, I have looked deeply into the various facets of this complex issue,(as a layman, I admit),and I feel this is a good expose of the underlying 9/11 reality. True enough, it is rather slow and laborious at times, but those that consider actual facts and NOT governmental and media posturing alone will be enlightened. Some, like the 'Professor', (without listing credentials), believing that jet fuel fires can reach and sustain amazing degrees of heat and extreme damage, though curiously haven't considered the mounting 'gray' evidence of thermaline in the liquid steel at the buildings long burning nether regions. Then there is the obvious, even symetrical look of known demolitions,( ""decided to go ahead and pull it!""-Silverberg), the reports of bombs and explosions all through that fatal morning and the freefall of building 7 that actually recieved so little damage that, at first FEMA were at a loss to even attempt an explanation as to it's unusual collapse. Also, that no other steel structured buildings have been known to fall in this way before or since and yet, THREE do so on one day requires more than the distortions and omissions of the official 911 Report. We all do need to wise up and many of us are doing just that.
  I pesonally counted 29 definite mysteries over the years that either did not add up or needed more investigation to properly explain. One example would be the Pentagon did appear to have a basically round hole with no place for the wings to enter that would surely have been sheared off and the few videos that were so far released have not done much to explain these, or other discrepancies. Not to mentin the Trade Center security shut-downs previously to the attack that conveniently put out the monitoring camera systems for days at a time certainly seem worthy of suspicion.
  Surely,the melting point of jet fuel,(I've heard more about 800 to 1300 degree ranges), at differing stages is not the only issue to these collapses, the vagaries of the hijackers, the actions of key governmental persons and positions,ignorance of previous intelligence as evidence of trouble in the making,original opinions and assesments by experts compared to firings of any that gave a different voice to the proceedings, and the many peculiarities of this tragic event tend to lead one to question much of officialdom and keep open to real answers however tough it may be to accept.",1189209600,2,2419,4.921568627450981
