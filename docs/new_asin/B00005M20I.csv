1624353,5,B00005M20I,"VIRTUALLY FLAWLESS! RANDY MADE THIS DVD RIGHT. HE HAD A CONCERT JUST FOR THE CREATION OF THIS DVD, AND AS HE STATES ON THE DVD; THE CROWD REALLY GOT INTO IT. THE VIDEO IS CRYSTAL CLEAR, THE LIGHTING PERFECT. THE AUDIO IS AWESOME, DOLBY DIGITAL AND DTS, PUTS YOU RIGHT IN THE CONCERT, MY WIFE AND I THOUGHT WE WERE BACK AT ONE OF THE PREVIOUS SHOWS WE HAD SEEN, HOWEVER WITH BETTER SOUND. REFERENCE QUALITY DVD, A MUST OWN FOR ANY RANDY TRAVIS FAN.",998611200,16,447,4.270588235294118
1624364,5,B00005M20I,"I was unable to watch this product due to it being recorded in USA Region1 and it will not open in Australia. We ned to have products in Region 4. Some dvd's allow you to change the region but this one would not. Since I have returned  the dvd a friend has been able to obtaina copy of this dvd and it is a single dvd disc and made in Region 4, so we were able to watch a great dvd.",1346198400,,382,3.7160493827160495
1624365,1,B00005M20I,"This DVD had great potential.  I have been to his live concerts, but this DVD falls flat.  I had to sell it to a reseller, I could not bear to watch it again.  There is no energy to his stage presence.  How did it ever get produced?",1268870400,,232,3.872340425531915
1624366,5,B00005M20I,"This is a great DVD of Randy Travis in concert. Not a bad song in the bunch! It contains many of his best-known songs, then gows into ssome of his first christian music. Either way, we win! He just doesn't do anything but really good music. The additional features are fun. too.",1229904000,3,278,4.365384615384615

1624368,5,B00005M20I,"This DVD has lived up to all my expectations. Just listening to Randy sing, soothes the soul and spirit. I live in the Caribbean and have not been privileged to see him perform live, but I felt as though I was part of the audience as he sang. This is a must for any true connoisseur of Country & Western music.",1199923200,5,310,4.098360655737705
1624369,5,B00005M20I,Excellent DVD.. Just like being there.. If you like Mr. Travis.. this a really good concert,1170979200,2,91,4.75
1624370,5,B00005M20I,"This was another of Randy's excellent peformances! My husband and I recently saw Randy Travis (again) in live concert, and this CD just re-captured his wonderfully talented voice, his boyish charm and appeal, and it brought back such fond memories of his live performance for us. There just is no other voice quite like Randy's and as soon as he begins to make a sound you know who it is! ""It's just a matter of time""...! We also enjoyed the back-stage relevations by Randy; he's just a good ol' country boy at heart and he's down right human!",1125100800,5,543,4.551020408163265
1624371,4,B00005M20I,"You can't imagine how wonderfull is for someone living in southern Europe where country music concerts are almost non existent, to watch a DVD with the quality sound and image of this one. I hope many other country music artists can do the same: To record a high quality DVD that brings to your home a concert or concerts you don't have the oportunity to see, specially if you don't live in England, Ireland or Holland. Thanks, Randy!",1045440000,8,434,4.576923076923077
1624372,5,B00005M20I,"I attended the Ft Worth concert he did here in April, 2002 and this DVD is just like the real thing!!  Its totally awesome, don't miss it!!",1020556800,6,139,4.148148148148148
1624373,5,B00005M20I,"The long awaited live concert of Randy Travis is finally here. And it was well worth the wait. It is fan-tastic. The acoustics are masterful, lighting is magnificent and the choreography flows so smoothly it is hard to believe that you are not right there in the audience. Veteran live album director Steve Binder has done a stand-up job with this performance. Nothing short of genius. The camera shots, zooms and pans are so creative at times you are right there in front of Randy. Randy's intro is astounding complete with fog and back lighting. I have not experienced this kind of excitement in a live album since Mr. Binder's documentary of Elvis Presley. For me, this album rates as high as Elvis'. Randy is at his most creative, energetic and exuberant. His performance is warm, funny and engaging. He is at home with his audience and performing at his best. Once more his audience is lively, responsive and engaged in his every move. Not subdued like in a lot of live concert performances. The musician's harmonies and performance is outstanding. You can tell that they really enjoy performing with Randy. They are at home with innovative musical style. To conclude this experience, don't miss the bonus material of former President Bush's insight into the real Randy Travis. Randy's own interview gives you insight into the creativity and depth of this man's thoughts. You can grasp a real feeling of genuineness and the love that he has for his music and his acting; especially westerns and being a cowboy at heart. His fondness for his fans and his sincere Christian faith will touch each person's heart. For Randy, it is not being a star or a performer, for none of that has affected him. It is the flood of love outpouring from his fans and the enjoyment of being able to be with them and entertain them that keeps this cowboy going. Randy may admit to being every parent's nightmare when he was a teenager but he truly has everyone's love and admiration now. He is every parent's dream child and a mentor for every parent to point their child towards. It is a must have for every RT fan. If you are not an RT fan, don't worry, you will be after you see this performance.",998697600,14,2183,4.6434108527131785

7945108,3,B00005M20I,"Randy Travis was a big deal in the beginning of his career for being more  traditional.  I thought he was okay.  With an occasional great song like Forever And Ever Amen.  Which is included here.  But to be honest I am more of a fan of the  pop/country artists like Shania.  This is a good live concert dvd with songs like On The Other Hand,Deeper Than The Holler and Diggin' Up Bones.",1507334400,,385,4.263888888888889

7945113,5,B00005M20I,"I bought this DVD, i liked the first disc, I thought it was excellent. But the secound DVD is kind of stupid and not of much use. It just has the music of the concert and his picture on the screen and of him talking. Just like the concert but no randy. I might toss that. but as for the concert it is great. If you are a randy travis fan like me u will love it. Almost like attending a real concert. Randy is his real self. Great on a large screen ,good sound, I am glad i bought it. I wish there was more like it. There is a good interview of him also. I would recomend it to every Randy travis fan.
