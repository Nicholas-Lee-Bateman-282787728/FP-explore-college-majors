8145563,3,B000II4OC4,"They show this on Lifetime Movie Network all the time and I've never wanted to watch it until now. I enjoyed it so much that I taped it on DVD.

This movie stars Tracy Gold as a young woman (who we don't know much about) who is thrust into an escape that she needs but didn't plan on.

The film opens with Liddy (Gold, with the cutest little haircut I might add), sitting in her truck, reflecting on the events of the night before. She's been working at a bar for sleazy owner Jackie and his brother. Jackie's brother has a thing for Liddy and can't take no for an answer. He constantly paws and hounds her when she's working and even grabs her to make her dance with him. She breaks a bottle just to get him off of her and from that point we truly see the kind of life Liddy's been living.

Liddy tells Jackie she's leaving and wants the money he owes her. He refuses to give it to her and instead tells her to take off her clothes and dance for him and his brother. His little brother chases Liddy around the bar, carries her to a backroom and rapes her. Liddy stabs him in self-defense and slashes Jackie on the neck when he tries to stop her from leaving.

The next day Liddy catches a ride with a young couple. They are going to visit the man's family who has never met his new wife. They get into an accident, the couple dies and Liddy ends up in the hospital. The guy's parents, (Dee Wallace Stone and Kevin Dobson) mistake Liddy for their son's wife. She tries to explain but they don't listen. This part was very unrealistic and a bit silly but for the film's sake obviously. Maureen (Stone) takes a quick liking to Liddy. We get the feeling she's always wanted a daughter, and persuades Liddy to stay with her and Kevin Dobson in their huge house.

On the day of the funeral for the son, Liddy meets the son's friend Jed or Jett(Cameron Bancroft). They hit it off immediately and soon start a romance. Liddy ends up working at the family's winery and it's not long that Jackie shows up. He sees her face in the paper and he comes for what he feels he is owed. Turns out that his brother died (Liddy had no idea) and he wants compensation. From there we go to the average Lifetime Movie where the victim ends up blackmailed. Soon after Liddy ends up pregnant from the rape and Jackie has even more ammunition to use against her.

Liddy gives in to Jackie but he doesn't go away. He comes up with a plot to steal wine from the family winery. Jackie makes Liddy steal wine with him. They are confronted by Bancroft. Jackie stabs Bancroft tries to force Liddy into leaving with him and ends up shot by Maureen.

That's the plot in a nutshell. This film was entertaining but it wasn't much new here. What I enjoyed were the characters and how they related to each other. The film was extremely unrealistic and laughable in spots. First, Maureen refuses to let Liddy explain who she really is at the hospital and takes her in without question. You'd think they'd have done some kind of background check on this woman at some point but then again they wouldn't have had a movie if they had.

The rape was unconvincing. It didn't appear that she was actually raped at first because she and her attacker were wearing pants and both looked fully clothed at the end of the supposed attack. At first I thought she'd been a victim of attempted rape until she ended up pregnant. The way the rape storyline was handled was insulting to victims of the crime. Liddy showed no sadness or any type of emotional problems after she was raped. She is raped and she just goes on like it's no big deal. She didn't even cry. I also don't see why she didn't call the police but chose to run off. That didn't make any sense. She had no reason to run because she didn't know until later that her attacker had been murdered. Also when she found out she was pregnant, it was no big deal. I could barely stomach how she seemed to not be affected by the rape but when she didn't seem bothered by carrying the rapist's baby, that was just too far-fetched.

One of the most unbelievable things was the end. Stone and Dobson just forgive Liddy instantly despite her deception. They weren't mad for even a minute and that was truly pathetic.

This movie is full of mistakes but I forgave them because the parts I enjoyed outweighed them but it really irks me as a woman especially when rape is used as a plot device and not handled respectively. I'd think if Liddy had shown one ounce of emotion toward being raped, I wouldn't have had an issue with it but it was obvious it was just something thrown in for the movie.

This comes on LMN all the time so if you have that channel, I wouldn't waste money purchasing it. Save your money and check it out when it comes back on television. You might enjoy it if the unbelievable parts aren't too hard to stomach.",1309046400,5,4831,4.321192052980132
