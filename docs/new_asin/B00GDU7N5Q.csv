8622410,5,B00GDU7N5Q,"Great DVD if you are into Q-dance/Defqon 1 stuff. The Blu-ray is almost like being there especially if you have a good sound system. You will get 3 discs. A Blu-ray DVD in NTSC format, a regular DVD in PAL format, & an audio CD. Keep in mind the Blu-ray disc is in NTSC format & it WILL play on Blu-ray DVD players made for the U.S. The regular DVD is in PAL format & it will NOT play in DVD players made for the U.S.  I use a Playstation 3 for Blu-ray & it works fine.",1395532800,,469,3.8350515463917527
