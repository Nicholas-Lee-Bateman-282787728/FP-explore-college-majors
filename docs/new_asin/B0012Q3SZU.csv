3093058,4,B0012Q3SZU,"I personally love the series, but because it's somewhat a matter of opinion, I'm not going to try to persuade you to buy this based solely on the plot material.  The story revolves around Eva, a young girl who sets out to meet her father, Don Wei (who dumped her off at a boarding school when she was young), who is a famous professional star racing manager.  Meanwhile, Don is tasked with leading a small crew to victory in the race of Oban on a planet far away.  Earlier, a hostile race of aliens known as the Krogs attacked Earth.  It was only because The Avatar, host of the Race of Oban, and a godlike being, called for a temporary ceasefire, so that all racers of the galaxy could prepare for the race in peace, that the Krogs made a quick retreat, handing mankind a narrow victory.  Now that the race is fast approaching, the treaty will no longer be in effect, allowing the Krogs to once again attack.  Only by winning the race can Earth save itself.

So Don gathers a small group of people, including top grade racer Rick, and the two mechanics Stan and Koji, before making the journey to Alwas, where the race preliminaries begin.  Eva meets him before he goes, but he doesn't recognize her.  Frustrated, she changes her name to Molly and stows away with the rest of the crew.

The only series I can think of that compares to this one is IGPX.  If you liked IGPX, I suspect you will like the action in this as well, though I think IGPX is a more mature series.

The DVD itself was a little disappointing.  You get two discs containing the first half the series.  The thing that disappointed me was that you could only see one of the openings.  This series has two openings; the ""Never Say Never"" one people who saw this on Jetix will be familiar with, and the Japanese opening.  I like them both, but it would have been nice to be able to switch between the two.

There's no subtitles, and it only plays in English, though I'm not sure if  the show was ever aired in Japanese (or French, noting that this is a French-Japanese collaboration), so I can't call it a complaint.

If you like high speed racing, and a decent plot, I don't think you can go wrong with this, for the rather low price tag.",1248048000,,2206,4.336585365853659
3093059,5,B0012Q3SZU,"Well this was a bit of a surprise, and a pleasant surprise at that. I was looking for a more fun anime series, as it has been awhile since I've taken on a series like that.

There's no mistaking that this is a series that is a bit more family friendly than others, but it manages this without giving it that saturday morning cartoon feel. The story itself still has quite a bit of depth to it, and it runs the full range of emotions, both negative and positive. It explores major issues like danger, and death, in a way that works for a show like this without having a negative effect on its impact.

The characters face death and injury, encounter personal conflicts amongst each other, feel the highs of victory and sting of defeat and so on; the story doesn't suffer from the lack of certain ""mature"" components. It's a family friendly cartoon, but manages to do so without feeling overly kiddy. Sex, blood and violence are obviously missing, which is fine since this series really wouldn't benefit from any of those. Aside from that though, it still manages to develop the characters well and provide a story with enough depth, something many series aimed at family audiences just can't pull off.

The art style might take a bit of getting used to. It's a collaboration between a Japanese studio and a French studio, so while the anime element is obviously there, it does have a different feel to it. The most notable unique element of the art style is the lack of defined noses on the characters, but it works once you get adjusted to it. The color palette used and how well the colors blend makes the series really quite impressive visually. The CG also mixes in well with the 2D, it doesn't really suffer from that out of place feeling that you get in other shows where the two styles are mixed.

As long as you're no the type who needs that certain ""maturity"" that anime titles loaded with fanservice, gore, or really dark storylines provide, then this is definitely worth a look. You certainly can't go wrong with an entire 26 episode series being released on two volumes under $20 a piece either.

For those that are hardcore sub fans though, you might be disappointed in that the series is presented with the English dub only. It's a well done dub though, and the series was made with the intention of being broadcast internationally as well. One thing worth noting as well is that the DVD uses the opening and closing songs used in the Japanese/French version, and not the songs used in the US broadcast version.

All in all it's a good series that is fun and lighthearted, but still provides enough depth and conflict to tell a good, engaging story. It's also a good deal as well as each volume has 13 episodes a piece and normally be found for around $15 (MSRP is set at 19.99). If you enjoy a series like this, then this is a good buy.",1212278400,10,2850,4.492277992277992
3093060,4,B0012Q3SZU,"This series is really exceptional - creative concept from Europe blended with an original and mostly unseen before now anime style. There's very little culture shock associated with the film - no overt Japanese or American sensibilities catered to - it's basically a show anyone anywhere can watch. It's a fun series, not offensive but not childish either. Recommended!",1210723200,5,369,5.271186440677966
3093061,5,B0012Q3SZU,"I watched the first volume not knowing what to expect, and ended up really liking it. The animation and character design has a really cute, solid style, and the backgrounds are absolutely beautiful (especially during race scenes with shots soaring over the landscape). I really enjoyed seeing all the different alien races and their ships, as well; they were creatively designed. The main character Eva (AKA Molly) was a refreshing alternative to most young female characters one finds these days - smart, strong, but with all the imperfections of her youth.

One thing I liked a lot was the fact that Rick Thunderbolt, who seemed at first like a token jock and a plot device thrown in to simply create an obstacle (he was even taken out by a convenient accident), comes back to become a mentor figure for Molly.

Even as an (nearly) 18 year old, I liked this show a lot and am eager to see the second volume.",1208822400,5,909,4.6397515527950315

3093148,5,B0012Q3SZU,"This story line takes a turn back to the Speed Racer days of win the race to save the world. I never tire of the ""struggle"" that happens when ""Right"" means fight and the balance of humanity hinges on the obvious underdog. The characters in this story are likeable, hateable, and honorable. I thought this series fun and I get great joy watching my granddaughters become so involved with the personalities of different characters. Moral values, intestinal fortitude, and ideals like David and Goliath where the outcome is not portioned out by strength of muscle but by a will not to quit when the outcome seems impossible. In a word values. Lots of fun. Peace.

3093181,5,B0012Q3SZU,"Hi. I purchased this set of DVD's because I liked the series when it was broadcast on the Disney channel.
It is a story of a broken family. The mother that was a racer, died in a racing accident. The father despondent puts his daughter in a boarding school and disappears, but later forms a racing team and forgets about his past.
The daughter leaves the school with the help of a scooter and searches out to re-bond with her father, but her father does not recognize her, so she changes her name to be close to him.
Worlds are selected across the galaxy to race once every 10,000 years to determine the next Galactic Avatar to rule over all races of people. There is danger, flying cars, interstellar travel, a re-bonding of father and daughter and in the end peace.
The computer animated CGI is quite note worthy when the racer is racing around the obstacles on the various planets!
Rated ""G"" for all audiences.
I highly recommend this Anime for old and young kids alike.",1358553600,3,973,4.502824858757062

When it first started, I was a little uncertain.  The style isn't one of my favorites.  But once I got used to it, the plot, the characters, and the imagination took over, and I was all but in my own ship with them in the race.  What fun!",1355011200,,339,3.926470588235294

3327645,5,B0012Q3SZU,"This story line takes a turn back to the Speed Racer days of win the race to save the world. I never tire of the ""struggle"" that happens when ""Right"" means fight and the balance of humanity hinges on the obvious underdog. The characters in this story are likeable, hateable, and honorable. I thought this series fun and I get great joy watching my granddaughters become so involved with the personalities of different characters. Moral values, intestinal fortitude, and ideals like David and Goliath where the outcome is not portioned out by strength of muscle but by a will not to quit when the outcome seems impossible. In a word values. Lots of fun. Peace.

3327678,5,B0012Q3SZU,"Hi. I purchased this set of DVD's because I liked the series when it was broadcast on the Disney channel.
It is a story of a broken family. The mother that was a racer, died in a racing accident. The father despondent puts his daughter in a boarding school and disappears, but later forms a racing team and forgets about his past.
The daughter leaves the school with the help of a scooter and searches out to re-bond with her father, but her father does not recognize her, so she changes her name to be close to him.
Worlds are selected across the galaxy to race once every 10,000 years to determine the next Galactic Avatar to rule over all races of people. There is danger, flying cars, interstellar travel, a re-bonding of father and daughter and in the end peace.
The computer animated CGI is quite note worthy when the racer is racing around the obstacles on the various planets!
Rated ""G"" for all audiences.
I highly recommend this Anime for old and young kids alike.",1358553600,3,973,4.502824858757062

When it first started, I was a little uncertain.  The style isn't one of my favorites.  But once I got used to it, the plot, the characters, and the imagination took over, and I was all but in my own ship with them in the race.  What fun!",1355011200,,339,3.926470588235294

8247162,2,B0012Q3SZU,"Obviously I loved the series enough to write this ridiculously long review. So the series would get max stars. But the actual product, not so much

I felt it necessary to right this review to warn those who are looking at the quality when buying physical releases. After what's become of the hard copy release of Code Lyoko(a series the co-director helped create), I decided to jump on these. The creator of the series is currently planning a Blu-ray release that has been remastered with a proper HD aspect ratio. But it doesn't hurt to play it safe with the DVDs.

First, an example of the effort that went into this release of the series. From researching I discovered that the individual in charge didn't get the opening song of the US airing because ""it was more difficult than getting the Japanese song's license"". Not actually a negative, but a solid example of the lengths they went to.

Now on to the actual quality. At first, I thought my eyes were playing with my mind. But the animation is randomly choppy and stutters. The ""camera"" will pan to the right and you'll see a flash of a character that was just moved out of frame. Many scenes look like they were corrupted mildly when the data was transferred. Don't expect the same quality you remember on Jetix.

On to the audio. The farther I got into the DVD, the more I noticed. I had to turn the volume up significantly to match the noise of a regular film or TV show. The real issue showed itself in Cruel Like Ceres. You can't hear what the titular character is saying over his ""warped"" voice's effect.  Let alone the sounds of the special effects he creates.

All and all, this is just above a bare bones release. If you have the $14-15 to spare and the Blu-ray isn't out yet or you really don't care that much, go for it. Personally, I'm still going to get the ban Cycle DVDs because I'm paranoid about the Blu-ray falling through. And having something is better than nothing.",1521244800,,1944,4.492917847025495

8247168,5,B0012Q3SZU,"Oban Star-Racers accomplishes in 26 episodes what most animes can barely do in 50; to get the audience to truly care for the characters and story. Most extraordinary of all is that it achieves this without the use of blood, sex, and overtly epic, dramatic, comedic or cheesy scenes. From the very beginning, the heroine knows what she's fighting for. True that it isn't until later on that she discovers how deep things go, but most anime heroes don't even get the first clue of what their mission is until the 15th episode. Furthermore, the intelligence and depth of OSR equals that of a successful young adult novel series. In fact, it's practically the anime version of The Hunger Games. The plots are strangely similar considering that OSR came out two years before THG; a rebellious 15-16 year-old girl competes in a televised event that will determine the fate of humanity. Despite this, the girl is competing solely for personal reasons; to save her family. Moreover, both stories deal with themes of ""the inevitable"" and what it takes to move ahead after having experienced great trauma. The only difference is that they each handle these themes differently, and OSR is set in outer space.",1482105600,,1197,4.872549019607843
