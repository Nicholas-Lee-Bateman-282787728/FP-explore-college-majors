2556228,5,B000F9T73C,"I don't understand why but my daughter just loves it. We own all the 5 DVDs so far on the market and almost every books also.

At very beginning, I bought a ready-to-read book (level-1) of this serious accidentally: ""Piggly makes the pie"". Although she was just several months over one years old and hardly could understand most of words ( we talked to her in Chinese most of the time ), it soon became her favorite book. The book is very good. It has little picture icons to help the little kids in reading, e.g.: apple, window , goat, etc. all shown by both words and pictures in the line.

PBS also has a ""Jakers"" stories website for little kids. There are 4 stories, reading by grandpa ""Piggley"". Now it has been our bed-time stories club every night. If you like, you can go and try it first.

Now we read the book, watch the DVDs and go the PBS.com to meet our grandpa Piggley every day!",1219190400,2,893,4.303571428571429
2556229,5,B000F9T73C,Loved it - Both myself and my 4 year old just love Jakers - Actually seen it on TV in Ireland when home visiting family and she loved watching it with her cousins so was really delighted to find it available online here. Cute show with great graphics and a cute lesson in each episode. I highly recommend this show for pre-schoolers.,1218585600,,333,4.387096774193548
2556230,5,B000F9T73C,"Jakers is a great show for young children, each episode is full of adventure and fun as well as a good moral lesson. I enjoy watching Jakers as much as my son does! The CGI animation is fantastic on DVD.",1195516800,,203,4.1
2556231,5,B000F9T73C,"we don't have kids but my husband actually stumbled upon this show one sunday morning when we were without cable and we thought it was adorable! i recently bought it for my best friend's 2 year old daughter and was so happy to get an e-mail saying that she LOVES jakers and is always asking ""watch jakers?"" i know how kids get about a favorite show/dvd, so i figured if my husband and i liked it then it would definitely be a hit with parents and kids.",1192665600,2,452,4.206896551724138
2556232,5,B000F9T73C,My son loves this DVD! Its 4 Jakers! episodes rather than a full length movie which is great since kids get restless when watching long shows. Great lessons learned in each episode also. Highly recommend it.,1192665600,,207,4.777777777777778
2556233,4,B000F9T73C,"Not only my son loves to watch the 4 movies comes with this DVD, My wife and I enjoyed watching too. Jackes has always been the kind of animated series not only enjoyable to kids but also to adults.

The reason I gave it 4 stars is that every story seems just a little too short for me.",1182816000,,286,3.9310344827586206
2556234,5,B000F9T73C,"Hey, I love this show and I just wanted to give you the episode listing for this DVD:

Salmon of Knowledge

Rock Around the Cluck

New Best Friends

Little Bit of Something Extra! Extra!",1168732800,21,186,4.382352941176471
2556235,5,B000F9T73C,"We are big fans of Jakers.  The kids really enjoy watching this.  Jakers is all about storytelling.  The Grandpa is telling tales of his youth to his grandsons.  Since this is set in Ireland, the animals have a bit of a brogue and use Irish sayings.  After the cartoon, real Grandparents tell stories of their youth.  This encourages families to share the past.",1163203200,6,361,4.650793650793651
8119462,5,B000F9T73C,Love this show! Arrived earlier then expected and got a very nice note to go along with it.,1495929600,,91,4.111111111111111

8119465,5,B000F9T73C,Mel Brooks and company are great story tellers. Even the adults enjoy watching the antics of these critters and the lessons are told not preached to them.,1378080000,,154,4.7407407407407405
8119466,5,B000F9T73C,"Our whole family absolutely loves this show (ages 2 and up!)...cute, funny, and teaching valuable lessons. I am only sorry I did not know about it until now and missed out on the opportunity to get the whole collection with every episode. From what I can gather, they made 13 videos worth with 4 episodes on every DVD. We have collected four with another one I can see available, but the rest don't seem to ever be available in North American format or at reasonable prices :( I even went so far as to try to contact the production company (twice now) to try to find out more information or see if I can get copies of the rest, but they have not responded. Really wish PBS would bring this show back. If you happen to know where I can get any more videos in North American DVD format, please comment/contact me!",1367107200,,811,4.342105263157895
8119467,5,B000F9T73C,This is a wonderful show for all ages. I wish it was easier and more affordable to find dvds as it is not on our cable any longer.,1363478400,,130,3.6785714285714284
8119468,5,B000F9T73C,"We love Jakers around here and it was nice to get it at such a decent price! I had no problems with the service, it was timely and everything was as it should have been!",1361318400,,169,3.857142857142857
8119469,4,B000F9T73C,Piggly and his friends are adorable. The occasional trouble they get into and the ways they learn new things are hilarious.,1344038400,,123,4.904761904761905
8119470,4,B000F9T73C,"The stories on the DVD are excellent. But the used DVD that I purchased from goHastings had physical damage which caused some parts of the video to skip. But for $8.49 (w/ shipping) what could I expect. Most of the content is viewable, so it's not really worth it to me to return.",1341187200,,280,4.30188679245283
8119471,5,B000F9T73C,"all of these piggley winks shows are just so good, you can't miss these.  great for the whole family.",1232323200,,101,4.315789473684211
