8204462,4,B000S6LTV0,"Jose Alfredo Jimenez has written so many classic Mexican songs, it's hard to imagine his talent.  It was fun to explore his early days and experience his older recordings. He is indeed ""El Rey"", the King of traditional Mexican music.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys seeing and hearing a great master at work.",1277856000,,325,4.684210526315789
