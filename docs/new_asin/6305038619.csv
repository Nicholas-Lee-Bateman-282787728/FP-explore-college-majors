956455,5,6305038619,"I love this entry in the MST3K collection because the short films cover such a wide area of topics.  My favorite is the one about the boy that cheats on a test and then goes into a severe Kafka-esque depression.  All  his friends scorn him and he sits alone in an unlit room watching the  pendulum swing back and forth.  Another great entry is ""Why Study  Industrial Arts?""  The best part is the entry in which a high school  boy narrates.  As he lists all the reasons that he loves Ind. Arts (the  sharp whine of the saw, the dull tap-tap of tools on leather) Mike and the  bots make him sound like a maniac(the piercing scream of a freshman, I like  to put sawdust in my underwear).  You will not be able to believe that the  poor kids of the 50s and 60s were subjected to this.",921024000,,780,4.1824324324324325
956456,5,6305038619,"The MST shorts video with more volumes to follow gives the MST3K fan a chance to re-live some of those wonderfully hideous short films that most children from (another generation) had to endure in school. A must see is  ""The Home Economics Story"" ""Chicken of Tomorrow"" and  ""Cheating"".  Catch Crow, Joel Servo and Mike at their best with  these very funny short films.",914371200,2,368,4.7936507936507935
956614,3,6305038619,"MST3K Shorts Volume 3 is inferior to the previous two volumes, but the tape does include seven shorts from the classic series of experiments--two with Joel and five with Mike.  The Speech short is famous for one thing only--the line about the importance of ""plenty of lip and tongue action.""  Beyond that, it basically just makes fun of the way a lot of people talk.  Aquatic Wizards takes us to a school for water skiing--it's even more boring than it sounds.  The embarrassingly ludicrous Design For Dreaming may well explain why foreign automobiles became all the rage in America.  The video features a strange woman and a masked man in a tuxedo singing and dancing about the cars and kitchen of the future.  I don't think the mask was part of the script; the guy was probably so embarrassed about the job that he wanted to hide his identity.
How many nights have you lain awake wondering just how ice cream merchandising works?  Really! Um, well, wonder no more.  The Selling Wizard (in the guise of a mute caped woman wearing a tablecloth vest) will tell you everything you need to know about selling ice cream hand over fist.  Here's a secret everyone may not know--refrigeration and freezing units.  That's all I can say here.  Interestingly, this riveting video comes from Annheiser Busch.  This is probably the least funny short in MST3K history.  The guys basically just watch the video and randomly make comments about the difficulty of choosing the right model for themselves.
Out of This World is a truly weird one.  I don't know if there is a patron saint for bread salesmen, but there is a demon and an angel who oversee the careers of all purveyors of fine baked goods.  When one inefficient salesman learns the error of his ways, the demon bets the angel that he will slip back to his old ways.  We basically watch the bread truck guy go on his rounds, fostering grocer goodwill and talking grocers into selling more bread more prominently.  I have no idea why, but I find the video itself quite interesting, and there are some funny moments, but this isn't really a stellar short.  Then, we have Once Upon a Honeymoon.  I have no idea what it was supposed to be about.  A songwriter and his wife have waited a year for their honeymoon; when the boss calls and says a song must be rewritten, it is up to a goofy angel wearing kooky glasses to save the day, which he of course does by tempting the wife with modern home appliances.
Fortunately, this video has one saving grace, the classic ""Is This Love?"" short.  Peggy and her man decide to marry after three months of dating; her parents want her to wait a year to finish school, but she throws a temper tantrum and elopes.  For contrast, we have Peggy's college roommate Liz, a 50-year old Romulan woman, and her goofy boyfriend Andy.  These old-fashioned (and just plain old) kids are taking the traditional route to marriage, waiting until school is over and they are sure they are compatible.  There are plenty of humorous comments in this one.
All in all, this is a fairly weak collection of MST3K shorts.  There are some funny bits throughout, of course, but they are relatively few and far between.  The first two volumes of MST3K shorts are more enjoyable, but any MSTie will definitely want to add Volume 3 to his/her collection, as well.",1030233600,11,3315,4.6239316239316235
956615,5,6305038619,"Many MSTies will agree with me when I say that the short films are often funnier and more enjoyable than the featured movies the Satellite of Love inhabitants are forced to watch.  Among the seven shorts collected in this initial volume are some of the funniest ones produced by Best Brains.  Of course, most of these productions are pretty funny to begin with, and one gains much insight into the America which produced these silly, seemingly unnecessary educational/informational videos.  Body Care and Grooming, a true MST3K classic, immediately comes to mind.  Did teenagers in the 1950s really have to be introduced to the concept of grooming and shown by way of video examples the steps involved in such a process?  Apparently so, if this video is any indication.  Of course, it also includes a subtle connotation that young people should all look and act a certain way, prompting the sagacious Crow to comment that ""expressing individualism is just plain wrong"" in reaction.  A Date With Your Family (referred to on the SOL as The Woody Allen Story) is a similar, yet even weirder little short which the guys rip into gleefully.  While it makes the case that a family should come together every night to enjoy each other's company over dinner, it essentially implies that a woman's place is in the home; the women, it declares, seem to feel as if they owe it to the men to look relaxed, rested, and attractive at dinnertime.  With comments from the narrator such as ""the boys greet Dad as if they are genuinely glad to see him"" (necessarily implying that they are not), this short is hilarious in and of itself, but it is made even funnier by comments from the guys (such as Servo's classic line ""A violent argument erupts about whose day was more pleasant"").  The Home Economics Story is another endorsement of female domestication from the 50s which the guys do a great job of humorously criticizing.  If the girls are supposed to dream no higher than home economics, the boys aren't offered the grandest of options, either, as Why Study Industrial Arts? reveals.  Chicken of Tomorrow introduces us to the birth, life, and deaths of the nation's chickens, presented in purely economic terms.  It is a rather involved process, prompting Mike to wonder why eggs don't cost about $100 apiece, but its purpose is unclear; after all, did men and women need to be sold on eating chicken and eggs?  Junior Rodeo Daredevils is probably the funniest short on this tape.  The only thing funnier than watching youngsters being thrown from horses and bulls in a rodeo is hearing the reactions from Joel and the Bots about the physical effects of such events.  For me, though, the true gem here is Cheating.  This video alone seems to have some merit, but the stiff acting and monotonous delivery of lines leaves this short wide open to hilarious assault by our more than able crew of cynics and jokesters. Breaking this video of 92 minutes down, we have two shorts with Joel and five with Mike; all of them are quite enjoyable no matter how many times you see them.  Hosted by Tom Servo, this tape (and its two follow-up volumes) is a must-buy keeper for all MSTies.",1030060800,14,3163,4.740875912408759
956616,4,6305038619,"This one had a lot of laugh out loud moments. The only one I thought was boring was ""The selling wizard"" Mike and the 'bots were trying their darndest to find something,anything funny about this one. My favorite riff in the short ""Is this love?"" (They think that marriage is all about hand holding and gazing into each others eyes. Mike-It's the stench of amonia from the piles of [feces] filled diapers!).""Design for Dreaming"" was the weirdest thing I've ever seen it made me laugh so hard(Mike-will someone please invent Rock and Roll?)",1025049600,2,538,4.795698924731183
956617,3,6305038619,"I love MST3K and especially the shorts. This collection features 7 rather dated and odd snippets of life in the last century:
Speech -- Using Your Voice: The host of this educational short for executives who don't know how to speak in public is a bit of a car wreck, but nothing too gut splitting here.
Aquatic Wizards: Nothing to see here. Not even skin. But there's a few good lines sprinkled around.
Is This Love?: Featuring what must be the oldest college co-ed ever, it's the prudes versus the swingers. Okay, but not too high on the amusement scale.
Design for Dreaming: This is the bright gem of the tape -- a bizarre mix of modern dance, push-button appliances, and autos of the future. ""Ahhhh! The bridge to the future is out!!!!"" Very very funny, almost as good as my fave, Mr. B Natural (not on this tape). This short alone is just about worth getting the video.
The Selling Wizard: Yikes! Plastic magic scary smiling woman selling freezer units!
Out of This World: Why an angel and devil would care about a bread salesman is beyond me. A few good moments and laughs.
Once Upon a Honeymoon: If someone can explain what the point of this short is, I'll give them money. Some funny spots.
So, that's them. Nothing too hysterically funny, but well worth the few bucks for the tape. A must for any die-hard Satellite of Love junkies.",1009238400,19,1340,4.541322314049586
956618,5,6305038619,"For sustained entertainment value, it's hard to beat the MST3K shorts, and some of the series' very best are on this video. If I could give it six stars, I would.
'The Home Economics Story' and 'Why Study Industrial Arts?' are propaganda for these underappreciated subjects, while 'A Date with Your Parents' encourages young people to make time for the folks who are paying your way through life, you little ingrates. 'The Chicken of Tomorrow' is an awe-inspiring look at advances in the world of poultry science, while 'Junior Rodeo Daredevils' shows us future poultry scientists risking their necks for prizes and acclaim. 'Cheating' and 'Body Care and Grooming' discuss, well, cheating and grooming (apparently the former is bad, the latter good).
The Best Brains (the folks behind MST3K) seem to have been able to pack as much comedy into a short as they sometimes did into an entire full-length film. This video highlights some of their best work, and features new host segments by Tom Servo. If you or the MSTie you love don't have this yet, get it right away!",1007337600,24,1066,4.862637362637362
956619,5,6305038619,"I have no idea why this one is unavailable, but it shouldn't be.

Not only are the shorts fun for us younger generation to watch, but those who actually saw them first-hand will enjoy re-watching them as well.  We watched the video with my boyfriend's parents (who are in their mid-50s), and they got a kick out of seeing the shorts now.

This imfamous short is known to Mysties as the greatest and yet the most disturbing. I laughed, to the point I almost fell out of my chair. Then I reflected on the crews words...was Mr B Natural a feminine man or a woman confused with her sexuality. The thought is perplexing. And I feel for that young boy, I do. Also on this video Is the short Out Of This World, a personal favorite as heaven and hell duke it out over a bread delivery man. Does the balance of good and evil rest with a nice fresh loaf of 'Stuff' bread?

956685,3,6305038619,"Okay, don't get me wrong here; any MST3K fan is going to love this.  If you're a freak who would do anything to see those two robots and the guy comment on stupid short subjects, this is the video for you.
However, some of the shorts are either too long and downright boring (the short about sorting ice cream immediately comes to mind).  Plus, after just seeing the hilarious ""Shorts Vol. 2"", this was very disappointing.  Most of the topics covered in this one aren't all that heavy-handed (like the hilarious train-crossing film in vol. 2).  They're mostly just kinda dumb.
Like I mentioned above, though, you'll still find enjoyment from this if you're a MST3K junkie.  Best shorts are ""Speech"", ""Land of Tomorrow"", and that totally stupid one about some angel who has to help a couple go on a honeymoon.

The other shorts featured on this video are ""Design for Dreaming,"" ""The Selling Wizard,"" ""Out of This World"", ""Once Upon a Honeymoon"", and ""Aquatic Wizards"".  The only thing that could've made it better, in my opinion, would've been the inclusion of ""Mr. B.

7881590,5,6305038619,"Back in the day when video stores ruled the land and broadband internet and movie piracy and netflix were all just a twinkle in someone's eye, this was my favorite mst3k to rent.

I don't think this was actually an episode.  I think it's a compilation of shorts that aired before different movies.  I never actually got to see mst3k on the air.

The shorts are among my favorites because they sidestep on of the few built in flaws in the mst3k model:  some of the movies they riff are so bad that they get kinda boring in places, and cracking jokes over it doesn't always make up for it.  none of these are really long enough to get tired of before they're done, and the change of scenery keeps it fresh.

For my money, the best short is the one about the girls going to college, and one of my favorite riffs in it is fairly subtle:  as one character hands another a wrapped package, one of the robots is making the same ticking noises you'd make to signify a cartoon bomb.",1424649600,,973,4.278688524590164
