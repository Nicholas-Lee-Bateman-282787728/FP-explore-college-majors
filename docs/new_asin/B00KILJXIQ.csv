6429839,5,B00KILJXIQ,"To clarify the title of my review, this series shows a lot of people dying in one horrendous form, or another - there is no scenic view of Naples but rather a series framed within the context of street level ghettoised crime and its tiered organisation from the pavement to the Don's chair. The audience is presented with the subtitled world of Gomorrah set in the Camorra, the Neapolitan crime consortium. A crime series where the viewer is given a narrative about external and internal power struggles between criminals and delinquents.

Originally, the book by Roberto Saviano was made into a film in 2008. The look and feel and the textures that make up Gomorrah do not look too dissimilar from the Baltimore of The Wire. Alternatively, for that matter, even the Brooklyn of the film Goodfellas. There are clichs and more clichs, in this crime drama. They are there precisely because they are part of the imagined landscape. The recent populist view of gangsters: they love their Mamas, they are foodies, they make the sign of the cross, they kiss one another on the cheek, and they are affectionate with their children. Nevertheless, they are cold-blooded and would as soon kill you as look at you. This is a series that is crude and ugly, and yet so startlingly realistic in its presentation. As the audience is immersed on a tour de force of sleazy backstreets, no-hope vandalised dwellings and indulgent apartments garishly furnished fresh from the set of Scarface, with mafia dons ill-gotten gains.

Largely the acting is spot on, However, the subtitling is rather suspect, in my opinion, as you wonder did they really say that. Like The Wire before it, Gomorrah is interested in long paced form of storytelling, and hence it is generally leisurely, which is why in this first set-up chapter we are given just glimpses of characters. We see Imma, Pietro's hard - dispassionate wife, as well as their son Gennaro. Poor Gennaro, who longs to be included in family business, well not just yet anyway, as his father says to him. ""Gennaro, you're my son."" ""You don't need chances.""

While his lieutenant Ciro has the guile to do what it takes to get what he wants, the pertinent question here is how far is he willing to go and how much does he want?",1441584000,,2254,4.744897959183674

The show is awesome, if you live in the US it takes like forever to get here, then to convert it is another thing. I got this for my Italian uncle that lives here. He's now addicted to the show, he's chomping at the gills for season 2.",1491177600,,338,3.7746478873239435

6429847,5,B00KILJXIQ,"Gomorrah is one badass show. This series was on the Sundance Channel, but I wanted to watch it without the endless commercial interruptions. The restaurant scene about knocked me off my sofa. It gave new meaning to the concept of Urban Warfare. If you liked the Sopranos, go for it.",1486944000,6,282,4.66
6429848,5,B00KILJXIQ,"I don't know if I can wait for Sundance to air the second season; I may have to get it sooner.  After watching this, I bought the book by Staviano & hope to read it soon.  And I'll probably watch the 2008 movie, too.

The show is dark and gritty; the producers are not whitewashing brutality.  Admittedly, there were some scenes that made me gag a little bit, but I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen.  Because of the dramatic portrayals and because of sub-titles, I didn't want to miss a moment - a look, a sigh,a whispered word -  that might foreshadow future alliances or deaths.",1486598400,2,590,4.36697247706422
6429849,5,B00KILJXIQ,"With a few exceptions, puts to shame most of our American crime dramas. This is as brutal and unflinching and intense as the spectacular 2008 film. Capturing the look and tone of that movie, while as ambitious in production as a feature film, this series lives up to its billing as a visceral, Shakespearean saga of organized crime in Naples. For fans of The Sopranos and The Wire, Gomorrah will win you over and grip you until its climatic finish. Watch this show!",1486598400,,465,4.614457831325301

The storyline is riveting and the acting is excellent.  The cinematography creates that same dark, foreboding feeling that you get from watching Taxi Driver, and the narrative takes places you didn't expect and may not have wanted to go.  After seeing season 2, I cant wait for season 3 and 4.",1481760000,,460,4.922077922077922

6429884,5,B00KILJXIQ,"Tough, gritty demanding series that is Shakespeare-like in is characters. Not for the faint of hert, but wildly entertaining in its scope, and story telling.

The only real downside is that characters appear, and then disappear for extended periods, give the sweep of the tale being told.
It has great acting, superior drama, and a fast pace, Should never be viewed by children. Definitely adults only.",1477094400,,402,5.090909090909091
6429885,4,B00KILJXIQ,"Very well done. Ciro's character is especially charismatic, but all of the actors make you forget that you're not watching real people go about their criminal business.

6429909,5,B00KILJXIQ,"Ole 'youngblood' complains and the ensuing seasons have yet to unfold. $20 is but 2 packets of smokes in Naples dudette. This is the series after fact series from the 2007  movie of the same name - an underground/unfully recognized gritty real life portrayal of life in Naples, IT.

I'm already into season 2 (from other sources) and it gets nasty - like life that I once knew of in Naples. Maria Pia Calzone was a hottie in season 1. Happy birthday Libra sister. She reminds me of an old girlfriend from mine, back-in-the-day.

Shared some specific snippets with my actual real life WIRE friend from Baltimore today. Great parallels as was his ""just like Baltimore dude"". Drug shiz is the same the world over. AND, we too do a whole bunch of drugs here in this country.

Kudo's to all the Italians involved in the production. Editing and voice translations missed some real grit, but that's normal in cross translation and regional dialect, specifically edited for time constraints and country censors.

Luv it! The cinematography and story line absolutely triggers sensors for those who have had ANY real life experiences with this type of gandra.  The misery, pain, death, deceit, supposed glory ... all of society's underbelly buttons are being touched with this series.

The 2007 film version was a classic keeper. So too is this series. Congrats - but Italy has already given ALL that to them before mine.

8659264,5,B00KILJXIQ,"Not your old fashion mafia series.  This television show is unique and different from any Italian Mafia crime drama I have ever seen.  It's gritty, violent without the grandiose, glamourous and pretentiousness of American mafia films.  It is far better than the original 2008 film it was based on.  It has plot twist and suspense in almost every episodes.  It has many different factions with both external and internal conflicts that threaten the crime clans control of the cocaine drug trade and the very existence of the clan itself.  The story builds up as you go through the season to an amazing climax that spans the last two episode with a cliffhanger and will have you thinking WTF just happened?

I can't wait to see what happens in season 2.  I'm sad this tv series only has two seasons.  I wish it had more seasons.  I didn't watch this season on Amazon so I'm not sure how it is presented here.  I watched it with the original Italian audio with English subtitles since I prefer hearing the real voices of the actors instead of dubbed soundtracks.
