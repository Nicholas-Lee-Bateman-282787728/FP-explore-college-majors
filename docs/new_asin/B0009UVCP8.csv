2322559,5,B0009UVCP8,"I love Julie Cox as an actress - her portrayed characters are always vibrant, interesting and believable.
Princess In Love is an adaptation into film with romance, good humor, a lot of touching moments.
The movie was made in 1996, while Diana was still alive and the worst tragedy, thankfully - is not the central point of the movie, which would totally kill this product.
I recommend this movie to viewers, who'd like to know how human royal families truly are.

P.S. If you're a fan of Julie Cox, you should have this movie, because (if I'm not mistaken) it's the only film with her as the lead.
If you're not - I might suggest reconsidering immediately. She looks and acts fantastically here and I recommend any movie you find with her. 2003 was a good year for her especially.

2322560,1,B0009UVCP8,"The honeymoon is definitely over for Charles and Diana; she's bored, frustrated, and lonely.  Then she meets a handsome army captain who becomes her riding instructor and then, her lover.  Five years later, they part under sad circumstances.

This made-for-TV movie is really awful.  No attempt was made to make the actors look anything like their famous counterparts:  Diana doesn't have her trademark hairstyle (or any sense of style at all), Hewitt, Fergie, and Prince Harry aren't redheads, and Charles is a foot taller than Diana.  Both the trite script and the unconvincing actors are to blame for a total lack of chemistry between the lovers; everyone in the cast has the personality of a wet rag, giving the movie a completely lackluster quality.

There are some beautiful, grand houses and sets as backdrops, but the story is tawdry and surprisingly tedious.  It's based on a book to which Hewitt was a major contributor, so of course, he comes out a hero while Diana is an emotional mess.  Not recommended.",1250467200,12,1016,4.929411764705883

2322562,2,B0009UVCP8,This movie had to do with Princess Dianas' life & a very personal matter.  I found I was not interested in this story at all & I would not recommend it to anyone..Another way to make money on a young womens' tragic life.,1223251200,3,220,4.116279069767442
2322563,5,B0009UVCP8,"This is a tv-based movie that shows from the late Diana, Princess of Wales' perspective her feelings of loneliness, despair, and isolation that she felt towards her husband.

Critically judged by ""The Firm"" as Princess Diana referred to them as, she felt alone, that is, until she began riding horses again and meets Captain James Hewitt.

Sadly, while this is an excellent movie, the ending is...

Well, you will have to see it for yourself!",1214870400,,442,4.866666666666666
2322564,2,B0009UVCP8,"Charles and Diana are putting up a brave front, pretending to be happily married in front of the cameras, while privately fed up with each other.  She says he doesn't want to spend time with the boys; he retreats to his lover's arms for sympathy.  Enter handsome, sympathetic Captain James Hewitt who becomes Diana's riding instructor, and soon they begin a torrid affair that spans years.  Gradually, however, her neediness starts to stifle him and he sells his kiss-and-tell story to the media.

This could have been a much better soap-opera story, but the actors who play Diana (Julie Cox) and Charles (Christopher Bowen) are horribly miscast.  She looks and acts like a high school student in a bad senior play, while he just seems to wander aimlessly through scenes.  Christopher Villiers, as Hewitt, is spot-on however; he's sexy and charming and seems quite the type to sweep a young princess off her feet.

This is generally a pretty lifeless retelling of Hewitt's book; there are no sparks or surprises, no juicy-gossipy bits to titillate the viewer.  There's just the sad story of a marriage that should never have been and a man who (by this account) was innocentlyly drawn in to satisfy the needs of a bored wife.  Mediocre at best.",1209168000,12,1244,4.830188679245283
2322565,5,B0009UVCP8,I have watched quite a few things on Diana since her death and enjoyed watching all of them she was a very interesting woman i am very confused why she would stay in a marriage with a man like Charles he seemed like a very uncaring man.,1189382400,8,236,4.042553191489362
2322566,5,B0009UVCP8,I found this movie very interesting.  I didn't know that it existed but had read the book that came out prior to the movie.  I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any Diana fan.,1166659200,7,186,4.138888888888889
8066951,1,B0009UVCP8,"Julie Cox was sadly miscast as Diana. She's tiny. Sometimes it was laughable, like a miniature person. Diana always had a presence, in part because of her height. I saw her once, at a distance  around Rockefeller Center in NYC, she was striking. Maybe if they'd cast all small people it could have been a theme, like a doll house version of a famous mansion. And couldn't they find any blonde and ginger boys to play her sons. I didn't even know that her friend was supposed be Fergie, who always provided comic relief back then with her red hair, weight problems and antics. This was a very dull Fergie. This film was so bad I couldn't even have a laugh making fun of it.",1517097600,,672,4.376

8066953,1,B0009UVCP8,A film to discredit Diana. Listen to Diana's interview where she states that there were three in the marriage from the very beginning. This film was made to lie to the public. I suspect she was murdered by the monarchy...,1510617600,,221,4.55

8066958,3,B0009UVCP8,"I felt that much of it was one sided. I believe this movie was made right after lots of interviews with the Royal Family and after Di's death. So, a one sided presentation. Charles was the one you tended to feel sorry for in the film and that was not the way it was during their marriage before their divorce. While, I'm sure she had her problems, there were lots of issues she stood for that are not well represented in this film. It would have been better with a fuller character development of Di, if it was more balanced.  The film seems to have suffered on many fronts by the one-sided presentation.",1490227200,3,604,4.345132743362832
