8440491,5,B004T4LYM6,"Nin Nin (not to be mistaken by La blue girl's character) is a great family movie in the tradition of the Doraemon anime. Having an anime of its own (which I have not seen nor need to enjoy the film) Nin Nin manages to tell a good story in little time.
Kanzo Hattori, an apprentice Ninja, leaves his home town of Iga for his final training. He must go to the city of Edo (Tokyo), and the first person he meets shall be his master, whom he must protect with his life, whilst upholding the ninja code.
Also while in Edo, Hattori must find out why their rivals, the Koga Ninjas, are flourishing while the Iga Ninjas are dying out. Hattori's master is Kenichi, a 9 year old boy. Which is very un-popular in school and his parents don't like or rather can't spend much time with him. Nin Nin, as his servant, tries very hard to help the young boy start believing in himself.  However evil ninjas lurk to finish both Nin Nin as his young master. How it will end? You'll have to see it to know...overall if you want a good children's movie with good moral lessons this is for you.",1300665600,,1072,4.254901960784314
