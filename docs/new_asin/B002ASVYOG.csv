3892429,2,B002ASVYOG,"I'm not sure what's wrong with me, but I didn't like this DVD much at all. I own several other 10 Minute Solutions and they are all hit or miss but this one is definitely a miss.

I have been dancing since 4 years old: jazz, ballet, tap, ballroom, and yes, hip hop and I just could not enjoy this DVD.
I found the choreography confusing and a little disjointed. The moves did not seem to run into each other very well and I found the footwork and arm movements not complimentary at all. Very often I could do one and not the other. I tried the whole disc twice, and just couldn't pull it off. I felt awkward all the way through.

There were only 2 sections I halfway enjoyed, but 2 out of 5 isn't really that good.

I must say the instructor is likeable but I just didn't enjoy her routines. I think I will stick to Jennifer Galardi's dance DVDs they are much better.

To those who like it though, enjoy! It must be me, I must be missing something.",1258934400,6,948,4.135869565217392
3892430,4,B002ASVYOG,"This CD has 5 - 10 minute workouts to choose from. All of them are fun, what I would call low impact, and you can tell you are working muscles! I am 40+ and love the hip-hop theme. I have been doing 2 workouts back to back for 3 weeks and I am seeing results. I must say that the moves are sasy to do when she is showing them to you, but I know I look ridiculas when she brings the moves up to speed.  After doing them a few times however it gets better, and my family has quit laughing at me.  Haven't tried my moves out in a club yet but my daughter-in law says I'm almost ready!",1255046400,2,581,3.793388429752066
3892431,4,B002ASVYOG,"Kristin Jacobs did a great job here. She's friendly, encouraging, energetic who speaks clearly w/great cuing & she can actaully dance. She has such enthusiasm & love of dance, it keeps you going, unlike other dvds that you can see the instructor is tired or doesn't like to workout that can make you tired as well.
This is 5 ten minute workouts teaching you hip hop w/Kristin breaking it down to simple step touches or slides or kicks & then building up the lower body & then adding the arms. By always keeping you moving, you are never bored & you are always practicing even as you learn more.
She chose the more energetic moves of hip hop w/the arm movements, it's only slightly watered down to be easy to follow w/such constraints in time, but Kristin makes it easy to follow, that if you don't get it the first time, you still know what to do & will have it down in no time. There is a few times I had to hit slow-mo, but considering such time limits, she does a beautiful job in pace of keeping you moving without leaving you standing there lost.
I wish all dance workout dvds kept to this formula, some disappointingly either keep to such easy & boring moves that need no breakdown, or else just show you once quick in normal tempo, practice a few times & move on to a totally different move leaving you confused. I only have liked those that kept to this formula.
I'm not sure I'd go as far to say this is fine for first timers to dance dvds unless they can dance at least decently naturally, but this is great for anyone else.

Check Collagevideo for more video clips & reviews
Also, TotalFitnessDvds does longer video clip segments in the future, I'm sure they will do it for this one in the future.",1254787200,,1708,4.35423197492163
3892432,5,B002ASVYOG,"Since having a baby and not being able to get out to my usual hip hop classes, I decided to buy Kristin Jacobs' Hip Hop Dance Mix and this is the most fun I've had in a long time.  She looks amazing, has a great energy and vibe about her and the best part is that I have the option to do as little as 10 min. or as much as an hour of working out, which is great for a first time mom like myself.  Her moves are fun and easy to pick up, her cues are right on and I feel like she is so personable, she makes me want to get up off the couch and groove.  Can't wait for more videos from her.",1251158400,20,587,3.606299212598425
3892433,4,B002ASVYOG,"Yes, I'll admit that I'm being careful with certain ""slides"" and other moves because I have carpet.  However, I think this is at least worthy of four stars just for Kristin's energy and personality alone.  (I like the fact that she speaks loudly and clearly with a genuine non-stop smile.)  I'm really enjoying the video and I've only used two of the workouts so far.  I use videos like this one primarily for good warm-ups for my kettlebell routines, not for my heavy cardio days.  That said, the music and moves are fantastic and her cuing is spot on.  She makes me want to go out and dance, which I haven't done in years :-); the fun factor is extremely high.  She did a great job and I look forward to using this one again and again.",1249948800,12,737,4.335766423357664
3892434,4,B002ASVYOG,This was a nice surprise.  It gives you a good workout.  Kristin is not annoying.  She gives good cues.  This is not for people who have trouble dancing but for me it was very enjoyable,1443657600,,185,4.2
3892435,3,B002ASVYOG,this is a hard workout to get into its really fast and hard to follow,1443052800,,69,3.6666666666666665
3892436,5,B002ASVYOG,"I love this workout. It's easier on the joints than Zumba, but just as fun!",1433808000,,75,4.066666666666666
3892437,3,B002ASVYOG,"I think the moves aren't too difficult but what I don't like are the twisting of the feet and ankles.  I had a partial tear to my tendon in my ankle so maybe I am a little sensitive to these issues anyway, But this video is full of these moves. I saw the reviewer mention her knee being bothered.issues Anyone who is vulnerable to spraining ankles needs to be aware. I actually knew someone who broke their ankle doing Zumba for those of you who I think I am crazy. And no she wasn't a little old lady.  I have done hip hop before and don't remember the crazy foot moves.",1425254400,,571,4.135135135135135
3892438,4,B002ASVYOG,"As with any dance workout, it will take a couple of times to get these routines down.  The first time I did it, I was lost.  Then the second and third times - I had no problem following along.  Also, dance workouts (or any workout really) gives back what you put in.  You really need to get down to pant and sweat to these.

I agree with the person who said the knees take a hit on this type of workout, but it's so worth it.  I just wear a brace and make sure I'm landing lightly and moving correctly",1423180800,,501,3.96

3892443,4,B002ASVYOG,"This instructor is very good.  I will say however, I am not exactly as flexible as she is and some of the movements are difficult for me to achieve.  However, if I modify the movements, I do ok.  The instructor is very enthusiastic and gives good instruction.  Of course, please see a doctor before beginning any strenuous exercise.",1405814400,,332,4.672413793103448
3892444,3,B002ASVYOG,"I liked the idea of this but if you're
No dancer like me you're likely to find it hard. I'm afraid I  gave up after A couple of quick tries :(",1403481600,,142,3.5806451612903225
3892445,3,B002ASVYOG,Returned.  I like the 10 minute solutions however I have had to steer away because they are just not a good enough workout for me.  She had good dance moves and those were definitely not beginner moves but the workout itself did not bring me to much of sweat at all and I sweat A LOT when working out,1395964800,,300,4.067796610169491
3892446,5,B002ASVYOG,"I'm a fan of the 10-minute solution exercise videos, this is the second one I own.  I tried it out first by renting it from Netflix, and I really liked the first two exercises.  Since then, I've bought it and have tried the 3rd and 4th ten-minute exercises, and those are pretty good too.  To me, it's just a fun way to get in some exercise around the house.  The time goes by really quickly and the instructor is great (not annoying).",1390780800,,435,4.2682926829268295

3892451,4,B002ASVYOG,"I'm a 50-something women with a dance background (jazz, ballroom mostly). I've enjoyed this video workout. As a working mom, a 10-minute workout is feasible. In fact, I have so much fun with it that I usually let it play for an additional 5-10 minutes.",1360886400,,252,4.622222222222222
3892452,5,B002ASVYOG,I had checked this out from the local library and liked it so much I wanted to buy it so I would not have to turn it in. I read a lot of reviews of DVDs of other instructors and agreed with those reviewers that this instructor was very good. The workouts are of different intensity and the ability to put segments together really helps the workout. The price was reasonable and the product arrived in a timley manner.,1360454400,,417,4.291139240506329
3892453,2,B002ASVYOG,"I was hoping for songs that I knew or at least songs with words to get me pumped up.  It's just kind of lame, hip hop sounding music.",1360368000,,133,3.75
3892454,3,B002ASVYOG,"Let me start by saying that my fitness level is a negative three. I became quite obese during years of being disabled and am now in the process of losing the weight. I found these workouts to be pretty low impact and easy to complete. The instructor explains the moves clearly and doesn't overwhelm non-dancers with technical terms. Do a couple of workouts and your heart rate will go up and you'll even manage to break a sweat. The problem for me is that I was bored to death. I chose a dance workout DVD because I wanted to be engaged and have fun as motivation to actually DO the exercise. Even though the instructor has plenty of energy without being chirpy or annoying, I never connected with her, the music or the routines. This DVD is okay but it won't be in heavy rotation in my workout schedule.",1358899200,,804,4.402684563758389
3892455,5,B002ASVYOG,"10 Minute Solution: Hip Hop Dance Mix is a great workout. When I was younger, my siblings and I would make up dance routines and compete with eachother. This video brings back those wonderful memories. I am a 300+ lb. woman and I love, love, love this video, I didn't find it hard at all. The only thing that caught me off guard was the punch and twist, the swizzle (at first) and the hip pop. BUT NOT ANYMORE! I really like the fact that she takes things step by step and then turns it up by looping the routines together. I found that after the 2nd time doing the video, I was very familiar with the moves and it became easier to follow. I would really get down to power up my workout. Getting LOW, popping HARD and NOT STOPPING, thats the key. Really dance, don't be a robot. And just when I was about to hit the wall, the 10 minutes would be over. I did the whole video the first time, and everytime since because it was fun and I just couldn't wait to dance again. My oldest sister introduced this video to me, and I have recommended it to my twin sis, my neighbors and others. I LOVE IT!!!! Cant wait to go home and work out!!!! THIS IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!! My sisters and I joke about taking these moves to the club, HEY WE JUST MIGHT..... LOL.

I found the instructor to be funny, and kept me motivated. She was really into it and I really liked that about her. Especially when she would say ""YUUUUP!!!!""",1350950400,,1421,4.167272727272727
3892456,5,B002ASVYOG,This DVD is awesome it really works and its a lot of fun.  You don't even realize you are exercising but can work up a sweat quick.,1348012800,,131,3.8518518518518516
3892457,1,B002ASVYOG,"This video is so difficult to take seriously as a hip hop video!

PROS:
1) Some of the moves look like hip hop. If you are a beginner, you could pick up a few moves...if you could get past all of the cons.

CONS:
1) The instructor is so smiley, perky, and has a super cheerful voice.  This can be a great quality in general, but it definitely does not match the style of dance at all.  Her outfits are very cheesy and distracting.  This would make a great aerobics or cheerleader instructor, but doesn't work for hip hop.

2) The setting looks like a new yoga studio-grey walls, bright lights, white 70s chair, modern art, yoga balls, smooth wood floor.  The dancing style does not match.  Again, very distracting.

3) The music is not real hip hop.  The instructor talks the entire time, and that with the music, the video would be greatly enhanced with the volume muted and my own music in the background.

4) Most of the moves are not good hip hop moves.

I have the video playing right now, and the more I watch it, the more I feel like I'm watching a cheerleader squad learning a new routine.  I just muted it and it's already better!

Summary: If someone else in a better setting with better outfits was doing some of the same moves, it might be believable as hip hop.  It's just so hard to tell with everything else that makes me dislike it so much.

*Sadly, I purchased this video after reading all of the other great reviews.  I thought that it sounded great.  It just goes to show you how not everyone is looking for the same thing.  This is definitely NOT what I was looking for.  I am a 30 year old woman who loves to dance, but has never taken any formal dancing, so I thought this would be a fun way to learn a few real moves.  NOT SO!",1337212800,,1749,4.22356495468278
3892458,5,B002ASVYOG,"Excellent and fun DVD for exercise and learning a new dance. There are 5 different segments, all 10 minutes each and the instructor is fabulous.",1331856000,,144,4.8
3892459,5,B002ASVYOG,"I enjoyed this DVD thoroughly.
It was so much fun and the time goes so fast I would not hesitate to purchase any others in the series.
It's great to work out in your own home and you don't have to worry about being embarrassed at the gym!",1330473600,,238,3.9791666666666665
3892460,5,B002ASVYOG,"I love this DVD. Each workout is fun and Kristin Jacobs is an upbeat and friendly instructor. She breaks down the steps so they are easy to do - they will take some practice if you're like me and haven't done any dance exercises in a while, but don't let that inhibit you. It's truly fun and effective and the music is great, a good beat without being too ""hip hop"". Meaning, it's not rap, it's good, modern music with a good beat that syncs well with the workout. Give it a try. I loved it and I'm sure you will, too.",1330128000,,518,4.088235294117647
3892461,5,B002ASVYOG,"This video is a blast. It's the first exercise video I've ever looked forward to doing each day, and that I sincerely have fun with. The moves in each segment might seem complicated the first time through, but each step builds on the one before. I'm fortunate that I'm good with patterns, so to me it was easy to pick up.

The music is very basic - just simple hip hop beats that repeat through each segment. The music is different for each segment, and it fits well with the moves. It's nothing special, but it doesn't bother me.

Also, I'm not likely to bust many of these moves out in a club. For me it's just about having fun moving around and burning some calories. :)

If you have restricted movement, this is probably not the best choice, as you'll be jumping around and moving every part of yourself. If you're looking for something that has an element of dance and engages your whole body, this is a good option.",1328918400,,921,4.374269005847953
3892462,5,B002ASVYOG,"Upbeat and fun. Gets you moving and working, it is a good workout. Its nice that it is in 10 min segments :)No problems with this product.",1327449600,,138,4.148148148148148
3892463,4,B002ASVYOG,"I've exercised to the Hip Hop dance mix several times now.  I enjoy the change up from regular workouts, but my work out often takes about 30 minutes.  I was not gifted with quickly learning dance steps.  For me, it takes repetition and time to play the move out in my mind.  I find myself watching the steps, performing the steps, stopping the DVD and repeating the steps until I fully understand them.  Once I get to that point, I rewind and start over from the beginning of the step.  I definitely get a better workout since I'm not talented in picking up the dance steps quickly.

Pros:
 - good workout
 - easy to execute steps
 - fun in that it is a different way to work out

Cons:
 - None - other than I'm not a quick learner of dance steps",1326499200,,747,4.183098591549296
3892464,1,B002ASVYOG,"This was one of the worst workout videos I have ever done!  The instructor is very cheesy and the moves are silly, awkward, and out of date.  When I selected a hip-hop video I wanted to have a REAL hip-hop routine that happened to work me out, not a workout video with silly choreography that is pretending to be hip-hop moves!  When will they ever get a real hip-hop dancer to do one of these workout videos rather than an exercise guru??  What a waste of 10 dollars!!",1319673600,2,469,4.295454545454546
3892465,2,B002ASVYOG,"Although I generally enjoy the ""10 Minute"" series, this one just wasn't for me.  I  have bad knees, and there are too many twisting moves in these routines that could cause me injury.  I noted that the days after doing this workout, my knees would ache. I finally put two and two together and started substituting for those moves, but that kind of defeats the purpose.

I also found I never worked up much of a sweat with this one and did not hit my target heart rate.  This is likely due to the fact I could never quite pull off the moves, what with my knees, my carpeted floor, and the fact that I am not coordinated enough to get the upper and lower body moves to mesh well.

Not only was this workout a disappointment physically, I didn't seem to have as much fun doing these moves as I do some of my other workouts.  The dances just didn't flow for me.  I seem to do much better with my other 10 Minute mixes.  There is nothing wrong with the instructor. She is enthusiastic and fresh (if a bit fast paced), but this was just not the right DVD for me.

3892470,5,B002ASVYOG,"*This is a women's review*

My husband had got this DVD for me after previewing a lot of them on-line. I ended up buying 3 different 10 min solutions ('Hip Hop' w/ Kristin Jacobs, 'Dance It Off & Tone It Up' w/ Jennifer Galardi, and 'Dance Your Body Thin' w/ Andrea Leigh) and that is the order that I like them! Kristin Jacobs is very fun and easy to follow. Unlike other reviews, her moves will eventually be easier for you to do and they will flow together. I've never danced before, so this was new to me- but by the 3rd time I was pretty much following along step for step! The sections are fun, and I actually look forward to dancing- and yes, it is dancing.. unlike the 'Dance Your Body Thin' video which feels more like a step class with some wavy arms added in. Also, while the music isn't my favorite ever- it serves the purpose and is funky and fun. This video is fun, tricky at first, and a great workout!

Also, I am a plus sized woman (over 250lbs)- and I have been able to keep up just fine. Plus- doing this workout has been helping me shed the pounds without realizing it! I hope Kristin Jacobs does more hip hop dance videos!!",1281052800,30,1144,4.219178082191781

I found it very contemporary and fairly easy to follow. These are the kinds of moves u can easily take to the dancefloor! All sections are different and you sweat just as equally in all of them. The only ""bad"" thing I find is that they don't stretch u out in the end, u just inhale a couple of times and ur done, so stretching before and after are all u. Other than that, this video is great to get some hip hop feeling in ur moves!",1280448000,2,616,3.8503937007874014

3892473,4,B002ASVYOG,"I liked that this DVD was fun and different.  There are 5 10 minute workouts and the DVD lets you pick and choose which workouts, how many, and in which order.  This is an awesome feature!  Each workout consists of 2 routines and then a brief cool down.  Kristen Jacobs does a good job of teaching the moves, starting with feet and leg moves and then adding arms.  Sometimes it was difficult to do both the feet work and the arms at the same time so I would do just the feet until I had that down before adding the arms.  This seemed to be somewhat low impact and I'm pretty out of shape.  I did work up a sweat but it didn't having me panting either.  But, I think the more I do the workouts and memorize them I'll be able to start focusing on making it higher impact as opposed to focusing on doing to moves properly.  I wish that a couple of the workouts would've only had 1 routine and allowed for more time to do the whole routine repeatedly.  Otherwise, I thought it was fun and I'll keep using this DVD!",1271462400,,1010,4.133333333333334
3892474,4,B002ASVYOG,"This is a fun dance workout DVD.  A little corny, but some corniness can be a good thing.  The choreographies are reasonably easy enough, though you could have some trouble if you aren't familiar with dance.  As with any DVD, whether basic aerobics or  dance-related, if you have trouble with the choreography, it's best to work with just the footwork patterns and add the arm movements on once you get the hang of it.

The only problem I really had with this DVD is the large amount of knee twists.  It's very easy to torque your knee with some of these combos.  I found that ""Body Re-Mix"" and ""Cardio Street Heat"" were especially rough on my knee joints.

So, in a nutshell, if you enjoy dancing and want to get some cardio, this is a good choice.  Just be sure to watch out for your knees!",1267056000,9,792,4.36986301369863

3892478,4,B002ASVYOG,"I got this DVD for Christmas and I've been really enjoying it. Some dance workout DVDs I've done before have been frustratingly hard to follow (I'm looking at you, Dancing With The Stars Latin Dance Cardio), but this is one has been a lot easier to get. I really like the way she starts with a simple step with just the legs/feet, then adds arms, and then once you practice that a few times, adds on from there. It makes it much easier to catch on to the steps quicker. In addition to being easy to learn, the dances are a lot of fun and I definitely work up a sweat doing them.
I also really like the setup of the disc--there are 5 workouts, each ten minutes, and you can mix and match them however you want. Do as many or as few as you want, in whatever order you want. It's a great setup really, because while it can be hard to get motivated to exercise, most anyone can commit to 10 minutes, and I find that once I start it's so fun that I just want to do more.
My only complaint is really not so specific to this DVD as to all exercise DVDs, but I can't help being annoyed when the instructor talks to me like she can see me. ""You're doing great!"" ""I had so much fun with you today!"" I don't get why they all do this...I guess at some point, someone found that strategy to be affective with some people, but I just can't get into that kind of thing. It just adds an element of insincerity. But oh well, I think she's a good teacher other than that and it doesn't stop me from wanting to do the DVD so whatever.
Anyway, I definitely recommend this DVD for anyone who likes dancing and is looking for a fun, simple way to get exercise.",1263081600,12,1638,4.090062111801243
3892479,4,B002ASVYOG,"I didn't realize that there was more than one Hip Hop dance! This DVD does an excellent job in incorporating hip hop dance into 5 options. Dance is a great cardio workout as experienced from this DVD.  Kristin is a perky and enthusiastic instructor.  Her instructional cues and direction is quite good. I would recommend this to an intermediate-advanced.  It's a fun atmosphere: Kristin has cute outfits to show off her toned arms and tummy, the music is perfect.  10 minute solution continues to produce well-done and impressive DVDs.",1262217600,,535,4.977528089887641

3892481,5,B002ASVYOG,"I've found the ""10 Minute Solution"" brand of DVDs to always be quite amazing, and this DVD was no different.  It is focused on cardio hip-hop dance moves that were very fun to do in addition to being aerobic.  The instructor, Kristin Jacobs, made the segments so much fun with her vibrant personality and likable teaching, adding enjoyment to the workout!  She teaches, not by slowing down the moves, but rather she teaches the feet first before then adding the arms.  It's not a DVD for absolute beginners, but people with some background in exercise or dance should be able to catch on relatively quickly.  Like other ""10 Minute Solution"" dance DVDs this was was broken into 5 10-minute segments, but different from the other dance DVDs these segments were then broken down into 2 5-minute routines, all in all creating 10 little routines.  I didn't find too much variation in the styling of each different 10 minute segment, although I did see that each segment contains a hint of flair from b-boy, jazz funk, and krump style.  Overall, I really enjoy and recommend this DVD to exercisers who love to dance; I don't think it will be a regretted buy!",1260748800,,1152,4.701492537313433
3892482,2,B002ASVYOG,"Unfortunately, this CD was not the right choice for me. I wish there was a way to preview it online first and I would have seen that the music is too fast and not to my liking. She shouold have spent a little time instructing the steps in slow motion first and then speed it up.",1259280000,,278,3.982142857142857
3892483,5,B002ASVYOG,"Great DVD. I have many dance DVD's for exercise and I really love them all, but this has to be one of my favorites. Easy to learn moves, funky and fun. Each 10 minutes seems more like 3 minutes and before I know it, I've done the full 50 minute workout. Would definately recommend to dancers and non-dancers. Have a blast.",1259020800,5,322,4.295081967213115

8360359,4,B002ASVYOG,"Was looking for quick exercise programs to use in bits of time whenever convenient for me. I was actually looking for 30 minute shows but came across this one and decided to give it a shot. I really like that I can either do 10 minutes or I can do more...just by moving on to the next. I'm looking to get back into shape and I need something fun or I'm done. I use to go to the gym and enjoyed it , but I'm not enjoying it at this point. So I thought if I could get a few dance workouts it might pick me up and get me where I need to go and get some motivation moving. So the 10 minute solution is actually fun! I definitely am not a dancer and that's okay she just walks you through it. I liked that it was fun and I was sweating. I will say I did get a good laugh at myself trying these and my kids had a good laugh watching me!!! I couldn't get them to do it with me, but maybe at some point they will:)",1457222400,2,906,3.74869109947644
8360360,5,B002ASVYOG,"One of the best of the 10-minute video series. And fun. I find with the dance DVDs it's much easier to do one workout after another, therefore getting in a longer workout without struggling over it.",1450656000,,198,4.527777777777778
