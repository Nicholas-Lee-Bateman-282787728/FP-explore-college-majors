7977294,5,B00007K064,"MUSCLE EATS FAT is one of two ""full body"" DVDs in the Lotte Berk series (the other is BASIC ESSENTIALS) and is my favorite because of Barbara Boolukos, the almost 50 instructor.  If you are a woman in your forties, fifties, or beyond, this woman will truly motivate you with her no-nonsense approach to exercise, her unpretentious yet obvious strength, and her amazing flexibility.  The exercises are easy to learn and possible for anyone in good health and without major physical limitations to master.  I have problems with my shoulders, particularly my right one, which is rigid, but that doesn't prevent me from doing the exercises and the mandatory stretches, receiving the full benefit from both.  Until Barbara actually looks in the camera and says she is almost 50, you simply don't realize it because she looks so good.  She proudly tells us that a recent bone test to analyze her bone density revealed that she ""doesn't have a trace"" of osteoporosis.  I have to wonder about some younger women I see out on the streets of Washington, DC, jogging in all kinds of weather, high humidity, poor air quality, and everyday DC city air pollution.  They may look good for now, but in time they make suffer all kinds of joint problems, respiratory problems, aging skin due to overexposure to the sun, and sagging breasts that simply couldn't take all that bouncing up and down for very long.  Contrast that with Barbara Boolukos, our Lotte Berk instructor, who says she has been doing the Lotte Berk workout for 21 years and is slim and shapely, fit, and agile.  You can easily see why I prefer to take it easy on the cardiovascular exercise and instead get fit, lean, and young looking with this wonderful combination of yoga, Pilates, anaerobic exercise, ballet training moves, and physical therapy techniques.  Lotte Berk it is!  Thank you Ms. Boolukos and to this DVD's producers for an effective, do-able, and inspiring workout.",1183939200,4,1934,4.865853658536586
7977295,5,B00007K064,"I'm in my mid-30's and this is the first exercise video I ever bought because the model doing the backbend on the cover caught my eye, (I'm big on flexibility).  I'd never even heard of Lotte Berk before.  The editorials that wrote Lotte Berk is a good workout without breaking a sweat lied!  I sweat and my body parts trembled as I held on trying to get through the reps.  I'm very active and usually exercise outdoors (biking, jogging, hiking, kayaking) but Lotte Berk found muscles that I obviously wasn't using and I was impressed.  Lastly, I think the instructors are classy and I want to look as fit and sexy as they do so of course I bought the rest of the series.  Lotte Berk kicks butt!",1094342400,13,695,4.390625
7977296,4,B00007K064,"Based on the reviews, I had very high expectations for this video.  It's the only tape I have in the Lotte Berk series.  I don't think you can get the profound results they promise by only doing this tape.  There are very effective exercises within a short amount of time - each section is only 10 min. long.
I just felt it was expensive for such a short tape.
I believe in the Lotte Berk concepts - protecting your back and stretching your muscles.  You do get reminders and pointers about your back.  There are more in-between stretches in the lower body portion.  And, the ending stretch focuses more on the legs.  If you're looking for a short workout - it's excellent.
If they lowered the price, I'd buy more in the series.  If you're looking for a longer workout with strengthening and stretching, try Jennifer Kries.",1089676800,7,823,4.551020408163265
7977297,5,B00007K064,"I have been doing the Firm for a few years now and needed some variety.  I ordered this video a few months ago and it sat in my entertainment stand until today.  I really wanted to do something different and remembered i had this video.  So I tried it and I loved it.  It was very different and also fun.  The leg work was very challenging.  I also liked the instructor a lot and her helpers.  They all looked great.  I would recommend this video, it was quick and efficient.",1086652800,5,475,4.2
7977298,5,B00007K064,"When I ordered this video, I thought ""How hard could it really be--it's only 30 minutes long.""  But I found out even 30 minutes of Lotte Berk can be VERY hard.  The first 15 minutes is upper body work which was challenging but not ridiculously so.  (I'm an intermediate exerciser.) But the last 15 minutes of lower body work was really tough for me.  I try to do this video 2-3 times a week and I have really seen results.  My saddlebag thighs are starting to disappear and my upper leg muscles are looking longer and leaner.  I highly recommend this video.  It's 30 minutes that gets results!",1074470400,6,593,4.435185185185185
7977299,5,B00007K064,"The Lotte Berke Method is a non-traditional type of toning developed by a dancer of the same name. It emphasizes the creation of long, lean (not bulky) muscles through the use of small, precise movements, and it has inspired similar methods such as Callanetics.

In MUSCLE EATS FAT, the focus is on whole-body toning.  The workout begins with a warm-up, a type of high-legged marching in place, and includes simple stretches.  The first section targets the arms using light weights.  The movement are similar to traditional toning (eg, bicep curls and tricep extensions) but are made unique by both the preciseness of each movement as well as the use of the ""Lotte Berk tuck,"" an isometric stance which works the legs while working the upper body.  The arm section finishes on the floor with some tough plank moves which also work the buttocks.

The leg work comes next; although the moves are displayed using a ballet barre, a sturdy, high-backed chair works fine.  These exercises clearly derive from ballet and really target the thigh muscles.  Again, the Lotte Berk tuck is used to increase the work on both the legs and the hip area.  The final exercises for the lower body are done on a mat using the signature Lotte Berk movement, Knee Dancing--again, you will really FEEL this in your thighs.  The workout ends with a final stretch, although in the Lotte Berk Method, stretches are also woven throughout following each strength move.

The video is led by three Lotte Berk certified instructors.  The main instructor, Barbara, looks amazing for her age, which she says is close to 50.  She's a bit goofy in her comments (eg, repeatedly saying ""did you feel that?"" and ""I love this workout!""), but she provides good information and cuing.  The remaining two instructors do not speak, but one shows modifications.  The Lotte Berk Method is great for all exercisers who are looking for a different but challenging strength workout, including those at a beginning level.",1070582400,5,1973,4.900602409638554
7977300,5,B00007K064,"I have lost 70 pounds over the past year, and have used a variety of exercise videos - pilates, weights, aerobics, dance - and this video is different than anything else I have used.  For the first time in I don't know when, my leg muscles were shaking after completing this workout.  If you are an exercise buff, and are looking for something different, I highly recommend this video.  It is only a half hour long, which is shorter than most of my workouts, but believe me you will feel it.  If you love pilates, I am sure you will enjoy this video, but if you are mostly into aerobics, than this is probably not for you.  I plan on getting more Lotte Berk videos asap! : )",1049241600,23,674,4.234375
