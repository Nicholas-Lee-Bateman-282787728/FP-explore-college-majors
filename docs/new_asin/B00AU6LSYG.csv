8557858,4,B00AU6LSYG,"Fascinating new insight into the alien abduction phenomena. The speaker suggests, with witness testimony, that calling the name of Jesus can stop an alien abduction. I have never witnessed an alien abduction, or a UFO for that matter, but I have read David Jacobs book, and this lecture adds to the intrigue.
