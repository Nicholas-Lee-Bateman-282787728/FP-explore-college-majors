8462762,4,B0059676CA,"Someone has explained to me that ballet has its own language of movement, and a person who knows this language can follow the story very easily. I confess I do not know it. Fortunately, I know and love Shakespeare's play, or it ballet version would have been a complete and total mystery to me. (I also know French, so could follow the occasional dialogue in that language, which does not seem to be subtitled.) The ballet does not follow the play slavishly, but well enough. The child over whom Titania and Oberon have their quarrel seems to have been changed from a little boy to a pubescent young girl, which makes the situation even more interesting. In fact, I would have to venture the guess that this treatment dips into downright eroticism in more places than one. Bottom metamorphoses, but not into an ass's head. (In fact, it got a little confusing when they kept using the ""Hee-Haw"" theme from Mendelssohn in scenes that had neither the forest nor any of the rude players in them.) I got a little lost about who was given the love drops from the flower when; but that flower seemed inspired: a bloom of gauzy petals big enough that Puck rode around in it, dispensing the mystic stuff in the form of a vapor. Indeed, I purely loved the solidly ethereal sets and, for the most part, the imaginative costumes; and if we went by physical appearance only, these dancers could have played their characters in a straight production of Shakespeare's play. They costumed the Pyramus and Thisbe play so that it looked very much like ""Romeo and Juliet,"" which seems appropriate.
As intimated at the start, I am not a fan of the ballet, though have seen two or three over my lifetime that I've quite enjoyed. But I had a chance to get this disk at at a very good bargain, and the play is one of my great favorites. ""Le Songe"" isn't quite enough to make me a ballet aficionado, but neither am I willing to part with it now it's on my shelf. I find it visually stunning and quite hilarious in the places where it's supposed to be. If your chief interest is Mendelssohn's music, however, go for an orchestral CD: I feel fairly confident that the score they put together for this ballet would not make the best thing to listen to by itself.",1505865600,,2235,4.5073891625615765
8462763,2,B0059676CA,"This is Maillots version of Shakespeares Midsummer Nights Dream.  I found it interesting and imaginative, but not enjoyable.  Im open to new interpretations, but this was too frantic.  It was 80% Keystone cops (but not funny), 10% professional wrestling (the lovers were almost brutal), and 10% ballet.  The story was confusing and I had to resort to the written program to know what was going on.  (Youd never know that it was a donkey that Bottom that got turned into.)  The love scene between Titania and Bottom/Donkey seemed cruel.  The love scene between Titania and Oberon was weird, and possibly in poor taste.  I didn't think much of the added music and periods of silence either. Very little of it could be termed beautiful or pleasurable to the eye; whereas some modern dance is quite nice.  The supposedly humorous sequences with the artisans or rude mechanicals were just awful.  In summary, this is a waste of excellent dancing talent, particularly Nathalie Nordquist (Hermia), who was Odette/Odile in the Swedish Ballets superb Swan Lake.  How did she ever get into this turkey?",1459728000,,1092,4.9779005524861875

8462765,5,B0059676CA,"Of the three Maillot dvds I own (This, Romeo et Juliette, Cendrillon), this is the most successful in my opinion, and quite an achievement it is.  As a balletic interpretation of A Midsummer Night's Dream, it is stunning in its probity to Shakespeare:  As WS uses three different ""voices"" for the three distinct sets of characters (blank verse for the Athenian courtiers, rhymed verse for the fairies, prose for the ""rude mechanicals""), so Maillot uses three distinct choreographic styles for the three, plus three different composers to boot.  You can always count on Maillot to give you creativity, and he does so again here, starting with the Athenians all in white or grey and portrayed as statues come to life, complete with the name of each ""inscribed"" on the surface--a beautiful effect.  Their choreography is classical ballet.  The ""rude mechanicals"" are a hoot, with a mishmash of lowbrow choreographic styles to ""mechanical"" music.  Not to miss:  Bottom's solo early on, mindful in a ballet-sense of Wall-E.  Now for the twist:  Among the fairies, Oberon is a quasi-faun!  And, to complete the twist, when Bottom is transformed into an ass, that ""ass"" in fact looks quite sleek, much like Titania herself, and the visual opposite of the half-man, half-beast Oberon.  Fascinating!  And it works!  And here I just spoke of Maillot's ""probity to Shakespeare""--do I need to retract that?  I think not.  In my opinion he probes Shakespeare deeply here, more-or-less on the theme of ""opposites attract"":  So Oberon knows that Titania is not actually going to be attracted to someone sleek like herself.  At any rate, this ""twist"" certainly gets one to thinking, plus it adds to the dreaminess of it all.

Many wonderful effects here, and all supportive of the dream-like atmosphere:  Puck--puckish indeed--riding around at times in a Ginger within a giant flower blossom; Thisbe portrayed by a man in pointe shoes no less--a nod to the Trocks (quite decent pointe work, incidentally); the hilarious mechanicals' play at the end, putting the Athenians all to sleep; etc.  The acting is so good all-around that one can follow the story easily, I believe, even without any knowledge of Shakespeare's play. (!)

Have to say a word here about Bernice Coppieters (Titania):  She is always the centerpiece of Maillot's ballets and this ballet definitely plays to her (many) strengths.  She is strong, flexible, sensuous, sensual, stunning.  ""Icy hot"".  Additionally, you have to love Jeoen Verbruggen as Puck, Gaetan Morlotti as Bottom, Gioia Masala as Snug (what a gorgeous mouth!), Sarah Jane Medley as Hippolyta.  Well, actually, I do those a disservice whom I do not single out for mention here, as they are all excellent.  For shame:  None of these dancers/actors is identified in the accompanying booklet--the booklet is all ""Homage to Maillot""--; you can only get their names going by quickly in the end credits.

One last note:  As usual, Maillot ramps up the sexual aspect--true to Shakespeare, of course--and so this is a ballet for adults, not for children.  ""Songe"" means ""dream"" in French, and, if you want a version watchable by children, I definitely recommend Ashton's ""The Dream"".  But the two are entirely different.  I highly recommend this one.",1318204800,9,3262,5.071428571428571
8462766,5,B0059676CA,"Le Songe, or The Dream, based on Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, revolutionizes the realm of contemporary ballet. I was expecting something lacking costumes, sets, and emotion based on a thin plot with bland music. Le Songe proves just the opposite. Though the sets are minimalist, the costumes are beautiful and easy to recognize. In balletic form, Shakespeare's play can prove somewhat difficult to interpret, so all of the Athenians have their names written out on the costumes. For this work, the dancers are spectacular, perfectly mastering the language of the body demanded by Jean-Christophe Maillot, the choreographer.
The music is remarkable. Shifting between three composers (Felix Mendelssohn, Daniel Teruggi, and Bertrand Maillot), the viewer undergoes perfect orchestral scores, electronic screeches, and flat-out screaming and sound effects from the dancers. After watching, the ballet struck me as something very familiar: almost Cirque du Soleil-esque. However, the acrobatics are replaced with sinuous ballet, terrific acting, and a very enriching and emotionally complex story, something the circus can't achieve in this grandeur.
The DVD for this ballet is filmed in very high quality. Apart from the quality and ability to capture the entire piece in its fullest, there are several angles that enrich the ballet, and wouldn't be able to have been viewed by a live audience. These include the artisans behind their small set trying to change costumes and Lysander spitting on Hermia, among other shots. The accompanying booklet is also helpful in the direct deciphering of the story, with the 23 scenes and epilogue clearly written out.
Though this is far from the classical Petipa, or the neoclassical Balanchine, Maillot proves that ballet is not dead. He's taken an ancient story and spun it with modern effects and contemporary dance to create almost a new genre of ballet, a highly plot-based contemporary ballet. This DVD belongs in any ballet or dance fan's collection.",1318204800,11,2004,5.405750798722044
