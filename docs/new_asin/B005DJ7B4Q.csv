8466911,5,B005DJ7B4Q,"I love Antiques Roadshow, I was featured on the European version of it until a local person accused me of not ""upping the price enough"" on the appraisal of his antique.  Well, we got into a heated debate, exchanging words and his teapot broke.  I haven't been asked to return.",1403740800,,276,4.5
