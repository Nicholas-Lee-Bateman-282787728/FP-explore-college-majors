8088612,5,B000BKVR5Q,"ALvaro Carrillo was a native of Oaxaca Mexico who wrote amazing songs of love. He died with his wife and two of thier Children in a Car accident in 1969. This film is about his life and it begins with a tribute being made in his name on Radio, and Alvaro and his family hearing it as they are suddenly to suffer thier terrible end.

Jose Jose plays Alvaro beautifully and sings all of the songs that were set for the film, of which Jose Jose already recorded them previously and in beautiful settings of a more Pop but still Fairy Tale set atmosphere. Angelica Aragon playes his dear wife who is with ALvaro to the end, in which Angelica sings as well, but in serinades of love to her husband.

Alvaro attended one of the most legendary but strict academies in all Mexico, which was built out of a huge former fortress and convent; while Diego Rivera also designed the main Chappel of the School in designs of Nude portraits desplaying ""Mama Tierra"" or Mother Earth. This is shown in the film.

When he struggled as a singer, Alvaro sang in a Brothel with a friend of his who is played by Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo of Zero en Cunducta fame; and the Brothel Madame is played by Carmen Salinas in a memorable fashion. His performing in a Brothel got ALvaro in trouble with his wife and in laws, but in the end he is told to abandon the Brothel by Salinas's character or DIE!!!

In the end Alvaro wrote songs that were made legendary by Javier Solis and Marco Antonio Muniz as well as Pedro Vargas besides Jose Jose, with the film mentioning that Alvaro's songs were recorded in Japan and even by Frank Sinatra himself.

Alvaro dies in the accident as a truck swerves in front of thier 1964 Ford Falcon and causes the car to crash in a ditch and explode. When all in the Tribute find out that the Maestro died as they were Tributing him, Ortiz's character{ who is there} begs for applause instaide of moments of silence, and the film ends with the car burning and the cameras pointing to the sky in an ancient Mexican tradition of death and its passing as well as the spirit soring from its place of death, especially a funeral pyre. The song that ends the film is "" NO Te Vayas NO"" a beautiful love song and anthem of eternal love.

I adore this film and its soundtrack and wish for all to see it although it has no subtitles for those who do not understand Castillano.",1150675200,6,2363,4.346938775510204
