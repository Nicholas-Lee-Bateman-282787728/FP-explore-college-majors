I read the entire comicbook series when it first came out in Japan in the early 90's.

What is so hard for Funimation to just label the DVD's with numbers (AND KEEP THE DARN ORDER!!) so people don't buy duplicate DVDs or go insane trying to watch it in order?!?!?!

There's no such thing as darn sagas in the original version.

JUST NUMBER THE DARN DVDS!!!!",1161820800,,389,4.361111111111111
8111616,1,B000ENUKNK,"If you are looking to complete the Vegeta Saga 2 boxset, then do not buy this product. They stopped releasing these DVDs after Volume 9. So this Vegeta Saga 2 boxset will have one DVD included, and you can buy one more DVD and that's it. There will be about 3 more DVDs that will never be released to complete this set. So people who bought this starter boxset (like me) anticipating more to come got screwed.",1154563200,14,409,4.324675324675325
8111617,5,B000ENUKNK,"If you haven't got any Vegeta Saga DVD's then get them. If your only looking for ones with the most action, I recommend Ultimate Sacrafice.  Also I can't wait for The Saiyan Prince which I heard will be coming out this fall. Yeah, it's a long time but I've seen the feturette(i know i spelled it wrong) in vol. 1 and 3, and the fight between Goku and Vegeta is the best ever. I liked the fight even with all those edits funimation made. The uncut version is for the Goku vs Vegeta fight is like 5X better than any other fight in the  range of 250 episodes.

I liked DBZ ever since i turned the TV on and saw it on Cartoon Network about a decade ago. I had no idea though that it was the edited version i was seeing.

Anyway, about the DVD, I'll tell you about almost everything so if you don't want me to spoil it then read some other review. It starts off from when Chouzu blew himself up to save Tien. Tien throws one last Kikoho but it only chips part of Nappa's armor. Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillin are the only z fighters left. Right before Nappa was about to kill them, Vegeta stops him and says that they will wait 3 hours for Goku. Nappa goes around causing mayhem everywhere. This takes most of the 2nd episode, along with some clips of Goku rushing down snake way. Three hours later, Goku hasn't arrived yet, and the saiyan's decide to resume the fight. After a brief battle, Goku arrives at the Check in station in other world and Kami takes him back earth. Goku gets some senzu beans and eats one, calls nimbus and goes off to help. After more fighting with Nappa, Piccolo is the first to sense Goku coming. Of course since Nappa nor Vegeta can sense power levels, they don't believe them. Until Vegeta puts on his scouter. He tells Nappa that in about 4 min. someone with a power level of 5000 will arrive. Nappa at his full power only reaches 4000, so he gets scared. Vegeta says since the Earth fighters can change their power levels a lot. Goku had at least 5000. He commands Nappa to kill the Z fighters and show no mercy. He attacks Krillin and when he goes for Gohan instead gets kicked in the face by him. When Nappa gets up he throws a Bomer DX (i think that is what it's called) right at gohan. Every thing starts to move in slow mo. Nappa shooting at gohan, Piccolo rememembering moments with gohan, and piccolo running towards him. Suddenly, Kami says that it's time for him to die and piccolo leaps in front of Gohan and gets hit. He starts to scream and the DVD is over. That sucks you have to wait all summer so you can see Goku fight.",1151020800,4,2560,4.239754098360656
