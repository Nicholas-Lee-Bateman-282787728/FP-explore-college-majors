8016223,1,B0001SYKZM,"That it was a tape and not a Stability Bar! No way would I pay for a caveman tape. Shame on false advertising, Not once in any of my tracking did I see ""VHS"" Tape...until the package arrived. I would pay almost $40. for a Stability Bar, not for a tape!. Anyone, even my dogs know how to bounce on a mini-trampoline! Not anywhere did it make clear it was  a tape!",1297468800,,362,4.027777777777778
8016224,5,B0001SYKZM,"I am a senior with a situation that requires the use of a stability bar on a rebounder.  After trying several other DVDs (including Urban Rebounding for Seniors) and finding them inappropriate for me, I saw part of this routine on the internet and looked up Blanche Black's website.  She is a geriatric rehabilitation nurse and her experience and knowledge shows in her routines.  So I decided to buy it, and have been very pleased.

The program begins with approx 9 minutes stretching routine while seated in a chair

10 Minutes Rebounding Routine while holding onto the stability bar. Listed below are some of the steps:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Health bounce (feet do not leave mat)
Alternating left/right heel lifts
Twists from side to side (moving feet lightly, not vigorous jumping)
Bouncing while lifting alternating left/right leg forward, heel touching the mat
Bouncing while lifting alternating left/right leg to the side, foot touching the mat
Mild jogging, foot only slightly off mat
Step out to side, right then left; then back to center right then left
Step out to side, left then right; then back to center left then right
Bounce and kick, alternating left/right leg forward
Bounce and kick, alternating left/right leg to the side
Bounce and kick, alternating left/right leg to the back (knee bent)
Jogging, lifting knees high
Jogging, alternating between lifting feet approx an inch and several inches
Bouncing with both feet of the mat
----------------------------------------------------------------
The program finishes with several minutes of seated stretching.

Pros
--Excellent beginning routine
--Instructions are easy to follow
--Moves progressively from easy to more difficult
--Does not include steps inappropriate for someone at this level
--Variety of movements makes it more interesting and while affecting different muscle groups
--Music is easy to listen to and has a proper beat to synchronize with

Cons
--Price is too high
--Quality of DVD should be better, especially for the price
-No menu so you have to fast forward to the rebounding routine.  I already have a yoga routine of my own so I don't need to always follow along with her stretching routine.
--No arm movements are included.  The Urban Rebounder DVD for Seniors demonstrated exercising one arm at a time while holding on to the bar with the other.  This would be a welcome addition.

I have Blanche Black's other DVD, Bouncin' in the House, which is also excellent, but too difficult for someone in my situation.  However, I do sometimes use the steps from the stability bar routine to follow along with Bouncin' in the House for a longer routine and for more variety.  It would be nice if both were combined into one DVD.

Rebounding had opened up a new level of fitness I didn't really think was possible for me.  I immediately found my core muscles getting stronger.  Even my arm muscles were sore from minimal arm movements, so I believe it when they say it exercises your whole body.

For those who find this too easy, well, good for you.  However, I was discouraged after viewing other ""beginner"" rebounding routines because they progressed way too fast into movements that were not appropriate or safe for my situation, and lacked insight into the needs that real people face with various physical challenges.  So I would like to say a very big thank you to Blanche Black for providing this much needed routine.  Please consider making more routines of this type for people who really need the full-body benefits of rebounding.",1270252800,4,3570,5.132987910189983
