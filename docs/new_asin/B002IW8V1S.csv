3937574,5,B002IW8V1S,Mike Epps' stand up is HILARIOUS. this album is a must have for all comedy fans!,1258416000,2,80,4.0625
3937575,1,B002IW8V1S,"I just watched the beginning, and then I had to stop and do some research.  The beginning of this show tells us that Mike Epps did this show in Detroit during the ""heart"" (whatever that is) of the depression.  He pointed out that Detroit was the most hit by the economy's downfall, and he pointed out that he sold out two shows of 10,000 people each.

I guess his point is that even during a depression, people will pay money to see him.

The message I got was, ""I'm going to point out the depression at the beginning to make myself sound like a good person.""

The jerk didn't give a PENNY back to Detroit.  Don't give him any more money for this opportunistic ego-tripping jerk.

I *did* sit through the entire show.  His jokes are in the same vein as countless other comedians--nothing original.  Frequently, one item (such as the offensive ""heartstrings"" attempt at the beginning) can make or break a movie or special.  For example, where would ""Psycho"" be without the shower scene?",1257552000,2,985,4.577142857142857

3937601,1,B002IW8V1S,DVD came packaged perfectly but when I put it in the player there was no content. The DVD had nothing on it. Since I live overseas it was too late to send it back. I am very disappointed at this manufacturer of this product.,1388275200,,224,4.113636363636363

3937608,5,B002IW8V1S,"This Man had my stomach Hurtin! This type of comedy may not be for everyone but I will say this, you will watch this movie again, and again! My favorite bit was about the Handicapped Singer, ""Baaabyyy,you know I Love you"", when he ask the crowd will he go to hell for this and they said,Yeah.respoinding back with ""Ya'll laugh too"" , totally hilarious! So for those who will think that  was rude,I just have to say.""Leave Me Alone and Git Out Of Ma Face""!",1348876800,,455,4.352941176470588

3937611,4,B002IW8V1S,"if i want to lol i pop in this DVD. Its cool for all. My favorite part is where he says music has changed. and he wanted to fill in Detroit the home of Motown, ""so how did we go from 'if i ever lose your love' to 'i was gettn some head, i was gettn some head'?!""

he doesnt do racist jokes, if anything he clowns around with the people in the crowd superbly.

and let me not forget. the artist who opens for him is non other than Doug E Fresh!!!!!!!!

3937616,5,B002IW8V1S,"Mike Epps is crazy as ever, but I laughed so hard watching this video. This is the type of video you have to watch on an empty stomach because you're going to laugh hard and you might throw up! LOL Great video!",1269129600,,210,4.023809523809524
3937617,5,B002IW8V1S,"I didn't care for Mike Epps doing stand-up after seeing several of his performances. He's excellent in movies, but not too good doing stand-up. However, this DVD is not only his best performance, but it's one of the funniest of the past 10 years. This ranks among the best! Mike put in serious work. I've watched it plenty of times over and over again, and I actually laugh out loud each time. If he keeps this up then he will go down as one of the best. He's clearly on the radar after this masterpiece.

The only drawback is that it's not a full 90 minutes like Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, and Chris Rock's stand-ups.",1265932800,,637,4.444444444444445
3937618,5,B002IW8V1S,I purchase this comedic movie last month and surely I wasn't disappointed it sure lived up to its product details I surely was entertained. Mike Epps is a must buy for any fan that wants to see him in action and telling Day-Day jokes,1262995200,,233,4.318181818181818

3937620,5,B002IW8V1S,"I like Mike Epps and have seen him in person many times, and this is a solid comedy dvd. I think it could have gone longer but it has extras so I guess. The comedy is his funniest so far. Im going to watch it tonight matter of fact.",1260057600,2,232,3.7551020408163267
3937621,5,B002IW8V1S,"My dvd arrived and I haven't laughed this hard in sooo long, which I've really needed. The clips were just a small tease and I knew I wanted more. Sometimes his material can be hit or miss and your not always sure what your going to get with him. Thankfully, it is a hit with this dvd that I am pleasantly surprised about.",1259798400,2,322,4.126984126984127

3937624,5,B002IW8V1S,Mike Epps is a comedian you can watch over and over again.  This video also introduced Doug E Fresh at the beginning of the show which was great because he is an old school hip star who I love.  If you like good comedy this is the one one for you.,1259539200,5,247,3.823529411764706
3937625,5,B002IW8V1S,Mike Epps is one of my favorite comedians right now. I can honestly say that there is never a dull moment on this dvd. All of his jokes are hysterical. My favorites were the ones about Obama. This is definitely the perfect christmas present to get for any of the comedy fans in your family/group of friends!,1259539200,3,307,4.4035087719298245
