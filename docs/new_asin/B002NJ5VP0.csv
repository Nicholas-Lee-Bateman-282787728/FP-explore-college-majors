8583274,4,B002NJ5VP0,"This video from Cleverlearn contains several dramatized scenarios of reasonalby representative business situations. The production is well done and actors and actresses portray the situations realistically without overacting. I was surprised that the DVD had no specific references to the grammar. It is up to the learner or the teacher to connect the grammatical dots. Overall, the DVD serves as a good learning tool at a very reasonalbe price.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cleverlearn-ESL-Video-Series-Learn-Business-English-Through-Dramatized-Situations-Ep-1-of-3/dp/B002NJ5VP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cleverlearn ESL Video Series: Learn Business English Through Dramatized Situations Ep 1 of 3</a>",1267315200,3,750,7.8352941176470585
