8719293,5,B00YWCEFVW,"Okay, I'm biased. I know Sherri.

But no way would I publicly go on about how great this is if it weren't great. The very idea that a group of friends could come together and make something this good - Saturday Night Live-level good - and about something PROFOUND, no less...? Wow.

Some people make things - they make art - because they simply can't NOT make things. Sherri is one of those people. Money or attention isn't the point. She just makes great things.",1458864000,19,463,4.435294117647059
