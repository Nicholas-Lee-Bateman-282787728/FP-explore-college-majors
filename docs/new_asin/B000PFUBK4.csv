8191036,5,B000PFUBK4,"Great video, very informative, eye opening to some who thought they're eyes were open. Sometimes we need to hear what we already know but put together in a way that provokes thought and a higher level of understanding.",1459123200,,218,4.7631578947368425
8191037,5,B000PFUBK4,"Excellent revelation of the dark side of Globalization, the World Bank, the IMF, U.S. Corporations and how they have crippled other countries !",1437609600,,143,5.260869565217392
8191038,5,B000PFUBK4,"Thank you John for exposing the large Corporations agendas and the governments participation in subjugating the world to them. He had a heartless job, and he came around to  his heart again. Now he carries that weight with good consciousness.",1389398400,,242,5.05
8191039,5,B000PFUBK4,"A good summary of the main points in the famous book ""A Confession of an Economic Hitman"". Highly recommended viewing.",1388707200,,118,4.95
8191040,5,B000PFUBK4,The rich countries and private companies are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. The system that the rich have devised wants free labor.  The big corporations indirectly control the international financial system. The Bolivian water system fiasco is a prime example of how the system has failed.,1369267200,,307,5.26530612244898
8191041,5,B000PFUBK4,"Perkins details  names of government leaders, corporations, and countries. He describes how international companies, through consultants, lie to foreign governments about the benefits of going into heavy debt to finance infrastructure projects.  These projects are carried out by corporations like Bechtel and Halliburton.  The projects do not benefit most of the people of a country; they benefit the international companies and the elite within that country.  When the country cannot pay back its debts (which was the original plan), concessions are extracted that include privatization of natural resources in ways that rip off the country. In addition, the debt falls on the citizens of the country who did not benefit from the debt-financed projects.  It's a big win for the multinational corporations and a huge loss for ordinary citizens.

Perkins also describes three techniques used to extort concessions from government leaders. They are offered large bribes if they comply with corporate plans and subtly threatened with either removal from office or assassination if they refuse to ""cooperate."" Perkins names various government leaders who have fallen victim to these techniques.

Perkins has done a great service in exposing corruption by large corporations against humanity.",1361577600,,1288,5.642487046632124
8191042,5,B000PFUBK4,"John Perkins tells a fascinating and devastating tale of how the world we live in really works. As an individual who worked in ""the trenches"" on the front lines of the economic exploitation of other nations to the benefit of transnational banks and corporations, Mr. Perkins is in a highly unique position to tell it like it is. For anyone wishing to understand foreign policy where the rubber meets the road, this is an unvarnished portrayal of how the game is played, and what is being done around the world in the names of each and every American citizen. It is not a pretty story, but it is an important story. If we are to have any hope of reversing the present course of history, and truly work towards a more peaceful and equitable world for all, then this documentary is a must have for the library of individuals serious about contributing to the cause of that better world. One will not read about such matters in the mainstream media, so breaking out of the paradigm of corporate controlled media sources and pursuing independent study of such insightful works is the best path to becoming better informed and, hopefully, better citizens due to a new understanding.",1357084800,,1176,4.713592233009709
8191043,2,B000PFUBK4,"For someone who is not familiar with, for example, Susan George's work, this was an interesting general introduction into how multinational corporations in combination with governments exploit poor countries around the globe. However, I found it overall vague and would have liked more facts.

The last part of the interview, in which he talks about how our planet could become a better world for everyone, was annoying because he didn't present any ideas as to how this could be accomplished. The world might indeed be a better place if the ""corporocracy"" could be eliminated or at least reigned in, but that's much easier said than done - and what are we to do in the meantime?

All in all, at least in my opinion, not much (factual) substance here.",1308700800,2,751,4.813953488372093
8191044,5,B000PFUBK4,"This short presentation is a good introduction to Mr. Perkins excellent books.  For a superb, engrossing similar view on DVD, try ""Life and Debt"", which is about how globalization destroyed the people and businesses of Jamaica.  It feels good to know about the rotten things that our country has done.",1233964800,11,301,5.0
