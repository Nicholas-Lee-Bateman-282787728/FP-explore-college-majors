8136363,3,B000H5TUZY,"Once in a while i'll take a gamble and purchase something without any details and sometimes it pays off and sometimes you get something so bad you think you belong in the mental ward! since i just recently purchased this dvd i felt to give a review so others can make a decision whether to purchase or not.first off the reason for taking off two stars is the cover,it looks like a map of some asian country or india on the discription but in real life it's a white cover with casper the friendly ghost,little lulu,and some random wolf guy who i imagine is the the big bad wolf! right there should be a sign,no woody wood pecker,no betty boop,and not even popeye,and some random wolf guy,like he was so popular he deserves this triple head booking! for some reason i thought this dvd would consist of foriegn cartoons due to the cover but instead you get 20 cartoons that can be found on many other cartoon compilations.the cartoons are listed as digitally mastered and compared to other cartoon compilations the quality is pretty good,i would say it's a 7 out of a ten,but the second cartoons music is loud but the audio is real low.the other reason for the average review is the cartoons themselves,theres only casper,little lulu,and nursery classics that's it,not much of variety,so you might be better off buying a different compilation,but to give this set a postive the price is cheap,i wouldn't spend more than three dollars on this though.if this was a dollar dvd then 5 stars!!heres a complete list of episodes!
1.casper- a haunting we will go. 2.casper-spooking about africa(low audio)3.casper-boo moon. 4.casper-the friendly ghost,5.casper-there's good boos tonight,6.little lulu-a bout with a trout,7.little lulu-a scout with a gout,8.little lulu-bargain counter attack,9.little lulu-bored of education,10.little lulu-chick and double chick,11.little lulu-loose in the caboose,12.little lulu musical lulu-cad and caddy,13.nursery classics-humpty dumpty,14.nursery classics mary's little lamb,15.nursery classics-old macdonald had a  farm. 16.nursery classics-old mother hubbard. 17.nursery classics-hansel and gretel,18.nursery classics-the BIG BAD WOLF(THE MAIN STAR),19.nursery classics-the three bears,and finally 20.nursery classics-red riding hood!

they also note all cartoons in color except #20 is black and white!
sorry for the long review but i hope it helps someone out and that they change the picture of the dvd to the right product!",1364688000,2,2457,5.395833333333333
