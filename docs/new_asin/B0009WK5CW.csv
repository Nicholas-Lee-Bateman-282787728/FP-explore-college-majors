2328296,5,B0009WK5CW,Seen the movie but this book is easier to follow the action.  There is a lot going on in the background.  Excellent read!,1523750400,,121,4.217391304347826

2328302,5,B0009WK5CW,"Yes, I saw the movies. This is different, but the movie did capture the feel of it; confusion, bits of knowledge, a puzzle in the dark.... I think I prefer the book, even though I loved the movies.  But I confess to being jumpy, checking dark corners after reading!",1521417600,,265,4.408163265306122

2328308,5,B0009WK5CW,"Terrific so far. However, and maybe it's just me, but there seem to be pages missing in the first chapter of the ebook. Around pp. 8-9, there appears to be a narrative leap. When the doctor first starts talking to Bourne, he asks him his name. Bourne says he doesn't know. Then there's a gap, because the next lines of dialog pick up with the doctor telling Bourne not to crucify himself and that it's going to take time, etc. I don't know if the folks at Amazon will see this review, but I am truly perplexed.",1519257600,,510,4.268041237113402
2328309,5,B0009WK5CW,"The best f the Bourne Trilogy, the original but a bit dated due to the main protagonist being Carlos the Jackal, who by todays standards looks like a 2 bit punk in a dime store novel, but the writing is magnificent...Ludlum at his best, which if you are a reader of his work you know that is saying something!",1519084800,,309,4.254237288135593

2328328,4,B0009WK5CW,This book was written during the Cold War... so nothing like the Matt Damon movies. Ludlum writes great detail engulfing you imagination into the characters in the book.,1516752000,,169,5.071428571428571
2328329,5,B0009WK5CW,Awesome movie!!,1516752000,,15,7.0
2328330,3,B0009WK5CW,(3.50 stars) Matt Damon plays a government agent who suffers from amnesia and can't remember who he is.  Pretty good but the plot is also unclear except in a general sense.  One action sequence near the end when he takes quite a plunge several flights down seemed pushing believability a bit too far.,1516492800,,300,4.6415094339622645
2328331,4,B0009WK5CW,My husband forced me to watch this (including the rest of the movies in the Bourne series). I liked it. Now I know why my mother had a thing for Matt Damon.,1516320000,,156,3.90625

2328346,1,B0009WK5CW,"This is the first novel by Robert Ludlum that I ever attempted to read.  I like spy thrillers, but THE BOURNE IDENTITY was NOT a thriller.  It was slow and boring.  I kept hoping THE BOURNE IDENTITY would get interesting, but it never did.  After reading more than half the novel, I waved the white flag of surrender and gave up. THE BOURNE IDENTITY was like reading a dictionary or an organic chemistry textbook.  I was reading words that never told me a story or captured my imagination.",1513987200,,489,4.511363636363637

2328349,5,B0009WK5CW,Have been a big fan of the movies. Most books are usually better than the movie IMO so I gave this a shot. WOW! Amazing and now I kind of think Hollywood screwed up a great story. Hard to put this down.,1513296000,,202,3.8333333333333335

2328363,3,B0009WK5CW,"This is a funny one. I loved the movie, I appreciate the storyline in the book, but something about the authors style rubs me the wrong way, and makes reading the book an unpleasant experience.",1512950400,,193,4.542857142857143
2328364,4,B0009WK5CW,"This sounds like the more  credible modern book The Augustaccio Murders I previewed for a local author. I has a lot of detail that drags the story down. The relationship between Marie and Bourne is good but the dialog and motivation lacking in credibility. Ludlum is famous, rich and popular so it must be good but the spook detail is a little much.",1512777600,,349,4.5396825396825395
2328365,2,B0009WK5CW,"My review refers specifically to the audio version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity/dp/B001NJ5XHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity</a>, which I found difficult to enjoy. I loved the movie, and I was excited to listen to the book during my long commute. Unfortunately, the narrator's performance is intolerable. I started listening to this book immediately after listening to Paul Michael's master performance in Dan Brown's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Origin-A-Novel/dp/B01LXP64UB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Origin: A Novel</a>. By comparison, Scott Brick sounds like a middle school thespian wannabe trying too hard in the school's fall theater production. His character accents are inconsistent, sloppy, and often indistinguishable, which makes it difficult to follow along with Ludlum's writing style. His pacing rarely varies and his vocal variety is repetitive to the point that everything sounds the same. Seriously, it's maddening. Brick's reading style is so distracting that it is difficult to immerse yourself into Ludlum's world. Skip the audio edition and either read the book or see the movie. You'll be much happier and you'll save yourself more than 22 hours of frustration.",1512691200,,1315,6.78698224852071

2328367,5,B0009WK5CW,Love the book. It filled in many details that the movie either glossed over or ignored all together. Highly recommended,1512086400,,119,5.0
2328368,5,B0009WK5CW,"I'm not much the person into action movies, but this one will keep you on the edge of your seat - wanting to know how Jason Bourne gets out of his tricky situation of having failed his mission. I have not read the book, I think it shows the value of innocence, and definitely makes you think about the beauty of a life of simplicity. The most happy moments in life are spent with family and the ones you love. Not too much blood - although a lot of violence. Matt Damon is a very good actor! His facial expressions were on point during suspenseful moments, and I loved how oblivious he was during the romantic scenes with Mari. All in all - a great watch.",1511481600,,655,4.2063492063492065
2328369,3,B0009WK5CW,The movie with Matt Damon is far superior to the book.  A great screenwriter took the book and made it a classic.,1511136000,,113,4.136363636363637

2328383,3,B0009WK5CW,The repetition ad nauseam of the same mantra throughout the book spoiled it for me. Ludlum has written much better books than this far-fetched nonsense.,1509753600,,152,5.12

It got me started reading more and I was excited when they announced they were making it into a movie.  I was disappointed that they did not follow the book, it would have made a better movie.",1507766400,,293,4.105263157894737
2328390,1,B0009WK5CW,"The story is good, but has been done many times over. My biggest complaint is the casting.
Matt Damon as the lead role? OMG he is millions light years from a tough guy.
Have you seen Good Will Hunting? The Martian now?
Matt Damon is a geek, a mild mannered nice guy. He is definitely *not* a BAD ASS like Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone or Van Diesel.
He is very middle class dull guy which makes his Jason Bourne character not believable.",1507680000,,440,4.378048780487805

2328405,5,B0009WK5CW,"I first read the Bourne trilogy by Robert Ludlum about 20 years ago . In the intervening time I experienced a large amount of vision loss . I purchased this book along with audible version and really enjoyed listening to it . It has an extremely intricate plot it's a completely amazing book . As a longtime fan of Cold War fiction , I don't think it gets better than Robert Ludlum and I think the Bourne trilogy is some of his finest work . I'm looking forward to listening to the other two books now .",1506902400,,503,4.195876288659794

2328408,2,B0009WK5CW,"The plot of the movie was way, way better.  For that matter everything was better about the movie.  This book is really, really slow.  The first 75% is just blah, blah, blah.  Im amazed that the book was chosen for a movie, but fortunately the screen writer was a much better author than Ludlum.  And then his love interest:  Lets see he threatens to kill her multiple times, physically abuses her and when he saves her life she falls in love with him???  And Carlos the Jackal is jealous of Bourne because??  Really?  I would give it one star, but I usually quit reading one star books.

I also noticed that a lot of the positive reviews for the book are really for the movie.",1506384000,,677,4.344

2328424,5,B0009WK5CW,excellent,1504051200,,9,9.0
2328425,3,B0009WK5CW,"Yeah, the book was kind of disjointed, but I took that as a literary necessity to reflect the struggles of a man trying to recover a lost identity. The book is a series of improbabilities piled on top of each other as a single man is able to outwit the intrigues of underworld and government forces who are trying their best to take him down. Okay, the willing suspension of disbelief will get you past all this, but the sticking point for me was his woman--a victim turned into a willing confidant, an economics expert from Canada who willingly sacrificed her own history and career to support his struggle to identify his true self. I found the movie's selection of a vagabond sidekick to be much more plausible--a German woman, an amateur at everything, a likable enough person with no professional or personal life keeping her from merging her life with his. The routine killing was a routine event in the book, more so than in the movie, which seems at first blush to be a bit farfetched, but at second thought uncomfortably close to the daily reality we seem to be drifting towards. For me, the movie was a better experience than the book, but the book might be a good follow-up for those of you that really liked the movie and want to see what inspired it. So yeah, go ahead and read the book if you've got nothing better to do with your time.",1503878400,,1350,4.469635627530365

2328449,4,B0009WK5CW,"The book has similar aspects of the film but the bulk of the story is different. The time is set in the 1970s so the issues are different. The book has more intrigue than action but there is still a lot of suspense over who Bourne is and why people want to kill him.  Marie is a completely different character. She is educated, introspective, and strong. I enjoyed the story and will read the series.

The plot is fairly predictable: there's Jason Bourne, he's on the run, he's lost his memory, and he's great and beating up bad guys. Cut to tense scenes of information rooms, guys in suits who look like they haven't slept in days, drinking coffee and yelling about ""the project is out of control"" and various silly things that really don't matter. You know all along they won't catch him - best they'll do is deploy a couple deadly assassins who will get close to him but will ultimately get killed, so what's the point? Watch Bourne on the run trying figure out whatever he's trying to figure out, all while openly walking around in public looking just like his mugshot and no one seeming to notice (why does he never wear hats/glasses/fake beard, etc?)

2328816,2,B0009WK5CW,"So it begins. We all knew this was going to happen. Studios barely care about giving catalogue releases new film masters from the negative, so do people really believe they are just going to magically transform every title in 4K and spend the money on 4K transfers?

Haha, no. This film looks different from the bluray for sure, but it's probably worse. The transfer they used for this 4K edition, costing 20 or 30 dollars, is the same 1080p transfer you got on bluray. There might be a very small, barely noticeable uptick in detail, but it's nothing hardly anyone will actually notice.

What is different is the reduction in color. HDR and the contrast have manipulated the image to be lifeless almost, and very much different from the bluray. I will leave the viewer to see the film and choose which they prefer, but for all intents and purposes I actually like the bluray better. At any rate the release is being sourced from not even a 2K Digital Intermediate. What is the point of this release? Much like many old and shoddy blurays, the point is to take your money.

So who is this 4K release for? IDK. It's clearly not even in the same galaxy as something like The Revenant, which is amazing in 4K. This release at times looks worse than the bluray. So for 20 bucks you are getting basically the same thing you get for 4 dollars on sale. If it is worth it to you to have both masters in one release so be it. I know collectors will probably want both.

But be warned: this is going to happen more and more. It happened to bluray from dvd in a LOT of releases, and doing 4K masters from the original negative is an expensive process that will not be used on the vast majority of films. To be honest this release is basically a cash grab. And there will be many more like it. And for a cherry on top the cover art is awful. It does have slightly better audio for those that care.",1482278400,,1885,4.331444759206799

  Love the books, love the film franchise.. But they are different from one another.",1482105600,,481,4.523255813953488

2328823,4,B0009WK5CW,"I read this in high school 20 years ago and loved it. The movie adaptation was decent, but I enjoy the original story much more.

Plenty of intrigue, oodles of well-written action. Even though it's dated (phone booths?!?) it's still a great read.",1481760000,,246,4.72093023255814
2328824,3,B0009WK5CW,Great story line but Ludlum has Bourne all over the place and I tended to get lost.  I'll follow Bourne at the movies.,1481760000,,118,4.130434782608695
2328835,1,B0009WK5CW,Great movie but the 4K transfer is terrible.  No wonder the price is so cheap on this movie.  It's honestly like a DVD upscale to blu ray quality.  Very disappointed as this was my first purchased 4K Blu Ray.,1481673600,,208,4.282051282051282
2328836,5,B0009WK5CW,"Great fun, well acted.  As a reader of the novels many years ago, I've forgotten all the details and enjoy this admittedly cinematicized rendition of the story.  It is beautifully shot in beautiful places with beautiful actors.",1481500800,,227,5.108108108108108
2328837,5,B0009WK5CW,"This is one of my favorite movies. This and the 5th movie (Jason Bourne 2016) are mastered in 4k while the Bourne Supremacy, Ultimatum and Legacy are mastered in 2k and upscaled to 4k. This does not mean they are bad quality - the new 4k format means way more colors (use of the yellow part of the pixel), making the film look more realistic, and studio grade equipment means way better upscaling than your average console, BD player or TV can do. Also, you get a higher bitrate in the audio because of the new formats.",1481068800,,519,4.360824742268041

Couple these with a brilliant performance by Damon and you KNOW you'll have to watch all of the Bourne movies if you like the first one, preferably over a weekend with friends or perhaps solo on a late-night movie binge!  The level of language is pretty subdued since it's a PG-13 movie; there is plenty of violence but no gratuitous ""gore"", primarily fight scenes. A long-winded review is not needed.

The plot is original and the writing in some of the chapters is excellent, but...this is a wholly predictable book, with unbelievable characters who perform unrealistic deeds. They have encyclopedic knowledge of every person and of every event mentioned, which at times is plain ridiculous. The love angle is also mishandled: nothing gives you an excuse for the sudden burning passion that erupts between the two main characters.

The worst thing, however, is the continuous ""telling"". Everybody knows that good writing requires ""showing"", instead of ""telling"", so the author thinks he can trick us by doing all his telling through artificial conversations between third parties; not only is that boring, but the discerning reader is outraged that the author should think him so gullible that he would not see through this stratagem.

It was annoying to hear him exclaim endlessly how horrifying it was to think that he must have been a feared assassin. Also, the headaches that he kept getting, the pounding, the pain, the agony, blah, blah, blah. Some good scenes, a few interesting characters, but basically the book was unsatisfying, especially when I compared it to the movie.

2329594,1,B0009WK5CW,Movie is great.  But somehow it kept stopping and reverting back to the same point in the movie.  I never was able to finish it.  I don't know if the problem was with Amazon or with my cable company (for internet service).  I've never had the problem before.  And it's especially irritating when Amazon Prime doesn't cover an old movie like this so you pay for it and can't even watch it.,1470528000,,388,4.333333333333333

In the beginning, it moved with lightning speed, then it slowed to a crawl, more and more thereafter, this and then that new characters and situations, were introduced.  Literally, it went on and on, revisiting the same scenes over and over, but with new characters.  It went into the prime characters psychological ruminations again and again, more often that not using the exact same words.  How could this boring, cumbersome, never ending pile of excrement, ever be considered a best seller?  More astonishing, how could Hollywood ever believe this story worthy of being transferred to screen?  And finally, and most amazing -- how could the screen writers formulate a script from that mess, that was as compelling as was this motion picture?  Im altogether flabbergasted.  But Im grateful too, because their cut and paste was absolutely, positively first rate.  The Motion picture, The Bourne Identity, was a terrific film.",1470268800,,984,5.018518518518518

2329598,5,B0009WK5CW,"First off, I believe this should be a review of the book...not the movie.  I have read the Bourne series many times over.  The Bourne Identity is THE book that brought me into reading.  The character of JB is highly complex, makes me want to continue trying to find out more from him.  I believe the genius of Mr. Ludlum was bringing into play the assassin Carlos.  Someone my age recognized, could wrap my imagination around.  Yes people, Carlos is a real live terrorist...known for many European acts of terror....the Libyan plane hijack, possible mastermind of the Munich Olympic disaster.  This book has everything one wants in an espionage/spy thriller.  Locales, characters, plot twists, suspense.  Hands down...best book I ever read(not counting LOTR).  The Bourne series is one I continue to read every couple of years.  I am not a fan of the new ones by Lustbader.",1470096000,,873,4.870748299319728

2329627,2,B0009WK5CW,"I love the Bourne movies, so decided I would read the first book and then continue to the rest. Now I'm not sure I want to waste my time and money.
Well,number one was very confusing.  I don't know if the plot was deliberately confusing because of his amnesia, or was the author just trying to put us in the mindset/nightmare of the character.  There was a little too much angst, which I found tedious and kept wanting it to get the point a little faster. There was definitely something missing.  I felt absolutely no connection to any of the characters, it was as though we are seeing everything through some kind of dark veil.  I posted this a full of surprises because there should have been another choice:  Confusing. It just didn't make sense. i was very disappointed.  There were too many points of view, and there were too many characters to keep up with in determining his fate. In the end, we still don't know who Bourne is or isn't.

The overall success of this 1.2 billion dollar franchise spanning 10 years cemented Matt Damon as an A list actor, and might just be responsible for the rebooting of the James Bond series starring Daniel Craig. The Bourne Identity set the pace for what follows, with it's stellar acting, crisp plot and fresh directing by Doug Liman.

The whole movie, based on the premise that he doesn't remember who he is, is fine.

But the fact that when fisherman saved him from the water, and didn't call the coast guard, and that Jason Bourne spent two weeks working as a fisherman with them, was unrealistic and stupid.  It ruined the integrity of the rest of the film.  When someone loses their memory, they go to the authorities for help, or someone else calls on their behalf.",1466380800,,531,4.28

Maybe it's just reading about it versus seeing him disarm a guy with a rolled up magazine that makes the book less thrilling.

2329957,4,B0009WK5CW,"Matt Damon makes Jason Bourne more than some run-of-the-mill action meathead like Jai Courtney, he is extraordinary in his combat and driving skills but has a human angle. He gets stressed, depressed, and feels exactly what anyone else would in his situation of being hunted down and not knowing why. Despite the PG-13 rating, the combat feels intense and doesn't go overboard on shaky cam or cuts. It would've been nicer if they had made this choreographed so there would be less cuts in between every strike like in The Matrix or 70s martial arts movies, but this is a fair aesthetic choice that doesn't distract the viewer too much. Overall, this is a great movie and a must see for action junkies. This is also a great movie to show off your home theater setup with, with the excellent and booming sound design and crisp picture. Also for those who like special features, this is packed full of great ones that will take a fair amount of time to go through.",1461456000,,961,4.593023255813954

2330046,5,B0009WK5CW,"Realism is a key aesthetic in this novel and Ludlum depicts and tells it so well. Doing so makes it seem like he brought these characters to life with effortless finesse. Ultimately though, the realism is so keen that reading through Jason's life and experiencing his world one moment at a time was honestly tiresome. Though the adventure was drawn out in diligent detail, and so felt boring at times, it was still constructed with an enthused heart and impressive mind, and so felt pleasing to wade through. The journey itself was dope, badass, and just genuinely interesting. Jason Bourne is my favorite fictional character because of how Ludlum composed him from such an enigmatic writing style, if you will; Ludlum's writing is so appropriate to the nature of Bourne and the story itself. Everything was done right and accordingly. I have to say I like the films' plots and versions of Bourne better, but the original here is still an amazing man to get to know.",1457136000,,966,4.790419161676646

The book is in no way a source for the movie. It's completely different, and I'm sad to say, not as good. There are too many characters, and too much plot to keep up with. The first book inside the novel is very, very good, as we meet Jason Bourne and he is chased by killers, as he meets Marie.

2330238,5,B0009WK5CW,"I chose The Bourne Identity, by Robert Ludlum, for my English project because I was told that the movie was very good and I always try to read the book before I watch the movie.

The beginning of the book is extremely thrilling. It mentions how a man with an unknown past is pulled from the Mediterranean Sea by innocent fishermen. His body had suffered greatly from the impact of many bullets. The unknown man is taken to a doctor on a nearby island, who helps him recover. The doctor then finds evidence of plastic surgery and a micro-chip that sets him on his way to find a bank account with a large amount of money in Zurich, Switzerland.

For me, the most exciting part of the book is the section where the man discovers his true identity through clues hidden in a hotel. Once he finds out that he had checked in to the hotel recently, before he lost his memory, he manages to get the receptionist to sign his name on the check-in list. He reads the name to himself: Jason Bourne. A little farther into the story, he goes to the bank that the micro-chip is from, where he finds a large amount of money. He then realizes that he is more important then he thought; he becomes aware of assassins that have been following him and has to get out of Zurich to find out more about himself.

I recommend this book because it is the next step of action and mystery novels. When i was younger I enjoyed the CHERUB series by Robert Muchamore and i feel like this is a higher level for readers that enjoy this type of novel.

In conclusion, the book is a great read with plenty of action from cover to cover.",1446076800,,1601,4.291390728476821

2330337,4,B0009WK5CW,"Just read the book again and watched the movie for comparison. (had read/watched them a few times over the years.) No comparison, actually. the movie is an abbreviated, dumbed-down adaptation that misses out on SO many great aspects. For starters, the book has a great premise with several layers. The movie simplified it and took out all of the cool stuff like who Bourne actually is and, maybe, Carlos perhaps? The female character in the movie (Marie) is a random girl met at the embassy who is the politely asked for a ride to Paris. Really? Misses out on all the character development of the book, their hostage-based meeting/escape scenario, some cool scenes getting from Marseilles to Paris, etc. And the movie Marie is basically annoying and not smart/helpful as in the book. Carlos' network is also missing in the movie, because there's no Carlos. Lame. And the book has far more action than the movie. The characterizations, backgrounds and motivations in the book are FAR more interesting than the superficial movie treatment, which basically borrows the element of an 'assassin' with amnesia associated with a covert operation and little else. Even that aspect was simplified to the point of ruining it--in the movie, Bourne is just a secret assassin. Weak sauce.

If you've only seen the movie(s), I HIGHLY recommend reading the Bourne book(s). it'll be a whole new, and more rewarding, experience.",1440288000,,1411,5.02991452991453

2330506,4,B0009WK5CW,"This was the novel that made me a Robert Ludlum in the first place, way back in 1987 at the tender age of 12.  Mind you, I only read 1/3 of the book back then, though I read ""The Bourne Supremacy"" cover-to-cover a year later, go figure.  Anyways, nice to finally get fully caught up on the book after all these years, as I'm able to appreciate it now more than ever, with the benefit of military experience and world travel under my belt.  Great action, mysterious plotline that keeps you guessing and turning pages, and wonderful character development.  Now to re-read ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and read ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" for the first time.

Just a few firearms-related technical nitpicks that prevent me from rating this book a full 5 stars:
--p. 341: Argh, yet another author who thinks ""revolvers"" have safety catches and can be easily silenced with just a barrel suppressor....probably just using ""revolver"" as a generic synonym for a handgun even though it's most likely an autopistol. RIP Mr. Ludlum, but c'mon man!
--p. 507: A .357 Magnum automatic,"" eh? Well, lessee, at the time the book was published (1980) the only .357 Mag autopistol in existence (Desert Eagle and LAR Grizzly were bth still three years away from being invented), and moreover the Coonan was never hugely popular, and thus an unlikely choice for an undercover operative, especially in a country like France where American revolver caliber ammo would be quite rare
--p. 585: ""In his hands was a deadly automatic field machine gun with a rod and brace for a stock.""  Um, by ""rod and brace,"" did the author mean a collapsible metallic folding stock?

Other observations:
--p. 326: General MacKenzie Hawkins!?!? The same Mac Hawkins from ""The Road to Gnadolfo"" and ""The Road to Omaha??""
--I wonder if this Congressman Walters character was at least partially based upon the real-life Congressman Charlie Wilson.
--In retrospect, I'd say the 1988 ABC-TV mini-series starring Richard Chamberlain as the title character was more faithful to the novel than the 2002 theatrical film with Matt Damon.",1427068800,,2074,4.942528735632184

2330599,4,B0009WK5CW,"Why does this work, while exploitive stuff like ""Taken"" doesn't? In film, as in literature, it is with violence as it is with sex: context is all. The context in ""Taken"" was a kidnapped nubile daughter headed for white slavery, which occasioned in her dad a torrent of indiscriminate vigilantism. If ever a movie said, ""Americans, take the law into your own hands"" (or played on our desire to do that), then ""Taken"" was that movie. ""The Bourne Identity"" has a high body-count too, but the context makes all the difference. A CIA assassin (Matt Damon), having failed in a mission, is wounded and loses his memory and has to discover, if he can, who he is. Vital information sewn subcutaneously in a little cylinder gives him a start, and then he's off, first in Marseilles, then in Switzerland, then in Paris, and then . . . His handlers back at CIA HQ are distressed both by his failure and by his seeming to have ""gone rogue"" -- they know nothing of the memory loss, of course -- and since his operation was under-the-radar and highly sensitive, they believe he needs to be taken out. They call up (it seems) all their big-name European hit men, and the chase is on. I don't think I'll go further with the plot, although it's of a predictable kind.

Damon is fine as Jason Bourne, and he's appalled to learn that he is in effect a very expensive killing machine. We learn late why the original mission failed, and that might be counted to his credit by everyone except his bosses at Langley (Brian Cox and Chris Cooper). There's a girl with a car who helps him get to Paris and who eventually learns of his memory loss and appreciates his skills, which have not diminished with his memory. Franka Potente is the girl, and that character is a nice balance between active and capable helper and ordinary citizen who feels pretty helpless when the bullets start flying. The last movie I saw with Matt Damon was ""The Good Shepherd,"" where he plays a CIA officer who loses his soul in the course of protecting his country. Here, he's a CIA ""black ops"" soldier and trying to find a soul. Is he ONLY a killing machine? And at the end, he's still loose -- and Brian Cox knows it . . . .",1417219200,,2179,4.4475
2330600,4,B0009WK5CW,"At first it struck me how different from the movie this book was. I loved the movies. However, I think the book is even better. I think reading it in the time period it actually was intended for - after Vietnam and in the midst of the Cold War - the story seems to have more genuineness to it. I enjoyed going through the mental struggles with Bourne as he tried to learn about himself, something not as prevalent in the movies. I definitely intend to continue the series.",1417219200,,472,4.314606741573034

2330626,4,B0009WK5CW,"Matt Damon stars as a man who washes up on an island in the Mediterranean Sea, suffering from gunshot wounds and amnesia in the film adaptation of Robert Ludlum's spy novel. He finds a microfilm planted in his leg containing the number of a Swiss bank account and ultimately learns that he is Jason Bourne, CIA operative.

Most of the movie follows Bourne as he tries to reclaim his life and survive a number of attempts to kill him. He soon realizes he's being hunted down by assassins and that he's very good at killing them before they get him as we are taken from the Mediterranean to Zurich, Paris and Berlin. There is an clandestine conspiracy within the CIA -- this is a Robert Ludlum story after all -- and the requisite character traits are present: waking up to discover you were able to speak half a dozen languages, had tens of thousands in a Swiss bank account and could out-fight Bruce Lee, and a number of well done car chase scenes.

This movie was much more violent and action packed and Matt Damon was a better choice to play Bourne than the 1988 mini series starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. I guess if you wanted to do a miniseries in the 1980s, Chamberlain and Smith were the default choices for the lead roles.",1413676800,,1245,4.504424778761062

2330632,3,B0009WK5CW,I personally found the content to be repetitive and somewhat fragmented. The writer depended far to much on 'filler' material.

He, Marie, Abbott, and  Conklin are in the story, but shelve all else about who they are and what they are doing.  In some ways, that made the story even more intriguing to see what Ludlum really did with these characters.

2330646,4,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne Identity is an action packed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat!  It was directed by Doug Liman who before this was best known for the movie GO which was about the events after a drug deal told from 3 different perspectives.  Back to this movie though, it was written by John August and it is about a man is picked up by a fishing boat, he has been shot and is without memory, then he must race to escape from a group of assassins and recover from amnesia.

The story is more based on the characters of Robert Ludlum's novel than the actual novel but that didn't mean it wasn't an exciting movie to watch.  It is the story of a man ""Bourne""(Matt Damon) who is discovered by fishermen who must nurse him back to health because he is bullet-riddled. He can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his memory based on clues that the fisherman gives him such as a Swiss bank account number of which, was implanted in his hip.  After getting to the bank he realizes that he is being hunted and takes off with Marie (Franka Potente) who he met at the United States embassy and they both go on a journey to find out who he is and why he is being hunted.  I have said this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and it will deliver.  Starting with the action that happens between the Swiss bank and the Embassy in London, to the car chases that happen all throughout the area.  One scene that I thought was impressive and is probably a reason why it won World Stunts Award for Best Work With A Vehicle was a car chase that included driving on sidewalks filled with people, navigating through small alleys, driving down stairs, a motorcycle slide, crashing through a glass door and a motorcycle crashing into a car and flipping over the vehicle.

This scene was by far my favorite of my movie because it was the the one that really gets you wondering if he is going to get caught or not.  The music really makes the car chase even that much more suspenseful because its the right music at the right time. Then seeing the Mini Cooper drive down the stairs was just amazing, I didn't want the car chase to end because the action and suspense in it was just amazing.

Matt Damon portrayed Jason Bourne well though at times it seemed as though he was a bit robotic with no emotion.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it when he had is fight scenes because you really come to understand why he fights like he does but as the person he should have shown a little more emotion.

Overall I would give this movie an B-.  The lack of emotion and chemistry between the main characters brings it down.  Its just hard to watch Matt Damon as a ""robot"".  I still give this movie a good rating because when it comes to the fight scenes he is amazing and the car chases really kept me on the edge of my seat.  All in all if you haven't seen this movie yet, go check it out.

2330664,4,B0009WK5CW,"I read this book a long time back and found it really enjoyable. It was fast paced and had an interesting premise - what happens if a spy with extraordinary skills loses his memory, is being hunted by people he cannot remember for reasons unknown to him. For readers, as for Bourne, things evolve slowly. It is people's actions which tell Bourne about friends and foes. Everything is a danger unless proven otherwise. The action is fabulous and the book really moves fast all over Europe. The main adversary is also built up in a nice shadowy way and balances Bourne very well.

However, Ludlum does spend a of time describing things. It took some time getting used to.

*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***
Also, the Matt Damon movie is very different from the book. In fact, apart from the name and the amnesia premise, nothing is same. As someone put it nicely - in the book Bourne thinks he is an assassin but is not, and in the movie he thinks he is an innocent who turns out to be an assassin. Big difference. So do not expect the book to have much to do with the movie (which I also liked a lot).",1408752000,,1092,4.348039215686274

I liked this telling of the story of Marie and Jason instead. Bourne is a gripping characters, his uncertainty and turmoil in trying to figure out who he was and why he had such lethal skills was well executed, and I am eager to see how he evolves over the course of the next few books.

2330688,5,B0009WK5CW,"THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a tense thrill-ride anchored by Matt Damon's strong central performance as a amnesiac assassin in search of who he is. It also kickstarted the Bourne series, which raised the bar for intelligent action films. There's not too much need to go into plot details, except that Jason Bourne is a former CIA-trained assassin who is nearly killed when a job goes south. He wakes up with no memory of what happened before and sets off on a mission to find out who he is and why he is being hunted. One aspect I really liked was the balance between action and drama. The action scenes are quite relentless, but the film also allows a relationship to be developed between Matt Damon's Bourne and Marie (Franka Potente), a woman he meets practically by chance. They each have their own somewhat similar problems, and they work together to try and fix them. Normally these types of movies just focus on the protagonist, but here the audience is also exposed and given insight into the other side: the people who are trying to bring Bourne back in. Although some suspension of disbelief is required, the movie does feel grounded in reality, especially considering the recent glut of leaks regarding the NSA. In my opinion, it was nice to see the inner workings of intelligence agencies, and to top it off, a smattering of government intrigue as well. I thought the plotting was very solid, and the performances across the board were very good. The only weak link I found was Julia Stiles as Nicolette, a Paris-based CIA asset who runs a safe house. I thought her role was slightly underwritten, and her performance wasn't as good as the rest of the cast. Moving on, the technical aspects of the film were all excellent. I thought that the action sequences were well-filmed and easy to follow in a geographical sense. The fights were quite intense and well-choreographed as well. Matt Damon makes for a good action star, and this movie is proof of that. The score was also quite good, and helped maintain tension throughout the nearly two-hour running time. All in all, I thought that this was an excellent action film that can hold its own against similar series, like James Bond (which this clearly was intended as). Highly recommended for fans of action films and thrillers. You won't be disappointed",1405814400,,2311,4.751243781094527

2330732,4,B0009WK5CW,"One of the classics and genre defining novels by Robert Ludlum, this is a book that combines the thrilling adrenaline rush of the best of this genre with a consistent current of identity crises and analysis. Utterly unlike the series of films that bizarrely carries its name-united only in the aspect of governmental espionage and personal amnesia-this begins with a bang and runs full tilt into a covert superhero coming of age (as the spy rediscovers his unique abilities), a dangerous mystery as he runs for his life, and a developing internal crisis of the self as he constantly has to examine and reevaluate who he was before his memory loss and who he would choose to be after. There is a subplot romance that, while often a trope of the genre, lends a believable heart to the story. While much of the politics and cold war era assumptions are now obsolete (until they come back again!), it is still a very enjoyable and extremely well-realized narrative.

2330742,1,B0009WK5CW,"After watching the movie The Bourne Identity I thought I would give the book a go. I really enjoyed the movie and most times the book is way better. Unfortunately this is one of the very rare times when the movie is way better than the book. I actually did not finish this book, my library loan expired before I managed to make it to the end. I only read 70% so...I usually have a very hard time not finishing a book once I start, but I just don't care enough to wait for this  book to come in again at the library to finish it.

The issue I had with this book? The writing made everything incredibly tedious or boring. I struggled to read it even though it should have been fun and exciting. I like the overall storyline, but the execution put me to sleep. Big shoot outs, escaping from the villains, all of it was just boring. Then in between boring action there was Jason being all who am I??? I understand why that would be important to him, but I got tired of reading it. I didn't really care about any of the characters, I didn't really care what happened, it was just unfortunate since the story itself was interesting.

2330745,5,B0009WK5CW,"I must admit that Jason Bourne is one of my favourite movie characters. Having seen all the movies so far released in this series, I thought it was time to start reading the books by Robert Ludlum, because given the chronological gap between these films and the films I imagined that they were very different. And indeed it is so. Apart from a few salient points of the plot, we are faced with completely different stories result of the socio-political landscape in which they are set.
Approaching a book of the 70s (1979 to be exact) is not always easy, because immediately you notice some outdated aspects of the language and also the settings that differ from what we are used to, especially for people like me who at the time were very young and do not have first-hand memories. However, there are books like this that are timeless. Although the way of narrating undoubtedly changed over the decades, some authors are already ahead of their contemporaries. One of this is the late Ludlum, who with his first book in the series literally caught me. The character of Bourne who suffers from amnesia and is afraid of being a bad person immediately made inroads into my heart. I couldn't help but love him. Ludlum is so good at diving into his fears and doubts that you must love this ""creature"" of his. Fragile and deadly, ruthless and tender, Bourne catapults us into a long adventure in Switzerland, France and the United States, where the difference between the good and the bad becomes thin, plunging the character deeper and deeper into an abyss. At every moment we fear for him, both for what may happen to him, and for what he might discover about his own past.
It's a nice long novel that can be read in one breath, one of those you wait for throughout the day.

The day Jason Charles Bourne came punching and shooting into our theatres was the day that spy films stopped being silly affairs with hidden gadgets, shiny tuxes, and fast women. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is hard, rainy, real, and ruthless.

Jason Bourne does not wear a tuxedo, nor does he drive an Alfa Romeo. Throughout the course of the film, the amnesia-afflicted super spy wears whatever borrowed clothes he can, and drives anything he can hot-wire. He never uses gadgets, choosing instead to deliver beat downs with magazines or ballpoint pens, treating CIA-trained assassins like so many bad puppies. His ingenuity and resourcefulness, coupled with his badassery, killer fighting styles, and Matt Damon's pure coolness makes Bourne one of the most memorable characters in spy cinema.

Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are fantastic as the CIA officials deep into the shades of grey. Clive Owen's assassin The Professor is a highlight, as is Julia Stiles technician Nicky Parsons. Never showy, always compelling, Liman's cast is diverse and memorable.

Speaking of memorable, let us talk a little about the action. Consider for instance, a scene where Bourne takes on a paid killer with nothing but a ballpoint pen. Or where he takes a Mini through the streets of Paris, down a stair case, on the sidewalk, and through traffic. The action in IDENTITY is riveting, brutal, fast-paced, and shot in that shaky--cam style that lends the film a documentary feel. Unlike so many other films, the shaky-cam serves the action well, and when combined with Tony Gilroy's fast-paced, convoluted plots, you have a smart and gripping action thriller.

In conclusion, The Bourne Identity is a must-see for fans of spycraft, smart films with a tinge of political, or good ol', non-CGI action. It's realism and relevancy, coupled with a great cast and Matt Damon's charismatic and cool performance elevate the material and make The Bourne Identity one helluva ride. 4/5 bullet ridden stars!

Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are fantastic as the CIA officials deep into the shades of grey. Clive Owen's assassin The Professor is a highlight, as is Julia Stiles technician Nicky Parsons. Never showy, always compelling, Liman's cast is diverse and memorable.

Speaking of memorable, let us talk a little about the action. Consider for instance, a scene where Bourne takes on a paid killer with nothing but a ballpoint pen. Or where he takes a Mini through the streets of Paris, down a stair case, on the sidewalk, and through traffic. The action in IDENTITY is riveting, brutal, fast-paced, and shot in that shaky--cam style that lends the film a documentary feel. Unlike so many other films, the shaky-cam serves the action well, and when combined with Tony Gilroy's fast-paced, convoluted plots, you have a smart and gripping action thriller.

In conclusion, The Bourne Identity is a must-see for fans of spycraft, smart films with a tinge of political, or good ol', non-CGI action. It's realism and relevancy, coupled with a great cast and Matt Damon's charismatic and cool performance elevate the material and make The Bourne Identity one helluva ride. 4/5 bullet ridden stars!

2330773,5,B0009WK5CW,"Wonderful book, plot and character development, both of Bourne and Marie especially. I actually saw the movie several times before reading the book recently. Between the two versions, the general condition of the main character Jason Bourne is basically the same, the very beginning of the plot is the same, then everything else is different. If you've seen the movie, and like the Jason Bourne concept, the book is very gratifying as another Bourne adventure. Bourne's character is shown to be more 3-dimensional than in the movie. The plot of the book always sustains its interest (getting me to bed later than I'd want on some evenings!)",1391472000,,640,4.990654205607477
2330774,5,B0009WK5CW,"I loved this movie for two reasons.

First, the direction and the action and the acting were great.  The music was a perfect ""Add"" to the story and the movie action.

Second, As someone has said, ""If President James Madison knew what was the American Government was presently doing, he would be rolling over in his grave.""  President Madison warned that a gradual transition of the United States from an Enlightenment-Age Democracy to a post-Enlightenment oppressor of its own citizenry concerned him greatly.

The Bourne Trilogy, beginning with this movie very accurately describes what kind of government, or at least what kind of ""Hidden Government"" this country has, has morphed into President Madison's nightmare. I can attest to this reality based upon what my own government has done to myself, as a physician, just following orders and accurately diagnosing / treating the diseases of sick Kuwait War veterans.  And the damage that has been done to me has not been done by highly skilled assassins such as Jason Bourne.  It has been done by what should be honest, impartial public governmental agencies at the direction of the Clandestine Agencies.

I don't know where Mr. Ludlum got his material, but he hits the nail right on the head.  We have a government that can become an oppressor and even an assassin of those who do not follow its wishes, even if its wishes are unethical, immoral and illegal.
And we now have sixteen clandestine agencies that work together, coordinated by the FBI (It was J. Edgar Hoover who set this entire system up.) that effectively collude to destroy those individuals who have done things that, even if they could not possibly know it, might possibly do things that might possibly embarrass the dictators of the world whom these Agencies have been working with to carry out what could be ends that protect our national security.

And I am all for protecting the National Security of the United States.  My father, Benjamin Baumzweiger Bauer, E.E. spent his adult creating technology that protected this country as well as technology that enhanced its entertainment industry, its broadcast industry, even NASA's Activities.  He was just given the ""Millennium Award"", awarded by the IEEE, a 450,000 international scientific, engineering and computer institute.  He helped inspire the greatness and power of this country.

He too would be rolling over in his grave if he know the way that the technologies that he created are being mis-used to create the quasi-polce state so accurately depicted in the Bourne Trilogy

This book tells the backstory of characters who the movie has chosen to leave out or change for convenience.  Do not despair, the book is every bit the thriller and for me more exciting than what plays out on the screen.  Ludlum is known for complexity in his thrillers, and this one does not disappoint.  You are never lost but you never see the twists that come upon you like a shadow from the darkness.

2330801,4,B0009WK5CW,"This is the type of book for someone looking for an action packed thriller.  There are times when a different action sequence is literally happening every 5-10 pages.  While reading you begin to have questions arise:  who is Jason Bourne?  Why was he left bullet riddled and floating in the Mediteranian Sea?  Why does he have a photo negative with an account number containing $7million in Zurich.  And why does he feel compelled to go to Paris?  Most of all, why are so many people chasing after him trying to kill him?  All of which get answered as Bourne and his Canadian love interest high tail it across Europe in search of answers to his past.

The best part of this book I felt was when Bourne didn't have the answers and was clueless as to his circumstances.  This included the scenes in Zurich where he follows a bank account and early in Paris.  As the information comes to him and the CIA/Treadstone story begins to weave itself in I felt the story slowed down and became kind of cumbersome.  It just lacked something that made the 1st half of the book so great.  It was b/c of this that I gave it 4* instead of 5.

I did really enjoy the ending as you learn the true identity of Bourne and his past with Treadstone.  In the end there is a fierce and deadly confrontation as Bourne, Carlos and Treadstone all end up together in close quarters as each lays out a trap to lure the other in.

I have not read any other Ludlum books, this 1 stood out on the library shelf b/c I had seen the movie.  I think it would make a good introduction for anyone looking to get into this author, or just pick up a good book filled with a whole lot of action.",1387497600,,1655,4.270096463022508

2330829,5,B0009WK5CW,"""The Bourne Identity"" is the first book by Robert Ludlum that spawned the very successful Jason Bourne series, and in my mind it is his best. The novel begins as a half-dead man with his body bloodied and riddled with bullets is dragged from the sea onto trawler in the middle of a storm. Less than three hours earlier he was shot and thrown into the sea by people intent on killing him for reasons he does not know or remember. Their mistake is in believing him to be dead. The man eventually finds himself in Zurich and discovers that his name is Jason Bourne, that he works for a covert company, and that an assassin he does not know is hunting him down.

Flashbacks trigger memories as Jason tries to figure out his identity, and in amazing fashion provide him with what he needs to avoid being killed. That is the beauty of this book - it is both a fast-paced, action-packed thriller and the story of a man desperate to find out who he really is - no matter the consequences. Full of suspense and intrigue with a unique twist on character development, ""The Bourne Identity"" is without a doubt one of the best thrillers ever written.",1381104000,,1137,4.440191387559809

2330841,5,B0009WK5CW,"First, let me say that I haven't seen any of the recent onslaught of Jason Bourne movies.  Apparently if you love the books, you hate the movies.  If you love the movies, you hate the books.  If you've never been exposed to either, you wonder just what all of the fuss is about.  The first of (what I think is) a three volume series was actually written almost forty years ago (around 1975), and I almost have to wonder why it took so long to make the adaptation to screen in the first place based on the apparent popularity of the series .

Our story opens up somewhere in Europe (I forget specifically where).  Some local fishermen discover a body floating out in the ocean and they haul in this near-corpse that is miraculously still alive.  In the nearby small port town, there's only one doctor, who apparently moonlights as an alcoholic.  The doctor slowly nurses back this mysterious shodden figure back to health, and the specimen is definitely a unique find.  The doctor discovers that this man has had many parts of his body surgically altered to radically change his physical appearance.  Definitely something sinister here.  It doesn't help when the patient slowly regains consciousness over a period of weeks only to be suffering from amnesia.  He has no idea who he is nor where he came from.  The doctor finds a microchip embedded on the man's body, which only contains some random information about a bank account in Switzerland.  So this is basically all the patient has to go on if he wants to discover his identity.

So this is where the ride really starts.  Without going into too much detail, let's just say that the man (he later finds out his name is Jason Bourne) is part of a clandestine government operation, and although he's supposed to know who he is, no one else is.  So when he starts arbitrarily showing up in places, such as the above mentioned  Switzerland bank, casually announcing who he is in attempt to find out who he really is, chaos, panic and a lot of shooting commences.  A lot of shooting.  Over a lot of pages.

All of this is only the beginning, and we're taken on an incredibly complex labyrinth of details from this point of the book forward.  It's very easy to get lost with all of the mysterious figures coming and going, and this is a book that must be read (at least by me) slowly and carefully.  There's simply too much to digest.  For someone like myself who only speaks one language, it doesn't help that 95% of this novel takes place in a different country other than the United States.  The author describes a lot of detail in these strange countries, along with elaborate, but appropriate names and descriptions.  I simply found myself getting lost with all of the foreign names and locations.  Example:  If this story took place in the good old U.S. of A., with American characters, it might describe a scenario in this manner:

""When I walked out of the Hilton, I saw a man that looked like Charlie, who was riding in a taxi when they drove past the Olive Garden on the way to the Main Street parade.""

Since, however, we're in places like Switzerland and Germany, what we get instead is:

""When I walked out of the Les Feltehtraum Sherrabere Deuz Kaptin, I saw a man that looked like Monsieur Von Klappentooff Schertzanhous who was riding in an AutoFrankenheis when they drove past the Gotte Zer Plettz Der Frouihenheppenhurffer on the way to the Des Mont De Shlavovitz on Perre"".

I realize that what I wrote is extreme jibberish, but this is exactly what it felt like to me after reading a couple of hundred pages or so of this book with all of its pristine details.  It made me wish that I kept a notebook on the side so I could take some copious notes that I could use for future reference.  There were several times when I just couldn't juggle and remember all of these complex foreign names and places.

Another key fault of this book is the female ""sidekick"", or ""accomplice"".  Apparently, Robert Ludlum decided that if this story was going to have some teeth, he simply needed to give Jason Bourne an ally to help him through this complex nightmare.  That, in itself, is o.k. and probably even desirable.  It also doesn't hurt that she's young, has auburn hair, beautiful, etc.  What the problem is, is how she's thrown into the story.  Near the beginning of this adventure, Jason kidnaps her.  Not out of cruelty, but necessity.  Remember, he doesn't even know who he is.  Of course, after the initial kidnapping, she's rightfully terrified out of her wits, and seems to scream ""Please let me go!"" at least a bazillion times during a dozen or so pages.  Well, without drudging up the plot, let's just say that these two somehow, amazingly, become not only allies, but lovers.  It seems a bit preposterous for her to address him throughout the remainder of the pages as ""my darling..."" after what this man put her through.  She's overall a good character (as I write this, I can't remember her name.  Not really important),I just wish a bit more care would have been taken into how she becomes involved.

So the story continues, and each page is packed with action.  Although I couldn't give you a very thorough explanation of who everyone in this book was, and what purpose they served, the story was overall enjoyable even though my head was spinning much of the time due to the complex plot.  The book manages to have a very satisfying conclusion, yet leaves room for more story, which I'm assuming will be picked up with the next books in the series.  I look forward to reading the next couple of volumes.  Some day.",1379203200,,5589,4.582661290322581

I would recommend buying these movies as a collection edition so you get all of them and save some money while doing so. The action is superb and the acting and casting was dead on.
Despite Mr. Damons liberal views, especially those regarding the Constitutionaly guaranteed right of everyone to keep and bear arms (Mr. Damon believes firearms should be outlawed), he seems to have no qualms whatsoever in making tens of millions of dollars making movies featuring the use of firearms in abundance. But that is the nature of the over the top liberal types. I would bet that when in public Mr. Damon has a bevy of heavily armed bodyguards yet he would deny you that same kind of protection on a basis that you can afford.

All in all, I have become a great fan of the guy deprived of memories, who had to fight them back in unfavorable circumstances.
But now I returned to his adventures in the written form, in hopes to draw some inspiration and details for Intelligence operations for my sequel, which is a spyfi. And indeed, I found some strings to pull at for my own book. For which I am grateful to the late Robert Ludlum (:
Some people argue the movie is better than the book, but to my mind, they're so different that there could be no comparison between the two. The book is like another parallel story, stemming from the bank's point of divergence, but more thorough, more layered, deeper.

2330889,2,B0009WK5CW,"""The Bourne Identity"" (the 1980 novel) is a mess. ""The Bourne Identity"" (the 2002 movie) is a minor masterpiece.  Equally astonishing is that the two follow-up ""Bourne"" movies (in 2004 and 2007) were just as sparkling and inventive as the first.  For sustained high quality, the 2002-2007 ""Bourne"" trilogy is one of the marvels of modern Hollywood movie-making.  Too bad the inaugural novel of the ""Bourne"" trilogy does not remotely approach the fluid style, conciseness, and inventiveness of the movie of the same name.

Of course, thoughtful and attentive readers will find both the novel and movies far-fetched.  This is scarcely a problem in the movies, because the speed of their action and the mystery of the protagonist's situation give watchers little opportunity to dwell on the improbabilities of the plot.  By stripping out some of the more roccoco plot elements, the movie's screenwriters also make the action somewhat more plausible.

Implausibility is not the greatest sin in fiction.  Great novels can have great implausibility (think ""Huckleberry Finn"").  But skilled writers will make you suspend disbelief, something Ludlum (at least in this novel) seems incapable of doing.  The prose is overwrought and the hero singularly unappealing.  In this the novel contrasts strongly with the Bourne character memorably played by Matt Damon in the movie.  In addition, Bourne's love interest, though certainly the most appealing character in the novel, is much less distinctive and plausible than the quite different character winningly played by the great German actress Franka Potente.

People who have seen the movies need not be worried that the movies take away the suspense of the novel.  The plot differences and even the differences in major characters are big enough so that readers will encounter plenty of surprises along the way.  Unfortunately, one of the biggest surprises is that an overlong, badly written, and confusingly narrated novel could be turned into such an entertaining and memorable film.  I kept doggedly reading to the end mainly to see how the movie screenwriters performed such a neat trick:  What did they jettison?  What did they keep?  What did they ignore altogether?  After reading the novel and seeing the film, most readers / moviegoers may agree with me that the screenwriters deserve A+ for their efforts.  Alas, the author deserves a gentleman's C, even from a generous grader.  Almost all that grade is earned for the ingenious conceit that fuels the action:  A spy who loses his memory.  Among the worst features of the writing is the truly horrendous dialog.  If you have friends or business acquaintances who speak like this, you would run for the exits.

I managed to read volume 1 of Ludlum's famous trilogy.  There's no chance I'll be reading installments 2 or 3.",1372291200,,2821,5.142857142857143

2330898,5,B0009WK5CW,"Having read thousands of books, I have made a list of the 7 that I would most want to secure for posterity if books were to become extinct.  This is one of those seven.  The list includes two books of history, four books of fiction (this is one of them) and one  book of historical fiction.
I like most of the Ludlum novels that I've read and I've read most of them, this being the first one.  It is believable, it is action packed and the plot ""hangs together"".  I appreciate the fact that the hero, David Webb, alias Jason Bourne, even though he is an amnesiac searching for his identity, does not spend too much time in wrenching emotionalism, contrary to the second two Ludlum/Bourne books.  These latter two Bourne books are also much less believable.  If you have seen the butchery of this book in the film version of the story starring Matt Damon, I'd urge you to read the book and/or to get the old version of the movie starring Richard Chamberlain in the title role.  That film follows the book quite nicely.
To give one example of the violence done to the plot of the book by the latest film version, (spoiler here) in the book Bourne is an assassin who was ""created"" to kill one terrorist.  In the film version he was a paid assassin who had killed many innocent people.",1370736000,,1281,4.3940677966101696

2330900,4,B0009WK5CW,"To say that Jason Bourne is similar to James Bond is something of an understatement and a very underrated claim at the same time. I mean, they even have the same initials! Some might say that it is just being cliched to compare the two, but in my mind, it truly works. Where Bond is suave and impressionable, Bourne is direct and doesn't really care what people think of him. Of course they are similar, but if one keeps a cool head and doesn't get too critical, both franchises can be enjoyed without any trouble. The film definitely departs from the source material, but not to its discredit. The film manages to transcend the genre by taking the places and names from the books and create its own original story. It follows the baseline of the books, but crafts a world for our main character which is plausible and modern enough to not even appear dated. The performances are all top-notch; as it should be, the persona Damon creates as Bourne is by far the best role in the film. I would say its absolutely one of his best roles - what one would call a tour-de-force performance. However, ample support is supplied from the rest of the cast also. Potente is especially good, and even though Cooper just seems pissed off all the time, it really is a testament to his acting abilities if one watches his other movies and understands his immense range. Something that only just recently came to me about these films is the diversity of the cast. There is Bourne, who is a definite loner, even when he's with Marie. He can never get over the changes that his experiences have forced him to make, and he is therefore incredibly tortured by conflicting emotions and thoughts all the time. So no matter who he interacts with, the focus is always on Bourne. He functions in all situations the same, and deals with everybody (except Marie) more or less the same. He is what he is, and you either love him or hate him - no gray area. Then we have those who are tracking and/or trying to kill him, and they have their own separate part of the movie that only sometimes interacts with Bourne. Because of all this, everything is literally on Damon's shoulders to carry the movie, and that is why he is so great. Just like Bourne, Damon has to stand out. If he doesn't, then his role means nothing, and the viewer doesn't care about what happens. This is much like what happens in ""Unknown"", the fairly recent Liam Neeson vehicle, which has a very similar storyline to the Bourne films. The movie also fits in rather nicely with the other two, and creates a viable trilogy. One might say that they prefer Liman's directing simply due to the fact he doesn't use choppy editing like Greengrass did, but I understand the need for both methods in their element and could not imagine either one to be any different. As with all three of the Bourne films, the action is astonishingly simple once one gets used to it, and anyone is more than welcome to freeze-frame and follow the choreography. Some have said that the way these films compose the action sequences is unnecessarily fast and showy. I disagree. The films' choreography is a symbol for the character of Bourne. The action is literally so fast it's over before you even realize, much like it is from Bourne's side of things. Due to his amnesia, he doesn't understand what he's doing either, per se. It's a reflex for him to react the way he does. He just does it, without hesitation or remorse, which is exactly why he's so good as an agent. I will say that for me, the franchise's only disadvantage is for anyone who's never seen the films before. When I first watched the films, I didn't really understand it either. It was all too complicated for me at the time. But after watching all three of the Damon films (haven't seen Legacy yet) several times once I got older, I have progressively understood what is going on within each one. Once I understand what's going on, it's a piece of cake to invest myself in the story and characters. But for those who are beginners like I was at one time, the films probably seem horrible. That's when I would say to stick with them for the long haul - watch them all again, if you have to. I love these films, and I would strongly recommend them to anyone. Don't underestimate the awesomeness of Bourne.",1370563200,,4290,4.508344030808729
2330901,4,B0009WK5CW,"It is a good action and adventure movie. It shows the risks and the dangers Bourne was willing to take in search of his identity. All his gifts and abilities, and all his money, could not make up for his need to know WHO HE IS.

The application of the movie to our life is remarkable. It reminds me how empty and meaningless my life used to be before I found my identity in Christ. That's when I truly found myself. Until then, in spite of all my accomplishments, I had no idea where I came from (spiritually speaking) and where I was going. Just existing is not enough. We all need to know who we are, where we come from, and where we are going. What is the purpose of our life? Purpose gives meaning. The higher the purpose, the more meaningful our life is. Money, power, and people cannot fill the void in human life - the void of knowing who we are.

Bourne was willing to go to extreme, not only to find who he really was, but also to free himself from the slavery of those who were using him as a killing machine, and to choose his own destiny and purpose in life.

His companion, Marie, brings out the beautiful human side of Bourne. In order to protect her, he sends her away and gives her all his money. At the end of the movie, he looks for her and finds her running a successful business in a beautiful, paradise like resort area, by the sea.

Damon manages to make the audience emotionally invested in Bourne, a highly efficient killing machine created by a secret government operation (of course), and his get-away partner, Marie.  That emotional connection to Bourne resonates througout the series and humaizes the character, even throughout all the car chases, fist-fights, and explosions.

Not so.  Ludlum's writing style is emotive and smug, reminding me somehow of Ayn Rand.  He also finds catch phrases he lives to use over and over, which, while their initial impact has value, become trite in their repetition.  I have to admit I was taken by this first novel, but the 2 subsequent Bourne novels by Ludlum are merely rehashes of tge,same plot, same protagonist, same territory.  As I come toward the end of The Bourne Ultimatum, I begin to wonder (without being sexist - just making an observation) if ""Robert Ludlum"" is not the pen name of a woman.  As I stated before, his writing is emotional, more so than is necessary or realistic, especially in his dialogue (and inner monologue) passages, to the point that tge novels take on a comic! book! quality!  Yes, there are lots of exclamation points and lots of ejaculative remarks.  By the third book (the second, in reality), this has become tiresome, making the stories superficial and off-putting.

The style is choppy and clipped, and narrative is cut up with such brilliant devices as - Why? Who? Where? etc. The action is clumsy and lacks realism, the characters are cartoonish, and the constant violence just gets tiring after a while. Conversations are flat and boring, without revealing much about the characters. If Ludlum is a master of clever plotting, he is certainly no writer of any quality, and definitely not an engaging story-teller. Personally, I prefer Le Carr or Grisham for creating a more complete, complex worlds in their novels; writers who master details, action and conversation. For that matter, Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are much better written. This book is a  classic example of a mass-market junk novel.",1368489600,,847,4.923076923076923
2330916,4,B0009WK5CW,"I have to preface this review by admitting that I don't, as a general rule, like spy thrillers.  I've never read any of Ludlum's books nor am I likely to after watching this film.

I found this movie to be a wild kaleidoscope of utter confusion, solved in the final few minutes with no degree of satisfaction.  But.  It is incredibly absorbing in that we're strung along for the bulk of the film, learning very little along the way, and yet there is a high interest in what happens to this poor little putz who can't remember who he is or what he's done to deserve so many attempts on his life.  I actually found the reason behind the need to kill Bourne a bit dopey.  Bourne was never the problem; the old farts in charge of Treadstone were the problem.  Anytime you construct something that elaborate and unwieldy, you are doomed.  Too many people to keep track of, too many lies, too much of a paper trail.  When things go wrong, as they inevitably do, the first impulse is to lie, cover-up, or dispose of those perceived of as threats; no one wants to get caught, and yet they put themselves into a predicament where that's the only outcome.  Very little of that is entertaining because it's expected.  The only surprise for me was that I liked this movie in spite of the fact I hate these kinds of conspiracies.

Kudos to Matt Damon for creating a believable and sympathetic character.  I've watched this movie twice and liked it both times; I'm definitely adding it to my collection to watch again.",1368403200,,1504,4.485294117647059

2330938,3,B0009WK5CW,"This movie can solidly stand on it's own legs for fans of the Action & Adventure cinematic genre.
Although they never (originally) intended to launch a franchise with this film, it lays a solid foundation for the the 21st Century Cinematic Bourne Franchise - which gets better as it goes, and creates its own distinct universe separate from the Ludlum novels.

However - Literary fans of the Espionage/Spy Thriller genre, or passionate devotees of Ludlum's intricately detailed, masterfully woven novel may be ""left flat"" in this screenplay & adaptation. While the 1980 novel and this 2002 film bear the same name, that is about all they share in common. Much like Jason C. Bourne and ""Jason C. Bourne"" (after Tam Quan: 3-25-68), that is where the similarities in character and conduct end. If the original 1980 novel is a three-dimensional cube, pyramid or well-rounded sphere, this theatrical version is a flat square, triangle or circle, The novel gets your adrenaline racing and on the edge of your seat through literary gifts of richly detailed, nuanced prose with characters that you are emotionally invested in. This 2002 film depends upon the gifts of the genre (music, quick cuts, camera angles, the famous car chase) to get the same result, wrapped in Eurostyle type and 21st Century graphics.

***SPOILER ALERT***
(Medusa Operatives Only Allowed Past This Point)

From the minute the protagonist is fished out of the water, the film starts to veer away from the novel.
Like it's action sequences, the film moves through the plot at a hyper speed, leaving no time for the details from the novel. Significant mysteries are revealed/solved within the first 15 minutes - effectively degenerating this into an interchangeable ""chase"" film with waifish protagonists & incompetent/corrupt CIA ops, rather than a master spy & espionage saga with unique characters. Its goal is to impress its audience with speed, not substance.
The literary character of ""Bourne"" himself perhaps suffers the most as a result.

* There is no anatomical or psychological explanation given as to why ""Bourne"" has lost his memory, and the way the character is on screen, we don't really care or feel his pain - just superficial sympathy for him.

* From the fact that ""Bourne"" has been missing for only two weeks in the movie, to the fact that the CIA is revealed in the first 15 minutes (with Treadstone diminished to a mere subdivision), it sacrifices the espionage-driven depth that made the novel a page turner.
By this point, we know who ""Bourne"" is, and who he's working for. In the novel, ""Bourne"" has people coming at him from EVERY direction of the multi-layered lie that is his life. In the more two-dimensional film,  there is only Treadstone after him. Also in the novel, ""Bourne"" was literally ""one-of-a-kind."" Here, his ""hunters"" have all the same skills & training, cheapening him into one of many interchangeable assassins.

* By the time ""Bourne"" makes it to the bank (again, only 15 minutes into the film) we see the first hint of distinction between the film's  ""Bourne"" and the literary one. This one is NOT the ""Master-of-His-Situation,"" but is in perpetual reaction to everything around him. In the novel, the character maintained self control. even without his identity. Here he looks like a little lost boy that we feel sorry for because he's been out in the cold all night. The way that treasured materials from the safety deposit box are handled is panicked like a burglar - neither elegant or dignified like the character from the novel.

* The literary ""Bourne"" does everything in his power to stay ""off the grid"" and inconspicuous while unraveling the mystery of his past. For this movie showcasing special effects & car chases, that's quickly discarded as Damon's ""Bourne"" does everything in his power to create as many ""scenes"" as possible. Any talents of ""Bourne""'s from the novel that are incorporated into the film (scaling walls, etc....) lose their impact because they're unfortunately one of many special effects.

* The character of Marie also ""pays a price,"" as here her loyalties are bought & paid for with some cash, eliminating the conflict between the two characters and the gradual growth of their relationship as seen in the novel.

By 1 hour and 22 minutes into the two-hour movie, you're so saturated in the action that you find yourself either forgetting or just not caring that the character has amnesia. By the end of the movie, you really don't CARE about the characters (even ""Bourne""), you're just being entertained by them.

The novel leaves a strong lasting impression, this movie is more of a ""quickie,"" neither thought about, reflected on, or appreciated (beyond special effects) after it's over.",1364860800,,4735,4.979746835443038

2330945,4,B0009WK5CW,"Ludlum's first in this series. It was difficult to put the book down. The thriller was gripping enough for me to look forward to finishing the dinner to return to this world Ludlum created.

A must read, but I should warn you; it might end in addiction to the Bourne series.",1363996800,,274,4.372549019607843
2330946,3,B0009WK5CW,"I had reason to read this again after a loooong time, not really remembering much about it.

First, forget the movie. The only things the book and movie have in common are the title and the names of the main characters. This can be both good and bad. The good part is that you don't know what's going to happen based on Matt Damon's adventures; the bad part is that it's not nearly as much fun.

This is about as close as Ludlum gets to a semi-realistic espionage thriller. He'll never be mentioned in the same breath as LeCarre and Silva as someone who ""gets it right,"" and his taste for subterranean conspiracy and ultra-secret global cabals is what put me off him to begin with. Still, here he manages to rein himself in. Bourne himself is more sympathetic than most literary killing machines (his body count is far lower than Matt's), and even though his flashbacks happen in the most conveniently inconvenient times, you still get a good feeling for the angst he suffers from not knowing which of several competing histories is his. The twists and turns aren't always predictable (this is a good thing), and Ludlum is quite capable of vividly setting and managing a stage.

Two aspects of this novel proved problematic for me. First is the heroine, Marie. She's presented as a smart, educated woman with a responsible grown-up government job...who falls deeply (almost irrationally) in love with Bourne after less than eight days together, during nearly two of which she's his hostage(!). Really? When you spend 4/5 of a novel asking ""Why is she doing that?"" and the only answer is ""She's in lurve,"" you know there's a problem.

Second is the antagonist. When Ludlum wrote The Bourne Identity, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez - aka Carlos - was the hot flavor-of-the-week for global terrorism and not a great deal was known about him. So Ludlum makes him the invincible terrorist genius-mastermind who has suborned officials both high and low on every continent except Antarctica, has limitless resources and eyes on every street corner (that global cabal Ludlum was so fond of). It probably worked in 1975. Now, however, we know what a thug and clown Carlos was, that he botched many of his operations, and that he spent a lot of time scraping for money from one sponsor or another. As such, it's mostly impossible to take seriously his portrayal in this novel. We can still read and believe a period piece like LeCarre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy because we know the Soviet security services truly were formidable adversaries. Bourne, already saddled with some big credibility problems, struggles mightily to survive this sucking chest wound.

Having re-read The Bourne Identity, I have no interest in going further in the series. It's very much a product of its time and should be read as such. I remain convinced that Ludlum's most entertaining book was The Road to Gandolfo, in which he mercilessly lampooned himself to great effect.",1363824000,,2936,4.852295409181637

This is the only one directed by Doug Liman, who performs masterfully behind the camera; although he is the executive producer for the two follow-on films. This is of course based on the Robert Ludlum novel; and having read the novel many years ago, I do see some familiar reference points...the plotline, however, has been radically changed and updated. Please, no whiny complaints that this is not a faithful adaptation of a favorite novel. The screenplay, as written by Tony Gilroy, is intelligent and portrays a compelling and mostly believable espionage story. The only part that strained my credulity meter a bit was the clandestine obfuscation and confusion regarding the CIA black ops operation called ""Treadstone"". Perhaps it will be clearer to you than it was to me. Matt Damon was an inspired choice as the title character, Jason Bourne; as was Franka Potente, as his partner and love interest, Marie. Don't know what film some other reviewers were watching, but I saw excellent chemistry between the two...the romantic aspects are downplayed in favor of character development and action...which is fine w/me. Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are excellent as CIA management operatives...Cooper as head of Treadstone and Cox as his supervisor. Also look for Julia Stiles who plays a CIA logistics technician and Clive Owen, who plays one of the assassins sent after Bourne.

The book is about a man named Jason Bourne who loses his memory and wakes up in the middle of the Mediterranean and his trek to recover that he used to be. However many people who try to kill him obstruct his journey and he must act to stay alive. Bourne meets a woman who becomes his accomplice for the book, after he originally took her hostage. The book is incredibly suspenseful, and well written. This is a book that any reader will find entertaining, and will be a hard book to put down for any stretch of time. Ludlum does a great job by slowly integrating and weaving together a fantastically complex and intricate plot. The plot covers many different countries, and weaves together incredible realizations, and intense action to lave the reader on the edge of his seat, even though it is a book. The culmination of the story is a action packed chase through an apartment building in New York City. However, the book might have some drawbacks in some people's eyes. First off, they might not like the plot to be so complex, instead favoring a simpler plotline. They might not like the style of writing, or the number of character that play somewhat significant roles.

In the item description/product info it says that this is a 2 disc edition, however it only includes one disc. This is where my main complaint comes in. The disc is double sided, meaning that one side is in DVD format, while the opposite side is the Blu-Ray format. In my opinion, this is a totally dumb way of releasing movies as one of the sides is prone to scratches, affecting its longevity.

On the positive side, it includes an insert with a code to download a digital copy. I want to commend Universal for re-releasing great films in Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy bundles at such a great price.

The movie is smart, and the dream of anyone that has had head trauma. The art direction is not limited to one country making the story line almost limitless; and the camera angles and characters have a very grounded sense of reality.

2331028,2,B0009WK5CW,"I think I first read this in the mid-eighties, and thought it great. Upon re-read, it's closer to a one star than a five. The first 10% of the novel is five star action, then it takes a dive and never comes back. Once the love interest shows up, the prose turns idiotic, the dialogue stupid and sophomoric, and all the supposedly smart characters behave in stupid and irrational/moronic ways. It's like Ludlum just started using cardboard cutouts for characters and imbued them with unbelievable characteristics to push the plot along. ""I'm the naive but honorable french general!"" ""I'm Bourne, who must remind the reader every 5 pages that I'm conflicted via lousy inner dialogue because I can't remember everything from my past!"" ""I'm the love interest, who inexplicably decides I'm madly in love with Bourne and he is honorable after he slaps me around and I'm raped, no matter what evidence I'm presented with!"" And on and on. I was shaking my head at how trite and bad most of the book is from around the 13% mark, and it just kept getting worse. I would rate this one star, but give it two out of respect for Ludlum's name. Oh, and the British spelling on everything (tyre, kerb, saloon for car, bonnet for hood, and on and on) and numerous typos were inexcusable for a work from a big name AMERICAN author via a major publishing house for $10.

2331035,5,B0009WK5CW,"I give this and all Bourne movies a five star rating. Why? Because of the concept, character, and Genre. These movies have a sense of reality and action that others don't. They have a theme that runs through them all, and that is Government misuse of not only people they don't like but even their own. They use their assets for their agenda and then when that asset becomes to knowledgeable or independent they are expendable. Covert ops and black ops are a Pandora's box for the Government, and no one wants to get caught with their hands in the cookie jar. These movies are all based on the writings of Ludlum who himself had an agenda of exposing what really went on behind the scenes and the dirty little secrets they kept from the public at large. These secrets are not secrets anymore but are becoming all to evident in our lives as we look around and see tell tale signs. My only complaint is that these movies take bits and pieces of Ludlum's novels and create their own story lines and screen plays which bear little resemblance to his brilliant writing or his books. For instance it is never shown in the movies what the origins of the character Jason Bourne really are. Nothing is said of his life with the secret organization called Medusa in the killing fields of Vietnam, how he developed his skills, and how he really acquired the name Jason Bourne. The movies finally show us his real name of David Webb but fail to mention that he assassinated the real Jason Bourne who was in the group Medusa and turned rogue. Nothing is said of the government operation to use David Webb as bait to draw out Carlos the Jackal by using the name Jason Bourne and building a reputation as a rival assassin. These facts are just the tip of the iceberg regarding what's in the real stories or novels upon which these movies are based. His companion Marie is never killed in the novels as she is in the movie but becomes his wife and fellow comrade. But again having said all that, the essence of the novels is somehow captured enough to make these the best spy / covert ops movies around. So far!",1354838400,,2095,4.458333333333333

The first time I read it, I really didn't know who the character was or how the story would end.  I love reading books where I don't know what is going to happen.

Ludlum did a tremendous job of developing his characters (Jason Bourne, Marie St. Jacques, the Monk, Alex Conklin, etc.).  It wasn't until the very end that I really understood what he was trying to do with his characters and he kept me reading well into the night trying to find out.

2331043,1,B0009WK5CW,"Just couldn't go through with it. I hate it when I read through 300 pages and just cant bear to read on.

Since we know that the basic premise of the book is based around Bourne losing his memory, What was really annoying about this book was that each and every twist, turn, introduction of a new locale or character, is credited to his 'intuition', 'gut feel', or 'sudden flashes', which is alright the first few times, but then his intuition and gut, pretty much takes the whole story forward.

It's established that Jason Bourne is an expert, but it seems to me that he's an expert at nothing else but exploiting his 'gut feeling'. There is no intellect or logic behind any if his actions. Hes just a pair of well trained arms with a huge gut feel. If anyone, I thought his accomplice was a more interesting character than Jason Bourne who's just one big 'DUMBO' with a gun.

The plot was very slow, superfluously detailed and really boring in parts.

I picked this book up cause I really enjoyed the movies, and I was looking to get a deeper dive in the world of espionage and thrill, but disappointed.

I have read other Ludlum books.  I think he sould stick to basic writing skills.

Respectfully - Henry's Review",1352937600,,243,4.975
2331048,4,B0009WK5CW,"Back in 2002, the world was introduced to Jason Bourne.  Some of us knew who he was based on the novels written by Robert Ludlum.  I hadn't ever heard of the books at the time, but a friend of mine was all about them and so we went to the movies and he was disappointed and I was engrossed.  Apparently, the movie was A LOT different than the novels, (I've still yet to read the books), but it didn't matter much to me (or the movie going public).  Even my friend had to admit after he had time to settle that the film, as a whole, was pretty much everything it promised to be.

Slick, gritty and engrossing, `The Bourne Identity' springboards a great trilogy that only got more established and more entangled with each new thread.  Now, I have not seen the new Bourne film (with the overrated Renner) but it's not really a Bourne film, so it doesn't count.  Damon is superb in the role, perfectly guarded and mysterious while maintaining his genuine charm throughout.  He is a true movie star here, balancing skill with charisma to create a character we want to watch.  Damon understands shading Bourne's amnesia and he does so in a way that feel genuine.  In fact the whole mystery is worked out rather brilliantly here (and in the subsequent films).

For fans of action films, this is a must see.  Compared to the sequels, this film doesn't pack as much of a punch.  It lacks the chaotic energy that Greengrass brought to the series (although I applaud this films use of editing far more than the spastic cuts in `Supremacy') but it grounds the story and tells us something very intriguing and very impactful.  It stands up even ten years later.",1352937600,,1648,4.4865771812080535

When the boat arrives at the port the captain gives him a small amount of money to get to the bank in Switzerland.  He takes the train but he does not have enough for a room so he sleeps on the street on a park bench.  Two policemen roust him up and the man suddenly begins speaking fluent Swiss.  He then quickly knocks out and disarms the two policemen in seconds.  He is a master of martial arts and he did not even know that he could do that.

Jason Bourne is the exact opposite of the typical spy. The Bourne Identity shreds away every stereotypical clich in the spy/espionage genre to create a brilliant paced tale with wonderful layers of action, adventure and thrills to keep you entirely focused on the screen. The Blu-ray contains a memorable film with plenty of extras and suburb video & sound to make this the definitive release of Identity.

Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, a man stricken with amnesia; he can't remember his past, only that he can speak different languages, instantly fight off several men and swiftly evade the people attempting to kill him. This film proves Damon can act & fight as a lost spy in a post 9/11 world, his pleasant, though serious personality makes it a delight to root for him as he discovers his questionable, violent history. Marie, played by Franka Potente, is more than the common girl in distress as she joins in helping Bourne elude a CIA operation called Treadstone, run by Conklin (Chris Cooper), an operative that's not afraid to get his hands dirty. Brian Cox & Julia Stiles round out the supporting cast but don't take up too much screen time, shame as Cox's Abbott seems to be very involved in Bourne's precedent.

Director Doug Liman brings the Robert Ludlum novel to life, updating the story and bringing forth some elements while keeping most of the direction on the characters and main plot. The fight sequences are very realistic and excellent choreographed, matched with a thrilling Mini Cooper chase scene and nail biting final confrontation scene near the finale. The entire picture takes place in the snowy landscape of France and Switzerland as a classical score plays in the background.

The Blu-ray has excellent picture, showcasing the cities at winter time and few explosions in the action centered scenes. The audio matches the picture in excellence, especially to those with a sound system. Plenty of extras such as deleted, extended and alternative scenes, interviews on Robert Ludlum and all the Bourne novels, custom commentary and making of scenes, all the same special features brought over from the DVD release.

Last Words B+, a strong story minus computer effects & common action formula turn the spy genre upside down.",1345939200,,2345,4.971938775510204

When this movie initially came out, I was very reluctant to see it. I had this weird and stupid bias against Matt Damon for whatever reason I can't even remember now, but that's in the past. Once I got wise, though, my very first viewing of this film (as well as the rest of the trilogy) came in the form of their BD releases. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised, especially for this being the first of three parts in an overall story. The film begins with the discovery of a man in the ocean by a group of fishermen; a man with two bullet holes in his back, a Swiss bank account number in his hip, and no memory of who he is. He can fluently speak foreign languages and is apparently a master in firearms and fisticuffs, but still can't remember his name or how he ended up where he did. In reaching the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport. The name inside: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Also in the box are multiple other passports, all with the same picture, but different names. And so, Bourne embarks on a journey to find out who he really is, meeting a gypsy woman named Marie (Franka Potente), in which they face assassins and conspiracy coverups with only each other to depend on.

For me, this movie not only re-defined the spy-thriller genre (James Bond should thank this franchise because I think his recent incarnation was really influenced by it), but it made me a huge fan of Matt Damon. It's a gritty, more realistic, and down-to-earth depiction that relies less on flash and pizazz and tells a very humanistic story. If I were to break it down, I would say the appeal comes from about a third in the writing, a third in the acting, and a third in the score. The writing succeeds a lot in terms of subtlety; it doesn't explain a whole lot, but leaves enough for the audience to understand and empathize Bourne without ever getting ahead of him. This, in turn, is brilliantly performed by Damon who's portrayal is just as subtle as the writing; he's cool, calm, and collected, yet carries a certain degree of violence and ferocity when his training kicks in. And then there's the music; John Powell creates a very engaging score with three particularly crucial elements that, in my opinion, really drive the film: Bourne's main theme (which adds a sense of mystery and intrigue), a lot of percussion pieces (which sound great for action sequences), and the trademark whirring effect (that foreshadows Bourne's time to kick ass). The Bourne Identity is a very well-made spy-thriller that, as director Doug Liman puts it, ""is made with a lot of European sensibilities,"" making this a very refreshing take for the time it was made. Not only does it provide the mystery and action of a spy movie, but the additional cerebral aspect makes it that much more enjoyable. And it only gets better in the sequels.

The Bourne franchise makes its first entry onto high definition with a pretty good transfer. I say ""pretty good,"" which may seem a bit generous considering a couple of gripes I have with it, but all in all, I'd say the pros outweigh the cons. Let's start with the good. General detail and sharpness look great, capturing some excellent scenic shots, revealing a decent amount of line delineation between clothes and objects, and showing some of the finer features on peoples' faces and hair during closeup shots. Colors are vivid, albeit slightly de-saturated, with lots of reds and orange being at the forefront of the spectrum. The red bank bag that Bourne wears around the beginning of the film tends to especially stand out, along with the occasional random red object in the background. The jacket he also wears in the beginning and the one big explosion that the movie has literally explodes orange when it does happen. Skin tones are very lifelike with great variation from person to person and reflect accordingly depending on the lighting of the scene. Black levels aren't super-deep, but do enough to help accentuate the intrigue during darker scenes or nighttime shots. The film also supports a nice, light layer of grain and never gets in the way.

The two bad things? Contrast and damage. Contrast is generally a tad on the low side giving the movie a kind of murky look with even daytime shots looking a little on the dim side. The detail is still good enough, but compared to other movies I've seen with low contrast that still manage to have a pristine picture, this one doesn't really hold up. Throughout the course of the movie, there are also various instances of dirt and even one or two moments where scratches from print damage popped up for a split second. They're not terribly obvious, but they are noticeable. In the end, though, Oliver Wood's photography looks great and really helps to maintain a very earthy, yet exotic look to the cityscapes, indoor sets, and wider-viewed shots. My favorite parts to look at are the snowy streets of Zurich for it's variation in color around the city, the shootout at the farmhouse for its detail, and the nighttime shots around the end of the movie for the blacks.

While the video portion of this disc isn't quite perfect, the audio comes much closer. As I mentioned about the music being an integral part of the film, interestingly enough, the movie opens with the Universal credits, but doesn't play the Universal theme. Instead, it's starts out silent and fades into the sound effects, then into the main title theme of Bourne. General immersion is excellent with the score having a pulse of its own through a lot of the drumming beats and tense string pieces. And then, of course, there's that trademark whirring effect, which when played, really enhances the mood of whatever is acting out on screen. Directionality and separation dominate the sound field when action sequences take precedent, though dialogue thankfully remains clear regardless of how loud a crash, gunshot, or broken window gets.

In particular, I was very pleased with how well-isolated the effects were in the scene where Bourne is fending off the first Treadstone assassin. When the guy breaks in, it was completely quiet beforehand, and then all hell broke loose. But even then, when Bourne and Marie are being pursued by the French police, the car chase sequence does a bit of the opposite by having a very lively mix of automotive chaos and snazzy Euro-techno that almost felt like a scene out of The Transporter. I would say this scene utilizes the rear speakers best with some very aggressive effects as some of the cars come buzzing around tight corners and others start crashing into one another. And then towards the end of the film when Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character, we get a great example of the middle road. It's isolated enough like the first assassination attempt when Bourne blows up a tanker providing some real pounding LFEs, but then it also feels very immersive when he fires another shot and the birds in the field start flying around. To sum it up, The Bourne Identity has a great sound design and mix. The actual sound quality has a lot of depth to it, with both the high and low ends displaying great dynamic range. As a whole, it's not quite reference material, but I would liken that more to the nature of the film itself having a lot of quieter moments. But rest assured, though, that the sequels will definitely fix that right up.

Extras - 4.5

- Audio Commentary (Director Doug Liman)
This is a very informative track with a wealth of information that covers a wide variety of aspects from the writing, casting, filming, set designs, editing, scoring; you name it. Essentially, what I found most interesting were the comments Liman had about the heart of the story and its presentation; namely, how he wanted to bring a sense of grit and realism to the spy-thriller genre, making it a drama, first, and an action film, second. He goes into great detail about the depiction of Bourne and how he and Damon collaborated to make the character feel subtle and empathetic, yet strong and determined throughout the circumstances of the story. In fact, Liman really stressed the parallels between the Kali fighting style that Bourne uses and how its core philosophy of energy conservation and quick, brutal efficiency ties into Bourne's overall demeanor. He later goes on to talk about character motivations and how Damon and Potente did particularly good jobs at humanizing the character of Bourne in such a way that, I feel, had a gradual impact on the look and feel of other modern spy-thrillers succeeding this one (here's looking at you, Bond). Oddly enough, there were a few very large dead spots, but for the most part, when Liman talks, he really lets loose.

- The Ludlum Identity (SD; 12:49)
Tells us a little bit about the famed author of the series, Robert Ludlum, namely, things like: how he made the transition from theater actor to novelist, how he tied those theater experiences into his writing, how a lot of the locales he came up with were inspired by post WWII-Europe, how he saw conspiracy in authority, and finally how he came to adopt the trend of 3-word titles for all of his works (""The [whatever] [whatever]"").

- The Ludlum Supremacy (SD; 12:41)
Talks about the origin of Bourne's name, Ludlum's personality in general and how it was reflected through the character of Bourne, some of the differences between the movie and novel (such as the omission of Carlos the Jackal), how The Bourne Identity boosted his status as an author, and then the eventual progression that was a result from Identity's success.

- The Ludlum Ultimatum (SD; 23:57)
This piece covers a pretty huge chunk of Jason Bourne's story arc between the first and second movie. If you've seen all the films by this point, then it's an excellent breakdown of the character, his motivations, and the themes they wrote into the plot. If by some chance this is your first time seeing Identity, do no watch this feature, as it will contain some major spoilers for Supremacy.

- Alternate Opening and Ending (SD; 10:46 altogether)
Starts with a brief introduction by the 3 guys listed below and mentions how the movie had to be adjusted after the events of 9/11 for the sake of changed sensibilites. They were concerned about the ""datedness"" of the subject material and how it would make audiences react. The alternate opening basically would have turned the whole movie into a flashback and tying up in present day at the end. They say they were pretty happy with the ending you see in the final cut (and so am I).

- Introduction with Producer Frank Marshall, Co-Writer Tony Gilroy, and Actor Brian Cox (3:33)
- Alternate Opening (2:16)
- Alternate Ending (4:56)

-Deleted Scenes (SD; 6:58)
Listed below are the individual scenes:

- Wombosi on the Private Jet (0:59)
- Bourne and Marie by the Side of the Road (2:29)
- Psychologist Discusses Bourne (1:46)
- Bourne and Marie Practice on Subway (1:42)

- Extended Farmhouse Scene (0:58)
Liman actually makes a quick reference to this in the commentary. He said this scene was left in the European version of the film, but then went on to say it was cut from the American version for ""timing reasons."" As if 58 seconds really makes that big of a difference in theater showings per day...

- The Birth of the Bourne Identity (SD; 14:31)
A pretty generic EPK-style feature that tells you how Bourne is different from your average spy-thrill title. It has very badly-edited interviews that are short and whose sporadic nature doesn't really tell you much at all. I recommend you avoid this if you're looking for actual depth and quality.

- The Bourne Mastermind: Robert Ludlum (SD; 5:44)
Mostly recycled information talking about Ludlum's transition from theater to writing. It offers a little more retrospect after the fact, but it's too short and not much more than you can hear about in the other features above.

- Access Granted: An Interview with Co-Writer Tony Gilroy (SD; 4:03)
Talks about the essence of Bourne and how the movies had to be adapted for modern times, as opposed to the Cold War mentality they originally had when it started in the '80s.

- From Identity to Supremacy: Jason & Marie (SD; 3:37)
Some interviews with Damon and Potente about the characters they play, how they interpreted their motivations, and the transition they had to make when filming Supremacy. Damon said that Bourne's actions are what he feels develops the character, while Potente praises how non-clich her character was and how the chemistry between Bourne and Marie is sporadic throughout the relationship.

- The Bourne Diagnosis (SD; 3:25)
Talks about the actual medical condition of the amnesia Bourne suffers in the plot. The psychologist basically says that Bourne suffers from Selective Dissociative Amnesia, but retains a Kinesthetic Memory of how to perform all of his trained skills. He also goes on to point out that the presence of Marie's character was a big help in portraying memory recovery.

- Cloak and Dagger: Covert Ops (SD; 5:31)
An interview with an officer of the CIA who talks about the overt and covert operations they actually do perform and how accurate the depiction of Bourne and all the training technicalities were.

- Inside a Fight Sequence (SD; 4:42)
Shows how the choreography was staged with stunt coordinator Nick Powell.

- Moby ""Extreme Ways"" Music Video (SD; 3:38)
A music video to the ending credits song.

- U-Control
There are 3 different interactive applications you can play along with the film:

- Treadstone Files
A kind of gimmicky computerization that simulates certain parts of the movie to feel like you're looking through a high-tech dossier. It shows a bunch of trivial factoids and statistics about the characters, the locations, Treadstone, and all kinds of other information.

- Bourne Orientation
PiP that plays like Warner Bros.' Maximum Movie Mode where the current scene and an older scene that may or may not contain interviews will split into 2 individual screens of their own and essentially rehash important plot points.

- Picture in Picture
A true PiP application that opens up a little box in the corner of the screen with additional interviews not seen in the special features. Altogether, it equates to about 25 minutes and is divided into 8 chapters of the scene selection. Some of the material covered includes: the action and how Damon wanted to do his own stunts, filming in Paris, Liman casting Damon as Bourne and what it was like working with him, the relationship between Bourne and Marie, a more in-depth analysis of Marie's character, and a short look at the other Treadstone agents through an interview with Clive Owen. It's a little disappointing there aren't more interviews, but it's pretty well-worth the information.

Overall - 4.5

For the starter of the bunch, The Bourne Identity is a very entertaining refresher into, what was then, a faltering spy-thriller genre. This Blu-ray disc looks pretty good with only a couple of minor problems, the sound is fantastic considering there's more drama than action, and the special features are very informative. It's a shame Ludlum never got to see this, but the people that knew and vouched for him are pretty happy with the way it turned out. The Bourne franchise has certainly changed the genre (just look at how Daniel Craig's Bond movies have shaped up) and for the better. If you haven't seen this yet, definitely pick it up, then wait to be amazed by its sequels.",1344470400,,15714,4.779579800958349

The man follows the bank account lead and begins to discover very odd things about himself, that he has an uncanny knowledge of how to kill without being detected, how to blend in to his surroundings and even how to change his appearance so thoroughly no one will recognize him, but how does he know these things?

I have never seen any of the Bourne movies and this is my first spy novel so I had no idea what to expect. I guess I didn't expect there to be so much discussion on every little thing and I had thought there would be a lot more action. There were times when I desperately wanted to tell the author to get to the point, or at least back to the fun action parts, but when it did come to the action it was so well written and intense I would feel even more irritated when I had to sit through more debate. Not only was this novel a brilliant action packed story but also a love story, Jason Bourne meets takes a woman hostage but then the hostage begins to be his only ally and the bond they form is remarkable. This was a well written and thoroughly addictive story.",1344384000,,1525,4.148648648648648

Matt Damon infused his Jason Bourne with believable emotions, and in my opinion his acting ability is well showcased in this film. You have to get past the explosions and chases (one of the greatest car chase scenes ever, by the way) and watch his expressions and gestures to notice...which is probably why the movie bears rewatching. I happen to love action-adventure flicks (like ""The Avengers,"" need I say more?) and this will likely be near the top of my list for a long time. The only reason I hesitate to give 5 stars to this genre is the ""suspension of disbelief"" factor involved.

I had great faith that these books were all they had been billed to be. Luckily, though I now also love the books, it hasn't tainted my love for the movies at all. Possibly because there are so many differences between them.

One thing is for sure, in either medium, Jason Bourne is no joke. This book is a thriller, and Bourne is pitted against a very worthy adversary. His life depends on what he can't remember, and as he slowly pieces the puzzle of his life together, he also allows his gut reactions to help him out.

I didn't think the forced romance was all that necessary in the movie, and I don't think it is in the book either, but some people like that and it didn't bother me too much.

2331094,4,B0009WK5CW,"A handsome young man (Matt Damon) is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat, unconscious. The man who digs a couple of bullets out of his back finds something else beneath the skin of his bottom: a small capsule with a laser that displays the name of a Swiss bank and an account number. It was the flashing of another laser embedded in his wet suit that had alerted the crew of the fishing boat to his presence in the water.

He does not know who he is. Thus begins one of the most amazing adventure and chase stories in 21st century films. Even for someone who read the book, it is thrilling. There are enough differences (although the sense of it is maintained) that even though I remembered the book pretty well, I didn't always know what was going on here. When Jason Bourne discovers his passport in the lock box which was connected to that bank account number, he discovers another half dozen, some with the name Bourne and some with at least one other name. The pictures are all of the face he has been seeing in the mirror. There is also a great deal of money in several currencies (the setting is apparently pre-Euro), a gun or two, and some communications devices.

So is he a spy? For whom? He clearly has incredible fighting skill, as he discovers when a couple of Zurich police hassle him for sleeping in the park. And a trip to the U.S. Embassy makes it clear there's something very fishy about all of this. He escapes with his life, but only just, and bribes a young woman to give him a ride to Paris.

The entire story is really one long chase, but the little red car zipping through all obstacles in Paris is probably the most amazing car chase scene I have ever seen in any movie. (Well, until the next film; I seem to remember there's a pretty amazing one there, too. Bourne tops Bourne?)

I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I will warn you that you may have to play this one two or three times to follow everything; the pace is just that rapid and the tale that convoluted. Much high-tech spy equipment, much ado about plenty. I defy anyone to predict what's coming next if they have not read the book, and half of those will get it wrong.

2331099,5,B0009WK5CW,"The opening of this movie is pretty much impossible to resist: many miles offshore, fishermen drag a man out of the Mediterranean Sea, unconscious and riddled with bullet wounds. There's nothing to identify the stranger, but the doctor on board finds a small microfilm while surgically removing the bullets.

When the man regains consciousness, he can't remember who or where he is and what happened to him. His only solid connection to his past is the microfilm, which contains a long string of numbers that sucks him into a whirlwind intrigue of black ops assassinations, government coverups, and corrupt politicians...and he's the epicenter of it all.

First, I think they did an awesome job translating the first half of the book into a movie. I think it would've been VERY hard to pare down the entire book into one screenplay, unless the movie was going to be 3 hours long.

The premise of this story is just plain fun. Since the beginning of civilization, Man has wondered if he has lived before and if so, why he can't remember. The Bourne Identity takes that ancient mystery and makes a great spy thriller out of it.

The plot is structured very well and the pacing is impeccable. It speeds up and slows down in the perfect spots and really builds the tension and mystery as you move through it. It was also intricate enough to follow and make you try to actively figure it out, but not so complex as to overwhelm you with details.

The acting is superb across the board. It's hard to imagine someone playing Bourne better than Damon. He completely steals the show.

If you're a guy, it's only a matter of time before you wish you were Jason Bourne. He's tough, smart, and incredibly resourceful, but not invincible enough to make you roll your eyes. Although the prime antagonist clashes with Bourne indirectly, through the proxy of other assassins and government agents dispatched to eliminate Bourne, he's capable and intelligent, and makes for a good protagonist vs. antagonist battle.

I'd be remiss to not mention the fight scenes, as they are some of the best I've ever seen. The choreography and editing is perfect--you really feel like you're watching highly trained, brutal killers just explode on each other with precision and speed. If you end up skipping back to rewatch them--especially the fight in the apartment--you're not alone. :)

If you like a fast-paced, realistic spy mystery/thrillers, then you'll love this movie.",1332806400,,2447,4.865384615384615

My only (minor) complaint is that the other characters were a bit cardboard. Marie had a little bit of depth, but most of the supporting cast only existed to forward the plot, which was all about Bourne. His plight is so enthralling, however, that you will hardly care.

2331103,2,B0009WK5CW,"I just want to say that this book opens very well. The main character suffers from amnesia, but when thrown into some crazy situations, he begins to discover his instictive talents. He speaks multiple languages, knows martial arts... Each discovery is a clue to his identity, and I thought that he would eventually piece everything together and slowly discover who he is.

Then the book slows down. A lot.

The action sequences in the beginning of the book are excellent, because they aren't just gratuitous scenes - they develop Jason's character. In sharp contrast, the action sequences in the middle of the book don't develop the characters... so they actually become a little boring.

For me, the discovery of Jason's identity was the thrill; but he stops discovering things on his own after about a hundred pages.

That's when Ludlum introduces all the other characters in the book. There are seriously about 32 extra characters in the book, and I have no idea who they are, because their only purpose is to give Jason a backstory. The problem with adding so many characters is that they have no consequence. There's no reason to know about them or care about them. Adding so many random characters creates confusion while taking away from Jason's development.

Also, there's supposed to be a villian of some kind in this book, named Carlos. The problem there is that readers don't really develop a reason to hate him, and he never becomes a villian. For the entire book, Carlos doesn't actually do anything wrong... he just talks. Why would Jason Bourne want to kill some guy that hasn't done anything bad in the book? There's no real sense that Carlos is an evil man. In fact, it's hinted that everyone who knows Carlos actually loves him. That whole situation made me feel detached from Jason's purpose.

Then, at the very end, instead of recovering his memories, Jason meets another random character who simply fills in his entire backstory - thus destroying the excitement of Jason discovering things on his own.

I really would only recommend the first hundred pages of the book. Ludlum's style is very strong, and the first hundred pages are very engaging. After that, the coolness of Jason Bourne gets lost in the backstory that's told by a jungle of random characters.",1330732800,,2282,4.850899742930591

The Bourne Identity is one of his best--a wild ride that makes the reader catch their breath as the intrigue mounts and mounts.  Bourne is a likable and pitiable character, a man driven to do things he cannot understand but must continue repeating them to get at the ultimate truth of who he was and where he came from.  The action is paramount in this novel, and Bourne turns out to be one tough and capable character.
Ludlum was always supremely skilled at his craft, he creates a DENSE plot that gets more intricate as the novel progresses, but never flags for an instant and also does not confuse the reader.  I really cannot see Matt Damon as Jason Bourne after reading this, I am glad I read the novel before I made the attempt at the movie.",1330387200,,891,4.481481481481482

2331107,4,B0009WK5CW,"Jason Bourne doesn't remember who he is, or why people are trying to kill him.  So begins an extended chase film and action movie.  Considering that Jason has amnesia and doesn't even remember his own name, you can hardly blame him for the mayhem that follows - he's just acting out of self-preservation.  With the help of Marie, he slowly begins to uncover details about his past, including the fact that that he was a highly trained CIA assassin involved in high level operations.  But now the CIA is trying to eliminate him - why?  While on the run from his own government, Bourne slowly makes a transition from confused amnesiac to an efficient combat machine, and at the end shows real touches of being sympathetic and human, even if this isn't entirely credible given his professional resume.  In fact throughout the story he comes across as genuinely concerned for the people close to him, and even while keeping the trained operatives at bay he's presented as a sympathetic character who isn't motivated by revenge or blood-lust, and any violence he causes only happens because there seems to be no alternative.

As far as action films go, there's something refreshing about the way that The Bourne Identity has made the transition from Robert Ludlum's popular book to the big screen, despite significant changes to the original.  The plot features a spy thriller narrative reminiscent from the days of the Cold War (although with a post-Cold War setting here), and raises compelling questions immediately from the outset, as viewers share Jason's desperate questions to discover who he is, why he has bullet wounds in his back and details of a numbered Swiss bank account in his hip.  The chase scenes and suspense rarely disappoint, and even though the body count in the film is reasonably high, gore isn't the central interest, and even the fight sequences are for the most part about efficiency rather than eye candy - there's no unnecessary bullets or explosions, and the end result makes the action more believable.  The extended car chase early in the film is one of the best you'll see in the business. Parents should be forewarned about several instances of profanity and blasphemy, but fortunately these don't dominate the film, and even the chemistry between Bourne and his counterpart is muted and relatively tasteful.

It's not suitable for children, but mature adults will find some decent entertainment here.  Much of it might be considered cliche and generic, but The Bourne Identity does a good job of it.  Fans of action thrillers will enjoy something that is fast and furious without becoming larger than life or over the top, and with a sympathetic fugitive that is just as much a man as a machine, and who has a real conscience.  This might not redeem the film from all its flaws, but it does go some ways to making it stand out from the average. - GODLY GADFLY",1327276800,,2890,4.823886639676114

Bourne is one such agent, who has been shot and has, thereby, lost his memory, has become, to himself, a man without an identity. The Agency knows his identity, however, and when he surfaces in his search for who he is, they (for very vague reasons of security for the Agency from prying Congressional eyes), set out to liquidate him. He meets a girl along the way, and, of course, they fall in love. With a simple plot to work with, the film produces a series of dangerous situations and heroic feats of combat.
The film carries no intellectual baggage to weigh down the action, which is brief, sharp, and, satisfying. The lovey-dovey stuff is kept to a neat minimum, the brief scene showing him to be a killer with a heart, takes no time at all.

A further quibble is the amnesia thing, a hoary old device used in really bad TV shows by lazy writers. But the two leads are a great couple and there is much chemistry. Doug Liman does a fantastic directing job here; too bad he did not helm the later installments, which I found almost unwatchable because of all the shaking cameras and split-second cuts.

2331128,5,B0009WK5CW,"If there is ever a novel worth labelling thriller, this is it. A real page turner from the word go - from first page to last and everything in between. This is the second Ludlum novel I have read, first being The Matarese Countdown which was quite average. This so much more infinitely better, well researched, well plotted, planned, characterised, thought out and with a fastpaced action packed narrative. If anyone thinks NYT bestsellers are not literature then they have never come across such masterpiece storytelling and probably live in a remote cave with their loathsome copies of Shakespeare or John Updike.

The Bourne Identity is a gripping tale of a man, his origins, his uncertain present and conspiracies that entangle a range of ruthless or unsuspecting people somehow associated with the man they don't really know. The movie version is set in a modern setting and far different from this novel but both are definitely greatly enjoyable taken individually. The book set quite a few decades ago (when it was written) deals with the enigma known globally as Carlos the jackal. Bourne and Carlos drive this story with each proving their worth without which they could be dead. A race against time across varying locations in differing situations that make you glued to the book you hold closer and closer as plans unfold, dead bodies discovered, news and its targets manipulated and an ever changing landscape for the protagonist with an unknown past and bleak future.

The beginning is the end and the end is the beginning. There is a covert mission for Jason Bourne but unexpected circumstances have made him lose his memory. His mind throws glimpses of images, some words stand out and he has not lost his ability for being a highly talented operative. The man is plagued by these things, not knowing where it comes from and what it means. Only one thing is clear - there are people out to get him, kill him and he needs to solve the puzzle that is his mind. To uncover where he comes from and why he has talents that are so unusual.

The novel is an exploration of not just the man's mind but the unexpected possibilities of covert missions, deception and the dangerous world of terrorism. This book does work as a standalone but of course Ludlum wrote 2 more of Bourne adventures. The thrill of the first ignites a passion to read on. Pick this up and forget the movie version for the time being. Both are great in their uniqueness. There are no cell phones or other gadgetry in this old novel but the novel isn't dated. If anything it proves how effective a trained person can be when dealt with uncertain and life-threatening circumstances. A real masterpiece from Ludlum.",1312156800,,2691,4.758029978586724

2331130,3,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne Identity, by Robert Ludlum, was one of my longtime-wishlisted, finally-a-bargain-price read on my Kindle when I purchased it, and I really, really wanted to like it. But, I found it slow and tedious, and a struggle to finish. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for reading it? Maybe I was expecting more Matt Damon? I'm not sure. But this was one book I'd rate only 'okay', and not as enjoyable as the movie was, for me. In the movie, I really liked how Damon created a vulnerable, yet necessarily strong character, which I kind of got in the book, just not as clearly. For the zillions of Ludlum fans, sorry... this one just wasn't my cup of tea.",1309737600,,656,4.429752066115703
2331131,5,B0009WK5CW,"Robert Ludlum is a new author to me. Recently I just went through this book, mainly because I enjoyed the movies so much! In short, my review is I could not put this book down! I was left captivated by every chapter, paragraph, and even sentence. The story was extremely well written, so much so that I wish the movie had not deviated from it as much as it did. The author sucked me into this book by creating a mystery around the character of Bourne. In the beginning of the book I did not know whether Bourne was, in fact, a good or bad character. This is exactly what the author intended to happen, evident by Bourne's own internal question over his character. When it was finally discovered that he was a good guy, I was so relieved as if I was Bourne myself! I have become quite fascinated over the character of Jason Bourne due to his Christ-like nature. Now, before people label me a heretic, let me explain.

Bourne is clearly a Christ-like figure due to his self-sacrificial attitude. He saved Marie from being brutally raped and killed, risking his own life in the process. Furthermore, we learn that Bourne paid the ultimate sacrifice for the entire country, and even world, by becoming Jason Bourne, the feared assasin and rival of Carlos the Jackal.

I think that the author did OK with the flashbacks which I know are much more diffficult to do in a book than in a movie. Again I just feel he used them too much and caused it to drag a good story line down. I do enjoy this type of special ops story and I will read the rest of the ""Bourne"" series, but it will have to go some to reach the level of Vince Flynn's ""Mitch Rapp"" Series.",1307491200,,524,3.81651376146789

The ending was too abrupt, tying everything up into too neat of a package and omitting a lot of vital details along the way, but I guess that's what the sequels were for.",1297987200,,601,4.901960784313726

3. Its a Spy/Action movie..I understand that there are going to be things pulled off that are un-realistic..and thats cool...I like movies like James Bond, Rambo, XXX, The Matrix, Expendables, and Crank..but watching Matt Damon fighting sequences are about as un-real as it can get..come on..disarming like 3people in 2 seconds, then kicking the crap out of another 2 in another 5sec...wow
I have nothing against Matt Damon..Great Actor...just not fit for this role..he's not a tough guy..and that what these movie wants us to believe, and since it is actually meant to have a story (which is does) its way 2 over the top with action that belongs in ps3 video games or movies like Crank..just not here...Alot of people liked it...and its spawned 2 sequals, which surprised the hell out of me..i just didn't buy into the hype",1295827200,,1105,4.701030927835052

2331139,5,B0009WK5CW,"I didn't expect to like this novel.  I'd tried to read Ludlum 20 years ago, because my ex-wife used to take his novels on vacation, and every so often I'd pick one up to see what was all the fuss about Ludlum.  I couldn't get through them (I don't even remember which ones they were).  His characters were so overdone as to be unreal, his plots were ridiculously grand scale and the things that happened were like something out of cartoons.

So I decided to read The Bourne Identity after seeing and enjoying the Matt Damon movie.  I approached the book with some skepticism, but was quickly and pleasantly surprised.  Bourne is instantly a sympathetic character, since you meet him after he's been horribly injured, and has no idea who he is or where he came from.  The novel unfolds from there, with Bourne successively learning bits about his past as he realizes he's a trained killing machine.  He has genuine anguish about what he does to the people who are chasing him, and is even more tormented by what he may have done in his past to have these mysterious people trying to kill him.  The love interest he develops is believably handled and tastefully done.  The action scenes are not only exciting but realistic.  This is a great thriller that deserves to be on a short list of classics like Day of the Jackal, Three Days of the Condor, LeCarre's Smiley series and The Hunt for Red October.",1295222400,,1399,4.556

2331143,1,B0009WK5CW,"I have never said this ever about a book - but the movie is far better.

Puffed up, pot boiling trash is probably the best way to describe this - and that's an insult to puffed up, pot boiling trash.  Ludlum should have been ashamed to put his name to it.  How do you take a concept this good and reduce it to so much cow manure?  If I had been asked to hold my breath for the length of time Ludlum asks me to suspend my disbelief I would have suffocated inside the first 10 pages.

I was interested to see whether the trilogy improved the further I got into it so I forced myself through the other two books.  Amazingly he managed to lower the bar with each attempt!  Just when you thought he couldn't write anything worse there was The Bourne Supremacy.  ""Oh well, at least he's bottomed out now, the only way is up"", you start to think.  But no, Ludlum picks up a shovel and digs his way further into the dung heap with The Bourne Ultimatum.

This is time I will never get back - I implore you to avoid reading this rubbish so you don't feel similarly disappointed at the end.

If you want decent spy literature from around the same period, you could try John Le Carre instead.  In fact anything would beat this nonsense.

Just as The Sex Pistols produced The Great Rock and Roll Swindle with Malcolm McLaren, in this book (and indeed the trilogy) Ludlum has produced The Great Spy Novel Swindle.",1293667200,,1399,4.273764258555133
2331144,5,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourn Identity is a pretty good action film.  To give you a brief idea of the storyline- a man wakes up in the ocean (Matt Damon's character) has absolutely NO idea where he is, realizes he doesn't remember anything from the past two weeks prior to the incident, meets an attractive young woman while in the city, and they both spend the entire time running from the police around Germany and France.

While it's a pretty easy plotline to follow, it unfortunately does contain some unsatisfyingly dry and quiet moments that feel really tacked on and unnecessary, dragging the overall score down a few notches.

Also, I was never really sure whether Damon's character had superhero strengths, or whether these devastating moves of his were just your typical far-fetched action segments on the part of the Hollywood directors.  I'm not necessarily complaining about it- just wondering if those power moves he was delivering to the bad guys had an explanation of some sorts, or were we not supposed to acknowledge Damon's amazing power?

Lots of shooting, fighting, and yes, even some romance scenes take up a good portion of The Bourn Identity.  Not a bad film however.",1293580800,,1171,4.888888888888889

In either case, I have just re-read the book and I found it quite exciting in places and a little slow in others. The problem is that the reader gets used to the fast pace of the plot, and then at times when the plot slows down a little, it feels to the reader like time has stopped. This happened during Bourne's flashbacks to his service in Vietnam, as well as the small part of the plot that involved Treadstone agents discussing their strategy for capturing Bourne. The ""love"" angle incorporated into the plot--in which Bourne and Marie become dependent on each other--was a little less than satisfying. The reader knew the couple would fall in love and ultimately be together in the end, so the characters' thoughts and discussions about whether Bourne should forever leave Marie in an effort to ensure her safety got a little old. Enough already! Stop fussing about it Jason, and take her under your wing. There were a couple very mild love scenes and I think these should have been described with a little more enthusiasm. Note to the author: don't bother writing a romance novel!

2331164,5,B0009WK5CW,"Robert Ludlum died in 2001, and for that I am profoundly sorry. It means no more of his superb books will be coming our way. I saw all three Bourne movies before I started reading The Bourne Identity, and I definitely recommend the books over the movies.

The Bourne Identity is reminiscent of Dan Brown's Angels and Demons or The Da Vinci Code, in the way that Ludlum starts you out knowing nothing, then feeds you little tidbits that keep you wanting to read more. My only regret is that I saw the movie first, so I know what happens in the end. I would have loved to read the book and find everything out at a slower pace.

The story starts when a small fishing boat happens upon a man floating in the Mediterranean Sea, near Marseilles, France. The man has been shot multiple times, and when the doctor at a seaside town manages to fix him up, the man remembers nothing. He slowly recuperates, and when several belligerent fishermen attack him, he finds out he has incredible fighting skills. He also has an intimate knowledge of firearms, and his face has been altered by plastic surgery. But he still remembers nothing.

He sets out from the small fishing village after five months of healing, and manages to make it to Marseilles. Following an address implanted in his hip, he goes to Zurich, Switzerland. There, he finds a bank account with his name on it- Jason Charles Bourne. Eventually he gets a set of instructions and substantial information regarding who he was before he lost his memory. But you'll have read the book to find that out.

Jason Bourne is an incredibly well-developed character, with emotions and reactions that one would naturally expect from an amnesiac on the run from assassins. The relationship between Jason and Marie is so believable, Robert Ludlum either put a price on his own head to see what his reactions would be, or has an incredibly vivid imagination. (I don't know about you, but I'm going to go with the latter.) The European locales are bright and easy to see, and his furious action scenes are face-paced and intense.

If you like books by Tom Clancy, Dan Brown, or any good mystery-thriller, I definitely recommend this book to you. It'll satisfy any need you throw at it.",1270857600,,2222,4.643765903307888

2331168,5,B0009WK5CW,"Matt Damon really comes of age with The Bourne Identity.  A James Bond on Steroids like character that seems to have made the Bond series get more intense with the likes of Daniel Craig as Bond.

There is definate passionate action here.  We see a man who is washed out at sea, with amnesia, wondering who he is and why.  Quickly he has an identity, yet too many in the form of multiple passports, and tons of cash, when he goes to a bank vault in Switzerland, that is the only form of information he has on him when he is rescued.  Things go from the darkness of not knowing who you are to a mad rush to escape seeming capture.  Not only that, he has all these amazing skills, martial arts, technical skills, ability to size up things where ever he goes.  What does it all mean?

Additionally, as he escapes from one place where armed US Marines are chasing him, he happens along a young woman who is actually a drifter with no real place to go.  He has money, identification, but who is he, and he has an address, lets go there.  We flash back and forth from Bourne on the run and CIA headquarters, where his handlers are wondering where he had been for weeks, now he is run amok.

Although a very violent movie from the perspective of fighting and shootings, the movie is simply not bloody or full of gore.  So, you can focus on the action and story, not the gore.  Clive Owen plays a very serious focused asset of the CIA. He is like Bourne, trained to kill.  He says very few words, and comes across as rather intense.

Franka Potente does a great job of his unwitting accomplice who gets more and more afraid, yet intrigued as she finds herself a part of international intrigue.

Damon, having played in a variety of less action type roles, really pulls off this one.  He still looks like a kid, yet his acting overrides his youthful look.

The DVD has some great extras, you are taken behind the scenes with interviews of the actors as they do each part of the movie.

2331170,5,B0009WK5CW,"This is my first Robert Ludlum book, and I have to say I enjoyed it a lot. I like this book for several reasons. Firstly, it's interesting. Bourne is a man who's on more than one ""Wanted"" list, and yet he has no idea why. He travels the world searching for the answer to a question that's simple to seemingly anyone but him--who am I?

Secondly, you learn to love the characters. Jason's companion is the witty Marie St. Jacques, a member of the Canadian government who's eager to help him in recovering his memory. And Jason himself is probably the most complex character in the book. When he fights, he hears phrases in his head that he's never heard before--and when he sees a person's face, memories flood his mind. Simply reading, you're experiencing what he's going through. When he's in danger I'm so distressed I have to skip ahead, find out if he's actually okay, and then go back to read what I missed!

Thirdly, it's very well written. At points it gets so amazingly detailed that my head hurts trying to comprehend what the author is describing, but at other times it's very helpful in understanding the story line. The characters are so well described that by the end of the book you feel like you know them, and the plot is completely unpredictable.

I can't think of anything else I didn't like about this book besides from the fact that it's a little too detailed. Its plot is amazing, even though sometimes it's a tad confusing, and definitely can't be copied unless someone got sued...! Robert Ludlum did an amazing job writing this book, and I can hardly wait to read the next one.",1266883200,,1600,4.548611111111111

2331174,1,B0009WK5CW,"I'll be the first to admit that this review is less to do with these specific Bourne movies and more related to the Blu Ray conversion however I feel that one needs to understand the issues with these discs before addressing the movies themselves. Let me cut to the chase, do NOT buy these discs! They will frustrate and annoy you every time you attempt to watch them, allow me to explain.

I have a Samsung Blu Ray player with updated firmware (don't get me started on that process) connected via HDMI cable to Samsung LCDTV, generally Blu Ray discs work fine on this set up, there are occasions when on other discs the movies will pause for a brief second and then continue however these Bourne movies were impossible to watch. To begin with they seem to feature their own unique controls meaning that trying to scan forward or backward would cause the disc to lock and seemingly stall, never did get the movie to scan properly. Then there were the issues with the movie in general, the picture repeatedly froze, in car chases and in Chapter 11 (and multiple points thereafter) while they are sitting talking in the car, the sound was then out of synch with the picture and more freezing and stalling, it was so bad that I ejected the discs and watched the old DVD versions of the movies. Utterly unacceptable, beyond annoying!

As for the movies themselves, what this experiment did show the dramatic improvement of the Blu Ray versions, the picture was much crisper, the colors richer and more saturated and certainly less noise in the picture, also the sounds was much better, more full and dynamic, too bad that the technology rendered the discs unwatchable.
The irony is that I had ""upgraded"" from an HDDVD when that format lost out and I had this movie on HD, there were NO problems, same outstanding picture and the player had none of the issues that I attribute to Blu Ray. For whatever reason I believe that Blu Ray is simply not ready yet, too many glitches, I don't want to have to constantly monitor my firmware to watch a movie! That same kind of updating madness is what got me to migrate from a Windows PC to a Mac!

The bottom line is this, the movies are fantastic! Honestly one of my favorite trilogies and WHEN the disc is working the picture and sound really are phenomenal, the problem is in the ""when"", it is frustrating and unacceptable to deal with these glitches, yes, the movies are being returned to Amazon and a formal letter of complaint is being registered with Universal Home Entertainment. My advice to you, skip these for now or at the very least try to hunt down the regular Blu Ray versions, not these dual discs and save yourself the frustration.",1265155200,,2684,4.575883575883576

When this movie initially came out, I was very reluctant to see it. I had this weird and stupid bias against Matt Damon for whatever reason I can't even remember now, but that's in the past. Once I got wise, though, my very first viewing of this film (as well as the rest of the trilogy) came in the form of their BD releases. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised, especially for this being the first of three parts in an overall story. The film begins with the discovery of a man in the ocean by a group of fishermen; a man with two bullet holes in his back, a Swiss bank account number in his hip, and no memory of who he is. He can fluently speak foreign languages and is apparently a master in firearms and fisticuffs, but still can't remember his name or how he ended up where he did. In reaching the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport. The name inside: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Also in the box are multiple other passports, all with the same picture, but different names. And so, Bourne embarks on a journey to find out who he really is, meeting a gypsy woman named Marie (Franka Potente), in which they face assassins and conspiracy coverups with only each other to depend on.

For me, this movie not only re-defined the spy-thriller genre (James Bond should thank this franchise because I think his recent incarnation was really influenced by it), but it made me a huge fan of Matt Damon. It's a gritty, more realistic, and down-to-earth depiction that relies less on flash and pizazz and tells a very humanistic story. If I were to break it down, I would say the appeal comes from about a third in the writing, a third in the acting, and a third in the score. The writing succeeds a lot in terms of subtlety; it doesn't explain a whole lot, but leaves enough for the audience to understand and empathize Bourne without ever getting ahead of him. This, in turn, is brilliantly performed by Damon who's portrayal is just as subtle as the writing; he's cool, calm, and collected, yet carries a certain degree of violence and ferocity when his training kicks in. And then there's the music; John Powell creates a very engaging score with three particularly crucial elements that, in my opinion, really drive the film: Bourne's main theme (which adds a sense of mystery and intrigue), a lot of percussion pieces (which sound great for action sequences), and the trademark whirring effect (that foreshadows Bourne's time to kick ass). The Bourne Identity is a very well-made spy-thriller that, as director Doug Liman puts it, ""is made with a lot of European sensibilities,"" making this a very refreshing take for the time it was made. Not only does it provide the mystery and action of a spy movie, but the additional cerebral aspect makes it that much more enjoyable. And it only gets better in the sequels.

The Bourne franchise makes its first entry onto high definition with a pretty good transfer. I say ""pretty good,"" which may seem a bit generous considering a couple of gripes I have with it, but all in all, I'd say the pros outweigh the cons. Let's start with the good. General detail and sharpness look great, capturing some excellent scenic shots, revealing a decent amount of line delineation between clothes and objects, and showing some of the finer features on peoples' faces and hair during closeup shots. Colors are vivid, albeit slightly de-saturated, with lots of reds and orange being at the forefront of the spectrum. The red bank bag that Bourne wears around the beginning of the film tends to especially stand out, along with the occasional random red object in the background. The jacket he also wears in the beginning and the one big explosion that the movie has literally explodes orange when it does happen. Skin tones are very lifelike with great variation from person to person and reflect accordingly depending on the lighting of the scene. Black levels aren't super-deep, but do enough to help accentuate the intrigue during darker scenes or nighttime shots. The film also supports a nice, light layer of grain and never gets in the way.

The two bad things? Contrast and damage. Contrast is generally a tad on the low side giving the movie a kind of murky look with even daytime shots looking a little on the dim side. The detail is still good enough, but compared to other movies I've seen with low contrast that still manage to have a pristine picture, this one doesn't really hold up. Throughout the course of the movie, there are also various instances of dirt and even one or two moments where scratches from print damage popped up for a split second. They're not terribly obvious, but they are noticeable. In the end, though, Oliver Wood's photography looks great and really helps to maintain a very earthy, yet exotic look to the cityscapes, indoor sets, and wider-viewed shots. My favorite parts to look at are the snowy streets of Zurich for it's variation in color around the city, the shootout at the farmhouse for its detail, and the nighttime shots around the end of the movie for the blacks.

While the video portion of this disc isn't quite perfect, the audio comes much closer. As I mentioned about the music being an integral part of the film, interestingly enough, the movie opens with the Universal credits, but doesn't play the Universal theme. Instead, it's starts out silent and fades into the sound effects, then into the main title theme of Bourne. General immersion is excellent with the score having a pulse of its own through a lot of the drumming beats and tense string pieces. And then, of course, there's that trademark whirring effect, which when played, really enhances the mood of whatever is acting out on screen. Directionality and separation dominate the sound field when action sequences take precedent, though dialogue thankfully remains clear regardless of how loud a crash, gunshot, or broken window gets.

In particular, I was very pleased with how well-isolated the effects were in the scene where Bourne is fending off the first Treadstone assassin. When the guy breaks in, it was completely quiet beforehand, and then all hell broke loose. But even then, when Bourne and Marie are being pursued by the French police, the car chase sequence does a bit of the opposite by having a very lively mix of automotive chaos and snazzy Euro-techno that almost felt like a scene out of The Transporter. I would say this scene utilizes the rear speakers best with some very aggressive effects as some of the cars come buzzing around tight corners and others start crashing into one another. And then towards the end of the film when Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character, we get a great example of the middle road. It's isolated enough like the first assassination attempt when Bourne blows up a tanker providing some real pounding LFEs, but then it also feels very immersive when he fires another shot and the birds in the field start flying around. To sum it up, The Bourne Identity has a great sound design and mix. The actual sound quality has a lot of depth to it, with both the high and low ends displaying great dynamic range. As a whole, it's not quite reference material, but I would liken that more to the nature of the film itself having a lot of quieter moments. But rest assured, though, that the sequels will definitely fix that right up.

Extras - 4.5

- Audio Commentary (Director Doug Liman)
This is a very informative track with a wealth of information that covers a wide variety of aspects from the writing, casting, filming, set designs, editing, scoring; you name it. Essentially, what I found most interesting were the comments Liman had about the heart of the story and its presentation; namely, how he wanted to bring a sense of grit and realism to the spy-thriller genre, making it a drama, first, and an action film, second. He goes into great detail about the depiction of Bourne and how he and Damon collaborated to make the character feel subtle and empathetic, yet strong and determined throughout the circumstances of the story. In fact, Liman really stressed the parallels between the Kali fighting style that Bourne uses and how its core philosophy of energy conservation and quick, brutal efficiency ties into Bourne's overall demeanor. He later goes on to talk about character motivations and how Damon and Potente did particularly good jobs at humanizing the character of Bourne in such a way that, I feel, had a gradual impact on the look and feel of other modern spy-thrillers succeeding this one (here's looking at you, Bond). Oddly enough, there were a few very large dead spots, but for the most part, when Liman talks, he really lets loose.

- The Ludlum Identity (SD; 12:49)
Tells us a little bit about the famed author of the series, Robert Ludlum, namely, things like: how he made the transition from theater actor to novelist, how he tied those theater experiences into his writing, how a lot of the locales he came up with were inspired by post WWII-Europe, how he saw conspiracy in authority, and finally how he came to adopt the trend of 3-word titles for all of his works (""The [whatever] [whatever]"").

- The Ludlum Supremacy (SD; 12:41)
Talks about the origin of Bourne's name, Ludlum's personality in general and how it was reflected through the character of Bourne, some of the differences between the movie and novel (such as the omission of Carlos the Jackal), how The Bourne Identity boosted his status as an author, and then the eventual progression that was a result from Identity's success.

- The Ludlum Ultimatum (SD; 23:57)
This piece covers a pretty huge chunk of Jason Bourne's story arc between the first and second movie. If you've seen all the films by this point, then it's an excellent breakdown of the character, his motivations, and the themes they wrote into the plot. If by some chance this is your first time seeing Identity, do no watch this feature, as it will contain some major spoilers for Supremacy.

- Alternate Opening and Ending (SD; 10:46 altogether)
Starts with a brief introduction by the 3 guys listed below and mentions how the movie had to be adjusted after the events of 9/11 for the sake of changed sensibilites. They were concerned about the ""datedness"" of the subject material and how it would make audiences react. The alternate opening basically would have turned the whole movie into a flashback and tying up in present day at the end. They say they were pretty happy with the ending you see in the final cut (and so am I).

- Introduction with Producer Frank Marshall, Co-Writer Tony Gilroy, and Actor Brian Cox (3:33)
- Alternate Opening (2:16)
- Alternate Ending (4:56)

- Deleted Scenes (SD; 6:58)
Listed below are the individual scenes:

- Wombosi on the Private Jet (0:59)
- Bourne and Marie by the Side of the Road (2:29)
- Psychologist Discusses Bourne (1:46)
- Bourne and Marie Practice on Subway (1:42)

- Extended Farmhouse Scene (0:58)
Liman actually makes a quick reference to this in the commentary. He said this scene was left in the European version of the film, but then went on to say it was cut from the American version for ""timing reasons."" As if 58 seconds really makes that big of a difference in theater showings per day...

- The Birth of the Bourne Identity (SD; 14:31)
A pretty generic EPK-style feature that tells you how Bourne is different from your average spy-thrill title. It has very badly-edited interviews that are short and whose sporadic nature doesn't really tell you much at all. I recommend you avoid this if you're looking for actual depth and quality.

- The Bourne Mastermind: Robert Ludlum (SD; 5:44)
Mostly recycled information talking about Ludlum's transition from theater to writing. It offers a little more retrospect after the fact, but it's too short and not much more than you can hear about in the other features above.

- Access Granted: An Interview with Co-Writer Tony Gilroy (SD; 4:03)
Talks about the essence of Bourne and how the movies had to be adapted for modern times, as opposed to the Cold War mentality they originally had when it started in the '80s.

- From Identity to Supremacy: Jason & Marie (SD; 3:37)
Some interviews with Damon and Potente about the characters they play, how they interpreted their motivations, and the transition they had to make when filming Supremacy. Damon said that Bourne's actions are what he feels develops the character, while Potente praises how non-clich her character was and how the chemistry between Bourne and Marie is sporadic throughout the relationship.

- The Bourne Diagnosis (SD; 3:25)
Talks about the actual medical condition of the amnesia Bourne suffers in the plot. The psychologist basically says that Bourne suffers from Selective Dissociative Amnesia, but retains a Kinesthetic Memory of how to perform all of his trained skills. He also goes on to point out that the presence of Marie's character was a big help in portraying memory recovery.

- Cloak and Dagger: Covert Ops (SD; 5:31)
An interview with an officer of the CIA who talks about the overt and covert operations they actually do perform and how accurate the depiction of Bourne and all the training technicalities were.

- Inside a Fight Sequence (SD; 4:42)
Shows how the choreography was staged with stunt coordinator Nick Powell.

- Moby ""Extreme Ways"" Music Video (SD; 3:38)
A music video to the ending credits song.

- U-Control
There are 3 different interactive applications you can play along with the film:

- Treadstone Files
A kind of gimmicky computerization that simulates certain parts of the movie to feel like you're looking through a high-tech dossier. It shows a bunch of trivial factoids and statistics about the characters, the locations, Treadstone, and all kinds of other information.

- Bourne Orientation
PiP that plays like Warner Bros.' Maximum Movie Mode where the current scene and an older scene that may or may not contain interviews will split into 2 individual screens of their own and essentially rehash important plot points.

- Picture in Picture
A true PiP application that opens up a little box in the corner of the screen with additional interviews not seen in the special features. Altogether, it equates to about 25 minutes and is divided into 8 chapters of the scene selection. Some of the material covered includes: the action and how Damon wanted to do his own stunts, filming in Paris, Liman casting Damon as Bourne and what it was like working with him, the relationship between Bourne and Marie, a more in-depth analysis of Marie's character, and a short look at the other Treadstone agents through an interview with Clive Owen. It's a little disappointing there aren't more interviews, but it's pretty well-worth the information.

Overall - 4.5

For the starter of the bunch, The Bourne Identity is a very entertaining refresher into, what was then, a faltering spy-thriller genre. This Blu-ray disc looks pretty good with only a couple of minor problems, the sound is fantastic considering there's more drama than action, and the special features are very informative. It's a shame Ludlum never got to see this, but the people that knew and vouched for him are pretty happy with the way it turned out. The Bourne franchise has certainly changed the genre (just look at how Daniel Craig's Bond movies have shaped up) and for the better. If you haven't seen this yet, definitely pick it up, then wait to be amazed by its sequels.",1263945600,,15715,4.777818717759764

2331185,4,B0009WK5CW,"If you have ever read a fantasy novel you know the general idea:

A character or characters is suddenly made aware that they are the key to solving a great problem of their time.
Then they are thrust out into to the world in a strange adventure that they could have barely imagined before.  That is the basic flow of this novel.  However Ludlum manages to keep me on the edge of my seat travelling through europe and delving deeps into the conspiracy.

This is the story of Jason Bourne who wakes up on a fishing boat and is nursed back to health by an alcoholic physician.  Through the healing process they discover that Jason has an implant that references a bank account.  Jason also seems to have an uncanny knack of self defense and/or violence.  It is decided that Jason would go investigate the bank account.  When he does it unleashes an entire government agency to pursue him.  Which agency and why, we have no idea, just that they do not seem to be friendly.  As the book goes on we are introduced to Cain and Carlos.  Two rival executioners.  Cain has is new and been assassinating prominent figures in Asia, while Carlos is the world leader in high level executions, based primarily in Europe.

Through the novel we see Bourne as his memory slowly returns and he is sent from one location to another, chasing Carlos,or Cain, or being chased by the shadowy government agency.

It is a thrilling and exciting spy novel which has almost nothing to do with the Matt Damon movies.  Carlos is the reason for everything in this book and he is not even in the film.  You will enjoy this book more if you tell yourself that the films are called ""The Matt Damon Action Spy Trilogy"" and remove any connections between book and film.  The only similarities are the name and the fact that the main character has amnesia.  That's about it.

I might have been more interested in this book if I didn't realize that Bourne doesn't get killed. Also, there are 3 or four more books written by Ludlum that revolve around Bourne. I found this theme to be already used by many other authors. Maybe Ludlum was the first to use it or i just read some others that seemed to be better. I am fond of Detective novel & murder mysteries.

2331191,1,B0009WK5CW,"After reading the book, I've got to commend Hollywood for taking a totally lame piece of material and making it good on the screen.  The book is utterly unbelievable -- Jason Bourne is rendered into an utter wimp, girlfriend Marie's attraction to him makes NO SENSE AT ALL (and she is just plain annoying in the book!).  Further, Jason's success pivots on people who do the unbelievable -- taxi drivers who obey his very unusual orders without second thought, spy enemies who are all too willing to spill their beans for no apparent reason, an ultra top secret hideout that is penetrated by a group of guys posing as movers, completely lame.

Frankly, if I didn't like the Bourne movies, I would never have made it through the book.  I'm reading the Bourne Supremacy with the hope that Ludlum can redeem himself (about 100 pages in, it's not looking so good).  If the 2nd is no better than the 1st, then the whole thing goes down in flames in my book.

Anyone who has read Tom Clancy will be in for a huge disappointment with Ludlum.

2331192,2,B0009WK5CW,"""The Bourne Identity"" by Robert Ludlum.

1975, The Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Port Noir; Fishermen find a man that appears to be dead floating in the sea. After extricating the body from the water they realize that though bullet ridden the man is still alive. With nowhere to turn the fishermen deliver the man to a drunkard of a Doctor in Port Noir who might attempt to bring this man back from death's clutch. Dr. Washburn quickly determines that his recovering patient is no normal man. The patient is struggling with almost total amnesia. There is evidence of plastic surgery having been completed and the small microfilm has been implanted in his hip with the name of a bank and an account number on it. 5 to 6 months pass on Port Noir and the un-named man decides to pursue his only clue which must reside in the account that was on the hidden micro film...

There are very few book to movie translations in which the successor surpasses it's predecessor. Unfortunately for me The Bourne Identity is one of those cases. The movie is actually only vaguely similar to the book and moves in almost a completely different direction with greater success I might add. Do not make the mistake I did in thinking that since you enjoyed the movie you are apt to enjoy the book even more. The only thing to be found down that path of reasoning is disappointment.

The Good: The book has a few moments though I am having trouble recalling any of them currently. It suffices to say that for me the bad far out weighed the good.

The Bad: One of the biggest problems I had with the book was the numerous annoying writing habits of Mr. Ludlum. I'll give you a warm up: Get Carlos. Trap Carlo. Cain is for Charlie and Delta is for Cain. You are going to read that line a maddening number of times. Also be sure to brush up on your French because Mr. Ludlum has no problem throwing some French into the mix.

The Marie Character and her relationship with Bourne lacks any sense of believability. The move version was well thought out and worked, the book version, Not so much. For starters the character is PHD who is employed by the Canadian government. A woman who you would expect to be intelligent and interested in self preservation. Not someone who falls into a puppy love type state with someone who was just recently smacking her in the face, kidnapping her and holding her at gun point. In a matter of days after a very traumatic introduction the Marie character is so in love that she can't bear to be parted from Jason and is constantly referring to him as ""My love"" or ""My darling"" or a variation thereof. It is not believable in the least. There is so much time spent in hotel rooms where the Marie character is consoling poor Jason and trying to convince him he isn't who he believes he is even though she has almost no reason to belive it herself all the while calling him my darling etc. Very painful reading.

The plot is also spread a little too far and eventually becomes convoluted. This combined with unbelievable characters makes for an extremely tedious read.

Overall: Avoid this at all cost. If you have a Bourne craving you are better off stopping at Blockbuster.",1250121600,,3186,4.511265164644714
2331193,3,B0009WK5CW,The movie version is known for its lightning paced action and the novel version couldn't be further from the truth.  Its not bad but there was at times information overload and the repetition in Bourne's inner monologue became tiresome.  Ludlum's ideas here are really good but the execution lacked at times.

2331196,4,B0009WK5CW,"This is an action thriller that is great from start to finish.

A man is rescued at sea.  He has no memory of who he is or anything about him.  He ends up being in some very tight spots and demonstrates that he has a wide variety of impressive fighting skills.

In his quest to figure out who he is, he connects with a young German woman, Marie (Franka Potente) who assists him throughout much of the show.  As it goes along, he (Matt Damon) discovers that his name, or one of them, is Jason Bourne.  It turns out that he is a CIA assassin.  While he has amnesia, his employers think that he has gone rogue and are attempting to kill him.

All of this makes for a story with lots of action.  The events take place all across Europe.  It is really a very entertaining film that is a good one for any fan of action flicks.",1245024000,,820,4.10062893081761
2331197,3,B0009WK5CW,"I finally watched this movie on DVD and frankly, I don't see what all the hype and fuss was about when this movie was in theaters.

The movie,basically, is about Jason Bourne, apparently a government assassin, trying to find out his true identity. There were several things in the movie that I think left it disjointed and rather confusing. Throughout the movie a government program known is Treadstone is referenced. It's hinted that Bourne is part of this program, but even in the end it's never truly explained what this program is, or how Bourne is a part of it. Julia Stiles role in this movie also is never explained at all. She's just in it heading up some sort of listening post in Paris. I also did not like how this movie was filmed. The camera movements are simply annoying at times and I don't think add to the movie at all.

It's rather obvious, in my opinion, this movie was planned as a trilogy from the beginning and I don't like movies that ""set me up"" in order to make me come back to watch a second movie to find out things that should have been explained in the first one and in my opinion, that's just what this movie is doing.

I also did not think this movie was all that suspenseful or really was a very good thriller. If the filmmakers had taken care to fill in some details so I didn't have questions throughout the movie I might have been able to get into it more.

Perhaps I'll like the trilogy once I watch the other two movies, but as a stand alone movie The Bourne Identity just didn't impress me very much.",1244332800,,1538,4.329861111111111
2331198,3,B0009WK5CW,"if your a big fan of the movie, don't buy the book. the story is very different from the movie script, and also the bourne character in the book is pretty dumb. the bourne we're used to won't appear in the book.",1243900800,,211,4.0476190476190474

2331200,4,B0009WK5CW,"It may be Mat Damon himself.  Surely the leading man in a film of this kind is important, but at first glance, Damon has none of the obvious traits.  He isn't killer handsome.  Neither has he the body of a circus ariealist.  What he's got, it seems to me, is the ability to remind you of a younger brother who enlisted in the Navy and somehow wound up in the Seals.  Nobody had any idea.  One minute he's the hot-shot of the High School Baseball team, the next minute you're watching him get decorated dressed in whites.  You're so proud of him, even if you don't know what it is he does, precisely, and all your family loves him.

So, as I say, no International Lounge Lizard with nouveau riche tastes, or a necklace of Euro-Trash beauties around his neck.

But, when the movie begins and they haul him out of the sea, nearly dead, you see it.  And as he recovers from his wounds, it becomes clearer.  He's one of the brightest and the best; clean as a whistle, sharp as a tack.  Dad's favorite boy, memory clouded, somehow, and on a mission even he doesn't remember.  And whithout making any judgment about it, you've got a great deal invested in him; in seeming him safe and his enemies identified and routed.  Therefore, when the action begins, and it does immediately, one watches him negotiate the thorny mazes of predicaments of incredible complexity and menace, with ingenuity and dispatch.  One of the best demonhstrations of what he can do happens when he arrives in Paris, after getting his money and passports out of a Swiss bank.  ANd himself and a German girl of some sort with a car, out of the American Embassy trap.  Well, an assassion crashes into his Paris apartment before either of them can catch a breath, and there's a life and death flght which ends when the failed assassin thorws himself out of the window and dies on the sidewalk below.  That is the prelude to as brilliant and harrowing a demonstration of trick driving as I've ever seen, as Borne and the girl drive her Cooper Mini through the mazes and tangles of fast, congested Parisian traffic, followed by police cruisers and motorcycle mounted cops.  Thrilling!  And that's just the first third of the film.

Rather than describe the remainder of the story in detail, I will say, instead, that the director does not allow the project to make any fatal mistakes.  He doesn't flirt with us; doesn't try to seduce us into liking the movie with mugging or stupid action jokes.  He doesn't use kids that way.  Or animals.  Or any people.  There are no faux literary pretensions anywhere.  Although there are people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in the film, there's no ethnic or racial humor.  There are no shameful and insincere attempts to conjure up a facile moral to the story by juggling religioius symbols.  The sexual attraction of the hero and heroine to one another isn't either lewd or tricky, but grows inevitably out of the inter-reliance that builds between them as they cling to life and avoid discovery.  What attracts her is his freshness, frankness, fearlessness and his determination to protect her from enemies that are really his alone.  Their care for each other becomes as artless and as inevitable as sunrise.

The sound track is good and the intercut POP music is as one would expect it, but the music is never distracting.

Seems to me I've watched this show 3 times now, and it looks better and better every time.  The complex entity that IDENTITY is has been handled with such deftness and skill that no shot or sequence appears to have been derived from any shot or sequence in any other film.  And the editing is flawless.  Flawless!",1243296000,,3655,4.629860031104199

 Jason Bourne is a man who can't remember who he is or where he's been.  He seems to have much reconstructive surgery all over his body and has the ability to speak in many different languages and engage in various forms of combat, though he has no clue why.
 His journey leads him through uncovering conspiracy all the while discovering who he might be.  It is an exciting read and I found myself unable to put the book down.
 If you enjoyed the movie you will definitely love the book even though it is vastly different and somewhat dated (1980).

In the movie, he is given the diagnosis of selective dissociative amnesia...What they did is, they had him forget who he was but they allowed him to continue to remember all the training and the things that he learned over time...

Damon's character, Jason, has been trained in self-defense, weapons handling, high-speed driving, disguise, and secret writing communications... He knows that he's very attentive, and very observant...I really enjoyed the scene in the diner when Jason is telling Marie he doesn't know who he is but he knows that he can name the license plates of all six cars outside, and the clothing that people were wearing...

Marie's character is very helpful to Bourne's character... Based on his unconscious clash of feelings and what he was doing, and being a killer he would've made strenuous efforts to create a new identity if he didn't have a penchant for love...And it was his development and his journey into finding the power to feel that was a big part of this movie...

Jason and Marie's love is a not a classic love...It's definitely a relation of two people who walk next to each other, interact and cross only several times but not all the time...Jason is definitely taken by her, by her forcefulness and her vigor as she's very much alive where he isn't, where he feels lacking any strong emotion... At that point he was still struggling to try to get his memory back...

When you see the sequel or the two parts together, it makes sense because evidently Jason is still haunted... He still has nightmares from things he'd endured... While on the contrary, Marie probably is more the active force trying to set up a home for them...He's definitely the one who still feels on the run because he still is under constant restraint...",1231200000,,1895,4.839506172839506

Nobody's better than Paul Greengrass (director of the sequels) at doin the realer than real life thing, but Bourne Identity is the first and has the most engrossing story to tell.

This movie is loosely based on the 1980 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum (1927 to 2001).

Do you like action-packed mystery-thrillers?  If you do, then this movie is a must-see.

The viewer along with the main character in this movie, later revealed to be Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), suffers from amnesia, not knowing his own identity (thus the movie's title) or anything about his past.  As the movie progresses, both the viewer and Bourne discover one major thing: he posses a lethal survival skill-set that's light years above that of the average Joe.  The other things Bourne discovers about himself make him unhappy with him, at one point saying:

""Everything I find out [about myself], I want to forget.""

Once the viewer discovers that the premise of this entire movie is about discovering identity, then it can only hold the viewer's attention in one way: through action.  It is on this that the movie delivers especially with respect to incredible fight sequences.  One character summarizes the majority of the movie when he says that Bourne leaves a

""trail of collateral damage from Zurich to Paris.""

It is at the movie's end that all is revealed.

Matt Damon as Jason Bourne effectively carries the entire movie.  If not for his fine performance, I think this movie would have probably been a flop.  I also found that the background music and sometimes gritty photography to be impressive.

This movie spawned two sequels: ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007).

The only problem with this movie is that the idea of Bourne constantly trying to discover his identity can become tedious.  True, the action sequences attempt to take away from this tedium but I found myself getting a bit restless as the movie proceeded.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are many extras including an alternate ending.

In conclusion, this movie introduces us to a new action hero and his name is Jason Bourne!!

Carlos - Jason Bourne's nemesis, his equal.

I mean, come on--it's got almost every one of my favorite things: a spy story, action/adventure, amnesia, a romance--heck, the romantic interest is even German. What baffles me is that I'd never read Ludlum's book even though it came out at a time when I was reading a lot of spy novels. I've ordered it.

At any rate, I can't say yet how the movie compares to the book, but the movie is excellent. Matt Damon plays a man who doesn't realize he's a professional assassin perfectly--the combination of good-intentioned searching for his identity with the growing realization that he's not just some nice guy who works in an office is very convincing.

Franka Potente, too, is very realistic as an adventurous young woman who ends up in over her head, but is reluctant to leave because of her growing feelings for him.

The action is nonstop and exciting, and the mystery of who he is and why people are trying to kill him is compelling.

This is one of those rare movies I can watch over and over again. One of my favorites.",1213401600,,1382,4.534136546184739

2331232,5,B0009WK5CW,"2002's ""The Bourne Identity"" is an absolutely thrilling (if loose) adaption of Robert Ludlum's 1980 spy novel.  Its cinematic success has launched two equally thrilling sequels to date, featuring Matt Damon as former CIA assassin Jason Bourne.

A young man in a wet suit, with two bullet holes in his back, is rescued by the crew of a fishing boat in the Mediterranean Sea.  The young man recovers aboard the vessel, but has no memory of who he is or how he came to be in the water.  His only clue is the number of a Swiss bank account implanted in a metal tube in his hip.

The man travels to Zurich and reaches the bank.  His account number provides him access to a safety deposit box, filled with a variety of foreign currencies, a small pile of passports, and a handgun.  The top passport is an American one, in the name of Jason Bourne, with an address in Paris.  The young man goes to the American Embassy in Zurich, where the staff unexpectedly tries to apprehend him and the young man unexpectedly displays astonishing fighting skills in escaping the Embassy.

Outside the Embassy, Bourne bribes a rootless young German female named Marie (played with subtle depth by Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris.  Along the way, the two will bond over the mystery of Bourne's identity.  The mystery will deepen in Paris as Bourne realized he is the target of a murderous agency effort to clean up a mistake and as he realizes that keeping Marie alive is now a personal misssion.

""The Bourne Identity"" features fast-moving, almost breathless action, lots of spy high-tech and technique, and enough convoluted mystery for at least three movies (and counting).  Matt Damon nicely underplays Bourne as a confused but driven man, aware that the clock is ticking in a game he doesn't fully understand.  The movie narrative proceeds on parallel tracks, as Bourne flees across France, while his nominal CIA boss (played with understated urgency by Chris Cooper) and another CIA chieftain (played with sweaty near-panic by Brian Cox) throw both CIA operatives and law enforcement in his path.  Clive Owen has a nice cameo as another CIA assassin; Julia Stiles is introduced in her recurring role as a Paris operative.  The climax of the movie is Bourne's dramatic entrance into a CIA safe house in Paris, there to learn the truth about his identity.

""The Bourne Identity"" is very highly recommended as the thrilling introduction to the Bourne series.  The Extended Edition features a new beginning and ending to the movie designed to the events of 9/11, which somewhat pre-empted the Cold War context of the movie.  This DVD version also features some nice extras on the making of the movie.",1211673600,,2686,4.787418655097614
2331233,3,B0009WK5CW,"A great introduction to the series. I liked going in not knowing how the plot would turn out. I also liked how Bourne was much more vulnerable and less all-powerful at this point. Not unlike Neo (Keanu Reeves) in the first Matrix movie. Although I must say the damsel constantly in distress started to wear thin on me.

Also look for Clive Owen barely recognizable as himself.",1211241600,,376,4.611940298507463
2331234,5,B0009WK5CW,"I don't have time to review this exhaustively, but want to be as thorough as I can.  I'm also working under the assumption that you are interested in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" as well as this, the first movie in one of the best trilogies ever made.  Opinions as to which movie is the best are well within the limits of personal taste; for me, this movie is the second best behind ""The Bourne Ultimatum""; however, like the Beethoven symphonies, one of a great set has to be the least.

TBI starts in the middle of the sea; the Mediterranean, we find out soon enough.  An Italian fishing boat finds a body left for dead in the middle of the night.  The ship's surgeon is skilled and equipped sufficiently to remove some bullets and, in the process, fish out a diode that blinks what appears to be a Swiss bank number.  The man, an American (Matt Damon, of course) regains consciousness, realizing that for the time being, he is among friends.  He is able to remember how to speak, dress, play chess, read, and other daily skills, but has no idea how he ended up in the Mediterranean, much less shot, wearing a wetsuit, or anything else; he cannot even remember his name.  Eventually, the fishermen leave him ashore with a small stipend to get to the Swiss bank, where the man finally learns what his name must have been -- Jason Bourne -- but not much help with who he is, except that he has a ton of cash, a portfolio of fake passports, and a gun.  Except for the gun, he takes the treasure on his journey to find out more about Jason Bourne, no longer able to find buddies like the fishermen -- the Swiss police and the American Embassy security are both interested in detaining him, if not worse.  His last friend is Maria, who gives him a ride to Paris for $10,000 so he can  put together clues from his last known address.  Meanwhile, some American federal agency (CIA? FBI? NSA? the issue doesn't press front and center) is trying to fix something that went wrong with Bourne.  By ""fix"", we get the idea that keeping Bourne alive is not a high priority with the feds.

TBI was the only Bourne movie directed by Doug Liman, rather than Paul Greengrass.  So we don't have the latter's hand-held camera sequences, and that's good and bad.  The hand to hand combat scenes are a little less intense, but easier to watch.  The car chase in Paris is top-notch.

My favorite part about TBI, and the other Bourne movies (or this new species of action movies, in general), is the dichotomy between the policy wonks, surrounded by their computer geeks in monitor-loaded command centers capable of generating impossible intelligence (apparently every intersection in Europe is now covered by a remote camera, no matter how remote) and the rubber-hits-the-road robot assassins, each receiving his assignments by way of a video cell-phone that was probably a bit hipper in 2002 than I'm remembering.  For me, TBI belongs to Conklin (Chris Cooper), Bourne's trainer and supervisor, and apparently the one with the most to lose now that Jason is making noise all over Europe.  He reports to another fine spook, Abbott (Brian Cox), but Conklin just gets me with his short-sleeve dress shirts and ties that make him look like an aluminum-siding salesman.  I got the idea Conklin never did grasp the depth of the hole he'd fallen into, especially when he told Abbott ""We will burn for this,"" and Abbott has an expression on his face like Tonto thinking ""Whaddya you mean we, Kimosabe?""

Besides Abbott and Costello (I mean Conklin), there are some other good supporting performances, with not a lot of lines, from the other assassins.  Of course, we know none of them can be as good as Jason, but cleaning up Jason involves some messy work.  The best of a good group is Clive Owen as the ""professor""; probably his last role this small, he foreshadows questions Jason will ask in the future movies.  But the best other character is Maria (Franka Potente), whose action chops can't be doubted by anyone who's seen ""Run Lola Run"".  Her instinct to trust Bourne when her life depends on it is spot-on, and when you see her buckle up her seat-belt, you might want to make sure your own doors are locked.

The Bourne Identity is a slick, solid, well-written action flick, and is great both standing on its own and as the first movie of a great trilogy.",1210118400,,4355,4.607512953367876

Meanwhile, Matt Damon (as Jason Bourne) has no clue what is going on. All he knows is that people are trying to assassinate him. Towards the middle of the movie it became very intense. Bourne's agency sent out three agents to kill Bourne. At this point Bourne must combat these guys. Each guy is fought in a different way, separating this movie from the typical action movie. The first agent is fought through a stealth type mission out in an open field. Both agents crawl around the field, unaware where each other is. It seemed like Metal Gear to me. Next he fights another agent through a hand to hand combat followed by a straight shoot out.

This movie is a combination of action and drama. It is not a non-stop action thriller but yet is sure to keep your interest because you don't know what is going to happen next.",1208217600,,962,4.435028248587571

I am late getting on the ""Bourne"" bandwagon. I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the ""Bourne"" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received.

""The Bourne Identity"" manages to take a story with a myriad of cliches (the super spy, the spy with amnesia, secret government experiments and cover-ups, etc, etc, etc) and still make a film that's fresh, exciting, intelligent and engrossing.

So the question is, why does this film excel when so many other action films fall flat? First, the film utilizes an excellent cast. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is the thinking man's action hero, bringing a complexity to the role that flies in the face of the typical cocky, wisecracking American action hero. Veteran actors like Chris Cooper and Brian Cox bring gravitas to their supporting roles, and Franka Potente brings an international, quirky sex appeal to her role as Jason's love interest.

As great as the performers are, the script and direction also really deliver. Although the action scenes are all wonderfully executed, the film makes sure not to sacrifice character development either. Jason Bourne is a man who has lost his identity, and as a result is able to regain the humanity he has clearly lost in his previous life as an assassin.",1205193600,,1370,4.866952789699571
2331241,5,B0009WK5CW,"For some long-forgotten reason, I picked up this book while in graduate school, and was immediately hooked on the spy genre (especially after reading Ken Follett's equally good 'Triple').  Since I was working my way through school with a night job, my hours were precious and I already had an ample supply of reading material, yet I found myself unable to put down this book.  The pacing, style (only Chricton ranks as high as a page-turner in my mind), and overall story line make this a classic.  Be careful, you'll need to find the time to finish the trilogy.
The only sad part of this is viewers of the movie series will pick this up and be disappointed in how different the storyline ends.  The literary antagonist (the infamous Jackal) is a much more compelling villain, but I understand the need to keep things up to date in a movie.
I managed to finish school, but he sure made it a bigger challenge.
Overall, well worth the investment of time.  Is anyone else doing it as well these days?  I haven't found him/her yet.",1204761600,,1027,4.554347826086956

First it's a revolver, then a paragraph or two later it's an automatic, then it's a revolver again, all describing the same gun!  Even worse, one of the bad guys is described as carrying a long-barreled revolver with a silencer.  Anyone at all familiar with firearms knows that you can not silence a revolver!  For those not in the know, a tremendous amount of blast and noise escapes from around the cylinder gaps.  Can't silence that.

2331250,4,B0009WK5CW,"As many of you probably already know, The Bourne Identity is the first of the three installments of the Bourne film trilogy. It is loosely based on the Novel by Robert Ludlum of the same name. I had already watched this film long before I realized that it was based on a novel and that there were actually three total books involving the Bourne character, all of which would soon have their own film adaptations. With all of that said, I was initially surprised on how good this film really was. I had my doubts that Matt Damon would be able to pull off a character like Jason Bourne. For some reason, Matt Damon just doesn't come to my mind when you think action star, but he really pulled it off here. Not only Damon, but the supporting cast is good as well, with Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, and Julia Styles all having good performances. But what I loved about this movie was the pacing. This film has very few slow parts in it, but yet it isn't just all over-the-top action either. There's a very good balance to the film. And during the more action-packed sequences, it isn't just senseless action for the sake of action, there's a purpose behind it. The main reason for this is simply because this a good story, and it keeps the audience entertained. There's more than just one storyline happening throughout the film as you get to follow the Jason Bourne character as he tries to find out just who he really is. I really don't have many negative things to say about this film. The only thing I would change would be the last action sequence in the film involving the Bourne character jumping off a staircase and shooting someone. I really thought that was completely unrealistic. Another thing that has really nothing to do with the movie, it's about the packaging of this DVD. This is supposed the the Extended Edition with a bunch of special features. But in reality, there's not a lot of difference in this edition and the regular one. There's a few more little featurettes and an alternate beginning and ending (which I didn't care too much for), and a few little other things, but nothing real special. Heck, this isn't even a 2-disc DVD! So, if you already have this movie and not this edition, then you're not missing much.

2331256,5,B0009WK5CW,"No doubt many will read this (and the other Bourne books) because they've enjoyed the movie(s).  As with the films, this book is incredibly intense, complicated and action packed.  But it's far more than a potential screenplay.  The stories bear almost no comparison at all, the films being only loosely based on the general (brilliant) concept and main character ... and of course the dramatic opening scene of this book.

The writer creates atmosphere perfectly.  Where his passages are descriptive (of environment, emotion or event), he keeps it taut and relevant - enhancing without weighing down the progress of the narrative.

The action scenes are visceral, super-fast and, at times, brutal.  Often coldly efficient and compact, as I imagine would be the case in the incredible urgency of a desperate, adrenalin fired battle to the death.  Our hero acts on instinct, using his intrinsic skills, and is often confused by and even fearful of his extraordinary abilities.

The dialogue is precise and constructed in a way that feels real - although quite stiff and dated at times.  This doesn't obstruct enjoyment of the book however and was probably right for the time it was written.  There's an awful lot of ""My darling"" and ""My true love"" between Bourne and Marie (pretty much replaced by ""babe"" and ""hun"" now!)

One point that I was curious about: on three occasions the same unusual phrase popped up from sources of completely different background.  `Spoors in the forest' is used by a high class Paris fashion house owner, then a thirty year American CIA veteran, then Bourne himself.  Surely such different people would have different phrases to express ... well, whatever spoors in the forest means!

We're often in Bourne's head.  Listening to his thoughts and internal desperate battles keeps us most definitely on his side and is a good contrast to the external action of the unfolding story.

Perhaps Marie is just a little TOO cool in this crisis.  As she goes from economics genius, very much grounded in the sedate academic world of economics and politics to courageously dealing with brutal international assassins, covert government teams (it seems everyone on the planet is after Bourne), gun fights, rapists and kidnappers, as well as cleaning out bullet wounds.  And all in a beautiful red silk dress and high heels.

It's a story of many layers and depths and hidden corners.  It races ahead ... and around, and back, and across, and ahead ... at dizzying speeds.  Is he good? Is he bad?  Which side is he on? How many sides are there?  Who is he?

It's very exciting.  I've no idea how much of it is feasible but who cares!  Read and take note of every word because if you don't you might miss a vital clue!",1198972800,,2734,4.836206896551724
2331257,5,B0009WK5CW,"Like the title of my review says, the first Bourne movie is still the best, at least as far as the film itself goes. I did enjoy the final film in the trilogy quite a bit (especially when compared to the second movie) but the first film is still the most fun and the most impactful. With a story like the one surrounding the ill-fated Jason Bourne, it's tough to top the character's journey in this first movie, where he slowly discovers what he can do, what he is and finally who he is.

The movie tells the story of one Jason Bourne, found floating in the middle of the ocean with an pretty basic case of amnesia. After being dropped off in Europe, he discovers he has skills and abilities that no normal person should have. With the help of a woman whom he offers $20,000 to drive him to Paris, Bourne slowly uncovers clues to his past while being chased by CIA operatives and several black ops agents with skills similar to his.

The high-definition transfer of this fast-paced thriller is pretty darn good. It's not a pristine reference-quality disc, but it's not very easy to find HD movies that look a whole lot better than this one. The level of detail is high, the film lacks overt amounts of graininess, and there is nary a sign of compression artifacts to distract from one's enjoyment of the action unfolding. It's one of the better HD movies I've had the pleasure of watching. I have no trouble recommending a purchase.",1198627200,,1432,4.482758620689655
2331258,4,B0009WK5CW,"Matt Damon is Jason Bourne - an agent of the U.S. government who has lost his memory, yet retains a great deal of intelligence and martial arts skills.  The CIA believes he has failed a mission he was sent to accomplish in Europe.  When they learn he is alive, they quickly use a league of agents to hunt down Bourne before time runs out on the clock, and the men involved with the screw up get in real trouble.  The plot gets very detailed throughout the film, but this is the basic idea.

Though there are some nice fight scenes and a great car chase in the film, the plot is always moving along, so there is little need for an abundance of action to keep things rolling.  I love films like this, cause when there is action, it actually holds some meaning when it occurs.  Bourne and the woman he accompanies (who the CIA is also after) share a great chemistry - both as characters and as actors.  The remainder of the cast is solid, and includes stars such as Julia Styles and Clive Owen - both who actually player lesser characters in the film, though nice to see.

Best thing about this film is the non-stop running of Bourne.  He rarely gets time to stop for a breather, therefore making this film a very easy one for the viewer to stay alert to.  There is a detailed plot that takes a lot to follow every step of what's going on, but it is just as easy to watch if you prefer to sit back and enjoy the ride.

Compared to James Bond in a sense, Bourne actually feels much more realistic.  While Bond is more fun and action packed in the long run, Bourne gives us a greater taste of reality.

The connection to Les Classiques, the general, and the final scene were choppy to say the least. What started out as a very strong premise turned out to be medicore.

The above was said by Marie St. Jacques, Bourne's love interest throughout the novel, and illustrates Ludlum's total tone deafness in writing dialog.  A woman would have said: ""if she's nearly lost her life...her life saved by someone else.""  It's actually much worse than that.  Ludlum writes the entire novel in a single voice, usually that of a third person speaking inside Bourne's head, but even the dialog sounds like that third person's voice.

I finished the novel, even though I started to throw it in the trash several times, just to find out how it turned out.  It didn't.  Nothing was resolved.

For the trivia types out there, Ludlum writes enough like a British writer, E. C. Tubb, that I thought they were the same person until I confirmed otherwise.",1197417600,,986,4.588571428571429
2331262,3,B0009WK5CW,"First, the good news.  Matt Damon makes a great Bourne, even better than Richard Chamberlain, whom I really liked in the prior version.

The bad news is the departures from the book.  I suppose I could get past the stock ""CIA-assassination-team"" theme, but what I can't get over is the way they turned Bourne from a good guy who lost his memory into a bad guy who lost his memory.  Ludlum (or his family agent) was executive producer, so there's no excuse.  Shame on them for doing that.  Actually, shame on them for underutilizing Julia Stiles too.",1197331200,,549,4.608247422680412

2331266,3,B0009WK5CW,"One of the frustrations I have over thrillers is the lack of interesting and convincing characters as well as character interactions that don't sound like talking heads.  Ludlum, in creating Bourne certainly has a lot of that going on, but he also has one of the most complex, riveting and compelling plot lines with enough twists and turns to practically overcome any weaknesses.
  We first find Bourne off the coast of France, as is displayed in both the TV movie and the motion picture with Matt Damon.  He is alone, confused, suffering from total memory loss and having nowhere to go.  Sounds like the movies right?  Sure it does until you tear through the next 400 pages and realize the plot here is infinitely more complex and engaging.  Bourne is a complex character -- and the only one.  He soon meets up with his girlfriend (through a kidnapping of all things) along with a host of players that add to the mystery and confusion.
  You have to pay attention to this novel. Every page is trickling information out at you and some are easy to miss.  A character simply called the old-man who communicates with Carlos is revealed how he got that information towards the end of the book but it is a bit subtle if you're not paying attention.  Along the way there are lots of talking heads mainly from US officals who would put a snore on anyone's lips.  Ludlum uses them to advance the plot more than anything else.
  Is this book flawed -- you bet?  Does it require a bit of suspension of disbelief -- absolutely, the coincidences and character connections are at times hard to buy into.  Is it a cliff hanger -- yes! Is it worth it -- oh ya.  I read it during my days in bed with a nasty, nasty cold.  It took me three days to crank it out.  It holds you tightly because you have to see how it ends.",1196208000,,1805,4.412121212121212
2331267,3,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne Identity is a spy thriller that tells the story of an amnesiac on a quest to learn about his past while staying ahead of those intent on killing him.  The story of his life and the intrigue surrounding it are both unraveled slowly throughout the book.  The story takes many twists and turns, but I won't reveal them here.  Ludlum intentionally put readers almost on par with Bourne in terms of information.  He obviously wanted readers guessing and trying to figure out the truth at the same time the protagonist was.

This novel's greatest strength is the suspense and action of the story.  Ludlum creates a very dangerous world and seemingly all of it is devoted to tracking and killing our hero.  Readers can't help but be anxious for nearly the entire book as each page reveals some new plot or treachery to trap Bourne.

The book's biggest weakness is undoubtedly dialogue and characterization.  All of the characters seem pretty cardboard including Bourne.  When Marie says things like, ""Darling, oh my darling!"" I find myself wondering who Ludlum knew in his life that actually talked that way.  Most of her lines sound like they were copied down from old melodramas on the late, late show.

At its best, this book is a high-octane thriller.  At it's worst it's talky with stilted conversations and not terribly interesting characters.  For much of the book, I labored to get through it, but the last hundred pages or so definitely had me hooked.  This was my first experience reading Robert Ludlum and I'm not at all sure that I'll read any more of his work.  The Bourne Identity is not a bad novel, but it was far from great.  I'd recommend it to Ludlum fans but others might want to look elsewhere.",1195430400,,1719,4.676666666666667

2331271,5,B0009WK5CW,"Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity, is the explosive beginning to the Bourne Series. It is a great book to read for all people; young adult to adult.  ""Two abrupt explosions pierced the sounds of the sea....  A man lunged out of the door grasping the railing with one hand, holding his stomach with the other.  A second man followed....  The man at the railing whipped both his hands up to his head, arching backward under the impact of the fourth bullet"" (7).  Within the first paragraph of chapter one we are introduced to so much imagery and action.

A classic page-turner is just one way of describing this book that follows the journey of one man to self-discovery.  This unknown man is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Port Noir, France by two fishermen where he'd been dumped after being shot.  For three weeks he is slowly nursed back to health by a drunken English doctor who finds a thin strip of microfilm imbedded under the flesh of his hip leading him to a bank in Zurich, Switzerland.  Armed with an address, a bank account number, no name and no memory, he travels to Zurich and he leaves with $4 million dollars and a name, Jason Bourne, his first link to his former life.  As he continues along his journey he's confronted by memories, enemies and seemingly close old friends that he may or may not be able to trust.  Throughout the story Ludlum employs imagery, characterization and a representation of reality to appeal to and engage the everyday reader.

Imagery
All throughout the novel Ludlum utilizes imagery, giving picture-perfect descriptions of locations that allow the reader to be transported into the book, to feel the cold of the sea, to taste the salty air of the Mediterranean, and to hear the busy streets of Paris.  ""The waves rose to goliathan heights, crashing into the hull with the power of raw tonnage; the white sprays caught in the night sky cascaded downward over the deck under the force of the night wind"" (7).  You can see waves in the storm and feel their power.  ""The rue Sarrasin was no more than two hundred feet long, frozen in time between the stone walls of waterfront buildings, devoid of streetlights, trapping the mists that rolled off the harbor"" (41).  The darkness surrounds you and you can visualize where you are.  ""He knew the lobby; the heavy, dark, polished wood was familiar... somehow.  And the huge plateglass window that looked out over Lake Zrich"" (48).  The bank becomes a real place that we can visualize going into through Ludlum's description.  ""And there were other sounds - three - lethal, sharp, sudden.  Cracks of muted weapon - weapons; wood splintered on the molding of the proscenium arch"" (73).  Without explicitly stating that a gun was fired at them, Ludlum, through description carries the point across.

Characterization
Ludlum also makes use of characterization to let the reader connect to the characters and feel for them.  ""The languages, your knowledge of geography - cities I've never or barely heard of - your obsession for avoiding the use of names, names you want to say but won't"" (16).  This is our first look at Bourne before we know his name or anything about him.  He doesn't know why he knows these things and neither do we but we all want to discover the answer.  We grow with Bourne as he goes from a semi-one dimensional to a multi-dimensional character.  Bourne intuitively gives the name of a hotel to his cab driver.  The clerk at the hotel recognizes him and helps him fill out his check in sheet giving him his name.  ""You are J. Bourne, citizen of the United States, resident of New York City, `seventeen-twelve - zero-fourteen - twenty-six-zero' are the most important things in your life.""  He recites this to himself in the mirror to memorize who he is, mostly to convince himself.  However, as Bourne learns more of his past and first endangers and later saves Marie St. Jacques, someone he can finally trust, you begin to understand him and his motive; to find out his past.  The reader is just like Bourne; he doesn't know his past and neither do we.  As readers we find out everything about Bourne at the same time as he does.

In addition to Bourne, we are given another character to watch change with Bourne.  ""[She was in her] mid-thirties and spoke French softly, rapidly"" (64).  ""A woman in a dark red dress, the rich color of the silk complementing her long, titian hair....  Auburn hair"" (68).  Marie St. Jacques first encounters Bourne in an elevator and the two don't talk until he requests her help with something.  At first she comes across as stuck-up and then very emotional.  However, Marie has the same reaction to Bourne as the reader does at first; Bourne is ruthless and calculating yet as we come to know Bourne we change our view, and Marie comes to want to help him.

Representation of Reality
Ludlum's extensive knowledge of events in the book allows us to step into an alternate reality of espionage, an amnesic spy and danger.  This is partly due to the accuracy of his description of places and dealings but also through the use of foreign languages. Through his extensive knowledge Ludlum invites us into the world of Jason Bourne, to live what he lives.  ""The cranial wound was the real problem; not only was the penetration subcutaneous, but it appeared to have bruised the thalamus and hippocampus fibrous regions"" (13).  The description of where the wound is is vivid and we know exactly where on the head Bourne was shot.  Bourne and Marie are chased by German hired killers who yell at them in German.  Similarly Bourne and Marie interrupt an Italian presenter and he yells "" insoffribile! Ci sono comunisti qui!"" (73). Through the foreign language we get a real sense for where we are and who these people are.

Conclusion
As the tangled web of espionage, conspiracy, and suspense begins to unravel, the reader is taken along for Bourne's journey to self-discovery and inner struggle between good and evil, entering a world of double crossing, betrayal and back-stabbing.  Ludlum uses vivid imagery, extensive characterization and a real sense of reality to appeal to all readers creating an amazing book that all should read.",1194912000,,6196,4.745794392523364
2331272,4,B0009WK5CW,"There is a compelling power to the Bourne trilogy films: The martial elegance of a supreme hunter; the beauty of reborn innocence; the inspired acting of Matt Damon - a stoic killing machine who protects children and whose goodness we admire more with each passing moment - and an action story deeply planted in character rather than built on gadgetry. In short this film delivers.

The plot is excellent. Like Roger Zelazny's Amber Chronicles and Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun, the protagonist wakes in critical condition unable to remember himself, immediately confronting death while piecing together the puzzle of his own shattered identity. Meantime a hostile world seeks Jason Bourne's destruction.

Loosely based on the inspired works of fiction by former US Marine Robert Ludlum, the Bourne Identity portrays the CIA MKUltra program of creating ""Manchurian Candidates"" (through a smorgasbord of hypnosis, martial arts training, and torture). Ie, hypno-programmed robot assassins: ""It's like behavioral software"". But in Jason Bourne's case the software has crashed: ""You're a malfunctioning thirty million dollar weapon"". The movie is also a mute commentary on the bitter heartlessness of the modern intelligence state, and the moral twilight of CIA Clandestine Services.

Fished from the sea, healed by a wise old man, aided by a beautiful maiden, assaulted by ghouls, seeking to escape a labyrinth of unknown dangers, the hero triumphs. That's the Bourne Identity. Pure heroic myth depicted in great cinema.

2331288,3,B0009WK5CW,"Like many people I came to this book through the movies based on Robert Ludlum's Bourne novels. I read THE JANSON DIRECTIVE several years ago (blew through it on a 30-hour train ride between Kolkata and Chennai), and though it was entertaining enough to pass the time with, I felt like it was essentially literary packing foam. I wasn't looking for Les Miserables, mind you, but Ludlum's characters are pretty mechanical, operating basically to show off a hidden world of espionage, conspiracy, and cool gadgets. There's nothing essentially wrong with this kind of novel, but I prefer character-driven fiction, where I can see personalities of some complexity and depth grapple with challenges and come out changed somehow. As far as I can tell, Ludlum didn't write this kind of novel often.

But THE BOURNE IDENTITY is an attempt at this kind of novel. The main character, so-called ""Jason Bourne,"" is not struggling against assassins and CIA operatives for some political agenda or even merely to save his own life. He is trying to understand himself, to learn who he is. As one character states (as an almost shameless declaration of the ""moral of the story""), ""In a way, [Bourne is] a functioning microcosm of us all. I mean, we're all trying to find out who the hell we are, aren't we?"" Such internal conflict, however, is handled quite clumsily in Ludlum's hands, which seem unaccustomed to dealing with emotional subtleties. Credit should go to the makers of the Bourne movies (Matt Damon and the rest of the cast prominent among them) for breathing life and depth into these characters.

I was a bit disappointed at how much of the mysteries surrounding Bourne's character are resolved for the reader not through Bourne himself learning the truth, but through a significant number of scenes where Bourne's adversaries discuss the details of his past life amongst themselves. For me this sucked the momentum out of the winding up scenes, and left me feeling like I'd missed the climax.

One last thing: those picking up THE BOURNE IDENTITY having seen the movies should be aware that the novel was published in 1980. While many of the basic premises remain the same, this is not exactly the same story you saw on screen. This is not at all a bad thing, but some people get really upset when they're expecting a perfect translation between literature and film or vice versa.",1189468800,,2380,4.871604938271605

Now, this film couldn't fail because so many things work for it. The cast... top notch. Surprise factor... check. Simply... it's not what you'd expect. Damon as an action [anti]hero?, techno-drama in technicolor, gritty european adventure, short to-the-point witty yet realistic dialogue. Fast, brutal violence. No BS. Franka Potente as an accidental girl-friend, her bright girly sarcasm balanced against Bourne's straight thinking. Haunting score, symphonic mixed with electronic, sometimes nostalgic the other times pumps you up with drum&bass.
From the perspective of bad guys (scenes in the agency shot through brownish warm filter look very nice) it's an example of `your sins are gonna hunt you down'.

Hard to say what influenced Doug Liman here but film noir for sure. The Matrix (during action sequences)? Maybe...

I'd take half a star away there for the `funny' ending. Not a bad ending at all... just felt a bit campy. Although, alternative ending doesn't fit too well either.",1188259200,,1010,5.30625

2331301,3,B0009WK5CW,"Imagine waking up in an unfamiliar place, unable to recall where you live, what you're doing there, or even your own name. Now imagine for the first time in your life it wasn't a direct result of your downing eleven pints of Guinness and then agreeing to do a Lemon Drop shooter with Jimmy T., Spleef, and Hondo the night before at Durty Nelly's.

Now imagine that you began to discover you had mysterious talents -- talents that didn't involve the ability to stand next to the open refrigerator door in your underpants and drink a half gallon of Minute Maid Pulp Free directly from the pitcher without stopping for air.

Now imagine you are Matt Damon. Why, the mere thought of it is to stare into a bottomless well of agony. Yet Matt Damon awakes to that fresh horror every morning of his life (the horror of discovering that he remains Matt Damon, not all that stuff about his memory. That happens to his character in that one movie - what's it called? - The Bourne Identity. My memory's not so good.)

Anyway, the point is that Bourne Identity is a pulse-pounding thriller that goes from the exotic...um, somethings of somewhere to the even more exotic - look, it's tough to recall all the little things, I'm just a little fuzzy today. Suffice it to say that Bourne Identity makes for a terrific RiffTrax - and the fact that Mike is joined by Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, well, that's just -- what do you call it, that brown runny stuff - gravy!",1187827200,,1451,4.488636363636363
2331302,4,B0009WK5CW,"The first of the cinematic Jason Bourne trilogy (from the Ludlum books) introduces a hero (?) who, quite literally, has to find himself. Damon plays Bourne, who we meet half-dead, floating around in the ocean, shot in the back and miraculously recovered by career fishermen. When he comes to, he doesn't remember who he is ...

... but he does remember how to fight, play spy, break into and out of places, and--of course--kill. Jason Bourne is targeted by the CIA for elimination before he can even rightly appreciate his natural talents. And so goes the setup: Bourne must unravel the mystery of his identity while simultaneously evading government-sponsored assassination. Along the way, he befriends the cutest woebegone gypsy he can find in the American embassy. Naturally--wouldn't be a spy movie without the babe, now, would it?

But the Bourne identity works because, for the most part, it plays against the sleek, stylish, type-form of the spy film generated by the Bond franchise. Apart from two scenes of sheer impossibility, the action, and the plot, in this film seem very genuine: a down-in-the-dirt, nasty, and very convincing thriller. The car chase alone, where vehicles slowly crunch into each other instead of erupting into fireballs or being catapulted into flying helicopters, was refreshingly realistic.

Good stuff.

By  Thomas Chaplin ""An Avid Reader of Mysteries a... (Elk Grove, California) - See all my reviews

In my excitement to see the newly released Bourne Ultimatum, I decided to again watch the Bourne Identity, released in 2002. The Bourne Identity features the story by Robert Ludlum with Matt Damon as the amnesia addled Jason Bourne. Directed by Doug Liman (Mr. & Mrs. Smith), this visually pleasing spy thriller boasts excellent fight scenes, chase scenes, and suspense. Matt Damon does an outstanding job as Bourne. Having read the book years ago, I was interested in how well Damon would do as Bourne. He did not disappoint. Having watched the Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy, I can not imagine another actor better suited for the role. Franka Potente, as Marie, does a fine job as the girl who gives Bourne a ride to Paris. Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and Chris Cooper provide excellent acting support. This is a thrilling movie that is incredibly well-done. Matt Damon as an ""average guy"" thrown into mysterious circumstances really excels here.

The movie features stunning shots from a variety of excellent locales throughout Europe. A group of assassins are activated to kill Bourne, and the fun begins. This movie offers two hours of fun filled thrills and suspense. I highly recommend this 5 star movie.",1186358400,,1353,4.925438596491228

2331307,5,B0009WK5CW,"This is the kind of movie that would have made Alfred Hitchcock or John Huston proud to have made.  I read the original Robert Ludlum book when it first came out and found it one of those books you couldn't put down.  I remember staying up all night just to finish it.  The movie is as true to the book as anyone could want while constantly keeping wanting to know what will happen next.  The ending is the type that will satisfy just about everyone, and not what you expected. Except for the second ending which is kind of a throw away.

A short synopsys is that a man is found floating in the Mediterranean by a fishing boat.  He is in a wetsuit and has been shot twice in the back.  He also has an implanted device in his hip that gives the name and address of a bank in Zurich.  The man (Jason Bourne) doesn't remember who he is or how he came to be in the water.  His only clue is the numbered bank account.  So he heads off to Switzerland.  From there everything else follows; he finds money, six passports and a gun.  So who am I and what do I do?  Well my first guess would be that your a spy, but in the movies it's never that simple.

There are a couple of incidents that don't ring true: 1)how he crosses the border into Switzerland on a train without a passport is not explained, 2) how Marie manages to park behind the bank when no else is parked there,
3)having been on the fishing boat for three weeks his hair looks like he had it cut yesterday (in fact it looks that way through the whole movie),  4)when he drives with Marie overnight to Paris (say twelve hours), sleeping in the car, when he awakes, he clean shaven, no stubble at all (and once again not a hair out of place)and 5) he doesn't seem at all surprise when he beats the crap out of two Swiss Police on his first night in Zurich.",1186099200,,1809,4.128571428571429
2331308,5,B0009WK5CW,This is a fantastic movie.  It is on the edge of your seat excitement as you try to solve the identity of Jason Bourne.,1185840000,,119,3.9583333333333335
2331309,3,B0009WK5CW,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this novel. I knew it bore little resemblance to the movie, but not much else, and I'm not a big reader of this genre.

I found the first two-thirds of the novel tedious, a chore to read. The premise - a man with no memory - was established almost immediately, but the narrative degenerated into long-winded and pedantic conversations about international banking and security.

Presumably, this exposition was supposed to justify how the protagonist - Bourne - could successfully access a Swiss numbered bank account when he had no recollection of his identity. In fact, though, it had the reverse effect - anyone asking as many questions about security procedures would only draw attention to themselves.

Sadly, the characters' motivations and actions weren't much more believable as the story progressed. Bourne holds a woman as hostage to escape pursuit, and treats her abominably. Of course, she then falls in love with him, and turns out to be an expert in international banking - crucial to understanding the scheme Bourne finds himself caught up in.

The final third of the book greatly improves, though, as Bourne discovers the truth about his identity, and plots to outwit and eliminate his enemies.

In short, a novel of mixed quality, with equal parts enjoyment and frustration. I admit, though, that despite the book's flaws, I will probably read the second in the series.",1185494400,,1419,4.995762711864407
2331310,4,B0009WK5CW,"It is first of all an action film in which the whole action goes wrong because the agent did not do what he was supposed to do, he did not kill his target and he got shot at and he lost his memory. The story is unluckily not entirely clear. He forgot his identity. Fine. He did not forget his physical training. Fine because that kind of training has been ingrained so deeply that it has become an instinct of sorts. But how did he remember he had a bank account in Zurich and the number of the bank account, and what's more why did not the CIA close the account since the operation  had failed and the agent was supposed to be dead? This leads to more questions, but that is not really important for the action, though we like it absolutely clean. The message however is not altered at all. The CIA is able to train agents that have become plain robots and that can only succeed blindly in their mission or die or kill themselves if the first two options do not go through. These killing robots are in the hands of bureaucrats who are mostly incompetent and these bureaucrats are in the hands of  politicians who are first and foremost rotten liars. The objective is simple: control the world with puppets who can be anything, democratic tyrants or tyrannical democrats, no matter which or their reverses, provided they serve well, otherwise they die and the human killing robots get into the picture. When this film came out the US were starting to get engaged in the war on terrorism. The picture of this CIA is pretty terroristic to me. We know now, several years later that it was not that competent in gathering information, though it did gather some, but we also know that the politicians who used the information they got were pretty liars and making the incomplete information they got say whatever they wanted it to say. Is that very democratic? At the end of the film, when the politician is engaged in some new lie to the Senate, we are just relieved because the killing robot agent, Jason Bourne, has finally gotten out of it and has been able to trace the girl he dragged into the adventure unaware of what he was really dragging her into. But the story cannot be finished because the CIA cannot let him live just like that out of the goodness of their heart, for one simple reason: they do not have a heart. In other words, the cold war is maybe finished, but the terroristic spying agencies, politically correctly named intelligence agencies, are still thriving and well. We have not yet reached the country of perfect transparency and total democracy. And we pretend to give lessons to the barbarians who are not part of our club!

2331311,5,B0009WK5CW,"This is a terrifc movie for a weekend and while much fuss was made over particular omissions from Ludlum's great spy novel, the overall feel of the world he created remains. If every element from Ludlum's  novel were left in this would be a five hour movie. The book was that complex and jam-packed.

Director Doug Liman has retained the basic feel of the book and left the heart of the story in tact. He didn't try to glamourize the grittier aspects simply because he had a big budget with which to work. There is almost a low-key atmosphere which somehow makes all the action seem more real to the viewer. We see Paris and all the other countries only as background to the dark storyline we hope can have some kind of happy resolution as the film goes along.

Franke Potente is perfect as a girl who has no real roots herself, and what begins as a business proposition escalates into love, even if it must be a life on the run with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Damon proves he can really act in this film and does a great job as Bourne, a guy who has no idea who he is but has all the instincts of someone not quite part of everyday society.

A Swiss bank account and a dozen passports, along with a large sum of cash and a weapon, tells him something about what kind of life he has led, if not who he is exactly. He ponders the mystery in a Paris cafe with Marie (Potente) while instinctively making note of all the liscence plates of the vehicles parked outside. Why he does so, he doesn't know.

The romance that blossoms between Bourne and Marie becomes one more reason Bourne must find the answers to his identity as international assasins come after them at every turn. There is a moment in the film when he tries to make her leave him for safety because he loves her, and it is for that same reason she stays.

This is a gritty movie with a heart. The action sequences as Bourne's instincts kick in are terrific and the human elements are not lost along the way, which is a credit to Director Liman and the two stars, especially Damon, who separtated himself from a big pack and proved he had talent here.

We are left with a good feeling at the end of this film as both the action and romance are given their moments. I read this many years ago so perhaps the fact it was not fresh in my mind helped me enjoy it more. Taken simply as a really enjoyable film for a weekend, it's A+ entertainment.",1185062400,,2403,4.279735682819383
2331312,5,B0009WK5CW,"Most of this genre leaves me with a feeling of ""why should I care? My popcorn's gone, this is loud, I wish they'd all just die.""  But Matt Damon and Franka Potente are compelling and give pathos to the implausible.  In between the loud parts there is actually dialogue and acting and character progression, and it's all entertaining!  It's still an amusement park ride of a movie that's best suited to summer air conditioning, but that's all it aspires to be and it's the action movie at the top of its form.",1184371200,,508,4.5
2331313,2,B0009WK5CW,"Look, I know this review is going to anger Ludlum fans.  I'm sort of one too -- I really liked the two Matt Damon movies and am looking forward to the third.  I even liked the late 80's version done by Richard Chamberlain.  When I was in college, I couldn't put ""The Holcroft Covenant"" down (although I really don't know if I'd like it now).  But I found ""The Bourne Identity"" convoluted, absurd and just plain boring.

Italics: Cain is for Charlie! Delta is for Cain! Delta is for Charlie! Cain is for Carlos! Medusa!  Treadstone!  STOP IT!!!

What does it all mean?  I don't know and I don't care.  What I do know is that everyone around Jason is kind of like Lois Lane -- he puts on his tortoise shell glasses and he might as well be wearing a disguise that took hours to create by a professional make-up artist.  I also know that the most sophisticated super secret CIA hideout -- located in a Manhattan upper east brownstone  -- doesn't seen to contain any surveillance cameras.  And the most dangerous terrorist in the world gets in there rather easily by posing as a moving man.  For someone who's lived through Hell and can disable a man fifty ways in two seconds flat, Jason sure seems kind of whiny and uncertain, although, to be sure, he's an amnesiac (the character Matt Damon played was much more believable).

I understand that any thriller written more than a decade ago is not going to have cell phones, but I found it tedious that people couldn't contact each other.  I wish someone could explain to me what exactly the clothing boutique store had to do with the plot.  At one crucial point, Ludlum basically cuts and pastes an old French general (and his whore wife!!!) into the story, which I think was to make some sort of political point, but I'm not sure what.

""The Bourne Identity"" didn't work for me at all.  I actually bought the trilogy, but it's highly unlikely that I'll be reading the next two unless I get really bored and have nothing else to read.  Even then, I can just rent the two (and soon to be three) Damon movies.",1183334400,,2053,4.438502673796791

It went through all things a good Ludlum novel ought to go through: action packed, twisting plots, romance, conspiracy, character thoughts, and, unfortunately, repetition. Five of those six are gems, but the repetition wore me out nearing the end. I can only read ""Charlie is for delta; delta is for Cain"" (or something like that) so many times... then I have to cringe, bite my lip and suppress an urge to scream at the annoyance.

2331324,4,B0009WK5CW,"I'm not necessarily a big fan of Ludlum's novels and most of them are nothing special, but he sure hit a home run with this one. I read it when it first appeared -- having recently completed Le Carr's ""Smiley"" trilogy and concluded that no spy novel could ever match up to that masterpiece -- and became totally absorbed in the world and very short amnesiac life of Jason Bourne (a/k/a Delta, Cain, and several other pseudo-identities) as he tries to figure out just who he is, how he came by his highly specialized skills, what he's expected to do with them -- and just who is trying to kill him. And why. There's a certain amount of suspension of disbelief that's necessary here, especially in Bourne's relationship with Canadian Marie St. Jacques, who is very conveniently an economist, and also with the bitter French general who appears to do a one-eighty in an extremely short period of time. But I can live with that. Nor is the movie anything but the palest reflection of the novel. This is also not a book to race through in a weekend, not if you want to appreciate all the tangential complexities of the twisting plots, but it's worth the effort.",1177286400,,1156,4.5625

This will go down as one of Matt Damon's early best--a CIA piece of ""behavioral software"" short-circuted by the sight of children as he is about to perform an assasination.  The supporting cast is equally up to the task, a totally believable journey from the Meditteranean through Switzerland, France, and Paris, leading to the final confrontation between the rogue Damon and his CIA handler who must fly from Langley to meet him on a bridge in Paris.

Potente, one of my favorite young acresses who gives a solid performance (perhaps a female equivalent of Juergen Prochnow--except she spent a high school year in the U.S.in a HOuston suburb) is enchanting as the German Marie Kreutz, trying to find any way to travel to the U.S., whom Damon meets by accident in the U.S. Embassy in Switzerland.  As she ponders aloud, ""who pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris?""...as she is about to find out!

So I was very excited when I went to see The Bourne Indentity at the theater and I was not disappointed. The action is crisp and the fight scenes very realistic--no superhero stuff. Also, the protaganist, Matt Damon, is not presented as a hero, but a complicated individual, and I found myself wondering what had led him to his life as a spy/killer in the first place.

Matt Damon is very convincing in this and his costar, Franka Potente, is a breath of fresh air. A real European with a European look and a good actress.",1169251200,,758,4.368794326241135
2331334,3,B0009WK5CW,"I have this theory that the film and publishing business is dominated by the demands of the airline industry. Such fare has to be generally undemanding and mildly diverting, to take one's mind off the waiting in departure lounges and the subsequent firings through the air in tubes of metal, packed in like sardines (if The Almighty had not meant us to fly, He would not have given us in-flight movies). Mildly diverted by the second Bourne film of the same name (seen, yes! on a flight), starring Matt Damon, I thought I'd try the first book, having first rented the first film.

It has to be remembered that the book is much older than the film, and written when there still existed a Soviet Union and a super-terrorist Carlos (""The Jackal""), so the plots of film and book have in common really only the mysterious Jason Bourne, plucked from the sea full of bullet holes and with no memory of, well, anything - and who finds out very soon that the world is apparently full of people who remember him only too well and are out to erase both him and his memory completely. He also finds that he is full of interesting abilities in the more destructive arts. It's quite a nice twist on the usual secret agent thriller, as Bourne fights with both his external enemies and  his internal demons, things that hover on the periphery of his consciousness, maddeningly (almost literally) just out of reach.

The story is well told but just a little bit too pat. How likely is it that an amnesiac would find an ally in a woman (beautiful and beddable naturally) who is also a financial whiz, just the thing he needs for the banks with which he must deal? And is it so easy is it for two strangers in Switzerland to find a doctor who will treat bullet wounds and say nothing to the local constabulary? As is usually the case with such thrillers, there is much detail that has to be taken on trust (the workings of private banks), and that are there probably only to give a verisimilitude of accuracy, but which are only peripheral to the story and do not need to be mastered, the way one can drive a car without knowing how a gearbox works. My confidence in Mr. Ludlum was shaken somewhat by seeing Lenzburg, the substantial town through which I pass every day on my way to work, described as ""a village outside Zrich"", and the Paris police described as ""gendarmes"".

Flaws aside, the book is, like the film, mildly diverting, with the big BANG! WHAM! climax standard for such books, in which Carlos (just) gets away, thus leaving the door open for sequels. In all, just the thing for those long, boring flights. There are (I think) two other Bourne books. Will I read them? Depends on when is the next long flight...",1168300800,,2707,4.507128309572302
2331335,5,B0009WK5CW,"Plot Summary: A man-without-a-memory found floating in the Mediterranean Sea searches for his identity, discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin.

Reason for the Rating: Violence and some language.

Based on the Robert Ludlum-authored book by the same name, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is part action flick, part stylized thriller. In his first role as an erstwhile action hero, Matt Damon shines as Bourne, imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is ease.

As the story opens, Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an Italian fishing boat. The ""hey, this is a story about espionage"" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from Bourne that displays what we later learn is a Swiss bank account number. Upon finding and opening the safe deposit box, Bourne discovers multiple passports (including one with the name Jason Bourne), a variety of foreign currency, and a gun. He then begins his search to uncover his true identity--and until now, so does the audience.

If there is one misstep in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, it may be the fact that early scenes involving the CIA and the agency's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to Bourne's identity far earlier than Bourne himself. At this point the film becomes more of a ""how will he survive?"" thriller rather than a ""who am I?"" mystery.

A love interest of sorts (played nicely by Run Lola Run actress Franka Potente) gives Bourne a ""partner in crime"" to play off of for much of the movie, but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development. An implied (off-screen) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief, but doesn't detract too much from the action.

The most interesting (and morally significant) moment in the film comes when Bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on. Through this pivotal flashback (and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense), we learn that the highly-trained killing machine isn't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target's children in the room with him. Bourne's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film's premise as he is shot, falling into the Mediterranean Sea.

Smartly directed, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is fast-paced without feeling rushed. The Cinematographer paints the European setting in shades of grays and yellows, giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama. As an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities, this film is a winner for older teens and adults.

Nappaland.com Recommends: Ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride--THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a worthy discovery.

After the Show...If members of your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward:

---What do you think prompted Jason Bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht? What does this say about Bourne's moral compass?

---How would you feel if you suddenly couldn't remember who you were? What actions would you take to discover your identity?

---When faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done, Jason Bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew. When have you felt that way? How can a relationship with Jesus give us a ""second chance"" in the truest sense?

2331336,5,B0009WK5CW,"This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book ""The Bourne Identity"". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.

The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural ""Bourne"" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.

Matt Damon, looking very buff, portrays Bourne as an intelligent, resourceful character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them. Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.

This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale. Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre. This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.",1167091200,,2247,4.652392947103275

2331338,2,B0009WK5CW,The Bourne movies are extremely boring. The pacing is slow and the plots are uninteresting. Jason Bourne is an unlikable character and has no personality what so ever.

2331339,5,B0009WK5CW,"It's been a very long time since I enjoyed watching a movie this much.

In fact I have to go back to the 1960s when the old Town Theater in Watertown, NY used to have James Bond marathons.  The kids would all cheer when James got out of a tough spot.

This movie is sort of a James Bond for adults.  It closes the gap between what's totally impossible and what could be somewhat believable (with a little imagination that is).

The characters captured my interest immediately due to the perfect casting.  You feel like these are real people.

They try to keep the main character sort of impersonable.  You rarely see him eat anything, no big sex scenes.  All of this is consistent with making him appear to be almost super human.

It is quite funny at times as the girlfriend tries to comprehend what she has gotten herself into.  ""He went out the window.  Why would somebody do that ?""

Technically there are great fight scenes and weapons throughout the movie. They use a lot of silencers.  It is true a ball point pen can be used to inflict serious injury on someone.  However I don't know how true it is that two karate experts can continously smash each other in the face.

Some people believe that the guy who killed Robert Kennedy was under some sort of mind control.  He doesn't remember anything about what happened.

We saw recently that a former KGB agent was poisoned in England with some bizzare radioactive substance.

Yes those intelligence agencies are still out there.

As often happens when people create something dangerous they themselves eventually become the victims of their own creation.

2331340,5,B0009WK5CW,"Matt Damon plays a CIA agent (Bourne) who loses his identity after a botched job. His handlers think he is a rogue agent and call in all ""assets"" to take him out. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a classy, realistic film. By realistic, I mean not only the various sets in Paris and Switzerland and on a trawler in the Mediterranean, but the fact that Damon, when he is zapping some bad guy, usually finds himself in a hell of a fight. The bad guys are GOOD! That goes to make this a more believeable thriller than, say, MI III, where the bad guys are push overs and our hero is amazing. Damon does a great acting job as a believeably tough guy who can think fast on his feet. There is a sweet, understated love interest with Franka Potente, a fresh screen face, not too beautiful, which also lends to realism, who plays a stranger whom Damon befriends. Adapted from Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name, the screenplay is tight and keeps the viewer wondering, along with Damon, who he is and how he will survive. In essense, this is a chase-and-run flick, with the CIA (again) as the bad guys. They give a good account of themselves, however, but Damon was apparently trained to be the best.

I had thought the ""EEE"" would be the Director's Cut, or something similar.  It is not.

Still, I hope plans are in the works to film ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", the 3rd of the Bourne trilogy.  (There is also a 4th book, ""The Bourne Legacy"", but that was not written by Robert Ludlum.)",1158364800,,755,4.905511811023622
2331346,5,B0009WK5CW,"It's not easy to make a good suspense thriller these days.  Hollywood directors seem to forget this sometimes, but lots of explosions and fight scenes really aren't enough to satisfy audiences today.  You've got to tell a good story and deliver some well-developed characters if you want to make a worthwhile film,

The strength of this film is revealed by the fact that it actually makes an amnesia plotline succeed.  When we meet Jason Bourne, he is being pulled out of the sea by local fisherman and remembers nothing about his past - including how he got there and who put two bullets in his back.  Most intriguingly, though, he has some kind of implant housing information about a bank account in Zurich.  The mystery deepens once he discovers the contents of his bank lockbox: tens of thousands of dollars, various passports, and a handgun.  In keeping with some unusual talents he has inherited from whoever he used to be, he is able to act instinctively once unknown assailants come after him, eventually escaping Zurich with the help of a young woman named Marie (Franka Potente).  The two travel to Paris, where Bourne's attempt to stir up the old memory banks is rudely interrupted by an assassin crashing in to his apartment and trying to kill him.  Determined more than ever to get to the bottom of his personal story, he and Marie become fugitives, surviving several near misses with authorities as they struggle to figure out what the heck is going on.  When I say authorities, I don't mean law enforcement officers; the guys hunting him down want to clean up a dirty intelligence operation that went awry.  Bourne, having failed in his mission, has become a liability, and the high-level desk jockeys back in DC are in full CYA mode.

This really is an impressive thriller, with a tight plot and fascinating leading characters - even though it's never absolutely clear to me why Marie stays with a man who stands a very good chance of getting her killed.  Granted, there is a little romance thrown into the mix, but it never gets in the way of the action.  Franka Potente is an amazing actress who should be as famous here as she is in her native Germany, and this is a great opportunity for American audiences to see her in action.

If you want to make a compelling political thriller, it certainly makes sense to seek out the work of Robert Ludlum, one of the premiere writers in the genre.

2331350,5,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne Identity is high on my list of all time favorite movies.  Matt Damon plays a former government agent who thanks to a series of unfortunate events finds himself with amnesia, unconscious and floating in the sea, which is where the movie starts.  The rest of the movie follows his journey trying to figure out who he is and how he came to be floating in the sea with bullet wounds in his back.  Of course his quest is made a little more difficult when the government decides they would rather he just disappear.

This movie will hold your attention from the very beginning, the plot is interesting and the movie very well made.  The main character Jason Bourne (Damon) is likeable and intriguing.  The action is exciting and there really is no part of the movie where you start checking your watch to see if it is nearly over.  In fact this is one of those movies that holds your interest from start to finish.

Now for the negatives:  I've heard that the movie does not follow the book too closely.  Well boo hoo, if you'd rather read the book then do so.  The government agency portrayed in this movie is a little ridiculous.  Basically they make a phone call and immediately get the cooperation of police and agencies all over the world.  They tap a few computer keys and immediately have access to surveillance camera images and other detailed information from all over the world.  Sure America is a superpower, but the level of cooperation between America and the rest of the world is simply not this good.

Finally on the negative side, there is one stunt where Borne falls several stories down a stairwell shaft while accurately shooting people and uses a body to cushion the fall.  This takes the suspension of disbelief a little too far.  I don't see anyone surviving such a fall in real life.  I don't really see how this sequence was necessary to the plot.

But for all the petty negatives this is one of those movies that I loved the first time, and continue to watch to this day.  I'm sure I've seen it more than a dozen times, and there are not many movies I like to watch that often.

2331351,5,B0009WK5CW,"As a strategy consultant, & whenever I go to the movies (or watch movies at home), I often take the opportunity to seek out possibilities of using them to teach life (survival) skills to participants in my seminars & workshops.

The two Bourne movies, namely The Bourne Identity & The Bourne Supremacy, are two great examples.

Both movies are loosely based on Robert Ludlum's work, which included The Rheinmann Exchange, The Osterman Weekend & the Holcroft Covenant. They have also been made into great movies.

In the first move, with the opening scene: An unconscious young man is pulled out off the Mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night. Thinking that the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back & a microchip in his hip. The chip reveals a Swiss bank account. But our wet hero isn't dead but realises that he has amnesia. He then rushes to Zurich. In the bank vault, he discovers his name, Jason Bourne (played by Mark Damon). In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a large chunk of cash. In the US Embassy, he bumps into Marie (played by Franka Potente), along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills, & with Marie by his side, he scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life...& finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots (one assassin was played by Clive Owen, as 'The Profesosr') masterminded by rouge elements of the CIA.

In the second movie, with the opening scene, continuing from the first movie: Jason Bourne is recovering in Goa, India with Marie. He spots a mysterious dark-glassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging. He escapes with Marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase. The next scene shows CIA operatives under deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in CIA but something goes wrong. Her subsequent investigation leads to the highly-classified Treadstone project, which apparently involves Jason Bourne. She even finds evidence that Bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation. So Bourne sets out to clear his name. The remaining part of the movie shows Bourne outsmarting CIA operatives - & the assassin (played menacingly by Karl Urban as Kirill) - & tracking down the rogue elements in the CIA with shady connections to the Russian mob, who have jointly framed him in the first place.

In the two movies, Jason Bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe & pay attention to what's around him - note: notice the exceptions in the details of the environment - which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators & at the same time, stay agile (mentally & physically) to anticipate dangers & get out of precarious situations.

For example...remember the scene in the second movie...after he had jogged at the beach, he observed a dark-glassed man whose clothing & behaviour somehow did not match the environment...

His ability to stay calm, size up dangerous situations & come up with super-quick, innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both movies.

For example...remember the scene in the first movie, where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircase...the scene in the second movie, where he improvised a weapon out of rolled newspapers & an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gas-filled room...Wow! that was great!

Naturally, I am also fascinated by the many unique fighting sequences (particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie), car chases, cat & mouse games, etc. in both movies.

Additionally, what I like about both movies is the total absence of super-duper gadgets commonly found in such spy-thriller movies. Jason Bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity & creativity to outsmart his enemies.

To end my review, I must add that I have enjoyed watching both movies, experientially as well as educationally.",1153440000,,4114,4.913544668587896
2331352,2,B0009WK5CW,"Admittedly, the reason I read The Bourne Identity had everything to do with how much I enjoyed the recent film of the same name.  However, the book bears very little resemblance to the movie.  So little in fact that I wonder if the writers of the movie recognized the same weaknesses in the book as I did: shoddy writing, a confused and over-complicated plot, and a ridiculously juvenile, untenable love story.

I kept expecting the story to pick up and sweep me away as most great novels do, and I tried to gloss over my own revulsion at the soap opera dialog, and blaze undaunted through the remainder of the book...sort of like sitting through a movie you know you don't like much, but sticking around because you've already spent your money to see it.

The premise of the story is also hampered by a sort of cowboys and indians, good versus evil, over-simplified rationale on the part of Ludlum's characters.  Their motives are described plainly enough throughout the book, yet those motives are difficult to understand because they seem so casually overwrought.  Both Bourne and his nemesis, Carlos are laughably thin characterizations.  So much so that I found myself reminded time and time again of The Young and the Restless...especially when the story involved Marie.  Too often, her character came across as wooden and forced.  I don't buy her devotion to Bourne for a minute.  I was actually hoping that she would turn out to be an undercover agent or a psycho or something...anything to make her character more interesting or believable.

I have heard that the second and third books in this series are better, but The Bourne Identity doesn't give me enough reasons to find out for myself.  This is the only instance I've found where the movie is better than the book.

As action movies go, it was pretty good. But as the movie came to a close I got more and more disappointed. The movie does not follow the book and makes some pretty significant changes!

I don't know if the book's plot twists were just too complicated for the movie or what but I wish the film makers had at least tried.

Overall though, The Bourne Identity is a great action flick. My husband hadn't read the book and he loved it. My recommendation would be to wait a while before watching the movie if you've already read the book or watch the movie before reading the book. The book is so good anyway that reading it after the movie will probably just make it's more intense plot that much more entertaining.

Bottom line - enjoy them but take them as separate works. Don't expect them to be alike, otherwise you'll be disappointed like I was.",1152230400,,1006,4.48087431693989
2331355,4,B0009WK5CW,"I really loved this book. It was one of those that is hard to put down - full of suspense - all that. I would highly recommend it - and I don't always get into the ""spy"" genre but this one is definitely enjoyable.

I enjoyed the book so much that I looked forward to the movie starring Matt Damon - BUT I was very disappointed. Some of the really cool plot twists that made the book so unique and thrilling were not included in the movie. I kept wondering how they could even consider following up the first movie with the sequels when the movie got the whole premise of who Bourne turns out to be so wrong. I guess they just couldn't keep up with the plot twists in the movie? I don't know, but I wish they'd tried.

Now don't get me wrong - watching the movie knowing nothing about the book, it is a strong action/thriller. My husband loved it. But having read the book it just ruined the movie for me. So my recommendation for anyone reading the book - enjoy it! It's wonderful. But don't have high expectations for the movie to be a close representation.

Maybe watching the movie first is the better way to go - but that might just be confusing since who Bourne is turns out so differently. Either way - enjoy both book and movie - just give yourself sufficient space between them.",1152230400,,1286,4.262295081967213
2331356,4,B0009WK5CW,"I read this in the libary for curiousity after seeing the TV mini-series and 2003 re-make.  While written in the 1980s, this book's concept could still rival other works written today.

If any of you have seen the movie or TV mini-series, you know the premise.  A spy is shot in the back, revived by a doctor, and struggles to regain not only his identity, but his mission.  He learns his name is Jason Bourne, but is he really a reputable cold-blooded killer like others say he is?  While some spy novels only contain biff-bam action, this story contains enough suspense and plot twists to keep the reader glued.

The only things not making this book a 5 star are the old style cover and the COMPLEX back-story of Bourne's origin.  Other than that, you have an excellent example of spy fiction at its heyday.",1150934400,,809,4.537931034482758

2331358,5,B0009WK5CW,"This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book ""The Bourne Identity"". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.

The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural ""Bourne"" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.

Matt Damon, looking very buff, portrays Bourne as an intelligent, resourceful character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them. Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.

This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale. Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre. This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.",1149120000,,2247,4.652392947103275
2331359,4,B0009WK5CW,"I was propelled to read this book after watching the movie- and I decided to read the first of three Bourne books.  It took four days to read this book during a family vacation.  Needless to say, the book was hard to put down.  The story is captivating, slowly (although sometimes too slowly) revealing to the reader the twists and turns in the plot.  The main character is a fascinating character, slowly coming to life in the book through his own self-realization.  This was an interesting way to reveal a main character.  Though the character and his circumstances are seemingly beyond the realm of possibility, the plot of the book is amazing, tying everything together resulting in pleasurable reading.

On a negative note- at times the book goes slow for my taste.  The strength of this book is not in the author's writing style, but in his ability to tell a suspenseful story.  At times the book tries to get too cute and too clever concerning the writing.  This author will never win any Pulitzers, and I don't believe he should even try.  Also, I realize that there probably needs to be a girl for the main character- but why does she and her interaction with the main character have to be both boring and unbelievable?  Outside of these things the book was thoroughly enjoyable.  I plan on reading the two following installments in the Bourne series.  In a closing note, the movie is good- but hardly resembles the book.  I think it would be too difficult to make a good movie by sticking closely to the book, but I was a little bit disappointed that there were few resemblances.",1148083200,,1589,4.625

The plot very long and convoluted with many storylines and associated subplots becomes a maze, forcing the reader to wonder many times and sometimes to read some pages more than one time to get a full comprehension of what is behind the events

Though there is a lot of action, the plot is focused on the main character Jason Bourne, a former top rank agent suffering from amnesia and rescued from the sea near France

Is Jason Bourne actually Jason Bourne?

Who is behind Jason Bourne? What is behind Jason Bourne ?

Why Jason lost his memory? Why did they do that to Jason ?

The action is complemented with Bourne rival  colossal terrorist and international assassin Carlos, who felt challenged by Jason Bourne past activities and began to chase him around the globe to kill him in order to attain supremacy in his ruthless business

Another interesting point arises in the plot, will Carlos and Jason Bourne finally clash ?

Actions goes on mostly in Zurich, Paris and New York locations, involving Swiss banks secrecy laws, the CIA, French  Security Agencies, and US military clandestine organizations

The plot of 'The Bourne Identity' is a simple theme which has been explored before in other books and films. A secret agent goes deeply undercover and, unfortunately, loses his memory. For the rest of the story he exists in a limbo of betrayal, intrigue and death, where he can only trust his instincts and adrenalin rush. The only ally he has is a woman he grabbed as a hostage (talk about the Stockholm Syndrome!) and, later, an aging French politician.

With their help, the amnesiac gets closer to learning who -- and what -- he is and why an assassin like Carlos wants him dead. The climactic confrontation is an edge-of-the-seat, un-put-downable rollercoaster ride. Unfortunately, the epilogue leaves much to be desired.

Then my girlfriend bought it before me, but she got the full screen version. No biggie. I just prefer to see the whole movie and not have the sides lopped off like full screen versions do to fit a 4:3 TV.

Then after ""Bourne Supremacy"" came out in theater and on DVD, ""Identity"" came back out on DVD again in a new edition ""Explosive"". I thought about buying this edition, but read the reviews on Amazon first. Apparently there isn't much ""new explosive"" stuff on it. And the DTS soundtrack is gone. Well the missing DTS was enough to get me to look for the old Collector's edition. I am not a fan of bonus material. It's nice if a DVD has it, but no biggie if it don't.

Jason Bourne however doesn't have all this things, which makes this movie a lot more realistic. The fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining. The action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets, and no incredibly willing women sharing his bed.

2331370,4,B0009WK5CW,"Director:  Doug Liman

Cast:  Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Gabriel Mann, Walton Goggins, Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles.

Running Time:  119 minutes

Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a cold blooded assassin, but he doesn't know it. He can kill anyone with just a glance, yet he doesn't even recognize his own name. Left for dead when a hit goes wrong, Jason is rescued from his watery grave in the sea and stitched up by Italian fishermen. Set loose in Europe, Jason tries to put the pieces of his life together (including his rapidly emerging ability to inflict violence when prompted) as it becomes clear that this dangerous and mysterious man is suffering from amnesia. Bourne is helped by Marie (Franka Potente from ""The Princess and the Warrior"" and ""Run Lola Run""), a German woman desperate for cash, who takes Jason out of the dangerous hive of Paris to safety, but soon finds herself in deeper trouble than Bourne. On their tail are two dueling government agents (Brian Cox and Chris Cooper from ""American Beauty"") who would like nothing more than a dead Bourne, and a team of assassins who are sent out to finish the job.

The poster for `The Bourne Identity' screams: `Matt Damon Is Jason Bourne.' Honestly, they couldn't be more right. In perhaps his biggest star performance to date, Damon conquers his new film with the authority of a Schwarzenegger, and the sleekness of a Brosnan. His performance is elaborate, moving back and forth from a man who doesn't understand what he's capable of, to a man who uses his capabilities to answer all of his questions. With his natural physicality, Damon can play the role easily. But with his ever-searching actor instincts, Damon finds shades within Jason Bourne to play with; just enough to help elevate the movie into territory Bond stopped trying to reach for three decades ago. Damon's chemistry with Potente is also a treat, as the film never veers too much into romantic territory, but leaves enough room for the heat between the two to seep through. They work very well together.  The real star of the picture is director Doug Liman, formerly of the anemic 1996 comedy ""Swingers"" and the appealing 1999 caper ""Go"". There is nothing in those two films that would suggest that Liman is capable of handling a spy thriller. And that's the beauty of `The Bourne Identity.' It's a story (here based on the best selling series by Robert Ludlum) that's been in play many times before, and Liman takes the challenge head on. Directing with a dazzling flair for tension and action set pieces, Liman conducts his ""Bourne"" very simply and efficiently. There are minimal explosions, no godforsaken quips from the lips of the characters, and the film is one of the fastest paced in recent memory.

Liman is helped by fantastic European locations (shot crisply by Oliver Wood), an exhilarating score by John Powell (""Shrek""), and a swift script by Tony Gilroy and W. Blake Herron, but you can easily tell Liman's heart and dedication is really into the story and the characters. His heart is into the action as well, with the film containing many impressive hand-to-hand combat scenes that feel fresh and real, a mid-movie car chase that spells doom for any fingernails in the audience, and a climactic shootout that has Bourne literally riding another bad guy down the middle of a staircase. Wild, unpredictable moments like these are scattered throughout the film, and they make the ride that much more pleasurable. Liman has a clear vision for ""The Bourne Identity"", and his mission is accomplished.",1138492800,,3648,4.907467532467533
2331371,4,B0009WK5CW,"First I'm just reviewing this movie and I have never read the Bourne Novels nor have I seen the old Miniseries from 1988 so I am comparing this movie to nothing. My one and only problem with this film is the leading female actress Franka Potente (Marie), I don't know if it was her character that was annoying or just her in general. She was constantly in the way and almost making you want something to happen to her character.

It almost seems like the producers thought if they put a girl who isn't all that cute and has mediocre acting skills then there's no way she could out shine Matt Damon and boy did it work. For a minute you start to think Matt is playing his role a bit weak but then you realize he's good at playing a man who has lost his memory. The fight sequences are fantastic and this is where you start to give a little respect because all the fights are perfect but I think they could of used a little bit more of them, maybe two or three.

The plot kind of reminds you of the Replacement Killers when Chow Yun-Fat wasn't able to assassinate the cop because the guys son was right there with him when he tried to do it but Chow wasn't trained by the government and definitely not as dangerous or exciting. If your watching this thinking it's a movie where you start to feel for the characters then don't bother with it, Bourne didn't even show too much feelings for his new love Marie. This is a plain old action flick with a nice and interesting story. Overall this is a movie that will have you loving it for the action and the crazy car chase in the Mini Cooper but I really think another leading actress was needed.",1138233600,,1639,4.25

I was wrong, it is slow going, with long periods of in-action, the story reads well and while you feel for Bourne aka Delta, aka Cain, aka Webb... The movie pulls it off much better, by giving you a story that while it is not as complicated, still tells a good story with a meaningful plot.

Matt Damon is pretty good in this remake, he carries the movie, but still he is not Richard Chamberlain. The female leading character is plain annoying. She comes across not so much as helpless but plain dumb and annoying. And she keeps repeating the ""S"" word in German. Is it really fashionable nowadays to repeatedly say the ""S"" word in a foreign language so it doesn't get beeped out? She must have said it like 20 times.

2331376,4,B0009WK5CW,"""The Bourne Identity"" begins the Bourne saga a few years after the Vietnam conflict.  Mixed with cunning encounters and wild surprises, it is difficult to envision some ad hoc events occurring within the suspicious undercover sphere.

The dialogue between characters nearing a page in length could use more or occasionally any action to convey emotion and interaction.  Whenever action does occur amidst conversation, touching the other persons face seems to be the atypical primary contact.  Expressions comparable to ""that is what you said"" remarked too often while quoting each other.  Several diverse characters solve problems using parallel logical processes, an unlikely event.  Also when a character comprehends the French language it would behoove the publisher to translate the text for those not fluent with the words.

Other than the Vietnam conflict and John F. Kennedy assassination references, the story could reasonably translate to the modern era.  The rather amazing conclusion holds ones curious as to how the main characters politically continue in subsequent novels.

As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movies (transpiring near or after the turn of the millennium) thereby leaving the series entirely to the imagination.

I recommend this series to any fan of the action spy genre.

2331377,5,B0009WK5CW,"When i was reading the book i started to think that the book was 100% better than the movie.  Even though Matt Damon is a great actor, but i still would have to say, read the book.

This was my first Robert Ludlum novel.  During the book i kept thinking whats gong to happen next.  He is one of those authors where you can not put the book down or else you have to start over.

Luldum started off with a lot of detail.  In the beginning Jason Bourne woke up from his comma in a doctors office because he got shot in the head by a bullet in the Medatarian Sea and did not know where he was or what his name was.  The doctor found out there was a microfilm with a Swiss bank account.  Also he realizes that he speaks three different languages.  then later on he finds out that he is very deadly with hand to hand combat.  that is just the begining.

the only complaint i have even though there were barely any, is that i do not know why Ludlum would have Borne shot so many times and never dies or really stops and gets caught. like he just takes a bullet and thats it.  but other why's this book is amazing.  i really like this a lot.  i would recommend this to anyone who loves action novels.  i read to the late night and my girlfriend was not to happy because i was to busy reading the book and not talking to her.  it is one of those books where you are part of it and that when you are done at 3 in the morning you have dreams about it in your sleep and you can not wait to come home from school and work to read more and find out more.  like i said before what a book and that i would recommend it to anyone that loves action novels.",1134604800,,1638,3.930091185410334

The plot is somewhat predictable, but still seems fresh and exciting.  The stuntwork is really top shelf, and you walk away feeling like you wish you were Jason, but without all the headaches, memory loss and people trying to kill you.

I know I thought it would be pretty cool waking up with a few million, the ability to disable and disarm any assailant, speak several languages fluently and counterintelligence skills.  I'm sure that was a lot of the draw for many fans of this film.  The pacing kept you involved, yet made time to develop the characters.  The clever car chase felt fresh and even though it was a little over the top, it seemed borderline believable.  The fight scenes are fantastic (and the DVD shows the staging and training involved).

In fact, I think it is the ""realness"" of this film that made me get so involved with what was happening. Compare this with a Schwarzenegger flick where half the scenes are just so ""out there"" you roll your eyes and smirk and sit back to wait for the predictable happy ending. Here, there's real danger, real suspense and a plot to challenge you. Highly recommended!",1132790400,,704,4.3816793893129775
2331380,4,B0009WK5CW,"As an actor, Matt Damon is a little like the great Jeff Bridges, in that he keeps on quietly giving smart performances in movies that seem to tastefully resist the urge to grab you by the lapels and shout at you.  (One of these days, maybe Damon will do a comedic turn to match Jeff Bridges' brilliant, hilarious riffing as The Dude in the otherwise ridiculous ""The Big Lebowski."")

This is a tight, cool little action thriller with a lot of good, quasi-realistic fighting (so much more satisfying than bombastic Hollywood overkill, or the increasingly ludicrous flying and wirework that comes out of the Chinese martial-arts world).  The whole action sequence in the embassy is just perfectly rendered (even though it doesn't contribute much to the story).  So is the fight in the apartment.  Way to go!

Damon as Jason Bourne is pretty cool and convincing, and it would be nice if he could become the 'new James Bond,' but I doubt that will happen because: 1) the whole existential-loner-without-a-cause trip is just not as much fun as blowing up Doctor No or Ernst Blofeld; and 2) let's face it, 'Jason Bourne' just isn't nearly as cool a name as James Bond.

The one real problem with the movie is that the ostensible 'cause' of Bourne's amnesia is so rigged, so artificially constructed in order to place itself beyond reproach or criticism, that it's just not satisfying, and certainly not a good solution to the puzzle.  Then again, the puzzle is never really so important to this movie; it's all about the good performances, the tight filming, and those cool fights.

[BONUS OPINIONATED BLATHER:  The DVD extras contain some peculiar hand-wringing about 9/11, and the idea that our country's CIA-sponsored international subterfuge and so-called ""Black Ops"" were once considered evil, but are now just hunky-dory.  This is problematic.  I am certainly no apologist for terrorists, and I believe in a clear-eyed and strong approach to confronting global terrorism (hey, listen, like it or not, we DO need a CIA); but it's important to recognize that our whole ""Black Ops""-style policy was a large contributing factor to the current mess as it grows and spreads.  Let's at least own up to that, and acknowledge the complexity of things -- and as we work to make ourselves safer in the world, we might also try working harder to make ourselves less hated.  This doesn't mean we have to be weak and spineless; but it does mean we should take a good, hard look at plenty of stuff, and be honest about it.]",1131753600,,2507,4.8

Instead of being a CIA assasin who screwed up he was the legendary Delta tracking the infamous assasin Carlos for three years. It's a non stop page turner that kept me in the dark until the very end, the plot is that unpredictable. There's still a lot of slow areas that I find very annoying but that may be because I was to eager to find out what happened next. Now the only reason why I gave this book four stars was because Carlos aka The Jackle was an assasin in real life that the one in the books was based off of. However somethime after Ludlum wrote the story, ""Carlos"" was actually found to be the most pathetic assasin of his time. He messed up simple missions and took credit for kills he had nothing to do with just for the attention then he ended up as a scapegoat both the government and various parties lay blame on.

2331386,5,B0009WK5CW,"What can I say? My title says it all. The Bourne Identity is an action packed thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat as you try and piece together a mystery.

The Bourne Identity begins with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) floating unconcious in the middle of the ocean with two slugs in his back and a Swiss bank account number in his hip. His memory has been wiped clean, and does not remember anything further than two weeks ago.

As the story unfolds, Bourne learns that he can speak several different languages fluently, possesses amazing martial arts skills, and has tens of thousands of dollars. He learns also that an assassin is out to kill him. What happens next...well, you'll just have to watch it to find out what happens next--you won't be disappointed!

Recommended highly!",1125878400,,792,4.683453237410072
2331387,5,B0009WK5CW,"Have you ever seen a movie that was so astoundingly cool, so effortless, so neatly, wonderfully hip, that you wondered why other movie studios didn't somehow find a way to copy its ingredients and bottle it up, maybe weaponize it, releasing into the atmosphere every time they needed a blockbuster?

""The Bourne Identity"" is that kind of movie.

Director Doug Liman has taken all of the hyperkinetic and insanely cool techniques he used in the stylish ""Go"", and translated it over to the espionage genre, playing with the story of Robert Ludlum's best-selling ""The Bourne Identity"" to create a lightning-paced, sleek, intelligent and absorbing little spy-hunt that manages to out-Bond Bond himself and parallels (and nearly surpasses)Sydney Pollack's white-knuckled thriller ""Three Days of the Condor.""

In many ways, the story in ""Bourne"" is very close to ""Condor"": a confused protagonist and his reluctant companion find themselves pursued by a relentless, mysterious and deadly foe. When we first meet up with the movie's nameless protagonist (played masterfully by Matt Damon, who is becoming one of those actor who can charm the camera merely by sleeping---which, in fact, he does in this film)he is clad in a wetsuit, drifing unconscious in the ocean.

He is picked up by a Portuguese fishing trawler and discovers he was 60 miles off the coast of Marseilles in the Mediterranean, but how he came there is a mystery. Indeed, everything is a mystery to our hero, for he has amnesia: he can't even remember his own name.

He does remember a lot of other things, though: he discovers he can speak German, French, Italian, and Portuguese fluently; he can disarm and subdue two policemen in seconds; he knows how to drive a Mini Cooper *very* offensively; and he's a natural at staking out the opposition. Oh, and he has a laserlight pointer embedded in his hip, with the address of a Zurich bank and a numbered Swiss bank account.

A trip to Zurich raises more questions than answers though, as Damon finds a bank-box with a slew of fake passports (one of which has the name ""Jason Bourne"", his picture, and his 'residence' in Paris), a bundle of money in different denominations, and a gun. Worse still, he has now raised the attention of the police, and is now pursued by them and a series of well-trained and motivated killers who want Bourne dead.

To say anything more would spoil the fun of ""Bourne"", but it is rousingly well paced and intelligently directed. In a sense, ""Bourne"" is more Bondian than the Bond films, which are slick productions but often try too hard. ""Bourne"" also boasts excellent acting all around: Damon is great as a man literally searching for his identity while struggling for his very survival, Brian Cox racks up his third great character performance in a year (including his role as General Stryker in ""X-Men 2"" and his performance in ""The Ring""), and Chris Cooper is excellent as a CIA spook.

And then there is Franka Potente, one of the most beautiful women in film today, who was the white hot core of the eclectic ""Run Lola Run."" Potente, who plays a gypsy who helps Bourne, works perfectly with Damon, and the two have great chemistry together. Potente can say more with a quirk of her mouth and a single look than most actresses can with 5 pages of script.

The movie has everything you would want from a spy film: good villains, thrilling fight sequences, and a ripping chase through the streets of Paris in a vintage, beat up Mini Cooper. But best of all is Liman's ability to create a very real sense of menace and danger that is ratcheted up with every passing minute. Liman is very good at crafting this mounting atmosphere of peril, and shares much in common with Ridley Scott, particularly a solid feel for juicing up the danger-factor of otherwise innocnet locales.

Spymaster John Le Carre once wrote a book called ""The Perfect Spy"". In praise of Doug Liman, ""The Bourne Identity"" is The Perfect Spy Movie.

Eventually I realised that the movies were based off books, which I unfortunately didn't know before. I was told that the books are better than the movies. I tried them, and I have t agree.

He's somehow very good at anticipating trouble, and equally proficient at encountering and escaping.  Clues #2 & #3.  Of course, viewers are shown scenes of CIA honchos flustered by Jason's ""loose canon"" status.  Huge Clue #4.  What could Jason be????  The biggest flaw of this ""suspense-thriller"" is that we already know most of the answers within minutes of the opening.  Additionally...and I believe the lack of a soundtrack creates this problem...despite the action, there's not much thrill to this movie.  Assassins come after Jason and his new gal pal, and we pretty safely figure they'll escape them, and most of the bad guys will either die or be knocked out.  So, we're left with an amnesiac who can't figure out what seems obvious to viewers--even though he's got CIA-instilled intelligence instincts!!  He dodges repeated attempts on his life, and winds his way to a safe, open-ended ending that I will not reveal.

Bottom line:  The film garners two stars in that there is a uniqueness and a curiosity to the story.  The action, while not enough to keep me on the edge of my seat, did keep me mildly engaged.

Amidst hundreds of garbage Hollywood films, there are a couple that are actually pretty good, and this is one of them. Things get a bit predictable, but the end is slightly unexpected.

2331391,1,B0009WK5CW,"I think that this is possibly one of the first times I've enjoyed the movie more than the book.  It seemed to have potential at the start, but it quickly died when the pace of the book quickened to the lead character constantly dodging would-be killers.  And there were a lot of them.  My skepticism turned to disbelief when Bourne kidnaps a female to aid in his escape from even more people that are trying to kill him.  After threatening her life and inflicting pain on her mulitple times to keep her near, he's essentially turned her life upside down and convinced her she might die.  So how does she respond?  She falls in love with him.  Not sure if I've ever witnessed a quicker transition from total hatred for your potential killer to unconditional love (openly professing their love for each other on a routine basis).  In a matter of about 70 pages she goes from being utterly terrified of him and turning him into the police (or who she thinks is the police) to this: ""I should throw you out,"" he said.  ""I should tell you to get out of my life.""  She replies: ""It wouldn't make any difference if you did.  I wouldn't go, my love.""  Yeah, that's believable.

This book suffered because of Ludlums strange priorities.  When the book was fast paced, it was also quite shallow and superficial, barely holding my interest.  When the book focused more what should have been the interesting parts, it slowed down considerably, barely holding my interest.  And there is Ludlums thing with printing snippets of other languages.  Not a bad thing if you know what he's talking about.  But he did it with both German (which I speak) and French (lots and lots of French, which I don't speak) and it just left you confused and bored.

This was my second and last book by Ludlum.  The first book I read was less than impressive and this one was just laughable.",1124928000,,1857,4.536144578313253
2331392,5,B0009WK5CW,"The chief interest with this extended version is the new beginning and ending that can be played instead of the original.  Both versions are available so it is up to the viewer as to which to choose.  This is not a director's cut of the film since there is a message (or a disclaimer) that Doug Liman did not participate.  Prior to the start of the extended version is a discussion with the producer and writer as to why the extended version was issued and why, after September 11, the decision was made to tone down the film by removing explosions from the ending.  I found the discussion a bit long-winded and skipped out of it to the movie.

The changes to the film relate the action in a flash back.  Jason is in Greece searching for Marie when he gets a positive identification from a tourist and is drinking a bottle of Orangina when he topples over.  Cut to the start of the theatrical version of the film.  I have not read any of Robert Ludlum's books so I do not know how they compare to the movie.  However, a direct translation of the books to the screen is not possible: there is far too much to include.

I saw the Bourne Identity the weekend it was released and liked it from the start.  The intent of the film was to make a fast paced action movie but without creating sensational stunts that did not advance the story.  Still the fight sequences and the chase in the streets of Paris are extraordinary.  More important is the chemistry between the amnesic Jason and Marie, the hard-up German girl who agrees to give him a ride from Zurich to Paris.  As we get closer to knowing who and what Jason Bourne is, it is the developing relationship between Marie and Jason that holds our attention.

After watching the film to just about the very end, you can switch to the alternate ending. The new ending has Jason Bourne waking up with Brian Cox, who had ordered the murder of Chris Cooper's character.  Mr. Cox seems rather avuncular in this scene and informs Jason of where Marie is but lets him know that Treadstone is not more and he can do the odd killing job if he wants to.  The alternate ending is a little too neat for me and I don't think it adds anything to the film; interesting but not necessary.

Of the extra features, there is an interesting look at Robert Ludlum through interviews with the author and some of his friends.  We also get a look at some of the stunts, a professional diagnosis of why Jason Bourne developed amnesia and interviews.

2331393,4,B0009WK5CW,"I know what you must be saying. ""What's a book review doing up here?"". Well, sometimes you need a little change of pace. About a year ago my brother recomended the Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum . Mind you, I'm not what you call an avid reader. I seldom get past the first two chapters of something before I put it down and forget about it (you can thank the New Haven public schools and Ethan Frome for that). But the Bourne Identity was one of those rare instances that I thoroughly enjoyed a book from start to finish. Like I always say, if someone had recomended a book like this when I was younger maybe I'd be a better reader today.

Jason Bourne is a man without a past. Washed up on the French coast near death he is found by a doctor and treated for his wounds. He makes a full recovery save for one part, his memory. His past shrouded in mystery may be a secret too dangerous for him to discover.

The Bourne Identity is a great piece of probably what you'd call spy fiction. Mr. Ludlum's writing style is not only easy to read but it doesn't get bogged down in too many tedious and extraneous details. Everything is described using easily relatable terms. The thing I've always hated about reading was a writer's inability to get to the point of a chapter. Ludlum not only delivers but he also keeps you on your toes. He keeps the story compelling and moving, often at a break-neck pace. The action stays fast but not overwhelming at times. The story was full of twists in just about each chapter. New revelations abound. It's style of writing that made the book not only enjoyable, but practically a pleasure to read. At over 530 pages, the book doesn't feel like it's long and drawn out. Though there are times where the action was slow it wasn't without purpose. Almost providing a respite during a storm.

One of the things I liked about the story was the chess match between Bourne and Carlos. Though Bourne had no memory of who he was or what he was, he often reacted on instinct alone. Each manuevering, trying to out-do each other until the final climax. And when the end comes it was well worth the wait.

This is only my second review of a book, and it's a book that I actually liked. Having not seen the movie version and not being able to state the differences I'm not sure on how to end other than saying that if you like a fast paced story that won't become tiresome, then I highly recomend the Bourne Identity.",1124668800,,2438,4.363436123348017
2331394,3,B0009WK5CW,"Like many others, I read THE BOURNE IDENTITY because I enjoyed the movie so much.  The book is always better, right?  Well, not always.  Although THE BOURNE IDENTITY is an okay book, it is an example of the fortunately rare event of the movie being better.  The book does not have the swift pace and action of the movie and often bogs down in useless plot twists that add little to the plot but protract the book to an unnecessary degree.

For instance, in the movie, Bourne discovers the implant in his hip, goes to the bank, discovers large wads of cash and weapons, withdraws it, leaves and - BAM - onto the action.  The book, by contrast, has Bourne facing the intracacies of -GASP - an arcane banking regulation that prevents him from withdrawing his cash.  Not exactly the reason I read a political espionage thriller.

Bourne's relationship with the woman Marie is also rather tough to swallow.  After Bourne takes her hostage and really treats her rather roughly, she realizes that he is really a good guy and so her feelings of hostility turn to feelings of love instead.  Come on!  Even if her hostility were to abate, it is too much of a stretch for her to fall for Bourne that hard, that fast and under those circumstances.

The portrayal of Bourne's relationship with Marie is further undermined by the truly sappy language the author employs.  The text is full of references to ""my love,"" ""my darling,"" ""love me Jason, just love me"" and further such wince-inducing dialogue.  I am sorry, call me a purist, but the only times the words ""my love"" or ""my darling"" should appear in a book of this nature is when a man is talking about his feelings towards a particular piece of semi-automatic weaponry to get an assignment done. Over the top writing is, alas, not limited to Bourne's and Marie's love fests but pervades the entire book.  Bourne's flashbacks are written in a similar fashion.

Again, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is not bad.  In fact, it is pretty good.  But if a reader is looking for the excitement and action of the movie, well folks, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you will not find it here.",1124496000,,2122,4.5394736842105265
2331395,2,B0009WK5CW,"I've been a fan of the Ludlum novels for a long time, and have read them and re-read them several times.  It was always great fun to wait for the newest editions of the Jason Bourne/David Webb series.  I'm also a great fan of Matt Damon, and think he will go on to make many more wnderful movies.

Okay, here's the ""but..."" part of this review...

In the novels, and please correct me if I'm wrong, Jason Bourne/David Webb was an older man...in the final two, he was at least in his 40's, and his wife remained alive...the wife he picked up after the first Bourne novel.  She was a genius in economics and world banking if I recall.  The fact of his age played a great part in the novels.  He was also a man who had been altered to have facial features that didn't attract attention, and his disguises were simply done with a change of hair color, eye color, etc.  In the Damon version, you have Matt Damon, who always looks like Matt Damon, and he is more quick at just moving about and away, rather than blending, as the character in the novel relied more on the blend.  Jason Bourne/David Webb, as written, was a middle aged man, and that age also added to experience.  With Matt Damon, you're still looking at a high-tech ""kid"".  The Damon movies are good, and certainly packed with action, but they hardly follow the books at all.  An avid reader of Ludlum merely ends up going ""huh?""  The Damon movies are good, if you want an action-packed adventure that has very little to do with the character...and the Carlos figure in the ""Bourne Supremacy"" is almost non-existant, if not utterly confused.  If you avoid reading the books, and only watch the Damon movies, it's a nice enough romp.  If you have read the books, you will be disappointed.

The 1988 made-for-television movie with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith is highly superior, though a little harder to find.  It's true to the novel,  and doesn't have to rely on the new technological, scene-skating imagery of the Damon films.  It's sad that they didn't carry the Chamberlain film into the latter books, as ""The Bourne Identity"" done by this film was extremely well-done, and actually followed the plot line of the Ludlum novels.  Were Ludlum alive, I don't think he'd approve much of what Damon has done.

Instead of buying the current Damon versions, invest your money in the Chamberlain version, and then you can decide.

Matt Damon, again, will go on to do great things, he's very talented, but he was wrong for this part.  Perhaps if they had not titled them after the Jason Bourne series, they would just stand as good movies.  They're not bad to watch, but have very little to do with the novels.

2331397,3,B0009WK5CW,"Just about every Alfred Hitchcock film involved an innocent and everyday man caught up in some plot where he doesn't know what is going on or how to save himself from it.  The Bourne Identity modernises this method.  There's more action, and instead of an everyman in the lead role, we instead have a deadly assassin who doesn't know what he is because he has amnesia as a result of being shot and left for dead.  We follow Jason Bourne as he tries to figure out who and what he is while simultaneously trying to stay alive.

There are a lot of things to like about this film.  The mystery is interesting - we know more about Jason than he does himself, because we see his (former) employers at work, but that only helps keep the plot moving.  I especially like how the action scenes leap out of nowhere - the film turns from exposition or mystery solving to violent, brutish action in seconds.  Finally, the acting and characterisation by the main characters is great - Matt Damon is good as always.  He has a Harrison Ford-like quality of being able to appear frightened and highly competent simultaneously.  He is joined by Franka Potente (little known in America except from ""Run Lola Run"") who does a very good job in the thankless role of the innocent girl caught up for the ride.

The film straddles the line between mystery-thriller and action film.  The two parts blend seamlessly.  Unfortunately, there are a number of little things that pull the film's overall enjoyability down.  Most annoying is the plot surrounding the assassination attempts on an ex-dictator.  Firstly, the dictator is portrayed as a scenery-mashing, bug-eyed monster in a performance that is jarringly out of place in a film of subtlety.  Secondly, there is confusion surrounding the second assassination attempt.  We see in the newspaper the next day that it was successful, but we know (because we saw it) that it wasn't.  What's the dictator's game?  Is he faking his death to escape further attempts?  Is there a cut scene later on where we would have seen him assassinated?  The story leaves this dangling, and it's annoying.  Secondly, when Bourne bribes an official, he uses American money.  Since the action takes place in Paris, why doesn't he use Euros?  Because some people in an American audience wouldn't recognise them?  In a movie that prides itself on being smart, this is a glaring error.  Thirdly, there seems to be no rationale for the CIA to be trying to assassinate Bourne (as opposed to capturing him to find out what happened).

While you're watching the film, most would not notice these problems, but upon thinking about it afterwards, you feel like the film was only good and not great.  Another example - if the car chase had taken place in New York instead of Paris, and had Bourne's car been a Lincoln Towncar instead of a Mini, the car chase would not be very interesting.  But it's only on hindsight that these questions arise.  All-in-all, it's a fun and interesting movie, of high quality, as evidenced in the performances of Damon and Potente.

The DVD has a few extras like deleted scenes and a director's commentary.  The sound and video are good (as expected).",1124150400,,3181,4.739526411657559
2331398,4,B0009WK5CW,"In ""The Bourne Identity,"" audience favorite Matt Damon gets his hands dirty in an role that allows him retain all of his nice guy attitude but also kick tail with the best of secret agents ever portrayed on film.
Already having been made into a 1988 TV miniseries, this movie takes some liberies with the cold war plot of the original Ludlum novel but, its still one excellent thriller.
A man (Damon) is found floating more dead than alive in the sea by an Italian fishing crew. The captain, who knows a thing or two about surgery, tends to the man's wounds and removes two bullets and a microchip from his back.
After he recovers, the man realizes he has amnesia, with no clue to his identity other than a Swiss bank account found in the chip.
With no other leads to follow, the man travels to Switzerland and learns that the account is for a safety deposit box. The box contains an exorbitant amount of money, a gun and several passports and identities, one of which is Jason Borne.
Deciding to assume the Borne identity, the man barely has time to ponder his next move before a military squad and policemen ambush him.
As perfectly cast as Damon is for this role, the real star of the film is director Doug Liman, who hits all the right notes in setting up the drama and delivering with ""pulse-pounding high-octane action scenes."" Now if that isn't on the next run of commercials I don't know what is.
When Bourne begins his escape from his pursuers via a fire escape, Liman doesn't just settle on the quick hop down. Bourne has to scale down the building and Liman pans the camera at just the right angles to show that this isn't something you'd want to try at home...that is, assuming if you lived in a 12-story high-rise.
Since no espionage thriller is complete without a romance no matter how trite it may be, Bourne has to meet some unattached female in some manner.
While on the run, he meets Marie Krutz (Franka Potente), coincidentally enough, an unattached female in need of some cash. Well, cash Bourne has and he offers Marie $10,000 for a ride to Paris. Guess he doesn't trust the Metro either?
Thankfully Marie is not portrayed as the cliched tagalong sidekick and actually significantly helps Bourne in his search for his true identity.
Bourne maps out this exhaustive plan for securing some information from a hotel only to have Marie get it by flirting with the hotel attendant.
It turns out that Bourne's pursuers are none other than the CIA, or rather a CIA division spearheaded by Ted Conklin (Chris Cooper), who wants Bourne dead while keeping his supervisor (Brian Cox) in the dark as to the real reason he wants Bourne out of action.
Rather than prolong the mission any longer than necessary, Cooper sends three assassins to terminate Bourne and tie up the loose ends of the last mission Bourne was sent out to accomplish.
Liman introduces the assassins perfectly, having each of them speak as little as possible, and only putting them on camera enough to remind the audience that they are a prevalent threat ... right until Bourne encounters them, at which point they become as threatening as Freddie Prinze Jr.
Not that Bourne has it easy escaping the local authorities either. In one of the film's best moments, he and Marie race through the streets of Paris in a mind blowing car chase the likes of which haven't been seen on the big screen in quite some time. Meaning it's done in a manner that won't require audiences to suspend their disbelief to enjoy it.
The film's conclusion is a bit unsatisfying but makes sense given the way the story plays out.

I wanted to have it replaced, but I can't find a single way to communicate with anyone who can do anything about it.

I think what distinguishes this series is how realistic Damon makes it seem.  THere are no techie fixes or superhuman feats, just disciplined improvisation by the ultimate assasin.  Then there is his personal crisis, worked out in amnesia and his desire to start a new life, perhaps with a woman that he is endangering.  Finally, there are the shenanigans of the CIA, with its covert program gone awry and the brutal power maneuvers of the flacks trying to save the situation and their careers.

2331406,5,B0009WK5CW,"Spy movies never cease to do big business at the box office, but sometimes spy movies seem like they are all the same which doesn't necessarily affect the box office, but it does affect DVD sales.  There are several highly successful spy movies that have figured out how to keep things fresh for audiences; such as, James Bond, Spy Game, Mission: Impossible.  When it came time for the release of yet another spy movie, this time based on a classic Robert Ludlum novel, people were excited, that is until it was discovered that this adaptation would not have much in common with the source material, then skepticism set in.  However, unlike most cases where a movie tries to be as different from the book as possible this one works and was hugely successful, wowing audiences from day one.

""The Bourne Identity"", based on the first book in the ""Jason Bourne Trilogy"" by Robert Ludlum, is about a man who is found in the ocean and has apparently been shot and doesn't remember who or what he is and who or what did this to him.  Now this man must embark on a quest to not only discover who he is, but what he is.  He has martial arts abilities, highly aware of his environment, and is constantly haunted by memories that don't make sense.  Now, the people he worked for at the CIA believe he went rogue, and want to bring him in for questioning or silence him for good.  But upon discovering his name is Jason Bourne, and that he is now wanted by the very people he worked for, though he doesn't remember why, Jason is going to take the fight to the CIA and clear his name once and for all.

Superbly crafted thrill ride that never lets up until the credits roll.  Though it is drastically different from the novel it is based upon, ""The Bourne Identity"" still retains the spirit of the novel and sets itself apart in a way that doesn't alienate fans of the novels, but also doesn't require you to have read any of them either.  Excellent cast that is lead by Matt Damon, in a role that no one thought would fit him, but he proves otherwise.  Perfect direction from director Doug Liman (director of Mr. & Mrs. Smith).  ""The Bourne Identity"" is an excellent, intense spy thriller, that sets the bar for all other spy movies even higher.

2331408,5,B0009WK5CW,"Sometimes, a spy is a good thing to have in the city. In The Bourne Identity, a man named Jason Bourne is always trying to solve the crimes that people do by using DNA. This spy is always trying to help other people that are in trouble or in need of their belongings that were stolen from somebody.

 Some shows remind me of this book. Like CSI, they investigate the crimes that other people do and also investigate the things that these people left behind looking for stuff that could identify the person that did it. Furthermore, I think that the people in Zurich, Switzerland are good people to hang out with; but if you have committed a crime, you better watch out.

 I love this book because of the action. Like when J. Bourne was shot and police officer pitched in to help the chase of the killers. Also, the investigators investigate the crimes that the bad people do during this century.

 I would grade this book as a range of high school reading to collegiate reading. For this book, I think that you have to be very smart to read this book and learn a little French.

 Also, whoever is a rookie detective or spy should read this book, or if you want some excitement to your day.

 Jason Bourne also had to deal with a chase of two killers that actually wanted to kill this detective or spy. I don't know why he had to get involved in this case. Nevertheless, I think that Mr. Bourne does a lot of good to his society and to our world.

This is a great book about solo spies/assasins and their wonderful abilities to adapt. Spies and espionage are very fascinating subjects to read about because it is something that most everyone can only imagine or pretend about. Well, this book is ingeniously written about the life of a spy, with a very interesting storyline about the loss of Bourne's memory. Questions left unanswered like how do I know how to dismantle a gun? How do I know to fight like this?

I enjoyed the espionage and the story to the utmost degree. The only thing I could've seen less of would be the love story. I won't give away too many details but it seemed a little far-fetched to me. But then again, I'm never going to be a spy/assasin so what do I know?

The battle sequences are riveting and packed with twists and turns because of the abilities to use the enviornment that all spies must have, and the ability to blend into the background is perfectly done. Breaching enemy lines undetected, etc., etc. I could want nothing more from an espionage book, except a little less love.

If you were a die-hard fan of the movie, you may not like this book. The movie is completly different from the original book except for a couple things: Jason Bourne and memory loss.

As a student in high school I'm always looking for books that I can actually get interested in because, to be honest I don't like to read so I'm always on the look. Then my bother told me that the Born Identity books were really good and they were nothing like the movies. At first I was a little reluctant because again I don't read, but then my mom read them and she also said the same thing so I read it.

The main plot is that Jason Bourne has lost his memory and is trying to recover what he can't remember, plus he is now hunted by the police and assassins from an unknown source and everything points to Paris. The book starts off on a boat during a gun fight with an unknown man he gets shot and falls overboard, so the beginning pretty much will get you hooked and make you want to keep reading. He is floating out in the middle of the ocean unconscious when a fishing boat sees him picks him up and one of the fisher man just happens to be a doctor so he stitches the unknown man and saves his life and thus begins the story.

I like the fact that it is really nothing like the movie. In fact is a lot more detail in the first chapter than there is in the whole movie. It's like watching a whole different version of the movie.. I was surprised how different they really were. I would actually much rather read the book than watch the movie it is much more descriptive than the movie was and ever will be. For example Jason offered Marie money to take him to Paris but in the book he forcefully made her take him to Paris

For the most part I would have to say that this book is definitely a good book to read especially if you have seen the movie to see how different the two really are. It is a very good book especially if you like when there is a lot of action because that's the only way I'll even consider reading any books.

Maybe it was the quick tempo or the technical spy jargon that is thrown pell-mell at the viewer in the first few scenes, but in any case I was quickly confused. By the time I caught up with what Jason Bourne might have been and who he was trying to be, I had lost my desire to care.  When the film appeared again a few months later on Cable TV, however, I  forced myself to watch it more intensely. Whether it was the manner I employed or merely because I had been previously exposed, the second impression became a more rewarding experience: I was able to follow an intriguing, rather than distorted, plot; the European locations took on more relevance as they richly enhanced the authenticity of the story; and the action served as a prism through which I could better understand the character of Jason Bourne.  Eventually I realized that this is not, as I had initially believed, merely a movie peppered with special effects and computerized production to provide immediate visual stimulation.  It is all that, but it is also a film of multi-layered substance, not least of which is its complex, sympathetic main character, who, gifted in intelligence and expertly trained, must overcome all odds. Opposed alike by those he was sent to destroy as well as by his own leaders, he must survive by battling, not with special James Bond-like gadgets from another world, but, more believably, with his wits and guile. His amnesia prompts him to search for his identity, but that quest also forces him to question his very role as a hired assassin, perhaps, with the support of a woman he has serendipitously met, regaining his sense of humanity along the way.  We are ultimately, therefore, treated to a riveting, fast-paced, yet thought-provoking, odyssey.  Matt Damon, appearing more comfortable and confident than usual, ably plays the part of Bourne, complemented by brilliant supporting performances from Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brain Cox, and  Clive Owen, who, with only a few lines, brings a ton of presence to the ""Professor"" character.

I just wonder where these movie makers come from to change an entire story to fill their alloted time.

These last two new clips need to be accesed by pressing an icon which appears while the movie is playing, and the switch is cheaply done; lacking the original movies quality...
It would have been nice if the Extended version would have been made up without the PRESS THE ICON feature, and WHAT do they mean by EXPLOSIVE???? The only excitement and action is in the original movie.... nothing else.

2331427,5,B0009WK5CW,"THE BOURNE DOUBLE FEATURE

The Bourne Identity is a non-stop, action, suspense, thrill ride.

 In my opinion it is an excellent movie. (****) The director, Doug Liman , did an excellent job on this movie.

 The fighting and chase scenes were done so perfect. The fighting style that Matt Damon used reminded me of THE MATRIX, perfectly smooth and fast.

 My favorite fighting scene was when Bourne goes to his home in Paris and the other Black OP assassin swings and smashes through the glass window attacking him. Awesome hand-to-hand combat. When the assassin finds out he can't win by hand-to-hand he whips out a small arrow head blade, trying to get the upper hand. When Bourne sees this, he evens the odds, with a mere ball point pen and stabs the assassin quite a few times with his fighting technique. The assassin ends up losing and commits suicide.

 My favorite chase scene was the Paris Pursuit. (In the scene index) He tells Marie (Franka Potenta) that this is her last chance to go on her own, but she decides to stay and buckles up for the ride of her life.

 So, on this rainy day in Paris Bourne is driving a Mini Cooper, which in fact made this car famous, and out runs the Paris Police by dodging and doing 360s around other vehicle.

 The only way this scene worked was the fact that the streets were totally wet. They were so perfectly wet that it made this scene one of the best scenes in the movie.

 Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates action movies like me.

 The BOURNE SUPREMACY was also a great film. (***.5)

 In my opinion it was not as good as the first one because it had a different director (Paul Greengrass) and only one great scene.

 I think the director did a bad job on filming the chase and fighting scenes. It was like watching SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, where the camera was bouncing rapidly. And didn't capture the action very well.

 It was still a great film because, Bourne actually remembers and learns everything he had lost when he first got amnesia. Also, finishes the story.

 The best scene was the Death Chase, when he`s running from the Russian Police in a taxi cab he had stolen. Smashing into every vehicle, out running the Police and at the same time the assassin, who killed the love of his life, is chasing him too.

 When Bourne saw him he leads him down an underground tunnel with a lot of traffic. While smashing each other into the cement walls, Bourne then does a 360, grinding into the assassin's SUV. Bourne takes out his hand gun and blows out the front driver-side tire, causing the SUV to pull right in front of Bourne sideways. Bourne then puts the petal-to-the-metal and rams the SUV into a cement pillar.

 Now both vehicles are completely totaled. Bourne gets out of the cab limping towards the SUV, pointing his gun at the assassin and sees his pursuer lying on the steering wheel covered in his own blood. It looks to me like he was still alive and breathing. All Bourne does is just walk away.

 If I was Bourne I would have put a bullet in his head and called it a day. But it could have been a perfect story for another movie, making these films into THE BOURNE TRILOGY.

 Overall, I recommend seeing both of these films back-to-back to understand the entire story.",1107648000,,3258,4.4957410562180575
2331428,5,B0009WK5CW,"This movie is intense.  I can see why it and its sequel raked it up in the box office.  I remember walking out of the theater knowing quite well this was going to be a movie I would purchase.  No regrets paying the full price at the theater either.

The fight scenes are a breath of fresh air, especially after seeing so many ""Matrix"" copies in other movies.  I wouldn't be surprised if movie studios move more towards these straight forward fight sequences and away from the wire-fu.  The movie, ""Kiss of the Dragon"" with Jet Li, came out prior to this and the fight scenes are similar.  This makes the action even more tense because you see the characters more humanized.

The storyline is a gripper.  You have just enough information to know Jason Bourne is and has been a part of something.  Something big enough that people are desperately hounding him.  Plus, there are no lame dialogue quickies.  It's one of the more intelligently written action/thriller/drama scripts in my opinion.

The movie does move at a pretty fast pace and by the end you are wanting more.  Thankfully, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is now out.  Although, not as good, it still is topnotch for a sequel.",1107648000,,1178,4.6231884057971016

Jason Bourne is a killer with feelings. As portrayed by Matt Damon, is a film character better than James Bond. This first installment will keep you at the edge of your seat.

The producers and scriptwtriters decided to update the plot (it was written at least 30 years ago) bringing it up to our time. They succeeded.

It is a great idea: Jason Bourne does not know who he is, has lost part of his memory and struggles to reconstruct his past. During the process he falls in love with Franka Potente and things get really complicated.

All in all, is an excellent action movie. One star for the R rating, which shows sensitivity on the part of the producers and respect for their audience. 4 stars for acting, cinematography, direction and script.",1107302400,,919,4.7974683544303796

Matt Damon does a fine job playing the part of Jason Bourne, and after two movies now I can't see another actor playing the part. He  brings a believability to the role that the last string of James Bond movies sadly lacks.

This movie creates a character we would think the ultimate spy would be. While he is intelligent, he does not rely on gadgets or technology. He is quick with his wits and his fists and he is always cool while under fire or in danger. He is an ultra-professional and meticulous in his attention to detail.

I found the martial arts in this film refreshingly different and interesting to watch. Nobody goes flying into walls or gets knocked out with a chop to the neck. The fights are lengthy, brutal, and exciting to watch. The director also takes care to keep the camera back so we can actually see the actors doing the moves, something many modern movies are relutant to do because it's easier to do close-ups and fancy editing when an actor doesn't really have the skills.

Matt Damon, along with a fine ensemble cast, carries the movie and leaves us wanting more when it's finally over. A very smart thriller with enough action to keep your blood pumping, The Bourne Identity delivers.",1106265600,,1458,4.507575757575758

And nothing is really obvious, which is why I like to read novels; books that are predictable are boring.  This is not a boring book; it's fast-paced all the way through, and the character development is very good, even on the less significant characters.

And the way Ludlum puts you right into the culture and scenery is what makes the plot so suspenseful.  A great read.

I've read the 2 sequels.  I can't decide which is better: Identity or Supremacy.  But Ultimatum was a serious letdown.",1106265600,,668,4.554621848739496

The gimmick that made this book the most noteworthy of Ludlum's books is that the protagonist Jason Bourne is suffering from amnesia.  He awakens with no memory of who he is.  He follows clues and his periodic 'remembrances' and finds that he is a marked man and trained assassin.  He literally dodges bullets for the next 500+ pages.

The book moves quickly, has some great twists, and fantastic action sequences.  I can definitely see how this book inspired the movie, which aside from the amnesiac is nothing like the book.  The book also has the annoying love interest springing from absolutely impossible circumstances.  There are some loose ends to the story, but I'm sure those are dealt with in the next two Bourne books.  Still, if you like the action thrillers this should be high on your list.

Even though I thought Damon was well cast (indeed, seemed more able in this role than in some others he's played), my impression was that the screenplay was written primarily so that the director could simply string together the various action and special-effect scenes. In fact, from early-on into the movie that's exactly what is featured: car-chase and action scenes, distracting enough to make me lose sight of the plot as well. I came away disappointed, thinking this was crafted for immediacy at the expense of intrigue or drama. About 9 months later, however, it was a selection on one of the Cable TV networks, and this time I watched a little more intently, trying to discern if there was something I had initially missed. Wow! Second time around was apparently the charm for me: I got a chance to follow the events a little more carefully, and recognized that this was a much better film than I had first realized. Meanwhile, I also appreciated the value of the European locations which, this time, I could see provided more authentic substance to the scenes. Had I not been so quick to judge this as simply an Action-Jackson, I may have originally been more aware of its subtler aspects. Then again, perhaps it actually suffers from poor editing and requires more than one viewing. Whatever the case, after watching it again, I became a fan. While I still wouldn't place this in a 'classic' or 'great' category, I nonethless rank it as one of my recent favorites and now recommend it to others.",1105488000,,1578,4.679856115107913

The book goes into A LOT of details about minor things. I don't believe they could have made the movie exactly as the book. If they had, it would have been a 10 hour long movie. As it is, I loved it.

The Bourne Identity is a really cool movie because it's based on a tense and action-packed storyline. It's not like other movies with a plethora of action that looks phony and obviously made up. This movie is really interesting to watch because it starts out by grabbing your attention and then your attention is grabbed for the rest of the movie. The characters in this movie all do a great job of acting. Madd Damon is realistic and so is Chris Cooper, who acts as the aggravated CIA chief who wants to hunt down Bourne.

Surprisingly, the movie and the book share very few commonalities.  Jason Bourne has the same name, but otherwise it's two stories running in opposite directions.  The main antagonist in the movie is a CIA desk jockey at Langley, but in the book it's Carlos the Jackal - a character completely missing from the movie.

Marie is also much more then a not-so-bright brunette who can't get a Visa to the U.S., she an older and more mature international finance expert who helps Jason wire and hide the large stash of cash he carries out of the bank in Zurich.

The paper-thin plot of the movie amounts to nothing more then this:  Jason Bourne, a government trained assassin, botched a job, got shot in back in the process, and now has amnesia.  The CIA only knows that he failed to make an assigned kill and now wants him dead.  While trying to run from his former employer he must also try and discover his own identity.

Now, in the book, add this element:  Jason Bourne is NOT Jason Bourne, but an ex-military special ops agent who assumed that identity to trap the elusive international assassin Carlos the Jackal.  While trying to discover his own identity (of which he has two) he must also try to capture and avoid being killed by Carlos, who wants his dead, and try to re-establish contact with his former employer who can't understand why he seems to have turned, and who also wants him dead.

1. Bourne does use a woman-but he actually kidnaps her in the book

2. There was a bank in the movie-but he doesnt just walk into this high class bank in his dirt/bloody clothes and obtains millions of dollars-it was much more complicated than that.

3. There was a treadstone, but the head of treadstone was not killed by someone from treadstone.

The movie story line is poor as it stands on it's own. Very few things are tied together, we never really learn to care about/for Jason Bourne (why follow the series if you don't like the guy?).

I usually judge movies up to four stars and this is a great three star movies. (Lately I've been enjoying superb three-star movies like Spider-man 2 better than 4-star introspective movies hailed by the industry.)

The extras are junk and I'd advise against watching the alternative ending and the extended farmhouse scene. Both ended up on the cutting room floor for excellent reasons.

On the other hand, unlike Spider-man 2, this probably isn't a movie you'll want to watch over and over. Once you know what happens, the suspense on which this film hangs dissipates. So consider renting it before buying it. Still, it's fun to watch with people who have never seen the movie.

That does not make this a bad movie, just a movie that has very little in common with the book, so I was confused nearly from the beginning of the movie.

A man with two bullet holes is discovered floating in the ocean. When the man wakes up he has no memory. Why is he in the ocean? Who shot him? Who is he? He follows clues, including a clue to a bank account implanted under his skin, and learns that he may be Jason Bourne. However, he also learns that he may be someone else. He also learns that he may be an assassin.

The remainder of the movie has Matt Damon trying to keep alive and periodically killing people to do so. However, while his nemesis in the original Robert Ludlum novel was Carlos the Jackal, and he did his very best to avoid killing the spies from his side sent to kill him because they thought he might be a traitor, in the movie there is no Carlos and everyone with a gun he encounters is out to kill him. In substitute for Carlos the Jackal is Treadstone, which was a secret project to field highly trained assassins.

The action in this movie is reasonably good, with the requisite chases and fights. However, given that Jason Bourne was a highly trained and expensive assassin, I kept thinking that Treadstone would try harder to find and recover him rather than continually sending people with guns after him. But, just like watching a movie after reading the book, some action movies should not be analyzed, just watched.

Jason Bourne was written by Ludlum as a tormented man who hated the thought that he might be an assassin, in spite of the mounting evidence that he was a ruthless murderer. Jason Bourne in this movie is a cold-blooded killer. He is not tormented, just efficient. I struggled to see how Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) could take a liking to Jason. Jason did show mercy to a family and its children, but there was so little emotion in his face when he protected them that I wondered how emotionally involved he was in saving them.

As an action movie ""The Bourne Identity"" is above average. However, I thought Jason Bourne was too cold-blooded. I thought Bourne's motivations for killing were thin initially. After killing the first agent or two the others were definitely out to get him, but you have to wonder how much of that was his own doing. ""The Bourne Identity"" has lots of action, but very little compassion; lots of adrenaline, but very little heart.

Here we have a very capable and original director (Doug Liman, who did the excellent indie film ""Swingers"") and two very capable leads , in the always-sympathetic Matt Damon and the strangely fetching Franke Potente (of ""Run Lola Run""), and the gorgeous stage set that is Europe (specifically, Prague standing in for Zurich and parts of Paris, and Paris itself).  My only grumble is that we never get to see Potente in any state of undress, not even undergarments!  But that hardly sinks the movie in and of itself, mind you.

The fight scenes are mostly economical and entertaining---in part because Matt Damon employs the rarely-seen and reality-based Filipino martial art of Kali (explosive close quarters elbows, knees, trapping and grappling) as opposed to the usual absurd Hollywood bastardizations of Tae Kwon Do (fancy spinning jump kicks and other transparently useless fluff).  Liman shows a refreshing and admirable self-restraint in these stock action sequences, from the fight scenes to the requisite car chase to the one LARGE EXPLOSION near the end---unlike most action directors, he smoothly blends those formulaic elements into the story without turning them INTO the story itself.  Bang bang, chop socky whack, kaboom kabam---then he moves on instead of dwelling on the special effects.

The soundtrack is excellent and adds a lot to the movie's atmospherics---it made me glad to have invested in a decent home theatre sound system with a good subwoofer.

Some characters share the same names and positions, but similarities end there. The villain of the book doesn't even appear in the movie.

I've read Ludlum before. He likes to balance numerous plots that leave you wishing he would cut it down to 3 or 4. Well, here he is at his absolute best. You want more information. You need more information. It is a clever conceit to make the audience identify with Bourne by having him being an amnesiac. Since he is learning about himself at the same rate as you are learning about him, you come to like him and trust him. I normally just read and don't root characters on (Samwise Gamgee being a very notable exception) but I did with Jason Bourne.

The dialogue is for the most part fantastic especially when it comes to the plot. Ludlum is not the most romantic writer and his use of ""darling"" get tiresome quick. His pacing is precise.

Not to spoil too much-- but since the Jason Bourne of the novel was an un-official Vietnam Vet and things like cellphones and the internet weren't around-- the plot needed a little reworking.  Though I will admit that a showdown with Carlos would have been nice..

As for someone's misguided review about ""comedy""-- The character didn't jump out of the window to be funny.  It was a way to imply the extent of the ""behavioral software"" that had been programmed into the assassins.  Since his arm and leg were broken, and he had no weopons he refused to allow himself to be interogatted--by jumping out the window, he takes away information, and draws the attention of the police making Jason flee in hopes that the job can be finished by someon else.

--while not exactly the course I might have chosen...its not odd storytelling, bad comedy, or a misplaced concience...

Anyway-- It is a fun movie to watch, it tries to be smart, but doesnt beat you over the head with it, and the action that takes place is mostly economical, without too much gratuitous gunplay or explosions.

The Bourne Identity is incredibly solid. The visuals give us a very Cold War sense of the world and we see it through Jason's eyes - confusing, dangerous and at a number of times saddening. Damon does incredibly well using subtlety to understate his dual identities clashing with each other - his nature versus his training. However, Damon does not overact this and we are not hit over the head as many spy flicks have done in recent years (can you even call James Bond a spy flick anymore?).

The plot is fast-paced, and while you can say there are holes in it, we find ourselves not processing what just happened and trying to see what's going to happen next. The SteadyCam is utilized in a number of scenes very well and I catch shades of Michael Mann in Liman's camerawork. The documentary-esque realism is very much alive in this film and I have to say that Liman is an excellent director. I am very excited to see what he's got going next.",1097107200,,1225,4.415929203539823
2331463,5,B0009WK5CW,"I read this book a couple months after seeing the movie becasue I needed something to do. I am glad that I chose this book. I had never read anything by Ludlum before, but I plan to read many more of his books.

Reading this book was an awesome experience. You can actually feel the all the emotions that Bourne (or Webb) goes through. The Treadstone situation is an orginal and awesome idea. So is everything else in this book. All the characters and situations with Marie, Treadstone, Medusa, and Carlos are gretaly written. Everything is this book was made almost believable.

The actions scenes were incredible also. The confrontation in the treadstone house, the first fight on the boat, the graveyard with Conklin, and when Jason escapes the car and saves Marie, all are fun and exciting. This book is very easy to get into, and reading this will cause you to lose track of time. You just won't want to put this book down until you are through.

This book is fast-paced, easy to make sense of, and easy to read. If you were disappointed by the movie or not, or if you just want to dive deeper in the Bourne world, this book will take you there.",1097020800,,1150,4.466666666666667

All three books are disappointing both in their numerous plot twists and especially in the character dialogue. The main characters all sound like Mensa-Wannabees with every other line a new metaphor or witty reference. I regret purchasing the trilogy. The first movie is superior in every way.",1095811200,,537,5.033707865168539
2331466,5,B0009WK5CW,"Having seen the movie of the same title and really liking it I decided to try this book.  The movie takes some aspects from the book but both are absolutely different stories.  And as good as the movie was, the book is about 100 times better!

It starts out with some newspaper articles about some assassinations and the hunt for a man named Carlos.  That is just fodder to be stored away till much later in the book.  The story then jumps ahead to a man being shot and falling into the ocean.  He hangs on to some floating debris for life and is fished out unconscious much later by a fishing boat.

The captain of the boat brings the man to a ""retired"" doctor working in a small coastal town.  The doctor treats the patient for about 5 months in which we learn that the man has amnesia but has some incredible skills related to fighting and covert military type terminology.  He also had some face altering surgery.  The only clue to the man's identity is a Zurich bank account number that is contained on a piece of mircofilm that was surgically implanted in his hip.

The man makes his way to Zurich after pulling a ""con"" on a wealthy aristocrat to obtain money to create a false passport.  He seems to have memories of a hotel so he goes there and is recognized by the concierge who calls him Mr. Bourne.  With a name to go on, he heads to the bank and there learns his full name is Jason Bourne.  What he doesn't know is that his bank account has some special instructions to a network of killers, should anyone try to access it.  From then on Jason is a marked man, with faceless killers coming out of the woodwork after him.

Jason later winds up at a hotel and when he senses men are waiting to get him, he kidnaps a woman (Marie) from the hotel to use as cover.  He ends up keeping Marie to the point where she is also a target for the unknown killers so she is now in it together.  Jason ends up saving Marie twice and she realizes that he is not a crazed kidnapper, but a desperate man trying to save his life.  Marie decides to help Jason regain whatever he can of his memory and put a face to the man who wants him dead.  They piece together that the man is in fact Carlos, the super assassin mentioned at the beginning of the book.

The book is full of all kinds of great escapes and excitement.  It is also extremely interesting the tactics that get used by Jason to act as a ""chameleon"" to blend in to any situation and to be able to social engineer information to help explain more about himself and to learn the whereabouts of Carlos.

On top of everything, the covert US government operation that Jason was working for thinks that Jason has turned against them, so they are also trying to kill him.

This is a massive book that you cannot put down so try to read it on a long weekend that you have little to do!",1095811200,,2831,4.229050279329609
2331467,4,B0009WK5CW,This film has much to recommend it. The plot is interesting and tense. The acting particularly by Matt Damon is very strong. The locations in Europe are extremely intriguing. The film has an intensity about it that it is able to sustain all the way through with very few slow moments.

2331468,5,B0009WK5CW,"I read the Bourne Identity more than 20 years ago when it was first published.  After I saw the recent Bourne movies, I realized that I could not track events back to the book (relying on my memory, of course) so I decided to drag out the book (that's why I never throw away a book) and refresh my memory.  As one of the other reviewers pointed out, it isn't the same story.  Sometimes, I can understand why changes are made to transfer a book to the screen, but it seems that we are in an era when the movie maker simply wants to buy the name of the author and the title of a popular book so he can create the movie he wants and have a title that will draw fans.

The Bourne Identity is an excellent book that contains a story much more complex and interesting than the one told in the movie.  Ludlum painstakingly leads the reader through Jason Bourne's thoughts as he realizes that he has amnesia, has some very unusual abilities that are both impressive and frightening, and has people trying to kill him for some reason.  While they can convey the idea on the big screen, they cannot involve the viewer in the character's mind the way a good writer can with words (When I hear someone say, ""One picture is worth a thousand words"", I am always tempted to say, ""Not if the right person writes the words"").

So if you saw The Bourne Identity and liked it and thought it could have been even better if it had a good story, YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK.",1094860800,,1448,4.243636363636363
2331469,4,B0009WK5CW,"The spy-film business is alive and well, despite all of its setbacks. This one is exciting, well paced, and very enjoyable.

Someone (Bourne) is found floating at sea, with two bullets in his back and a mysterious message surgically implanted. He wakes up with no idea who, where, or even what he is. He has some skills - languages, and more ominous skills that seem to scare even him. And people are trying to kill him.

OK, the ""amnesia"" plot has been used until it's almost used up. This is really a chases'n'action film, and needed something to get it started. Once the amnesia premise jump-starts the movie, it moves forward very well by itself. Matt Damon did a good job in the title role, except maybe for being too much of a nice guy for the history that eventually catches up to him.

I don't normally pay a lot of attention to DVD extras. This has one nice extra, though: a choice of two start and end scenes. The theater edition was good enough, but the extra version was more interesting. It was also more conducive to sequels.

If you want a spy/action flick, try this one out. I don't think it will ever become a classic, but it's still good.

The plot of the story didn't have holes in it (except for why Bourne was trying to kill Wombozi. We all were a bit confused by that part). It was a good blend of action and suspense, which I like in the film. Perhaps one day I'll read the book this film was based on. I'll be looking forward for the Bourne Supremacy on DVD (I'm the kind of person who likes to wait for a film to come out on DVD unless I really want to see it in theatres). It was even comical sometimes, especially around the ending fight between Bourne and Conklin's agents.

The acting was well-done. Matt Damon is superb as Jason Bourne; he delivers an awesome performance that really tells you what kind of character he is. Clive Owen does a good job as the Professor; he did really well in the sniping scene. And Chris Cooper as Conklin...you gotta love this guy. Outstanding work, Mr. Cooper. It's a shame that Conklin won't be in the next film...I wanted to see more of that guy.

2331474,5,B0009WK5CW,"This is a very different thriller, with one of the most intriguing characters I have seen in a thriller.  A body is pulled from the ocean with a couple of bullet holes in the back.  Amazingly, the man is still alive.  He is treated by the ship's physician and slowly brought back to health.  The only problem is that he lost his memory.  The physician finds a metal nugget in the man that projects a bank safety deposit box number.

With no clue as to who he is, the man goes to the bank and is able to get to the box with his thumbprint as his identification.  Inside the box he finds a slew of passports, currency and weapons.  Each of the passports is under different names.  He uses the one that says Jason Bourne and when he uses it for travel, the immigration computer sets off a whole bunch of alarms to some CIA operatives that very much want him dead.

At a US embassy, Jason eludes his assassins (through some highly refined combat techniques and climbing skills) and asks for a ride from a lady he saw at the embassy.  She takes him, unknowingly putting herself in danger.  The two of them need to unravel Jason's mystery as to who he is, why he has the skills that he has, and why are the government agents trying to kill him.

Jason and the woman (Marie) head to Paris to an address that Jason lived at.  There Jason is attacked by a hitman who has photos of both Jason and Marie that were taken back at the embassy.  Suddenly Marie realizes that she is stuck with Jason fighting unknown enemies, just to stay alive.

The movie is quite different than the book of the same name but is excellent nonetheless.  Matt Damon appears well cast and all the CIA operatives are excellent as well (Julia Styles plays one of them).  The actress that plays Marie does a passable job and there seems to be a good chemistry that evolves between her and Damon.

Even if your a fan of the Bourne identity, you can avoid this disk, and get the original release which I feel was given better treatment then this rushed edition.

The book is fantastic and (although Ludlum was a producer of the movie version, and therefore must have ok'd it) such a better story than the movie. In it you meet Jason Bourne, a lost man with a lost memory.  You follow him as he looks for and finds clues to his true identity.

It's as suspenseful as they come.  This hefty tome was one of those I absolutely inhaled.  I'm a woman, by the way.  If that matters.  I was thrilled, enchanted, excited, and impressed by this book.

2331478,3,B0009WK5CW,"Who is Jason Bourne? And more importantly, will you care by the finale of this limp action flick? Starring Matt Damon as a guy with no past and no identity, ""The Bourne Identity"" strives to be a thinking man's action flick and only ends up being another mediocre shoot-'em-up, with Damon's earnest performance as one of the few highlights.

A man (Matt Damon) is found floating in the ocean, and is picked up by a rickety fishing boat. He has no memory of who he is, or why there are a couple of bullets lodged in his back. He sets out on a journey to find out who he is, uncovering a gun, the name Jason Bourne, and a lot of money in Zurich. Unfortunately, very deadly people seem to creeping out of the woodwork to kill him.

He picks up a rather clueless traveller (Franka Potente), who agrees to drive him to where he wants to go. (Why doesn't he drive himself?) But as Bourne keeps uncovering clues about his past, he learns that his past is as an assassin -- and it seems to be his old boss who now wants him dead, gone and forgotten. Only Bourne doesn't plan to go down without a fight. (Or a sequel film)

Don't worry, James -- ""Bourne Identity"" doesn't threaten the Bond franchise. It feels like a bunch of loosely strung-together action scenes with a lot of cinematic flourishes. ""Wow! Check out THIS cool scene!"" director Doug Liman seems to be constantly saying. But unfortunately it makes for a rather dull action flick -- and definitely not a smart or suspenseful one.

The scriptwork and direction are pretty mediocre. Liman adds little to the proceedings, although some of the camerawork -- such as the car bumping down a staircase -- is fairly thrilling. Unfortunately, he uses his little tricks too often, and soon you'll be craving something a little slower and more complicated, rather than a string of action flourishes.

And the script itself feels half-baked. More character development and ""quiet moments"" between action scenes would have brought everything to life. But the few moments of character development are hurried, so we can see Damon beat up a few more thugs. Suspense? Not much at all -- the Bourne identity is painfully obvious.

Matt Damon does seem to be giving it his best as Bourne. While his acting is so-so, and his character feels incomplete, he does look like he's giving it his all. Franka Potente is forgettable as the token love interest; all Marie does is go to bed with Bourne, and react to every crisis by tottering around with her eyes and mouth wide open. And Julia Stiles fans had better not blink, or they might miss her role.

""The Bourne Identity"" strains to be a smart, sexy, tightly-wound thriller, but only becomes an an average wad of summer shoot-'em-up brain candy. Bourne may have found his identity, but the identity of his film isn't worth finding.",1092787200,,2814,4.627254509018036

2331501,4,B0009WK5CW,"Wow! Where was I when this flick came out?  It is a great spy movie equal to the best of the classic Cold War spy movies.  I guess I soured on spy movies after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  In their quest for new villains, Hollywood made big business the new boogey-man.  Oh, um . . . unless you are a foaming at the mouth liberal, big business does not make a very good villain.  How many post-Cold War movies I have seen where some corporate evil businessman attempts to wreak havoc on human kind for the sake of profit.  What is totally unbelievable about these movies is that very rarely can a leader move hundreds, if not thousands of people to do his bidding without an ideology behind it.  People just will not kills thousands of people, put the human race at risk, let alone putting ones own life at risk so some greedy corporate suit can make more money.  History has shown that people seldom will risk their lives so their boss can make more money, but they will willingly lay down their own lives for a religious or political ideology to motivate them.  Hitler got men to kill millions in order to purify the white race; Moslem extremists get young people to strap bombs on themselves and blow up innocent women and children in order to reclaim Palestine and kill Jews; The Crusaders willing gave up their wealth and lives to liberate the Holy Land from the Moslem occupiers. It takes ideology to motivate people.

The Bourne Identity avoided this pitfall by focusing in on a event that one could believe in- the CIA attempting to kill and African despot who was going to publicly  identify CIA operatives.  Matt Damon was superb for the part. No, he does not look at James Bond, that that is the point- He is an ordinary looking guy.

A car chase, good stunts (including the one at the embassy), strong story line, great acting and good direction summarize the movie. A true thriller.

2331505,4,B0009WK5CW,"""The Bourne Identity"" takes the premise from the marvelous novel by Robert Ludlum and adds a distinctive modern film twist to it. In many respects, Bourne (Matt Damon)is the anti-Bond; he begins as an assassin but, robbed of his memory and hunted because of an assassination he failed to carry out, Bourne tries to stay alive as other assassins are sent to eliminate him. In the meantime, he tries to discover who he is and why they're trying to kill him. He meets Marie (Franka Potenta from ""Run, Lola, Run"")and forces her to drive him to the apartment where he lived. While she's frightened, she's drawn to this mysterious and hurt soul.

 Director Doug Liman (""Go"") and screenwriters Tony Gilroy (""Proof of Life"", ""The Devil's Advocate"") & W. Blake Herron (the forthcoming ""Mr. Ripley's Return"") have fashioned a marvelous spy thriller with a number of marvelous set pieces including the infamous carchase with the minis. Visually striking with strong performances by tne entire cast, ""The Bourne Identity"" is a great way to spent an evening.

 I wouldn't, however, recommend the re-release unless you haven't purchased the film previously. The alternate opening isn't quite finished and the alternate ending was available on the previous version on DVD. The biggest drawback, though, is the fact that this edition doesn't have an audio commentary track by director Liman. While there are a number of extras (they are highlighted in the amazon.com list of new features) here that are new, this really isn't all that different from the previous version. If you haven't seen the movie yet, this edition does have a free ""ticket"" to the sequel so that might entice someone who has rented but not purchased the movie before to get this. Having seen both editions, the transfer appears to be the exact same digital transfer from last year.

 A great spy thriller of the type Hitchcock might have made if he were 35 years old and just starting out making movies, ""The Bourne Identity"" is well worth purchasing but if you bought it before you may want to seriously reconsider getting this edition.",1091404800,,2093,4.931818181818182
2331506,4,B0009WK5CW,"I have never been a Matt  Damon fan. For some reason, he just never blipped on my radar screen until I saw The Bourne Identity in the theaters two years ago. My new found crush for him has now been solidified with The Bourne Supremacy. I realized he is such a good actor who can play an action character with humanity and be athletic enough to pull off the action moves with ease.

I think the Bourne series overall is a smart intelligent piece of filmmaking with a solid screenplay and razor sharp caliber actors. Cooper and especially Cox are my favorite. I enjoy the relationship between Bourne and Marie. Call me a romantic mush but how could they not have went with the alternative ending. The theatrical ending never made sense to me. It came off stiff and implausible. Bourne has been searching the globe for the woman he loves. When they finally reunite, they act as if they're old friends catching up, giving each other nice generic hugs. The alternative ending makes more sense. The raw passion and hunger they feel for each other comes through. It marks the incredible ordeal they've both endured. He was so incredible in that screen, he really acted a man who wanted to devour his woman.

For those who are not romantic like me, the Bourne Identity mainly focuses on the spy thriller that is heavily character driven and it will not disappoint. If they continue to make more films I hope that stick to the commitment of making a great screenplay with a director who can pull it off and not turn the series into garbage like James Bond.",1091318400,,1547,4.557553956834532
2331507,4,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne Identity is a well made thriller about a covert agent who's 'malfunctioned' and wakes with amnesia. Matt Damon, who plays Jason Bourne, aka several other names, finds himself unable to remember who he is and at the same time aware that he's got a few 'skills' that seperate him from the rest of normal society.

Set on location in Switzerland and France, this well-paced story moves right along. Along with Damon there is Franka Potente who he meets as he attempts to speak with someone at the U.S. embassy in Zurich. Offering her money to drive him to Paris in search of his identity, she accepts with reservations. And so the chase begins. Other agents like Bourne are called into action to find him and a series of chases and assasination attempts ensues.

The characters playing these Bourne-like agents aren't really delved into, which is a shame. This also calls to mind the major weakness in the story- the U.S. government controllers who are after him. The role of 'controller' is stereotypically played throughout and it's perhaps the only weakness in the movie.

The Bourne Identity isn't great movie-making; what it is is good entertainment. A good cast, script and well paced action scenes move the plot along at a steady pace. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope to see its sequel very soon.",1091145600,,1312,4.79646017699115
2331508,5,B0009WK5CW,"I know, this book deserves a review all on its own merits - but let me speak first to the fact that the movie released last year with Matt Damon just simply did not do this book justice. What they did was take a compelling character, extract him from the plotline which makes him so compelling, and build a movie around him. If you thought Jason Bourne was a bad-ass character in this movie, and you enjoyed the pace and action of the movie - well, you have only begun to tap into the true excitement of Jason Bourne as he is in Ludlum's novel. I think the movie took Jason out of context to make him more current - as the book was originally published in 1987 and some of its politics and settings are dated. But I would argue that rather than dating the story, these facts lend a strong sense of time and place to the story that actually helps recommend it - and aid its mystery.

The initial plot of the movie - a man waking up amnesiac after being shot and left for dead in the Mediterranean Sea - is the same. And it is true, that man must seek knowledge of himself to explain his extraordinary abilities - in hand-to-hand combat, weapons assembly, language, and espionage. But what is not communicated so well in the movie is the true anguish and self-examination that must be undertaken by the Bourne character - what drives him unstoppably to determine who he is. Bourne is not a fierce killer - and yet can kill fiercely. There is a strong mystery and a burning need in him to find the truth - as a reader, you feel strongly attached and sympathetic to Bourne - mostly through the device of Marie, a much stronger character than in the movie - who is his partner in determining his identity.

Not only is he being pursued by his own intelligence agency - which subplot contains infinitely more subtlety than in the movie - but he is being tracked by the world's deadliest assassin as well - Carlos the Jackal - who is, all evidence seems to show, his fierce rival. As he circles in on Carlos, Carlos is circling in on him - and so is worldwide intelligence. Jason must determine who he is and what his past is - and has only so much time to do it - this sets the driving pace of the book.

Ultimately, what we have is a three-part cat and mouse game, with Jason always just one step ahead of everyone else. Is he an assassin? Is he an undercover agent whose cover is so deep he can't differentiate himself from it anymore? There is no time or luxury to decide - the novel moves along at a breakneck speed until we ultimately find out - almost too late - what the Bourne Identity truly is.

This book far exceeds the movie based on it because of its tightly drawn characters, far superior plot, and the truly deft way that Ludlum has woven his story into world politics and great international locations. Ludlum is a great writer of thrillers - as his decades of book sales attest - I would urge you to pick up this book and give it a weekend - it will reward you far beyond the 2 hours you got out of the movie.",1091145600,,3020,4.2560975609756095

2331510,5,B0009WK5CW,"Who knew?

Because there was all kinds of buzz about The Bourne Supremacy, I decided to watch The Bourne Identity simply out of curiosity. I had never seen Matt Damon in any movie, and was not expecting a whole heck of a lot since I obviously live under a rock and did not realize just what a phenomenally talented actor Damon is.

Surprise. This movie is incredibly riveting from start to finish, a true tour de force, and I don't even like spy movies as a rule. The acting is taut, true and not a bit overdone as Damon plays a hired assassin who wakes up on a fishing trauler off the coast of Marseilles with no memory of who he is and what he does for a living. He does not know why he is proficient in several languages, why there are multiple passports, international currency and a heavy duty gun in his effects, and why he has a sixth sense tuned in to danger from bad guys.

And bad guys there are, as the CIA et al try to bring him down as a trained automaton gone haywire.

Damon runs the gamut of emotions from wary terror to fear to acute frustration to sensitivity (yes, there is a girl, and no, there is no gratuitious sex) in a way that lets him kill in cold blood and still remaine the hero.

2331511,1,B0009WK5CW,"If you already own ""The Bourne Identity"" on DVD, I reccomend avoiding this DVD. This is not a true extended version. Worse, a stupid opening scene and barely different alternatve ending are NOT FINISHED QUALITY: raw, poor sound, terrible and distracting! Just terrible! Then, they have to be accessed by selecting an icon while your watching the movie, instead of a seamless extended directors cut that we are led to expect.

 If you don't have this movie on DVD, get it, otherwise, there is absolutely no reason to buy this DVD. This is a real slap in the face to consumers! Must have been a rush job to get something (anything) out in time for the Bourne Supremacy...",1090713600,,669,4.661016949152542
2331512,3,B0009WK5CW,"First, I rate the MOVIE Bourne Identity and the older Collector's Edition DVD both as 5-star. I expected the Extended Edition DVD to include all in the older Collector's Edition DVD AND MORE. What you get with the Extended Edition DVD is a FREE TICKET (EXPIRES AUGUST 8th) to MOVIE Bourne Supremacy and a weaker DVD release that is largely a promotion for the new movie.

What you LOSE (Extended Edition DVD versus Collector's Edition DVD):

an extended farmhouse scene; DTS sound; Doug Liman's informative Director's Commentary track.

What you DO NOT GAIN (Extended Edition DVD versus Collector's Edition DVD):

the SAME alternate ending IN ROUGH, GRAINY QUALITY as in the deleted scenes of the Collector's Edition; the SAME deleted/extended scenes (except for the ADDED alternate beginning noted below and the OMITTED farmhouse scene noted above); the SAME Extreme Ways music video by Moby and the SAME DVD-ROM access to web site; no featurette whatsoever providing director Doug Liman's comments. (Did Liman tick off producer Frank Marshall or did he want to distance himself from this so-called upgrade by Universal?).

What you DO GAIN (Extended Edition DVD versus Collector's Edition DVD):

a FREE TICKET (EXPIRES AUGUST 8th) to Bourne Supremacy movie; pain-in-the-arse indirect PLAY THE MOVIE via a Play SUB-menu to select theatrical vs extended version that STILL forces you to use MANUALLY your DVD player's ANGLE button WHEN THE ALTERNATE ANGLE ICONS APPEAR ON YOUR SCREEN to access the bookended alternate beginning/ending version (both footages in UNFINISHED QUALITY that somewhat compromise the vendetta premise of the Bourne Supremacy); Special Features includes these SAME UNFINISHED alternate beginning and ending in isolation with producer Frank Marshall's mea-culpa that this less-than-explosive footage was a post-production C-Y-A due to 9/11 that test audiences ultimately bounced anyway; some worthwhile featurettes regarding Robert Ludlum, CIA practices from retired CIA operative/film consultant Chase Brandon, and a real psychologist's profile of Jason Bourne; a worthless transition promotion fluff to the Bourne Supremacy movie.

VERDICT: If DTS sound or Director Commentary tracks matter to you, DO NOT UPGRADE (yeah, right, upgrade); stick with or buy the older Collector's Edition DVD. If you don't already own the Collector's Edition or these factors don't matter and you intend to use the free Bourne Supremacy movie ticket BEFORE AUGUST 8TH, go with the Extended Edition DVD But shame on you, Universal for your promotional UPGRADE hogwash!!!",1090713600,,2575,5.50379746835443
2331513,1,B0009WK5CW,"Okay, let me start out by saying I think the Bourne Identity is a great movie. One of my favorites. Needless to say, I already owned the DVD that was previously out. Then along comes the ""EXPLOSIVE EXTENDED"" edition. Awesome! I don't ever upgrade movies when an extended version comes out later, but, I had to make an exception this time. Well, never again.

 I think we can all agree that when we hear the term ""extended edition,"" that means that the movie itself is different-it's longer, has some added scenes, etc. Well, I'm afraid that's not the case here. What we get instead are an ending and beginning, (which you can tell by the quality of the film and the sound effects weren't even finished!!!!!) that add maybe a total of 5-6 minutes, and have to be accessed by selecting an icon WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING THE MOVIE!!! The movie then cuts to throw in the incomprehensible beginning scene (which may not work on all DVD players the warning said). At this point I said forget it, I'm just going to watch the theatrical version.

 I have never felt so ripped off by a movie studio before. If you already have it, then by all means, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. If you don't have it, well, get it because it's a great movie and go see the sequel courtesy of the studio with a free ticket.",1090713600,,1288,4.421940928270042
2331514,2,B0009WK5CW,"On the back of this paperback edition, one review highlight reads, Ludlum stuffs more surprises into his novels than any other six-pack of thriller writers combined. True. Every 10 to 20 pages is yet another plot twist. At well over 500 pages, that's a few too many.

I really tried to like this novel. I enjoy mystery novels and really liked the film Bourne Identity, so I figured I would enjoy this book. Well, it was enjoyable, certainly in the first third, but after a while, it dragged on to an awkward conclusion. This book is jam-packed with plot turns, new character introductions, and lots of repetitive inner-monologue.

I was really shocked. With Ludlum's reputation, I really expected a tight thriller. It was anything but. I grew tired of the yet-another-plot-device about 150 pages before the conclusion. Which for me, was the worst part...

The ending is very unfulfilling. The books leads up to a climax, yet... well, I won't ruin it for you, in case you decide to see for yourself. I'll just say this - GIGANTIC loose ends (one almost impossible to believe), which left me wanting. So...

 I picked up Bourne Supremacy to see if Ludlum begins to tie the loose ends up. After all, I am aware this is the Bourne Trilogy. But... nope. Bourne Supremecy - brand new plot, without trying to clear up the unanswered questions of the first book. I had to stop reading that book for fear of more unfulfilled plot promises.

It reminded me of the sprawling plot twists in the endless X-Files series, which ultimately petered out without conclusion. With so much invested, in this case 535 pages, you've got to give me an ending. Jeez.

The movie, it should be stated, is very different, tossing the entire (main) Carlos-the-Assassin plot, for a very tight, streamlined film that BARELY resembles this book. Which is good for the movie. I haven't seen Supremacy, so I have no comment, but I've heard from friends that it strays even farther from the novels.

Wait... The movie is BETTER than the book?! Yep. No one's more shocked than me.",1090627200,,2044,4.738028169014084
2331515,5,B0009WK5CW,"I fail to understand the negative reviews of this film. Two reviewers called it ""boring"" and took to timing the lengths of the action sequences.

 I suppose these types of reviews are inevitable in this day and age of non-stop violent video games and those ridiculous John Woo conflagurations.

 This film is however anything but boring. I don't exactly recall then the book was first published but I read it when it was new and felt it raised the bar for spy stories. Remember that this book is at least 25 years old. Updating the story and making changes to better fit a film format is not only understandable but should be expected, even demanded.

 Anyway, I rate this movie as excellent in almost every way. While it may not be exactly like the novel ( why would anyone want that anyway?) I think it reflects the spirit of the novel wonderfully.

 I was very impressed with Damons portrayal of the amnesiac assasin and the director played out the scenario of discovery as well as anyone could ever hope for. I thought the action scenes were exactly what I would have wanted to show the skill and programming of a Treadstone killer. No these were not over-choreographed John Woo silliness that go on and on. Bourne gets the job done quick, the other guy is down NOW.

 Look carefully at the sequences. When Bourne was threatened or went into action he did it automatically amost robotically like he was eexecuting a subroutine and came right out of it when it was over. I thought this was perfectly done and helped the viewer understand better what the Treadstone project was.

 The apartment scene in Paris is one of my favorites. I loved seeing Bourne and Marie acting like two high school kids alone for the first time disvcovering each other and not sure what to do next, thne Bourne popping into his killer/fighter mode instantly, put the attacker down then get the girl out. Potente for her part played it out so well, from being coyly interested to fear, to fright, to shock and then recovery. Very realistic in my opinion. Just the way you might expect a real person to react in that situation.

 I though the chase scene was likewise realistic, and I loved it when they parked the mini after alluding the last policeman. Watch Marie's range of facial expressions when Bourne is telling her what they have to do next. I loved it. Potente did a marvelous job of communicating real feelings with just her face a few short syllables.

 Director Liman also did an excellent job of brining out the mystery slowly, where each answer only led to more questions. It kept the viewer guessing all along.

 This movie was extremely well done and a fine tribute and introduction of the Bourne saga to the big screen.

 Ignore those shallow reviews that only want more kicks, punches and rounds expended and fight scenes laid out like a line dance at a disco. Leave that brainlesss nonsense to John Woo movies. This is a thinking persons spy movie.

 Plus I loved the ended. Wonderful. Maries last line is absolutely priceless.",1090627200,,3026,4.637898686679175
2331516,1,B0009WK5CW,"Some other guy called this movie the boring identity, he couldn't be more right.  First of all there is about 3 mins and 30 secs of action in the entire movie.  There are 3 fights which are about 20 secs long each, and they're all the same bourne grabs one guys arm punches the other guy in the face then punches the first guy then maybe if your lucky he'll throw a kick completing the fight.  The so called car chase is like 2 mins and involves a mini cooper doing 20 mph the whole time, turning in alleys, goin down some stairs, then making some kinda get away in the subway, thats it, there no crash or explosion or even high speed, some guy called this chase unforgettable, maybe because its so short and uncomplicated that its not hard to forget.  The story as been done before, but its kind of interesting, but not enough, the performances are barely above mediocre, esspecially matt, and the action sucks(seeing as how ive been in better fights and droven faster and better then damon did in possibly what could be the worst car chase ever) so i give the movie a 1 out of 10 for trying to be a good action movie and having one kinda cool explosion(that really didn't make sense, why did a shotgun shot in the side door make the car explode don't understand they put the gas tank in the door maybe?), anyway don't waste your time, hopefully the sequel will be better but i doubt it.",1090627200,,1388,4.326923076923077

2331518,4,B0009WK5CW,"How nice to watch a spy movie where, although Jason Bourne certainly is at the top of his game, it?s not a gadget filled James Bond wannabe. This is a credible film, with excellent acting by both Damon and Potente, and a storyline that is fresh, original, and keeps your eyes glued to the screen.

This was a rare film indeed from a revenue standpoint. It grossed $121 million in the U.S. theatres, and so many thought it was a failure, as it was hoped to be more of a blockbuster and bring in closer to what its total *worldwide* gross was - $214 million. Although $121 million is hardly a failure. HOWEVER, the movie cleaned up when it became available on VHS and DVD, bringing in ?Video Revenue? of $93 million dollars ? 77% of what it did in the theatres. To a geek like me, that?s fascinating. I?ve looked and looked, but haven?t found another film with similar numbers.

While many say that the reason the sequel is being made is because of the explosiveness of the VHS/DVD sales (to draw a comparison, Spider-Man had ?Video Revenue? of $112 million, compared to a box office take of more than $400 million ), and that statement is true, it?s unfair.

2331519,5,B0009WK5CW,"I had serious doubts before seeing this movie. I just didn't think Matt Damon could pull off a good action hero role.
BOY WAS I WRONG.
Damon's performance is one of the best ""action hero"" roles since Bruce Willis in Die Hard. The plot is nothing new, probably because it's been copied from the original Bourne books so many times before that it's already predictable once it gets to the big screen. It's forgivable though, as the action sequences are tight and frantic, with decent enough acting and dialogue in between to make it more than ""just"" an action movie.",1090368000,,564,4.65

The 'explosive' new beginning and ending were NOT, and really add nothing to the movie (I won't 'spoil' the 'surprise' for those die-hard fans). Plus they couch the reasons for excluding them from the theatrical release in some 9/11 mumbo-jumbo that was not clearly defined enough to understand. I think it's just a marketing ploy.

2331521,4,B0009WK5CW,"Robert Ludlum wrote ""The Bourne Identity"" in the 1980's and it is the quintessential ""spy"" story. It is a thriller and the characters are so rich and well drawn.
A man is dragged from the sea. He has two bullet wounds and a ""chip"" embedded into his body. These are removed; the man recovers from this ordeal. He does not, however, remember anything, His name, where he is from from and his entire identity has been lost. He takes the chip and goes in search of himself. In a bank in Zurich he finds his identity- Jason Bourne and several other passports and lots of money. Enough information for Jason Bourne to change his identity whenever he needs to. But what does this mean?  It appears to mean that many people are after Jason Bourne, that he has information that many people want or they want this information to die!! Around every corner is danger and there is no one that he can trust. He meets up with two CIA analysts who appear to be trustworthy, but are they really?  He travels all over Europe and changes identities at every turn. He meets very interesting people at every turn. His life is full of risk and danger.  Jason Bourne is an important person with so much hidden information that he doesn't remember. But as time goes on, the people he meets share some of what he is missing, and he is beginning to put the pieces together.  He begins a love affair, and he thinks this is what he has been looking for. Why can't he be happy as a single man leaving the ""spy"" profession and finding his true love?
The movie stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, and he does a credible job. The action filming is wonderfully done. The car chases and the flights on foot and in trains are very real and I felt I was amongst them. I was part of the action!! Franke Potente plays Jason Bourne's love interest. Chris Cooper is the enemy and as always is a star- a cruel man who completes his job. The scenery is fantastic and brilliant. What I did miss in this movie that was not transposed from the book, is the storyline of Carlos, The Jackal. This is an important part of the book, and is not in the movie at all. Jason Bourne and Carlos have much admiratiion for each other even though they are sworn enemies. This is a significant loss, and the movie does not have the drama, background and richness of the book.  This is, however, a movie to be enjoyed- I understand the sequel, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is out this week. A Must See. prisrob",1090108800,,2442,4.370044052863436
2331522,2,B0009WK5CW,"No, really. Please read the book, so you can see it's almost impossible for a movie to compete with a book.

Of course Jackson's is a better one in my opinion, but Liman does get it  gone done in 2 hrs, so i don't have to piss my pants to watch the whole movie. This movie is still excellent despite it's errors, especially the car chase seen with the Mini. I really think think a VW GTi would been a more suitable car. Or maybe a Lancia. Anyhow, it comes off as a ""Italian Job"" knock off , (we already have one, by the same name coincedentally.) There is really no chemistry between Damon and Potente, which does make the romantic subplot feel tacked on. So why should you buy this movie?

2331523,4,B0009WK5CW,"I just watched this one within the last week, and I must say I was duly impressed.  This offering is fast-paced, high tech, very sexy - a wild ride from beginning to end.  I found it rather reminiscent of a James Bond movie, but much grittier and without a clearly defined enemy - at least early on.  One of the elements I most enjoyed was heavy sense of mystery that pervades the first half of the movie.
Matt Damon does a slightly above-average acting job as Jason Bourne, who doesn't even know his own name or identity when he is dragged half dead out of the Mediterranean by the crew of a French fishing boat.  The only clue about his past is a micro-laser embedded in his hip, which reveals the name of a bank in Zurich, along with a numbered Swiss account.  Weeks later, still no closer to overcoming his amnesia, he is put ashore and makes a beeline for Zurich, where he finds a safe deposit box containing a stack of passports in various names (one of which is Jason Bourne), as well as lots of cash and a gun.
Still quite confused but unsuspecting of any trouble, he heads to the American embassy with hopes of getting some answers.  His reception there, however, is less than cordial, and suddenly he finds himself the object of an intense manhunt for reasons he cannot begin to fathom.  To make matters worse, his pursuers obviously would rather see him dead than alive.  Thus begins a non-stop, pulse pounding race across Europe as Bourne tries both to stay alive and find out who he is and why so many people are after him.
Ultimately Bourne does figure out the answers to all his questions, but not before leaving in his wake a string of dead would-be assassins, along with a bunch of stymied police and covert operatives.  Unfortunately, he doesn't like what he finds out, and its clear that his past will never leave him alone.  This leaves the stage wide open for the sequel, ""The Bourne Supremacy"", which should hit the theaters quite soon.
Overall I thought this movie was extremely riveting and entertaining.  The acting wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't a liability either.  The story line definitely carries the movie, much more so than the actors.  If you haven't seen it, please do.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.

But the story is still wonderful and the interviews enjoyable.  I liked the behind-the-scenes info, but it wasn't anything extra special.
If you're wanting to know what happened between the time Jason confronts Treadstone to when he finds Marie, the alternate ""bookend"" ending is just a joy.

2331528,4,B0009WK5CW,"I was in the mood to watch an entertaining action flick that hopefully had some brains behind it, so I decided to pop ""The Bourne Identity"" into my DVD player (that, and the previews for the sequel looks really good, so I wanted to see this right away).  What I got was exactly what I expected, and then some.  This is a very exciting and sharp movie that is a lot of fun to watch.  There's lots of intense action to be enjoyed from this film.
Jason Bourne has a serious problem on his hands.  When he is left for dead and his body is discovered by fishermen, he awakes and realizes that he cannot remember who he is.  His memory is gone and he has no idea why or how he's there.  And even though he doesn't know who he is, he is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat and is a deadly weapon who can take down just about anyone.  When he tries to uncover his past and his identity, he finds people around every corner trying to kill him.  Turns out that he is in reality an agent/assassin for the U.S. government (a very secret branch of defense).  Since Bourne had failed his mission, they cannot afford to have him found out by others, so they know he must be terminated.  Well, Bourne isn't going to take that lightly.  He will take them head on and bring the fight to their doorsteps in order to find out who he is and why they want him dead.
This really was a good time.  I haven't been terribly impressed with some of the latest action blunders, so it was nice to see something that was entertaining and was actually smart at the same time.  Another plus is that the film doesn't try to be overly goofy, as a lot of other action flicks tend to be at times.  Granted, there is humor, but it's evenly spread out and is never overused.  Not only does the film have incredible action and fight scenes, but it also has a smart script and great character interaction.  The movie also shows that Matt Damon can be one heck of an action star.  I thought he could never pull it off, but he sure proved me wrong.  He's very believable in his role and he's able to pull of the action scenes with real authenticity.
The DVD has a few extras to offer.  First off, the movie looks very good and the sound is also terrific.  Extras that can be found on this DVD include commentary from the director, an alternate ending and an extended ""farmhouse"" scene, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a great music video by Moby, and some really neat DVD-ROM extras.  I didn't care much for the alternate ending, so I'm glad that they just stuck with what is in the movie.  All in all, not a bad package.
""The Bourne Identity"" can be enjoyed by those who want a smart and clever action movie that delivers.  There's a great script, a fantastic cast, and some out-of-this-world chase/fight scenes.  This was definitely a great time for me and I'm glad I finally got around to watching it.  If you haven't checked it out yet, then I really recommend it, especially if you're an action fan. -Michael Crane",1089504000,,2984,4.333333333333333

I think they should have stuck to the books plot instead of the damn eye candy plot they decided on in this upcoming movie. So, I am sure they will screw up the third movie as well.  I am still going to see it since I am a fan and to see how much difference there is between the book plot and the movie.  Anyway, nobody should buy this DVD, its the company's way of getting you to buy another DVD not needed.  Save  your money and buy the DVD of Bourne Supremacy when it comes out in few months. For all the die hard Bourne Fans, I recommend reading the books of Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum.",1089417600,,1086,4.207729468599034

I started in 1977 with Scarlatti Inheritance and have ever since been hooked to Ludlum. But Bourne Identity exploded on me like no other book or experience I had. It is more than a spy story or about a person called Bourne trying to fight tremendous odds with a total memory loss with bursts of memory flashes of the violent past with layers of different personalities. It is about human mind itself discovering its way using the ultimate training of the past to protect it and achieve the objective imprinted in the psyche. The events will linger forever in the mind and you will be hungry to read another book which can match this book. Yes! Read it ,Enjoy it and be haunted by it.

Matt Damon as an action hero?  Before this movie, maybe not.  You catch a glipse of his true acting talent in ""Talented Mr. Ripley"", but the talented Matt Damon is wholly believable as a top-flight assassin with amnesia (there's a challenge!)  The action choreographer is a genius, putting together very dynamic, kinetic fight scenes but also putting together a car chase that ranks among the best in film (before the ""Italian Job"" made small car chases vogue again).
Also effective is the set design and photography... possibly one of the more beautiful and aesthetically pleasing action films you'll ever see.  Widescreen DVD would likely bring the movie experience home to you (if you have the gear).
I was going to withhold a star, but there's no reason to do so.  This is one of the top ten action flicks of the past 20 years, and it cements Matt Damon as an actor with incredible range and talent.  Thoroughly enjoyable, beginning to end.

2331535,4,B0009WK5CW,"Setting the standard for international spy thrillers, Robert Ludlum succeeds again at packing more thrills into several hundred pages than one would conceive possible. With a neo-gothic setting that adds just the right ambiance for a shadowy spy tale, the book has every detail that could be wished for in a novel of this genre. A page-turner all the way through, the action, in this book, picks up almost immediately and doesn't let off until nearly the last page. The characters are also, by Ludlum's standards, remarkably well developed. Jason Bourne, the protagonist, suffers from none of the usual invulnerability that plagues most of most of Ludlum's protagonists. Bourne is an exceptional agent whose exploits will entertain you, but his failures and faults keep him human. Bourne, and his female companion's emotions add a further touch of humanity that is often missing from many spy novels and most of Ludlum's other work. My only criticism of the book's characters would be of the unlikely love connection between Bourne and his girlfriend. However, besides for the initial stretch of why the girl would fall for Bourne, the rest of the relationship is the most realistic to be found in Ludlum's works.
Readers of Ludlum's other works who have noticed the consistent pattern in nearly all of Ludlum's plots will be pleasantly surprised to find that this story bears little resemblance to the usual redundant theme. Where most off Ludlum's works feature a nearly all powerful military-industrial conspiracy for world domination as the antagonist, this book differs significantly with a much more realistic tale of two spies pitted against each other. The journey of self-discovery undertaken by the main character is nearly as important as the main adventure, adding further to the books realism. Unfortunately the book's more down to earth tone detracts from the climax. Instead the usual explosive Ludlum finish, I was left feeling slightly unsatisfied. Nevertheless, the book's overall novelty left me feeling more fulfilled than I did after completing many of Ludlum's stories.
Those who have seen the movie need have no worries that they already know the book's plot. This story has nothing to do with the far inferior tale shown on the silver screen. Those who enjoyed the movie should definitely pick up the book and, even those who have not seen the movie will probably enjoy this book if they have any fondness for the spy thriller genre. If you enjoyed this book, you should certainly read The Janson Directive, which is, in my opinion, Ludlum's best work.

You just want rest for the two protagonists, but they are being hunted mercilessly.  How they seek to evade capture while developing their relationship keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Entertaining from start to finish, the Bourne Identity is solid crowd pleasing entertainment and a more than solid vehicle for Matt Damon who gives an excellent performance.

2331538,4,B0009WK5CW,"Okay! This is a suspense/thriller/action/spy movie that's character driven with a really great movie team in Director Doug Limon (Go, Swingers, The O.C.), Screen Writer Tony Gilroy (Deloris Claiborne, Devil's Advocate, and The Cutting Edge) and the Author of the novel `The Bourne Identity', Robert Ludlum as one of the executive producers along with Frank Marshall (all the `Indiana Jones' movies, all the `Back to the Future' movies, and The Sixth Sense) as executive producers.
Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne a man trained and conditioned to disappear by a Black Ops Division of the CIA but something has gone wrong. Unconscious and wounded he was rescued by a fishing boat off the coast of France with out his memory; two bullet holes to the back and a numbered Swiss Bank account  are his only clues to his identity. Of course, his former employer is now also looking for him and things get complicated.
In comes Marie (Franka Potenta) a young women who gives Jason Bourne a ride to Paris. This is first and foremost an action film but there is no denying the chemistry that exists between the characters of Jason and Marie so it's interesting to see the dynamics of Action, Suspense, and Romantic Hope!
I won't go into the movie as it's more fun to watch and see for your self but it was a great action movie with wonderful performances throughout. I will say Chris Cooper (Lone Star, American Beauty, and Seabiscuit) plays the Black Ops director and gives a glowing performance. Can you tell I really like Chris Cooper?
The direction in this movie was superb. Doug Limon did an excellent job of telling this story and setting the mood with innovative camera work that gave you a feel for each character and scene. When the character was off kilter he made you feel off kilter with his careful, deliberate direction. I will have to make an effort to see more of Doug Limon's films.

2331540,4,B0009WK5CW,"A surprise at every turn, Mr Ludlum makes me want to keep reading from page to page, chapter to chapter, and on into the next 2 books in this trilogy.
This was my first Robert Ludlum book, and in a round-about way, I picked it up because of the movie.  This is to say that I picked it up because I liked the movie, and told a friend about the movie, who replied to me ""Don't want to see it....it can't be as good as the book!""  So I took a friend's advice, bought the book, started to read it and was side-tracked for a while.  But I picked it back up about a week ago, when I heard about the 2nd movie coming out, and re-read the entire book, including the unfinished part, in about 8 days.
Mr Ludlum sure does keep the thrills and surprises coming.  I am not sure what my problem was with not finishing it the first time, I am not a fast reader and I had a little trouble biting off 530 pages, but it was well worth it.  And I look VERY forward to the next installment, The Bourne Supremacy.
I could have done without the swearing, but other than that, the story line was quite unique and was not at all guessable.  I was surprised with the outcome of the main characters, but not the main villian, since there are sequals.  But I am happy with the result.

2331541,5,B0009WK5CW,"I bought ""The Bourne identity"" mostly because I didn't want to lose the opportunity of reading Ludlum's book before the release of a film based on it. I really wasn't a fan of the author (and I am not one now), but I loved this book.

To start with, the plot is remarkably good. ""The Bourne identity"" is the story of a man without a past, rescued from the Mediterranean Sea by some fishermen. He is very ill, and his body has suffered the impact of many bullets. The man is taken by the fishermen to a doctor in a nearby island, who helps him to recover physically and mentally. Our protagonist doesn't remember who he is, but with the help of the doctor he finds some clues he doesn't like too much. He only knows for certain some things, for instance that his face has been altered by plastic surgery, that he knows a lot about firearms and that he carried on him a microfilm that contains the code to an account of four million dollars.

In the Swiss bank where the account is he also finds a name: Jason Bourne. But... is he Jason Bourne?. He cannot remember, and if it were for quite a few people, he won't. From the moment he leaves the island onwards, our man without a past will be followed, and attacked. He doesn't understand why, but he reacts in order to stay alive. Add to this already interesting mixture a woman he takes as a hostage, Marie, a number of assasins (including the most famous assassin in the world, Carlos), and the possibility that he is, as a matter of fact, also an assassin, and you will understand why this book is so good. The main character will be hunted all throughout the book not only by the ""bad guys"", but also by the ""good"" ones (mainly agents from the USA Government). You won't be able to stop reading this book, and you will find yourself asking aloud to nobody in particular ""who on earth is this man?"" and ""what started this whole mess""?.

All in all, I highly recommend this book to those who appreciate a good thriller, and to those who don't usually read this kind of book but are open to new experiences. I belong to the last category, as I only read ""The Bourne identity"" because I was interested in watching the movie of the same name.

By the way, I also recommend the movie (the 2002 version, with Matt Damon), that ended up bearing only a limited resemblance to the book. If I had to choose, I would choose the book without hesitation, but if you have the possibility not only of reading the book but also of watching the movie, do both things... You won't regret it, and you will probably have fun trying to compare the movie to the book !!

2331542,4,B0009WK5CW,"Matt Damon in his first ""action hero"" role is very good as the amnesiac Jason Bourne, who wakes up on a fishing ship not knowing anything about his past.  As in all covert agent movies, Bourne is being hunted by his superiors to eliminate him since he failed in his mission.  Damon has the right amount of boyish exuberance and masculine machismo to infuse life and credibility into his unbelievable predicament.  Franka Potente is a good foil and companion for Damon in her role as his reluctant sidekick; her transformation from coquettish flirt to persistent helper is well done.  Clive Owen in a small role as an assassin has a very good scene in which he extols the life of the undercover agent just before he bites the dust. Academy award winner Chris Cooper joins such notables as Al Pacino (Recruit), James Caan (Eraser) as the superior who will go to any lengths to tidy up a mess.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles round out the cast, but their performances are merely acceptable and nothing other talented actors couldn't have done..maybe even better.
I didn't see the first version of this (with Richard Chamberlain), so I can't compare; I also haven't read Mr. Ludlum's book..but this is a well done, well directed action movie, and I look forward to the sequel.",1084665600,,1269,4.723981900452489
2331543,5,B0009WK5CW,"This film seemed to vanish quickly, so easily confused with about a dozen lesser films about spies and rampant covert operations. That's a shame, because this one is a cut above the rest that may have to wait a few years to get its due.
If you like spy films, or just well made action films that don't fizz at the end, you really should add this one to your collection. It's from the Robert Ludlum book, all about a highly and expensively trained covert agent suffering from amnesia. What this film has going for it is the following:
Director, Doug Liman, demonstrates an expert hand at action sequences. When master killing machine, Jason Bourne, senses something isn't right, Liman's expert film making begins to ratchet up the tension almost subconsciously. By the time the action comes, the viewer has been expertly brought to the edge of his seat. These action sequences build to a perfect climax of violence that is always satisfying. The fight scenes are among the finest I have seen in any recent film. There is nothing in this director's resume to suggest this, but trust me; he knows what he's doing. All the action has real weight and danger, which is an almost specialized talent for directors. Think Walter Hill. Thing Sam Peckinpah.
This movie also has brilliant, believable performances all around.
First and foremost among them, Matt Damon simply does everything right in this role. In an action film, often the lead isn't called upon to do a lot of top drawer acting, which is fine. Being believable in an action scene is talent enough, in my book. But in this role, Matt Damon is required to do some old-school, plain old acting, and he more than meets the challenge. See, the hook of this film is the main character, Jason Bourne, is waking up from an amnesia fog and slowly discovers his immense, instinctive prowess as a killer/agent. So the actor must make a shift now and then from moments of confusion and innocence to complete mastery of any physical situation. In addition, the character is slowly coming to the conclusion that the memories he has of his passed life, he no longer wants. In short, he does not want the life he is remembering. Damon is very touching in these scenes, and his acting is very, very solid. His performance here, and in The Talented Mr. Ripley, is so good it makes you wonder why he hangs around Ben Afleck.
Franka Potente, the actress who plays his romantic interest, is such an incredible actress. She is simply a pleasure to watch, and she always brings such authenticity to her roles. She is no model turned actress, this one. She demonstrated her action/acting chops in Run, Lola, Run, a few years ago, and it was a brilliant move casting her here. She is simply beautiful in a very unique way, and she can act the socks of the current crop of female leads. Potente always looks in place in al her roles, and it's a damn shame she doesn't get more work.
Finally, the smaller parts shine as well. My favorite being the assassin sent to kill Bourne, played with black-eyed menace by Clive Owen. It's a very small part, but crucial, and Owen makes the most of it. Also, the always reliable Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are on board as the sinister, competent bosses of the covert operations.
This is really a great addition to any action DVD collection. -Mykal Banta",1084579200,,3320,4.638370118845501

The Bourne Identity is a diverting if somewhat insubstantial thriller. It has the power to shock and, yes, thrill the first time around, but repeated viewings add nothing, except for a bewildering sense of how amazing technology is and how poor secret agents are at using it. Bourne relies on miraculous escape after miraculous escape and gets by on chance, fortitude and circumstance. Certainly doesn't reinforce one's faith in the ""intelligence agencies"".  The plot is nicely played and well acted and the car chase bits are good, as is the tension between the main characters, but the love story that grows out of that is unbelievable and diverts from the main theme of the movie -

Jason Bourne in The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum experiences this. In his world he is born an adult and discovers quickly that he has very disturbing talents such as brutal self-defense skills, harsh interrogative capabilities, and  an extensive knowledge of weaponry. This book offers a very intriguing and fruitful plot. I enjoyed reading The Bourne Identity because Robert Ludlum goes into depth about the modus operandi of all of the antagonists, protagonists, and governmental intelligence agencies. In this book Robert Ludlum has a tendency to elaborate too much about situations at times. Sometimes this would cause me to lose interest and focus. Other than that I felt that The Bourne Identity was very enjoyable to read.
 In The Bourne Identity the suspense never ceases to exist. The main characters are always running, scheming, or fighting for their lives. Someone seeking to read an action packed, adventure novel will most likely enjoy this book. Also, someone who enjoys learning about psychology and how the brain works will enjoy this book very much. In this book, one will understand how someone could react in certain situations after having experienced extreme amnesia. Throughout this book Jason Bourne hears certain things or sees certain things that for some reason make him see horrific images. A psychiatrist or psychology teacher would most definitely love this book.

2331551,3,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne Identity (Doug Liman, 2002)
Why we need fluffy remakes of movies has been hotly debated in Hollywood for decades. (After all, it's nothing new. Bunuel's 1977 film That Obscure Object of Desire was the sixth adaptation of Louys' novel Woman and Puppet.) After all, rarely is the remake even watchable, much less on a par with the original.
This is one of the exceptions. The new version of The Bourne Identity, directed by Doug Liman of Go fame, contains all the fluff factor of an awful remake yet remains watchable in a turn-your-brain-off way. Jason Bourne is portrayed here by Matt Damon, who shows that he really can be something other than Ben Affleck's geeky best friend. Obligatory love interest Marie is played by indie darling Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), and a well-cast batch of supporting characters keep the acting level higher than one normally gets from this sort of thing while never quite taking themselves too seriously. (The exception to that last bit is Chris Cooper, playing Bourne's boss, but then he's supposed to be a high-strung neurotic.)

2331552,4,B0009WK5CW,"I enjoyed this.  It was good to see it brought into the 21st century, the 1988 Richard Chamberlain version did follow the book better but Matt Damon was pretty hot as the confused and memory challenged assassin Jason Bourne who wakes up on a ship with two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is or how he ended up in the middle of the ocean in a wet suit and a numbered Swiss Bank Account embedded in his hip.
Jason soon becomes aware that he is no ordinary man.  He speaks several languages fluently and he can kill silently and efficiently.  All of this adds to his confusion, and we are treated to a mad, frantic dash through the streets of various European Cities as Jason tries to remember who he is and what the word Treadstone means before he ends up on a slab in a morgue...
Franka Potente plays the young German woman who helps Jason find out who he is, she is pretty good as his love interest, being both brave and vulnerable in the same breath, you will probably remember her from ""Run Lola Run"" a quirky little film slightly reminiscent of the concept of ""Sliding Doors"" but with a sharper more violent edge.
""The Bourne Identity"" is a fairly fast paced movie that is nothing like the book it is taken from which is a shame because the book is excellent; however this is a good little film in its own right.  Not one that I would have gone to the big screen to see but I do think it is worthy of a DVD and its one I would watch again and again just for the excellent fight scenes and great chases especially the first car chase with a battered mini and some fantastic stunt driving.

So far so good.  It's rather intriguing to watch Damon's acting, especially when he goes to the Swiss bank and discovers passports from many countries with his photo as well as lots of cash.  And, by the way, he also finds himself fluent in  French and German as well as English.

All of a sudden, his life is in danger.  And so is the life of the pretty girl, played by Frank Potente, who only meant to give him a lift to Paris and never meant the relationship to develop past that.  Ha Ha!

Somehow the CIA is involved and paid assassins are sent to kill our hero.  Chris Cooper is cast as the evil CIA commander.  It's an easy role and certainly below the quality of fine acting demanded in other films such as Seabiscuit and Adaptation.  But I guess that the powers that be know that he'll be good in whatever role is cast his way.

There's lots of action, several murders and many chase scenes.  And I think I was supposed to care.  But I found the premise impossible to relate to, and the action similar to that in a thousand other films.  And when the plot got confusing, I actually fell asleep and missed the last 20 minutes of the film.",1078444800,,1478,4.199288256227758
2331555,3,B0009WK5CW,"Jason Bourne is a CIA operative who kills for a living. His hesitation to kill in one instance nearly costs him his life and results in almost complete memory loss. His life is saved by a group of fishermen who rescue him unconscious on the open seas.
The rest of the movie deals with his attempts to regain his memory. He meets up with a German girl in Zurich who helps him along the way, and suprise, suprise they get romantically involved. Will these cliche'd romances ever end in film?
The film is action-packed from start to finish. Matt Damon is convincing as an assassin and perhaps his work in the Talented Mr. Ripley helped to create this impression for me. There aren't any suprises in the story and most of it is fairly straightfoward. So if you like movies which keep you guessing till the end, this one may not be your cup of tea.
If on the other hand, you love action films, which aren't totally mindless (See all films by Schwarzenegger) and have great acting, then this film may be for you.",1078272000,,1006,4.443243243243243

2331558,5,B0009WK5CW,"So many of the 'spy thrillers' of recent day seem recycled (for lack of a better word). Ludlum did a fantastic job of not only creating a unique storyline, but a unique lead character in 'Jason Bourne'. In the opening stages of the book, not only is Bourne a mystery to the reader, he is a mystery to himself. It's as if you are learning about Bourne as he does (as an amnesiac). The plot has central ties in Paris, but the characters make appearances around the world. By the end of the book, it seems as if the protagonist is completely riddled with bullet holes but still manages to come out alive. This is the first (of 3) in the Bourne series. If you've seen the movie (which was very good), make sure you still read the book. The book is even better...which is usually the case.",1076457600,,784,4.304054054054054

Of course, I was eager to try a new author since I had read at least twelve of John Grisham's in a row and was needing a break from the lawyer frenzy.  In the midst I found myself caught up in the unusual twists and the unsuspecting turns of this phenominal book.  Ludlum is an extraordinary author who has an amazing ability to captivate your mind.
  The twists in this book are far greater than what is reflected in the movie.  Hollywood, will be Hollywood, thus adding material that is nonexistant in the book in order to spice things up.  Unfortunately for Ludlum's advent readers, we were given a waterdowned version of an extraordinary novel.",1075939200,,752,4.567164179104478
2331560,1,B0009WK5CW,"I will concede that the book did have a lot of action and plot twists.  Without giving away too much of the plot, here's the general idea.  The heroine receives some trauma to the head which results in amnesia.  The only clue to his identity is a secret bank account number found on his person.  Upon trying to track down his identity, the protagonist discovers he has secret-agent-type skills and a seemingly endless number of bad guys are trying to kill him.
The plot did seem to be well thought out and I'd say it is not at all predictable, but one repetitive theme ruined the book for me; it seemed as though the main character is getting shot or blown up in every chapter of the book.  That in itself isn't necessarily bad, but he gets riddled with bullets and manages to keep going, and this happens repeatedly.  It reminds me of those thriller/horror movies where you think the villain is dead, but he keeps coming back to life for that last attempt to kill the teenagers.
At first, this didn't bother me, and I was enjoying the book;  however, I can only take so much unbelievable garbage.  As I reached the half-way point I found I had to force myself to continue reading, and after a few sessions after that, I gave up on the book; I couldn't stand it anymore.
If you can overlook this major annoyance, then you probably would like this book, but if you're like me and need certain aspects of the action to have a fragment of realism, then you might want to look for something else to read.",1075593600,,1500,4.409420289855072
2331561,4,B0009WK5CW,"I first happened to watch part of THE BOURNE IDENTITY on cable. I watched the first twenty minutes of the film before I had to leave. What I saw intrigued me enough that a few weeks later I rented the DVD. Overall, the movie wasn't too shabby. It's got some good action sequences (especially the car chase) and a few unexpected surprises. Still, the ending of the movie was a little bit of a letdown, almost too clichd. The audience knew from the beginning who Jason Bourne was almost from the beginning and is left with a suspicion of how the film will end. Nevertheless, it's still kind of a letdown--I was hoping for more of a ""Nowhere Man"" type plot. Anyway. Matt Damon does a great job as the title character and Chris Cooper, well, Chris Cooper can seem to improve any role he plays no matter how clichd they are. Overall, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a decent action/spy flick. You might not enjoy it, but you'll at least feel like you watched a good movie.

The DVD includes several deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette promo, a music video, and the usual director's commentary.",1074988800,,1090,4.589743589743589
2331562,4,B0009WK5CW,"I did not see this movie when it first came out as I am getting tired of the summer extravaganzas that try to outdo one another with how many more explosions they can generate than what is playing in the next theatre. Notwithstanding,  I decided to give it a shot as I loved the energy and pacing of director Doug Liman's ""Go,"" and also liked the comedic edge and freshness that he brought to his debut (""Swingers""). I was still somewhat apprehensive as taut and original action thrillers are very hard to come by as most current movies couple the violence with buddy comedy elements that take away from a genre that has only been successfully executed by Steven Spielberg in his wildly entertaining ""Minority Report"". But I digress.
Since I hate it when reviewers give too much away, I will only say that Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne (or is he?), a barely alive amnesiac with a pair of bullet wounds in his back, pulled from the Mediterranean by Italian fishermen. The scene itself is very exciting and draws you into it's web. Bourne's only clue to his own identity is a bank account number etched on a capsule implanted in his body. What follows gets very complicated and keeps you on the edge of your seat as other summer extravaganzas seem to fail to. Like its summer ""cousins"", the movie has action scenes, guns, explosions, an awesome car chase (that relies more on execution than on how many cars can explode), a potential love interest, and many of the usual suspects, BUT it entertains and I did not feel like checking my watch every 5 minutes. Is it Oscar material? Heck no, but within its own genre its one of the year's best.
Matt Damon, who I never quite appreciate, would seem to be miscast to play this type of character, but he is actually quite perfect is he tones it down and makes Jason Bourne almost seem like an everyman who slowly discovers that he has skills he never knew he had. The casting department should be proud of itself as it cast Franka Potente (from ""Run Lola Run"") as the main female protagonist. The actress is not your cookie cutter beauty nor has the marquee appeal that I am sure the producers would have liked to have a ""name"" for the role; but someone realized that her acting chops and international background would give the movie some grounding as her character is supposed to be a European gypsy woman who I could not see being played by say Julia Roberts.
The director does a great job in both action and character driven scenes and manages to bring excitement to a gray winter European exteriors and drab interior settings. With the exception of the first fight sequence (which is makes Damon look like he has superhero powers) and later what would seem to be a physically impossible shoot out, everything feels real and the violence is not stylized. The story is incredibly well paced and even the smaller roles are well cast. The only exception is Julia Stiles, who I hope was only a victim of some scenes winding up on the cutting room floor, as she's a talented actress who brings not a thing to this movie.
In a nutshell, this movie is about international intrigue and one man's refusal to be a pawn in some sinister, global chess game. Many things feel improbable but never less than engrossing. Also, the basic premise is not played for laughs (which I enjoyed as I am sick of tongue in cheek homages that use humor as a cop out) and the plot (once fully exposed)  for once does not involve a ""brilliant"" psychopath with either a desire to take over the world or get even for ______ (fill in the blank with your favorite clich). This movie solidly earns its 4 stars as a nice version of what I'd like to see in summer extravaganzas.",1074988800,,3692,4.525449101796407
2331563,2,B0009WK5CW,"With so many meaningless action movies nowadays, most of them are just pieces of fight sequences glued with weak acting and nonexistant plot. ""The Bourne Identity"" is not a bad action movie, but never steps above average material either. Matt Damon is ok as the lost Jason Bourne and Doug Liman knows how to make some creative and credible action sequences, but the plot is still typical and not very different from so many other spy films. The predictable ending doesn`t help, either.
While it is moderately entertaining, ""The Bourne Identity"" never achieves that ""something"" that could make it a must-see. A well-made product, but not much else. Let`s wait for the sequel.",1074470400,,674,4.9734513274336285

Almost immediately he is forced to defend himself, and he soon discovers that he possesses the skills of a very dangerous man. With nowhere to go, he turns to the aid of poor German traveler named Marie (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris. Racing to unlock the secrets of his own identity, he discovers that he is an elite government agent. His CIA superior (Chris Cooper), sees Bourne as a rogue agent, and dispatches assassins to kill Bourne. Now the government's top agent, has become its number one target...
I had extremely low expectations going into ""The Bourne Identity"". Matt Damon has never done anything action related, and there have been many spy thrillers made over the years. I was pleasantly surprised. The action sequences are amazing, the fights are choreographed extremely well, there are tons of twists and turns to keep you guessing, the suspense is nail-biting at times, and the romance between Matt Damon and Run Lola Run's Franka Potente is great. Not to mention the fact that Damon is quite convincing and pulls the role off like he is a veteran action star. This film literally has everything that it takes to make a great movie. As far as the spy criteria goes, I was very pleased as well. The character Jason Bourne does not have any gadgets or gizmos to help him out. He must rely on his hands and his brain to get him out of jam after jam. This results in and excellent cat-and-mouse chase for the whole film. As you can see, the film does have a lot to offer. However, the reason that I cannot give it a five star rating, is due to the fact that it can be slow moving at times, which affects the overall pace of the film. Instead of flowing smoothly, it felt a bit choppy at times. But for the most part, the film is extremely enjoyable.
This is the best spy thriller that I have seen since ""Ronin"". ""The Bourne Identity"" works so well, because it has something for everyone whether it be romance, suspense, action, or spy related. The DVD offers an alternate ending, deleted scenes, a making of featurette, and more.",1073347200,,2343,4.515294117647059
2331565,3,B0009WK5CW,"I found it rather amusing to see this film--Matt Damon's first real foray into ""Jack Ryan"" territory--derail any of Ben Affleck's hopes of becoming a credible action star.  Although not as mysterious as it should be (especially when compared to the book), ""The Bourne Identity"" has several things going for it, not the least of which is a brisk pace, and credible direction.
For starters, Europe looks much better through the eyes of Director Doug Liman than it did in Brian DePalma's ""Mission:Impossible"".  Filming on location in Europe will always look better than on a studio backlot, no matter what the pundits say.
The action sequences are quite good; although they're more violent than spy thrillers from my youth, they're not as over the top as they could be, but still frenetic enough to appeal to martial arts buffs as well as fans of the original novel.
Another plus is the use of Franka Potente, who fits the role of Maria far better than any name, plastic-surgery-disaster actress from Hollywood.  At the very least, she and Damon possess far more chemistry than did Affleck and Charlize Theron in the tepid ""Reindeer Games"".
From top to bottom, a crisp, by-the-numbers spy movie that will keep you entertained throughout, but I doubt this film will age very well.",1073260800,,1276,4.898148148148148

The book is exciting because Jason Bourne (Damon) is up against the deadliest assasin of all time, Carlos the Jackal, and his origins are a mystery until the very end. Carlos is nowhere in this film, and the secrets of the organization Bourne is from is revealed in the first 15 mins.
Another thing that I haven't seen in over a decade, is a very anti-climatic ending. No real final showdown with the bad guy, no incredible revelations, just an action scene that's less exciting than the first fight Bourne has.

The depth of the plot of the book is truly stunning - the twists and turns are intriguing and really serve to drive the book forward. The movie eliminates a lot of the back story to fit in the time limit. While I will agree that the action and pace of the movie are on the high side, I was very disappointed in how little of the original plot was preserved. And while I've loved Matt Damon in some of his other roles, I don't feel that he did a very good job of portraying the inner turmoil of Jason Bourne as he struggles through his amnesia and trying to discover who he is.

But the exotic European locations, and believable if not comic book performances move this along faster than a high speed European railway system. It's all pretty exciting, if not complex.

You can really tell that it was adapted from a really deep and high-quality book (which I'm gonna have to check out as well now). The characters are so interesting and the action is AMAZING. Some of the scenes seemed so simple but I was clenching my fists with my eyes glued to the screen.

2331587,4,B0009WK5CW,"Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a man who's found afloat in the sea with several bullets in his back. He's salvaged by a fishing boat and awakens to discover he has no memory of his previous life. After he recuperates, he heads to shore to find his true identity. With the assistance of a pretty German woman (Franka Potente), Bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracks.
The Bourne Identity is an interesting summer thriller. It's certainly not an all-out action blockbuster, as the previews might lead you to believe, but there are some terrific action sequences. What truly makes the film work is Damon himself, whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging. The movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past, we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes.
From a certain point-of-view, Franka Potente isn't useful except as a love interest, and on that level, her presence works. Not only is she a fine actress, but she and Damon share a palpable chemistry. Hopefully, she'll return in the sequel, and this series won't go the Bond/M:I route with a new love interest in every installment. Take note, Hollywood, steadiness and consistent relationships are always appreciated.
The Bourne Identity's premise is similar to The Long Kiss Goodnight's, but unlike that movie, takes its story seriously and aspires to work as both a thriller and a character-oriented drama, which it does. Once Bourne's past is revealed (not that it isn't that hard to figure out), the film loses a bit of momentum, but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion (compared to say, Bond, Triple X, or M:I).
For action fans, there's enough here to keep them satisfied, with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of Paris. I've seen at least two other films with auto chases set in Paris (Ronin, The Transporter) and this one's my favorite, even though it's also the shortest and features the least attractive car (a mini as compared to an Audi in Ronin and a BMW in The Transporter).
There are a few disappointments here and there, particularly Bourne's showdown with The Professor (Clive Owen), which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge build-up. Julia Stiles is also in the film, and her presence is rather distracting (I can't look at her without thinking, ""Hey, it's Julia Stiles!"") in a role that could have been played by just about anyone. But in the end, The Bourne Identity succeeds because it rarely goes over-the-top (no megalomaniacal billionaires here), maintains an even tone, and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling.",1064620800,,2815,4.953488372093023

When i saw the Previews and trailer for this one, i immediately thought that same thing was going on. But when we got it on video, and i watched it for the first time, i realized that it was as complex, thrilling, and action-packed as it looks. There is adrenaline and ""testosterone"" in this movie, but enough plot to make the action more satisfying, and give it a point. Two complaints, however. When Bourne fights the guy who later jumps out the window, towards the beginning, stabs him twice with a blue pen, and throws him over the table and he lands on the floor, why does he just get back up and fight like it never happened? this must have been for style points, and it was kind of cool, but considering the plausibility of the rest of the story, i expected something a little more realistic. Also when he jumps off the balcony near the end and shoots two guys as he falls down like 4 flights of stairs, and lands on the guy, stops for a second, catches his breath, and gets up, the same thing applies. But these things should be taken lightly as they are, and of course, it IS hollywood. Great movie, up there with the Jack Ryan movies.

The fast-paced fight scenes aren't at all believable.  The main character has skills comparable to an entire team of highly trained operatives.  The good news is that these outrageous elements blend right in with the light-hearted nature of the film.

This latest offering does not disappoint - it's gripping from start to finish. Damon in particular has a knack for drawing the audience in to his frantic, frightening world, and this enables us to empathise with his plight. Clever and fast-paced, it still has enough character development for us to feel some degree of emotion for the leads by the closing credits.
In the same way that 'Enemy of the State' made us realise how easy it could be for corrupt government organisations to find almost anyone (and eliminate them if considered enough of a threat), this movie shows us how advanced communication technology is today, and how important it is to have the right checks and balances for groups with this much power.

This was a fast-paced movie that twisted and turned, but not so much that you lost track of what was going on.  Having said that you do need to watch the movie and not do 5 other things at the same time!

2331604,3,B0009WK5CW,"I like Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting). I like Franka Potente (Run Lola Run). I like director Doug Liman (Swingers, Go). I like Julia Stiles. I like Chris Cooper. I was ready to like this film. But how could I? It was really boring.

I'm not usually a person who notices interpersonal onscreen chemistry, but there is NO chemistry between Damon and Potente; as a matter of fact, if you told me they hated each other during filming, I'd believe it.  Secondly, the plot is implausible. We never really know why Cooper wants to kill Damon. Would you train a guy who could do all this stuff, and then just wipe him out if one mission went wrong? Finally, and most egregiously, the action is just plain boring. The car chase from the trailer is the movie's best action sequence, and it takes place in the middle of the film.  There is nothing very exciting after that.

I had hoped for great scenes of Europe, and what we see of locations in Prague and Paris are beautiful, but they are infrequent.  Julia Stiles and Chris Cooper are utterly wasted.

DVD extras are good.  Four deleted scenes, an extended scene and an alternate ending, director's commentary, a Moby video, a 14-minute featurette/promo, a trailer, production notes, cast & crew credits, and DVD-ROM features that will work only on Windows machines.

Basically, if you can't figure it out, he was set up for an assassination, or was he? Kind of set up, mediumish, anyways all I know is that Jason was shot 2 times in the back, and yea he screwed up probably. So what is it. Well theres some nice fighting, some good gun shooting action, even a nice car scene.
He lost his memory, so he is trying to retrace his steps sort of. He does a fantastic job of being a spy like guy, and has some good instincts, I just loved it for the first time though.

2331607,5,B0009WK5CW,"I guess I was fortunate to not have any expectations when I saw the movie for I had not yet read the book.  So in terms of just a movie the Bourne Identity is awesome!!!  Everything fits together really well and there were no holes.  For a spy movie that's very rare.  But this movie had very little flaws.  While it's hard to say anything about the movie without giving away the bigger picture, I can say both Matt Damon and Franka Potente played their roles extremely well.  Matt Damon was convincing as a martial arts expert/spy while Franka Potente was believable as an innocent beautiful bystander just trying to help...  And when I say beautiful I mean BEAUTIFUL.  What a gorgeous lady she is, on and off the camera!  And her beauty exudes in this film.
There are other good things about this movie besides the credible acting!  There were some great fight scenes, which Matt Damon was quite good in.  The plot was superb with very little/to no holes in it.  It was both intriguing and suspenseful and had and ambiance about it that's hard to describe.  The superb cinematography was partially responsible for this but what I think added to the feel and really brought this movie to life was the musical score!  It did everything a good score does.  It brought you to the edge of your seat when it wanted you there or calmed you down when it was time to be calm.  From the opening credits the music presented suspense and mystery!  If you get a chance check out the score!  It's awesome to listen to by itself!  On top of this, the movie has one of the most fun car chases with Matt Damon behind the wheel of an old school Mini!  While in the background is an awesome song by Paul Oakenfold called ""Ready Steady Go"" from his new CD Bunkka.
All in all this movie was great but there is a problem with it.  Though, it's only a problem if you make it one.  The novel by Robert Ludlum for which the movie is named is quite different.  With the exception of the basic premise of Jason Bourne and who he is, the two stories have few things in common.  If you're a fan of the book you will be disappointed in how different it is.  On the flip side if you can watch the movie impartially, chances are it will take on it's own existence and will be enjoyable.  As I stated previously, I hadn't read the book before I watched the movie.  Though the movie did inspire me to read it.  This kept me impartial while watching the movie.  The book was very awesome but it was so unbelievably different that I recognize both as there own entity.
If you're a fan of the book don't expect too much from this movie and I'm sure you will enjoy it for what it is, an action packed suspense mystery!  If you like the movie, then check out the book.  But be forewarned, the book is old school!  Some of the references to technology will make you chuckle if you're young or make you reminisce if you're older.",1061424000,,2890,4.324022346368715

okay, well with that said, the Bourne Identity wasn't terrible, but it wasn't particularly good either.  While I was reading it, I couldn't help but think it was perfect to send to hollywood as a move plot and lo and behold, poof.  The story line has an interesting premise (a man wakes up with amnesia on a fishing boat and the only clue to his identity is a microchip that was implanted in his body...)  but it starts to read a little predictably after that, just like a typical hollywood blockbuster should.  enter the love interest who will help him understand who he really is and change him through her love, a chase across europe and the united states ensues, etc. etc.  it's good mind-numbing reading, but don't expect anything monumentally novel and ground-breaking or life changing.

I think the Bond films are too stylized and outlandish, while this was not only a more realistic spy film but also enjoyable to watch. I gained a lot of respect for Matt Damon, as he was very effective and according to the DVD extras, he did his own stunts. Speaking of the DVD, it has an excellent presentation and a few good extras (Moby video and commentary in particualar). Chris Cooper is excellent, as always. Some people think it veers away from the books too much, however I haven't read those yet. As a film, it definitely stands on it's own feet.

2331625,3,B0009WK5CW,"I really enjoyed the movie, simple plot, great story, good cast. But a different story is being told in the book. It's far more complicated: one really has to concentrate and read carefully every sentence in order to understand what's going on. I'm almost done reading it and I still don't have a clear picture on who's who. There's so much confusion and the story is so complicated it's almost annoying. I also don't like the long dialogues between Jason and Marie. They slow the book down enormously. Reading this book should be a heart-pounding experience, but instead it becomes incredibly boring.

Speaking of Marie, I don't like her character either. All that happens between Jason and her, seems so unlikely it's almost funny and ridiculous. She is portrayed as this superwoman, sometimes casting a big dark shadow upon Jason's figure (which should be the strong one). She practically leads him by hand, tells him what to do.
Jason is supposed to be very bright, very strong...a superman without memory. Instead he seems like a frightened child, who needs help from a woman in order to understand what's going on. He therefore becomes weak and dependent upon others. It's not the Jason I saw and liked in the movie.
The plot also never seems to go past Paris, everything is being played out there. I think this book lacks on mobility and tension. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who's looking for the same story of the movie.",1059868800,,1435,4.786290322580645

2331639,5,B0009WK5CW,"In what can only be described as one of the best thrillers to come out of the fantasy factory in recent memory, rising star Matt Damon shows why his career is bound for glory in terms of both incredible versatility and sheer star power. In this loosely adapted version of best-selling mystery author Robert Ludlum, Damon plays the lead part of Jason Bourne, and man who awakes from shock aboard a Portuguese fishing boat with two gaping bullet holes in his back and a terrific case of amnesia. As he lands with some evidence of some puzzling leads in port, he follows the lead and slips into a nightmare world where everyone is chasing him and he has no idea of what is going on.
Along the way he enlists the support of an existentially challenged twenty-something woman in search of her life, and the two of them fend their perilous way through the maze of inexplicable violence and mind-boggling subtexts. Thus, discovering through a passport that his name is Jason Bourne, an American living in a sumptuous upstairs flat in Paris, Bourne and the soon to be main squeeze are assaulted by an assassin. And in the midst of all this pounding, he discovers more and more about his assailants, his own mysterious combat capabilities, and finally himself.
The cinematography is excellent, and adds to the lure of the film, as does the young main squeeze, a relatively unknown actress (Franka Potente) whose only other screen credit is for ""Run Lola Run"". One suspects we will be seeing more of her soon. The sets are realistic, and some of the chase scenes are extremely well choreographed, filmed and spliced together in some of the most exciting and memorable heart-pounders in recent memory.  The sporting cast is excellent and quite believable, the plot is a bit sticky but plausible, and as sheer entertainment it is a great afternoon's entertainment. I expect we will soon see a sequel or two, as the Bourne character is certainly an appealing and exciting film figure. Until then, enjoy this one!",1057968000,,1999,4.777456647398844
2331640,5,B0009WK5CW,"I have read the Bourne Trillogy by Robert Ludlum, which is a very great series however when I heard they were going to make movies on them I was a little skeptical. These books are highly involved psychological thrillers, not really good for movies. The movie adaptation takes a lot of the plot, character traits and locations and adapts them to a more practical script. Matt Damon is perfect in this role as the confused spy whose memory gradually comes back to him.
Now taking The Bourne Identity paticularly from a movie standpoint it is superb. The action is enough to compete with today's action films and even add some of their own memorable scenes, for example the Mini car chase and many of Bourne's fight scenes. The soundtrack was excellent for this mysterious action thriller and really put you in the mood as apposed to just playing loud synthesized music like majority of action films.

  The extras on this DVD are great and many will like it but the one thing that I loved are the deleted scenes. The alternate ending was probably the best ending they had but because of Hollywood politics, especially with the potential franchise of this movie, it was too romantic and intense for any sequel to go on.

Matt Damon, as reluctant assassin Jason Bourne, is my dream bodyguard: ripped, cute, tough but sensitive. German actress Franka Potente is in perfect counterpoint with Damon: she plays her character Marie with just the perfect combination of moxie and vulnerability. I thoroughly enjoyed the fight scenes in this film, which showcases the obscure Filipino martial art, Kali. Kali's style is far from showy. It's movements are spare and to the point, devoid of the sweeping arm movements and posturing so ubiquitous in today's standard issue fight scenes. And Damon makes it look so effectively brutal, other martial arts almost look effeminate in comparison.

The doctor has nursed the nameless one back to health but unfortunately was unable to cure a case of total amnesia.

With help from the doctor and a phony passport the nameless man travels to Zurich to investigate the bank account.  After gaining access to the safe deposit box the nameless man discovers that he is Jason Bourne of the Treadstone company and in possesion of millions of dollars.  Unfortunately opening the account sets off numerous bells and whistles to those monitoring the account causing Bourne to be stalked by unknown killers.
Bourne goes through minor epiphanies as people, places and things awaken forgotten memories that give him insight into his true identity.  He teams up with an attractive Canadian government financial expert who he initially used as a hostage to escape killers stalking him.  They fall in love as she helps him escape the bad guys and gain deeper insights into himself.

2331648,5,B0009WK5CW,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw ""The Bourne Identity."" Having never read the book or seen the TV miniseries, I knew little about the premise. In addition, I wasn't sure how well Matt Damon would do playing an action hero.
What I saw was an excellent movie with a great cast and terrific acting.
Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesiac who knows his name only because it was on a passport he found with his picture on it. He doesn't know where he has been, where he lives, or what he does for a living. The only thing he knows is that he found a safety deposit box that belongs to him with tens of thousands of dollars of money, several more passports, and a gun. Oh yeah.... and people keep trying to kill him.
Although the movie starts a little on the slow side (which was necessary to set up the premise), once it gets started it keeps going with barely a chance to catch your breath.
Another reason to like this movie: the director did not mess it up by inserting a pointless and unneeded love sequence. Yes, you know the two main characters will get together at some point. However, once we see that they are going to get together, we don't see them going at it. No scenes of them falling into bed together, and no scenes of them waking up together the next morning. More movies need to comprehend the idea of less is more.
This DVD Collector's Edition also contains several great extras. One of my favorites is the alternate ending which was apparently filmed and then, wisely, scrapped. In addition, you can view four deleted scenes which had been, also wisely, scrapped, and an extended farmhouse scene. There is also a ""Making Of"" commentary in this section.

2331654,4,B0009WK5CW,"I waited 5 months to get this book from the library, so I had a bit of frustration and anticipation built into getting to read The Bourne Identity.  I had seen the movie when it came out in the theater, but otherwise this is not a genre that normally interests me.  I decided that I wanted to read the book anyway.
While the book and the movie started the same, it became quickly apparent that the movie deviated quite a bit from Ludlum's novel.  The novel opens with two newspaper clippings about an assassin named Carlos.  It moves right into Bourne being shot and falling into the ocean.  He is pulled from the water and is put into the care of a doctor.  The doctor heals Bourne, but Bourne does not remember his past.  He does not know his name or how he came to be where he is.  All he has is an account number for a bank in Zurich.  It is with this knowledge (and the lack thereof) that Jason Bourne begins his quest to unravel his identity.  Bourne's actions are determined by the little information that he has, but he quickly learns that someone is trying to find him and kill him.  He finds out the name of a company that he thinks he works for, Treadstone 71.  But when I tried to contact this company, it doesn't exist...as near as he can tell.  However, the closer he comes to finding who he is and why he has all these skills (fighting, espionage) and memories that he can't explain; the closer he is to being killed.
Starting from the simple concept of one man trying to find out who he is, this book travels up the ranks of the U.S. Government to covert ops from the CIA.  The book also has the other side hunting Bourne: the organization of an assassin named Carlos (the Jackal).

Many of the action scenes were so boring I had to fight off sleep, which on secound thought would have been a relief so I would not have to suffer through any more of this movie.
 If you read the book you will hate this movie more than the people that did not. This was the worst movie adaptation of a book since The Firm. Carlos is not in it, instead the good guy from the book Conklin is the big bad guy.

2331656,5,B0009WK5CW,"I've seen some reviews say this film is based very loosely on the book by Robert Ludlum. Having never read the book, I started off with a clean slate...and MAN I LOVED IT.
This film is action packed from the get-go. There are a few setup scenes, but the film keeps you on the edge of your seat.
The film follows Matt Damon's character, Jason Bourne. He awakens floating in the Mediterannean with no recollection of his identity, as well as a couple of bullets in his back. He spends the film trying to find his identity, as well as the identity of those who keep trying to kill him.
I've never been a fan of Matt Damon's, but this film may be the one that win's me over to his side. I found his acting to be quite good.
The special edition DVD contains a few extras, including an alternate ending, which I haven't watched. I don't want to ruin it for myself. This movie is certainly not for children, as it contains copious amounts of violence, and some sexual content.
If you like action films, or even suspense, this movie is for you. If you like Matt Damon, ditto. If you like knitting, and peace and quiet, don't get it. Otherwise, add this one to your collection.",1053561600,,1168,4.337899543378995

The gist of the movie is described by others on this page so I will avoid repetition. However the reasons I like this movie are as follows:
 Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is cool calm and collected. I never would have pegged him for an action star but he carries his role admirably. You feel his confusion, his surprise and his disgust when he finds out who he is. He is also the calmest and most professional spy/protagonist I have seen in a long time.

The charaters modus operandii is refreshingly different. He reads a map to escape from a building, and values precision and speed over haste and unnessesary force (read hails of bullets).
 The female lead (Franke Potente rocks) is a solid individual. Most Hollywood action female leads are as follows; Screaming Ninny, Brave Toughy, or Spunky Girl. Here we have none of that, she is afraid but overcomes it, listens to directions, accepts her mistakes and provides a refreshing counterpoint to Damons paranoid spy, sometimes solving problems more simply and clearly than he can.
 The action sequences are fast moving and original with no unneccesary gunshots.
 The car chase is physically possible.
 Humor is sweet and not overdone.
 Peripheral characters are fleshed out enough to be interesting but not too much to distract from the main story.
In a nutshell. I found this movie treated me like an intelligent viewer rather that following a formula but without becoming ""arty"" and trying too hard.",1052006400,,1722,4.700996677740863
2331665,4,B0009WK5CW,"I'll be honest, I haven't read the Robert Ludlum novel, nor do I remember seeing the original film staring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. So I'm not able to point out differences or inconsistencies, if indeed there are any. Having said that, I can't imagine its predecessors topping Doug Liman's version of ""The Bourne Identity."" This is the sort of film I like to watch pretty often and each time I find something new to enjoy.

The plot, while nothing very original, provides a useful framework around which we get to enjoy some of the most believable action sequences I've seen. Let's face it, an assassin suffering from amnesia is not going to lead a dull life, particularly not after his ""friends"" decide he's gone rogue. There's only so many ways you can film stunts and action sequences like a car chase but Liman has  managed to somehow make the many action scenes seem fresh. I particularly liked seeing what looked like a mini-minor out driving the police using skill and good planing, rather than a high-powered engine or death-defying jumps.

Most of the movie follows Jason Bourne, (Matt Damon), as he tries to reclaim his life and survive to see each new day. In this way, the audience is allowed to discover the pieces of the puzzle along with him. On the way he forms an unequal partnership with Marie Kreutz, (Franka Potente). It is good to see a female lead portrayed without either weakness or an unrealistic macho streak. Hopefully, this film will launch Franka's Hollywood career because she has more than earned her stripes in German cinema.

Jason and Marie inevitably bond but despite not taking a major part of the narrative, I felt their stop-start romance suited the film. Perhaps a woman with no home makes a good match for a man with no past. I also liked the several times the couple tried to split up, to  get Marie out of Bourne's troubles but I especially liked the realism when they finally managed to part. The plot really doesn't need her but it seems Liman used Marie as a means of reminding Bourne that there is more to life than survival.

To some it would be nice to wake up one day and discover you were a sort of superman; able to speak half a dozen languages, had tens of thousands in a Swiss bank account and could out-fight Bruce Lee. His boss said it best when he described Jason as a $30,000,000 weapon. But more than advanced skills, Jason was gifted with intelligence and the experience of years of spy craft, even if he couldn't remember it. The thoughtful approach taken to achieve each objective, even on the spur of the moment, made the film almost educational. Hey, read a map before running from the police, use distraction and decoys to sidetrack you opponent, use the resources around you and think laterally. It's all good stuff for budding spies.

While Matt Damon played the part with little emotion, deliberately I assume, some of the smaller roles were outstanding. Each seemed to wring so  much depth from so few minutes of screen time that I felt like watching a spin-off movie for each of them. Probably the most affecting was the performance of Clive Owen, a fellow assassin who dies describing his constant headaches and bitter loneliness. Also of note is Julia Stiles, the overworked safe-house administrator; she exudes competence while complaining of limited resources. All of these performance gems must be a credit to Liman's direction.

It would be easy to dismiss ""The Bourne Identity"" as just another action flick. The action was great, but the true heart of the film was Jason's odyssey to reclaim his soul from the depths of a CIA black-ops hell. He used to be an amoral machine, doing his job without questioning the rightness of his work, just like the rest of them. But amnesia gave him the chance to step back from the abyss and evaluate his fate, eventually choosing to tear a new path into the future. The moral? Perhaps it's that ""freedom"" is more important than ""patriotism.""",1051660800,,3967,4.721098265895954
2331666,3,B0009WK5CW,"Not a bad movie . . . but not a particularly memorable one, either.  It's got a lot of good action, but there's very little exploration of the background or personality of Jason Bourne, despite the fact that this is the central point of the movie.  Instead, it focuses too much on being an action movie, with mysterious people trying to kill him for reasons unknown.
This is a rare movie in that the movie is better than the book.  The only thing the book did better was explore the complexity of the main character's past.
Pick it up some Saturday afternoon.  It's good for a few hours' entertainment- but if you want a movie that will be a little more memorable, grab the original instead.",1051574400,,691,4.4603174603174605
2331667,4,B0009WK5CW,"It seems as though this film/DVD has as many detractors as fans. The principal reason seems to be its faithlessness to the decades-old Robert Ludlum novel. Well, I believe Ludlum was an executive producer of the film, and think that he helped migrate the book into a slick script, which provides plenty of screen satisfaction.
At last, someone got the idea, that of an amnesiac spy, to the screen, as the first in what was a book trilogy, and will hopefully produce at least one movie sequel. A lukewarm version of ""Identity"" played on television years ago (think of the results if it starred Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith!). This version stylishly updates the story to today.
I felt that I saw another dimension to talented actor Matt Damon as the action anti-hero of the film, and thought his onscreen chemistry with Franka Potente worked brilliantly. Couple it with a fine performance from Chris Cooper, a jolting assassination, and one of the finest chase sequences I've seen on film....its a winner!
The DVD features are somewhat average, although anything filmed this slickly has a lot of interesting background material. The alternate ending was very disappointing.

I never got around to reading the book, so maybe I will check that out.  It seems like Matt Damon might have been a little too young to play this part, and I would have expected someone a little older, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.  I would have enjoyed just a little more story in there...things seemed a little too laid out in front of me at times, like they were feeding the story to me, but whatever.  Basically, this is the story of a spy who was thought to have been killed during a mission, but turns up sans his memory.  The agency he worked for, who thought he was dead, seems to have a special interest in not allowing him to live.  He has no memories about his past, but he has these survival skills and abilities that he finds he must use to stay alive.  He slowly starts putting the pieces back together, and discovers his true identity.  All in all, a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  I didn't really care much for the ending, but it didn't spoil the movie.

I haven't seen the telefilm yet, but I can't imagine it being better than this 'modern' version.  The film has weaknesses though.  Although the story moves right along with all the brevity and ferociousness of an action thriller, I can't help feel like it's all phony sometimes.  The little nuances that make a solid thriller move effortlessly and in a believeable way, like Sum of All Fears or Crimson Tide or even a Bond film, seems to be missing here.  An example was a scene where a foe of Bourne's decides he can't kill him and throws himself out a window in such a way that the audience explodes in laughter.  But this was not a 'funny' scene and that made me uncomfortable with the rest of the film.  Liman should stick to comedies and gen 'xer films.

The movie has that edgy, Mission Impossible, euro-feel to it but is very short on explanation and plausibility (Assasins are out to get them at every turn so Damon cuts Potente's hair so they won't be recognized, and yet never so much as wears a cap to disguise himself).
Nothing in this movie (acting, chemistry, plot) rises above the routine.  It's as if everyone involved in the movie agreed to sleep-walk through it knowing that based on the name and the actors it would do okay.  And it is ""okay"" for a renter, but not much more than that.

The thing that drove me nuts about this movie was that with the exception of the title and the Character names, there was very little in common with the book.  Bourne's whole reason for existing was deleted from the movie, and his true identity was remarkably reshaped.

2331674,5,B0009WK5CW,"I purchased this DVD just off of want I had heard about it. I must say that this movie does not disappoint. From the very beginning it locks you into this story of a CIA agent/assasin (Matt Damon) by the name of Jason Bourne. Bourne has no memory of his name, history, or profession. He was floating in the ocean with two holes in his back when group of men found him. He was thought to be dead by his superiors. As the story unfolds, he befriends a German traveler (Franka Potenta) who helps him in his quest to discover his identity. I will say that the action scenes in this movie are spectacular from the fight scenes to the car chases. The use of martial arts within the movie were pretty impressive and exhilirating to watch. Jason Bourne, while trying to find his identity, had to fight off attempts by his boss (Chris Cooper) to kill him and cover up his ""failed mission"".The use of technology in this movie is just superb. The computer gadgetry was top-notch. Bourne had a bank account implanted into his hip. Even once during the movie they were sitting in a cafe and he surveyed the place and gave feedback to Marie (Potente) within minutes. Even stating that two waitresses were left-handed and the best place to find a gun was in the cab of the truck outside. All of this and he still didn't know who he was. The action takes you from Switzerland to Paris and is a thrill-ride throughout. This movie just never loses you from the word ""Go"". The action is non-stop and Matt Damon does an excellent job of acting out the personality of Bourne with passion and convincibility-if I can say that. He looked like he could have boyish-charm, but deep inside he was a ""30 million dollar"" killing machine. I feel that Doug Liman did an awesome job in developing the story and the characters. It doesn't hurt that he had some great actors too. I think that Franka Potente is an up-and-coming star in the making. She's already got me saying ""shizer!"".

2331675,5,B0009WK5CW,"In The Bourne Identity, by Robert Ludlum, a man is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of France with bullet wounds covering his body and a severe case of amnesia. He is nursed back to health by a local doctor. When the doctor performs surgery, a piece of microfilm is found embedded in the patients back. It is a bank account number in Zurich. The man heads to Zurich to find his identity, but assassins pursue him on the way. In his account is a passport, hundreds of dollars and a gun. He finds his name on the passport, ""Jason Bourne."" Also, he finds his employer's name. A company based in New York called Treadstone 71. Treadstone is not listed in any business directories or phonebooks. He kidnaps Marie St. Jacques, a doctor staying for a meeting, to use as a shield. Jason saves her life, after nearly killing her numerous times, and they become friends. They travel to Paris together, where they find that the world's most dangerous assassin, Carlos, is hunting Jason. Jason knows he must kill Carlos from something in his blurred memories. Meanwhile, one of Carlos's men masquerades as Jason and sneaks into Treadstone 71, a covert operation inside the government. He kills several high-level government officials, one of whom was Jason's brother. The government believes Jason did it, and tries to capture him. As Jason and Marie question many of Carlos's operatives, Jason finds out that he is a highly skilled assassin, possibly more dangerous than Carlos. He is troubled by this fact, as he does not want to be a killer. Marie, however, refuses to believe him. As he gets closer and closer to killing Carlos, he finds that his assassin identity is nothing but a ruse to expose Carlos. Jason tries to get to New York to find Treadstone, which he believes will help figure out his identity. Carlos tries to get to Treadstone also, since Jason's reputation as a better assassin had lured away potential contracts. In a final confrontation, Jason reaches Treadstone at the same time Carlos does. They fight, but Carlos manages to escape. The government captures Bourne and he tells them about his journeys since a doctor off the coast of France rescued him. They believe him. He and Marie live happily ever after... at least until the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, which I haven't read yet.
 This was one of the best books I have ever read. It is action packed and keeps you wanting more. It is a bit confusing though, with all of the places and names to remember. It is 535 pages and is VERY intense. I can't wait to read the sequel.",1049760000,,2563,4.682926829268292
2331676,5,B0009WK5CW,"This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book ""The Bourne Identity"". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.

The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and  it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and  automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural ""Bourne"" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.

Matt Damon, looking very buff,  portrays Bourne as an intelligent,  resourceful  character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them.  Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.

This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale.  Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre.  This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.",1049673600,,2255,4.652392947103275

2331678,5,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne Identity is tightly crafted, gripping action-thriller with elements of espionage and fugitive films thrown in.  Despite its rather far-flung and somewhat murky plot, it delivers many thrills with intense and exciting action sequences.
The movie opens with Matt Damon's character floating unconscious in the Mediterranean Sea in the middle of the night.  He is rescued from the water by a passing fishing vessel.  The boat captain, who inexplicably owns a set of surgical tools, finds two bullets lodged in his back and a laser device implanted in his hip. When activated, the laser reveals a Swiss bank account number.  However, he has no knowledge of who he is and no memory of how he got there.
Upon reaching land, he takes a train to Zurich and accesses the safe-deposit box which, to his surprise, contains a stash of various currencies, several passports with his picture but different aliases, and a handgun.  He discovers that his name is Jason Bourne and that he maintains a residence in Paris.  Despite his amnesia, Bourne finds that he possesses superb martial arts skills and many uncanny abilities that would put 007 to shame.  Suddenly pursued by the authority, Jason convinces a distraught young woman named Marie to drive him to Paris for a ridiculous sum of money.  Marie becomes his reluctant companion after she discovers that her name and picture had become inexplicably linked to him.  Together they desperately race to discover his identity while evading mysterious and deadly assassins who hound their tracks. Somehow the key to his mystery is a flamboyant African leader in exile who publicly maintains that he's the target of assassination attempts by the CIA.
Throug most of the movie we witness events as they unfold from Bourne's perspective.  From time to time we see glimpses of Bourne's former superiors who try to track him down with high-tech surveillance and spy gadgets.  Bourne, in the words of his former boss, is a ""malfunctioning 30-million-dollar weapon"".  He is deadly armed and unarmed, speaks several languages, has superb observation skills and drives a car like a stuntman.  However, unlike Bond, his primary role is assassination; he and others like him operate anonymously and without glamor or glory. He doesn't get to save the world; he's just trying to survive.  In this day and age, the notion that such superagents exist and are employed by none other than the CIA is intriguing if rather far-fetched.
Matt Damon delivers a subdued performance and is credible in the title role, even though his boyish look belies somewhat his role as a professional killer.  Sometimes he appears lost and confused, sometimes he has a dangerous streak, but at all times he exudes cool-headedness and control.  He effectively conveys compassion hidden beneath a deadly facade.  Franka Potente, in her big-budget debut, is great as the love interest.  I've liked her ever since Run Lola Run.  Besides being attractive, she has an appealing mix of innocence and edginess to her.  As Bourne's former boss, Chris Cooper seems to have nailed down the role of a cocky, authoritative military figure that he portrayed in American Beauty.
The cinematography is excellent.  The European locations, primarily Paris, are gorgeous.  The actions are fast and furious.  In particular, the car chase through the narrow, crowded, maze-like streets of Paris is the most viscerally exciting in recent memory.  What's the fun of a car chase if it takes place over straight, wide boulevards with no traffic!  No, Paris is the perfect location, with its ancient cobblestoned streets and stately brick buildings; one gets a sort of guilty pleasure at such recklessness and mayhem.  There are no eye-popping pyrotechnics or stunt cars flying through the air.  Instead, what you get is furious, gut-wrenching twists and turns.  They were driving a Mini, and you can almost feel every jaw-rattling bump and jar.  In the end, you don't see a car flipping over in slow motion; instead, the fugitives scoot down a tunnel, switch off the engine, and let out a breath.  When they do, so would the audience.
The martial art sequences are exciting and highly stylized, with judicious use of fast- and slow-motion.  They almost remind me of The Matrix, but then again practically everything resembles The Matrix nowadays.  The climactic gun battle features an very cool stunt, one that would take the audience by surprise as much as it does the nemesis.

Yeah, the amnesia angle certainly has a bad rep, but the stylish film keeps the action rolling and makes it work.  Unlike MI2, there's no rock-video posing, no plot holes the size of Hummers, and no escapes from sticky situations that would make 007 blush.  It all fits.
And ultimately the mystery is solved for us all, of course, in a legit fashion that shows this action spy flick to have a surprisingly good heart.  The endings (both of them) seemed a bit too cutesy for me, and in two or three places the pacing of the film seems like the editing was done with the theory ""Let's cut to some action so they can't think about what a stretch that bit of business was,"" but all in all this is certainly one of the better films of its genre in recent memory.",1048982400,,986,4.28494623655914

We begin to wonder who the man is, why he is where he is and what his real mission will turn out to be.  Although this may be heretical, I actually thought the TV miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain and Jacelyn Smith was far superior to the movie version with Matt Damon.  When I first heard the casting for both versions I was disappointed.  But Chamberlain was a perfect Bourne, a chameleon, relentless and dramatic.  Smith was much more than a pretty face - she was a great costar.
The newest version suffers from an ailment afflicting cinema across the board - the worship of youth.  Matt Damon is not nearly as mature or old as the Jason Bourne in the book. Perhaps that's why those who do not read books enjoyed this version.
My only complaint is one that I have with other authors, but particularly Ludlum.  He has been copied so often and with such effectiveness that to be different his novels have grown longer and longer and longer.  I know this story could have used a good editor but I can't think of any parts I would want to cut.",1048809600,,1314,4.581196581196581

The movie seemed to be a lot of this guy (Matt Damon, who does not belong in this role, I'm sorry) running around and making out with this girl.  There was no dicernable plot, no recognizable conclusion.
Then I read the book, and was horrified.  I have truly never seen a worse butchering of a book by a movie, except perhaps Girl, Interrupted.  Not only were the characters distorted and flattened and the plot garbled and spliced, the most important character was left out ENTIRELY.
Read the book instead. If you haven't read it, you will wonder what the heck is going on.  If you've already read the book, you will want to hit your head on large amounts of concrete.

2331689,5,B0009WK5CW,"In the commentary on the DVD, Matt Damon admits that this production's intention was to make a gripping film, not one that is faithful to the book.  Director Doug Liman who did ""Swingers"" in 1996 & ""Go"" in 1999 accomplishes that with flying colors.  Tony Gilroy who was the screenwriter for ""Devil's Advocate"" and ""Dolores Claiborne"" works with W. Blake Herron to produce a screenplay that takes Ludlum's novel as a starting point.  The film is fast paced, moves quickly, is gorgeously photographed on location in Prague and Paris, and is a handsome DVD package to add to your collection.  Matt Damon as Jason Bourne surprises us with his action ability while showing the perplexity of someone suffering from amnesia, thrown in an ever-changing situation where his past literally threatens his every moment.  Chris Cooper who just won the best supporting actor Oscar for ""Adaptation"" and has played increasingly interesting roles in ""Horse Whisperer,"" ""October Sky,"" & ""American Beauty,"" does an excellent job as the manager of a secret program called Treadstone that networks assassins worldwide.  He becomes increasingly agitated until his assassination clears the way for Jason's ultimate freedom.  Franka Potente who played Johnny Depp's girlfriend in ""Blow"" and is a major German filmstar does a great job as the gypsy-like Maria who is enlisted by Bourne and becomes his willing accomplice.  Clive Owen who was so noticeable in ""Gosford Park"" doesn't have a lot of lines, but has one of the film's most memorable moments in his death scene in the wheatfield.  Julia Stiles isn't asked to do much, but is interesting in her supporting role as Nicolette who runs Treadstone's Paris office.  This is a film like a roller coaster.  The DVD's deleted scenes are interesting with the one with the psychologist being one I felt could have easily added to the film.  The alternate ending lead me to believe the director picked the right one, but was interesting to view.  I never was absolutely clear on why the agency insisted on Bourne's assassination.

The film rests largely on Matt Damon's shoulders and thankfully he has enough acting chops to make you believe the character. The compelling story lends itself well to a film, which, while not completly an out-and-out action thriller, contains some fantastically contrived set-pieces, like the exciting car chase and the final showdown where Bourne finds the answers to the thorny problem of who he actually is.

We were on our way back from dinner and decided last minute to stop and rent a movie and this was the first one to catch our eyes. It was about 20 minutes into the film that we realized this was going to be an awesome movie. There were so many cool action scenes. It is an ""edge of your seat"" spy thriller about a government agent who is pulled out of the ocean with two bullet holes in his back and turns out to have amnesia and cannot remember who he is. However, a bunch of natural instincts start coming to him, like when two cops confront him and he beats both of them up in like 3 seconds flat.
This movie has so many awesome action scenes. There is even a car chase with a Mini Cooper. The story was a little confusing and I still do not understand many parts of it, but the movie was so great that I really do not care.

2331694,3,B0009WK5CW,"Based on the bestseller by the late Robert Ludlum and executive produced by Ludlum and Frank Marshall, THE BOURNE IDENTITY pares down the book and 1988 miniseries while updating the story for the 21st century. For the few thriller fans in the world who haven't read the book the basic story appears rather old: an amnesiac struggling to learn his real identity, while predictably being pursued by people who want him dead. Director Doug Liman's (GO, SWINGERS) first attempt at an action thriller is fairly good with some spectacular stunt work and an OK performance from Franka Portene (RUN LOLA RUN). Julia Stiles also has what is basically a glorifed cameo and Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lecter also co-stars. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a good movie, but don't expect it to remain true to the book. Apparently there are plans to film THE BOURNE SUPREMACY with Damon. I hope that one turns out a little better. And I hope Damon has developed some kind of acting range by them. His Jason Bourne seems to have been ""Bourne"" prematurely. Not that Richard Chamberlain was much better in the role.

2331696,3,B0009WK5CW,"I really would give this movie 3.5 stars. Its direction is inspired, its pace is quick and fun, and Matt Damon does an awesome job.
However, having read the book long ago, I just can't get over what the writers did to the character of Marie. In the book, she is a brilliant, savvy financial banker, whose assistance is vital to Bourne discovering the truth about his origins. After she decides to trust him (because of her own keen observations and despite the fact that he does not trust himself), she would never leave him to his own devices. In the movie, she is basically... Well, not the most intelligent of women, a ""free spirit"" who is far less loyal than he.
The movie's changes also include a liberal slant in the plotline (i.e. government is corrupt and its goals evil) foreign to the original Bourne, wherein the CIA acted in good faith based on the best information they had, and Bourne was a truly good man who because of weird circumstances believed he was truly evil. In this version, Bourne never even discovers his real name, let alone his true self. He's just ""on [his] own side now."" And the truth behind his killer instincts is left unclear.
However, had I not read the book, these would be very small drawbacks. Indeed, they didn't keep me from enjoying the movie immensely. Its foreign locales, clever plot, and nonstop action make for a truly entertaining experience.
Oh, as for the extras on the DVD, they don't add much. The Moby video is interspersed with so many clips from the movie it's like watching the flick all over again, and the documentary doesn't reveal anything fascinating. (One question: Why did the director care that ""Run Lola Run"" star Franka Potente could handle the action side of things? All her character does the majority of the movie is hang on for the ride, scream at appropriate moments, panic, and wring her hands. Oh, and vomit and sleep with a [admittedly gorgeous] stranger.

And whoever took it upon themselves to tutor Matt Damon in the kissing scenes deserves a raise.  I had an ear-to-ear grin on, because I found I was expecting a certain kind of kiss, couldn't believe it when it unfolded just the way I wanted.
If the fighting closeups had been sped up just a tad less, and the corpse-as-an-air-flotation-survival-device been ELIMINATED, I would have given it 5 stars.  I simply found the movie vivid and refreshing.

I can say that I was pleasantly surprised. It's not too bad.
Now... if they could change the beginning, change his name and the title of the movie, along with the one or two scenes that are actually in the book, it would have been GREAT.

2331703,4,B0009WK5CW,"First off, when I first heard that they were making a movie version of Robert Ludlum's novel, I had mixed feelings. I had read and thoroughly enjoyed the book many years ago and knew that it had been adapted into a TV movie back in 1988, with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, although I have to confess that I never did get around to seeing it for fairly obvious reasons.
So why the mixed feelings? Partly because, for a variety of reasons, movies rarely if ever live up to the novels on which they are based. Maybe this is because we have our own rigidly set perceptions of what the characters look like or because we are already familiar with the plot. Sometimes studios rewrite the plots of our favourite novels and the movie adaptation ends up being so dissimilar to the book that everything that was good about it has either been lost in the editing, or changed to the story's detriment.
In the case of The Bourne Identity, the novel is a pretty substantial affair, full of plots and sub-plots, which would be pretty hard to cram into a mere 2 hours, without making significant changes. The Bourne Identity's script was reportedly written and re-written countless times. It took two years to shoot and, during this time, Matt Damon completed two other movies (Ocean's Eleven and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron). With this kind of background it is almost a wonder that this film was ever completed and as a result pre-release expectations were none too high. However, against all odds, Doug Liman (Go, Swingers) has produced a slick and competent thriller.
Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac found drifting in the Mediterranean sea after being pumped full of lead and left for dead. After being rescued by a fishing boat and nursed back from to health our hero sets off from Marseille with the intention of trying to rekindle his lost memories. Along the way, much to his bemusement, he not only finds himself pursued by shadowy would-be assassins, he discovers that he has skills and instincts that suggest that he himself may also be a ruthless trained killer.
So cue some great action sequences; several impressive fight scenes and an excellent car chase through Paris and enough of the original novel's twists and turns to keep the audience interested. Plus, throw in Franka Potente as an interesting female lead and unwilling companion, Clive Owen and Brian Cox in good supporting performances and two hours slip seamlessly by. However, although detractors will point out that The Bourne Identity is probably not the most memorable movie you will ever see (true), it is also fair to say that this is good old fashioned Saturday night at the movies entertainment and definitely worth a watch if you are looking for something undemanding. Matt Damon, excellent in The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting as a credible action hero?

There's no bracing stupidity on display here.
Unfortunately, while this approach dodges typical action bombast, it also manages to avoid much in the way of excitement. Moment to moment, the film is elegantly directed; individual action scenes impress, as does the naturalistic acting, and there are scenes of reasonable suspense.
But despite this, most of the film feels vaguely dull. There's just not enough story here. In the interests of style and believability, the filmmakers have stripped their tale so lean that there's not much reason to care what happens their characters, or down the backstretch even why Bourne and his CIA handlers behave as they do.
The Bourne Identity is extremely well-crafted, and probably the best film that could have been made from this script, but for all its cool, the end result is tepid. For a better stab at an intelligent, humanistic spy film, try Tony Scott's Spy Game.",1047168000,,1171,5.23404255319149

Needless to say it feels so good to be so wrong.
The Bourne Identity was one of the sleeper hits of this past year because of how effective it was.
Action movies fall in two subgenres...the Aronld action movies were he doesn't get hurt and if he does he's OK to run/shoot/punch/pilot a plane within a matter of seconds (nothing wrong with these types of movies).  Then you have REAL action movies.  The one where the hero could get hurt and the action is not overthetop unrelisticly.
The movie is put a great looking and sounding disc.  The extras are OK but I was really into the other ending.  If they claim it on the back of the box then it better be good and this one is.",1046563200,,992,4.267379679144385
2331716,5,B0009WK5CW,"Matt Damon has made countless good movies, and you can put The Bourne Identity into that mix.  This was one of the better spy movies that I have seen lately, and definitely ranks among the better movies of the year.  Damon proves that he can branch out and become a lead action hero and carry a movie without a lot of star power to accompany him.  Chris Cooper and Brian Cox were excellent, and so was Franka, but Damon stole the show.
The action scenes were brilliant and the directing was fantastic.  There was one scene that should have been cut, and I am not the only one to have mentioned it.  No person is going to use a body as a cushion and kill someone in the process of falling many flights of stairs.  But, besides that one scene, I have no complaints.
The Bourne Identity is a great movie that really captures your attention.  All I can ask is am I the only one that smells a 007 type of series appearing before our eyes?  Very worthy. 5 Stars",1046390400,,955,4.237569060773481

It's just not that believable.
And spy-thrillers, no matter how well done, are nothing new.
The Bourne Identity delivers its promise of being a cutting-edge modern day thriller, without the cheesy artlessness of formualaic blockbuster tripe.  Basically, everything is in place for a perfect movie.
Which is maybe why I can't give this movie four stars.  While it is definitely worth watching, showcasing loads of talent and energy, I came away from the movie feeling unchanged.  It was as if I had just watched a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"", and while it is truly exciting like that movie, it was done first by that movie.
In conclusion, this movie will entertain you for two hours, and you will have fun.  It is a rare action movie treat in it's unconventional take on the spy-thriller genre.

2331720,4,B0009WK5CW,"The story of 'The Bourne Identity' for me is Matt Damon's complete believability as title character Jason Bourne.  I didn't doubt for a second his 'fit' as a top-notch secret agent, capable of all manner of physical confrontation and quick-witted mental acuity.  He also sold me on the all-important case of 'amnesia' that drives the film.
I also thought Damon was eye-openingly good in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' especially given it was essentially the polar opposite of the celebrated South Boston poster boy he portrayed so perfectly in 'Good Will Hunting.'
Then, I try to imagine buddy Ben Affleck in each of these roles.  Laughable.  Keep your distance, Matt.  Smart career move.
The other story here is the continued maturation of director Dougie Liman.  [Son of late legal titan Arthur Liman, he of the famous unruly combover...and unlikely star of the Oliver North hearings.]  Liman takes a huge step here.

However, if you've never read the Bourne series, or if you're willing to forget the books, then this is a great little movie.  Matt Damon does a fantastic job playing the part of the amnesia suffering hero, Jason Bourne, who at every turn finds out things about himself that leaves him increasingly aghast - like the book, the movie makes a hero out a character that would be a murderous thug in any other setting.
Franka Potente plays the part of the mystified free-spirit who befriends Bourne (enticed initially by some cold-hard-cash), and eventually becomes an enthusiastic confederate.  I suppose it is too much to expect a movie to capture all the intrigue, maneuverings, clandestine subterfuges and treacheries that Ludlum wrote into the books - and it is probably proper that the movie really doesn't try.  It never could capture 10% of the first book in the length of the video - let alone the whole series -- but still this well worth seeing.  I do miss Ludlum's Jackal, but there's still lots of action, good technicals and not too much gratuitous vulgarisms, as well as superb acting.  Good high-drama flick!",1046044800,,1203,4.84390243902439
2331723,5,B0009WK5CW,"At first I was skeptical at the thought of Matt Damon playing any kind of spy at all. It had me nervous that he was in a Doug Liman film as well. Liman usually has fast paced cool movies, that have a huge element of cool to them. But when it came out, I waited in line for a first night viewing because of Liman's direction.
I am so glad that I did. Damon as the amnesiac Jason Bourne was a great casting choice, all my fears went unnoticed in this movie. It was fast paced and great. Franke Potente as the love interest was also good, as she played off of Damon's Bourne very well. The love story was not really a key point to the story and through out Bourne had a certain coldness toward Maria as he tried to get his life back together. The ALWAYS great Chris Cooper was in the movie as well and he played the leader of the orginzation very well.
The presentation knocked me out too. The country side and city wide scopes of Europe were a great back drop to this story. The car chase scene through the streets was not as great as Ronin but was fun to watch.
The only negative I really have in this movie is the ""What the Heck?"" casting of Julia Stiles. She seemed too cardboard in what could have been an important role.

2331724,4,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne Identity doesn't really do anything new as an action film. It just does what it does well.
This is just one of those fun flicks to watch, enjoy and quickly forget. In telling the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA super secret agent who loses his memory but retains his spy training and knowledge, the film doesn't break any new ground. It covers all the standard spy genre staples without getting too clichd (no outrageous spy gizmos a-la Bond), it tells an interesting story that isn't too overused, but formulaic enough to not be too stimulating, and provides ample excuses to bring on car chases and explosions.
Matt Damon adds a star to this flick, his presence always seems to raise the bar of any film he's in. It may not stretch his acting abilities, but it is fun to see him in the role of an action hero, even though his character doesn't remember he is. That amnesia is part of what makes Bourne work as a character. He isn't that confident, self-assured spy you usually get, he's confused and frightened by his physical and mental abilities. This theme of identity adds a lot to the film's atmosphere.
In a nutshell, don't expect anything but a good time with The Bourne Identity. It's not a memorable film, but it does it's job well.",1046044800,,1251,4.539823008849558

2331727,4,B0009WK5CW,"What a pleasant surprise this was!  I had originally hoped to see this when it came out in the theaters, but the multiple bad reviews I read and the two friends I had who disliked it made me take a pass on it.  Now, I am mystified why people disliked it.  I thought it was a first rate spy thriller.  I had only one serious complaint (a scene in which our hero jumps off an extremely high point holding a corpse underneath him to break the fall:  sorry, a corpse isn't a parachute and wouldn't have kept his body from being crushed by impact).  By and large, it was a thoroughly satisfying spy flick.
I never read the Robert Ludlum novel or saw the first version of the film, but I love the premise:  a man is found floating in the Atlantic with two bullets in his back and a tiny canister in his right hip, a canister that contains information about a Swiss bank account.  Gradually, the man, played by Matt Damon, learns that he possesses a perplexing range of skills with languages, fighting, using a gun, being preternaturally aware of his surroundings, and driving a car.  With the help of a young German woman, fetchingly played by RUN LOLA RUN's Franka Potente, he heads off to Paris from Switzerland, where, as they say, the plot thickens.  I like the way that Matt Damon manages to exude a profound sense of self-confusion while learning that his fighting and survival skills were off-the-chart.  He will accidently get into a fight, leaving two or three people severely injured, and he would be profoundly completely rattled by what he had been able to do.
I don't want to exaggerate the merits of the film.  It isn't a masterpiece; it is a highly enjoyable spy flick.  Everything is executed well, and of the supporting cast Chris Cooper stands out as Bourne's ""control"" in Washington, DC.  I think anyone who enjoys espionage or action films will find this movie well repays the time spent viewing it.",1045699200,,1913,4.555555555555555

Certainly, the Bourne Identity was one of Ludlum's better books, and the movie captures the helter-skelter, holding on by the edge of your finger tips tension found in the novel.
Matt Damon continues to surprise me with his ability to enter into different roles and pull it off. His performance as Jason Bourne is great. I particularily liked the scene in the Swiss bank where he opens up the security box and finds a dozen passports and lots of cash.
The fight sequences were believable (unlike the trend towards using wires and performing impossible jumps).

Yet he seems to already possess the knowledge needed to stay alive.  Can he outwit his opponents to find his missing memory?
This movie came highly recommended to me, so I couldn't wait to see it.  I was drawn in from the beginning and the action sequences had me on the edge of my seat.  I was also intrigued to find out what was really going on.  However, as the movie progressed, I began to get very disillusioned with it.  Jason keeps making mistakes that I knew better then to make.  And, sure enough, they get him in more trouble.  For a character that was established from the beginning as a smart spy, this really bothered me.

No. You have seen many movies of the same sort and yet, this movie is very good of its kind and extremely enjoyable. The movie moves in a fast pace and there is no dull moment. Matt Daemon portrays Jason Bourne - a young man trying to search his identity after being found at sea with nothing but two bullets in his back and a capsule containing bank details in his leg. He is surprised to discover certain ""survival"" abilities in himself and a lot of hostile reactions - all seem like pieces of a puzzle he has to build up. Jason Bourne starts his long journey to find who he is accompanied by a girl he meets along the way. Although the part could have easily been made up to be a typical ""macho"" role Matt Daemon is able to convey the confusion of Jason Bourne struggling to find his identity and is both charming and fragile. Franke Potante is adorable with her slight accent and the European scenery is indeed a change and gives the movie a somewhat ""refined"" and even ""sophisticated"" touch. The movie is not too violent and the romance between the couple is quite convincing. I fell in love with both of them in the hotel hair cutting scene. Reading the previous reviews I agree that not all is logical in this movie, but spy business always seem a bit of science fiction to me and I am willing to ""suspend my disbelief"" for the pure enjoyment which I received.",1045612800,,1513,4.293706293706293

But what made ""The Bourne Identity"" so good is exactly the above, with the addition of stunning visual, fast-paced story, and Franka Potente.
Even though we are exposed to many of the premise with a guy (or woman) who wakes up and can't remember who he or she is, but realize that he or she possesses superhuman abilities, hence go on a journey to find out what happened. ""The Bourne Identity"" is not so different, but without wasting too much time on the actualy ""search"", troubles come one after another for the hero. In another word, nothing in the 118 minutes feel redundant (with the exception of the love scene).
The dialogues are clever, the action is slick without going over the top. Every actors delivered an adequate job for the characters they are given. And one big surprise for Matt Damon who normally comes accross as the whiney wimpy guy is actually believable as an ex-assassin.
The DVD is a neat package itself. The picture is top-notch, and the thunderous soundtrack (especially DTS) is house shattering. However the extras are a bit of disappointment, there is an ""...-kissing"" making-of, a few interesting deleted scenes plus a ""stickier"" alternative ending, cast bio and production notes.

2331735,2,B0009WK5CW,"Fans of Robert Ludlum please avoid this movie.  The movie adaptation takes extreme liberties with the novel.  In the novel, Jason Bourne was an identity created by the US intelligence community in a counter mission to entrap the world's most notorious assassin, Carlos the Jackal.  After Jason is shot and found floating in the Mediterranian, Jason Bourne can only slowly recall pieces of that knowledge and we the reader don't know the whole story either.  What made the novel so exciting was the discovery process which we undergo with Jason.  We learn about his language skills, weapons training, and martial arts ability.  Is he a killer or at least a very dangerous man?  As Jason tries to piece together his memory, Jason forces Marie into helping him elude his pursuers.  Can she trust him when he says he won't hurt her?  It would seem inconsistent with his ruthlessness and training?  The tension present in the book was sorely missing in the movie.  In summary, the movie replaces this masterwork with a relatively simplistic tale of a CIA assassin with amnesia running ""off the reservation"" and creating a potentially embarrassing international incident that needs to be cleaned up.
By the way, the ""alternate"" ending is nothing but a teaser to sucker fans of the movie/novel to rent or worse buy this DVD.  I am offering no spoilers in saying that the ""alternate"" ending only differs slightly from the original ending.  The major improvement is the lack of corny dialogue which is replaced mostly by kissing.",1045440000,,1520,4.937007874015748

The plot is only related to the Ludlum novel -- the screenplay was morphed into a nicely claustrophobic character story about a small community of people up to no good, and the movie is cast to perfection with a wonderful collection of actors who deliver terrific performances. The director also directed ""Swingers"" and ""Go"", and his indy-film background shows through in quite a few scenes where the tension is heightened by the use of handheld cameras and shooting in real locations without a crew.
Damon is just outstanding as an amnesiac with a growing sense of dread about himself and his abilities, and Franka Potente has the presence and intelligence to bring off the character of the girl that helps him at first for money, and then later out of a combination of curiosity, tenacity, and aimlessness (she really doesn't have anything better to do).

Like Tom Clancey, his long and involved story lines do not lend themselves to a 120 minute film abbreviation.  The mini-series with Richard Chamberlin was fairly faithful to the book, this is like the Cliff Notes version, lacking both complexities and conherence of the book.  As a stand alone action movie with a passing nod to the original book, it's OK.  Matt Damon looks much too young for the seasoned spy, Jason Bourne, but he does a good job with what the script offers.  This is a good example of why so few of Ludlum's book became movies.  The film will be enjoyed far more by those who are not Ludlum fans. Don't expect the throw away toung-in-cheek wise cracks that make most action flicks fun.

2331739,5,B0009WK5CW,"Starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente, a beautiful German actress, The Bourne Identity is a huge success.  Fraught with intense action scenes and rich character development, this movie resounds with the passion of a high speed thriller that will bear many viewings.  I must admit to some trepidation about Matt Damon in an action role given his past roles, this trepidation doesn't bear out though, as he performs admirably in the role of a CIA assassin who has lost his memory.
The premise:
Jason Bourne is a CIA assassin who is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat.  He has two bullets in his back, an odd little laser device with a Zurich address and no memory as to who he is.  After two weeks on the fishing boat, he heads for Zurich and the search to who he really is.  Once he starts on this quest, he finds that he has some absolutely amazing skills and is almost immediately defending himself from being killed in several different ways.  He is then fortunate enough to find Marie, who he pays to drive him to Paris.  The quickly developed relationship between these two characters is quite beautifully filmed.
What ensues is clearly one of the best spy/action thrillers to come out in some time.  This films action sequences will leave you exhausted and the plot line will enthrall you completely.  If this is your type of genre, I highly recommend this film.

While Affleck seems to be getting into every mass produced piece of garbage under the sun Damon's selectiveness has seen him in some of the best films produced over the past few years.  The Bourne Identity is quite a step away from Damon's typical emotionally charged films and puts him in a more action oriented role.  He pulls it off convincingly.  His character, Jason Bourne, is plagued with amnesia and upon awakening has no recollection of who he was.  On his quest for answers he realizes he has certain talents that normal folks don't normally wield.  Damon's ability to really get the viewer inside the characters head is great here because unlike normal action films you can really get into this one.  Also his calm under pressure convinces you that this character was once something very feared.  The plot itslef is decent.  A nice conspiracy thriller with a few twists here and there.  unfortunately the film doesn't hide the solution too well and if you pay close enough attention, and have seen enough thrillers, you can figure it out.  The action scenes are well done and while not too ridiculous are well choreographed and Damon shows he really mastered the role.  The supporting cast doesn't employ many big names and this is a good thing.  The provide a great web of mystery as the plot unfolds and we even get to see Julia Stiles in an uncharacteristic role.

After having been left for dead in the Mediterranean Sea, Jason Bourne has no idea what is name is, where he's from, or what he does. The only things he knows scare him and he must find out what he used to do before assassins kill him.

A film about an amnesiac person involved into a chain of intrigues and plots is nothing new if you only remember ""Long Kiss Good Night""; the difference is, the pace of ""The Bourne Identity"" is, for modern audience, a little too slow, and except for the presence of character actor Brian Cox, it has nothing in common with Lenny Harlin's ridiculously pumped up action scenes.
The story is all too basic.  A guy who lost his memory played by Matt Damon is found on the stormy sea by Italian fishermen, and he seeks for his identity.  On his way through Eupope, he attactes unwelcome guests coming to elinimate him, but with unexpected physical and mental skills he fends off every attack made on him.  So, who is he?  Anyone?
This is so easy a question, so don't bother.  The point is, there are actions that might be seen in the spy films made in 1970s or before.  Sure, there are car chases, and surveillance system using computers, but the actions are all, as I said, old-fashioned.  And the fact is we have seen so many explosions and CGIs during the 90s (like ""Total Recall"" and any action flick you name), so the style of ""The Bounre Identity"" looks too old and stale.  But folks, originally, spies are supposed to be low-profile, so there's nothing wrong with understated handling of actions.  And the photography captures the atmospher of traditional European sceneries, in town and country.
But there are some complaints I have to make, and one is that the film is too, a way too, predictable.  Though Matt Damon is cast well, usually excellent actors like Chris Cooper and Clive Owen are all wasted as the characters that should be given more substance.  They look like desposable villains from episodes of any spy/action TV series, who are nothing but cypher.
And the other, and bigger complaint is the way of using female players, especially Franka Potente, ""Lola "" of ""Run Lola Run.""  There is nothing that reminds us of the energetic existence of the red-haired runner, but she is just a secondary role nobody really cares.  This is typical of Hollywood film when they use European actresses -- see ""Mission Impossible"" for instance -- and there again, they did it.  And if you brink your eyes, you will miss the lovely Julia Stiles (what is she doing here?).
As a whole agreeable, ""The Bourne Identity"" is, however, a kind of spy film that critics love, but not exactly all audiences.  But critics are those professinal people who have seen many older films, and that will explain.",1045008000,,2629,4.682608695652174
2331745,3,B0009WK5CW,"The first time I watched this movie I really didn't like it, based mainly on the ending.  Watching it again, though, I found it is an enjoyable flick with nifty action and a decent job by Matt Damon in staying in character.  Some parts seemed a little slow and drawn out between him and Franka Potente, but it didn't take away too much from the film.
  The DVD itself has good features for anyone looking for a little extra.  Overall it was a good film to sit down to and not concentrate too hard on, though it makes you feel that it is more complicated than it really is.",1044921600,,572,4.2110091743119265
2331746,3,B0009WK5CW,Those who read the Ludlum novel may feel this presentation is vaguely faithful.  There is some question if Matt Damon is the right Bourne for this movie? Certainly the movie in which Richard Chamberlain played Bourne is in some ways more like what Ludlum wrote.  Those familiar with Ludlum and what his novels try to communicate in themes relating to democracy and clandestine operations is not present in this movie.  In short not enough love went into the making of this video and for that reason it is difficult to figure out what if any point it makes? There is plenty of action and that is the sole merit of this Ludlum movie.,1044835200,,631,4.566371681415929
2331747,3,B0009WK5CW,"Watching THE BOURNE IDENTITY brings to mind numerous previous spy films in which an agent may be a turncoat and has to be brought in from the cold.  In order for this genre to resonate the audience has to empathise with the agent so that they can feel his concern and his peril.  Car chases, explosions, and exotic locales ought to be used to further cement the relation between viewer and hero, rather than divert the former in accepting the derring-do of the latter. What director Doug Liman presents is a non-stop action thriller that tries so hard to thrill that credibility goes out the window early on.
Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is a surprisingly youthful amnesia victim plucked from the ocean by Italian sailors.  He has two bullets lodged in him, yet after only two weeks he is able to do heavy physical lifting.  In a nutshell, these rapidly healed bullet wounds suggest the film's major weakness: the audience is asked to take Bourne's physical presence as reason enough to overlook some pretty big holes placed there by logical slugs.  Bourne does not even know that he speaks Italian, Dutch, French, or German until he faces native speakers of those languages.  His mastery of the martial arts is closer to the fighting of THE MATRIX than to any legitimate style.
There is a scene in which Bourne and a local woman (Franka Potente) are interrupted in a moment of passion by a hired assassin who battles Bourne in a manner more than suggestive of Robert Redford in a like situation from THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, complete right down to a knife sticking out of the assassin's shoe.  Further, the ongoing but futile attempts of the CIA to track what they deem as a turncoat agent seem a pale comparison to a similar hunt from DAY OF THE JACKAL.  What all these logical gaffes suggest is that to create a spy thriller a director need not do more than have a youthful and handsome hero, an equally attractive female lead, numerous hand to hand clashes, and frequent use of exotic locale.  The directors of THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and DAY OF THE JACKAL could offer Doug Liman some useful tips on how to do just that.",1044748800,,2124,4.58311345646438
2331748,4,B0009WK5CW,"Greek sailors find a man floating in the Med sea, take him in, and their doc finds a couple bullet holes in his back, as well as a laser capsule in his leg with a Swiss bank account number.  The man recovers, but suffers from amnesia.  Thus begins his quest to regain his identity.  Only, when he opens the security box in Switzerland, he discovers passports from half a dozen countries, wads of cash in various currencies, loads of cool spy gear, and a gun.
Soon the chase is on, from Zurich to Paris, as our man Bourne enlists the help of the German gypsy Marie (charming Franka Potente) and eludes the operatives sent by his CIA superiors until a stunning conclusion when he returns to Paris.
What I liked:
Great setting details of Europe, especially Paris.  There were a number of key action sequences, including a car chase involving a Mini taking on French police, and the wildest stairway descent I've ever seen on film.  I also thought Matt Damon and Franka Potente had good screen chemistry.  There was also a moving scene where Bourne confronts one the assassins on his trail, the professor, played by Clive Owen in a small part.
What needed work:
The hero with amnesia card has been played before, and I would have liked a little more development of Damon's character other than him realizing he had all these drilled in spy skills.  We never do get a sense of his likes and dislikes.  I liked the film ending over the alternate version, but both could have been better.

James Bond and Mission Impossible films have raised the bar so much that good films like The Bourne Identity struggle to remain in the minds of the theater patrons (i.e. avid movie goers). This is a good action movie, and the plot is difficult enough to pass the test. But as I said previously, other spy films are just so good they make it hard for others to compete. As a result, it makes all other movies seem not so hot. I only gave Bourne Identity three stars because I have seen so many other superior spy films as well as action films.

2331755,4,B0009WK5CW,"I have not read many of the late Robert Ludlum's novels, but this was a good place to start and I plan to read some more. Terrific action and characters; my only complaint would be that the book is actually overly complex and un-neccesarily so. The movie producers tried to remedy that by removing most of the best characters, such as the doctor in France and the retired general and his traitorous wife. They even took out Carlos and his henchmen and the Treadstone team. The left-over characters would be sufficient for a half dozen sequels and a weekly TV show!
Some would question whether one man could be shot this many times and continue operations but I don't like to worry about anatomical details. Ludlum is clearly a master of this genre, superheroes fighting many shadowy enemies in non-stop action, supported by one-dimensional female love interests, apparently based on 1940's movie stars. Dont look for any political intrigue or thrilling technical information. Ludlum tries to conjure up some international political and financial storylines and then seems to lose interest in them without completion.
Ludlum's true genius shows in the way he reveals the story to us.  Bourne has lost most of his memory in one of the many times that he is shot. The reader also steps into the story cold and learns page by page, who is Bourne and how did he get here. The movie does not handle this well, as it is too quick to get to the love interest and the battle with Bourne's former managers.",1044316800,,1496,4.731800766283525

Despite the only faint resemblance to the original novel (which I read during my sophomore year of high school and absolutely loved!!), the occasionally painfully lame dialogue between Bourne and his lady friend, and the Jackie Chan (I'm not a fan) action/fight scenes, this movie had enough brass to keep me interested in the theaters and then over the weekend on DVD.  Matt Damon is just a bit young for Jason Bourne, but he was fine.  The whole premise is either A) completely unbelievable or B) absolutely fascinating--take your pick.  It's just a movie, so I'll take B.  Remember folks, it's Hollywood, so don't get bogged down in reality. . . .
Bottom Line:  really good performances, the best chase scene in ages (maybe since The French Connection), and the chance to remember a great writer who churned out four or five amazing novels during that stretch of his career.

Matt Damon's acting is wooden, and the endless chase-fight-escape sequences just aren't believable. At one point, I half expected the big secret to be that Bourne is a cyborg, or specially enchanced human (a la ""The Six Million Dollar Man"") as this is the only plausible explanation for his invincibility.

It was great because it did not try to imitate Bond or Lethal Weapon style chases but was more reminiscent of the realistic car chases scene from the french connection. The storyline of the movie may not be so believable but the fight scenes and even the romance aspect of the film was well done. When I saw the book by Robert Ludlum in the store I didn't intend to read it but when I saw that it was actually a novel that the film was based on instead of a novelization of the film I decided to give it a [look]. The storyline is similar for the first half, except for the fact that the book is set in 1975, but by the end the two had no recognizable similarities.

If you're a fan of the book, unlearn what you have learned and enjoy the movie for what it is. Matt Damon shows us again that he is a gifted actor in giving the character of Jason Bourne a life that other actors may have just sleepwalked through. It must truly stink waking up one day and not know who you are. But to find that you can kick the stuffing out of two armed cops without breaking a sweat? That must be simply disturbing and Damon pulls it off without seeming to break a sweat himself.
And let us not forget outstanding supporting work from Franke Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen and the always dependable Brian Cox. These guys elevate this movie from what would have been an entertaining action flick into a great action flick.
The DVD is... okay, I guess. It's always nice to see some deleted scenes. The alternate ending isn't as alternate as it could have been (same result, different type of execution). The making of featurette is just that, a bit of a fluff piece that touches on some stuff, but never really goes deeper. The commentary by Liman is nice and imformative. He answers some stuff you may have been thinking about, like why is Julia Stiles in such a small role in the movie (when they were actually shooting the movie, she wasn't quite a name yet).

2331769,1,B0009WK5CW,"Like I say, I guess it serves me right for renting a movie like this in the first place.
See, Bourne is found by a bunch of Mediterranean-type fishermen, floating in the sea with a few bullets in him, plus a mini laser embedded in his thigh which, when cut out and turned on by the fishing boat's answer to Bones McCoy, displays a scanning-laser-written bank name, location and account number.  Kind of a lot of trouble to go to for information that could be more compactly stored on a folded piece of plastic, but I guess those guys at the CIA know what they're doing, right?  I mean, to judge from this movie, most of their crack staff appears to be about 17 years old.  You know, there's the kid in the home office who's coming on all seasoned about what blown agents normally do in situations like Bourne's.  I was thinking maybe he should've finished off his curriculum at Varsity High and got his diploma before he was recruited by the CIA, but what do I know.  And then there's his prom date, the girl who's stationed in Paris and acts like she's real competent and hardboiled while she looks like she should be popping pimples on her chin and worrying about taking her driving test.  I mean, do they take us for complete dundering [people]?  Apparently so.  Like in the scene where the CIA section head gives a boiler room pep-talk to the staff about Bourne's whereabouts.  He says, ""He's located... here"" and he puts a red push pin into a small map of France, pushing it into the place where Paris would be.  Hey, thanks, chief.  That's a big help.  Right after this he gives the assembled twelve year olds some rah rah BS and says, ""I wan't you to get everybody up, up, get them all up we got to move, up, up"" and as he says this he bodily hoists a corpulent black man to his feet.  It is clear from the man's expression that he has no idea why he is being brought to his feet or what he is supposed to do.
But anyway, back to Bourne.  So Bourne, when he comes to on the fishing boat with the swarthy sailors, he don't remember nothing, see.  Got amnesia from those bullets in his back or something.  Now, time out for a second here.  Raise your hand if you have ever in your life known anyone who has ever had amnesia.  Right, just as I thought.  If it weren't for hack writing, we'd never even know the condition existed.  But to judge from movies if you were to walk into a room and do eeny meeny miny moe every third guy wouldn't know his own name.  Its a real scourge of our time, this amnesia.  Just like multiple personality disorder - what is usually totally erroneously referred to as schizophrenia.  Yeah, it seems that psychiatrists working in nut farms will rarely come across one legit case of MPD in twenty years.  But I guess if they were working in tinseltown, they'd find the disease as common as grass.
Well, not to worry, Matt Damon gets a clean bill of health in that regard.  No trace of any heterogenous personality emanations.  He's the same drink of water he always is, and about as colorful and interesting.
But, meanwhile, back on the fishing boat, you see these swarthy foreign sailors unaccountably have a soft spot for American-sounding guys with a bunch of lead and laserbeams in them and not the slightest clue.  But as Bourne explains, his habits have stayed with him.  And indeed, before our eyes he begins doing pull-ups from the mainsail or whatever.  I guess for him doing pull-ups is like a reflex action.  Funny.  I do my fair share of pull-ups and I always have to force myself.  Note to Hollywood writer: exertion does not come natural.  But anyway, so this Rocky-esque training sequence on the fishing boat was real inspiring though.  They really should have developed it more, like with Matt Damon clad in a sweat suit running laps around the tiny ship, then working out by punching the [heck] out of the freshly netted fish, till they all fall out of the net, right back into the drink with the fishermen all looking admiringly on.  Thought bubble for random fisherman: ""And to think he doesn't even know who the frig he is.""  Real inspiring.  Goosebumps.

In ""The Bourne Identity"" we meet Jason Bourne, who by all means is lost and has no idea who he is, but has amazing abilities and knowledge that you would expect from a secret agent.  This novel is extremely fast paced with a new twist every chapter.  I will say that the writing is a little advanced and the story can be confusing, but as long as you read it strait through you will get it.  I would definetly suggest not for you to read this book on and off, if you do, you will be as lost as Jason Bourne is.
You really get placed inside of Bourne's shoes in this novel, which is a great feeling when reading.  I really felt as if I was the one being chased, and could not put this book down for one minute.  I would stay up all night just find out what was going to happen next.
You will love this book if you are a fan of spy novels or anything by Tom Clancy.  Dont let yourself pass this novel by.",1043712000,,1154,3.982608695652174
2331775,5,B0009WK5CW,I loved this movie.  It kept my interest the entire time and it was thrilling and exciting and suspensful.  Matt Damon does a great job and looks good doing it. As a collector of DVD's this is a definate addition to my collection.,1043625600,,230,4.325581395348837

Understated and fantastic in the action sequences. His German co-star is also excellent. It is a masterful piece of film making. Sure, it may may cross over from ""film"" to ""movie"" in places, but all in all it's a completey satisfying spy movie. Well shot. Well directed. Well edited. And marvelous sound design. In short, it rocked. Oh yeah, if you want something truer to the book, there is an earlier version of this movie starring the action movie staple Richard Chamberlain.

2331780,5,B0009WK5CW,"This is one of those movies where random elements came together to make the movie special. What I mean is: it turned out better than most had expected. There is a lot left to the imagination in such a way that you are not disappointed but actually surprised at it's appeal because you end up filling in the gaps by yourself in a way that is the most entertaining to you. Maybe it's just me, but the Bourne Identity is my favorite movie of 2002.
With that said, you won't be disappointed any way it's sliced. It's a spy movie with a ruthless plot and realistic motives that are actually kinda chilling. Nice production value and killer acting. punya. enjoy, don't miss, buy because everything else coming out right now is l-a-m-e (01/03).

2331781,4,B0009WK5CW,"THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a tightly conceived, well directed, well photographed and particularly well acted suspense thriller loosely based on the Robert Ludlum best seller.  True, many liberties have been taken from the novel, but when you take the time to note that Ludlum himself is the producer, then all arguments are off.  Matt Damon and Franka Potente are terrific as the amnesiac agent and his 'only friend' who helps him escape a mad and endless chase from multiple groups of would be assassins.  The characters are well developed - Damon gives one of his better perfomances, doing most of his stunt work himself while Potente continues to prove she is an actress worth watching.  The supporting cast of such fine actors as Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, etc help propel this movie along.  Outside of the French Connection this is one of the best car chases ever filmed - gratefully without the now-boring background of explosions and destruction.  In all a fine film that is delivered on DVD with interesting  and informative sidebars.",1043539200,,1036,4.953757225433526

This is misleading to say the least, as it is simply a variation of the original ending that changes it in virtually no significant way.  So, don't buy the movie for this reason.
Here is what you do get:  Matt Damon as a likeable action hero with a conscience. A female lead that seemed grafted onto the script. A movie with many, many plot holes.  Good action sequences.  A car chase where the cars don't automatically explode when they crash (bucking the Hollywood trend there). And yes, a predictable ending.
All in all average popcorn munching fare, good for a watch but that's about it. If your tastes run towards spy adventures set in Paris, Ronin offers a much more satisfying experience.",1043539200,,852,4.7687074829931975
2331783,4,B0009WK5CW,"""The Bourne Identity"" is a well-crafted, reasonably intelligent spy thriller that is akin to the classics made in the 1960s and 1970s. It has high energy moments, like an elaborate auto chase through the streets of Paris, but it eschews the flashy, over-produced special effects of movies like `XXX' in favor of greater focus on the characters and the story. While the plot has a number of hard to believe elements to it, it's still intriguing enough to keep an audience well entertained.
The crew of a fishing vessel discovers an unconscious man [Matt Damon] floating in the water off the coast of France. He has two bullets in his back and an odd little gadget sewn into his hip. The man recovers physically but is plagued by amnesia. Using the gadget, the captain learns that their passenger has a numbered bank account in Switzerland. Later, after making his way to Zurich, the confused victim finds out he is John Borne, American resident of Paris. It's more complicated than that, though, because he also uncovers several other passports. Is he Borne, is he someone else, or is he all of these identities? At the American Consulate, he learns one more thing: He is a wanted man whom some group wants to assassinate. Enlisting the aid of a German girl, Marie [Franka Potente], he makes his way to Paris. There, both he and Marie are in even greater danger. He establishes that he was a CIA agent, and, as his memory slowly returns, he comes to understand that he was anything but a nice guy.
Damon does a great job of playing an action hero. It's an interesting role for him, almost but not quite as multi-layered as his part in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley'. He and Potente make an excellent on screen couple, both in the action scenes and the romantic ones.
The movie was directed by Doug Liman, who also did the cult classic ""Swingers"" and the wonderful [and little seen] ""Go"". He brings a modern feel to an old genre. Adding to the film's appeal is the excellent photography, which was done on location in Paris, Prague, Switzerland and Greece.",1043539200,,2049,4.662983425414365
2331784,3,B0009WK5CW,"For those of you who loved Robert Ludlums book, the Bourne Identity, I do not recommend this movie. I loved the book so much I bought the movie based on my liking for the book and other reviews I had heard. I was extremely dissapointed. This movie is so horrendously different from the book they should have called it some other title and in captions said, ""Based on Robert Ludlum's THE BOURNE IDENTITY.
I was so disapointed in the outcome of this movie. For those who read the book you will surely remember Carlos, Virilis (the French guy whose wife works for Carlos), the clothes store, and the church where Carlos relays information. None of these are in the movie. In fact I counted about similarities, the names of the main characters, Treadstone 71, that Bourne was a weapon, and that he was shot in a yacht in the beginning, and the bank in Zurich where Bourne gets a lot of money. That's pathetic.
For those of you who wonder why I give this 3 stars, it is a great action movie, with some cool stuff, like the car chase and the scaling of the wall. If you were a fan of the book, I wouldn't waste your money unless you rent the movie first.",1043452800,,1148,4.344186046511628

All they did was use the Title of a best selling book to sell a movie.
I give it 1 stars as an action movie.  No stars are awarded for screen adaptation of the book.  If this was not a blatant attempt to sell a movie based on title recognition it would have more stars.

And how did they get to be in love all of a sudden? In the book Jason needs Marie. She keeps him sane. And he saves her life. That is really not so in the movie. And what happened to Carlos the Jackel? He wasn't even metioned in the movie, probably because it was set in the present instead of the 80's. But that was all the book was about! There are so many things different about this book and the movie that this review would be like a term paper if I decided to name them all.

This does not detract from the story, however, and in this department, Ludlum deliveres an action packed thrill ride. It seemed that I could actually feel the mental and physical turmoil of Jason Bourne. This book is a good read. Not ""Beach Reading"", but more of an in-depth read.

While ""Bourne"" didn't have any huge twists, I didn't care.  I wanted to see how this man with no history would survive his past and move on -- assuming he survived.  Plus, this is a movie you can talk about without having to compliment the special effects -- which, unfortunately, are half the comments I hear about ""Minority"".

It's one of those books you will not be able to put down, and you may skip a meal or two to finish it in one sitting, so find a cumfy chair. Two subsequent books: The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum by Robert Ludlum are both good, but not as good as the first. Ludlum books have a style that I enjoy, but I've decided that it's as if they're written to formula, so more than one Ludlum book a year makes them less enjoyable. One Ludlum book a year is very nice to read. The 1988 tv-miniseries version of this movie with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith was OK, but I thought that Bourne lacked the skills portrayed in the book, although he did have some of the brains. The 2002 movie with Matt Damon is just the opposite with Bourne having all of the skills (here's a guy you do not want to meet in a dark alley, or even a crouded policeman's shooting range), but none of the brains. In 2002 the female sidekick shows that no smarts at all is enough to stay alive, whereas in the book anyone without 100% amazing training gets wiped out very fast -- and the need for both honed skill and brains is what gives you the respect for the book Bourne.

Matt Damon is credible, Robert Ludlum's plot is zippy, the central performances are solid enough (though the supporting cast is flakey, and the usually reliable Chris Cooper is plain ludicrous as Captain Trunk of the FBI).
However, any pretensions the film has to be anything more than a rehash of number of typical seventies euro-thrillers is bogus.
For one thing, the suggestions in the media that the Bourne Identity is ""novel"", ""imaginative"" or ""refreshingly free of cliches"" are way off the mark. I could barely see anything but retreaded cinematic technique: balaclava clad commandos abseiling through closed windows; the surgical removal of bullets, dropped clanking from forceps into tin dish, maniacal car-chases - clattering down stone staircases in Mini Coopers, if you will - cloak and dagger intrigue in the streets of old Europe: it all harks respectfully back to a time when for a film to have true class, it had to have Roger Moore or Sophia Loren in it.

Matt Damon (of ""Good Will Hunting""/""Saving Private Ryan"" fame) delivers a dynamite performance as Jason Bourne; a CIA operative whos failed assassination attempt of a world leader causes him to be put for extermination by his own company. Coming from near-death, without any remembrance of the past, Bourne embarks to find and retrace why he is in the situation, he is, while battling those that seek to end his life. All this with the skills and techniques that are provided to him by being a CIA Op. Franka Potente (lead of ""Run Lola Run,"" the best German film of the 90s: if you haven't seen it, check it out ASAP) is amazing as Bourne's penniless sidekick. She is smart, sexy, and a perfect compliment to Damon. They are an excellent pair together! This movie is amazing for its great dialogue, witty and charismatic cast, and non-stop action sequences. Chris Cooper is quite good as Bourne's former boss, who wants him dead ASAP. And, an upcoming star in Julia Stiles makes a brief appearance as a CIA employee. On top of the cast, the film is gifted with excellent cinematography. Set primarily in Paris, it has the ability to take that city that many Americans know well and transform it into an exotic masterpiece, ala Budapest or Prague. The camera angles of the scenes are fantastic, giving the audience plenty of excitement, as Bourne climbs down walls and beats his way through security officers. All in all, this is a movie that everyone will like. It is the action highlight of 2002, with maybe the best chase scene in the history of film (and that includes the 1971 classic: ""The French Connection"") And, what makes this movie so much better than let's say ""XXX,"" is that Damon is believable as the smart, witty Bourne and his action sequences are riddled in athletic ability, then an overdoing of special effects. This film is quite believable, which adds to its aura. Definitely check this movie out, by all means. Built on a strong novel, it's a smart film, with a great cast, beautiful cinematography, and nonstop action. The action of film of 2002: ""The Bourne Identity.""",1039651200,,2214,4.738341968911917

I recently re-read this book, having a vague recollection of reading it way back it the early '80s, to refresh my memory on it before going to see the movie of the same title that was released this past summer (I enjoyed the movie immensely by the way).  It's a fun and exciting read, given all of the action, chases, violence, etc.  But fundamentally it deals with someone trying to find out who he really is as defined by his past.  And as the story unfolds and wraps up it seems to figuratively place a question mark on this approach - are you who you are because of what you have done in the past, or what you are doing in the present?

2331824,4,B0009WK5CW,"Critical Review:  The Bourne Identity
 In my opinion, after reading this book, I feel that Robert Ludlum is the proverbial father of suspense, holding his own with such writers as Alfred Hitchcock and Stephen King.  The book, the first of a trilogy is written magnificently leaving endless opportunities to expand on future sequels.  Ludlum has an uncanny way of grabbing the reader's attention and keeping him eager to continue.  The plot thickens early, wasting no time to express deep thought.  The author leaves much to decipher, not spoon-feeding information; done commonly in less quality works of literature, boring the reader to exhaustion.
Jason Bourne the protagonist has a very disguised role in the novel.  Although struck with amnesia, Bourne has a very smooth and calm way of executing his actions.  Bourne's ability to stay mild mannered is a perfect counter balance to all the far-fetched and extravagant plots that arise throughout the course of the novel.
Throughout the novel uncertainty keeps the reader intrigued.  Bourne is constantly fighting a battle; not always physically with other characters, rather mentally against himself.  The never-ending dilemma between good and evil is a major factor in this book.  Slowly learning more about his past, Bourne is realizing the life he led is not the one he wants to lead.  From this point on in the book, Bourne is fighting to get out of the line of work that made him into what he is. ""Jason Bourne had been paid to kill, and the police in several countries had sent funds through Interpol to convert reluctant informers, to broaden the base of his capture (Ludlum, 94).""  With the help of Marie St. Jacques Bourne starts his transformation.  In reality, The Bourne Identity is an incredible suspense thriller, but if you take a closer look, its really just your basic stereotypical love story with many obstacles and twists, boy meets a girl, boy has four million dollars, boy asks girl to drive him to Paris, and they fall in love.
Bourne, right off the bat, is portrayed as a superhero, almost immortal, having the ability to endure the icy wrath of the ocean and the lead that is temporarily residing in his head. ""The boat rolled violently leeward and the and the man whose skull was ripped open plugged over the over the side into the madness of the darkness below (Ludlum, 1)."" Bourne's flawless execution is a little overdone at times and casts a shadow of artificiality on the storyline. The novel is quite unrealistic at times though, for example, Bourne's amnesia was in a sense limited, his name, age, identity were all lost in his accident, but his ability to combat was in tact as well as his illusive clever nature. ""Jason dropped to a crouch, spun to his left and lunged out of the aisle between two adjacent cars, breaking his fall with the palms of his hands, the maneuver made in silence (Ludlum, 426).""
To conclude, The Bourne Identity is a literary masterpiece, setting a mold for all future suspense thrillers to come. The book is directed towards more of an intellectual audience, with gaps in the story that only your imagination can fill. Each person will take his or her own individual thoughts and opinions from this book. I stand strong behind this book, and would recommend it to all readers with interest in deep thought and suspense.",1038787200,,3334,4.857142857142857

I think one of the things I liked about it was the characters and what they go through in the book.  Jason Bourne is my favorite character in this book.  The emotional things he has to go through are interesting, and educational at the same time.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes Robert Ludlum, or spy thrillers.",1038441600,,450,4.36144578313253

And Matt Damon?  As Jason Bourne?  I don't THINK so!
If you want to see a somewhat entertaining example of this genre, rent -- don't buy.  But if you are a purist (or at least like your book to movie translations to be recognizable) you won't care much for this one.",1038355200,,481,4.409090909090909
2331827,5,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne Identity
In the opening paragraphs of The Bourne Identity a bullet ridden body is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea by fishermen.  The half dead man is hauled onto a fishing boat and examined by a drunken doctor.  The doctor discovers an I.D. number etched in this man's back. The man with the bullet wounds survives but suffers amnesia. His only clue to his identity is the I.D. numbers the doctor found on him. Later, in a Zurich bank the I.D. number matches a bank account and storage box in which he finds money, weapons and passports with the name Jason Bourne. Then he discovers that he is supposed to be dead. Confused, he holds hostage a woman, named Marie, and together they set out to find out who the man Jason Bourne was.
The author of this book Robert Ludlum, is amazing. One of his strengths is an ability to give an incredible portrait of the main character's thought process along with descriptive details. For example, in one passage he writes,
  ""A crack. Outside the room.  Snaplike, echoing off into a sharp coda, the sound  penetrating, diminishing in the distance. Bourne opened his eyes.
  The staircase. The staircase in the filthy hallway outside his room. Someone had been walking up the steps and had stopped, aware of the noise his weight had caused on the warped, cracked wood. A normal boarder at the Steppdeckstrasse rooming house would have no concerns.
  Silence.
  Crack.  Now closer.  A risk was taken, timing paramount, speed the cover. Jason spun off the bed, grabbing the gun that was by his head, and lunged to the wall by the door. He crouched, hearing footsteps -one man- the runner, no longer concerned with the sound, only with reaching his destination. Bourne had no doubt what it was; he was right.
  The door crashed open: he smashed it back, then threw his full weight into the wood, pinning the intruder against the doorframe...""
Another strength of Robert Ludlum is his ability to create a believable plot; though the stories are outrageous, he can still make the reader believe them. In one chapter of the book while going through files Jason Bourne finds a story containing a theory of JFK's assassination and in my mind it is still a possibility.
Although he has many strengths, in this novel there was one weakness. In a few passages the place and setting was not explained. It was as if he left it to the reader's imagination to picture the setting. This seems to be his only flaw and it is pretty minor.
In conclusion, I thought this book was extremely intriguing and it was very hard to put down. This was because every chapter there was more information about Jason Bourne and I wanted to find out more. It was a novel filled with cruel villains and wise officials who either helped or impeded Jason's findings. So if you are drawn to action and suspense thrillers, read The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum.",1038096000,,2882,4.677227722772277

If you haven't read the book, read it! Even though it was written in the '70's, it is still a good story.

It turned out I was wrong because while the plot was pretty good, Ludlum cannot write for nuts. Seriously, I wince when I read the dialogue. Characters have no chemistry between them. I cannot feel Bourne's anguish because the writing is so technical. I felt that throughout the novel, rather than having an atmosphere of despair as Ludlum wanted to convey, all i got was he throwing it in my face that yes, poor bourne, poor thing.
This book gets a 3 stars for the nice action and plot. If you can ignore the poor writing, it does make for a rather good read especially at the end. Oh and i don't plan to read the next 2 books.",1037059200,,882,4.224852071005917

For example, she gets kidnaped by Jason, held hostage by him, he theatens her with a gun, he hits her several times, another man rapes her, and a few days later she's all ready for a relationship ...  Now if I were her, I think I'd be developing some serious trust isues, not jumping some injured spy. This Ludlum guy obviously doesn't know much about women.  Not to mention all the ""My love, you cannot leave me"" ... I had to stop reading it about 200 pages in.  Do yourself a favor; skip the book and see the movie.(Marie [is cool]in the movie).",1036540800,,790,4.22
2331832,4,B0009WK5CW,"...that was pretty good for an action film to begin with. The story of an amnesiac who is driven to think he's a dangerous killer is full of suspense and lots of neat twists that almost never feel contrived. Even though the book is over 20 years old, it rarely feels dated (granted, from time to time you wonder why the hero doesn't just use a cell phone).
A few minor gripes: somtimes, the klanguage the characcters speak seems to be straight out of a romance novel. This gets better during the novel. I liked the character of Marie in the movie, where she was very convincingly portrayed by Franka Potente, because she was quite unusual for an action movie sidekick. She's even more interesting in the book, even though I could have done without her stilted language. Her complete change from victim to accomplice which looks very strange without reading it almost makes sense.
I didn't like the italics which convey the character's thoughts and are far too repetetive. I didn't care too much for the ending, too. I'm told all will be settled in the third installment, which I will tackle after finishing the second.

He's a little too much of a ""pretty boy"" and seemed way too young.  The other agents, those assigned to kill him, were much more believeable.  Now, I haven't read the book, but I've heard plenty about it.  The Professor, the assassin that completed Bourne's failed mission, was supposed to be his equal, if not superior, in skill.  However, the Professor was done away with in about 5 minutes, by Bourne.  And lastly, I can't stand when a character gets kicked, punched, sprayed with glass, etc., and never has the slightest bruise or cut.  He falls down several flights of stairs and doesn't even get an ankle sprain.  I understand Bourne is a top agent, but he's not armor plated.  These are nit picky things, I'll admit, but I'm a pretty harsh movie critic.  On the positive side, I did like the story and 99% of the casting.

2331836,5,B0009WK5CW,"The Bourne identity is quite possibly Robert Ludlum's greatest work.  Ludlum exemplifies his genious in both the big picture and the small picture of his story.  He manipulates the reader through a terrifying amount of dizzying twists and turns that leaves the reader satisfied.  The dialog is written in such a human manner that the reader can easily relate to the characters in the story.
  The story begins with a chilling account of a man being shot of the side of a boat during a storm in the Caribbean.  After native fisherman find him near-death, a curious but generous doctor performs surgery on him and helps him to recover.  When he awakens from his coma, he cannot remember anything about himself or his past life, including his own name.  However, the doctor removes a microfilm implanted in his leg that has a bank account number of a Swiss bank.  The man follows this lead.  When he arrives in Europe, however, he finds himself robbing innocent people at gunpoint in order to gain a few thousand dollars.  Because he is instictively doing this, he assumes that he is either a terrorist or an assassin.  The Swiss bank account contains the name ""Jason Bourne,"" as well as millions of dollars and a few weapons.
  Amidst Bourne's own confusion of finding out his own identity, he is being hunted by an Carlos the Jackel, a legendary assassin who knows his identity and will do anything to kill him.
  Throughout the novel, Bourne is trying to escape American intelligence agents.  Without giving the story away, the agents mistake Bourne's actions as negative to them, and therefore they are trying to kill or capture him.
  The only light in Jason Bourne's life is Marie.  Jason meets Marie by taking her hostage and ordering her at gunpoint to drive him out of the area.  She at first dismisses his story that he has amnesia as psycho-babble from the lunatic that he seemed to be, but later believed his story.  Marie turned out to be an accountant from Canada.  Marie provided Bourne with money that he needed in order to dodge both Carlos and the CIA and to find out his true identity.",1035849600,,2101,4.680327868852459

I was glad that the producers decided to go with a respected actor like Mr. Damon, instead of some B-Movie beefcake with great abs and little acting skill. The movie is a pleasurable experience and is done in such a way that it prevents the film from feeling dated. The amnesic assassin is considered cliche, but that does not keep the movie from being entertaining. Ms. Potente has good chemistry with Matt and movie does not turn overly sappy with the love interest element in the story. The movie has one of the most enjoyable car chases in movie history. This too is done with such style that it keeps the viewer from feeling jaded in the ""seen this before"" sense. If anything, I wanted the movie to have a little more action. My only real complaint is the waste of Julie Stiles in this movie. The very beautiful and talented actress is in perhaps 3 scenese. She plays an espionage tech operator in the search for Jason Bourne. I rate this one of the classiest and excellent spy noir films of all time.

The movie keeps you interested and engaged, with only a little silliness, at times.  Franka Potente is a very fine discovery, as she and Matt have very good chemistry together.  The car chase scene in this movie ranks among the very best of all time!  What is it about European settings that make car chase scenes so awesome (such as in Ronin!)  Matt is believable enough in the fight scenes, and the action has a nice pace to it that keeps things interesting.
Not having read the book, I am able to enjoy the movie for what it is: a smart and interesting spy movie.  Having read the other reviews, apparently the movie producers did more slicing and dicing to the original novel than a chef at Benihana's.

The only other comment I have is why is there such a lag between the dvd release dates of this movie, and The Sum Of All Fears, which were only released a week or two apart in the theaters?

Unfortunately the author's inelegance makes parts of the book tedious and even onerous.  I found myself rolling my eyes at several of the situations the characters found themselves in, and was incredulous at the murders at the ""top secret"" office in New York, coupled with the totally unbelievable ""fingerprint on a glass"" bit of evidence planting.

Ludlum did several things very well -- the basis for Bourne's existence was well thought out and plausible, as was Cain's mission (raison d'tre).  I appreciated how he handled the character of Marie, making her competent and intelligent (and an economist!) rather than a typical damsel in distress.  I imagine his scenery and setting were accurate, although those details added nothing to the story as far as I was concerned.

He's been shot twice in the back, and has a strange device implanted in his hip, a laser-pointerish thingy that shows a swiss bank account number. When Bourne awakens, we get that old movie cliche....AMNESIA!!! (Cliched, yes, but it works here.) The movie follows Bourne's efforts to not only uncover his identity, but also find out why so many people are trying to kill him.
 The movie is pretty long, but the brisk action scenes and snappy plot keep things moving. Director Doug Limon does a good job, and the cast is excellent, especially Chris Cooper (As Bourne's slimy boss), and the original Hannibal Lector, Brian Cox, who adds gravitas to every film he's in, even if it is a small role.
 Two problems- Matt Damon's fight scenes are sped up almost to the point of distraction. I appreciate the fact that Bourne is supposed to be a step above everyone else, but the fights just looked....off somehow. And I hope Julia Stiles has some heavy-duty ""Deleted Scenes"" on the DVD, because otherwise it just seemed like unnecessary stunt-casting to have her here at all.

Ludlum's novel is chock full of suspense, thrills and kills.  The action seems almost non stop, but remarkably, there seems to be room enough for a well executed plot.
The story moves along with the action and Ludlum only lets the reader know enough to be only a couple of steps ahead of Bourne.  We find out pretty much as he finds out.  Another thing the author does well is put our hero (or is he an anti-hero?  You'll find out soon enough) into situations that the reader has no idea what he can do to get out of it.  And the really cool thing is that sometimes, even Bourne doesn't realize he's in these situations.

Now if I had failed to read the book three days before seeing the movie I probibly would have thurrowly enjoyed it.  But unfortunately I kept on thinking to myself, ""What about Carlos?""(The antagonist in the novel)  I don't mind it if a story is diverted from the plot of a book, it can work out for the better, considering that they are different mediums.  But when you have a book that is laced with brilliant plot lines and the movie throws them away for inferior plot lines-that makes no sense to me.  The movie had brilliant action sequences and Matt Damon truely shone, but i am still upset with what this movie could have been and was not.  I recommened that you see the movie first and then read the book susequently, you will enjoy them more that way.  The only real corrilation between the two is that there is a man with amnesia named Jason Bourne.  I don't want to say any more-it will give away too much of the twists and insights.

But I absolutely loved the movie. Not at one part to I get bored, i have already seen it 3 times. Matt Damon's portrayal of an ex-assasin with amnesia is wonderful. Franka Ponete was also an excellent Marie.
If you have already read the book, it is important for you to not go into the movie thinking you're going the ""see"" the book's story...you wont. THere's no Carlos, no Delta, no Medusa. THere is a Treadstone, and a Cain, but it is spelled differently in the movie.

That said, I loved this movie! I really think of the movie and the book as two completely different things, that just happen to have the same title.
Matt Damon is great in this film. He is the amnesiac Jason Bourne who is looking to find out what his true identity is. Along the way he gets the help of Marie (Franka Potente). However, his job is made difficult by the fact that the CIA is trying to kill him.
There are some great action sequences in this movie, including an awesome car chase in this little beat up car. Also, Bourne has to fight off an attack using only a pen.

2331855,5,B0009WK5CW,"After finishing this novel, I promptly ran out and picked up The Hades Factor. This was surprising for me, considering I don't normally care for spy novels - I've tried to read LeCarre, and, to my knowledge, have never actually managed to finish one. I guess that's some sort of bar as to whether the novel's any good or not.
The plot is simple at first, but grows more complicated as the twists and turns continue. The main character, who we later learn is named Jason Bourne (I hope that's no spoiler), washes up in the Mediterranean Sea and has no memory. He's not without his gifts, though. He is fully trained with weapons of all sorts and has military-like reflexes. He acts without thinking. The novel follows him closely as he wanders instinctively into the world and tries to find out who he is. At every stop, somebody is hunting him. He needs to find out why. (I hope I'm not saying too much in disclosing that he will eventually tied in with a network of assassins, who compete for supremacy.)
I found the novel worked on several levels for me. I particularly liked the moral dilemmas Mr. Bourne had to go through early in the novel, when he's just finding out who he is (or was). He has people he doesn't know firing at him - does he fire back? how does he know they're bad? He has to take a hostage to stay alive, but how far should he go? He doesn't know what he's done, what he's wanted for - is it worth killing an innocent bystander for? And, of course, what if, in his past life he actually had deserved to be killed? Could he risk bringing somebody into his world knowing this?
There are also issues with loyalty and personal loss. Even in the extreme distress of their situations, the characters are able to dig for deeper meaning, in people's eyes, and in their hearts. It isn't all guns and politics. I found the loyalties between some of the characters very touching, as when Marie St. Jacques stands by Jason because he saves her - even thought he'd previously held a gun to her head.
Of course, there is the standard fair share of shooting and running and all-round suspense. At every turn, there's something forcing Jason to keep his wits about him and make impulse decisions. It all makes for a great read.

2331856,3,B0009WK5CW,"This fast moving thriller serves up beautiful European scenery in Zurich and Paris and points in between.  My companion complained of it being too visually ""dark,"" (the sun never shines), but I felt mid-winter dreariness in Europe was at least no worse than say Michigan at the same time of year.
Matt Damon is amnesiac, Jason Bourne, who was left for dead floating in the sea with two bullets in his back, was saved by some good hearted fishermen.  The audience (but not Jason) quickly learns he is an assassin for a mysterious government agency code named ""Treadstone,"" and he has failed to accomplish a mission.  Jason is marked for assassination by the agency to protect its existence.  The chase is on!  He finds he has a Swiss safety deposit account with a sheaf of passports and millions of dollars in various currencies.  He meets a penniless girl, Marie (Franke Potente) who with a certain amount of ambivalence, agrees to drive him to Paris for $20,000.  Jason is in the classic ""you can run, but you can't hide"" situation.
The film keeps up a fast pace with a wonderful car chase and has a ""startle"" scene beyond compare.  (Jason and Marie are taking a quiet breather in a safe apartment when an assassin crashes through a large window almost on top of them.  I think I self-levitated about three feet out of my seat!).  Ms. Potente is a delight as Marie; quirky, funny, highly nervous interspersed with deep resigned calm.  Her presence brightened every scene.  Matt Damon is miscast as a trained assassin.  He comes off as an All American Boy too young for the role.  There are loose ends that are never satisfactorily explained or even commented upon. (Why discard a warm jacket only to shiver through the next five scenes?  Why not replace the bright red bank bag that stands out like a signboard while running around Zurich?)  The biggest problem with the film is the only one who is mystified is Jason Bourne.  The audience knows exactly who he is and who is chasing him from the beginning of the film.  The manner in which he failed his mission seems unlikely and falls flat.
If expectations are not too high, I recommend this as a good summer film.  It doesn't have pretensions of grandeur and can be enjoyed for exactly what it is.",1029196800,,2251,4.638888888888889
2331857,2,B0009WK5CW,"If you read Ludlum's book, and are hoping to see how the big screen portrays the crafty story of a deep ops agent trying to regain his memory, forget it. There is no Monk, no Delta, no Cain, and no Carlos. The only similarities between the move and the book are the names Jason Bourne, Marie, and Conklin, and the beginning of the movie. Bourne, nearly dead, is found by a fishing boat and nursed back to health in two weeks to begin his quest towards Zurich.
With each passing minute of the movie, it becomes less and less like the book. This new story line takes away several dynamic aspects of the novel. First, you lose the opportunity to see Bourne's resourcefulness. Instead, we are left with Damon's character's driving ability and deadly fighting techniques utilizing a Bic pen. We also lose Bourne discovering himself throughout the book as each incident that he survives helps trigger a thought or an idea from his past.
Either Liman didn't know how to pull off Ludlum's vision, or Hollywood doesn't think audiences can handle anything beyond the action formula. There is nothing original about this movie. If you've seen ""Total Recall"", the ""Long Kiss Goodnight"", or any one of the amnesiac action movies in the last ten years, you've already seen this movie.
If you've read the book, skip the movie. If you saw the movie, and liked it, you'll love the book. If you haven't done either, get the book, its better and cheaper. If you just want to see a spy movie, wait until the next James Bond comes out.",1028505600,,1514,4.611111111111111
2331858,5,B0009WK5CW,"This film draws the audience into the mystery of the character played by Matt Damon. The character awakes in a state of bewilderment not knowing anything about his past including his name. The film leads us through the development of retracing his past from brief clues gathered along the way. Yet, while he is trying to reacquire this past, he faces a dilemma, namely the person he may find in the past could turn out to be something he really despises. In some sense, this is a second chance to become a different person than what he once was, to reshape a new character and avoid the pitfall of his past all the while avoiding assassins sent to end his life and without knowing why they are trying to kill him. His instincts to survive are uncanny, well worth seeing the action sequences and cleverness. Accordingly, I would strongly recommend this film as the best current film of the early summer.

2331859,1,B0009WK5CW,"So *this* is the best-of-genre, best-of-author novel, correct?
I'm not impressed.  I'm disappointed, actually, and so thoroughly frustrated by two rampant flaws in Ludlum's work that I found it hard to finish the book.
One, Ludlum has constructed a plot with so many poor and impossible devices that I now see why the genre had acquired a bad name.  *This* novel may be the progenitor of all bad cliches for spy thrillers; if not, it certainly represents the pinnacle of achievement.  Example: the protagonist's companion has an omniscient ability to root out the intent of the US government; more likely, Ludlum found no way to tie in his loose threads other than to make her a forensic genius.  Or: the convenience of all encounters working to our protagonist's advantage.  The general who sees something trustworthy in his face, the woman who sees something courageous in his actions, neither holding any grudges or connecting past behaviour to the present.  Can you say ""inconsistent""?
The characters are unbelievable.  It's as if I'm reading a parody, but since it's played straight, it's even worse.  For Ludlum to play off these ridiculous characterizations, his tongue would have to be *through* his cheek and not in it.
Two, and this is by far the most egregious, is that this novel was far, far longer than it needed to be.  The pacing is uneven; the beginning was hyper and subsequently, all chapters seem subdued in comparison.  However, the necessary buildup for the next part of the roller coaster is wholly inadequate.  And the complexity of the plot is unbelievable, both in scope and execution.  There's a secret government agency, but it's imbued with good people; there's a secret assassination cartel, but it has admirable ethics; the protagonist just happens to hook up with a beautiful woman who falls in love with him - loves him! - in a matter of a few weeks; the protagonist consistently outwits a professional killer, apparently just by going to school for it.
Oh, would that I could get back the time spent in reading this thing.  The reviews for this book serve as poor indicators of what's to be found; let this sacrificial review be a warning to readers of Andrew Vachss, Stephen Hunter, even Tom Clancy.  You'll find no consistency or solid writing here.  Don't pay to read this book.",1028073600,,2315,4.884910485933504

For a while, though, I was alright with it until, through every scene, I kept explaining to my friend what really happened in the book. By the end of the movie, it was nothing like the book.

  Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie. There was action everywhere, what with the car chase scene and a lot of the fight scenes.

Matt Damon plays a superspy who has forgotten everything about his past.  On his quest to find out about himself, he must evade assassins and protect Marie and try and stay alive.
The plot isn't that important other than to answer the question of will Bourne find out who he is and why people are trying to kill him.  The on-location filming make this movie fun to watch, but the action scenes are the best parts.  They are filled with suspense and realistic violence.  This movie isn't filled with computer generated violence and special effects.
It is a throwback to the old Bond movies of one-on-one cloak and dagger standoffs.  While taking a step back from the special effects, The Bourne Identity might be enjoyable to many people today who weren't alive when the goals of movies was to be bigger and better than the last.

First let me say that I exited with the desire to see this film again as soon as possible while my counterparts were highly disappointed with their choice. I did not see the huge plot holes that are mentioned by other reviewers. The fact that it is called the Bourne Identity only tells us that Bourne is the identity that he stumbles onto first. He could just as easily stepped into another life. The action is outstanding and the suspense mounts perfectly.

2331863,2,B0009WK5CW,"I will try to keep this short and sweet. The action sequences are well done (the camera work actually makes Damon look like he can disarm multiple assailants). Unfortunately, the plot is full of holes and leaves you feeling unsatisfied. First, how likely is it that a trained killer will have a change of heart at the crucial moment? (maybe after he's slaughtered the whole family). Second, I still don't know how/why Damon/Bourne suffered from amnesia. It's true that he suffered from some trauma, but complete oblivion? Give me a break. Finally, why on earth did Potente (sp?) stay with Bourne/Damon and risk her life and that of her family? It makes no sense whatsoever. At least with a cheesy Bond flick you know that you are in the realm of the absurd and that you should just sit back and accept implausiblity after implausibility. But when a movie makes a claims towards verisimilitude/reality, and fails miserably, then it deserves to be panned.",1027468800,,953,4.852760736196319
2331864,4,B0009WK5CW,"Yeah, Matt Damon is in this movie.  Yeah, it's got a happy ending.  Ya know what?  It doesn't matter.
""The Bourne Identity,"" based on a classic 1980 espionage novel, stars Damon as an amnesiac fished out of the Mediterranean Sea by a trawling vessel.  The ship's doctor removes two bullets from his back and a strange infrared device from his hip - a device that projects the account number at a Swiss bank.  After spending two weeks aboard the ship and recovering , Damon makes his way to Zurich, where he discovers that he is apparently Jason Bourne, and American who has a dozen passports and millions in foreign currency, along with a gun.  He's also discovering, slowly, that he has training in the art of espionage - fighting, shooting, and getting away.
With the James Bond franchise becoming more and more of a self-spoof and a serious lack of decent spy fare since the end of the Cold War, it's a pleasure to see the return of a great action genre.  ""Bourne Identity"" manages to weave a believable sense of paranoia while introducing enough gadgetry (although it's more of the MacGuyver kind than the Bond kind), nifty fights, and amazing escapes to satisfy.  It's not great, but it's decent enough, and Damon is almost a pleasure to watch in the action-hero role (and the subtle, sexy Franke Portente manages a wide character range in her relatively minor part).
It's worth a trip to a matinee; if not a rental should you happen to miss it.

Besides finding out his name, he also finds in his Swiss box money, false passports, and a gun. With the help of a German gypsy, Marie (Franka Potente), he goes on a trail to find out his real identity. Unfortunately for him, assassins have a new target... him!
""The Bourne Identity"" most certainly falls into the category of a spy thriller, a new venture for Matt Damon who is the star of the movie. Throughout the movie I was very impressed with his spectacular fight scenes, obvious that he had training in kickboxing, karate, and firearms, using the skills like a 'born' natural (no pun intended :). His acting is also well done, from his expressions, emotions, and even showing the lack of both. Franka Potente is also a good love interest in the movie. She displays both nervousness and strength in her character. Other notable stars are Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, and Julia Stiles, though their roles are very small.
Of course the movie has spectacular action and fighting scenes, mesmerizing you throughout the film. From car chase scenes and foxes and hounds chases to hand to hand combat fighting and gun fighting, you will be tense with excitement and suspense! One of the interesting things about the movie is the car chase scene. Well, we all have seen probably numerous car chase scenes with the hero in a cool sports car, Matt Damon as Jason Bourne drives a mini cooper! Now that was interesting! But some of the fight scenes are a bit violent, especially the end, hence the PG-13 rating.
The movie is not all action, there is actually a pretty neat plot! The story is based on Robert Ludlum's 1980 bestseller so you can rely on ""The Bourne Identity"" having an intricate plot with lots of twists and turns. But one thing that disappointed me was the conclusion. The end was a bit confusing, making you wonder what in the world had been going on? Maybe it was me or the ending didn't seem to make sense. But I think the filmmakers are just making way for the sequel which I expect since ""The Bourne Identity"" is only the first in a trilogy. The other two sequels are ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"".

2331879,3,B0009WK5CW,"I saw the 1988 mini-series of THE BOURNE IDENTITY (BI)when it originally aired.  I thought it was a great production and could have been released on the big screen.  That film version stuck much closer to the original novel.  Richard Chamberlin was in his early 50's when the film was made.  In the novel I got the impression that Bourne was in his 30's in the early 70's and a Vietnam War vet.  If you adjust the story to fit in with the 1988 setting of the first film Chamberlin is roughly the same age as Bourne would have been in 1988 if you use the book as a baseline for Bourne's age.  I only bring this up because to remain faithful to the book Bourne needs to be a Vietnam vet and there is no way you can make a present day movie and have Bourne be a Vietname era vet.  He would be in his 60's and that would detract from the original story line.  So, I knew from the start when I found out that Matt Damon would be starring as Bourne that either the producers were going to set the film in present day and drastically alter the story line or, as I hopped they would do, set the story in the early 1970's and stick to the original story line.  Of course the producers chose the present day option and in doing so made a horrible mistake. Spoilers are listed in the comparison between this movie and the book.
1.  In the book the physician that saves Bourne after he washes up on shore.
2.  In the book Bourne kidnaps his female companion.  In the film he politely asks to use her & her car.  This really undercuts the tension between these two characters as they fall in love.
3.  In the book Bourne transfers his money from bank to bank.  In the film Bourne carries it around in a bright red bag that is sure to draw attention to himself.
4. In the book Bourne tracks down his identity even as he tracks down the world terrorist Carlos.  In the film Bourne seems to have clues brought to him by the bumbling assasins that can't hit their mark and Carlos is never in this movies storyline.
5.  In the book the secret orginization Treadstone and it's founder David Abbott are key elements of the story.  The relationship between Abbott and Bourne is critical to understanding why the world's intelligence agencies want Bourne dead.  In the movie Treadstone is never fully explained and nor is the relationship between Bourne and Abbott.
I could go on and on with the differences.  However, I do think the producers deserve some credit, especially after seeing what THE SUM OF ALL FEARS (TSOAF) producers did to that book.  They kept the story in Europe.  Bourne still had amnesia.  He outwits his persuers.  All in all it is not a bad film.  I just think that if a studio is going to make a movie based on a novel they should have a little bit more of the novel in it.
The 1988 film will be released on DVD in August 2002 so If you want to see a BI that sticks faily close o the book check that one out.",1026432000,,2910,4.237749546279492

Then the hot sexy scene, thrown in just for laughs, The spy that can disarm the police at will, disappear in seconds, and leap tall buildings in a single bound (but can't hold on to a sack filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars and all his id) graps the scissors and starts hacking at the young supple hottie costar's hair.  In minutes she looks like she just spent four hours and a couple of C-notes in a Beverly Hills Salon and they of course proceed to make hot passionate love (off screen).
The movie is very loosely based on the book (a guy who can't remember who he is finds himself being hunted down and it turns out he can kill with ease).  The dialouge is labored through out:
""Are you alone?----tell me!""
Blank stare.
""Are you alone?""
""I work alone, just like you, hey, do you still get the headaches?""
Blank stare.
""God what they did to us, the headaches, when I'm driving it feels like the back of my eyes are going to pop out, blah, blah, blah.""
If you didn't read the book, or don't care if a movie based on a book totally changes just about everything, and you don't mind watching car chase scenes that look like they were copying (or worse spoofing) a 1970's Bond film and you can stand poor dialogue and a stupid plot, then go waste 7 or 8 bucks at the movies.  I'd recommend waiting untill it hits the video store or better, when it's run for free on one of the networks in a year.
If you're interested in seeing this book developed into a decent screen play then buy or rent the tv miniseries.
This movie doesn't have an intelligent strong woman (a Canadian banker if I recall correctly) being taken hostage by Jason, it has a ditsy, young cutie American student hard up for cash hire herself out as a taxi driver to an obivous felon.  It doesn't have Jason (the supposed bad guy) going back to rescue said Canadian from rapists, and thus proving he is good inside, instead it has young ditsy cutie  getting herself deep into trouble.  The Canadian decides to help Jason because she belives he is a good man and is falling in love with him, not so in the movie.  The Canadian is smart enough to help Jason find his real identity, is able to stand by his side because she knows he has integrity.  The movie really changes everything about the relationship between the two.
Anyway, in the real book, Jason was trained to flush out and kill Carlos the Jackal international killer.  In the movie there is no Carlos.  In the movie Jason has become an actual assasin, totally changing the entire premise and point of the book and making the character out to be something totally different.  In the book, well, never mind,  the movie is nothing like the book and just plain stunk.  Don't waste your money.  I'd give the movie a ""D"" and only rated it two stars out of sympathy and because the two stars are somewhat entertaining and I can't blame them for the foul script.",1026345600,,3400,4.373015873015873

It was about a hit man who lost his memory, and is now trying to find out why so many people are after him and why he has so many different passports.  He is in for a lot of suprises.  I reccomend it to any action film fan.  The reason I only gave it three stars is because it had an awful ending and I didn't like the female lead.",1026345600,,376,3.844155844155844
2331892,4,B0009WK5CW,"Robert Ludlum did a fantastic job coming up with a unique story. The book opens with Jason Bourne taking a bullet in the head on a boat in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. He is rescued from the stormy waters by a group of fishermen who take him to the local doctor. The doctor repairs our man's wounds and nurses him back to health. When Bourne is finally awakes from his comma, he discovers that he doesn't remember a thing, not even his name. The doctor starts Bourne on his journey with a piece of microfilm with a Swiss bank account number on it, and the realization that Bourne's features have been changed recently by surgery and that he speaks three languages. We also find out that Bourne is deadly in the arts of hand-to-hand combat. If this isn't enough to get you reading, it's time to find a different genre of books to pursue.
Ludlum is a strong writer in the action, deception, and overall plot sense. Unfortunately, he is terrible at character interactions. The female character, Marie St. Jacques, and Bourne feel as if they were forced together by the author because it was the only way the story would work. There is very little tension between the two of them, even when she was with him against her will. She is also entirely too bright, able to guess many of the things from Bourne's past. I think Ludlum was concerned that his audience might lose their way, and Marie was there to give them the inside scoop. My only other complaint about the book is Bourne's ability to attract bullets. He has more holes in him than most cheeses.
The plot is good. There are several areas were it is a little weak, but the momentum of the book carries you through these areas before you realize that there is something wrong with it. This is a very good action thriller that will keep you reading well past your bedtime. Ludlum let's on Bourne's past in such a way that you keep reading to find out more about him. The Bourne character is fairly well developed, with quite a history behind him even though we only see it in brief glimpses. Bourne is a good problem solver and great manipulator. We learn a lot of Bourne's motivation even though we never quite understand what is behind the other characters' actions.
This seems like it might have been originally a complete book, but someone got the idea that this could easily be turned into a series. Therefore, the ending isn't as strong as it could be, leaving obvious gaps to be answered in the subsequent books. This is one of the better books that I've read in a long while. I do recommend it.",1026259200,,2562,4.488222698072805
2331893,4,B0009WK5CW,"Okay, I admit it, I saw the movie, then decided to read the book. I am a big fan of anything involving spies, yet had not read anything by Robert Ludlam until two weeks ago.
First off, the movie and the book part ways in the scene when Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean. From that point on, the main character's motivation is the same, the past history seems the same, but the two stories are completely different. I loved the movie, I thought it was great, and hope they can make a franchise out of it. I am not sure how well it will work, given that a big draw is the man trying to figure out who he is.
The book is very good. The story is clever, the characters are very well developed. It is a page turner, which means you might be going to sleep late if you start reading it.
I finished the book last night, and will probably pick up the next one on the way home from work today.",1026259200,,892,4.045197740112994
2331894,4,B0009WK5CW,"I thought this movie was better than most give it credit in the previous reviews.  It was certainly entertaining and at times clever.  Damon is actually believable as a superspy with amnesia.  The plot is intriguing.  The action sequences are excellent.  The car chase really is extraordinary - I don't remember a better car chase in any film I've seen.  Additionally, the viewer is never really allowed to feel that Bourne is secure.  There is little letup in the tension throughout the film.  Suspenseful isn't really the right word, but you get the feeling that a bullet will tear through a wall at any minute, or an assassin is hiding behind the next tree, which kept me interested even through points which other reviewers considered slow.
I was also impressed with the fact that - with one disappointing exception (staircase scene), Damon really never does anything superhuman or impossible.  People criticize the film for copying The Matrix, but I never really got that sense.  He doesn't punch anyone and send them into a triple-twisting somersault.  He doesn't leave the ground and kick three people before landing in a pretty pose.  When he beats would-be assassins, it is often by doing something tricky or clever, sometimes athletic, but never superhuman.  His skills are made more believable by some dialogue in which he explains to Potente what is going through his mind as he attempts to discover who he really is and why people are trying to kill him.
I was also unaware of and intrigued by the minor twist at the end of the film.  The twist is unremarkable, but satisfying enough to differentiate it from the other spy-thriller films of this genre.
A good movie that was the best I've seen (between it, Star Wars,  Minority Report, and Spider Man) on the big-screen this summer.",1026172800,,1795,4.839344262295082
2331895,4,B0009WK5CW,"First, let me say right off that if you've seen the movie, you do NOT know the plot of ""The Bourne Identity"". The only two things that were taken from Ludlum's book were that the protagonist is an amnesiac who apparently is a living lethal weapon, with all sorts of people trying to kill him; and that the name of the woman he kidnaps and who eventually falls in love with him is named Marie.
Beyond that, the plot of the movie is nothing like the plot of the book.
I had gotten bored with Ludlum over the last few years, because most of his stories followed the same basic formula - innocent foil uncovers global conspiracy, which then sets out to silence him. Along the way, he picks up an incredibly gorgeous woman; they fall in love and reveal the conspiracy to an astonished world, which rewards him with the life he's always wanted. The guy is always incredibly good-looking, and the woman could pass for Pamela Anderson Lee's twin sister. And both happen to have the exact skills and knowledge required to foil the conspiracy.
Maybe the reason I liked ""The Bourne Identity"" so much is because I hadn't read any of Ludlum's books in several years, and I'd forgotten how he writes his stories. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that I did like it. Despite the formulaic writing, the story's sequencing is seamless - you don't turn a page and suddenly come on a plot twist straight out of left field. Ludlum also doesn't bother with the hokey secret agent mumbo-jumbo you see in some other spy/action novels.
But he doesn't do a good job at all of getting his main characters to talk about their feelings for each other. When it comes to love talk, Ludlum's writing isn't any better than what you'll find in your average Harlequin romance.
With all that, though, I'm glad I picked up this book. I even went out and bought the next book in the ""Bourne"" sequence - but I think I'll wait a few years to read it.",1026086400,,1916,4.477142857142857

I can't beleive that Ludlum would be involved in the production of this movie, to have his name in the credits. What a farcical attempt at making a spy movie. Even ""James Bond"" movies have been better, all of them!",1026086400,,305,4.464285714285714
2331897,3,B0009WK5CW,"I saw this film over the 4th of July weekend. My buddy wanted to see it and I had mixed feelings about seeing it.
After we left, I was wondering ""What happened to my $[money]?""
Let's clear one thing up, Matt Damon is no action hero. The only people on that list should be: Harrison Ford, Will Smith, Sigourney Weaver and Bruce Willis, et al. Second of all, this was not as action packed as I expected it to be. My buddy was really hyped up about the film; before, during and after. I was slightly dumbfounded.
The car chase scene was good, not great. I do not know why they, the media, hyped it up. I have seen better car chases in Mad Max movies. The ""girl"" was annoying. Her overly laid back attitude was not becoming of an action film. She tended to slow things down. But I guess you need a female to spice up this ""action packed"" film.
The movie starts out in the Meditteranean Sea. Our hapless hero, Matt Damon, is resuced by a fishing boat. He is alive despite the bullets in his back. He finally wakes up and does not know who or what he is. Then when they dock, he is homeless. He finds himself sleeping on a bench, the suspense is building, and then attacks two police officers just because they ask him for papers. Then he finds himself being chased by the authorities. He goes to the American Embassay and sees a woman being harrassed by the people behind the partition (just like at the DMV). He eventually hires her to drive him to Paris for $20,000. Reluctantly, why?, she takes the money. He goes to a bank, not knowing why he has to, and discovers his identity, or identities. He starts to question who and what he is while being attacked and hunted by other CIA operatives.
But the highlight of the whole boring ordeal is that car chase scene. I waited for the action to take place, but it never did. The only action scene worth mentioning was the fight scene between Matt and somebody attacking him in his Paris apartment.
Then there was the scene out in the snow, on the property of the friend of the girl. That is where Matt seems to have a revelation about what he is.
Near the close of the film, there is another assassin getting reading to take out his target. What I was confused about is that the target is the guy who has been sending out men to kill Jason Bourne. I still was not too sure as to why he was killed. In the spy business, it is ""kill or be killed."" He was doing his job by dispatching men to kill Jason. But I guess since he failed the entire mission, killing a French speaking African (I think-but then again it was never too clear), then his death is justified. He became the target. Then the movie ends. Of course not without Jason finally getting the girl.
Overall, this movie was a disappointment. Definately not worth the price of a adult ticket. I would not see this movie again. James Bond films are a lot more fun and have significantly more action than this ""spy-thriller"".
I recommend you wait for the DVD or video.",1026086400,,2966,4.317204301075269

He has crafted a nifty spy/action thriller with a stong central performance by Matt Damon, ably supported by Franka Potente (Run Lola Run).
Liman has kept the essential intriguing element of Ludlum's book, which is the amnesia of the hero and his slow realization of his lethal skills.  Damon is great in the action scenes, going on auto-pilot has he opens a can of ""whup-ay"" on anyone that messes with him.  There are great chases and all the stuff we want from this type of film.  Franka Potente is beautiful without being unbelievably so.  She brings the needed reality element to the film and her relationship with Damon.
Little time is wasted, the updating of the technology and the necessary elimination of the Carlos theme all works fine.  This isn't deep intellectualism here, but good craft.  Ludlum's books were pretty cornball and ill-informed but could catch you up despite their flaws.

And can the very same person be a cold-blooded murderer in one incarnation, then become a virtual humanitarian when all memory of that previous life somehow gets wiped away? These provocative questions are raised, though never adequately explored, in `The Bourne Identity,' a fairly standard man-on-the-run spy thriller based on the best selling novel by Robert Ludlum. Written by Tony Gilroy and directed by Doug Liman, `The Bourne Identity' tells the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA hit man who has been suffering from amnesia ever since his bullet-riddled body was plucked floating out of the Mediterranean Sea. Initially unaware of his secret agent status, Jason - together with Marie, a young woman he picks up in Switzerland and hires to drive him to Paris - tries to piece together the clues to his identity and purpose. Essentially we are back in old Hitchcock territory, where the story's hero is being chased by all sorts of nefarious figures even though he himself has not a clue as to who these people are or why it is they are so anxious to put an end to him.
`The Bourne Identity' might have been a more interesting film had it attempted to explore some of the more subtle implications of its morality play situation. Instead, the filmmakers concentrate almost exclusively on the superficial aspects of its spy thriller premise. There are brief flashes where Jason ponders the deeper issues of a troubled conscience, but they are quickly thrown over for the usual cat-and-mouse accoutrements of this odd-man-out scenario. And, frankly, despite the novelty of the Paris setting and some impressive stunt and action scenes scattered along the way, nothing in the film really much engages the audience's sympathy or interest. Matt Damon does a solid job conveying the underlying sweetness of Bourne's character, but nothing in his demeanor or behavior can convince us that he is a government-generated killing machine. What's missing from this story is any attempt to show how this character, whom we have come to view as compassionate and loving, could ever have done the things he is said to have done. That analysis would have lent the film that extra bit of depth it so sorely lacks in its current form.
The film is at its most interesting when it shows how Bourne, because he is himself a product of CIA training, can use the very tools his mentors gave him to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and even outwit the professionals at their own game.
The film features a relatively impressive car chase through the streets of Paris (though it pales in comparison to the ones in `Ronin'). But I can't believe that filmmakers are STILL using that old standby - the one where some workers just happen to be transporting a piece of glass across the street just so the careening cars can come crashing through it. I thought that one had been put to rest, finally and irrevocably, 30 years ago in `What's Up, Doc?'",1025395200,,3002,4.806576402321083

2331923,3,B0009WK5CW,"My best friend recommended The Bourne Identity to me fifteen years ago.  I should have read it then.  My French would have been fresher.  When I purchased this book, I did not realize that both French and German languages accompanied the English.  While the passages in foreign languages are very short, usually no more than one sentence, it is sometimes not clear from the context what is being said.  One passage, perhaps the longest in French, comes at an essential point in the story.  I did not follow the French - my high school French class was fifteen years ago.  About 50 pages later, the passage is explained.  While one need not be fluent in French and German to enjoy this novel, some familiarity with French would be helpful.  The amount written in German is much less.  In all, the story can probably be enjoyed by someone with no knowledge of French or German.
The other reviews tell you plenty about the plot.  Suffice it to say Ludlum is a master storyteller.  Story-weaver would be more fitting.  This book has more twists and turns than a bowl full of spaghetti.  If I were a faster reader, I would not have been able to put it down.  This book is now the standard by which I judge the ability of other writers.  I would dare say that Trevanian, Clancy, and Deighton, do not write as engagingly as Ludlum.  He consistently hooked me at the beginning and ending of every chapter.  I was compelled to read further, to find out who Jason Bourne really was, why he knew the things he knew and did not know the things he did not know.  Where there some slow points?  Yes, but well written.  Does Ludlum repeat some things during the story?  Yes, but only in Bourne's attempt to unravel the mystery for himself.  Some reviewers felt it was over done.  I felt it added to the intensity, the urgency, of Bourne's dilemma.
I will also add that his is one of the few novels that I have read that evoked a good number of emotional responses from me.  Particularly in the first section of the book, I was quite put off by Bourne and the things he would do to stay alive.  He was ruthlessly cruel, but develops into a character who is not bloodthirsty, rather selective in directing his undivided attention at people.
Two other comments...
...I thought the profanity used in this book was a bit much.  It is no Pulp Fiction, but the cursing was pretty heavy.  Were it not for the profanity, I would give this book five stars, three instead.
...On a technical note, unless I'm greatly mistaken, you cannot use a silencer on a revolver as Ludlum tells us several characters do.
In the end, I have a feeling that anyone who likes adventure, mystery, and spy-craft genre novels will enjoy this book.  I wonder now why I waited 15 years to read it.  Oh, because they finally made a movie out of it (which I am certain cannot hold a candle to the book - movies never can).",1025222400,,2872,4.456813819577735
2331924,4,B0009WK5CW,"The purpose of the spy-thriller genre is for us to take vicarious pleasure in the exploits of a super-competent human being facing seemingly insurmountable odds.  The Bourne Identity strongly delivers.  Matt Damon is able to convince us that he's a human killing-machine who is suddenly laboring with a conscience and the small problem of not remembering who he is.  The fight scenes are great; the problem-solving skills are pretty good; and the car chase scene is quite memorable.  It would be impossible to condense all the detail of Bourne's novel into a two-hour flick, but the film does a good job of capturing its spirit.
The film makes good use of its European setting, taking us from Italy to Switzerland and finally to France.  It was great seeing Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) make the leap to American cinema.  She doesn't get to shine to her full potential -- but she's an exciting new face, and her presence adds to the international dimension of the film.  (As an aside, if you are looking for an action film that isn't just another action film, ""Run, Lola Run"" is a lot of fun.)
What the film doesn't do is push against the boundaries of its genre.  It's a well-executed spy-thriller.  But it's nothing more than a spy-thriller.  A great way to while away a few hours -- but you won't be thinking about it much the next day.",1025222400,,1340,4.639830508474576

It was also a theme that has been explored before (with Jackie Chan's 'Who Am I') with some success.  With all that aside it was still an enjoyable movie.  A movie about assassins and the CIA.

2331943,4,B0009WK5CW,"When he's first fished out of the ocean, the man who becomes known as Jason Bourne doesn't know who he is.  The fishing ship's surgeon removes two bullets from his back and a computer-coded device with a Swiss banking account number from his hip.  As he recovers, Bourne finds out that he has incredible abilities but no idea how he got them.  In Zurich, he finds a safe-deposit box with several passports all bearing his picture but in different names.  There's also a small fortune in cash from bills issued in a dozen different countries and a pistol.  Within minutes of his arrival in the bank, an espionage team is hot on his heels.  Bourne is a man on the run, trying to escape an unknown enemy that wants him dead.  All he wants is to know who he is, but when that knowledge points in the direction of him being an assassin, all he wants is out.  Unfortunately, the hounds are upon him.  To live or die, he has to kill or be killed.
Matt Damon (GOOD WILL HUNTING, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY) plays Jason Bourne with surprising ease.  He offers a laid-back performance that is deceptively intense and exactly what is needed by the fast-paced plot.  Franka Potente (BLOW) stars as Marie Kreutz who ends up falling in love with Bourne.  Brian Cox (MURDER BY NUMBERS, THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, THE GLIMMER MAN) turns in a quiet but creepy performance as a CIA director putting the pressure on Bourne's handler to find Bourne and put him down.
Although not as tech-oriented as a James Bond film, THE BOURNE IDENTITY moves through the action paces at a brisk trot and finishes, as it should, with an all-out sprint.  Still, the move and counter-move between hunted and hunters is great and will keep the audience on the edge of his or her seat.  The European settings are beautiful, and the camerawork and use of color absolutely make those scenes stand out even more.  Franka Potente should do more American filmwork because she came across as sexy, intelligent, and vulnerable.  Although there are many layers to this plot, the writing and presentation were excellent, allowing the audience to catch up to speed at a moment's notice even when the newest plot twist changed the whole movie around at times.
Since this is the first movie of a projected trilogy featuring the title character, there were some plot holes left open.  Viewers will want to know why CIA handler Ted Conklin referred to Jason Bourne as a $30 million weapon, and find out exactly what behaviorial software Bourne has been exposed to.  However, based on the premiere movie, most viewers will be content to return to the second installment of the trilogy and wait.  One thing that appeared to be missing from the typical spy fare was the gadgetry and computer applications.  But Robert Ludlum wrote THE BOURNE IDENTITY over twenty years ago, and computers weren't prominent at the time.
Audiences that love James Bond films or movies that offer a hint of mystery with a full serving of action, intrigue, and danger will enjoy THE BOURNE IDENTITY.",1024876800,,3033,4.708333333333333
2331944,3,B0009WK5CW,"Good acting, good action, excellent pacing, hokey story.  Matt Damon is found by a fishing vessel floating in the Mediterranean.  Unfortunately he doesn't remember his name.  He has 2 bullets in his back which are remarkably only skin deep.  What was he shot with, an air rifle?
He meets a gal.  Besides his name he seems to have forgotten all professional discipline as he spills his guts over what he's discovered so far, all of it indicating he is or was some sort of secret agent on a dangerous mission.  It seems to bother his conscience, an interesting after effect of his accident.
Among some papers that a bad guy leaves behind they discover one which conveniently explains the whole plot up to that point (a deus ex machina) which I won't spoil for you.  The rest of the movie involves the CIA, assorted hit men who come after him, at least one really wild gun battle and a big smooch scene.  They get in one bodacious car chase, one which almost ranks up there with Bullet although different in style.
The CIA are operating from a safe house in France.  Safe houses are supposed to be secret; the neighbors apparently haven't noticed that this one is bristling with more antennas than an Aegis class cruiser.  From this location they can look underneath any table on the planet, listen to any phone conversation (and it's the one they want!), etc. etc..  This goes way beyond anything I can imagine being possible.

2331945,5,B0009WK5CW,"First things first...
A lot of learned people I speak to tend to ""diss"" Ludlum as ""pop"" writing or bad litterature.  The fact is, I've read a lot of the classics and tomes that are frequently regarded as priceless material, (Tolstoy, Dickens, Shakespear, etc. etc.) and I cannot think of any that even touch this book, [...] this trilogy, in suspense and drama.  They grasp your attention from the start, and never let go.  All aspects of life, both human and material, are examined, and dealt with with both grace AND shock - all through the eyes of an amnesiac spy and a woman who believes in him.  The complexities and shear brilliance of plot are second to none. (the Supremacy and Ultimatum books are just as good, in my opinion)
 Ludlum in this trilogy is at his very best.  In many of his other volumes, a distinct pattern is obvious in his structures; nazis, old nazis or new nazis are the bad guys, while a male spy and his girl are out to save the world, etc.  Don't get me wrong, I've read most of his other books and found them all good, but they ARE formulaic. They are comperable to Rossini Operas (overtures in particular); Good overall = all the same, yet all different =  all at the same time.
In this trilogy however, his imagination, knowledge of covert ops and the DEPTH of his psychological character profiles are un-matched, and perhaps even un-matchable.
All three books are a must read.  They are fine independently from one another, but really should be read in order for the full effect.
By the way, the new movie is ok, but it's nowhere near the book; as usual, read the book first, and complain about the movie after.  Whats with the removal of the French-Canadian anyways?!!  Shame!  I can hardly believe Ludlum was part of the production at all.

2331947,2,B0009WK5CW,"What can I say?  The only resemblence to Robert Ludlum's story is in title, character name and basic ailment...amnesia.  Except for certain European landmarks, the rest of the story has been made from scratch.  And quite poorly at that.  I found little redeeming value in this version.  What is sad is that this is the first of three Bourne titles and with such a flimsy foundation, the rest of the stories will be as empty as this one.  Perhaps I am being a little too rough on the movie considering the vast majority of theater goers have never read the Ludlum book nor seen the vastly superior miniseries of the same title starring Richard Chamberlain and Jacqueline Smith.  For those that are going to see the movie anyway, whether because they want to see the exciting Paris chase scene (which is decent but hardly French Connection quality) or Matt Damon's acting (which is very bland and holds none of the danger of Chamberlain's performance, which it really should have), treat yourself to the miniseries or the book and then compare the vast differences between the two.  Instead of being an intense jigsaw puzzle of intrigue like the book, the 2002 remake is merely a chase movie.  No complexities whatsoever.  A real disappointment.
AND
Do not see this movie AFTER seeing The Minority Report.  Speilberg's direction is so dead-on that it makes the remake look like... work.  No suspense.  Just by-the-numbers scenes.
I would give this movie 1 star on what they did to the novel.  However, the quality of the acting and directing is workman-like -- not bad, but not exceptional.
I saw the movie last night.  I have just finished watching the miniseries a half hour ago and all I could say is that I really needed that.
BUY THE MINISERIES!  It is available right here...  If you like the remake, you will LOVE the miniseries.
An analogy before I sign off.  One argument can be made that JAWS deviated from the novel big time and still succeeded to be an excellent film.  However in JAWS, the new characters had distinct personalities and motives which made you want to watch them, forgetting how Benchly painted them.

Robert Ludlum's ingenious original story--he made Jason Bourne COMPLETELY alone, hunted by the police and his own colleagues alike, without even memory to help him--is given swift, streamlined treatment by director Doug Liman, with plenty of explosions, assassinations, car chases and double-crosses to keep us on the edge of our seats. Matt Damon gives an assured, charismatic performance as Bourne, his weathered baby face giving the character a certain poignancy without detracting in the slightest from his credibility. He's nobody's male ingenue anymore! German actress Franka Potente lives up to her last name: she's a potent and sexy screen presence, not particularly pretty but far more alluring than many women who are. And it's interesting to see Chris Cooper, normally typecast as a nice guy, give such a thoroughly creepy performance as Bourne's treacherous CIA boss.

Be forewarned that there is a fair amount of physical and weapons violence and some of it is close-up. Much of the fighting is tightly shot and intercut, which likely made the fight training for Damon a bit easier. He is believable, IMO, in the action sequences.
I really liked Franka Potente as Damon's unwitting partner and erstwhile love interest. There was a moment of chemistry between them early in the film which was not built on and, later, the interaction between them, romantically, seemed cliche'.....nothing against their acting skill; I just thought the timing was wrong. I am going to pick up Franka's recent film ""Run Lola Run"" to see more of this earthy German actress.
My only disappointment was in the character development of the goverment agents charged with eliminating Bourne as a threat...IMO, they came off as automatons, characters which I could develop no like or dislike for. One programmed agent, who Bourne was forced to kill when in the French countryside, showed the most humanity and gave me the most insight into the minds of these covert operatives.

Unfortunately, the writer and director decided that the original tightly written, intense and moving story would be better as a disjointed, confusing action movie.
I liked Matt Damon in this movie, I thought he made an excellent Jason Bourne, despite the writing.
I think that the cameramen and the director need to learn what a camera dolly is, and then learn how to use it. The movement of the camera, in addition to the movement of the characters, was unnecessary and unsettling. In order to watch the movie, I had to keep closing my eyes when the camera moved a lot.

I know, I know - not another ""oh the book is SO much better"" review. But even on its own merits, the film is just ... bad.
Despite the 2-hour length, this movie doesn't go into nearly enough depth with the plot to make it truly interesting; my boyfriend, who has not read the book, said that it was ""OK,"" but that he felt the plot just skimmed along the surface. The dialogue is uninspired, and the acting only luke-warm. The Head Office scenes are almost laughable...as much as I love Chris Cooper, I really didn't care for him in this role at all.
I won't go off on a rant about the atrocious direction...suffice it to say that if you see this film, you'll become intimately familiar with every single pore on every single character's face.

This movie is exciting and action packed.  Like most big budget action films it is definitely entertaining.  It is especially fun being set in Europe it gives the viewer the feeling of being swept away to another time and place.  I have yet to locate my copy of the book and it has been so many years since I have read it that I can not comment on the accuracy of the book-to-movie translation.  My feeling, however, is that a bit of the energy that made the book a real page turner was lost in it's movie format.  Matt Damon lacks some of the larger-than-life, hero energy but does come across as a 'really nice guy'.  There is little to no chemistry between Damon and his co-star and the viewer never really feels the desperation and loss such a situation might bring.  While the timing of the movie in general seems a bit off, the action scenes are good and frequent so the overall film is very absorbing.  As with most action films there are inconstancies and they seemed to have forgotten about the whole EU thing but the problems with the movie did not detract from it's entertainment value.",1024444800,,1143,4.48792270531401

2331981,3,B0009WK5CW,"There was a point about half way through ""The Bourne Identity"" when I realized that the movie had no real plot --- but I was enjoying it anyway. Sometimes all you need is a good, solid lead, some nice action, and a well-kept pace in order to be entertained. Thankfully, the movie provides all of those attributes.
""The Bourne Identity"" is about Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), who is found floating in offshore waters by some fisherman, taken aboard their boat, and then recovers from two weeks at sea and two gunshot wounds. The recovery is quick, and Bourne is soon back on land, attempting to find out who he is, all the while people are trying to kill him. And he manages to hitch himself with a European drifter girl named Marie (played by Franka Potente, of ""Run Lola Run"" fame).
Unfortunately for us, and the reason why I say that the movie has no real ""plot"", is that any possibility of mystery and intrigue is zapped out of the story by a few factors. 1: From the title alone, and then a passport seen relatively early on, *we* know Bourne's identity well before he does. 2: We also are clued-in to who is trying to kill him, long before he starts to get an idea, as the action cuts back and forth to his adversaries quite often. And 3: as we know who he is, what his job used to be, who his adversaries are, and what *they* are doing to try to catch him, the potential plot of ""mystery"" is completely removed. All we are left with is the possibility of suspense during some of the action scenes.
Ah, but do those fulfill the purpose admirably. Even though we either already know what's going, or can pretty easily guess, once the story leads us into one of its many action scenes, all bets are off. The suspense comes into focus. The tension arises. And the fighting (Matt Damon must have taken some professional lessons) is great to watch, if a tad bloody. There is one scene in particular in which Bourne outwits an assassin, and it simply teems with nervous excitement as to how he'll resolve the conflict.
""The Bourne Identity"" may suffer from an overexposure of its more mysterious elements, but it stands up well under the wonderful talents of Matt Damon and Franka Potente. They have good chemistry, and the director is smart to keep a primary focus on them. The story moves along at a strong pace, and feels sure of itself.

2331984,4,B0009WK5CW,"Doug Liman's ""The Bourne Identity"" is a snazzy, jazzily directed, edited and scored film about a rogue intelligence agent (not specifically identified but probably C.I.A) who is found floating in the sea, near death at the films beginning.
Bourne (Matt Damon) has a capsule inserted in his brain and 2 bullets in his back and has no idea who or what he is.  It is Liman's job to trace Bourne's steps backwards as well as forwards in time as Bourne tries to answer the question, ""Who Am I?""
Matt Damon is the real revelation here as he has finally come into his own as an actor with this complex, multi-layered and conflicted portrayal of Bourne who is as physically as well as mentally acute: he is more acting than acted upon.  Damon is no longer the street punk of ""Good Will Hunting"" but an adult with adult emotions and motivations.  Franka Potente, so good in ""Blow"" as well as ""Run Lola Run"" plays the ""girl"" Bourne finds along the way and she also makes a forceful impression here.
""The Bourne Identity"" is Doug Liman's step into the big time after his successes in independent films like ""Go,"" and he does a terrific job of holding this huge enterprise together with style and relevance.",1024272000,,1195,4.60093896713615
2331985,5,B0009WK5CW,"Director Doug Liman deserves an academy award nomination for The Bourne Identity.  Alas, it will probably not happen because this stupendous film is not perceived as ""serious"" by the Hollywood snob elite.  Liman is a master of creating breath taking camera shots.  His talent is similar in this regard to the late Stanley
Kubrick.  The choreographed fighting scenes and highlights of Europe compel your rapt attention.  You will not be tempted to move your eyes away from the screen even for a split second. I have no idea if the film version is loyal to Robert Ludlum's novel, but this current interpretation is mind boggling effective and beautifully written.  The only thing required of the viewer is to suspend one's logical faculties.  This is not an intellectual Ipcress File or The Spy who Came in From the Cold.  Think James Bond with a dash of Our Man Flint, and allow yourself to be swept away by super spy and assassin, Jason Bourne.
Matt Damon surprisingly succeeds as Bourne in this non stop escapist spy thriller.  He easily steps into the role of a CIA controlled agent who has lost his memory.  Why does he have couple of bullet holes in his back?  The lethal talents remain, but is he a good or evil man?  People are trying to either capture or murder him.  One thing leads to another, and our protagonist finds out that he might be a Jason Bourne who resides in Paris.  He also runs into Marie (Franka Potente) who helps Bourne escape from one especially threatening predicament.  And yes, there is the required chemistry exuded by the two lovers during their adventures together.  We learn that a CIA boss (Chris Cooper) relentlessly pursues Bourne to save his own skin.  Bourne failed to successfully carry out a mission and almost certainly will prove to be an embarrassment, if not even a career destroyer of his bosses.  There is never a dull moment in The Bourne Identify.  The remaining cast selection is near perfect.  Damon's youth virtually guarantees that he will be in many more action films.  Another actor who will compete with Damon for these sort of movie scripts is British actor Clive Owen.  Thus, it is only appropriate that Owen shares a few scenes as Bourne's cohort who is now assigned to eliminate him.  Lastly, I predict that a sequel will be made of The Bourne Identity.  This property will be too hot not to do so.",1024272000,,2358,4.695121951219512
2331986,5,B0009WK5CW,"I usually do not purchase books of this genre (i.e. action/suspense), but I decided to buy this one because the commercials for the movie looked great. I had no idea when I opened the cover to this book that it would be one that I could not put down or stop reading. I am thoroughly impressed with Ludlum's ability to pack so much action into literally every page of this book. It may seem intimidating, being a 500+ page book, but I was able to finish it in a week and a half. The story is constantly twisting and turning, and you are left wondering what will happen next at the end of each chapter.
All in all, I would highly recommend this book to ANYONE even remotely interested in this genre of books, or even in the film. Robert Ludlum truly proves himself to be a talented author above many others.",1024272000,,805,4.302631578947368
2331987,3,B0009WK5CW,"Action was great.  Bad guys were funny.  Like zombies from a bad chinese ghost film.  They rise up after being knocked down with their whole body straight. (imagine the lines as being the body: ""_"" (fallen) -> ""/"" (rising) -> ""|"" (up))  I found it humorous that they had Clive Owen play another assassin with his vehicle of choice being, naturally, a BMW.  I didn't expect Julia Stiles to play such a minor role as the Paris liaison.  I found that the screenplay varies from the book in almost all the aspects, from beginning to end.
In the novel:
* There is a rivalry between Bourne and Carlos (another master assassin, aka the Jackal).
* The novel is set up to segue into the sequel with the introduction of Mo Povic (a shrink, and eventually family friend).
* Marie is raped in the novel and rescued by Bourne, thus engendering and solidifying their relationship.  (Much more exciting in the novel, Bourne actually kidnaps Marie.  She finally gets a chance to escape and turns him over to bad people.  But she gets into trouble and Bourne rescues her.  Romantic, huh?)
* Bourne takes months to recover after being fished out of the ocean.
* Marie's a really smart American financial analyst.
In the movie:
* Marie plays a nomadic hippie, if you will.  She's out of cash, doesn't have a place to go.  She's got nothing to do.  There's absolutely no reason for her to stay with Bourne if not for his red bag full of cash.  Yet she does.
* Bourne doesn't repay the ship crewman (it wasn't even explained in the film that he's supposed to be a doctor who nurses him back to health and helps him try to recover his memory).
* Bourne recovers from his injuries in about 2 weeks.
* Marie is clearly German (swears in German too).
The movies strong points are the action scenes where we see Damon's training put to good use.  In an interview with Jay Leno, Damon explains how he trained for months on a vicious Filipino martial arts style.  It looks great and brutal on screen.  As for his acting, his sudden fits of anger seem affected (to the point of being soapish - e.g. he says something in anger and tosses his head to one side for effect).  The writers also try to inject humor into Damon's character but it doesn't always work.  It comes off as incongruous to someone who has lost all memory of himself.  I love Franka Potente in Run, Lola, Run (one of my favorite films).  In this film, however, she's lackluster and her presence isn't important.  She clearly trusts Bourne from the beginning (though she's not supposed to).
I guess I had the expectation that this film would be super-""cool"".  It wasn't, but was nonetheless enjoyable as an action film.  I would recommend reading the book if anything I said above interests you.

2332005,3,B0009WK5CW,"Those kids from Good Will Hunting are really growing up.  Now that they have grown up they want to go from the cerebral to the action oriented in one bound.  Right now you could go to the theater and find  Ben Affleck playing a C.I.A. Analyst in The Sum of All Fears or you could check out the adaptation of Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon as the lead.  I can't speak for the latter but you might want to wait and rent this one.
 Matt Damon plays the title role of Jason Borne.  Borne has a lot of special talents unfortunately he has to learn about them one at a time because, well, he has lost his memory.  It seems that he was pulled out of the ocean with two bullets in him as well as a nice little micro-chip.  The men on this ship thought he was dead but much to their surprise he is still alive and after some quick surgery, healing rather rapidly.  He doesn't know who he is or how he came to be in the ocean.  He does know that he seems to speak multiple languages fluently and that this chip is leading him to an address of a bank in Zurich.
 After getting to this bank, the man discovers that he appears to have multiple identities of which Jason Borne seems the most comfortable.  He also has quite a bit of cash, some weapons, and after being attacked...a good deal of fighting skills he was unaware of possessing.  Borne is forced on the run to discover his identity.  Unfortunately the longer he is on the run, the more people with similar skills pop up trying to kill him.  It seems that a major governmental agency is not happy having supposedly dead agents reappear without contacting them.
 First off  I must admit that I have never read the original book so I cannot comment as to how accurate an adaptation this movie is.  That being said, I will state this is a very uneven movie.  The action sequences are first rate and engrossing.  The speed of them can keep you riveted on the edge of your seat.  That's the good news.
 The bad news is that the rest of the movie moves as a snails pace and doesn't sustain the suspense in the slightest.  If anything the middle sequences slow the movie considerably.  Also, the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere.  The beginning makes some sense for story purposes but the end just happens with no particular climactic moment.  One minute the movie is going along and the next...it just stops dead in its tracks.  It almost leaves you wanting more with the earnest hope that something else will happen to explain the movie.
 Matt Damon does do a good job in the title role.  He is very believable as someone who has lost all touch with himself and suddenly finds people all converging with his face in their scope.  He is pretty phenomenal in the action sequences and they were quite surprising in their ferocity.  This movie is full of action but make no mistake, it is definitely PG-13 oriented as most of it is bloodless.
 Most of the rest of the actors have meaningless characters and could have been done by anyone.  Character actor Chris Cooper, Lone Star and The Patriot, is wasted as the ""villain"" and Julia Stiles, Save the Last Dance, is almost non-existent in her role.
 Did I hate the movie?  Not particularly but I was not totally entertained.  It had some great moments but they were few and far between.",1024272000,,3296,4.3990066225165565
2332006,3,B0009WK5CW,"It can be quite disappointing when an actor with screenwriter's talent gets himself tangled up in a genre picture.  Even more disappointing is when said genre picture proclaims itself to be a suspense thriller but turns out to be little more than a punch-and-kick actioner.  With ""The Bourne Identity"", little Matty Damon grows up, and it turns out that he has a little Steven Seagal in him.
That's not to say that ""The Bourne Identity"" is nothing more than schlocky summer fare.  It can be, at times, quite engaging and provoking.  It's premise -- CIA-trained super-assassin on the run from his former bosses, hampered by severe amnesia -- has a lot of potential for questioning the archetypal hero's persona, and tackling issues of identity.  It further proves the notion, also espoused by ""Fargo"" and ""Insomnia"", that the limited palette of beautiful snowy locales (Switzerland and France here) can be an intense and impressive backdrop for a thriller.  And it has a stab at the one storytelling device that I'm a sucker for every time: the unreliable narrator.
Damon, plays Jason Bourne, a character that is cold and calculating, but ever ready to spin himself out of his shell and knock the baddies around.  Some of the movie's best psychological moments actually come in these action scenes.  Bourne doesn't know a thing about his previous life, and seeing him realize that he's a lethal fighting machine, right at the moment when he needs it most, is quite thrilling.  Damon does a fine job in these scenes, pulling off both the tormented hero and athletic wunderkind portions of his character.  However, I would have liked to see him inject some more humour into the role.  The opportunities were surely there.  He plays paranoid and coiled the whole time, and after awhile it got grating.
One of the film's fatal flaws is that casts, and then wastes, a heap of wonderful actors.  Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles, all actors who've proven time and again that they can deliver interesting and complex performances, are asked to play mere plot devices here.  Cooper is the go-for-broke assassin team leader.  Cox is the worrisome bureaucrat.  Stiles is the prodigious tech-op.  None plays anything resembling a full-fledged character, although all are game in their attempts to flesh one out.  Most disturbing is the work turned in by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje.  He was always terrifying on HBO's ""Oz"" (as gang leader Adebisi).  But here he is terribly over the top and ludicrous as a recently deposed African dictator.  So much so that the friend with whom I saw the film leaned over to me, after Adewale's first appearance, and asked if we'd accidentally paid to see ""Coming to America 2"".
The one supporting actor who fulfills his/her role nicely is the thinking man's uber-babe, Franka Potente.  The star of ""Run Lola Run"" plays Marie, who in the hands of a lesser actress would have been little more than a cipher of a love interest.  But Potente injects her with tenderness and vulnerability, while also being sexier than I've ever seen her.  She and Damon have a few truncated love scenes, and what they share together is always sensual, without ever being blatant.
Director Doug Liman, whose work I admired in ""Swingers"" and found problematic in ""Go"", two movies more concerened with clever dialogue than swift fists, would seem an unlikely fit for a spy thriller.  But he does his best to lay back and let the story take shape.  The opening scene is played almost perfectly, giving the audience as little information as possible, but still allowing them to figure out that the floating body found by fisherman just off Marseilles has an even more terrible story to tell than first expected.  His camera work, for the most part, manages to capture the stunning and stark beauty of his locales.  Unfortunately Liman also, at times, feels the need to play with his new big-budget toys.  So we get a lot of flashy digital information flittering its way across the computer screen.  There's nothing more effective at taking the audience out of a visceral action sequence.  And during the lesser of those action sequences, Liman shows that he too has a bit of Steven Seagal in him (one such sequence has a quick succession of limbs bending in directions they weren't designed to go).  Alas, his editing and choice of close-ups sometimes caused problems: is that Bourne's leg being broken, or the operative sent to kill him?  It got quite confusing at times.
In the end, Bourne degenerates from being a perfect, but still humanly flawed, killing machine, to a capital-A, capital-H Action Hero.  Which is far from Damon or Liman's strengths.  I suspect that their instincts should have provided some room for doubt, but the audience never gets the impression that Bourne is in any real danger.  So a film that is still better than your average cookie-cutter spy picture becomes a minor disappointment for all the potential it wastes.",1024272000,,4949,4.899159663865547

I don't think the script challenged the actors but because the story is told primarily through the eyes of Jason Bourne, a man suffering from amensia, I stayed interesting in the story. I, along with Jason, kept wondering what had happened to him and what would happen to him.
I feel the producers missed an opportunity when they decided not to incorporate Carlos, the world's most dangerous assassin, from the book, into the storyline. He would have, at least, been an interesting character to follow. Otherwise we had just a man and a woman running around Europe having a gratuitous sex scene but mostly trying to stay one jump ahead of those badboys from the CIA.

Jackson called 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' where Davis plays a spy with amnesia, and she eventually teams up with Jackson, with whom she barely knows, and they are on the run from Davis's former employee.

2332028,2,B0009WK5CW,"""The Bourne Identity"" is one of those movies that starts, plays out, and ends all so self-containedly that once you walk out of the theatre, the world of the film evaporates.  Everything is so compact and perfectly contained that it leaves the viewer with no lasting impressions or even a real memory of it.  There are no deep psychological or philosophical issues at work in the script, and none of the action is really impressive enough to warrant discussion later.  Just think of this as Matt Damon's bid to be placed on the ever-increasing list of 'actors starring in forgettable spy flicks' alongside Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Will Smith.  ""The Bourne Identity"" is just more insulting in its mediocrity because of its origins - the book that this movie is ostensibly based on is actually quite interesting.
Sadly, when considered wholly, this movie is so much less than a sum of its parts.  The acting is very good, the script isn't completely dumb (if not exactly brimming with witty dialogue), and the camerawork and the locations are gorgeous.  Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, if looking a bit too much of a callow kid to be a hard-edged CIA assassin, is convincing and engaging as a man who has too many locked secrets in his head and has lost his key.  Franka Potente, most famous for her athletic role in ""Run, Lola, Run"" is a nice change from the stereotypical token love interest in movies such as these.  Not pretty in a conventional sense and trying hard to be the 'feisty partner' that other movies have dictated that she be, but not quite succeeding, Potente actually makes an impact with her anomalous appearance.  The big disappointments come with Julia Stiles and Clive Owen, both billed on the poster, and both receiving little more than cameo appearances.  Stiles spends her four scenes attached to a computer keyboard, and Owen has only about five lines and some moaning to do.  A sad waste of fine actors, even if their bits are well performed.
The real downfall of ""Bourne"" lies in its plot, though.  It's not so much the gross story line, which we've seen over and over again with different actors righting different villainous plots, but the smaller details that just bring a sense of unreality to the proceedings.  A man with two bullet holes in his back lowering himself by his arms down a building?  Julia Stiles as the head of a Parisian safe-house?  Excuse me while I go put logic out of its misery forever.  It's not so much the fact that we are told to check our brains at the door, but that all the proceedings are done with a seriousness that makes one think that a brain might actually be needed.

However, his body remembers. Making his way to Zurich to check out his only clue, he discovers he's a multilingual martial-arts expert. Which means ... what?

Meanwhile, we learn that Bourne is some kind of CIA operative from an off-the-books mission gone awry. His boss (Chris Cooper, the rigid neighbor from ""American Beauty"") now wants him dead. So the chase begins, with Bourne's only help coming from a young German woman named Maria (Franka Potente). She's got a car and a venturesome spirit, but the more they find out about his former self, the less either of them likes it.
The movie has all those welcome spy-movie accoutrements: a train speeding through a snow-covered tunnel, some sinewy cat-and-mouse games in Paris, topped off by an A-plus car chase, even a chilling spy vs. spy confrontation in the French countryside with an agent known as the Professor (""Croupier's"" Clive Owen).
That said, the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots, spy-on-the-run picture. Director Doug Liman, best known for ""Swingers,"" not only treats his story with intelligence, but he makes some refreshingly off-beat choices. For one, he casts lovely Julia Stiles as a Paris go-fer for the CIA. In a more conventional movie, she would've played Potente's role.
Damon isn't a typical hero either. His boyishness brings a different slant to the role. One of the movie's more winning aspects is watching Damon watch himself as he discovers all the things he somehow knows how to do (at times, it suggests Tobey Maguire's wonder when he first tries out his powers in ""Spider-Man""). In one amusing scene at a diner, within five minutes of being seated, Damon tells Potente that the waitress is left-handed; the guy at the counter may be fat but he knows how to handle himself; and the likeliest place to find a gun, if needed, is in the glove compartment of the truck outside. Not only doesn't he know how he knows these things; he can't imagine why he would know them.
Potente, who first turned critics' heads in the German film, ""Run Lola Run,"" is becoming an intriguing presence in American movies. She suggests Lili Taylor with a sexier edge, yet she has a grounded kind of beauty that makes her credible. As a bonus, she brings a European quality to her role that somehow seeps into the rest of Liman's film.
She's not precisely what we expect. Neither is Damon. Neither is ""The Bourne Identity.""",1023840000,,2976,4.803118908382066
2332033,4,B0009WK5CW,"Ludlum's spy thriller incaptivated me. The confusion involved with not knowing the actual identity of Jason Bourne until the end added to the intrigue of the book. There was not a single page where I found myself bored. Ludlum definitely has the talent to compare with the renowned authors such as J.R.R. Tolkein. Reading his novel was like reading a modern day Agatha Christie mystery.
While the movie looks good, I'd reccommend that everyone read the book. Movies are just never the same.",1023840000,,490,4.9156626506024095

This may be the first I've ever read, and it was great. With the movie coming to theaters soon, I thought I'd get a head start on the story. It was great!! One of the rules of good story writing is for the protagonist to know what his go al is, what's driving him to the climax of the story. In this case, the protagonist starts off not only now knowing what he wants, he doesn't know who he is. And we, the readers gradually learn, along with him, not only who he is, but also what he needs to do. This is an artfully crafted novel which you won't want to put down.

2332035,3,B0009WK5CW,"I saw the Bourne Identity last night (6/4/02) at a special advanced screening in San Francisco.  Matt Damon was introduced at the end of the film and took questions from the audience for about a half hour.
I've read Ludlum's book and the movie is very loosely based on it.  Essentially this is about a man found floating in the sea, near death from gunshot wounds.  As the man wakes, he has no memory and eventually he finds himself on the run with the aid of a woman he barely knows.  Unlike the book, there is no Carlos, Marie is a gypsy not a banker, and the movie is set almost entirely in Paris
I thought the movies was less of a spy thriller than a movie about two people on the run.  There were several lighter moments in the film with Damon and Franka Potente on the run.  Potente is really good and very funny.  Chris Cooper (a great character actor) doesn't have the greatest lines, but delivers them quite well.  Julia Stiles is also in this movie, but her role is rather small.  Clive Owen is in the movie as well (not driving a BMW though) and while his role is small, he performs well especially as he talks about his life and sacrifices.
I thought this film was good entertainment, but not great.
Matt Damon said that he studied martial arts and had weapons training for five months.  He did do most of his own stunts.  Some of the fights scenes were great with an almost Matrix-like super-soldier type attitude.  There is a great stunt near the end of the movie as Bourne makes a move to get down the staircase.
The film was shot in Paris and the Czech Republic.",1023235200,,1578,4.329931972789115

It has its moments, but Ludlum can't sustain the intensity.  One chapter may be compelling enough to reel you in, but then it allows your mind to wander in a cascade of lackluster chapters.  Not only is Ludlum a very poor writer, but he's also not a particularly good story teller.  Through the mind of Jason Bourne, he routinely states the obvious and continues to restate the obvious through extremely tedious dialogue.  Although I'm sure it's a great sleep aid for insomniacs, it took all of my will power just to finish The Bouring Identity to the bitter end.",1021420800,,719,4.72

After visiting many of the same locations that were written about in the novel, it was easy to picture the scenes in my mind.  But the real value of the book is the character development of Jason Bourne with the multiple twists and turns of the plot. A real page turner for even me...an avid non-fiction reader.
Bourne finds himself on a beach with amnesia...and must take the clues one by one to find out his true identity...and why assasins are chasing him.

Opinion:
It is difficult to keep a plot based on amnesia from getting too much like bad TV, but Ludlum pulls it off.

Jason Bourne washes up on a beach with no recollection of who is is or how he got there. Nursed back to health by a drunken doctor bits of his past slowly begin to come back to him, and with it the danger of his true identity. An identity that many would kill him for.

Robert Ludlum's "" The Bourne Identity"" is already a classic thriller. This is the first instalment of the Bourne's serie and as many other series, you have to read all the books to really reach the end of the story. I mean, this novel has an ending, but it is very open, and many mysteries remain unsolved so far.
Of course the most developed character here is the man named Jason Bourne. It is interesting to see how he discoveries his potential identity little by little -- and brings up many other questions about himself. And as it should be, he is very afraid to find out who he is, because he may not be a good person. The other important character is Marie St. Jacques who is not as well written as Bourne. Sometimes she lacks in credibility, but it doesn't jeopardize the reading.
Some people may complain this novel is very dated: the actions happen in the mid 70's and geopolitics has an important role through the action. But it seems to me that only by that time such story would happen. Nowadays, the world is so different and tecnology much more developed that would make Bourne think and act in  different ways.
I think the film version of this novel --starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente --that is about to be realesed is quite different from the material source, adding characters, events and maybe updating the story. We have to wait to see it. Anyway, I highly recomend this page-turner  for those who wants to read some action and mystery.",1015891200,,1649,4.530201342281879

I really enjoyed how the author slowly revealed the main character to the audience.  My only complaint is that the other characters seemed to be a little shallow (minus a star for this...)
The story is that a man is brought to a doctor with horrible injuries and no memory of who he is or was.  The doctor only shows him a piece of microfilm surgically implanted into his body with the name ""Jason Bourne"" and a number of a bank account.  This man must figure out who he is while he is being chased by the police and other assassins (who know him, but he doesn't know them...)

Killers are chasing him for reasons he doesn't remember. He falls in love with a woman named Marie who is determined to help him get his memory back. But will Jason Bourne want to find out who he was? What if he was somebody he didn't want to be?

2332049,5,B0009WK5CW,"I promised I'd read The Bourne Identity after having seen the trailer starring Matt Damon in next year's movie by the same name.  When I realized that Robert Ludlum had written the original book in 1980, I went to the library to pick up a copy.  There's a similarity between the leading characters in Robert Ludlum's books.  They're usually male, headstrong (and ultimately always the good guy), determined and they fall for a girl that complements the guy in some way.
A couple of persnickety points I have to mention in my reviews(as always):  I found it irritating the way Marie St. Jacques (the leading lady) speaks to Jason Bourne.  She uses ""Darling"" a lot and her speech seems somewhat formal and affected.  The author also uses italics to indicate what's going on in a character's mind from time to time.  The recurring themes in this book are: be a sponge (because you've got amnesia), move! (because you're being hunted), don't kill if you don't have to (because deep down you're actually a good guy - a govt. guy).  But sometimes, it just feels redundant and tedious to read.  The first Ludlum book I've read is the recent bestseller The Sigma Protocol.  I rated and reviewed that book on Amazon as well.  In my review I ended by saying the author got preachy towards the end to do some last minute plot explanation before ending the book.  I see a slight hint of that in this book as well.
Some good points to consider are: It is my opinion that the author makes improvements to the style and tone of the sequel to this book called The Bourne Supremacy (which I liked better).  I found it more action packed and rythmic.  (The fact that I had spent most of my childhood summers in Hong Kong also helped.)  I also enjoy his usage of local dialect interspersed in the characters' speech to give color and that authentic feel to the characters in his books.  (Turns out he's been using this technique for the past 20+ years.  You still see it in his latest novel The Sigma Protocol.)
If I had to give a more precise rating for this book, I'd rate it a 4.5.  I'm saving the higher ration of 5.0 for The Bourne Supremacy, which I'll write a review for next.  Stay tuned.",1008460800,,2177,4.493638676844784

2332052,5,B0009WK5CW,"In order to enjoy Robert Ludlum's work it is often necessary to suspend one's sense of disbelief, and to a degree silence the critic within.  This book is no exception.  Ludlum's work tends to follow a standard formula.  He typically presents us with a protagonist posessing extaordinary skills who suddenly finds himself alienated from the powers that he serves.  We quickly learn that those in power are either corrupt, or incompetant.  Our hero will soon be betrayed by friends, and helped by former antagonists.  Our hero will eventually fall in love under improbably circumstances, and his new love will prove to be his trump card.  She can go places he can't, and interpet things as an ""outsider looking in"".  Ludlum's books are packed with cliches, but Ludlum created most of those cliches.
Is Ludlum the author of great literature, absolutely not; however, his books provide a door to an alternate reality where one man, with the help of a good woman, can save the world.

2332054,4,B0009WK5CW,"This is not one of those ""take-over-the-world"" type of conspiracy which many thrillers seemed to thrive on, it is simply a tale of an amnesiac man who was struggling to survive against all odds.  The man, with unremarkable appearances, found himself marked for death by unseen enemies.  Using skills he never realized he had, he raced across Europe, leaving a bloody trail of deaths.  Millions of dollars are somehow involved, with different people pursuing him for different reasons.  Along the way, he found assistance from the least expected source ...
The author did well in several things about this book:
The phasings - The book consisted of several phases, with the first phase being the unidentitied person fished out of waters and taken to a small port in southern France. There, he was nursed physically and mentally back to health by an English doctor.  The doctor played the part of the readers, acting out their more common suggestions on how to regain the identity of the amnesiac man without going to the authorities.  Readers who wondered about why the authorities were kept out received a plausible explanation.  However, it is a pity that no more is heard from the doctor for the rest of the book.  He was the more interesting character in this part of the book.
Next, having regained his strength and some measure of confidence, plus a bit of control over his emotions, the mysterious man set off to Zurich.  There, he found a city which had known him, or known of him.  He also found himself recognised and targetted to be killed.  It was in this part of the book more of his skills surfacing, not only in self-defence in physical contact, but also self-preservation.
The pace of the book picked up from Zurich as more names from the man's past emerged : Jason Bourne, Carlos, Treadstone, New York, and Cain ...  Also, somewhere in his memories are remembrance of assassinations.  Bourne, as the man realised he was known as, had to find out what role he had in the killings and the money, before he was killed.  More and more parties emerged who wanted to neutralise him.
As the story travels across Europe, the book entered different phases, each distinct, with the mysterious man changing, evolving or rather, the man who was his past emerging.  Though the book is long, there is no repetition of plots as the man desperate sought for and followed clues after clues to his past. The irony which would have struck the readers was that the action of the man so thoroughly confounded his opponents, though it was the action of a man who couldn't remember, the very actions saved him several times from their traps.
Finally, it was only in the last phase that the identity of the man was revealed to readers, who could not have guessed the twist.  Unfortunately for him, his main opposition had also been busy severing his past so that he had nothing to return to.
Readers were left wondering how the tale would turn out.  It was rather disappointing as readers would feel that loose ends were left unattended, unaccounted.  At least, within this book.
The man created by Ludlum was an excellent piece of work, who would win the readers' sympathies.  Action thrilling paragraphs were also interspersed with contemplations without pointless ramblings, a failing of many thrillers which tried to take themselves too seriously.
Definitely a worthwhile read.",991526400,,3373,4.824652777777778

The book is a tad long, could have been around 300 pages. A few details are splattered, omission of which wouldn't have hurt the story. The progression of the story makes it interesting.

Ludlum put everything in this one and spares no plot twist. It  is flawless and you must read it now! Read it!",963187200,,713,4.115942028985507
2332064,5,B0009WK5CW,"WOW! Even today, this novel is one you will not be able to put down, even though it was written in 1980 during the Cold War era. But this only reflects slightly on the narrative. The story concerns Jason Bourne, who is  shot and thrown overboard in the Mediterranean Sea, only to be washed  ashore and discovered by a Dr Washburn. And this is only the start - he is  suffering amnesia and Washburn finds a microfilm detailing a Swiss bank  account of four million dollars surgically implanted in his hip! Bourne  travels to Zurich and discovers people out to kill him, and so let the  chase begin! Marie St Jacques is an unwilling hostage who develops a bond  with Bourne - she's a Canadian diplomat with a secret. What is the secret  as well of Treadstone Seventy-One, and why are the authorities trying to  use Bourne as a pawn against Carlos Sanchez, famous assassin  extraordinaire? The action does not stop for over five hundred pages, it  grabs you from the start and never lets go until the final pages. Very  typically, there are numerous surprises and unexpected twists - what is  Bourne's connection with clandestine activity during the Vietnam War which  keeps haunting him, stirring up lost memories? The locations, particularly  Paris and its environs and Zurich are well-described and easy to relate to  having been there myself. I remember reading and loving this book at the  age of fifteen, and it will always be an all-time favourite. Recommended!",962323200,,1465,4.796
2332073,5,B0009WK5CW,"This book, which I read when it first came out in 1980, used to be my automatic choice for best thriller/suspense novel ever. Although I have not thought about this for years, it is hard to think any other book of this  type that may have equaled or surpassed this one. It is both a simple and  complex story of a covert action gone wrong, where both the good guys and  the bad guys are, for a long time, lost as to what is going on. It is also  one of the greatest amnesia thrillers ever. The twists, travels, action,  and surprises all follow quickly in a long and satisfyingly fast moving  narrative. This book had such an impact on me that it caused me to  automatically buy every new Ludlum book since in hardcover the moment it  became available. Unfortunately, I have found Ludlum dissapointing after  the very next book, ""The Parsifal Mosaic"". It seems to me that  he, after becoming the top man in his field, became rather indulgent and  conventional in the management of supporting characters and of plot  resolutions. Yet I will still pre-order the new one coming in October!  Incidentally, let me emphasize that ""pre 'The Aquitaine Progression'  Ludlum"" is still unmatcheable in the thriller/suspense novel field.",961718400,,1225,4.716981132075472
2332074,4,B0009WK5CW,"Robert Ludlum tended to drag this book out a little much. It was still readable though. This man has no idea who he is. He finally starts piecing the puzzle together. He kidnaps a woman who winds up being his future wife  and proves to be invaluable in his quest for his identity. His most  shocking discovery comes when he discovers that he is wanted dead or alive  by international killer ""Carlos the Jackal"". After several near  assasinations the book ends leaving room for a sequel. Buy this book but  pay attention or you will get lost.",961545600,,541,4.536082474226804
2332075,5,B0009WK5CW,"This is one of those books that when it is over, you wish it wasn't.  It is great reading, easy to understand, and a wonderful spy thriller.
A man awakens to find out he does not know who he is.  He is treated by an old  drunk doctor who finds him on the beach after he's been shot several times  and left for dead.  Who is this almost dead man?  Nobody knows, not even  the victim himself.
As the story progresses, the man figures out he must  be one Jason Bourne who is a paid assassin.  But is he really?  Or was he  set up?
This is an excellent thriller.  It is exciting, romantic, and  everyone is left feeling sorry for this man who seems to be a really nice  person, but who also thinks he's a killer.
I would recommend The Bourne  Identity to everyone who enjoys spy thrillers.",961286400,,785,4.14
2332076,4,B0009WK5CW,"I picked up THE BOURNE IDENTITY because of speculation of it being made into a film, with top Hollywood names being banded about for the role of Jason Bourne.  The story is summarized well above and in other reviews, so  I'll only give comment.  It was really a great thrill ride.  There is  geniune suspense through out the book, leaving you feeling what Bourne does  as he discovers more and more of what he has forgotten, or thinks he has,  about himself.  This will make a good film.  But, then we get to the  ending, which was built up to extremely well but left me feeling robbed and  cheated.  Not good for any story.  Without any revealtion I'll just say  this book is one of three featuring Bourne.  I haven't read any farther yet  but plan to, with some reluctance though.  The ending just did not support  itself; the level of suspense you feel wants a proper ending right then.  But don't let this stop you from picking up THE BOURNE IDENTITY.  Just  prepare yourself for a little longer journey.",959644800,,1008,4.488888888888889
2332077,5,B0009WK5CW,"Wow, yet again Ludlum has managed to keep me glued to the book, i could not put it down!  This is a fantastic story full of twists and surprises that keep you interested the whole time.  The main character Jason is  incredible but made even more real by the love of his life Marie.  I cant  wait to get hold of the next book in the series.  Dont start this book if  you have other things you need to get done, you will soon forget all about  them!",959558400,,447,4.0
2332078,5,B0009WK5CW,"Ludlum surpasses not only himself but all other spy thriller writers for all times to come. I started in 1977 with Scarlatti Inheritance and have ever since been hooked to Ludlum. But Bourne Identity exploded on me like  no other book or experience I had. It is more than a spy story or about a  person called Bourne trying to fight tremendous odds with a total memory  loss with bursts of  memory flashes of the violent past with layers of  different personalities. It is about human mind itself discovering its way  using the ultimate training of the past to protect it and achieve the  objective imprinted in the psyche. The events will linger forever in the  mind and you will be hungry to read another book which can match this book.  Yes! Read it ,Enjoy it and be haunted by it.",958953600,,784,4.50354609929078
2332079,5,B0009WK5CW,"Robert Ludlum is a master story-teller! His writing is superb! One thing to note, whenever you begin one of his lengthy books you need to devote enough time for 50 pages in the first sitting just to get to know all the characters. It is well worth your time to do so.
This book is probably the BEST spy thiller I have ever read. The main character, Jason Bourne, is a character you learn to really care about. Not all writers are capable fo creating that feeling with their writing. Ludlum is a master. Though this book is part of a three part series, this book DOES stand well on it's own. I have read all three -- I highly recommend this -- and now all three have a cherised spot on my bookshelf. Good enough to read more than once in a lifetime!",957830400,,748,4.201388888888889
2332080,4,B0009WK5CW,"Ludlum is one of the best at creating the super spy and writing action sequences.  Sometimes he can create a spy story to back them up.  This one is pretty good throughout.  He isn't that good with the emotional  development of his characters or writing love stories (but he isn't nearly  as bad as Tom Clancey in these areas).  The hero agonizing over what his  identity might be gets to be tedious and the love story is awkward as in  all of his books.  But, mostly the book moved at a good enough pace to make  me want to read more.
This is the first book in a three part series.  I  didn't know that when I read the book, and was frustrated and disappointed  as I neared the end of the book and realized the story wouldn't be  concluded.  The second book in the series (Bourne Supremacy) is pretty bad  and doesn't really build on the first book.  It isn't necessary to read it  before jumping on to the third book (Bourne Ultimatum) and the conclusion  of the story.  The third book isn't as good as the first, but is worth  reading for the conclusion.",954979200,,1057,4.290816326530612

2332083,5,B0009WK5CW,"I fell in love with Jason Bourne.  Ludlum makes you feel for this man.  He may be an assassin but you want to be the woman who helps him find out his past.  I couldn't stop reading it until I reached the end.

I could probably go on for pages  detailing everything in this book that makes me call it the best Spy novel  ever, but I will just say that from first page to last, I don't think there  is one time you want to put it down.

2332098,5,B0009WK5CW,"Amazed by the huge amont of books written by Robert Ludlum, I decided to buy and read one of his books. With the help osf Amazon, I chose this one, ""The Bourne Identity"", because I liked the synopsis, the customer comments, but mostly because it was part of a trilogy. Trilogies enable the writer to deeply develop their characters and plots, explaining in one book what was left behind in another.  At first I couldn't believe what I was reading. It made me feel bad, and I couldn't reason why. Only  when I was in the 100th page I figured out: I hadn't breathen since the beginning. It's incredible how Ludlum keeps a F-1 pace to his story. When you think that he's gonna stop and let you rest, he increases the rythim again.  ""The Bourne identity"" is the story of a man that could be anyone: me, you, a friend of yours. You simply don't know who Jason Bourne is, because even himself can't remember. That's what's cool about the plot. The reader makes the discoveries together with the main character, dodging bullets, escaping from the unknown enemy, traveling along Switzerland, France and United States. All this with the help of beautiful Marie St. Jacques, a woman that sees herself drowning in another person's nightmare.  Ludlum writes in na universe peopled with evil bank managers, above-government agencies, cold-blooded murderers, just like Forsythe. And in the meantime he still finds time to be funny. Really, there are some true pieces od comedy in the book.  All in all a fantastic read, mostly the first hundred pages. I only hope that the sequel is as good as the first one. I'm gonna buy ""The Bourne Supremacy"", and hope to find that Ludlum could keep his good writing.",900115200,,1690,4.695945945945946

(12-97). It blew my mind to realize that this incredible read was inspired by a real news story.  I just finished reading it for the second time in 15 years and still couldn't put it down!  I enjoy reading Cussler & Clancy but this has it all!  Even a love story!  I found it fascinating to learn how Swiss bank accounts work, how to change your identity, etc.  The suspense was gut wrenching all the way to the last pages.  I strongly encourage other women with a spirit of adventure to read this! Yeah, it's not just for you macho guys!  (Smile...)",884736000,,758,4.410071942446043
2332100,4,B0009WK5CW,"Ludlum's celebrated ""The Bourne Identity"" is really nothing more than a modern day reworking of A.Dumas'""The Count of Monte Cristo""(a ""10"" in any translation)...the story of revenge and repressed identity has a thrilling Mediterranean opening,.. before Ludlum widens the scope of the novel across the face of Europe...the sheer sweep of the book is almost irresistible, and places it at the  forefront of like genre thrillers;as a prose stylist,though, Ludlum is no Ambler or Greene. If you want to sample his work-this is the place to start....but just about any Frederick Forsyth novel of international intrigue will be better written and more accurate technically.",883353600,,667,5.413461538461538
2332101,4,B0009WK5CW,"I only dock it down to an 8 because it can be hard to follow at times.  This is by no means a ""light read"" - this is what you read if you want to spend some free time being the James Bond From Hell, In Hell.  Actually, Bourne is better than Bond - more believable.  Far more.  And more complex.  You will get sucked in, you will have trouble putting this book down, and you will learn how to do some of the shadier things in life - like hide in plain sight.

If you get stuck somewhere in the book, don't worry - just take a deep breath (you've probably been holding your breath, waiting for what happens next), and re-read the paragraph or page that lost you.

 Once you've finished the book, give it some time to sink in, then read it again - you'll find something new you missed last time.",873244800,,792,4.064516129032258
