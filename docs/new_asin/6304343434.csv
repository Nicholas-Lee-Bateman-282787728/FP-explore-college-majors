870885,5,6304343434,This is a wonderful film showing how fragile justice really is and how it was terribly abused in wrongly accusing a German alien of murdering a famous American's child.  It is a must see and it proves how even great Americans like Lindbergh have tragic and disgusting faults.  A great film!,1008288000,,290,4.666666666666667
870886,1,6304343434,"Crime of the Century fails much in the same way the system of justice failed in the prosecution of for the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's baby in the 1930s, not enough evidence.
I know Mark Rydell  (On Golden Pond) to be an extremely sensitive filmmaker and stage director,  his motivation here, I'm sure was to present an alternative to Hauptmann's  guilt, to entertain ideas that the prosecution may have erred. The evidence  was only circumstantial, of the course the crime was horrible, but  Hauptmann's execution may have been more a result of public outrage than  guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
And he may be right, based on everything  I've read, he probably is right. Unfortunately all the probabilities in the  world add up to nothing on screen. After only a couple of suppositions the  viewer gets so lost in the ultimate goal of the story that he loses  interest. I've watched this film 3 times, and lost interest every  time.
What a waste of terrific actors, including Stephen Rea, J.T. Walsh,  Michael Moriarty, Vyto Ruginis, Barry Primus, and Allen Garfield.
Without closure, as long we as know as little as we do about what  actually happened, maybe this story is best left to the true-crime section  of the local bookstore, or Investigative Reports, Dateline, or 20/20. Told  this way, in this medium it's a sad waste of time.",949622400,5,1358,4.843478260869565
870887,5,6304343434,"Everything about this movie is brilliant. The acting, the story and the lessons to learn. This is definitely recommended for children and adults alike who want to learn about what life has to teach us. That man is  consumed by himself; that a virtuous woman is indeed had to find; and that  the truth is ultimately best, even at the risk of your own life.
I know  Hauptmann today only because and thanks to his virtuous wife, he ultimately  stood for what was true and died for it. His one sin was to have covered  the truth in the first place. May God bless his soul, his wife and their  family.
I recommend that this video be shown both at home and at work,  to help reinforce the kind of values that society should have.
I thank  the writer, producers, actors and all others involved in the production of  this film -  for sharing this wonderful story with us and for giving me and  all others the opportunity to learn.",940118400,6,922,4.364705882352941

7870752,4,6304343434,HBO needs to package this up for DVD as it's been too long since this was available for purchase. People are buying bootleg copies made from Laser disc for goodness sakes; that's money lost for HBO. Folks are being forced to buy VHS even -- probably for transfer to DVD or Digital.,1425081600,2,281,4.423076923076923
7870753,5,6304343434,A very accurate and well acted movie.  A piece of history and how investigation is not always good or easy even with a high profile situatuion with famous people,1388707200,,161,4.551724137931035
7870754,3,6304343434,I bought it to compare to the version staring Anthony Hopkins.  This one was more controversial. But both were just TV quality.,1367280000,,127,4.7727272727272725
7870755,5,6304343434,"Talk about a Conspiracy to Convict. This movie has all the trimmings of an American tragedy of justice, one the likes of Sacco and Vanzetti in its day.

I'll start by saying that the movie was A+ Excellent.  The acting was riveting, so much so that I found myself angry with and disgusted by the actors playing the investigative roles.  This movie about the true kidnap and murder of Charles Lindburgh's baby in 1932 puts to shame many crime/courtroom dramas being peddled today as John Grisham-esque.  The crime is horrific and actions of those who arrest and prosecute the suspect are horrendous. To think that the lead investigator on the case was the father of U.S. Army General Stormin Norman Schwarzdopf of Operation Desert Storm fame makes this historical movie that much more interesting.

Until this day, I along with all the others who've heard of the Lindburgh Baby Case, cannot say whether Bruno Richard Hauptmann was guilty or innocent of the crime, but after watching how the investigation went down in this movie I can honestly state that the New Jersey justice system was guilty of something.  Watch this heartwrenching movie to see where lies their guilt. You're also treated to a climactic scene with Samuel Barber's ""Adagio For Strings"" playing in the background. Masterful!",1308441600,5,1293,4.962962962962963
7870756,5,6304343434,"Stephen Rea is spot on as the only person convicted
of the Lindberg baby kidnapping.
I saw this movie many years ago and have periodically
checked to see if it was available on DVD.  No such
luck so far.
The story is intriguing throughout and the actors are
all exemplary.  A rare 5 Star rating by me.",1277596800,,301,4.2631578947368425

7870758,4,6304343434,"I am old enuf to have lived thru this, as a child, so have an interest beyond just a story. This is a very good video of the story..and like those before and after...it remains unsolved altho the law ""got their man""?

I like the actors in this HBO production. Well done and it is a ""heavy"" piece of material hence I don't agree with others that it was overacted.

No account solves this crime but this version is entertaining from that standpoint and informative also. I heartly recommend this video.",1121126400,6,500,4.483516483516484
7870759,4,6304343434,"I know little about the Lindbergh kidnapping, and was shocked at the content of this video.  I thought it was difficult in several respects:  over-acted by the ""heavies"" (except, of course, Michael Moriarty), blatantly one-sided, and simplistic.  However, I was drawn in and very interested in the simplistic, blatant script and found myself alternately puzzled, angry, and enraged. At my age, I admit to surprise in feeling such strong emotion at a display of justice/injustice in America, but this film hooked me and makes me feel naive again.  I will read more about this case; therefore, using the yardstick of intellectual curiosity, I give it a ""5"".  It also entertained me at 4 a.m., so despite the over-acting I'll give it an overall ""4"".",1030492800,6,746,4.983870967741935
7870760,3,6304343434,"Before there was OJ there was the Lindbergh Case.  Charles Lindbergh jr., was
kidnapped from his home in March 1932 and despite the payment of $50,000
ransom he was never seen alive again. Some time later his body was found less
than a mile from his home leading to speculation that he never survived the
actual kidnapping.  For over a year the case went unsolved until a German
immigrant was found to be spending the ransom money.
When arrested the immigrant, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, was initially evasive.
He finally stuck to a story that he had acquired the money from a fellow
immigrant who left him a box for safekeeping while on a voyage back to
Germany.  When that man died in Europe owing Hauptmann money, he opened the
box and discovered the cash.  Figuring that this would serve as repayment
Hauptmann hid the money not telling  his wife or other friends owed money by
the dead man.  The police found this story unlikely and coupled with
Hauptmann's initial falsehoods under questioning they became convinced that
Hauptmann had been the killer and kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby.
The case gave the nation and the world the first ""Trial of the Century"".  A
circus like atmosphere existed outside the courtroom with food and souvenirs
for sale to the excitable crowd.  The evidence presented was circumstantial
but convincing to the jury.  The defense maintained that much of it was
doctored or coerced by the police; this was not convincing to the jury.  The
verdict was guilty and the sentence was death.
Hauptmann was subjected to the ultimate penalty in 1936. But since that date
the datable has raged on.  There are many who are remain convinced by
Hauptmann declarations of innocence and believe that he was railroaded to
protect the careers of those who could not find the real killers.  The more
mainstream view holds that Hauptmann was in fact guilty of participation in
the kidnapping.
This movie is firmly on the side of Hauptmann.  He is shown as an immigrant
who is always hustling for a better life for his family who is chosen as a
convenient victim for the justice establishment.  His view of how he got the
money is taken as fact and his brave stance maintaining his innocence costs
him all possible lenience.  Hauptmann's wife insists that 'the truth shall
set you free' and is determined to prove that her husband was innocent of the
crime.
It is hard to say that any movie with Isabella Rossellini is not the best,
however this movie does have some serious flaws.  While made in the 90s the
producers seem to feel that it was necessary to have the actors act like it
was a 1930s gangster movie.  Most of the 'bad guys' (The police and DA) are
just a little too into playing the tough guys and a little too uninterested
in discovering the facts of the case.  It sets a jarring note that continues
throughout the whole movie.
It is possible that there were shady dealings and a rush to judgement.  But
some facts are indisputable.  Hauptmann was found possessing $14,000 of
ransom money.  He did lie to the Police and the Lindbergh baby was dead.
Some facts are undoubtedly lost to history forever, but this does not give
the producers the right to make them up and then package them as history.",1011657600,8,3223,4.679078014184397
