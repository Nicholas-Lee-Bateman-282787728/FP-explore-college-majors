8426197,4,B004DURSPI,"Saddle up with the most legendary cowboys and notorious outlaws of America's western frontier in this comprehensive collection from the History Channel. THE REAL WEST - COWBOYS AND OUTLAWS draws the line between the facts and fictions behind the fabled men of the frontier and the myths that surround them. Learn the real story of former rebel soldier turned outlaw Jesse James, his James gang, and the treasure hunt that seeks to uncover the truth behind James' complicated nature. Reacquaint yourself with anti-heroes Billy the Kid and Doc Holiday, as well as lead-slinging lawmen like Stephen F. Austin and his illustrious Texas Rangers. Then meet the real men behind the show business legends of """"Wild Bill"""" Hickok and """"Buffalo Bill"""" Cody through authentic diary entries, period accounts, rare photos, and expert commentary. And get up close and personal with two of the most dreaded names in Western lore, Smith and Wesson.

This set is very interesting. I really enjoy watching documentaries about Outlaws and the Old West, to me it's always a great watch. On this set you'll find 9 episodes on 5 DVDs, for a total of 8 hours. All 9 episodes are very interesting and full of great information, and I'm sure you'll learn two or three things (maybe more) while watching these shows. A lot of these History's ""History Classics"" DVD set are disappointing, but this one isn't. If you like watching Historical documentaries or shows about the Old West then buy this set, you won't be disappointed. :)

The 9 episodes you'll find on this set are:
* Buffalo Bill
* Wild Bill Hickok
* Legendary Cowboys
* The Law from Behind The Tin Star
* The James Gang
* The Texas Rangers
* Outlaws: the Ten Most Wanted
* The Guns That Tamed The West
* Jesse James' Hidden Treasure",1335398400,24,1768,4.79344262295082
