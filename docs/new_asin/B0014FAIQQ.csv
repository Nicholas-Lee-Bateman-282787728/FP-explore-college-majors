8255531,1,B0014FAIQQ,"too much talking, too much songs, his ABC sistem its a joke, not even him knows it , is reading everytime to remember it, it's confusing and boring. about the video quality im gonna say that video it's a 5/10 and audio a 4/10 . chris is a great drummer but doe's not know how to teach wich its very important when you make a LEARNING DVD.",1370131200,,338,4.059701492537314
8255532,5,B0014FAIQQ,Chris Coleman is an incredible drummer and has his own system for gaining maximum independence from the drum set.  There are also in person interviews and extras.  This DVD is better than most and I have them all.,1363737600,,213,4.578947368421052
8255533,3,B0014FAIQQ,"While I really love Chris' virtuosity, I was not entirely satisfied with what I received in this DVD. 75% of the DVD was just watching Chris when I was expecting to get a more educational lesson. Forgetful, but entertaining none the less. Good chops, Chris!",1289865600,3,257,4.733333333333333
8255534,4,B0014FAIQQ,"O.k first off I must say to everyone that you should buy these dvd's according to where you skill level is.  A lot of these dvd's are made for you to see their ideas, learn from them and build on them.  If you want technique get a book or a dvd that teaches on that aspect of drumming.",1240963200,,285,3.896551724137931
8255535,3,B0014FAIQQ,"Firstly i want to make sure i point out that i did not watch the segment of the dvd that includes chris with a bass player as i was much more interested in his drumming instruction. Now i've watched chris coleman videos on the drummerworld site and he is an absolute beast of a player, he seriously flys around the kit like lightning, great technique. I was really disappointed that he did not touch on moving around the kit, or technique at all in his instruction. The main focus of his instruction was reading and understanding Rhythm, Counting and independance. Apart from that there's a few quick interview's with chris ( this is where the he talks about god ) i made a note of that in the title because i believe its abit off putting to us of a different belief system. Some great songs performed by chris and the band ( again monster playing ) the camerawork and production of the dvd was not the greatest ( camerawork was trying to be too fancy for a drumming dvd, lots of slow pull outs while he is doing a crazy fill hence missing some of the vision of the fill ) also the quality of the video was good but not great ( when he is doing fast hand work, it tends to motion blur more than usual ) i believe this is due to the length of the dvd at 117 minutes. Production was referring to the menu ( it takes abit of time before you can actually access the menu ).

All in all i think that people will find some helpful theory on drumming but if your looking for anything on technique you might want to go get Jojo Mayers dvd.",1220745600,7,1531,4.189830508474576
