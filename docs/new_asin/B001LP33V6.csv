I highly recommend these for the whole family....  as long as adults are around to explain some of them. :-)",1523318400,,232,4.658536585365853
8319302,3,B001LP33V6,"I had this collection set on my video shelf for so long that it was time to actually watch it on DVD. While I'm working on my laptop, I have a spare laptop to watch DVDs. The collection comes with four DVDs with about 50 cartoons on each DVD.

The quality of the cartoons may be mixed at best. Some cartoons age better than others. The first volume include 1-17 Superman; 18-42 Betty Boop; 43. Mighty Mouse; 44. Woody Woodpecker; 45-49. Casper; 50-57 Hunky & Spunky; 58-64 Little Lulu; 65-74. Clutch Cargo; 75-76. Mutt and Jeff; 77-88. UB IWerks Comicolor; and 89. Toon Town to number 100.

The second volume includes 1-24 Popeye; 25-30 Little Audrey; 31-36 Gabby; 37-40 Herman the Mouse; 41-44 Molly Moo Cow; 45-54 Clutch Cargo; 55-65 Colonel Bleep; 66-77 Felix the Cat; 78-89 Max Fleischer's Color Classics; and 90-100 Mel-O-Toons.

If I have a problem, it is the lack of organization in the programming. I don't like the Clutch Cargo split into two different volumes. It loses the continuity. I grew up watching these cartoons on television so this was a nostalgic journey in time for me. The cartoons then were designed for young children and I am fond of them as well. Perhaps my favorite was the Popeye and Betty Boop.",1439337600,,1224,4.657407407407407
8319303,3,B001LP33V6,"This set is more family-oriented than the Giant 600 Cartoon Collection, but this also takes away a lot of the charm. Casper, Superman, Betty Boop, Woody Woodpecker, Mighty Mouse - they're all here, along with many other famous characters at their best.

HOWEVER, that's one of the problems with this set. You've seen all of the cartoons before - they're the same ones that are on every DVD at your local dollar store. There are some uncommon ones (COLONEL BLEEP, MOLLY MOO-COW, MUTT AND JEFF) but most are just the same ones that have been on TV for the last 40 years. This isn't to say that they're not good cartoons, they're just not anything a collector would want.

But there is one exception - JOHN HENRY, a 'Puppetoon' by George Pal. This film is based on an African-American folktale. It tells of John Henry, a strong man who sets out to prove that no machine can do the work of a man. He enters a competition to beat a machine called the Inki-Poo at laying down railroad tracks. John Henry wins, but dies of fatigue, and 'lives on in the hearts of men everywhere.' This cartoon cannot be found on ANY other DVD set, so if you want it, you'll have to buy this one.

In short, it's a good set for your kids, but if you want to see some lost treasures of animation, look elsewhere. :)",1363478400,,1289,4.384937238493724
8319304,1,B001LP33V6,"I bought this set of DVDs from the local store. It's on sale for about  of the price listed here. However, it's still a waste of money. It's because 97 percent of the shows are bad. Moreover, they look blurry and faded. I like the six Casper shows in this set. Later, when I bought 2 Casper DVDs from Amazon, I found out the video quality was much better.

In short, save your money and stay away from this.",1347494400,,407,4.139240506329114
