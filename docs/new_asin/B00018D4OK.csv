8007892,2,B00018D4OK,"Alright so I hit hard times and had to sell off my anime to make ends meet, a long time passes and I get bit by the anime bug and want to restart my collection,  I start with 10 Tokyo Warriors...not a promising beginning.

  The story goes that 400 years ago a War Lord called the Demon King came to power and 10 Tokyo Warriors had to rise up and defeat him and now every 400 years the Demon King revives to try and take over the world and the 10 warriors are reincarnated to fight him once again.

  First the good points, well the animation is not bad. no it's not tier 1 animation but it is serviceable and at least does not make your eyes want to bleed out.  The First 3 episodes on disc 1 set up the story pretty well and shows most of the 10 warriors, some of the fights scenes are pretty good or at least I thought the Commander of the group mirror attacks were pretty clever, each warrior has control of a certain force, fire, wind, light, shadow etc etc.

Now for the bad.

  If you do buy this anime for the love of all that is descent watch it subtitled the dubbing is horrible and it's not the voices themselves that makes it bad just the delivery of the lines are so bland and mono toned that it becomes painful to listen to. I mean I have to go back to the 80's to hear this bad a dub, I enjoyed my second watch on subtitled so much more.
  Now as I said above the first disc sets up the story pretty well, have not a clue as to what happened on the second disc, you find out that Mika died whoever the hell that is, and that the 10 Tokyo Warriors previously just had a big battle in which one of the new characters who turned out to be a Warrior betrayed them, but it's ok because he never made an appearance in disc one.
  The biggest problem is that while disc 1 does a decent job of setting up the story line it does not dive into any of the characters so when you pop in Disc 2 to see how the Warriors develop into characters you might actually care for but no you get thrown into a new story line with little to no explanation as to what happened in between so you end up not caring.

  To sum up good idea just not thought out that well and you can find better anime out there.

Well I don't do this very often so I hope it helps let me know what you think

8007893,1,B00018D4OK,"Disjointed.  Unimaginative. Poorly written.  Very poor voice acting and dubbing.  Although it wasn't the dubbing so much as the scripting.  The fight and action scenes were not very good.  Or was it the weapons and/or the powers of the warriors?  You know how a series will have good tunes for opening and closings and then they change to not so good in the middle?  Well this series starts out with ""not so good"". And all this for only 44 bucks!  WOW!!!  Kind of reminds me of how disappointing Saiuki Reload was after Double Barrel when Geneon took over from ADV except this isn't a sequel.  It's like alot of bad action movies where some rich guy wants to give his, not so talented, kid a chance to break into the entertainment busuness and comes up with another ""loss leader"" for tax write-offs.  I didn't buy it.  I borrowed it and after two episodes, I couldn't think of a reason to watch anymore.  I enjoy, almost, all Anime.  I love it!  I own 200+ collections of all types and my advice is...don't waste your money!",1183161600,,1024,4.489130434782608
8007894,2,B00018D4OK,"This is a two disk set with six episodes. The storyline really doesn't get off the ground and I can't say I overly enjoyed watching these OVA's. Most of the anime was well done. But really, spend your money elsewhere. :(",1142812800,,220,4.390243902439025
8007895,2,B00018D4OK,"The story-line and characters of this anime are incredibly cliche. If they make one more anime about Japanese high school student reincarnations of ancient warriors with elemental super-powers, I think the world might explode. You have the hot-headed main character with light powers (so obviously, his ongoing enemy will have shadow powers, duh), the niave and spunky girl character, etc. This anime also pulls a big no-no by having two of the main girl characters purple-haired so you can't even tell them apart. The only reason I'm not giving this show 1 star is because there are some cool moments during the battle scenes. One of the enemies is a giant black dot and before you can make jokes about how pitiful the budget must have been, you appreciate how cool the darn thing looks as it cut through buildings, swallowing people up.",1096156800,3,838,4.8671328671328675
8007896,1,B00018D4OK,"Complete waste of time.  The storyline revolves around ""reincarnated warriors"" who have a Great Mission to defeat a Great Evil while keeping up their high school lives, and so forth. Except there's never any real detail given about these past lives, or what makes them so special.  The characters are all stereotypes, with pretentious ""Warrior"" names.  ('Warrior of Mirrors', 'Warrior of Light', and it just goes downhill from there.)

Calling the characterization 'cardboard' would be great praise.  The art is terrible, the dialogue is worse--either sub or dub--and the plot is contrived.  Even the trailers for other animes are terrible.  There is a continutity gap between disc one and disc two that is never closed, which pretty much nukes any pretense this thing had to a plot.

If you like pointless explosions and meaningless fight scenes, that may raise this DVD set above glorified coaster status for you.  Otherwise, skip this one.  It's much too much money to spend on something of this poor quality.",1094688000,3,1012,5.078787878787879
8007897,1,B00018D4OK,"I own two book cases full of various Anime titles, I've rented scores upon scores more, and have never found one this bad! I cant comment on the animation quality because there was so little of it. Virtually the entire show was nothing but panning over non-animated still drawings with very bad voice over. I thought that maybe if I switched to using subtitles but it turns out that the original language script is just as bad. there is almost no background music. After finishing the first disk in the set I was sickened to find that this title came with a second disk to prolong the agony.  I would rather spend my time watching Barney or TeleTubbies than sit through this one again.",1090800000,,685,4.524193548387097
