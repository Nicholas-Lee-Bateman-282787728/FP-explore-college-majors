684439,5,630355346X,"I have enjoyed Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman for many years. It was on early Sunday mornings. Shintaro Katsu is the actor I love the most for this character, the other falls short of the feel of reality for me.",1369440000,,210,4.410256410256411
684440,5,630355346X,"Zatoichi is a nice guy and agrees to delivery a note to a girl in the inn, an inn which happens to be in the direction he is going.  You see, he plans to visit a mountain during the New Year's celebration to enjoy the first rays of the sun on a fresh, delightful, everything will be happy ever after, New Year.  Well, as you can guess, as with most of the movies, he will be very disappointed.  First off, a corrupt boss decides to take more than his fair share of the profits from the businesses and performers who come to help celebrate the coming of the New Year. Then the letter goes to the girl, turning out to be from her brother, who is wanted for a crime he DID do - but swears he was tricked into doing.  Well, I could explain the rest of the plot but you already know it.  And the daughter of the man he killed is in town...well, you get the idea.
The point is, even with the feeling that this is the same plots just put in a blender, the movie is still wonderful to watch.  Lots of comedy, drama, and tragic events.  One of the sub-plots is the fact that the town drunk got split off from his son at the same time that Zatoichi was separated from his father.  For awhile there we think there may be a somewhat happy ending.
The festival is a good excuse for many of the actors to be dressed in wonderful, colorful outfits and many of the kimonos worn by the women are also a delight to see.  And Zatoichi still has problems getting much of the rice into his mouth.  Shinaro Katsu truly has wonderful timing when it comes to anything he does.  And he gives this impression that he ENJOYS the part too.
There are also the gangsters which means there is lots of gambling, drinking, and fighting!  A movie for the whole family!",1296777600,,1734,4.1741741741741745
684441,5,630355346X,"Another fantastic entry into the series of 26 films. This is easily one of the best film series ever made. And this film is another 5 star in the series. The combination of comedy blended with just enough dazzling swordplay really puts this film over.

A great film and if you are lucky enough to own a copy count your blessings. It took the grace of God for me to find a copy out there for less than $95! I cannot understand why out of a 26 film series with all other titles available numbers 9 and 11 are the only ones unavailable.

These are great movies. The Zatoichi series is a classic and they should be avaialble for the public without having to pay ridiculous marked up prices.

Please someone, somewhere listen to the fans!",1267142400,,733,4.375
684442,3,630355346X,"Another great entry in the famed Zatoichi series. Fast paced action, great story, and remarkable personality from the ever pleasing Shintaro Katsu as the the famous blind swordman. Add this to your Zatoichi collection.",1257206400,,218,5.4411764705882355
684443,5,630355346X,"In Zatoichi 9 you really get behind the character played so well by Shintaro Katsu. You want to see him ultimately slaughter the evil bosses who are oppressing the merchants so shamelessly. This film features a little more comedy than is the norm, using two classic Japanese comedians cast as bungling merchants. The comedy is tame but sweet and the action is violent and justified.",1198800000,,382,4.892307692307693
684444,4,630355346X,"This review is for Zatoichi No. 9 and No. 10 below. The amazon system has errors and will not post the #10 review [sends it to Zatoichi #10 & #13].

This 9th entry of Zatoichi ""ADVENTURES OF ZATOICHI"" has some of the most splendid cinematography around. Amazing that these episodes are so beautiful to watch. This 9th entry of Ichi, finds the protagonist asked to deliver a letter to Sen [Eiko Taki] And once again Zatoichi finds himself battling the villians. Villagers, entertainers and merchants are told that the New Years business tax has been upped to 40%. More than twice the previous amount. It appears that the new intendant Gorota Kajima [Akitake Kono] is trying to profit at the townspeople's expense.

Meanwhile Boss Jinbei [Kichijiro Ueda] has been installed as the enforcer to the new intendant. Caught in the middle of all this is Zatoichi, being the good-guy that he is, he takes on the band of ruffians, and in this predictable Ichi episode, the blind masseur manages once again to get rid of the ""bad-guys"" Even if he doesn't get the girl. Recommend [Stars: 3]

  ZATOICHI NO. 10 ""ZATOICHI'S REVENGE""

""I don't know who sent you, but you only get one life,"" says Zatoichi looking down upon the bodies of 3 assassins he has just dispatched with his cane-sword. And so begins the 10th entry of the long running Zatoichi series. It has been 10 years since Ichi was last in the village of Azabu. Looking for a dear friend, he is saddened to hear that Hikonichi, his friend has been felled by a skilled swordsman.

Enter Tatsugoro, the new boss of the town. And not a very nice person to boot. He has a thriving brothel business, courtesy of young women forced into prostitution on false charges of debts owed to them by husbands and fathers. Miss Sayo is the daughter of Hikonichi--and Ichi is upset to learn that she now works at the brothel. Tatsugoro and his henchmen have devised a system they think is foolproof for income. Kill the men, and take their women. Open up shop and everything will be just fine. Right? Wrong! What they don't expect is a blind, cane-sword wielding masseur by the name of Zatoichi.

This is a very good episode. One ""bad-guy"" samurai in particular who just can't wait to challenge Zatoichi is Koheta Kadokura. He gets his chance by the way: And he won't be reprising his role in episode #11, or any other after Ichi get's through with him. Or the rest of the evil villians in this episode--which is quite a few ""bad-guys.""  As Ichi commences to depopulate the male population while freeing the enslaved women, all returns to normal in the village of Azabu. Highly recommend. [stars: 4]",1157241600,2,2631,4.665226781857451
684445,5,630355346X,"Zatoichi#9 The Adventures of Zatoichi has the blind masseur once again trying to do someone a favor and facing unexpected problems. By delivering a note to a young woman who works at the inn where he is going to greet the new year, Master Ichi becomes involved in the plots of Jinbei, the local Yakuza crime boss. He meets Miss Sen, whose brother was betrayed by Jinbei, and Miss Saki, daughter of a village headman last seen in the nearby area. The two women's stories are intertwined as Zatoichi attempts to help them both.

The Japan shown in the Zatoichi movies is not the Japan of Kurosawa and Mifuni.

It is rural Japan made up of small villages controlled by easily corrupted Yakuza bosses. The code of Bushido doesn't apply: any Samurai are usually masterless ronin devoid of any high standards. Crime is common; peasants and bandits survived as well as they could. Life was often miserable.

Zatoichi is a Japanese movie icon because of the acting of Shintaro Katsu. Master Ichi is unique because of his personal code of honor- be kind to those who deserve it, but beware to those who would take advantage of a homeless blind man. He hopes never to have to draw the razor-sharp sword hidden in his cane, but usually has no choice.  The sword-fighting scenes are superbly choreographed, realistic, and full speed with no slow-motion slice-and-dice shots.

Watch for the interactions between Ichi and the children he encounters. He respects innocence in any form. Also pay heed to his treatment of the elderly alcoholic beggar called `Gramps' in the subtitles.

Viewers would expect a homeless blindman to be deeply cynical, soured by the misery and evil surrounding him. Zatoichi believes in justice, no matter what life brings him. All the Zatoichi movies are available at Amazon. They are well worth watching. I recommend them highly.",1123372800,37,1844,4.875399361022364
684446,5,630355346X,"I just caught this one during the weekend on IFC (Independent Film Channel) here in the good ole USA. And a feeling of joy came over me, as I realized the people at HVE, (Home Vision Entertainment, who are also the distributors of the famed Criterion Collection dvd's) in conjuction with Janus Films, must be coming out with series 9, 10, and 11, in the next series of ""Zatoichi The Blind Swordsman"". My first thought was to come over here on Amazon, and to see if it was indeed true that they were coming out with these next 3, and to my delightful surprize, they are, on August 19th, 2003. They are all  numbered, just like their famed Criterion's that they put out. But the numbers of these, are also in conjuction with how the order of the series ran. They've been showing the first 8 on IFC for so long now, and when I saw this one, I knew they must finally be putting the next 3 out. That's how they been doing them over at HVE, is putting them out by 3's. There's 26 total in the Zatoichi series, and it looks like they're going to keep going for now with them until they get them all? Hopefully, this is the case? These series of Zatoichi are so much fun to watch. I just happened one day to catch one on IFC, and I had to learn more about this man they call Zatoichi, played by the loveable Shintaro Katsu, in a very convincing role. You'd swear he was born with that cane sword in his hand, he uses it with such ease & style. These series mix adventure, with comedy as well, as Zatoichi meets foes in every town he happens upon. Helping out the weak, and needy. You can't help but love the guy. In this one titled, ""The Adventures Of A Blind-Man"", he happens to go to a town for the celebration of the New Year, and meets a woman who believes her father is either dead, or just missing. And another woman, who's brother was double-crossed by a gang of Yakuza's after murdering a man who the bosses wanted murdered because he knew too much. In the process the Yakuza bosses set this woman's brother up, to cover their own little scheme of corruption among the people in this town. So he's been on the run ever since and wants to go into Exile, but not before gettin these people who double-crossed him. Because the man who they double-crossed also knows too much, and they want to silence him forever. It's a game of cat & mouse. Zatoichi, being the man that he is, wants to help these two young ladies out, but also doesn't want to make anymore enemies, as that's all he pretty much has. He does what he's good at, and Zatoichi once again goes into battle to help these woman out, but not everything goes as planned, and Masseur Ichi must face one foe who believes he can take the blind-man in battle. A very exciting movie, as they usually are with the Zatoichi series. I for one, cannot wait until they come out on dvd, but will continue to watch, hopefully, the next two in the series if they continue to show them on IFC on their ""Samurai Saturday's"". I own all the series so far that they put out, and they are the prize of my Samurai collection that I have. Zatoichi is an overlooked folk hero of sorts, in my opinion, because he's overshadowed by the likes of Akira Kurosawa, and Tishiro Mifune. But Zatoichi holds his own, and does it with such grace & style. He is most certainly a legend in Japanese Cinema, and a well beloved, respected man in his life as an actor. Shintaro Katsu pasted away a few years back, but his memory lives on in these ""Zatoichi The Blind Swordsman"" series. They are a must have for any Samurai fan, and a great addition to collector's collection's everywhere, in my opinion. Rest In Peace my friend, and thanks for the memory's",1057536000,17,3674,4.3246376811594205
684447,4,630355346X,Zatoichi at it again. The humble massuer stumbles into to a town or person and brings the corrupt and wicked to justice with his fast and furious swordwork. This film is another great installment of the Zatoichi series. These movies are all highly entertaining and a joy to own and watch. These films were all made in the 60's but are of a really high quality. What I like most about these films is that they deal more with the common people of that era of Japan rather than just dwelling on the Samurai cast. Highly recommended.,1007856000,16,529,4.463917525773196
684448,5,630355346X,"Zatoichi - blind swordsman of feudal Japan is a surprisingly believeable yet unlikely hero. Despite vices of drink, smoking and gambling -- he consistently defends the weak and powerless during this hour and a half,  fun filled movie that shifts seamlessly from fast action to humor and  finally to deep human sentimentality in a way that is not often shown in  Japanese movies. I recommend this movie highly for anyone interested in a  light hearted mixture of action and humor.",942537600,11,479,4.95

The betrayal at the end is absolutely great and well earned. The sword fighting is excellent and the battle scenes well choreographed.
