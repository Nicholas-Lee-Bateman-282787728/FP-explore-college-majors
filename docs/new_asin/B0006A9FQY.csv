So basically its a good  movie nothing great not going to get cult status or become a classic but it was good and worth a viewing. I know I would pay no more than $13 or so for this flick. Me personally wouldnt buy the flick for that much while good just not in my relm. Maybe if it was any where from $5 -$10 then yes other words no. And not for no reason just nothing im really into, but like I said a good =viewing and not dissapointed. Rent b4 you buy just my  opinion.",1121558400,,602,3.846774193548387

2179712,2,B0006A9FQY,"I cant believe some clown from Tennessee gave this movie 5 stars (maybe he helped produce it). We are talking 5 stars? ""best movie you ever seen""!! Phfft! stick to the Jack Daniels dude!

Let me summarize: Low budget, bad acting, picture quality was better than most B horror movies, even though it was a dark picture (even in the sunlight), stupid, and unoriginal. How was it unoriginal? Most horror movies are ripped off ideas of others, but this one steals almost everything from `wrong turn' and `blair witch'. How was it stupid? Add the bad acting on top of the terrible lines and you have the recipe for vomit. One point I should add, I think this movie was going for the record of saying the F word (which I'm not an old prude by any means) I just thought it was out of place, and actually stated getting retard. (especially when you have managed to fit the F word 3 times in the same sentence, as a verb, noun, and adjective) I'm all for profanity, it makes me laugh, but I wasn't laughing, it just didn't fit in when it was being said. Very poor writing. Next, My biggest complaint of all was IT IS BORING!!!!!!!!! The girls go for a walk in a mind field of bear traps that last for  of the movie. The guys hunt the inside of the house for 2/4 of the movie. You will be bored out of your brain just waiting for these people to become the obvious victims they were meant to be.

Summary: its defecation, however I gave it an extra star for what minimal blood it did have, especially what he does to his mother. Plus the extra star is for the picture quality (usually on movies with this low budget you tend to get a grainy picture).

P.S. I can't believe how much they are trying to sell the piece of garbage for. I laugh at all who buy it.",1108857600,3,1748,4.24024024024024
2179713,2,B0006A9FQY,"I love slasher movies but I admit that the hokey cover box of this movie scared me off a little bit.  Then I found out the film was directed by James Merendino and picked it up right away.  Merendino is the stylish director behind SLC Punk, a heartfelt indie film about the Salt Lake City punk scene in the mid-80's and one of my favourite movies of all time.  Sadly, none of the director's trademark originality or unique style are present here.  Evil Remains, sadly, is a derivative and mediocre slasher.

The first scene takes place on a New Orleans plantation in 1982 where a young boy inexplicably murders both of his parents, Michael Myers-style.  Flash forward to 20 years later where a graduate student decides to write his thesis on this very same plantation that has been abandoned for so many years and rumored to be haunted.  So he brings a notebook, a camera and 4 of his friends to spend a couple of days on the plantation grounds in the hopes of writing a killer thesis.  Surprise surprise the plantation grounds are not deserted and the boy who many believed died 20 years ago is there to slice and dice anyone who dares venture into his home.

One thing I'd like to mention is that you should not let the horrible cover scare you away, as it seems to imply that this would be a slasher film for the pre-teen set.  This is actually a very dark, scary and sometimes gory film that does have a few things working for it.  The plantation grounds and its surrounding woods make for a creepy setting and the film maintains a high level of intensity throughout.  But whatever ""Evil remains"" has going for it soon gets eclipsed by the fact that the cast are annoying characters who yell all the time and get killed off way too quickly.  Only the Estella Warren character has a backbone to her.

I also would have liked the villain to be developed in more detail.  In the prologue of twenty years back he was introduced in an intriguing way but as the film progresses we never actually uncover any secrets about him nor do we catch a glimpse of him as he just keeps running around with that stupid goat's mask on his face.  What had the potential to be a great new villain in horror lore ends up being nothing more than a bland shape in a goofy suit.  Another disappointment was the absence of any nudity in the film, especially considering that the two lead characters are lesbians.  Such wasted potential.  I kept expecting Merendino to inject his film with a twist or surprise but it never happened and this ended up being predictable and derivative.  I still think he's a great director however ""Evil Remains"" has convinced me that horror movies just aren't his specialty.",1107043200,5,2684,4.5175983436853
2179714,5,B0006A9FQY,"i just rented this movie the other day from blockbuster. to be honest after watching the movie the cover art on the dvd package sucks! it makes it look like a total b movie with the evil little face and estella warren with her boobs almost hanging out and why is the girl behine her in the cover blond in the movie shes brown haired and has dreds! oook lol. BUT i was wrong the movie itself is great. it has very creepy camera work as in shots of scenes and how they were taken by angles and such.  the movies color is great! a little dark at times but for a low budget movies its looks like one of those bigger  budgeted studio financed ""in theatre"" cameras used.

the music was very creepy it was like light errie ghostly whispers! and was put out more on the scenes when needed.

the original sound on the dvd is in dolby digital stereo wich is only the two front speakers

but I RECOMMED if you got a dolby digital 5:1 or 6:1 surround sound to set it at

dolby prologic 2 decoding.

set it on that when watching it the sounds ALL come out thru all front and back speakers brings the movie more to life! trust me just set ur surround reciever to prologic 2 sourround sound format on your reciever

 and wow better then what they use on the disc LOL.

as for the story its was nothing new really boy is nuts.

kills parents and then is there really a

""haunting""

 at the plantation or a curse?. and then these young look like college kids to me go investigate and then chaos begins sorry im not gona say what cuz i don't wana ruin it for you haha.

but the acting is VERY good all are above b actors. kinda almost seems like they should be doing bigger movies then this but hey you gota go where the money is i guess.

but the actors bring this movie to life more BESIDES THE MUSIC and the creepy cinamatography.

the thing that made me laugh was that old man RED from that 70's show is in this movie for like a cameo but i was like oook why  is he in a horror movie?.

BUT ANYHOW go watch this movie turn off the lights raise up the dolby prologic 2 surround sound ""recommended"" and get ready for the heebie jeebies!.",1106438400,5,2121,4.116788321167883
2179715,3,B0006A9FQY,"Evil Remains references, pays homage to, or just blatantly rips off every classic as well as recently released horror movie. In the first two scenes, there are snippets of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Blair Witch Project, Jeepers Creepers, The Hills Have Eyes, The Evil Dead, Halloween, and fill in the blank, because when the credits roll you will be hard pressed to name at least one slasher film that hasn't been scavenged.

Nonetheless, this is a solid if not very memorable movie. Director James Merendino forgot it takes a lot of humor to glue together so many disparate pieces but that doesn't stop him from referencing two similar films that were quite funny, House of 1,000 Corpses and Cabin Fever. As a result a movie that could have been good is just a cut above the average slasher flick, no pun intended. Merendino also left out another essential ingredient for this genre: T&A. This will not start a trend.

The story is otherwise boilerplate slasher. Five students prowl around an abandoned plantation that is the subject of a vague legend. Four will die and one will live, and with this movie that isn't a spoiler. Two of the three male students are brothers, bonded by what apparently was a bad childhood (guess what happens before we know).

Yeoman acting is bolstered by standout performances from an uncredited Kurtwood Smith as the sagacious shrink and Estella Warren and Ashley Scott as lesbians who tag along to help on the ill-defined graduate work. The on-location New Orleans scenes also lend a creepy atmosphere to this otherwise ordinary film.",1105056000,17,1575,4.891385767790262

2179728,2,B0006A9FQY,"EVIL REMAINS (2003) - Uninvolving and boring Louisiana-lensed horror flick originally released as TRESSPASSING (the version I watched on Amazon Prime through my Roku streaming player [an excellent device, especially the Roku 3] had this title). College student Mark (Daniel Gillies) is doing his thesis on myths and legends, trying to prove that they were once based on truth before being blown out of proportion over time. He interviews Dr. Theodore Rosen (Kurtwood Smith in what amounts to an extended cameo in the beginning and end of the film. He is also the best thing about this film.) about the legend of Carl Bryce, who, ten years earlier, first killed his dog, made a mask out of the skull and then killed his father (Will Rokos) with a pair of garden shears and burned his mother (Maryam d'Abo) alive by pouring gasoline over her body and then setting her on fire (this sequence opens the film). Legend has it that anyone who sets foot on the Bryce property will become insane, not trust anyone and may be murdered by Carl, who was never found. After a stern warning by Dr. Rosen not to set foot on the property, Mark decides not to take his suggestion and brings his brothers Eric (Jeff Davis) and Tyler (Clayne Crawford), as well as lesbian lover friends Kristy (Estella Warren) and Sharon (Ashley Scott), along with him to the Bryce property to help him document his thesis with video and sound. As soon as they set foot on the property, the three brothers investigate the inside of the house, while Kristy and Sharon walk through the woods surrounding the house. From the moment they step into the house, the brothers begin to hear voices and creaking floorboards and Tyler photographs a figure in a dog skull mask on his Polaroid camera in the basement. Eric ends up missing, so Mark and Tyler head to the attic after witnessing one of the bedroom walls seeping blood. They find Eric hanging upside down, his throat slashed and tied to boards like an upside down Jesus on the cross. Paranoia quickly begins setting in both Mark and Tyler, who blame each other for Eric's death and there's talk about Tyler murdering their abusive father when they were kids. Meanwhile, Kristy and Sharon find a whole bunch of animal traps littering the woods (Kristy frees a rabbit caught in one) and Sharon accidentally steps on one, injuring her foot.  Kristy uses a tree branch to set off every trap she finds and, as she disables the final one while heading back to the house with a limping Sharon, Tyler is killed in the attic when he walks directly into a giant bear trap that impales his body from head to toe. Mark is then chased throughout the house by Carl and as Mark makes it out the front door, Kristy and Sharon see him pulled inside by the dog skull masked killer. Kristy and Sharon then fall into a trap next to the house and are locked inside it by Carl. Kristy is able to loosen some bars that lead to a tunnel to the house's basement, as they both become more and more paranoid (especially Sharon, who I wanted to kick in the face). Sharon is killed by Carl and Kristy is chased through the woods, finally making it to freedom when a tractor trailer hits Carl and splatters him into a million pieces. Four years later, a girl interviews Dr. Rosen about Kristy, who now permanently resides in a mental institution, convicted of killing all her friends when no trace of Karl can be found on the truck that hit him. Dr. Rosen tells the girl that he believes that Kristy is innocent and warns the girl not to go on the Bryce property because it brings out the worse in people. THE END. Director/writer James Merendino (WITCHCRAFT IV: VIRGIN HEART - 1992; SLC PUNK! - 1998) offers nothing new to the horror genre besides some lush Louisiana scenery and a cheap jump scare here and there. All the characters are terribly underwritten, so we really feel nothing for them when they die. The only interesting thing about this film (besides Kurtwood Smith, who is listed in the opening credits, but not the closing ones) is the insane music that plays over the closing credits. It's genuinely creepy, something which the rest of the film tried to achieve, but failed miserably. Although the film is not terribly acted, there is almost a total lack of blood (except for the bedroom wall, the sight of a murdered Eric and the stabbing death of a welder who calls the police for Kristy). Why bother making a stalk 'n' slash flick and be stingy on the slash? I can't in good conscience recommend this film. It's not terrible, just boringly ordinary.

2179732,5,B0006A9FQY,"A group of fun-loving friends (2 women and 3 men) investigate a legend about a cursed plantation. Twenty years prior, a man and his wife, living on the land, were murdered by their son. Now, the house is empty, the property is overgrown, and the air is thick w/ foreboding. Naturally, everyone splits up, the guys indoors, and the ladies outside in the woods. Nerves start to fray as strange things -a human skull found outside, a bleeding wall inside- occur, and  start wondering if the legend might be real after all. EVIL REMAINS (aka: TRESPASSING) uses paranoia, claustrophobia, and fear of the unknown to bring the story to a head.  What this movie has is a growing sense of total insanity, while the confused trespassers find themselves in a trap that gets tighter and stickier. They've wandered into a hellish realm of unreality and disorientation. At no time was I convinced that anyone would survive. Co-stars Clayne Crawford (THE PERFECT HOST) as Tyler, and a cameo by Kurtwood Smith (ROBOCOP).  Best when watched in a dark room, as the scenes are mostly dark...",1365206400,,1072,4.815217391304348
2179733,2,B0006A9FQY,"J. Gillespie's review pretty much nailed it.  Ripping off / referencing virtually every popular horror movie, lack of T&A (when the cover looks like it does, it's almost screaming that you'll have nudity in the film), etc.

What I'd like to add, in sort of disagreement with Gillespie's review, is this - the horrible acting and characters.  The acting is primarily wooden which, along with the complete lack of personality for any of the characters, makes for a boring film.  So many people fancy themselves ""horror"" movie makes these days because they can throw a bunch of blood around or find a supposedly unique way to torture / kill someone.  What they forget it this - if the audience doesn't care at all about the characters, what does it matter?  This film is a perfect example of that, as characters start to drop like flies and none of us really care because they're all basically blank slates.",1362614400,4,904,4.726114649681529
2179734,2,B0006A9FQY,"Sadly, the things I dislike about Evil Remains (aka Trespassing) outnumber the things I do like, so I wasn't all that impressed with the movie.  I hate to start with cinematography, but the manner in which this film was shot has quite a negative impact on the viewer (this viewer, anyway).  I don't know what kind of film the filmmakers used, but it's too dark, and the scenes shot in the daylight look weird and overexposed.  I found it difficult to really see what was going on in certain scenes, and that is a big problem because the plot itself is sometimes confusing.  And all of those weird camera angles are only effective in making me think the director was trying too hard to be artistic or something.

Twenty years ago, a troubled lad named Carl Bryce killed his father and burned his mother alive inside their plantation home.  This only reinforces the legend - dating back to the days of slavery - that this particular piece of land itself is cursed.  It is said that those who set foot on the land supposedly go violently insane.  ""No trespassing"" signs are posted there, but they really aren't necessary.  Until, that is, graduate student Mark (Daniel Gillies) decides to make the curse the subject of his thesis on legend and mythology.  He and four of his friends travel to the house to conduct an investigation, ostensibly to prove that the curse is nothing but bunk.  This is not one of those ""ghost hunter investigations gone wrong"" movies, though.  Mark has a camera, a sound recorder, and no obvious plan for using either of them.  Things do go horribly wrong, however.

I found the storyline confusing.  The effects of the curse make the characters behave erratically, and they even witness strange events differently.  Is the curse real?  Are the things the characters see and hear real?  Is the insane killer Carl Bryce (whose body was never found), a dark entity, or one or more of the characters themselves?  I would say that all of these questions and more will be answered by the end of the film - but they really aren't.  That is why I found Evil Remains so frustrating.  I do have to say that the acting isn't half bad, however, especially when it comes to showing fear and confusion.  It's a good thing, too, because the script and dialogue tends to be rather weak at times.  In the end, though, all I see in this film is unrealized potential.",1337731200,,2374,4.6
2179735,5,B0006A9FQY,"I caught this on late night TV a while back, and at first I thought that I was in for just yet another bad generic slasher/horror film, but after the film starts moving along, and even though there are some scenes early on that look very familiar to viewers that have seen the likes of ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""The Amityville Horror"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and ""The Blair Witch Project"", the plot and the acting and the story are so addicting that it is very hard to turn away...Then, wham, it turns into one of the most ingenious, original, refreshing horror films ever. Psychologically disturbing, supernaturally haunting, and bloody and violent and grotesque in the most brilliant way.

It is very hard to describe this film without giving away any of the plot, and some on here have done that (or have tried), and to do so would ruin the film for those who haven't seen it. For the whole point of the film is the mysterious aura placed all around and inside it. Three guys and two girls (I don't know WHY everyone on here keep wanting to stress that the girls are lesbians...WHO cares???!) go to an allegedly 'cursed' plantation house to investigate. From that point on, the way the story twists and turns, and the way characters turn on one another, lose trust in one another, misplace trust in one another, and question and/or argue about who and/or what they saw and/or seeing will have you on the verge of your seat the entire time until the end of the film.

About the females being lesbian, I thought they made a great couple, I think it saved them from having to have a 'forced' romance between one of the guys (now THAT'S generic!). And it just seemed like EVERY review I read before I wrote mine had that stated in there as if it was something of utter importance, or utter stupidity.

The spookiest part of this film relies on the brilliant use of sounds, like floorboards creaking, walls bleeding and thumping, steps sounding as if someone is coming or going. Loud attic noises. Loud basement noises. Just flat out creepy!

I can't believe I had never heard of this unknown masterpiece of modern slasher/horror, and for fans of good psychological supernatural slasher horror, I heavily recommend this, as I will definitely be buying a copy for myself VERY soon. Don't let the hokey DVD cover fool you (why they choose a cover like that baffles me!), this is along the lines of ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Omen"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Funhouse"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"", ""Psycho"", ""Halloween"", and ""Identity"""" as far as being a very top notch horror film. Very well made, and awesome casting and acting, and an awesome story (even though it may sound rehashed, it's VERY original once it gets going!).

I thought the movie was great, but still had its flaws. Despite the good acting, the movie does little to establish its characters, in particular the two brothers with a troubled past that's brought up but dropped just as quickly in favor of some bloody slasher action. As for the brothers, that was a last minute thing that I almost didn't catch because it was so fast.

I do think a few of the characters could also show a little more common sense. One guy sees a freaky-looking image on a photo he just took, but neglects to show it to anyone else as incentive to leave. Another guy leaps off the roof of the house to escape but actually ends up backing himself towards the front door. And there's one lengthy scene that'll have you shouting ""close the damn door!"" And there was an exciting chase scene through the woods that makes an abrupt segue that temporarily kills the momentum. But, the chase scene, I think, gave way because the filmmaker wanted viewers to think that the guy the female heroine ran to for help was the killer.

And, after seeing this, you may wanna re-think just how careful you have to be in the woods, what with the dangerous animal traps that could so easily kill someone, or at least keep someone trapped long enough for someone to kill them.

Hope this is helpful, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did. If not, then check out a few other 5 star ratings on this film, for they are all valid reviews. This is what great psychological slasher horror is supposed to be.

There is never a dull moment in this, and refreshingly, it's a film where the dialogue is very interesting throughout the film, for with every line of dialogue there is something learned about the characters and/or the plot, and/or both. Great film! Thank you. :>)",1307404800,2,4508,4.625

Was this the reasoning for a son who killed his parents in grisly fashion 20 years ago on the supposed sour ground?

An amiable low-budgeter that starts out sporting slightly above average character dialogue and interaction, a creepy and isolated setting, and fleeting moments of spooky, subtle unsettledness. The midsection sags a bit, though, which is unfortunate considering that is when the expected horror confrontations start happening.

Three guys and two girls (I don't know WHY everyone on here keep wanting to stress that the girls are lesbians...WHO cares???!) go to an allegedly 'cursed' plantation house to investigate. From that point on, the way the story twists and turns, and the way characters turn on one another, lose trust in one another, misplace trust in one another, and question and/or argue about who and/or what they saw and/or seeing will have you on the verge of your seat the entire time until the end of the film.
The spookiest part of this film relies on the brilliant use of sounds, like floorboards creaking, walls bleeding and thumping, steps sounding as if someone is coming or going. Loud attic noises. Loud basement noises. Just flat out creepy!
I can't believe I had never heard of this unknown masterpiece of modern slasher/horror, and for fans of good psychological supernatural slasher horror, I heavily recommend this, as I will definetly be buying a copy for myself VERY soon. Don't let the hokey DVD cover fool you, this is along the lines of ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Omen"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Funhouse"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"", ""Psycho"", ""Halloween"", and ""Identity"""" as far as being a very top notch horror film. Very well made, and awesome casting and acting, and an awesome story (even though it may sound rehased, it's VERY original once it gets going!).
Hope this is helpful, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did. If not, then check out a few other 5 star ratings on this film, for they are all valid reviews. This is what the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" films only wish to be.
And, after seeing this, you may wanna rethink just how careful you have to be in the woods, what with the dangerous animal traps that could so easily kill a Human, or at least keep someone trapped long enough for someone to kill them.
There is never a dull moment in this, and refreshingly, it's a film where the dialogue is very interesting throughout the film, for with every line of dialogue there is something learned about the characters and/or the plot, and/or both. Great mind f**k film! Thank you.",1188777600,,3131,4.704918032786885
2179741,2,B0006A9FQY,"Not Bad Not Great.  Ok lets start off with a group of good looking kids including a  hotter then donut grease lesbian couple with my favorite buck toothed actress Estella Warren and some other girl with dreads. We also have the 2 studs that are petting each other and looking longly into each others eyes, not to worry though homophobes nothing happens at all between any one.
Witch to me is a missed opportunity with theses two young ladies, I mean damn this is a slasher flick and heck this is a new idea for the genre.
Now lets talk about the cover of the dvd witch has some pretty blond girl that does not seem to be in the movie. Look up Trespassing to see the original cover art.
Who is the dude with the red-eyes or what do's the bloody sickle have to do with this flick?
Not bad used for $3.00 bucks off Amazon with a great cast and a weak plot.",1150934400,,853,4.163636363636364
2179742,5,B0006A9FQY,"""Evil Remains"" is one of the most totally captivating, most intense, well-done, horrific and just plain Best movies to come out in what's been a great last few years for movies in general and horror movies in particular, so much so that it's hard to see how this one flew so far under the radar.

  A group of young college students is heading up to do some research on an abandoned estate where violent murders took place some years ago.  Sound familiar?  Well, at First it is (but in a good way, reminiscent to me of the first time I saw the first ""Friday The 13th"" or the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") but ""Evil Remains"" departs from the familiar trail before long.  What we have is a movie that starts shifting and opening up questions as to the real nature of what's happening.  Is this, indeed, ""Friday The 13th"" territory, or is it more along the lines of ""The Amityville Horror"" or even ""The Blair Witch Project""?  Is what's happening real?  If it is, what is the nature of that reality?  The characters don't know, don't have a lot of opportunity to find out, and the more cryptic it gets the better.  ""Evil Remains"" presents multiple possibilities of what's happening and then keeps shifting the scales of probability back and forth and throwing monkeywrenches into the gears at the same time. It's also loaded up with truely interesting and likable characters, many of whom have intriguing backstories that are only briefly referred to or hinted at but that play roles in their own motivations and in the movie's larger story.  And these hinted backgrounds rip open some new possibilities of their own.  I would just leave it at that, vague as it is, but with this movie having gone largely unseen, I'd really like to encourage people to at least give it a chance, and I'm going to point out a few things that I think might draw people in.  I'm not going to go past the halfway point of the movie but nonetheless, if you're already planning on seeing it, you might want to stop reading now.

  ***WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS(1ST HALF OF MOVIE ONLY) AHEAD ****

 - In a lot of horror movies, a variation on one of two approaches is used: show the monster and the mayhem; or don't show it, use hints and suggestions, and let imagination take over.  Both are perfectly valid approaches that have helped create many great horror movies.  ""Evil Remains"" is perhaps the ultimate example of a movie that does both: I don't think I've ever seen such a full-throttle and visually horrific movie that still leaves so much to puzzle out and wonder about and imagine.

 - Fans of truly gruesome horror take note: Leatherface's leather mask is brutally disturbing and Freddy Krueger's razor claws are deadly, but the 'dark bizarre' ante gets upped again here.  Have you ever heard of a killer(?)(apparition?)(hallucination?) that wears the filleted head of a dog he murdered as a mask?

 - If that makes some fans want to turn away from this, it should be re-iterated how interesting and likable the 'non-evil' characters are on here.  All helped along by great acting, and many of them carrying some kind of mystery of their own, these very empathisable characters are, I think, going to win over some viewers who usually shy away from the more graphic horror to how great a lot of these movies can be, from ""Friday The 13th"" to ""House Of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""Saw"", for starters.

 - Speaking of graphic horror, how about human-sized sharp steeljawed snare-trap type devices?  That look nothing like anything factory made but dead-on exactly like something a psychopath with a working forge and sufficient time wuld cobble together in a basement of horrors, or a totally insane, possibly possessed mind, would conjure up?  People who still advocate trappers setting up these things in the woods may think a bit differently after seeing ""Evil Remains"".

 - Finally, if you've liked any of the following (and I know this is an eclectic batch, but this movie aggressively tears open a Lot of possibilities) I'd really urge you to check ""Evil Remains"" out: ""Friday The 13th"" , ""Amityville"" (especially the second one, from 1981), ""Wrong Turn"", ""Fear Runs Silent"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Tourist Trap"", ""Saw"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".

Truly one of horror's great undiscovered treasures.",1131494400,3,4303,4.7937584803256446
2179743,2,B0006A9FQY,"This movie starts out, like most, with a pretty good plot, though it soon deteriorates into just another long, dragged out borefest.  For example, you'll get annoyed with the never-ending card game, as well as the painfully tedious conversations between characters who become possessed (ala The Shining), most notably between Estella Warren's character and her on-screen girlfriend as they hide out (I won't give away more than that, in the event you actually want to see this one).  On the positive side, Estella Warren's acting is actually pretty good (better than The Planet of the Apes, anyway).  In sum, though, I wouldn't recommend this one.

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",1125187200,5,902,4.8311688311688314
2179744,2,B0006A9FQY,"Although set in the usually eerie swamplands of Louisiana, EVIL REMAINS doesn't go too far in advancing the tired cursed land story.  A group of students venture off to a supposedly cursed plantation to disprove the myth of it being cursed.  Seems twenty years earlier, an abused boy murdered his sadistic father and passive mother, but his body was never recovered.  (Hint, hint).  The movie tries to achieve some atmospheric chills and its cast is more than capable, but it's too talky and under-directed to provide true chills.",1124409600,9,530,4.988636363636363
2179745,3,B0006A9FQY,"I didn't think the movie was as bad as some of the others, however it was far from great.  The interesting thing about this movie was that there was a lot of talking.  I was thinking during the first half that if Kevin Smith wrote a horror movie, it might be like this one.

 Unfortunately, the conversation wasn't nearly as interesting as what you might find in a Kevin Smith movie.  The movie didn't pick up speed until the last ten minutes.  I'm not surprised many found it boring.

 I thought the sound was fantastic, and they did a great job of creating a creepy mood.  It was interesting that the first half of the movie followed the 3 guys and the second half followed the 2 girls.  Normally I would have expected more switching between the two stories.

 With horror movies, it's hard to walk the balance of explaining what is going on while still leaving plenty of room for interpertation.  This movie left a lot for interpertation, but didn't give enough answers.",1122854400,,973,4.522988505747127
8040839,2,B0006A9FQY,"Mark, a graduate student is working on a major tome on myths, and after interviewing the psychiatrist (the great Kurtwood Smith in an awkward little bit part near the beginning and end) who was treating Carl Bryce, a boy who brutally murdered his parents, decides to go on a road trip to the site where it all happened on the chance that the land there might be cursed, an urban myth that would help with his book. Once there with a few friends in tow, they discover that they may not be alone in this generic & bland slasher film.

While the opening 'prolog' scene showed promise for the rest of the film, I found my hopes quickly dashed as it turned out highly derivative and had characters who talk and yell to no end that were bland and hard to care about.
