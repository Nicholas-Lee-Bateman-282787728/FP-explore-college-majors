2797189,5,B000OK20ZE,Outstanding movie. I had to have it. I watch TCM alot and saw this movie many years ago. I watch it every time they showed it and made up my mind to add it to my movie collection.,1354492800,2,179,3.736842105263158
2797190,5,B000OK20ZE,"I have seen this several times and always looked forward to seeing it again.  When the opportunity to purchase the disc presented itself I took advantage of the opportunity.

This is a good study of people (no matter where they call home) and in particular the upclose representation of the typical Brit throughout the years.  Not only enjoyable, but, at times, thought provoking.  Think you will enjoy this one as much as I did.",1296172800,5,429,4.756756756756757
2797191,4,B000OK20ZE,"This Happy Breed follows the joys and sorrows of one British family in the period between the two world wars.  Robert Newton is excellent; if you've only seen him in Disney's Treasure Island, you haven't seen his full range as an actor.  This Korean import DVD from World Digital Entertainment is an excellent trsnsfer.  The photography is as clear as a bell, and sound is excellent.  The movie also stars Celia Johnson and John Mills, and was directed by David Lean.",1244419200,17,467,4.728395061728395
2797192,4,B000OK20ZE,"Oh, I knew all the people in this movie--they were my family and friends, albeit in Western Canada, it was so familiar.  Did I enjoy it?  Sometimes, but with 20-20 hindsight, not always.  If I were teaching 20th Century British History I just might include this film for its truths.  I imagine it was a morale booster.  That said, it engaged a couple of hours, more or less, and was engaging!",1244160000,3,392,4.464788732394366
8185503,4,B000OK20ZE,"Maybe I didn't notice in the description (?), but this particular version has the Korean sub-titles on by default. (They have to be disabled.)
The main characters' accents change. At first they're nearly cockneys and toward the end they're nearly full-on RP.
Does Queenie make it to Singapore?
Can't help but think that Monty Python have lampooned parts of ""THB"".
It's a lot like a soap opera. I'm sure if they'd had television then that it would have made the jump.",1468800000,,466,4.765432098765432
8185504,3,B000OK20ZE,"Although the description states that there are Korean subtitles, I didn't expect them to be visible unless closed caption was turned on. They exist during the entire film, so if that will bother you, don't order this print. The video quality is excellent.",1461801600,,255,4.953488372093023

8185509,5,B000OK20ZE,"I'd been waiting for a long time for this excellent Noel Coward film to show up on DVD.  It is the second of his plays which cover the History of England over a generation or so.  The first was 'Cavalcade' which covered from 1899 to 1933, and followed a wealthy family and their servants over that eventful period.  'This Happy Breed' covers the period between World War 1 and into World War 2 in the lives of an average family and their neighbors.  Both are very good and beautifully acted.  I recommend this wonderful film.  You would never expect such an atypical performance from the great Robert Newton.  But everyone in the film is excellent.  I can't help but believe that this film is the source for the great Beatles song 'She's Leaving Home'.  Rent this film or buy it, but above all see it.  JBW",1407024000,2,806,4.458904109589041

8185511,5,B000OK20ZE,"If you too are of a certain vintage, you'll no doubt recognise relatives and people you knew ""way back"" in this quite fascinating film.
The story?
Well it's really about an extended working class British family's time living in a specific house for about 22 years. They move in just as WWI has ended, and move out just as WWII is about to begin. We never see any of the former, and only Neville Chamberlain ironically waving that piece of worthless paper that promised ""Peace in our time"" of the latter.

What happens here are the usual family things, the entertainments, the domestic arguments both petty and serious, the bickering and tender moments, the crises and tragedies, ...in fact just life actually.
Of course the morality is that of an earlier time, with family disgrace always being a threat for what now would hardly be considered transgressions of huge proportion, but you truly grow to care what happens to the characters, and they are most definitely human, with flaws and vanities as well as their admirable qualities.

I particularly enjoy the testy relationship between the grandmother and the aunt. It's a constant battle for emotional sympathy, with wounded feelings and wounding words being exchanged. Often dryly witty, always ending with one or the other retreating huffily, threatening to ""never speak to you again, I'm sure!""
My very favourite lines are those of the Father, who rails against the aunt's constant use of several euphemisms for dying!

Women's emancipation has not yet hit, and so the females here tend to be long-suffering and resigned to their subservient roles, but of course this was a fact of the times.
The one daughter who rebels against this social constraint finds it very hard going, ....and her redemption comes only in the form of once again toeing the line of ""respectability"".

There are genuine moments in this film, some happy and some quite touching, and you are made to feel as though you can share them all. It's certainly not ""glamorised"" in any way. These are genuine people without botox, boob-jobs, teeth whitening or hair-straighteners. One never gets the feeling a whole crew of makeup artists is just waiting to pounce the second the director calls ""Cut"".
The acting is quite restrained here too,...something we are certainly not used to in current American cinema. Massive displays of histrionics and personal emotion were considered very poor form by the Brits back then.

Yes it's nostalgic now, and reminiscent of a far simpler time when roles were distinct and expectations from life were far more modest than what people with their overblown sense of self-entitlement demand now.

This movie probably provides quite a genuine look at the social structure of the time. The very strong sense of duty, and the stiff determination of the Brits to never give in to despair, no matter what life may throw at them. Family, and that's family with all their foibles and frailties , are what counts. That, and getting by and making do.

I've watched this movie several times now, although this is the first time I've seen it in colour.
It's a Korean version, ....don't forget to turn off the Korean subtitles first up, as otherwise they play automatically and become very distracting.
The transfer is nothing special, perfectly ""watchable"", although grainy in parts, but again this actually adds to the period feel of the piece and is completely in harmony with the muted and faded colours representing the interiors of English working class families of the time.
The sets themselves are a wonderful observation of life between the wars, with cretonne curtains, uncut moquette upholstery, and those tea-coloured rose wallpapers that were so ubiquitous.
I'm sure at least a couple of characters will resonate with most adult viewers here, and it's a most enjoyable journey to be a fly-on-the-wall and party to the problems and joys of a simpler time in history.",1363478400,5,3923,4.980152671755725
8185512,5,B000OK20ZE,"To Say this is Nostalgic would I think not be doing this film its full service. I watched it last night and woke up with it still in my head this morning. From the beautiful tracking shot that descends on the neighborhood and the house (predating Hitchcock's famous 'Notorious' shot by 2 years)that serves to host the story to its retreat shot as the story ends, its a journey for the viewer that sometimes leaves you questioning but ultimately wraps up the story in a way that allows you to wonder and surmise on how the characters continue.
It is beautiful film-making. Cowards story packs swift, subtle little punches. (Its not the type of story for which he is remembered). Leans eye is smooth, the compositions of the shots are lovely. I couldn't figure out where the studio ended and the real terrace began in a lot of the scenes. Of note too is the Art Direction. It doesn't flinch from showing the real and often drab conditions that these characters lived in. (Imagine just 15 years later Coronation street was being conceptualized). The costumes are excellent. How often do you see in a movie from this time a real appreciation of the period in which the story is set (see the 1920's part).
The colour is illuminating. You have to admire the foresight of the team involved to film in colour in war-torn Britain. This new restoration is a fine addition to our understanding the times. Taking it out to view last night, I was surpised that it was made so early in the 1940's and while the war was still on.
The cast are good and great. Some of the younger characters are obviously played by older actors. (You cant but be engaged by John Mills at this time but to my mind he always photographed older than was required for the role- Great expectations?)the older parent roles are wonderfully played out and the scenes with the Father interacting with his wife, his son and his friend are flawless.
Finally I have to give it to Lean. Im watching a lot of British movies from this time at time of writing. I am never disappointed. There is a freshness and a clarity to his story telling that resonates. I would recommend his early years box set.",1361059200,3,2151,4.546391752577319
