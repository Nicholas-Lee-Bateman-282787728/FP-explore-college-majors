2925323,3,B000UUX2SC,"I just bought this, and it seems ok, except the fact that there are missing parts and i don't understand why?! Maybe it has to be with the fact that i am watching it on my p/c ..i don't know. Hopefully ill figure it out, if not well thats how this dvd is.! Enjoy",1200441600,,262,3.8703703703703702
2925324,4,B000UUX2SC,"I was hoping this would be more than simply seasons 1-3 packed together but I was mistaken. This box set is the same as buying seasons 1, 2, and 3 separately except it comes with new case pictures and a children's wash-off tattoo. There are a few new special features but they kept the cut scenes out of this version. I really had hoped this would contain the scenes cut from the original dvds.
If you don't already have seasons 1-3 on disk than this is a good deal but if you do this is not worth it. All three seasons are subtitled so if you bought an older version like I did before they subtitled them this is a bit better.

Rebelde: la serie completa es basicamente temporadas 1-3 en una cosita. Si ya tiene rebelde en dvd entonces no compra esto porque no es nada nuevo. La tiene 'los mejores besos', unas videos de rbd, pleitos, 'las mejored escenas de amor', trayecotiras, y una galeria. Si no tiene temporadas 1-3 entonces debes comprar eso porque no es un robo.",1199664000,21,971,4.3646408839779

2925342,5,B000UUX2SC,"It's not widescreen, but it contains English subtitles. I don't know what you expect from these DVDs, it's logical that most of Mexican telenovelas are shortened for the DVD versions because they have too much episodes. This version is good for those who already watched this telenovela and want to remind themselves, but not waste their time by watching again 450 episodes. It's also good for those who haven't watched it at all, they'll miss something, but it won't be important for the understanding of the main plot. You can't expect from publishers to give you the whole series because, especially this, it's too long. It's not like the ""3 Temporadas en 1"" edition because this one has just one box with DVDs and the other one has 3 boxes for each season and also an additional box. However, I find this edition excellent and recommend for buying.",1441929600,3,852,4.763513513513513

2925390,4,B000UUX2SC,"Rebelde - La Temporada (Rebel  - The Season - 812 minutes)

We are in an elite high school where most of the students are from prominent, wealthy families. One, however is there on a scholarship which he sought so he could find and wreak vengeance on the daughter of the man who killed his father.

Our scholarship student, Miguel (Alfonso Herrera, who has an amazingly natural stage presence) is a handsome, smart young man who is immediately attracted to that same girl, Mia (Anahi). Of course he fights it because of his goal.

Then he meets her father, Franco Colucci (Juan Ferrera) and they LIKE each other. This is very disconcerting.

In the meantime, the students start a pick-up band which has a terrible time organizing rehearsals because everyone is so self-centered and irresponsible. One of the principals is Roberta (Dulce Maria) whose mother is an established star, but despite that she shows remarkable common sense and morality.

This series a pretty realistic job of portraying the ups and downs of being teens. I won't own it though. If you want it, Amazon has it for you.",1381622400,2,1091,4.807486631016043

The series is chopped off and edited horribly. You don't even get to watch a full episode, its cut down so much that you don't even know what happens. One second someone hates each other and 2 minutes later, they are making out without knowing what happened. We are both fluent in Spanish, so it wasn't a language issue, it is trying to edit a year long series into a few dvd's. To contrast, we bought ""La Reina del Sur"" and what a difference. This tv series was more expensive, but way, way better.

2925408,5,B000UUX2SC,"I understand what everyone is complaining about, as far as only basically getting the highlights from every season.  But as much as I hate it as well, I highly doubt we'll ever be able to get the ENTIRE show on DVD.

One person mentioned and I paraphrase, ""Let's say season 1 is 20 hrs long...""  Well only problem is just one season alone is a lot longer than 20 hrs.  Remember people, this show was essentially a daytime soap like All My Children.  Lets just say season one only had 50 episodes, and trust me, there were a heck of a lot more than that, at approximately 44 mins each what would already equal 35.67 hrs.  That would be roughly 12 disks or 6 double-sided.  And that's if a season only had 50 episodes.  I can't remember for sure, but each season had to be at least 60 to 80 episodes long, if not more.

It would just be insane to get it all.  Trust me, I'd love it, but insane.

But having said all that.  Since we couldn't get everything on DVD, I do wish they could have concentrated even more on the best parts.  Because they really do leave behind some really great moments in the show or condense them too much.

So in the end, I'm just happy to take what I can get.  Try ordering the new RBD: La Familia.  That was more of a sitcom type of show.  Not as many episodes so you can enjoy that show in it's entirety.  But The Elite Way School it ain't!",1216684800,16,1369,4.140684410646388
