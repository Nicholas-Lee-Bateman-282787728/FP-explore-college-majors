8682027,1,B00O4GU7UY,"My opinion is that Steve's work produces failure. I am not being mean spirited or spiteful in anyway. I am merely telling the truth. I followed Steve's methods for years. I only produced a red powder which is of course, Iron Oxide aka Rust. You can not exalt this substance either and if you add this powder to a molten metal you will only produce fake Gold colored metal.
Steve only became angry when I questioned his methods and why I kept failing and it occurred to me that I kept failing because this is just nonsense. You can't produce gold nor will you ever be filthy rich. Steve has attacked me personally and professionally and that folks is the hallmark of a deranged angry person who is desperate to sell his booklets not truth. The truth just hurts too much for Steve to accept. If he had succeeded he would want everyone to succeed and pursue their dreams but he does not want you to know the truth.",1480204800,,911,4.396449704142012
