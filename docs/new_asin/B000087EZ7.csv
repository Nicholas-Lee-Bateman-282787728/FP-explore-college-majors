It does have a thunderstorm and a little bit of very mild action but it is intended for children 4 and up. It has action without violence which is hard to get for kids. It doesn't give a Bible lesson but shows the characters turning to and relying on God in their everyday struggles, fears and joys. It really has some great lessons to it for a such a simple little show!",1319932800,,520,4.107843137254902
8132198,2,B000087EZ7,"We were able to borrow this DVD from our local Family Video for free. I was plenty disappointed with the quality of the it. The stories were not clever (even confusing) and the animation was unimpressive.
We rented this for our 2 and 3 1/2 year olds who were mildly amused for maybe half of one episode.
The worst VeggieTales video was better than this for Bible lessons, animation, and quality of the writing.
Two of the episodes deal with a nightmare and a severe thunderstorm. It was more intense subject matter than we'd prefer.
I don't recommend this DVD. When I turned it off in the middle of the show and asked if they wanted to watch ""Franklin the Turtle"" they both cheered and my three year old said, ""That one was kind of scary.""",1232150400,,739,4.4411764705882355
