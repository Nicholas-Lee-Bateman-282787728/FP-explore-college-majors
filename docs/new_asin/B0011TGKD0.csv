3067851,5,B0011TGKD0,"This guy is tough as nails! He was in the SAS, has climbed Everest along with other mountains in the Himalayas, he lead a team of 5 in a inflatable boat through the arctics of the Alantic Ocean, he went through the French Foregin Legion for a documentry.

As for the show Man vs Wild he always seems to parachute into some of the most remote places of the world. He has a camera crew who are instructed not to help in any way. Unlike some shows Bear will go out of his way to get his point across, I remember a couple of the Man vs Wild episodes were he jumped in to quickand, freezing water, and a cravas just to show you how to get out and survive.

He shows you what to eat depending on which area he is suriving. Rather it be spear fishing, traping, or just eating edible plants he shows you what to do. I have seen him swallow a small snake whole and act like it was nothing!

Unlike him I would never be caught dead in a forest without a knife but there was one episode were he used flint knapping to make a sharp blade.

As for traveling and navigation he shows you how to use the north star at night and tricks to find north in day. This man has some major stamina too, if you watch you will always noticed he is always on the move and never really likes to take a break.

I will be honest with you, I find a book like SAS Survival Guide Handbook or the US Army field manuals to be more informative. But if you want to visually watch someone survive and use the skills that most surivial books teach then this is the DVD set for you.",1217030400,,1541,4.022875816993464
3067852,5,B0011TGKD0,"Bear Grylls served in the British Special Forces; at the time he climbed Everest, he broke the world record as the youngest ever to do so; he parasailed the same mountain (really, he had an oxygen tank and a special parasail); he is an avid rockclimber, mountaineer, and adventurer; needless to say, Bear Grylls is a pretty cool guy.

That's why Man vs. Wild, a show dedicated to survival, tends to fixate on him; but this isn't a bad thing. The show is only partly instructional; if person wants some real lessons in survival, they need more then just Man vs. Wild.

A review of the show is not complete without mentioning its scenery. Filmed in HD, this show has some great shots of the world's most foreboding wildernesses; wide angle shots are fantastically directed (even if it takes always from the sincerity of the ""survival"" situation.) and Bear always needs to get into a place in an interesting way; weather it's hangliding, parachuting, jumping out of a helicopter, or some other stunt; these scenes, while a bit contrived, are incredibly fun to watch.

There is a gross-out factor to this show, and the editors know it. Bear often has to find food, lacking options, like a fire, he must sometimes eat some disgusting things raw, which is shown in a little too much detail. But even this has a point; it does show what a person must go through in order to survive. Despair, I have heard, is the number one killer; keeping a positive, survivalist attitude is the most important factor.

It's also worth noting that the show doesn't shy away form some of the crueler aspects of life; Bear must sometimes hunt, and kill medium sized animals (sometimes cute ones); it shows the complete process, from capture to preparation to eating. For this the show has taken some heat from environmentalists (I believe there is a petition to get it off the air.) Bear Grylls clearly has a reverence for the beauty of nature, but he is not deluded as to what nature is; he's no environmentalist (at least not by their standards.)

Bear Grylls also took some heat awhile ago for supposedly not being authentic; that he was actually much safer then he said he was. I tend to put such accusations under the same category as the people who where shocked to learn that Ashley Simpson was lip-synching. Of course it's not completely real, the fact that he has a camera crew with him tells you something; the wide angle shots have to be planned, and I'm sure the crew is not scrounging for food like Bear. Still, Bear really jumps into crocodile and leech infested swamps, really boulders that steep rock-face, and really does all the things impossible to fake. There are also times when Bear is clearly nervous, like when a good sized shark was circling his small raft in the pacific.

This might sound cruel of me; but I enjoy watching this show from the safety of my own home; watching Bear Grylls have to ring water out of his own socks; or walk through is water; or futilely try to start a fire in the rainforest; makes me feel cozy.

People don't seem to realize how big this world is, this is only occasionally demonstrated in the media; when a rich adventure's plane went down, the largest single man-hunt in history couldn't find him; and that was in America! This show gives a clear sense of the scale of our planet, and how little of it we actually occupy.

I like this show because it's only star - Bear Grylls- is a clearly confident, competent, and strong individual. It also perfectly demonstrates, implicitly, the importance of technology in our lives, by showing what life is when a person is (mostly) detached from it.",1211414400,28,3623,4.632398753894081
3067853,1,B0011TGKD0,"I write this review because it is important for viewers to understand that a great deal of the ""survival"" advice doled out on this show is not only false but can endanger people if they take it seriously. The makers and distributers of this program are irresponsible and reckless.

Parents, this is mainly a warning for you.

Some of the host's ""techniques"" are baloney, and many of the ""survival choices"" he makes are extremely inadvisable and should not be followed by the average person (or even the intermediate wilderness adventurer).

Most people know by now that the show is faked. The fact that it is faked is of secondary concern to me. (The host sometimes stays in hotels when supposedly sleeping in the wild. Several scenes are obvious set-ups with props, pre-hunted animals, and domesticated animals among other tricks. The crew does a great deal of the work for the host.)

Why is this? Why does he pretend to do these things when he is really faking them? For entertainment certainly, but more importantly because a lot of what he does is extremely stupid. So stupid and far-fetched that not even Grylls himself would do it because he might actually kill himself.

If you want to get your yuks watching a guy eat disgusting things that his crew has found for him (or that his bladder has produced), there's nothing wrong with that. The problem is when people take this joker seriously. If average viewers were to follow his advice if they ever were put in a real survival situation, they would reduce their chances of living and likely kill themselves.

So, parents, either don't let the kids watch this show, or make sure that they understand that it is ""make believe."" They need to know that it is fake and should never be copied, even if they find themselves in a survival situation.

There are better books and programs out there with reasonable and realistic survival advice ( e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survivorman/dp/B000O7862S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survivorman</a>).",1205366400,15,2046,5.126126126126126
3067854,1,B0011TGKD0,"I abosuletly love this show. Some people say Bear loses a lot for having a camera crew and putting himself into certain situations that aren't truly dangerous, but this is a television show and it is supposed to be entertaining.
With that aside, I bought this 6-DVD set from amazon with hopes of it being of high quality. I was sorely mistaken. These are DVD-R transfers from an outside company.
The downsides to this set include:
There are no interactive menus
The letterbox presentation bars at the top are unsteady and shake.
The actual shows are not of DVD quality
On the second disk of part one, it wouldn't return back to the menu after the episode was over, it just returned to the middle of the episode.

I returned this item to amazon and they were very friendly about the entire ordeal. Their customer service has never steered me wrong.

The actual Discovery channel box set of Man vs. Wild season 1 has fixed all of the above mentioned problems because they are the actual DVDs. So in short--if you want a good copy of a great show buy the Discovery Channel DVD's.",1203811200,84,1076,4.541237113402062
3067855,5,B0011TGKD0,"This is a good DVD set if you like the show.  It is pretty bare bones if you are looking for DVD extras.  It esentially has the show and thats about it.  However, if you are like me you don't watch those extra's most of the time anyway.",1202860800,6,236,3.875
3067856,4,B0011TGKD0,"Over all a very entertaining program, but be forewarned that this DVD release reflects the recent re-editing of the episodes.  The original concept of the show has been changed from ""finding your way back to civilization,"" to an on location demonstration of survival technique.  While the original concept was more fun to watch, it had been criticized because various situations were staged without informing the audience.  The re-edited episodes explain when and where Bear receives outside help.  The new concept is more honest, but leaves on the editing room floor scenes that were more staged for their own good, such as the wild horses and bunny kill from the Sierra Nevada episode.

The Hawaiian, the MOAB and the pilot episodes are also missing from this set, as they have been highly criticized for their authenticity.

Also please be aware that this DVD set is presented as non-anamorphic video.

Bear Grylls still comes off as being very charismatic and very hungry.  Despite its short comings, this is still a worthy purchase for any Man Vs Wild fan as it is plenty fun to watch, and you might even learn something.",1198886400,38,1126,4.920634920634921
3067857,3,B0011TGKD0,"Great cinematography, Bear is a good, interesting host.  Why am I only giving this 3 stars?  The fascination fades quickly.

3067859,3,B0011TGKD0,"Felt too short. Too dramatic, and I would have liked more survival information. Ie) they should have showed the flower of the plant he was eating the root of, so we could identify it ourselves in the wilderness. Also, he showed us how to catch a fish, but he couldn't do it himself, so I doubt we could do it either. And, did he really need to scale down the waterfall or could he have used the plants next to the waterfall for footing and handholds and would that have been safer. It's entertaining, but I want to learn realistic techniques.",1445472000,,542,4.376237623762377

3067876,5,B0011TGKD0,I enjoy all survival shows as well as books. The knowledge you gain from them is priceless just as long as you actually do what you see on TV or read in a book. You learn a lot more by experiencing it yourself.,1391299200,,210,3.9069767441860463
3067877,5,B0011TGKD0,I enjoy watching this type of show but at times it gets a little goofy. He caught a fish didn't have any way to start a fire so he bit into the raw thing (still alive) and acted like it was a big juicy steak. Not exactly my cup of tea.,1390867200,,235,3.627450980392157

3067886,3,B0011TGKD0,I think some of his antics are staged just to see if he can gross out the audience but his basic survival skills are interesting to watch. He has a lot of good information on survival if you can get past the theatrics.,1380412800,,218,4.093023255813954

It doesn't mean he is a fake, to the contrary he is careful and operates at a skill level only a few on the planet can claim comfort with.  He isn't a fake.  He is disciplined.

Those of us that have a blue ray know that blue ray or not, it should still play,  therefore this should not have been an issue. Regardless I checked upon their recommendation to find a Blue Ray DVD in the season one and there was no such thing! Even after telling them, I would pay the difference if they could get me a Blue Ray season one, I would keep the old one if they could send a new one that did work, I would pay for an original one if they could let me know it was viewable... and anything else I could say to get across that I just want a DVD that will play in my DVD player... it was all useless! In the end, I still have the defective DVD that will not play... along with a very bad taste for the Discovery Channel.

3067916,5,B0011TGKD0,"Despite what anyone says about either Survivorman or Man Vs Wild, both have different qualities, both are great shows that I love. They have both changed throughout the seasons. You can't say that Man vs Wild is fake. Maybe they put him in staged things here and there to show you how to survive, but that's half the point of the show, to inform the viewer. But he is really jumping off waterfalls, eating bugs, getting sick, taking risks. To think that either of them are really alone in the wilderness is dumb. If there were a real emergency in either case, (even with survivorman, where most people like the fact that he is ""alone"") you can bet the producers of the show would be sending in the lifelines, while the camera men jumped in and helped. If they didn't, and something happened to either of the shows stars, it would be their butts on the line. The reality of it is, they are both t.v. shows! However much you want to believe is real or not, depends on your personal opinion. Survivor man is a good show. Man vs. Wild is a good show. Bear Grills is a good guy with high spirits that takes real risks while teaching you things that could literally save your life. What's not to like?

There are enough people going against the natural world already. That title gives nature a bad name, like it is something you must fight against.  The man has admitted to staging scenes of the show and staying in hotel rooms, to me, that discredits almost anything he has to say about natural living. If you are only interested in entertainment, then this show deserves about three stars. However, if you are interested in learning survival information, or not interested in seeing a fool run around in the woods, I would highly recommend Survivor Man. Also, any of Tom Brown's field guides are great for a person who is truly interested in survival and not just cheap entertainment.",1230163200,9,827,4.823943661971831

3067926,4,B0011TGKD0,"I highly recommend these sets of videos for their entertaining and informational value.......the survival techniques used here are at their most primal and only in very extreme situations would one use them.  However, they can potentially mean the difference between life and death in some situations.  The locations are incredibly beautiful and Bear Grylls (survivalist) gets dropped off in some of the most remote and incredibly scenic places around the world, some are extremely rugged, wild, and inhospitable places where only nature survives.  Bear Grylls  explains the usefulness of the survival technique and is actually experiencing it as he makes his way back to civilization.

3302348,5,B0011TGKD0,"This guy is tough as nails! He was in the SAS, has climbed Everest along with other mountains in the Himalayas, he lead a team of 5 in a inflatable boat through the arctics of the Alantic Ocean, he went through the French Foregin Legion for a documentry.

As for the show Man vs Wild he always seems to parachute into some of the most remote places of the world. He has a camera crew who are instructed not to help in any way. Unlike some shows Bear will go out of his way to get his point across, I remember a couple of the Man vs Wild episodes were he jumped in to quickand, freezing water, and a cravas just to show you how to get out and survive.

He shows you what to eat depending on which area he is suriving. Rather it be spear fishing, traping, or just eating edible plants he shows you what to do. I have seen him swallow a small snake whole and act like it was nothing!

Unlike him I would never be caught dead in a forest without a knife but there was one episode were he used flint knapping to make a sharp blade.

As for traveling and navigation he shows you how to use the north star at night and tricks to find north in day. This man has some major stamina too, if you watch you will always noticed he is always on the move and never really likes to take a break.

I will be honest with you, I find a book like SAS Survival Guide Handbook or the US Army field manuals to be more informative. But if you want to visually watch someone survive and use the skills that most surivial books teach then this is the DVD set for you.",1217030400,,1541,4.022875816993464
3302349,5,B0011TGKD0,"Bear Grylls served in the British Special Forces; at the time he climbed Everest, he broke the world record as the youngest ever to do so; he parasailed the same mountain (really, he had an oxygen tank and a special parasail); he is an avid rockclimber, mountaineer, and adventurer; needless to say, Bear Grylls is a pretty cool guy.

That's why Man vs. Wild, a show dedicated to survival, tends to fixate on him; but this isn't a bad thing. The show is only partly instructional; if person wants some real lessons in survival, they need more then just Man vs. Wild.

A review of the show is not complete without mentioning its scenery. Filmed in HD, this show has some great shots of the world's most foreboding wildernesses; wide angle shots are fantastically directed (even if it takes always from the sincerity of the ""survival"" situation.) and Bear always needs to get into a place in an interesting way; weather it's hangliding, parachuting, jumping out of a helicopter, or some other stunt; these scenes, while a bit contrived, are incredibly fun to watch.

There is a gross-out factor to this show, and the editors know it. Bear often has to find food, lacking options, like a fire, he must sometimes eat some disgusting things raw, which is shown in a little too much detail. But even this has a point; it does show what a person must go through in order to survive. Despair, I have heard, is the number one killer; keeping a positive, survivalist attitude is the most important factor.

It's also worth noting that the show doesn't shy away form some of the crueler aspects of life; Bear must sometimes hunt, and kill medium sized animals (sometimes cute ones); it shows the complete process, from capture to preparation to eating. For this the show has taken some heat from environmentalists (I believe there is a petition to get it off the air.) Bear Grylls clearly has a reverence for the beauty of nature, but he is not deluded as to what nature is; he's no environmentalist (at least not by their standards.)

Bear Grylls also took some heat awhile ago for supposedly not being authentic; that he was actually much safer then he said he was. I tend to put such accusations under the same category as the people who where shocked to learn that Ashley Simpson was lip-synching. Of course it's not completely real, the fact that he has a camera crew with him tells you something; the wide angle shots have to be planned, and I'm sure the crew is not scrounging for food like Bear. Still, Bear really jumps into crocodile and leech infested swamps, really boulders that steep rock-face, and really does all the things impossible to fake. There are also times when Bear is clearly nervous, like when a good sized shark was circling his small raft in the pacific.

This might sound cruel of me; but I enjoy watching this show from the safety of my own home; watching Bear Grylls have to ring water out of his own socks; or walk through is water; or futilely try to start a fire in the rainforest; makes me feel cozy.

People don't seem to realize how big this world is, this is only occasionally demonstrated in the media; when a rich adventure's plane went down, the largest single man-hunt in history couldn't find him; and that was in America! This show gives a clear sense of the scale of our planet, and how little of it we actually occupy.

I like this show because it's only star - Bear Grylls- is a clearly confident, competent, and strong individual. It also perfectly demonstrates, implicitly, the importance of technology in our lives, by showing what life is when a person is (mostly) detached from it.",1211414400,28,3623,4.632398753894081
3302350,1,B0011TGKD0,"I write this review because it is important for viewers to understand that a great deal of the ""survival"" advice doled out on this show is not only false but can endanger people if they take it seriously. The makers and distributers of this program are irresponsible and reckless.

Parents, this is mainly a warning for you.

Some of the host's ""techniques"" are baloney, and many of the ""survival choices"" he makes are extremely inadvisable and should not be followed by the average person (or even the intermediate wilderness adventurer).

Most people know by now that the show is faked. The fact that it is faked is of secondary concern to me. (The host sometimes stays in hotels when supposedly sleeping in the wild. Several scenes are obvious set-ups with props, pre-hunted animals, and domesticated animals among other tricks. The crew does a great deal of the work for the host.)

Why is this? Why does he pretend to do these things when he is really faking them? For entertainment certainly, but more importantly because a lot of what he does is extremely stupid. So stupid and far-fetched that not even Grylls himself would do it because he might actually kill himself.

If you want to get your yuks watching a guy eat disgusting things that his crew has found for him (or that his bladder has produced), there's nothing wrong with that. The problem is when people take this joker seriously. If average viewers were to follow his advice if they ever were put in a real survival situation, they would reduce their chances of living and likely kill themselves.

So, parents, either don't let the kids watch this show, or make sure that they understand that it is ""make believe."" They need to know that it is fake and should never be copied, even if they find themselves in a survival situation.

There are better books and programs out there with reasonable and realistic survival advice ( e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survivorman/dp/B000O7862S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survivorman</a>).",1205366400,15,2046,5.126126126126126

With that aside, I bought this 6-DVD set from amazon with hopes of it being of high quality. I was sorely mistaken. These are DVD-R transfers from an outside company.
The downsides to this set include:
There are no interactive menus
The letterbox presentation bars at the top are unsteady and shake.
The actual shows are not of DVD quality
On the second disk of part one, it wouldn't return back to the menu after the episode was over, it just returned to the middle of the episode.

I returned this item to amazon and they were very friendly about the entire ordeal. Their customer service has never steered me wrong.

The actual Discovery channel box set of Man vs. Wild season 1 has fixed all of the above mentioned problems because they are the actual DVDs. So in short--if you want a good copy of a great show buy the Discovery Channel DVD's.",1203811200,84,1076,4.541237113402062

3302353,4,B0011TGKD0,"Over all a very entertaining program, but be forewarned that this DVD release reflects the recent re-editing of the episodes.  The original concept of the show has been changed from ""finding your way back to civilization,"" to an on location demonstration of survival technique.  While the original concept was more fun to watch, it had been criticized because various situations were staged without informing the audience.  The re-edited episodes explain when and where Bear receives outside help.  The new concept is more honest, but leaves on the editing room floor scenes that were more staged for their own good, such as the wild horses and bunny kill from the Sierra Nevada episode.

The Hawaiian, the MOAB and the pilot episodes are also missing from this set, as they have been highly criticized for their authenticity.

Also please be aware that this DVD set is presented as non-anamorphic video.

I have read some individuals reporting online that he is a fake.  Bear Grylls has a safety crew, a producer, and experts in certain fields watching out for him.  It doesn't mean he is a fake, to the contrary he is careful and operates at a skill level only a few on the planet can claim comfort with.  He isn't a fake.  He is disciplined.  As a family we enjoy Man vs Wild and if you are teachable, you can learn a lot from it.  My grandson has many Bear Grylls clothing from Craghoppers and it is well worth the money.",1364169600,,638,4.088709677419355

3302409,1,B0011TGKD0,"When I ordered this DVD for a Christmas gift, I found out that the DVD would not play on a Blue Ray player. When I contacted the Discovery Channel store in regards to the defective DVD, they continued to state that it was not returnable or exchangeable due to it being an opened DVD (though we did not know of the problem until we tried to watch the season),as well as a DVD apparently not suited for a blue ray player. Those of us that have a blue ray know that blue ray or not, it should still play,  therefore this should not have been an issue. Regardless I checked upon their recommendation to find a Blue Ray DVD in the season one and there was no such thing! Even after telling them, I would pay the difference if they could get me a Blue Ray season one, I would keep the old one if they could send a new one that did work, I would pay for an original one if they could let me know it was viewable... and anything else I could say to get across that I just want a DVD that will play in my DVD player... it was all useless! In the end, I still have the defective DVD that will not play... along with a very bad taste for the Discovery Channel. As an educator and it being my very first personal experience ordering from the Discovery Store, I highly recommend NOT ordering from their store due to the very poor customer service this would be both professionally for the classroom and personally for your own entertainment.",1265414400,,1428,4.211678832116788

3302413,5,B0011TGKD0,"Despite what anyone says about either Survivorman or Man Vs Wild, both have different qualities, both are great shows that I love. They have both changed throughout the seasons. You can't say that Man vs Wild is fake. Maybe they put him in staged things here and there to show you how to survive, but that's half the point of the show, to inform the viewer. But he is really jumping off waterfalls, eating bugs, getting sick, taking risks. To think that either of them are really alone in the wilderness is dumb. If there were a real emergency in either case, (even with survivorman, where most people like the fact that he is ""alone"") you can bet the producers of the show would be sending in the lifelines, while the camera men jumped in and helped. If they didn't, and something happened to either of the shows stars, it would be their butts on the line. The reality of it is, they are both t.v. shows! However much you want to believe is real or not, depends on your personal opinion. Survivor man is a good show. Man vs. Wild is a good show. Bear Grills is a good guy with high spirits that takes real risks while teaching you things that could literally save your life. What's not to like? Either way, it's entertaining.",1232841600,,1226,4.429203539823009

3302416,1,B0011TGKD0,"Bear Grylls has a somewhat entertaining show but it is completely worthless from a survival standpoint. I do not like the Title ""Man vs. Wild""? There are enough people going against the natural world already. That title gives nature a bad name, like it is something you must fight against.  The man has admitted to staging scenes of the show and staying in hotel rooms, to me, that discredits almost anything he has to say about natural living. If you are only interested in entertainment, then this show deserves about three stars. However, if you are interested in learning survival information, or not interested in seeing a fool run around in the woods, I would highly recommend Survivor Man. Also, any of Tom Brown's field guides are great for a person who is truly interested in survival and not just cheap entertainment.",1230163200,9,827,4.823943661971831

The locations are incredibly beautiful and Bear Grylls (survivalist) gets dropped off in some of the most remote and incredibly scenic places around the world, some are extremely rugged, wild, and inhospitable places where only nature survives.  Bear Grylls  explains the usefulness of the survival technique and is actually experiencing it as he makes his way back to civilization.
