2517438,4,B000EETMEW,"While not ranking up there with the 'classic' Charlie Brown titles, this 1972 special is still very enjoyable.
One name, ""Joe Cool"", will probably jog some memories.  Those who grew up in 1972 will remember the Snoopy as Joe Cool collectables.  Well he makes his TV premier here.

This is Charles Schulz's satire on politics with Lucy running the campaign, menacing voters to vote for her brother Linus, getting Linus to make empty campaign promises.  Remember, this was the year of Richard Nixon.

This originally aired as ""You're Elected, Charlie Brown"", and right after its broadcast the producers realized the folly of the title and quickly inserted ""Not"" for all re-broadcasts.  The theme song lyrics do not have the ""Not"" in them.  Unfortunately this edit must have been done to the master negative as this 'remastered' version has the revised title. But you can get a glimpse of the original title in the bonus material.

The second offering is 2006's ""He's A Bully, Charlie Brown"".  While I generally don't like the later Peanuts Specials, this one has the spirit and feel of the earlier shows.  I find it very enjoyable and forgot just how new it is.  At summer camp, a marble hustler plays all of the beginner kids and wins their marbles.  With the coaching of Snoopy, Charlie Brown comes to the rescue.  Memorable moments are with Marci teasing Peppermint Patty on the phone by pretending ""Chuck"" is romancing her.

There is also a 10 minute ""Making Of' documentary"" It is interesting tosee the voice actors as they are today.  The background material about the story line is informative.  Some material seems to be repeated from other Peanuts DVDs.

The sad thing is how little is included here!  A single DVD should hold 6 to 8 half hour shows.  But here we get only 2!  THIS DVD RUNS ONLY AN HOUR even with the bonus material.  1969's ""It Was A Short Summer, Charlie Brown"" would have been a good follow-up to the Summer Camp story.  And the school themed ""Play It Again, Charlie Brown"" from 1971 would have been a good companion to the school election show.  And how about the missing school science project episode from 1974 ""Its A Mystery Charlie Brown"".  Well, you get my point, the shows are there to fill out a DVD.",1223769600,11,2235,4.701030927835052

2517450,5,B000EETMEW,Great classic. Great to watch in between Labor Day and Halloween - as the context for the Peanuts kids is after school has started but before Halloween. And you'll see why..there's a great mention of the Great Pumpkin by Linus!,1354147200,,227,4.7
2517451,4,B000EETMEW,"I am so glad Amazon has other sellers that sell movies because I could not find this particular Charlie Brown title anywhere else for under $15, which in my opinion, is way too much for what you get here. I refuse to pay more than $10 for a Peanuts DVD. Luckily, this one was only $3.50 from the seller I used, then was $3.00 for shipping, which wasn't too bad. It came in a reasonable amount of time, and I am glad I can now add it to my collection. This is a great one to watch around Election Day and you also get a good bonus episode as well. Now, if I could only find He's Your Dog Charlie Brown this cheap.",1350086400,,612,3.983739837398374

2517456,5,B000EETMEW,"You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown is twenty-five minutes and originally air on October 29, 1972. This was the second special that came out in the 1970 decade and the eighth Peanut's special overall. Charlie Brown is regulated to supporting actor and Linus is the lead actor in this special. You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown begins with Sally coming home from school and throwing her books on the ground claiming that she is never going back to school again. When big brother asks what is wrong Sally says she cannot open her locker, mainly due to the fact she can't reach the combination lock. At school the next day Sally shows off Charlie in class as a show and tell project. When Charlie Brown leaves the classroom he sees a sign on the board the reads Student Body Election. At first Linus tries to convince Charlie Brown to run for president, but he does not want to know that nobody will vote for him. Linus brings the idea to Lucy and she polls the students and comes back with a survey that 98% would not vote Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown suggests that Linus should run for Student Body President. Lucy takes a survey and comes back that 98% would vote for Linus; must of the yes votes comes at Lucy threaten some of the students. Linus campaigns for president; doing debates, going on radio talk show, and getting his opinion in the school newspaper. During one debate Linus brings up the Great Pumpkin which costs him votes. During the election the vote is tied and the deciding vote is the opposition candidate who casts his vote for Linus. Sally takes Linus to the principal's office to so he can sock it to the big guy. In the end Linus caves in to the principal and Sally accuses him of selling out. The last scene is Sally kicking her locker and after she leaves the locker opens. You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown is almost like a lesson in running for office in a child's point view. I myself can relate to this special having worked on a political candidate campaign. You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown gets an AA++",1266969600,,2033,4.557377049180328
2517457,5,B000EETMEW,"Irregardless to the reproduction of the analog-to-digital technology, Charles Schulz and family have produced one of the best written cartoons in the lifespan of America. I can count on my one hand the names of cartoonists whose work is embedded in my video/dvd/tape collection.

My only gripe is not of the Schulz's library, but of the reproduction team who dispenses redigitized episodes on dvd with only two or three 24 minute shows on a disc! AND the fee for such is over the top charge.

Again, it is American. It is classic style, too.",1236124800,2,541,4.74468085106383
2517458,4,B000EETMEW,"With all the vitriol, empty rhetoric, name-calling, and mudslinging of another political season just behind us and another round soon to start, it's nice just to sit back and look at politics from the perspective of Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang.  YOU'RE NOT ELECTED, CHARLIE BROWN was a Peanuts special that first aired on television in 1972.  The special follows Linus van Pelt as he runs for president of the student council.  He's assisted in his campaign largely by Lucy and Charlie Brown (Charlie might not have a chance of winning an election, but he makes an amazing Assistant Campaign Manager).  The special includes segments with Lucy polling the student body to see if Linus has a chance of winning, Snoopy and Woodstock painting signs, Linus on a radio talk show hosted by Lucy, and Linus delivering a speech to the student body. This special isn't as well known as the holiday Peanuts shows, but it's still a gem and includes the first televised appearance of Snoopy as Joe Cool.

This DVD includes a making of featurette about the show.  It includes interviews with producer Lee Mendelson, director Bill Melendez, Schultz' wife Jeanne Schultz, and some of the actors who did the voices on the special.  The information on the special is quite informative.  For instance, I learned that the theme song for ""Joe Cool"" was not only written by Vince Guaraldi, but was sung and performed by him as well.  Also, the tv special rather closely follows the comic strip plot line it was based upon, but has a different ending.

The DVD also includes the 2006 special, ""He's a Bully, Charlie Brown.""  I haven't enjoyed the few newer television specials made since the death of Schultz in 2000.  However, this one has a better plot than some of the newer specials have had.  It also has Charlie Brown shown for once as a hero and coming to the defense of poor Rerun who is swindled by a marble hustler while at summer camp. Overall the entire tone of the piece feels like a tribute to Schultz legacy instead of just something to cash in on the cultural icons he created.

A great item for any fan of Peanuts. It's also something everyone can watch in order to take their mind of the elections and laugh at the absurdity that politics sometimes breeds.",1226188800,6,2258,4.6835443037974684
