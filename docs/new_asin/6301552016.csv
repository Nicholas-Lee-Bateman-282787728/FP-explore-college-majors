7812568,5,6301552016,"Once again we leap forward 100 years more, and Blackadder is now butler
to the feeble-minded Prince of Wales (a terrifically funny Hugh
Laurie), the son of the mad King George III.

This is the funniest of all the series, with Laurie's contribution
pushing the show up to a higher level.

There are still a few dull spots, and not every episode is brilliant,
but this does somehow combine almost Monty Python/Fawlty Towers type
genius into a period sit-com.

Atkinson as Blackadder continues to evolve, less dashing and handsome
here than in series 2, but more enjoyably (and understandably) angry
and frustrated at his situation in life, serving a man with a tiny
brain. There's also more physical humor in this season, and it's pulled
off very well indeed.",1347494400,,758,4.8604651162790695
7812569,5,6301552016,"Finally managed to get these back from someone we'd loaned them to. I'm not sure I'll loan them out again, as I'd hate to lose them. The highlight of this season is Hugh Laurie as the thickheaded Prince George, contrasting wonderfully with Black Adder's dry biting wit. If all you've seen of Rowan Atkinson is _Mr. Bean_, you're in for quite a surprise. This is the season that introduced me to one of my favorite TV shows, and is uniformly excellent. That having been said, I'd still recommend starting with season II (_not_ season I: it's almost an entirely different show).",1092268800,,576,4.712871287128713
7812570,4,6301552016,"The usual cast of character go through another round of historical hysterics.  Some fine comedy moments for the regular crowd of Black Adder adhearents.
For people who have never seen the series, it isn't the best choice to start with.  I'd go right back to the begining with Black Adder #1 and work my way forward.
Two notes concerning the episode Nob & Nobility.  Tim McKinnery of Lord Percy fame in series #1 & 2 and of Capt Darling fame in #4 plays the French nobleman.  If im not mistaken we also see Chris Barie of Reddwarf as the French rep.
This episode was not shown in the rotation in NE due to its poking fun at the french and the proximity of Quebec.",1008288000,,662,4.314516129032258
