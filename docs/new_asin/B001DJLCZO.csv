8293924,4,B001DJLCZO,"I picked up the ""Raw Feed Horror Collection"" from the DVD bargain rack at a Ross Store. Horror movies are not my thing, especially if they go into the supernatural in any way. Well, these are not horror stories in the conventional sense at all. These are a set of horrible things that might happen to any of us and are quite a good set of movies, albeit a bit unsettling. The movies are the ""direct to DVD"" type that have not been shown in movie theaters and I generally have associated low quality with that type of product. Well, these are cheap productions, there's no question about that, and most of them have the feeling that they were slapped together on a very low budget in a matter of weeks, but they're amazingly good movies, considering. All of the movies tend to have a wide range of viewer ratings, and the ratings tend to run low. However, if you're willing to watch and put up with the less glossy nature of the productions, all are rather scary, thought provoking and rather well done movies. I rated and reviewed each of the movies under it's separate title and this review is for the package as a whole.

""Rest Stop"" plays on anyone's fears who has traveled a lot by car and is forced to stop at a roadside rest (or camp, or eating place) and is faced with creepy and threatening characters. It's rather overdone, but you'll be thinking about it the next time you make a rest stop. I rated it as three stars. ""Believers"" is a story based on the ""Heaven's Gate"" cult of about a decade ago. It's a good movie except for a couple flaws in the story, including the ending. I rated it four stars. ""Sublime"" is an interesting and chilling examination of the American health care system from the point of view of someone who goes into the hospital for a seemingly simple procedure. I gave it five stars. It's difficult watching, but well worth the effort.

This is an interesting set of movies. The ""Horror"" label is inappropriate. They may be horrible all right, but everything is within things that can happen in your daily life.
