2525417,5,B000EOTU0S,Hopefully this is a dubbed version of the Japanese series and not the censored version of the series that we got here in the states. It would be terrible if we got the edited series after all this time of waiting.,1144281600,,213,4.219512195121951

8112034,5,B000EOTU0S,Teknoman is great and this is not the UPN dub but the international dub!,1441670400,,72,4.214285714285714
8112035,4,B000EOTU0S,"As for the show, I didn't grow up with this, but it's pretty cool - especially if you like the 80's giant robot sci-fi stuff.

This is the American release of Teknoman - not the Japanese Tekkaman Blade version.  That means it's like Robotech and Voltron - all English dubbed and, (I believe), no subtitles and no original Japanese dialog.  I would be interested in the original Tekkaman Blade series as well.

I purchased this because I had originally purchased the complete series at the store.  I didn't get to watching the whole show until after I could return it - and I found errors.  Two discs in the entire set wouldn't read.  I looked it up online and found that the complete series release is notorious for having these problems.  So, I bought this individual volume to replace what I was missing, and that did the trick.  Apparently, the individual volumes are from a different batch.

I would recommend purchasing the individual volumes, whatever the cost, instead of the Complete Series set.",1365552000,,1003,4.745664739884393
8112036,5,B000EOTU0S,"This is the superior International English Dub of Tekkaman Blade, not the radically cut US English Dub.

Of the first 16 Japanese episodes, only one is missing, and it's a recap episode anyway. The majority of extreme content has been left unchanged, including character deaths.

The only point where this dub suffers is in the final four episodes, which have been merged into two, and one other episode towards the end that has been completely removed detailing Blade's past with his brother.

Other than that, the new voice cast and musical score are brilliant and much easier for English speakers to understand than Japanese.",1176163200,5,628,5.019230769230769
8112037,2,B000EOTU0S,"To be honest, I expected it to be like the episodes I saw on UPN in 1995. But this was a little different. The transformation narratives only happened once- first for Blade's original transformation in the pilot episode, and for when he used the teknobot in ""Snapshot"", and the opening credits weren't what I expected. I'd rather hold onto the memories than recommend something that other people might be disappointed with. Aside from those little things, it's okay.",1164585600,4,466,4.987179487179487
8112038,1,B000EOTU0S,"Yes, it's the name of the original series. Teknoman is a horribly edited version in the US. Don't waste your money in this piece of garbage and get the original version (Maybe on Ebay)...",1155427200,,187,4.529411764705882
8112039,5,B000EOTU0S,"This set may be the Edited Version that was aired in the UK/Austrailia, but I say to Purchase this set anyway! if you are a fan of the series in any form, then buy it to show Media Blasters there is a demand for the original Japanese version and a demand for this series to be released!  if sales don't do well with theses sets, it is less likely they will release the original Tekkaman Blade in its entirety.  14 episodes for $25 is not a bad deal! I have many versions of this series and I am proud to have this version as well! if they do release a full collection of the Original Uncut version of this series months after these 3 collections I will buy them too!

Don get Discouraged! show your support for such a fantastic series and buy this set!",1151452800,4,752,4.172413793103448
8112040,2,B000EOTU0S,"If it carries the name Teknoman you guys, it's the edited run down version of Tekkaman Blade.  I noticed one person posted and pretty much said the Japanese version was the lesser variation compared to Teknoman, that's like a person claiming Robotech came before Macross, and Macross is just a japanese rendition of Robotech's first season....sort of like saying Liberals are monkey flingers and Republics are kings or vice versa.

Teknoman went from a 49 episode series down to a 43 due to poor raitings and heavy subject matter.  Not too mention characters which died in the original series are claimed to of stayed alive.

Example, Balzak was killed by Tekkaman Sword, however in edited Teknoman Balzak survives his LONG LONG burning decent back to Earth after taking a stab wound to the chest.

Also the irish soldier from one of the first set of episodes and makes his appearance again in the second half of the series basically has a lance lodged into his Torso and is killed. In the Teknoman series the stab is edited out and he ""passes out"" due to the ""Flash Granade"" he chucks at Teknoman Lance.

If you want to be a die hard collector of the series go ahead and buy it, over a dozen episodes for 25 bucks isn't a terrible buy.

But we're told if we wait a bit longer (maybe another year) Media Blastors will more then likely have out a Japanese Uncut Tekkaman Blade box set.",1151280000,3,1384,4.578947368421052
8112041,2,B000EOTU0S,"Teknoman (aka Space Knight Tekkaman Blade, not to be confused with the previously available Tekkaman Blade II, which takes place 10 years after Teknoman/Tekkaman Blade) first appeared in the U.S. on a UPN Weekend Kid's Spot.  Thanks to Saban (yes, the same folks who did Power Rangers), it was cut up much as a paper doll to fit the standards of a children's program (as such, the manufacturer lists this a appropriate for 7+).  Although this show appeared alongside of early Dragon Ball Z episodes (which were also much editted at the time), it failed to attract the following DBZ had both in the U.S. as well as in it's native Japan (which was originally cancelled halfway through it's original run in the 1970's).

This DVD version is nearly identical to the televised version.  The only significant difference is in that the original Japanese opening (which featured a J-Pop tune which was far from outstanding) was reinstated over the Americanized version (which was the normal medly of scenes mixed with a series synopsis and catchy synthesizer music).

The downside to this edition is being subject to much rewriting which is not even of good quality in some parts.  The DVD itself, which is issued by Anime Works, features no special features and only english audio.  Basically, it is bare bones, not much else what I expect from Anime Works.  Furthermore, the sound quality is poor in some spots.  It does not even offer english subtitles.

The upside is that in one edition, 14 episodes are available at the cost of a standard DVD.  Considering that I am accustomed to getting 3 to 4 times less episodes on an average Anime DVD, this for me offsets the lack of features.  Hopefully an equal or close amount will be available on the two subsequent collections (available in July and September), which are apparently going to be roughly the same price.  I only wonder if they will issue the whole 49 episodes, as when it was shown on UPN it was not shown in its entirity (I do not remember just how much was actually shown).

If it came right down to it, Teknoman does not compare to Tekkaman Blade.  If you can not tolerate the misguided efforts of companies trying to expose the West to Anime, then Teknoman is not for you.  There was a fansub version of this years ago which one may be able to track down.  Admittedly, when I tracked down an old undubbed, uneditted version of Super Dimension Fortress Macross issued by Anime-ego, I swore I would never go back to Robotech.  If there is ever a version of Tekkaman Blade issued at least with English subtitles, this DVD is getting traded in PDQ.  But for now, I am grateful that I can revisit this show which I had recently begun to doubt I would ever see again.

My ratings:

The show itself (American cut version): 3.5 of 5

The DVD itself: 1 of 5",1149897600,3,2809,4.609657947686117
8112042,1,B000EOTU0S,"In the fall of 1995, a new show named Teknoman was released and dubbed for television.  Darker, more serious and intense then past dubbed fare like sailor moon, it immediately captured a cult audience.

Now eleven years later, that show is put onto DVD.  Unfortunately, it is no longer 1995.  Anime no longer  has a small but devoted cult following, but has a major fanbase.  A fanbase that tends to frown upon rewrites to a storyline, edited or even, gasp, episodes that are not at all included.  A fanbase that prefers to see the actual show as it aired in Japan, with subtitles, the original name, intro's and outro's, and storyline.  Sadly, this DVD is a throwback to a more primitive time when anime was often converted into something more American.  A time back when Space Fortress Yamato was re-named into Starblazers, because heaven forbid Americas children witness something like a WWII japanese warship being upgraded into a space fortress to save humanity.

In the past ten years, anime has become a much more widespread and respected medium.  Respected enough to win academy awards and be given prime time slots on television.  Teknoman was very much the Robotech of the nineties in that for what it was, a dubbed, edited, rewritten, and re-scored version of a very cool Japanese anime, it was actually very engrossing.  Sadly, over the past ten years I've managed to actually view Spaceknight: Tekkaman Blade, the Japanese show Teknoman was taken from, in it's entirety.  And I'm sad to say that this show does not measure up in any form.

The list of failings this series has are numerous.  Entire episodes are cut, Teknoman is 43 episodes to Tekkaman Blades 49.  This would not be so bad if they had not have cut out two of the series most important episodes.  Brothers of Light and Darkness, and The house where time stood still.  Not only that, but Teknoman also edited the final two episodes down and condensed them into one final episode.  Lessening what was a great ending story arc.  other minor episodes were cut, but that is not so much a loss as the cuts mentioned above.

The intro's were redone, using edited footage from certain episodes and generic synth pop musc.  This is incredibly tacky in comparison to the catchy j-pop intro's and interesting animation that comprised Tekkman Blades intro's and outtro's.

The episodes that stayed behind were rewritten in several ways.  Lessening the original series mature mood with generic and rather silly dialogue and story developments.  And perhaps worst of all was the renaming of some of the characters.  Tekkaman Blade was a dark, serious, engrossing show with likeable characters and some very heavy subject matter.  Somehow it's rather hard to take such subject matter as having to murder your beloved family and friends due to their being genetically controlled by aliens when they rename characters such as Noal and Aki into Ringo and Starr, and the main character Shinya, into Nick Carter.

DVD features are even skimpier, there are none.  No subtitles or japanese language track, just a admittedly decent dub.  No audio options, your stuck with mono, no stereo.  I know this show was dubbed in 1995, but it doesn't mean they have to treat the DVD release as such.

I enjoyed Teknoman eleven years ago, it is doubtful I would have become such a ardent fan of anime without it's influence.  But sadly, after having seen Spaceknight: Tekkaman Blade, Teknoman just does not measure up in any way to it's heritage.  Teknoman is an entirely different show from Tekkaman Blade, in the same way Robotech was an entirely different show from Super Dimensional Fortress Macross.  Though it took twenty years for them to do so, ADV finally managed to distribute the actual Macross storyline on DVD to the public.  I just hope it doesn't take another ten years for Spaceknight: Tekkaman Blade to get the same respect.",1148428800,5,3887,4.861491628614917
8112043,5,B000EOTU0S,This is the international edited dubbed series of teknoman and i don't know why people don't like it. i have seen both the japanees version  and this version and i think this teknoman version is better then it hands down.,1144281600,3,221,4.525
