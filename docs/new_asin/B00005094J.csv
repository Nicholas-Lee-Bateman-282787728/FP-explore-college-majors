1385161,4,B00005094J,"I had been waiting for the release of the second half of 3x3 eyes like FOREVER.  I love the story between Yakumo and Pai, the monsters, the sanjian... the first part of the series is very much worth owning.
The second half... well, the animation style changed, the characters changed and nothing came close enough to the manga for my tastes.  It's like they waited so long to get to the second half that they lost track of the story.  Plus, it honestly doesn't seem to end there, so the ending is depressingly vague.
Still, the soundtrack is pretty good, and you have to love cute little Yakumo.",983836800,,595,4.4907407407407405
1385162,5,B00005094J,"First of all, I own and have seen the old Streamline dub of 3x3 Eyes. So I'm speaking not of a long ago recollection of the old dub, but from an actual recent comparison of the old version vs. this new DVD. This new Pioneer DVD release is 1000 times better than that old crappy dub by Streamline.  Not only does this DVD have great voice ""acting"" (note the emphasis on the word ""acting"", something which the old dub lacked), but it finally completes the series that has  long been incomplete (thanks MGM/Orion for leaving us in the dark for 4 years). OK now before you say ""why am I so gaga over this new dub"", let me say that I still prefer watching the Japanese Language version with English subtitles (something that this great DVD version offers for the first time). But Pioneer gets an ""A"" for effort for putting serious work into making a good quality dub. A lot better than many dubs out there. I enjoyed it a lot, but who can resist Megumi Hayashibara as Pai.  Although Christian Campbell does a great Yakumo. What I don't like about this DVD is the image quality of the 1st OVA series.  But I blame that on the quality of the original source material and not the DVD authoring process.  Still it's much better than my Streamline VHS.  The extras are somewhat lacking (just some image gallery and cast bios) still I give Pioneer kudos for including a voice cast images & bios for both the English and Japanese actors, something you don't often see in an anime DVD. One important note comparing the old Streamline version to this new DVD, which makes this DVD version better. You can see that Streamline actually did some editing to 3x3 show when they made their VHS ""perfect collection"" in 1992.  You don't get to see the images of Kayanwang's grave and the ruins of Kunlun which run during the end-credits of episode #1.  And at the start of episode #2 & #4, Streamline decided to edit in their own music into the show rather than using just the voice over and sound effects.  Plus it's nice to hear all 4 of the end title music scores from the first OVA.  Speaking of the music, did anybody notice that the movie Braveheart practically stole Pai's theme from 3x3 Eyes as their own love theme?  Kaoru Wada should be suing James Horner for theft. I have seen many anime sites list this DVD to their essential collection list and I am one to agree with them.  It's well worth the extra money to own this classic.",983836800,20,2419,4.435665914221219
1385163,4,B00005094J,"I first watched this anime many years ago as a dub.  And despite the many criticisms it recieved for the actors and actresses participating in the english dubbing, I thought they were pretty good.  Yakumo's original english voice did a really good job and so did several others.  This dvd dub doesn't have the same enthusiasm and same feel as the original dubbing, though Yakumo's english voice displayed great voice acting.  I guess I didn't like this dubbing so much because I was so used to the original dubbing of the film and much of the dialogue was changed.
Anyways, on to my review...The video quality is not of the usual dvd quality seen in more recent dvd anime, due to the age of the film.  However, the second disc, since it is newer, has better animation and artwork.
The story is pretty good and is one of my favorite anime of all time.  However, the story seems unresolved in this dvd set and hopefully there will be future plans in continuing the story (I've heard rumors of a tv series of 3x3 eyes).  The romance within the story is also well done.  All in all, this anime classic should be watched by all anime fans.  Despite all of the obstacles it had on its way to America, 3x3 eyes finally made its way here and hopefully many will come to appreciate this.",983059200,3,1278,4.450643776824034
1385164,5,B00005094J,"3x3 eyes is one of the longest running and best Anime Manga in Japan.  The 2 OAV series of course are 2 of the most classic Anime series ever made.  If you are a true anime fan, then this collector's set is a must get.
If there is a set that would make me not buy El Hazard: The Magnificent World.  This one would be one.
Even if you are not an hardcore Anime fan, the action, the emotion and the character in the show is still one of the best even at current time.",982627200,2,465,3.873684210526316
1385165,4,B00005094J,"3x3 has to be one of the virtually unknown classics of anime-and this DVD set has to be the best deal for a fan there is. Previously only the first 4 parts of the 7 were release on VHS, leaving 5&6 hard to find-while 7 never actually came out for the public (at least in America, I could be wrong else where.)
The mini-series begins the saga of Yakumo, and his quest to make Pai, his demon-acquaintance, human. A strange bond develops between the two of them, binding them together through thick and thin. Their journey takes them to Hong Kong and back to Japan, where they finally become separated-how they get back together is a story in its own.
The animation is great is some places, and lacking in others-but the strange plot and crazy characters make up for it. The music might seem a tad familiar to any one who has seen Braveheart-you might even swear that the producers of Braveheart borrowed it from the anime :)  3x3 Eyes is, however, extremely gory, which is critical to plot. But the gore is well done, and a vital part of enjoying the anime, in my humble opinion. ;) The series is truly superb for any otaku or anime-fan, but perhaps a little too much for someone just getting started on their anime fix.",977875200,36,1218,4.4375

Well the company that  previously released the series stopped one tape shy of finishing it.  The  animation, plot and characters are like a breath of fresh air.  You'll  see!  I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!",968803200,4,333,4.344262295081967
1385176,3,B00005094J,"3x3 Eyes is driven by a very strong and original plot, but the overall atmosphere is just too gloomy for my taste. Even daytime scenes come off as dark and brooding, somewhat reminiscent of Batman films.

The main character Pai is a sweet young girl who wants nothing else but to become a full-fledged human being. She doesn't even know that like the Incredible Hulk, she's just scary when she's angry. A third eye appears on her forehead, and the incredible powers of the Sanjiyan become manifest. In her Sanjiyan form, Pai is merciless -- the total opposite of her usual self. Helping Pai on her quest for humanity is Yakumo, an ordinary guy with a not-so-ordinary job (which involves cross-dressing). A romance between Pai and Yakumo develops in a realistic and believable pace, and the innocence of the two characters is a great contrast with the violent setting, giving 3x3 Eyes a certain freshness and distinctive twist.

3x3 Eyes is one hell of a blood and gore fest, and the scenes are shown in their full, horrific glory. There are also a lot of occult elements like demons, evil spirits, and possession. What ruined this series for me is the artwork. None of the characters look any good. Faces are drawn in a pudgy manner that's just annoying to look at... which is a far cry from creator Yuzo Takada's original artwork. The English dubbing is quite satisfactory though, and I didn't notice anything amiss.

3x3 Eyes could've been a great series. In fact, there are a lot of things it could've been -- if only the visuals were better.",1158796800,3,1545,4.693726937269373
1385177,4,B00005094J,"A fantasy horror anime that will touch your heart!!!!

Not only that! there is also love, a little comedy, BLOOD and GORE, adventure, suspense, dark settings and ACTION!

Note: The first four episodes are kind of ""low budget"" but there are gory and action-packed! The last three episodes are POWERFULLY  HIGH BUDGET but there are kind of childist and the blood and gore were tuned down a little.

About the dub:

I preffer the original dub! this one is not so powerfully emotional as the original and the voices were not THAT great. I think that the acting and dialoge were better but the emotions and voices were not SOO great!!

Pai voice could be a LOT better!!! So I preffer to heart it in japanese.

1385178,4,B00005094J,"I've got the original VHS of the first part of the story, and what's there I love.

Problem is what's NOT there.  Any resolution at all.  I understand the thematic reasons for doing this, they were planning on more to follow.  Yet apart from one more series with the same ambiguous ending nothing HAS followed.

That's the biggest flaw here, they were banking on a continuation that never appeared.  It's like DaVinci's unfinished paintings, 3x3 Eyes may be beautiful, but it's not completed and so not worth nearly as much.

If ya don't mind having no ending to a story you get involved in, check it out.  The disjointed parts ARE very good, but that doesn't detract from the fact that they are disjointed.

You may really want to rethink buying this if you were doing so hoping it resolved anything.  They've been quiet on this for so long it's doubtful we'll ever get a complete story.  I'd just go buy the manga series, or just get Visions of Escaflowne.  They actually bothered to FINISH Visions.",1133740800,5,1001,4.625

1385180,5,B00005094J,"This anime is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. At first the cell animation bothered me.  It seemed to flow a bit choppy and Yakumo's expressions were a bit wierd. But it grows on you and becomes unique in its own way.  Besides, from the 5th episode onward the animation has been improved (episodes 1-4 were done in an earlier year, 5-7 were done later). It's an older show so many people would not appreciate it, but they would be making a grievious mistake in passing it by.  The other reviews pretty much sum up the story but I would like to add a few comments.  If you don't like spoilers, don't read on. This anime is a perfect blend of horror and romance.  Pai saves Yakumo when he is on the verge of death.  The only way she can do it is by taking his soul and making him her immortal body guard.  When I say immortal, I mean immortal!  Yakumo can been cut in two, riddled by bullets, skewered, dismembered, etc. and still pull himself together. In order to get his soul back he has to help Pai fulfill her mission.  There fates are tied together, either become human together or die. This show isn't for children.  Yakumo is sort of like a living zombie and the creator made sure he at least had 3 or 4 gory ""death"" scenes per episode.  Who knew someone could bleed so much.  AT first it might shock you, but then you start to enjoy it and think ""Oh my gosh, how did I become so blood thirsty.""  There is also a scene of virgin sacrifice and some demonic dolls that would give children nigtmares, but are perfectly fine for an adult.  As horror's go, this one is mild. The romance is surprising.  There is a depth to it you wouldn't think it had.  Yakumo grows in love with the loveable Pai.  She is really silly and has an optimistic outlook on just about everything.  Her demonic personality(the Sanjion) however, torments Yakumo.  She insults his lack of skill and calls him a slave.  Still it is obvious that she too cares for him.  Most of her insults cover her true feelings.  Later in the series, a third party, Awashoe enters Pai's body.  This is where it gets more complicated and the trajedy occurs.  Awashoe is like the perfect blend between Pai and the Sanjion.  She falls desperatley in love with Yakumo and vice versa.  By this time Yakumo is very confused.  Who is the real girl?  Who does he really love?  In the last episode one of the three souls has to make a huge sacrifice in order to save the one THEY ALL love.  What happens then is bitter sweet.  Most people's complaint is that the series ends with no real conclusion.  Humanity has not been achieved.  But there was no time for something so momentous to occur in just 7 episodes.  Besides, it could take centuries for them to succeed.  I admit that I would have loved to have seen this develope into a bigger series, but I love it just the way it is.  By ending it after such a passionate scene we are left in awe and tears.  But most importantly, by leaving off at that point, the creator leaves it up to our imagination to come up with the rest of the story.  That way everyone gets what they want, instead of later being dissapointed.",1124236800,,3109,4.342608695652174
1385181,4,B00005094J,"This anime appears at first to be a typical horror genre film, but reveals itself over time to be a remarkably good story. Don't let reviews from people who fail to follow the story through mislead you, there is a cohesive and well-written story here. Imagery can be very violent and bloody, be forewarned. Classic storytelling themes are well played here - the heroes are determined to move forward to meet their fates, victories come with their price, the ""heavies"" are truly frightening yet the true battle occurs (as with any good story) within the characters themselves. Imagery is well done but dated, editing is excellent, the english voice acting and translation is awful (I ordinarily prefer the english translations but in this case suggest watching these DVDs subtitled, as the translations of the subtitles carry the story far better than the english dub.) Overall I would say that this is a relatively unknown series to english-speaking audiences and that it shouldn't be so. Fans of anime classics like Akira, Armitage etc will enjoy this, as will fans of American supernatural-themed stories (Buffy, etc.) I'm comfortable saying that the people who take a chance and purchase this series will probably be glad they did so.",1116201600,7,1237,5.0390243902439025
1385182,3,B00005094J,"This fantasy, horror anime is average. Due to its lack of plot. Cute girl with strange powers. An immortal servant who protects her. Demons and fighting and loads of action. Even a slice of comedy. This should be a classic, right? Wrong.

Those of you that said CLASSIC. Not Really, yet we're not drenched bad either. They retold the story of the manga. Well, didn't really retell...they just animated what they thought were the best parts of the manga. The plot often jumps and then says bye, bye! If your planning on purchasing this DVD, I'd recommend reading the manga first.

That being said, this is STILL good anime we have here. While the original episodes of this title are over a decade old. The main disappointment of 3x3 Eyes was the disjunctive nature of the plot, but the ending was anti-climactic and very disappointing, but a good excuse for a second OAV series to occur. The setting was hard to distinguish. (Am I in Japan, Hong Kong, or California?

3x3 Eyes would probably have been better served as a television series, instead of 4 episodes that are 30 min long.

Gory, action-packed anime that could've used more of the plot that the manga originally had. Not recommended, but if you read the manga...go right ahead.",1102809600,3,1237,4.712962962962963
1385183,5,B00005094J,"The two-disc Collector's Edition unites two linked stories, although the appearance of the characters and the style of direction change between them. Pai is the last Sanjiyan or holy demon: the rest were exterminated 300 years ago when their king, Kaiyanwang, turned to evil. She's spent the last three centuries trying to become human. In Japan, Pai meets Yakumo Fujii, whose scientist father discovered that transforming a Sanjiyan into a human requires the ""Statue of Humanity."" The evil creatures who hope to resurrect Kaiyanwang also want the Statue: Pai and Yakumo challenge them in a series of bloody battles. Pai turns Yakumo into a Wu, a spirit whose soul is bound to her own and who cannot be killed while she lives. Yakumo falls in love with her, although it's difficult to understand why. Immortals ends when Pai and Benares, Kaiyanwang's chief henchman, disappear in a violent explosion. Realizing that Pai must still be alive, Yakumo vows to search until he finds her again.

Divine Demon picks up the story four years later: Pa-Bo Ayanokoji believes she's a typical high school girl who likes to hang out with her friends. Her world is shattered when Yakumo reveals she is not a human, but Pai. Kaiyanwang is about to rise again, and his servants are trying to kill Pai, who can challenge his power. Pai's memories of her life in the blessed realm of Kunlun have been blocked by a spell; Yakumo takes her to Tibet to break it. Along the way, he fights assorted villains led by the sniggering Choukai. Pai and Yakumo cross the barrier to Kunlun with the aid of treasure hunter Jake Macdonald. There they battle both Choukai and Benares. Both stories end on weak notes, with enough plot strings left hanging to form a fringe. In Immortals, the viewer never learns what becomes of the sinister Mrs. Wong, the Statue of Humanity, or Yakumo's group of friends. In Divine Demon the expected confrontation between Pai and Kaiyanwang fails to materialize. Contains these episodes: 1. ""Transmigration,"" 2. ""Yakumo,"" 3. ""Sacrifice,"" 4. ""Straying,"" 5. ""Descent,"" 6. ""The Key,"" 7. ""The Return."" Rated 16+: considerable violence, minor profanity, and nudity.",1095897600,3,2160,4.983379501385041

The storyline is great; good character development, especially from the first dvd to the 2nd dvd (perfect collection). The drawings are one of the best out there- again, since it's from the 80s, this means it's an older style, but is a better quality. More hand-drawn stuff than computerized.

The perfect collection does not go into as much depth as the manga (there are at least 35 graphic novels that I know of) so you may think the storyline sucks, if you don't know about the graphic novels.

The animation is fine. The japanese version is okay to my recollection. The English Dub is horrible though. I have never heard such terrible voice acting. Who did the laughs for these characters?
The dubbing obviously doesn't do the series justice. I also think it is relatively boring throughout most. Once it gets near the end things start to pick up. Watch the Japanese version though.

1385186,5,B00005094J,"I was never into anime until 3x3 Eyes came along. I'm still not that big of a fan of anime though I do admit there are some top quality anime out there.

But for me 3x3 Eyes is different. I was just watching it on one of the national tv networks when I came across it and at first I dismissed it as anime nonsense but I was hooked after watching the cliffhanger ending of the sixth part ( or the fourth part in the edited Manga UK version I was watching).

I stayed up late to watch the final part (15 at the time, had school the next morning) and I'm so glad I did. I loved the animation and art deign for starters but it was the characters personality I fell in love with in the epic saga. It was the last 20 minutes or so at the end where the true meaning of the film came to light and it was those last minutes which made the film truly great. Yakamo (the main male character, good guy) would do anything for the girl (Pai) he loved and he took the most brutal of punishments at the hands of Beneras (main bad guy) but not before telling her something....I won't give too much away...

The whole point the director of this masterpiece was making is told in the last part of the film and it just gobsmacks you. Nearly five hours later and this was what the film was really about! It wasn't simply about action, blood 'n' guts, humour, or demons etc. It was simply about.......ahhh now that would be telling!  It has to be seen from start to finish to really understand the emotions it brings about. And the music is well worth owning. Definately one of the best soundtracks ever. (I'm sure the composer of Bravehart will agree:-)

So those of you who like action films with a good dose of human emotion thrown into it, buy it now! You won't regret it....

Remember this is a newly dubbed version but I recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles on. The new Pioneer dubbing is good and more proffesional than the older Streamline dubbed edition but the voices were better in the older Streamline dubbed addition.

1385192,4,B00005094J,"3x3 Eyes was one of those not so 'normal relationship stories between a boy and a girl' from the early 90's.  The set is a compilation of all 3x3 Eyes anime to date.  This is definitely a region 1 DVD so those out of the US stuck with a non-region 1 DVD are out of luck.
Immortals is the first half of the story, and is about Pai's (the triclops) quest to becoming human, but she needs the help from a boy called Yakumo; who she has been looking for, for four years; and an ancient statue.  I just so happens that an evil cult is also in search of this statue at the same time.  The main characters are loveable.  Yakumo is a silly character, but means well.  He is also a hopeless hero does his damnedest to protect Pai in times of danger.  Pai is a dual personality character.  Most times cute and innocent, but the triclops character the opposite, but rational.  The art from Immortals is dated, and perhaps slightly inconsistant.  It was made at a time just before the use of bright and bold colours which is common in current day anime.  The story it self has a good mix of action, monsters, comedy and drama.
The Legend of the Divine Demon is the second part of the series, and takes place some four years after the end of the first part.  First of all, the style of art is noticeably different to the Immortals, but it does not alter the fact that it is a continuation of the original story.  This time the story starts with Yakumo in search for Pai.  When Yakumo does find her, Pai does not remember him, or the events from four years back.  The original plot from Immortals takes a back seat in this installment of the story, which is basically about regaining Pai's memory, which in turn uncovers some other, perhaps unnecessary, convolutions in story.  I would suggest people start the second disc with no expectations for it to be like the first disc. This part is certainly less comical, the characters are less likeable, but the action remains about the same.  Yakumo is much more confident in fighting, although his adversaries have also gotten stronger.
Over all it is a good story to watch, there are strong themes of devotion and friendship, so it's not the regular mindless action  for no-reason story.",991785600,12,2221,4.455445544554456

7928810,5,B00005094J,This anime is quite awesome to watch.  It was one of the first shows I watched and it forever impacted my anime 'upbringin' :D,1269388800,,126,4.25
7928811,5,B00005094J,"I only have the VHS from Streamline/Orion Video. That story is the Immortals,the 1st half of the collection. One must remember how old this story is(the first 1/2 is 17 years old)so the ""Anime"" is what you should expect from that era.
 As for myself...It is the most enjoyable anime that I have. I am sure that numerous people would disagree with me. When I first started to watch it I just went...crap this is going to suck...yet after about 15 minutes I was drawn in and it did not let up from there on out. I am not a huge fan of anime but after coming across & watching 3x3 Eyes(which had sat in my closet for many,many years)I have recently gotten back into it. In my opinion it is far better than Akira. I have ordered the Collectors Edition and am looking forward to it.
 There is on thing that I wonder about....if the other two disc's that are sold seperately are the same story what makes this so expensive? I have read nothing about massive extras that come with the Collectors Edition. Is it all about the dubbing? Does anyone know?",1220659200,,1044,4.376288659793815

7928813,5,B00005094J,"3 x 3 eyes may not have the slick sleek computer anime that has drawn many people to the genre, and they haven't re-released it digitized and re-done, which I think is just as well. While it is all drawn old school hand work, it's amazing the amount of expression that can be conveyed, even in just a simple screen still.

I originally caught the last half of the series on cable many years ago and have searched for it for some time. I'd not even seen the first part until I found a fan sub on the web, and decided the heck with it, I would sink the money to get it.  I'm disabled and don't have much money, so this was actually a considerable investment for me.

There are plot holes and such, and i gather the manga was more complete and cleared all that, but the overall essense of the story can be easily followed, and as I said, it may be old school style animation, but some of the expression drawn into the art is more than worth it.

Very creative, and an intersting weaves of oountries, religions, and belief systems hooked into modern day era.

I will agree it's definitely not a series for younger kids to see, not so much for sex or nudity, but it's pretty gory. Yakumo gets dismembered, maimed, or barfs up enough blood for three people about every episode, but if you aren't particularly squeamish (which I'm not) the storyline, the hand art and series will hook you and draw you in, if you have appreciation for such things.",1179532800,,1440,4.338289962825279
7928814,5,B00005094J,"Okay, so part one of the show doesn't have a conclusion. And part two only has half a conclusion. This collection, I am told, is not the real end of the series. Apparently, there are more episodes that just never made it to an american release.

However, thaaat doesn't matter even a little bit to me. This show is grreat *like kellog's corn flakes* and while I've only seen it dubbed (totalllly cheesy voice acting, especially laughter + screaming) it's one of my favorites. (Maybe I just like Yuzo Takada's work.)

As for violence, humans don't have as much blood as these character's seem to and I didn't notice any gloomy tones (as mentioned in other reviews.) I tend to focus of the romance, I guess. I mean, there's some angst n stuff, but what show about teenagers doesn't have angst?

p.s. I love the soundtrack, too.",1166313600,,825,4.598639455782313
