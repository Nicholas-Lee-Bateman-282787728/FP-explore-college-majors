1756375,4,B00006HAX7,"I saw this movie during  the spring of last year, during its theatrical run. This show had its hilarious moments, but was one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen.  The characters are believable, but I live among a lot of deerhunters and the deer season is a like a religious experience for many of them.  People really do talk like that in the UP and you will either love the movie or hate it.  I heard people leaving the theater saying ""That was the most disgusting movie I have seen"", as well as ""That was pretty good.""  The characters were amazing in their portrayal of deerhunters. It is not for the squeamish of stomach, but portrays a culture that does exist.  This movie is targeted to a limited group of people, so it is surprising they actually are releasing it on DVD.",1032566400,3,786,4.386206896551724
1756376,5,B00006HAX7,"Whatta gas.....Jeff and crew bring us right into their deer camp and make us feel as though we're right there with 'em. I'm sure you know the plot, so I won't rehash it... This is a wonderfully refreshing, funny film and I'm ... proud that Jeff hasn't dismissed his Mid-Michigan roots. ... I'll be picking up this DVD as soon as it's out and giving Jeff my congrats. ...",1032393600,,370,4.3768115942028984
1756377,1,B00006HAX7,"I was extremely excited to see this movie. Having been raised in the UP my whole life I am used to hunting and the woods and all that. I was excited to see that a movie was being made in Escanaba and so i went to the premiere and the filming and the whole nine yards.  Sure, there are a few jokes in the movie, but once the ""bear walk"" spirit alien thingy started, i got so ashamed and bored. This movie was awful.  It was just a poorly made movie.  In one scene, you can literally see the road blocks on the streets.  The acting was terrible, and i was ashamed to see Harve Presnell in it.  I like Jeff Daniels and I give him credit for ridiculing a town and making a town fall in love with him and praise him.  It got so bad that our Blockbuster and other video stores had ""Jeff Daniels sections"" in them and they included all his classics like Fly away home and 101 Dalmations.  Do not see this movie,  this is nothing what the U.P. is like.  We do not talk like we live in Fargo and we do not fart on each others head.  Deer Camp consists of drinking, playing cards, making loads of eggs and bacon, and sitting in the woods.  None of these things were in the movie.
This movie is not worthy of dvd or video or anything.",1031529600,2,1223,4.033195020746888
1756378,5,B00006HAX7,"This movie brought me into tears when I watched it at the local theater back in 2000. The movie was very funny and portrayed da yoopers perfectly. Now, I only hope Jeff Daniels produces another movie like this in Michigan.",1015027200,2,222,4.575

1756530,5,B00006HAX7,One of a kind deer hunter movie. Jeff Daniels should follow it with Danny and the Boys. It would be a nationwide hit.  As it is this one gets a bit silly but it is good fun.,1513296000,,173,3.675675675675676

1756584,5,B00006HAX7,"Quirky and funny, particularly if you've spent part of your childhood in deer camp every year.  For folks who say 'Love it, but turn it off when the UFO nonsense starts' they aren't getting the joke.  Because I've YET to be in a deer camp in my currently-47 years where the tall tales didn't start, and somebody was always willing to go one step further.

For those on the fence about this film, try to make it through the first half hour - the outhouse scene and the Jimmer's arrival are both ABSOLUTELY hilarious, particularly the other three trying to figure out what 'Muh shevvy shook a schiit!' means.",1508284800,,606,4.541284403669724
1756585,5,B00006HAX7,"One of the most poignant, heart moving movies every written. A story about friends, family, a man's great challenge and how he brought his family into an amazing place. My family has watched this time and time again, and never fails to be moved and motivated by it.

1756640,5,B00006HAX7,"This is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever watched. Having gone deer hunting a lot in my youth, the film accurately depicts most of the ritual things Brothers do as well as other family members who may or may not actually hunt. I recommend this film for anyone who has ever been to ""deer camp"". With the zany addition of things you will not see coming at you until they get there, the mostly comedy events are very well done.  I can watch this movie over and over again and still find subtle things I missed before. Great Fun !  ",1491782400,,542,4.242718446601942

1756785,5,B00006HAX7,"My friends and I saw this movie several years ago and it is without doubt one of the most hilarious films I have seen in years. It somehow reminded me of Adam Sandler's, ""Don't Mess With the Zohan,"" which I think may have been his best film yet - highly unappreciated as is this film.  You will either love it or hate it I suspect. We all laughed so hard it hurt!  I am not from Michigan and have never been there, so the UP is a foreign country to me.  Nonetheless, the satire of hunting culture/obsession was outstanding.  It gets extra points for the sheer bizarre nature of the script.  I don't hunt, but have friends who do.  It is a priceless film...  Comic genius of a very decidedly odd sort. The characters are at once familiar and very strange. If you like your humor highbrow, dry and cynical it might not be your cup of tea, but if not, you are in for a really good laugh.  Highly recommended.  Impossible to describe without spoiling on some level.  Best seen without a clue of what it is about. You can't possibly do the film justice in a review.  A unique comic gem.  Brilliant.  Buy it and be prepared to laugh a lot. It is a comedy meant to be humorous and irreverent on many levels. Good comedy is often about pointing out the absurd paradoxes in life and culture.  It is pointless to get offended by it.  There was clearly no malice intended by the film.  I applaud the movie for being fearless on many levels.  Other directors can learn a lot from this. We are creating a culture that is afraid to laugh at anything unless it has been sanitized to the point of sterility or is mean, sarcastic and sordid.  This film managed to just be what it was meant to be - funny.  My hat is off to Jeff Daniels - brilliant work!",1478390400,,1736,4.253822629969419

1756937,5,B00006HAX7,"Picture, if you will, laughing so hard that you are unable to breathe. That's the state my mother was in when she told me about this movie. The story is simple: a coming-of-age tale for a 43-year-old man who has yet to accomplish the local rite of passage that is bagging a buck. Unfortunately, it gets a lot more complicated when he performs a Native American ritual to give him luck in the hunt, failing to complete the most important element and leaving himself open to onslaught from evil spirits. What ensues is the weirdest, funniest damned movie I have seen in a long time. To me, this movie is a cult classic. I adore the Jimmer, the bearwalk, the DNR agent who went crazy in the woods, that poor deer behind the two-holer, Wolf Moon Dance, the euchre game -- all of it! This is a movie you just have to see to understand. Do not watch if you don't enjoy fart jokes, because it contains the longest, funniest one I have ever seen.",1461628800,,938,4.365714285714286

The humor is direct and goes through a typical day for a up'er, the dialect pronunciation is spot on (if a little thick) As a transplanted Up'er, I bought this movie many moons ago (as soon as it came out on VHS!)  A cult masterpiece to be shared with everyone in your circle. My kids and I quote this movie daily but, this gem from the Jimmer cannot be passed up. ""my chevy shook a ship"" and Mr Soatys ""You're a deer in my headlights Remnar..."" is perfect to let the little ones know they crossed the line. The movie kinda tanks after the hilarious fart scene and if you stick with it, you will have at least enjoyed your popcorn! And to the ones who say it pokes fun at natives... I disagree, it eliminates and pokes fun at life in the U.P.
(as a side note, I was always confused by Ruben heading south out of town...not like it matters, its deer camp.) Today, is opening day for us in Wisco, and to celebrate I made pasty's and we are pulling this fantastic movie out of the cupboard dusting it off and giving it a go.

It is so bad, a refund of my money would not be good enough.  I want the 92 minutes of my life back.  I am convinced that if it was not BY Jeff Daniels, this movie would NEVER have been made, let alone waste precious plastic to be burned into a DVD.

It was just boring.  I was looking forward to seeing it so much because it could have been such a nice movie.  I don't understand why movie makers settle for so little when they could create so much.

For those that haven't seen this yet, it's an absolute riot. One part becomes a little bizarre, but stick it out and keep going. Jeff Daniels shows all the reasons he's been successful in this industry for so many years. Great comedic timing and delivery coupled with warmth and a touch of vulnerability. The rest of the cast is outstanding as well, and any movie where you see Kimberly Guerrero smile like that is worth watching.

In all honesty, I would have given this movie 4.5 stars if they let me, but only because I reserve 5 stars for movies like To Kill a Mockingbird or Twelve Angry Men. For hunters, those that know hunters, and anybody who's ever been to or dreamed of living in the U.P., this movie is a must see. Deer camp will never be the same.",1386374400,,882,4.371951219512195

I'm from Michigan, born and raised. We've lived out of state, due to the military, for 5 years. Every time I get a little homesick, I watch this movie. One thing that rings true, whether or not you're from the U.P. or the mitten itself is - Opening Day is somewhat of a religious holiday in Michigan. Watching it tonight with my husband, I realized that guys celebrate each other's first buck like women celebrate an engagement ring or pregnancy lol. It's a big part of many a MI family's traditions. The beginning of the holiday season really. Opening Day, Thanksgiving, then Christmas :)

This movie is full of great one-liners, I find myself quoting all year long. I love the work that it brought to the area, and I love that Jeff Daniels continues to invest in MI.

I'm sorry, I understand how people want to like this movie, simply based on it's premise, but when a movie supposedly about deer hunting starts bringing in UFOs and hallucinations--it just makes things strange.

1758045,3,B00006HAX7,"Based on a play by Jeff Daniels--who also directed and stars--ESCANABA IN DA MOONLIGHT is the story of a family-owned deer camp where the Soady clan meets every year to hunt.  This year the family in attendance is patriarch Albert Soady (Harve Presnell) and sons Rueben (Jeff Daniels) and Remnar (Joey Albright.)  On this occasion they are joined by area eccentric ""The Jimmer"" (Wayne David Parker) and  terribly befuddled game warden Ranger Tom T. Treado (Randall Godwin.)  But when it comes to shooting deer, Rueben is jinxed and everybody in the whole town knows it, and if he doesn't make a kill this year he will become the oldest member of the Soady family who hasn't bagged a deer.

Fortunately, Rueben is married to a Native American woman named Wolf Moon Dance (Kimberly Guerrero), and she has come up with a tribal cure that involves some chanting, porcupine urine, and a potion made with milk, earthworms, and moose testicles.  But it seems her cure may be a bit too strong for the boys: before the night ends, they hear strange chants, see strange lights, endure possession, and almost explode in what has to be one of the most bizarre series of fart jokes ever put to film.  There is indeed a lot of humor in the film, and even some touching emotion.  But there's also a big problem with it.

The play is set in the Michigan upper penisula, and the humor relies a great deal on how well you know that culture--and how well you know the dialect.  Some of it I got and some of it I didn't, just went right over my head.  The performances are good, and the actors have a lot of fun with it, and if you don't bust a gut over the fart joke there's probably something wrong with you.  But on the whole, this is a movie that will be most enjoyed by people who know the region.  Recommended to them.

1758046,2,B00006HAX7,"Escanaba in Da Moonlight is a comedy about a man named Rueben Soady (Jeff Daniels) who lives on Michigan's rugged Upper Peninsula (the U.P.). Soady is ashamed because he is in his forties, but he has yet to shoot his first deer. Soady vows to change things and hijinks ensue.

There are some nice things about this film. The cast is good. I particularly like the three actors portraying the Soady clan; in addition to Rueben, viewers meet father Albert (Harve Presnall) and brother Remnar (Joey Albright). The film also has some beautiful visuals from the Upper Peninsula; I read online that this was the first movie filmed in the U.P. since 1959's Anatomy of a Murder.

For me, Escanaba in Da Moonlight misses the mark. One big problem is that the script relies on annoying slapstick humor. [...] If you like Chevy Chase, Jim Carrey, and that Hey Vern guy, you're going to love this film. Another problem is that the plot starts well, but quickly derails. Once the hunters arrive at their cabin (about one-third of the way through the film), it's all downhill. It's just one stupid scene after another with a tacked-on, sappy ending that does not fit the zany mood that the filmmakers established beforehand.

Judging from the reviews, Escanaba in Da Moonlight has a lot of fans. If you like slapstick, perhaps this film will entertain you.",1296432000,,1341,4.746781115879829

Jeff Daniels and the other actors could really be seen as the ""people next door"" in the woods of Northern Michigan.
  While the Bearwok and UFO scenes could have been deleted to keep the movie shorter and easier to understand, they were included in this movie because these topics always seem to come up during conversations at many areas of the North woods of Michigan.  Even the disregard and direspect for the Michigan DNR (Department of Natural Resources) officer is typical of any self-respecting Youper.

1758265,4,B00006HAX7,"I saw Jeff Daniels in concert over at the Big Tent Chautauqua next door in Wisconsin and in between singing his songs and playing the guitar he talked about having made a movie about hunting up on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  There are not a lot of movies about the U.P. (""Anatomy of a Murder"" comes to mind), so I decided to track down the film and check it out.  What I found was ""Escanaba in da Moonlight,"" which is based on a play that Daniel wrote for the Purple Rose Theater in Chelsea, Michigan.  Guy Sanville directed the play and helped come up with the story, but here Daniels does the screenplay, handles the directing chores, and plays the main character as well.  That would be Rueben Soady, who is the shame of both the Soady family and the town of Escanaba because he has never shot a buck.  That means Reuben in ""buckless"" (not to mention being called ""Bambi's best friend), and this little 2001 film is about his attempt to do something to rectify the situation.

So, basically, if are not into hunting or tall tales told by people who hunt, then you should probably pass on this movie.  The exceptions would be if you are a ""Yooper"" or a fan of Jeff Daniels, although I suppose if you liked ""Northern Exposure"" this one might appeal to you somewhat.  The story is set back in the fall of 1989, when Rueben had made it 43 years ""widdout baggin' a buck"" as they like to say up there and Deer Season had come around again.  Fortunately Rueben has on his side his wife, Wolf Moon Dance (Kimberly Norris Guerrero), who assures him that this will be his year and has followed the Ojibwe traditions in preparing him for the hunt.  Reuben's father Albert (Harve Presnell of ""Fargo"") serves as narrator when the film demands it, while Reuben's dopey brother Remnar (Joey Albright) chortles about Deer Season as being the equivalent of ""Christmas"" with guns.  Also joining them at the cabin is Jimmer Negamanee (Wayne David Parker), who was once abducted by aliens, and Ranger Bob (Randall Godwin) of the DNR, who stops by as well.  Now all Reuben has to do is not let his father and brother, the DNR, the space aliens, God, or the strange creature making noise out there in the woods stand in the way.

I am surprised my brother-in-law Pete is not in this movie, because most of the people in the film sound like Pete does when he launches into one of his stories, although they tend to be more about Scandinavians than about hunting as a general rule.  ""Escanaba in da Moonlight"" is a nice little comedy without pretensions and an interesting use of a moose testicle.  I was actually fooled by it because I got to thinking that what was happening was really an elaborate practical joke constructed by Reuben to get back at his family, but it turns out I was on the wrong track, which is not what you want to be doing out in the woods with people carrying loaded guns.  My only real complaint is that while there is a documentary about the making of the film entitled ""A Picture From Home: The Journey Through 'Escanaba in da Moonlight,"" you will not find that here but rather on a separate DVD.  So if you really love the film, Jeff Daniels, and/or happen to live in Escanaba, you would be motivated to track that down, otherwise your experience will end here with the movie itself.",1155945600,9,3297,4.477462437395659

If you have never been to Michigan, I can recommend the upper peninsula as a place to visit.

This is an excellent cast of stange and funny characters.  As a female, I am not typically fond of ""toilet humor"" however, I must point out that this movie contains THE FUNNIEST FART JOKE ON FILM TO DATE.  That one scene alone makes the film worthwhile.

1758338,4,B00006HAX7,"Escanaba in da Moonlight is a very weird movie. But then, the UP is pretty weird in itself. I think the closer you live to the bridge, the more you'll get this movie. Being from Northern Michigan, I found myself nodding amusedly with each mention of the pasty, fudgesuckers, the ever-present DNR (""stand by your vehicle, sir!"") and the strange venacular. This is a funny movie, especially if you're from Michigan. The acting is the best part. The cast caught the attitude and mannerisms of residents in the UP (I know a couple of guys who are exactly like Remnar) perfectly.

I response to one reviewer's comments that the Native American ritual performed so elegantly (sarcasm, folks) by Daniels was in some way offensive. Perhaps, but I don't think it was intended to mock the Objibwe rituals. The Native American population is a strong force in the communities, at least on this particular peninsula and it, let's not forget that it was through these beliefs that Reuban finally bags his buck. Jimmy Negamanee from Menominee cracked me up and while the farting scene was crude, it was funny. Everybody needs a little toilet humor every once in awhile and deer camp is the best possible place for it.

This is in no way an outstanding film masterpiece. It's a kind of inside joke to those of us who live in Michigan, particularly the UP and maybe even us ""trolls"" who live under the bridge. It's funny enough and clever, well acted, if a little quriky and weird. Rent it before you buy. UP humor is certainly an aquired taste.",1125360000,38,1528,4.676579925650557

Escanaba has a lot of heart and just enough weirdness to make it work.  Daniels and his cast obviously believe in the material (he'd better - he wrote it) and that pays off in a very watchable, film.  Taking place in a single day and night (the day before opening day of hunting season) this little movie takes off with a bang and rips through male bonding, family secrets, ancient ritual, metaphysics, philosophy, sibling rivalry, UFOs, aliens, God and farting.

The extreme hatred for the DNR, the fear of camp rituals changing, and the firm stubborness of the father Albert (Harve Presnell) were absolutely perfect.  Whether you're from the area or not, this quirky and slapstick comedy is at least a must-see.  I know some folks from the area felt insulted by the film, but I know more, including myself, that found the humor in it rather than feel like we were being stereotyped.  The bottom line is that the U.P. is one of the most unique places to be from and we should be proud of the fact that a great mind like Jeff Daniels was so intrigued by our little slice of Heaven that he made a film featuring it.

This is your typical boy-bags-buck story- only the boy is in his mid-40's and is known around town (Escanaba) as the ""Buckless-Yuper."" In fact, if he doesn't bag a buck this season he will go down in Soady family history as the oldest family member never to bag a buck. In fact his uncle (the family idiot) even bagged a buck by shooting through the outhouse wall. So, he shows up at the family deer camp for the 30th season in a row. But no one wants to hunt with him because they are convinced that he is cursed. It doesn't help that strange things start happening- from the whiskey going bad and the numbers on the playing cards changing, to UFO's and marauding bear spirits. My personal favorite scene is the family's decision to sacrifice a DNR ranger to appease the evil spirits.
It's a hoot, but then I used to live in the deep woods in the western UP- just north of the Mystery Lights (so nothing surprises me anymore.) Those folks from big cities like Escanaba always were a might high-strung.

1758383,3,B00006HAX7,"I'll probably get slammed for this, but I didn't really care for this movie all that much.  I wanted to like it, I really did, but it got a little weird for my tastes.  I really like Jeff Daniels, and I thought I would really enjoy this film, which he wrote and directed, and is also based on a play he wrote.
Jeff Daniels stars as Rueben Soady, a resident of the UP (Upper Peninsula) in upstate Michigan and comes from a long line of hunters.  In the story, deer season is beginning again, and Rueben has yet to 'bag a buck', or, to put it in English, he has never shot a deer.  This makes him sort of an outcast in his community, a man in his early forties, from a long line of hunters, and he has never shot a deer.
Well, as I said, deer hunting season is starting, and Rueben meets up with his father, Albert Soady, played by Harve Presnell (Fargo), his younger brother Remnar, and a really weird friend named Jimmer Negamanee at the family hunting cabin.  When this movie started, it had the makings of a warm, lighthearted comedy, but soon took a turn for the weird.  I have never been hunting, and I enjoyed much of the talk, reminiscing and adherence to traditions displayed within the film.  There were some truly funny scenes, but the movie soon started to incorporate elements of mysticism (Rueben's wife is a Native American and she is featured in a dream Rueben has), the occult, and the unexplained.  There were references to aliens, mystical bears, and ancient Native American rituals.  I wouldn't have minded it much, but I thought too much focus was placed on these parts, with over extended scenes involving all three.  Also, it seemed to me that the Native American rituals were sort of played off as being more hokey than a part of a vanishing culture, a vehicle to get a few laughs and not much else, giving me a sense of disrespect, but I am sure that wasn't the intention.
Another scene that seemed to drag on was one where Rueben somehow went into a catatonic state and his father and brother decided to try and bring him out of it by having a sleeping Jimmer expel gas on his face.  Now, when men get together in a setting such as this, they do tend to revert to more primal tendencies, I will not argue that, but this all seemed very silly and childish.  I don't mind silliness, but when taken to the lengths it was in this movie, it was just too much for me.
The movie had a number of good points, as I liked all the actors, but the plot veered off into enforced strangeness once too often for my tastes.  The potential was here from a great little movie, had they stuck more to reality.  I am sure a number of people, especially those who live in the northern Midwest or those with hunting experiences probably got more out of this than me, enjoy it more than I did.  There was a lot of quirkiness in the movie, which I generally enjoy when it comes naturally, but here is seemed like it was forced.
I am giving this movie three stars as it there were funny parts here and there, and it was imaginative, and I like Jeff Daniels, but I feel there could have been more here than there was...no real extras here in this full screen presentation.",1074643200,10,3170,4.340101522842639

Set in Michigan's UP, a. k. a. the Superior State by secession minded residents, it is not commentary about the ethics of hunting or vegetarianism or any other political or lifestyle choice. Many pacifists and vegetarians loved the original play on which this film is based.
In a community whose hunting traditions run deep, Rueben Soady is buckless. He's 43 and has yet to make his right of passage; he's  shunned by the entire town. Even his own friends and family don't want to hunt anywhere near him. In spite of it all he wants to fit in. This is the film's basis for universal appeal and why the play on which it was based on was so popular.
The driver's license has been called America's right of passage. At best it's a threshold to begin an adolescent quest, not complete it. Adolescence extends to the late 30s or longer for many. We call it finding ourselves-and our place in our community. The whole process is a mystery to Rueben Soady. Where will the flash of insight come from? UFOs? Is success influenced by spirits? He is clueless. He is desperate, so desperate that he's willing to subject himself to the humiliation of eating moose balls, wearing porcupine ""urine"" (the sensors are brutal), and breathing the foulest flatulence if that is what it takes to make the passage. Let's see if we can get out of the two-seater here. Rueben is desperate and willing, but needs the support of his family and friends. As cruel as it may be to be shunned by the community, the support of family and friends is even more affirming. Rueben must overcome a significant challenge to complete his passage and earn his place in the community. Is he up to it?
This is a story about real people who we may or may not know, to whom we may or may not relate, but we can certainly care about them, and hopefully we will learn from them. Have fun while you watch! You may even want to own it as a cult flick, but there's more to it than potty humor. These are metaphors for the all the bizare stuff we each endure in our individual quests. When we laugh at Rueben, we laugh at ourselves. We know the truth. We have lived it.
Jeff Daniels has chosen to entertain us with a comedy and uses caricatures to tell his story. Caricatures portray distortions and often offend the thin-skinned, but an insightful caricature is an exaggerated truth. This is Jeff Daniels' film. He uses his brand of comedy and it is hilarious.

This thread keeps the plot together, while the rest of the movie is spiced with (as my son would say) ""random"" characters and scenes that keep you laughing and wondering what Jeff Daniels was on when he wrote it (one can only assume it was a case of Leinenkugels).  Jemmer Megamanee from Menomanie is one of the most bizarre and refreshing characters of all time.  He is the proverbial ""wild haired gnome"" from War's ""Hall of the Mountain King"".

I usually enjoy British comedy, but Jeff Daniels wrote a real gem, here. The characters are coarse and ignorant, but loveable. The actors were cast perfectly--their body types, voices, and mannerisms perfect for their roles. The entire story takes place in a backwoods cabin, in Northern Michigan, where an unlucky man (accompanied by his firm father, crude brother, and an eccentric and unintelligable friend)has retreated, trying to break his bad luck, by hunting down a deer, and bringing it home to his Chippewa wife. The events in that little wood lodge take on supernatural proportions, when a Chevy catches on fire, and tries to run down a man who believes he was once visited by aliens, when the four of them drink sacred Native American potions for health that include such ingredients as baked worms, and when a mysterious creature is believed to be after them all, and must be warded off with... well, you have to see it. I especially like the scene in which the skinny sherrif has been stripped down to his underwear, and is tied to a chair, singing ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" while being splashed with pungent liquid. Ghosts, visions, homemade moonshine, strange lights, unusual cuisine, unique characters, bizarre humor, delightful local slang, and excellent timing abound in this movie. Its a family movie, for the theatre-lover and the basic middle American alike. 5 stars! (Note, I am a vegetarian who is, shall we say, anti-hunting, but that did not impact my enjoyment of the film. The plot takes far too many twists and turns for hunting to be the true heart of the story.

It is a film that pokes some good-hearted fun at the people who live in the upper peninsula (Yoopers!) as well as deer hunters.

So me and my dad brought this movie up to deer camp with us and we sat down with a load of other people and watched it, we had to stop the movie so many times. One time it got so bad someone Peed their pants. I have literally watched this DVD probably 25 times because i love, o my bad 26 i watched it today to. This jimmer guy is hilarious his chevy broke down he gets out it cathces on fire turns on and starts chasing him. Iam a hunter and if your not a hunter it doesnt matter this movie is a must see for everyone not just us ""Michiganders"". But if you are from Michigan you might find it more appealing especially me since I HUNT a few miles north of Escanaba. People at our deer camp like this movie so much one guy bought 6 copies and gave them away as christmas gifts.",1043712000,5,955,3.9533678756476682
1758456,4,B00006HAX7,"....is what I would describe Escanaba in Da Moonlight. Being that I am only a few hundred miles or so from the 'Fudgesucker' borderline that is the Mackinaw Bridge and a hunter myself, I can relate to some of the mischief and mayhem exhibited in this Jeff Daniels play-turned-movie. Now when I say some, don't take it either way of it's not true or it is true, but as a sign that the movie was, indeed, adapted from a play and it shows itself too much as that towards the end. However, don't let that deter you from witnessing some funny stuff that's so out there you wonder why we hunters make animal lovers a bit nervous.
Jeff Daniels, a native Michigander, did well in bringing to life and in detail elements needed to make it authentic; sometimes too much so to the point of unreal. Much of what happens in the Deer Camp, the central scene that lasts throughout much of the movie, is like any cabin in the woods, only needing a car battery to keep the power up. To top it off they even had a Two-Holer outhouse; two toliets! Any hunter will tell you that's essentially in group hunts.
I found the history that is relayed in the story about the successful kills and the humorous circumstances behind them to give added depth and sometimes emotion. Yes, it's true: sometimes a man in the Upper is defined by his Big Buck. The part about the U.F.O.'s is hillarious but gets old fast, and towards the end you do feel as if you sat through a play and not a movie, which sometimes plays drag too long. There's some moments in the end, which I won't reveal, that will leave you down a bit, perhaps too down when the end is finally reached.
Again, though, I did find this movie very funny and warm even if it isn't entirely accurate. Let's just say Jeff Daniels got it 80 percent right; high enough to draw the hunters out of the woods to go buy a DVD and enjoy the movie.
As for the DVD itself: not much to it, but that's the DVD's selling point: the movie, not the extras or lack thereof. I think some movie studios are too insecure about the movies they make and pack it with stuff; rightfully so. This hasn't got flash, but it does have substance.",1043625600,4,2147,4.316831683168317
1758457,5,B00006HAX7,"This is a truely unique and ""Michigan-Upper-Penisula-Centric"" movie.
To anyone who lives in or comes from Michigan, this is one of the funniest films you will see in years, because if you have lived anywhere in Michigan north or west of the Metro Detroit Area, you know these characters are real and have probably met a few of them. Having family conections to the Traverse City area, and coming from a family of deer hunters, I can vouch for the accuracy of the ""Deer Camp"" cabin portrayed, right down to the old Michigan license plates on the walls,the never ending Eucher game, and ""Da Two Holer.""  The complex Soady family relationships are wonderfully offset by the truely unique character of ""Da Jimmer.""
But you don't have to be from ""Da Superior State"" to enjoy this movie. Based on a long running hit play (in Michigan, anyway) of the same name, written by Jeff Daniels (who also adapted, directed, produced and starred in this movie), the humor is broad enough to be enjoyed by others not lucky enough to come from the Great Lakes State.
There is much more here than just a potential cult movie due to the abundance of insider jokes about Yoopers. This is a funny story about family and ""Huntin' Buddies,"" and includes an insider's view of some of the mysteries and rituals of ""Male Bonding.""
The small cast of actors turn in very enjoyable and believable performances!",1041552000,5,1379,4.721991701244813

The people of Esky should be ready to run Jeff Daniels out of town. To me when one is called a Yooper it is the same as being a red-neck and an insult to one's intelligence and  culture.  We are not as he portrays and I feel sorry for anyone who even thinks this is funny.  Maybe they are the true Yoopers- and they deserve the name.  I for one will not recommend this to anyone-not even as a joke. We DO NOT drink porcupine pee and fart on eachother's heads.  Maybe they do.,1041379200,2,619,4.203389830508475

1758460,2,B00006HAX7,"I started watching this film with a smile.  It began just as I had hoped  -- the story of a simple man preparing to do battle with his greatest fear: that at 43 he is about to become the oldest member of the Soady family never to have bagged a buck.  Everything pointed toward a wam and humorous tale which would allow us to root for the poor yooper in his great lifelong struggle.  The set up was beautiful; a loving and encouraging Native American wife who sends him on his way with a tribal prayer; a wonderfuly funny sequence as the jinxed hunter drives through town; and a hilarious introduction to his susperstitious brother and  doubting father, played to perfection by Harve Presnell. The inside look at the rituals of deer camp cap it all off and we settle in, anticipating the unfolding of the rest of the story.
Unfortunately its not an unfolding which takes place but rather an unravelling instead.  What had started out as an interesting and humorous family tale, is suddenly replaced with repeated bouts of gross humor and utter zaniness.  In short, the films original premise is gone like so much smoke up the chimney of the cabins potbellied stove.  And in its place we are left dealing with two new characters, who, although hilarious at times, are completely intrusive and serve no purpose whatsoever in supporting the story.  I watched in hopes that this was just a brief detour.  But it didn't take long to see that Daniels had completely lost his way with the script, as if he didn't know where to take the second act at all.  Finally, after all of this unnecessary bouncing off the walls humor, we're expected to reconnect with Daniels' character and  the films mawkish denouement.  By the time he looks through the sight and squeezes the trigger, it mattered very little to me how it ended.
This film had so much potential.  If Daniels had stayed true to his character and his story, this might have been a wonderful movie.  But I'm afraid it falls far short of expectations.  Too bad.  Because I really respect Jeff Daniels as an actor, and as someone who returned to his roots in Michigan, starting the Purple Rose Theatre and committing himself to working with Midwestern talent both in the theatre and in film.  I sincerely look forward to him bouncing back with ""Supersuckers.""",1036108800,6,2305,4.663366336633663

1758463,4,B00006HAX7,"Escanaba in Da Moonlight is a hysterical film about the traditions of deer hunters, and one family's bizarre ordeal on the opening day of deer season.
The first film in actor/director Jeff Daniels' Purple Rose film company, which will make films exclusively in his home state of Michigan, Escanaba in Da Moonlight is a gem of a comedy. And while the humor will especially hit home for residents of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (The Superior state, as they call it), and those living in other ""deer country"" states such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, this movie has plenty of laughs for everyone.
Centering on the Soady family on their annual cabin trip the first day of deer season, the film explores the trials and tribulations of the ""buckless yupper,"" Reuben Soady, (Jeff Daniels).
Now, fair warning, this movie gets pretty bizarre. Among the occurrences the Soady family has on its day of hunting are UFO's, a government agent gone mental, possession and Native American superstitions.
But all the insanity leads to big laughs. And it doesn't let up until near the end, where the only flaw lies. The film crosses the line of becoming too sentimental, offering too much cheese. If Daniels toned it down a bit at the end, the film would have been perfect.
But the film is still a highly enjoyable look at the world of the ""U.P."" (The Upper Peninsula), and is worth multiple viewings. Make it a tradition to watch this on the opening day of deer season. It's well worth it.",1035676800,4,1469,4.764705882352941

1758489,4,B00006HAX7,"I'd like to begin by saying it was very strange seeing my hometown on a movie screen, very weird just like some of the scenes in this picture.  The Upper Peninsula, or U.P. as locals refer it to, is one of those regions of the country that is ripe for stereotyping.  The large number of Scandinavian descendents has created a unique accent not unlike Minnesota.  It is a source of amusement to outsiders and I have to admit going home a few times a year, I detect it as well.  Then promptly pick up a bit of it and get razzed when I return to Iowa where I now live.  However, anyone who equates the unique environment, colloquialisms, and accent with ignorance is making a very big error in judgment.  The level of education in the U.P. far surpasses other areas in the US with the same or higher population density.  You will find many college graduates not using their skills and accepting low paying jobs for the privilege of living in this very special and beautiful country.  I had a small problem with this stereotyping in the movie but the incredible humor over road my objections.  And believe me, this movie is incredibly humorous for those who can relate to it.

The sanctity of camp and pasties was depicted with such accuracy, I am sure that Jeff Daniels spent a good deal of time gathering information sitting around camp.  Every female growing up in the U.P. looks forward to camp almost as much as the hunters and there are a very rare few who accompany them there.  Camp is sacred.  It is the place where a few weeks out of the year men can be manly, men.  They can live like pigs, eat what they want, drink, fart, play cards and basically do all those things they can't in their own homes every other day of the year.  They usually come home to rearranged or new furniture (because all the women know how much money is spent in the hunting venture), new hairstyles and clothing or on a few occasions `traveling' papers.  Hunting season is an institution and that was accurately depicted in this piece.

The slant on Native American legends and beliefs was rather insulting and made into a trivial object when it deserves a great deal more respect.  The spiritualism of this culture should not be treated in this manner any more then other forms of religion.  The `weirdness' of how it was presented detracted greatly from the movie.  My entire family felt this way.  When your teenagers agree with you on a subject, it's a rare occasion and deserves notice.

Overall, our living room was filled with recognition, understanding and great deal of laughter.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who can relate to the U.P., hunting or the Red Green Show.",1034812800,,2670,4.551362683438155

Counting land and equipment expenses....12 years and over a 100,000 dollars later  I'm paying a bit more to deer hunt.  This movie is a labor of love from Jeff Daniels...and if you think you have to be from ""UP NORTD"" to enjoy this flick then you  probably  thought Jim Varney's character of Ernest was from your neck of the woods.
The movie is a combination of reality  and mythology in the pursuit of the  elusive whitetail deer.  Its like being a fly on the wall at a reunion of deer tales.  I felt the incorporation of Jeff Daniels wife as a native American natural hunter was a nice touch.  She helps him with a ""magic elixr"" that they all drink and it takes them on a fantasmagoric trip though the dreams and nightmares of all deer hunters.
The total anti hunting crowd of course won't like it...but there are no actual  deer kills or anything like it shown in the picture.  There is some guy fart humor...but its awful funny and the dream  sequence stuff is pretty wild.  I'd call it a PG for 12 and above.
Escanaba in da Moonlight should be required viewing for all deer hunters the night before the opener just  like Its A Wonderful Life and Christmas Story have been for Christmas.  Afterall like one of the characters says... ""I love the Deer Opener...its like Christmas with guns!"".
