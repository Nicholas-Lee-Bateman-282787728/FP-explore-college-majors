8195975,2,B000QFAFMM,"""China Heat"" is a numbingly average addition to the Hong Kong ""girls with guns"" subgenre, co-directed by William Cheung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Duel-of-Kung-Fu/dp/B000059XUB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Duel of Kung Fu</a>) and starring Sibelle Hu and Michael DePasquale. Unless these names mean anything special to you, I advise you to save your money, because there's nothing that this one does which&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corey-Yuen/dp/6305235155/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corey Yuen</a>&nbsp;didn't do better six years earlier.

The story: a Hong Kong task force led by Captain Hua (Hu,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Lucky-Stars/dp/B0000V46DQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Lucky Stars</a>) follows a crime lord (action director Allen Lan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Detective-Dee-The-Mystery-of-the-Phantom-Flame/dp/B005M9VSMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Detective Dee & The Mystery of the Phantom Flame</a>) to the United States.

Michael DePasquale is the main reason I bought this. He looks like a smaller version of Sly Stallone and isn't well known (his only solo vehicle, ""The Cutoff"", has yet to receive proper distribution), but after seeing him fight in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-the-Kickboxers/dp/6302128161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of the Kickboxers</a>, I was eager to see more stuff with him in it. ""China Heat"" here is one of the few movies wherein he has a role of substance, but it's disappointingly unsatisfying: he and the other performers are caricatures at best - something I could've lived with, but they're not even bolstered by good action scenes (more on them in a moment). The movie is so very uninspired that it'll be admirable if you bother to remember any of the characters' names. Early on, the film teases some over-the-top violence when Allen Lan makes an undercover cop's head explode with a gunshot, and later on both Sibelle Hu and DePasquale fight a pair of male assassins in drag, but the rest of the movie plays things relatively tame and detached. The entire production feels pretty uninvolving, so it's hard to give a hoot for anything that happens onscreen.

One of Sibelle Hu's subordinates - either Sherry Han or Cindy Mong; I can't tell, because the credits list them by names not included in the subtitles - has a pretty good fight against a crowd of attackers in the middle of the movie, with plenty of fast-paced choreography and minimal cutting of camera angles. That's where the fun stops, sadly: a few skirmishes are found here and there, but the rest of the five battles are remarkably uninventive and substandard by Hong Kong criteria. Sibelle Hu fights Sophia Crawford (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-S-Seals-2/dp/B00005RDRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U.S. Seals 2</a>) in a boring exchange and DePasquale takes on both Mark Houghton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-on-Fire/dp/B00004RECY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel on Fire</a>) and Allen Lan in fights so clumsy that I began to wonder whether it was really worth pursuing this guy. DePasquale manages to work some of his signature jujitsu into his tussles but looks really uncomfortable with the rhythm of the fights; and Sibelle's choreography is just bland as heck.

That's about all I got for this one. Fans of Sibelle Hu might be happy to see her in another fighting role, but otherwise it's just not worth the shipping cost.",1337299200,,3705,6.493927125506073
