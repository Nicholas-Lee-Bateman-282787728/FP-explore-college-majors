5444142,5,B00AJUTFA2,"This is an excellent set of exercise DVD's for anyone who is interested in getting back to an exercise routine.  The steps are basic and simple and easy to learn.  At the same time, they are more challenging than you might think.  It took a little while, but by midway through the programs I was feeling warm and breathing a little harder-- but I never felt too much ""burn"", which is good.  I think they are a great choice for anyone who has stopped exercising for whatever reason or simply needs a low-impact workout due to injuries or illnesses.

Because the exercises are relatively simple (particularly on the walking disc), once I learn them, I play them on my laptop, turn the volume off, and do the workout while watching a regular TV program.  That way I'm off the couch, enjoying a show and getting a workout done at the same time.  It's my new rule-- no watching my ""guilty pleasure"" TV shows unless I also work out.  So far I've been really pleased with the results.  I've dropped pounds and I just generally look better and more toned.  With 4 discs you have lots of choices, and the bonus meditations are great for relaxing before you go to bed.",1451779200,10,1158,4.4714285714285715

5444144,5,B00AJUTFA2,"Was a gift for my Mom (who is 65) and she loves it!  It's just her speed with no jumping or harm to the knees.  She says Jane also tells her which muscles are being worked and the proper way to do it.  I got her all four DVDs, so she rotates each day.",1413244800,,251,3.611111111111111
5444145,5,B00AJUTFA2,"I really like these DVD's.  The overall workouts and walking routine provide a comprehensive, easy to follow program to keep you fit, flexible and heart healthy.  If you are a Boomer, or older, this is completely age appropriate and offers multiple ability levels.  Jane is fun and relatable.  I had her DVD's from the early days and knew the routines by heart.  These have similar, standard dance steps and I was able to fully participate the first time around.  So anyone can do this!  It's up to you and your current state of fitness to step it up to meet your goals.  Great program.  I'm so glad she created this new set.",1411603200,,625,4.508928571428571
5444146,1,B00AJUTFA2,does not work in my region. plus it just looks like a person has copied this video as format is like one. very disappointed.,1410825600,,124,4.208333333333333
5444147,4,B00AJUTFA2,"I tell you, she is easy to follow and you will get a great work out. Is clear to see why she is in the shape she is in, even with hip replacements.",1390435200,,147,3.484848484848485
5444148,4,B00AJUTFA2,"Call me old fashion but Jane Fonda's tapes works for all physical levels for many different people.  You can advance to the next tape if you have mastered the first, second and third one.",1368403200,2,187,4.5

She is amazing",1361491200,2,103,3.9523809523809526
5444150,5,B00AJUTFA2,"I fell off the workout wagon and needed to get back on.  These DVD's have really helped!  I'm moving, getting toned and I really enjoy it.  I'm not over exerting myself, but I am working at a level that makes me sweat and feel like I'm getting a good workout.  I'm really happy with my purchase and would highly recommend these.  Jane just keeps getting better with age and she motivates us to do the same!",1506384000,3,406,4.2894736842105265
5444151,5,B00AJUTFA2,"it's no secret pretty much all of these routines are online, but i was going on vacation to a place without good interwebs and i didn't want to give up my routine of doing jane. hence, the video purchase.  these routines have been a good starting off point for me.  i am coming off a period of time of being mostly sedentary (5 years).  these routines got my body feeling strengthened and it's hard to overdo it (but not impossible, mind you). find the pace that is right for you.  now i am getting back in the gym and feeling even stronger and days when i can't make it i use my jane videos.",1497398400,4,592,4.166666666666667
5444152,5,B00AJUTFA2,"I love these DVDs.  Great for seniors or those that are just coming back to an exercise routine.  They give you choices to start slow and build up.  Great warm ups and cool downs.  Just love the encouragement she gives.  As always Jane, Great Job!",1494028800,3,247,4.4

5444156,5,B00AJUTFA2,"What can I say? I love Jane. Her Prime Time series is fantastic.  These are excellent and if you like one, I'd just go ahead and get them all for a bit of a change up every now and then. I rotate them out for different workouts or meditations.  I love Jane and more than a few times she has me laughing or smiling. I recommend these and my mother does, too. Jane - you rock!",1474156800,,374,3.9078947368421053
5444157,5,B00AJUTFA2,"I have had problems with arthritic knees for a few years and finally had knee replacement surgery a little over a year ago. It was difficult to continue in my aerobic group at the gym, so I purchased this package of 4 DVDs and an inside exercise bicycle. I can't give enough praise for these DVDs. I like two of them more than the others but they all work. Many of the muscle toning exercises can be done sitting down in a chair, which is a plus for some. The walk-out is my favorite and it is possible to combine both the slower and faster walk-outs after each other. I could do them every day. The muscle-toning Trim, Tone and Flex is my second favorite and I can manage both the easier and more difficult workout after each other with very few problems. My only gripe is that, because of my bad knees, I can't do the floor work, but I have adapted those exercises to doing them standing with my weight on a sturdy chair.. The dance routines in Firm and Burn are also very nice and I usually do all three for a good work-out. The music gets a bit boring after a while but the moves/steps are great. Finally, there is the Fit and Strong. I like this one as well, but I don't think it is as effective as Trim, Tone and Flex.

Jane Fonda is great at supporting during the DVDs and I applaud her for caring enough for us ""oldies"" to make DVDs that are adapted to our needs.
She has a few problems with keeping with the beat in a few places, but it's nothing that disturbs the quality of the work-out.

I recommend these DVDs to people over 50 who want to be able to exercise at home, people who have physical disabilities or who have had surgery who want to get in shape at home in a gentle way, and really, to anyone looking for an exercise DVD that doesn't make you feel like a physically challenged idiot!",1469318400,3,1806,4.2017291066282425
5444158,5,B00AJUTFA2,Great DVDs for those of us in our Prime. Well done Jane!,1453852800,,56,3.75
5444159,5,B00AJUTFA2,"These work out videos are great for persons of my age (over 55).  I tried other videos with all the 25-35 yr. old instructors and I quickly remember my age.  At the time Jane Fonda made these videos, she was 72 yrs. old!  She has 1 knee replacement and 1 hip replacement.  She is still very flexible and very fit and the exercises put you to task but won't discourage or kill you! You can walk through the exercises if you need to and not fall behind.  I think these are great!",1452384000,3,477,4.141304347826087

8552726,2,B00AJUTFA2,High impact Aerobics.  I am in my mid-fifties and these tapes make my hips and knees hurt.  Love you Jane and I cant believe that you do these work outs in your 80s.  I don't want to end up having hip and knee replacements like you.  Having said this your still my favorite actress.,1527206400,,282,4.166666666666667

8552728,5,B00AJUTFA2,"I've worked out to these DVDs 2 to 3 times a week since I received them. They're perfect for the ""older"" generation and they've been instrumental in keeping me moving and maintaining my weight. Jane gets a little redundant at time, but I just turn off the sound and put on my own music..",1525219200,,287,4.333333333333333

8552730,5,B00AJUTFA2,"To be honest, watching ""Grace & Frankie"" on Netflix inspired me to purchase these DVDs.  I was never a fan of Jane in the 80s, but I love her new show.  I can't handle high impact aerobics.
Never really could. And forget complicated dance moves!!!  I bought these to mix in with the myriad of walking DVDs that I own.  I haven't done the aerobics DVDs yet, but the strengthening routines are easy to follow and can easily be amped up by using heavier weights.",1517097600,,459,4.364705882352941

Fast forward 25 years...I went on YouTube and tried one of the old workouts and thought I was going to die!!! So Im starting with these. They are great! If I want a little challenge, I hop or do a light jog when shes walking. Im hoping to work up to the old workouts in about a month or so. Im doing these on rotation with her yoga DVD. 1 workout a day! I try really hard not to think about the fact that Im 43 and Jane was 72 when she made these!!
