8166215,5,B000M4IF60,I really loved this drama. Is really sad and romantic. These two characters had that hot chemistry. The only thing about this drama that was kind of annoying was how much the lead actress cried. OMG!!! way tooooo much but overall it was a good drama.,1251417600,,250,4.456521739130435
8166216,4,B000M4IF60,"I just found out that Tree of Heaven is a spin-off of Stairway to Heaven. That explains why they have similar lines of conversation particularly towards the end. Both also have almost the same ending that implies how love goes on beyond a mortal's life, that everybody will eventually goes to heaven no matter what, and that heaven is where people get to resume what they've experienced on earth.

Personally, I find TOH better, younger, fresher, more compact and more straightforward (less redundant) than STH with its fewer episodes and fullness of actions. It also has something for everybody: from teen love to mafia (with that I mean comical type of mafia which is fun to watch). The movie also breaks mafia stereotype (that's usually very serious, calculating, mature and never have fun in 'childish' ways) although it still exagerates and retains the wicked stepmother and step siblings stereotype as in STH.

The storyline is alright, but the casting is great. I think that Lee Wan and Park Syin Hye shine in this movie. It's their biggest role so far. You can't help but fall in love with the couple. The chemistry is obviously there. Lee Wan is so believable being an autistic loner with a talent for drawing and strong affection for Park Syin Hye. He then turns to be a mafia boss' trusted man, God knows why and how. It's a bit lacking in explanatory connection there, but who cares? I watched Lee Wan and found in him young Tony Leung but with less charisma, which may stem from the fact that he's young and less experienced. Park Syin Hye plays a lovable character that's vulnerable, compassionate but more and more daring to be true to herself towards the end even if it means that she has to stand against the whole world.

For Korean tearjerkers, TOH is absolutely my first pick.",1182902400,3,1796,4.713375796178344
