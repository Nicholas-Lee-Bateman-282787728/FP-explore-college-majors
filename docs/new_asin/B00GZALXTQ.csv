8628853,1,B00GZALXTQ,"When I compare this Sonnambula with the Met version with Florez  Dessay and Pertusi, I find  the Met version vocally is far superior.
However this version is note complete, whereas the Met has minor cuts. The Met staging makes no sense at all, whereas this version has
tried to update Sonnambula to modern times in a very provincial town but is rather crude. If you only want one Sonnambula I would recommend the Met version despite the unfortunate staging as a rehearsal for a Sonnambula production..",1469318400,,501,4.813953488372093
