4254586,5,B00439GWQK,"I discovered Martin Shaw on PBS' Masterpiece Mystery in PD James' ""The Murder Room"" and ""Death in Holy Orders"".  He's really not known here but he's quite good (check out Judge John Deed and George Gently--very good Brit shows).  This film is one of those neat quirky British films involving criminals trying to reform.  The character is hiding out in the circus world while being stuck saddled with a drunken shrew of a wife then along comes a hardn-nosed detective, who's disliked by his colleagues, who has it in for Don, and a sympathetic woman who enters the picture.  There are funny and sad twists and turns which I won't reveal as they'd spoil the story--without car chases and gun fire.  The film is good for repeat viewings.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ladder-of-Swords/dp/B00439GWQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ladder of Swords</a>",1292371200,9,888,5.646616541353383

moor, a bear, a circus and two hearts made for each other.
Oh yes and even a Clouseau and a body apropos of a
misguided wife. I loved it. Ending and all. With wonderful
actors in timeless theater.",1498867200,,257,4.354166666666667

8414445,4,B00439GWQK,"Enjoyable, in that it was quite unique.
Love how the main character was so
versatile in the art of circus tricks. The
inspector was relentless in his pursuit
of the couple, when the body was left
in the hole he had dug. Full of twists
and turns, the story will make you laugh.",1486339200,,276,4.226415094339623

8414451,4,B00439GWQK,"This is one of those small movies with great actors and an actual storyline. I base movies on whether or not I would watch them again and who I'd recommend them to. I have watched this one several times and would only recommend it to a few people I know because the others wouldn't get it.
So if you like Martin Shaw you will be more than happy, if you like movies with no F/X just a story and fine acting you will enjoy this as well.",1402358400,4,434,4.0
