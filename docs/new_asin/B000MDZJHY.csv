8535657,2,B000MDZJHY,"William Grefe made a lot of exploitation films in the 70's. This is not one of his best. Christopher George and Roberta Collins play Bill and Diane, a couple on a motorcycling vacation with their best friends Dan (Preston Pierce) and Jamie (Linda Borgeson). Diane's family owned land on Whiskey Mountain in North Carolina and there was a legend of a cave that held firearms and relics from the civil war. They decide to visit there. The locals try to dissuade them, with good reason. A gang of drug dealers have taken over the mountain and the cave to store their product. The men ae separated from the women, who are raped  (not too graphically) by the gang. The men find that the local law will not help them (the sheriff is a gang leader).They also run afoul of a psycho old man in the woods. Bill manages to fight off the gang and get the women out, but the gang leader descends on them to make sure there is no happy ending. A lot of 70's drive-in films had downer endings like this, particularly William Grefe's films. The actors are capable but not given much to do.",1368230400,,1073,4.41919191919192
