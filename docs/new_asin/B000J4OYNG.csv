You have got a chance to watch him sing in English while he was in his late twenties in this movie, quite good actually. Yes, most of the dialogues are in French and the main English speaking character is the main actress's husband who is an American. I agree with the movie would be more entertaining if it can be dubbed in English.",1515024000,,398,4.465753424657534

8149225,1,B000J4OYNG,"Finally tried to watch the video and I'm very upset that it's NOT spoken in English as advertised. It has subtitles but that's not why I bought the DVD version - I already own a VHS cassette with spoken English and I wanted the same in DVD format. Now I have 2 Dvd's of this in French. Really Pissed off!

Fast response. Great experience",1437523200,3,337,4.265625
