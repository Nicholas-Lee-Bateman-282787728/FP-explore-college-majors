7866153,3,6304224761,"Happenstance brought me to this film, drawn like a moth to flame by the menacing VHS box-art visage - the tableau a delightful blend of decadent autocracy and paralyzing futurism. The first viewing elicited memories of the Noh tradition, strong, immutable masculine characters cavorting about, shaking the shackles of special effects limitations to pantomime a fundamental conundrum ""What if malevolent ducks exist in another dimension?"" Further screenings, however, revealed a much more robust story, oozing with crisis and context that would draw praise from the most jaded of viewers. This film shatters the proscenium, mandating that YOU the viewer participate in this most wonderful of farces. Undulating between sensations of grief and victory, pugnacious jingoism and Elizabethan turgidity, this film scape is one to behold and be beholden to.",1332460800,4,850,5.596899224806202
7866154,5,6304224761,"This fine film, with its masterful commentary on the politics of the Third World through use of a duck motif, is truly the high water mark of late 20th century film. The character of Rudy is masterfully played by the young Bryan Terrill, who is surely one of the greatest actors of his generation. His delivery on such lines as ""Cool!"" would surely make Constantin Sergeyevich Stanislavsky weep with pride. I simply cannot understand why the studio neglected to reissue a 10th anniversary edition, but I wait with bated breath the 20th anniversary edition. Do yourself a favor and buy this life-changing film!",1332460800,,609,4.922330097087379
7866155,5,6304224761,"Magic in the Mirror is a story about love, war, and unbridled enthusiasm. The young boy, Rudy, is a curiously intelligent character, yet has a childish naivet that leads Rudy into trouble.

The title of the movie, wildly suggestive, yet under complete control of the flawless director, only gives a hint of the magical journey the audience will experience throughout the film.

I cannot stress the dire importance of seeing this masterpiece. In fact, you shouldn't even be reading my review, because your family should be running to the nearest movie store to get this movie for your viewing pleasure.",1142294400,,601,5.0
7866156,5,6304224761,"This movie is a masterpiece.  Anybody that wishes to observe filmmaking at its finest must, absolutely must watch Magic in the Mirror:Fowl Play. There are simply no words to describe the eclectic mix of visual entertainment and virtuoso acting seen in Magic, but one word does spring to mind: breathtaking... spectacular, miraculous.  Oh I'm sorry, that was three.  And I could go on.

Special attention must be paid to the character Rudy and the actor who plays him.  Little Bryan truly captures the spirit of acting and possesses amazing star quality.  That kid has talent. I can only hope that he has pursued a future career in acting.  To not do so would be a friggin' disservice to the world.",1142294400,,697,4.758333333333334
