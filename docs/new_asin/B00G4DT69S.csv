I received my order on time, and its in decent condition. I already knew it was used, so I wasn't expecting it to be perfect. However, if I were selling a used movie to someone, I would at least make sure the DVD itself was clean. The disc was FILTHY when I pulled it out of its case. As if it was just sitting out in the open for months collecting dust on the movie side. I had to go to the store and get special CD/DVD cleaner and clean the disc before I could even watch the movie. So, thank you for selling me your movie, its great. But next time, please make sure the disc is clean before packaging it up to be sold.",1517270400,,742,4.02027027027027
