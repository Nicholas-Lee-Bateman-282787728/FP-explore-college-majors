First of all I can't believe these wacky kids are from Canada and are really funny. I like the fact that is truly is a variety show with very well done ( a little budget which I find charming!) sketch comedy not to mention the underground edge with all their drag queen and pop star interviews. It's odviously an independant venture ( Which is very, very refreshing with all the crap out there) and worth every penny! I can't wait for season 2 and hope for a season 3!  I really like that the cast is attractive yet don't seem to take themselves too seriously as they can be very homely in certain skits like the Tammy Faye one and the TV sales ladies-  Deb and Sisi. The Miss Cotton phone sex commercial is genius! Pimp and Ho are campy and fun. I love the Wiggle Fashion stuff.",1195689600,,981,4.212765957446808
8437613,5,B000UPXGI8,"I saw some clips on youtube and thought they were funny so I ordered the DVD and it's FABulous!  It's mostly sketches but also has some interviews and guests and is apparently the world's first all gay sketch comedy show. It's like all gay SNL but actually funny. I can't get enough right now and can't wait for season 2. My favorite characters are pimp and ho, James Bond like superhero duo who save the world from evil heteros like Doctor Normal in a few episodes, the sexy Latino queer eye guy is really funny and the home shopping drag queens. They are so fabulous. The boys in the cast are pretty cute too but I LOVE Ms. Cotton.",1195171200,2,633,4.319327731092437

Oh Ya talk about HUGE Self absor-bent Alter-EGOS!!! It's like being forced into Drag Nite-mare, imagine your glue-ons stuck to your A__! Nothing against them cause I LOVE to support Fabulous Talents of QUALITY not 'Tiring, Bitter, Clampy Oh Me Me Me & More about Me' Torch Dimming Drag Divas! I watched their Show on T.V. , I tried atleast & they even made it looked Low Budget without efforts. (Bad Camp & Bad Wigs!)
& as for Dj Dick-doo, since I've partied around the Globe, his Music's still after all these years - doo doo... Contrived & Flat Out zzzzzzzzzzz!
