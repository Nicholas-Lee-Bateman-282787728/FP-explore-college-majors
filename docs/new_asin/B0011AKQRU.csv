8241325,2,B0011AKQRU,"I really did not  enjoy this video much.  I was bored through most of it, until he went to his board.  The DVD picked up when the pony in the  background started trying to get in the video.  That was so funny.  I didn't find there was any earth shattering material and this was a short, and expensive DVD.  I would not recommend it.  I have found more useful information on Youtube for free.",1432771200,,391,4.1891891891891895
8241326,5,B0011AKQRU,this dvd is going to be so helpful in the training of my young horse. I am very pleased Ive bought it,1409011200,,101,3.6363636363636362
8241327,3,B0011AKQRU,The man is at ease around his horses.  but I think sometimes these videos need a few more caveats.  Some of the things he is teaching viewers to do with their horses could lead to bad habits when misinterpreted.,1398729600,,211,4.384615384615385
8241328,4,B0011AKQRU,I like the idea of light of hand but think he needs to focus more on stretching down for the first year or so and getting off the horses back.  I modified his method to teach the horse to stretch instead of going into frame and slowly bring the pole up over a year.  More focus need to be on moving from behind instead of just carrying their head in frame.  Still  much better than forcing the head down using rolkur or ldr,1391212800,,423,4.0602409638554215
8241329,5,B0011AKQRU,"Excellent, though he uses a horse that is not a beginner, you can see all the reactions to the ques that you will be looking for in your own horse. And you can see just how the ques help the horse to come to relaxation in the work. If you understand that a soft mobile (chewing) mouth promotes a soft supple back then you understand why these basics are so important.",1386720000,2,367,4.183098591549296
8241330,5,B0011AKQRU,"P Karl has the ability to get to the heart of the knowledge needed to get you being successful without any fear of failure.
This first dvd gives you logical information that you can apply strait away.",1383004800,,200,4.4324324324324325
8241331,5,B0011AKQRU,Excellent book! Easy to read and understand. This book addresses the problems with modern dressage and bring the rider back to classical riding in a simple and well thought out manner. This should be required reading for anyone who wants to sit on the back of a horse.,1377475200,,268,4.604166666666667
8241332,5,B0011AKQRU,"In this first of four videos/DVD's Phillipe Karl goes through his basic steps in teaching the young horse.  His emphasis is to keep the horse flexible and receptive to the aids without force.  The first part of the DVD is on the ground, longing, relaxation, and helping the horse to move naturally.  Then he explains the use of the aids of the bit and the hands and how to get the horse to be continually receptive to the bit but also in supporting himself so he is not leaning on the hands.  Karl demonstrates the ground work which includes working the horse in hand for various exercises including shoulder and haunches.  He begins to introduce the gymnastics to the horse.  In the second half of the video, Karl does mounted work using the same exercises that he did in hand and explains the moves.  However, this is not a step by step beginner video on ""how to"".  It is assumed that the viewer already knows how to ride and apply balance and aids.  It is more a lecture or even a workshop type of lesson on applying the aids and what to look for in the horse's response.  Because the horse pupil he uses in the DVD is a typical front-end heavy jumping style horse, the lessons are helpful to train the horse to find his balance and not lean on the forehand.  There is no hind end collection asked of the horse in these lessons because it introductory.

I enjoy Phillipe Karl's work because his philosophy of ""Legerete"", the Philosophy of Ease, is inseperable from the training.  Using patience, kindness, and working with the horse's mind and body, Phillipe demonstrates masterfully the art of classical dressage.  This is the beginning of the foundation of his DVD's and collection is found in his other DVD's.  I've used the techniques and training philosophy in my own training and found it made the most incredible difference in my horse's flexibility and collection and overall wellbeing.  He was able to move much more freely, naturally, and with much more collection.

The classical training is not geared towards contemporary competative dressage although many of the exercises in all his DVD's can be used for estabilishing balance and flexibility in the horse which leads to the end result of suppleness and mobility.",1200700800,32,2231,4.723514211886305
