8425936,5,B004DTLK4E,"This is a great DVD and it actually reminds me of watching the Sprout kids channel.  It features eight great episodes of eight different characters.  The characters are all appropriate for both boys and girls too so it is nice for families with both genders or kids who like variety.  The characters on this DVD also are great because not all of them have their own DVDs out that I've seen like Kipper and Roary The Racing Car.

Right now in Chicagoland we are in the midst of a blizzard so it was nice to break this DVD out and think about Spring.  All the episodes includes fun activities and get kids thinking about Springtime!  I just really love the variety and that I can please both boys with one DVD, it is also a decent length of 65 minutes.  I haven't seen a DVD with so many characters on it and for the price it is a great deal!  The entire DVD in general is great to watch because all the episodes focus on preschoolers and teach great lessons like team work, playing nice, and listening.",1296691200,,1001,4.315508021390374
