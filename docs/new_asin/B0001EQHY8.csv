8011366,3,B0001EQHY8,"I purchased this four pack for my twin 8 year old boys who play little league baseball.  For parents who have never played baseball themselves, I would say this is a great starting point.  The DVD shows professional baseball players instructing young little leaguers about the basics.  My boys unfortunately did not get too much out of the videos.  They said the DVDs didn't teach them anything I had not already talked to them about.  But at least it reiterated my instructions.",1269216000,,479,4.7926829268292686

still valuable information.
Perfect for Little League Coaches/Managers.
