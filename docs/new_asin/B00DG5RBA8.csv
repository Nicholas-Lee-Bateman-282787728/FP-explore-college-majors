5795933,1,B00DG5RBA8,"Am a 3D fan but this is truly horrible -- writing, editing and so-called narration. Good thing it's out of stock, except for the dummies like me who parted cash for it.",1404086400,11,168,4.28125
5795934,2,B00DG5RBA8,"total rip-off. boring, boring, boring...photography totally amateurish. Set included one cd recently bought as a single. Don't buy this. Not worth it. Very disappointing. Amazon ought to be ashamed selling this.",1401753600,6,211,5.838709677419355
5795935,5,B00DG5RBA8,"I pre-ordered this box set in January and it was finally delivered today, May 24th.  I will have to return it because the five documentaries inside were already purchased separately by me from Amazon over the course of time.  Unfortunately, the listing and description on Amazon for this box set does not list the titles of the documentaries inside the box, so I will list them now.  They are:  WILD AFRICA 3D, YELLOWSTONE 3D, ROCKY MOUNTAINS 3D, WORLD'S NATURE 3D, and PAPUA 3D.  So if you've already purchased these documentaries like I did, there's no need to buy this box set.  That being said,  I did enjoy these documentaries.  They are not as expensive looking as IMAX documentaries, but few nature documentaries are that well made.  However, the scenery and animals were more important to me than the slickness of the filmmaking.  The 3D is excellent so I would recommend this set if you don't already have the documentaries inside.  And you really can't beat the price for five Blu-Ray 3-D documentaries!  (P.S.  WORLD'S  NATURE 3D was my least favorite documentary in the set because, as I recall, it mainly dealt with farm animal and beasts of burden in one very small area of Europe).",1400889600,9,1196,4.770731707317073
5795936,5,B00DG5RBA8,"I just got my order for these 5 movies and have watched 2 of them. The photography is excellent quality. All panning is slow enough to avoid 3D 'breaking up' (pixelation) of the scene. The narration can be selected or you can choose 'music only'. Choosing the narration still allows many relaxating scenes of music. This is a great variety of parks across the globe, but I started with Rocky Mountain and Yellowstone national parks. Of course, living in Colorado made Rocky Mountain national park my first choice. I'll add more to my review as i watch more of the 5 3D movies in this box set.",1400803200,,592,4.542056074766355
5795937,5,B00DG5RBA8,"This Box should have 5 fascinating Blu rays , expect them very much .
I like all the movies of this company .
I am sure is worth to buy for this unique price .",1400544000,,159,3.5714285714285716
5795938,1,B00DG5RBA8,"Their video's NEVER get anything but HATE IT! (1) reviews by customers. I bought one, and signed up for 2 more on Pre-order, They all were shipped before I got around to view the 1st one.  After forcing myself to finish watching it and then reading the reviews. If I could I would have sent them all back, but by this time the 30 days had passed.  They are all crap. When you see (2D & 3-D) watch out!!!!

I got burned 3 times. Now I stick to I-Max 3-D  films and they are SUPERIOR to any thing else!!",1396483200,25,501,4.03030303030303
8592849,2,B00DG5RBA8,"Just received the box set titled FASCINATION EARTH 3D - OUR WONDERFUL PLANET.  Amazon represented this set as ""used"", which was OK to me.  But, the set was misrepresented in that it only contained three 3D Blu-ray discs and two 2D discs.  And, only one of the five belongs in the FASCINATION EARTH 3D - OUR WONDERFUL PLANET collection. Of the following five discs, (Papua: The Secret Island of the Cannibals, Rocky Mountains: The Impressive Natural Paradise, Wild Africa: An Extraordinary Journey, World's Nature: Europe's Most Beautiful Places and Yellowstone: America's Greatest Wonder), only Wild Africa: An Extraordinary Journey was present.  The other discs were just added to fill the box.  Not what I expect when purchasing 3D movies from Amazon!",1508716800,,753,5.190082644628099

8592852,1,B00DG5RBA8,"Absolute waste of money.  The only positive going for the complete set is the 3D graphics.  I have seen many nature DVD presentations, but this entire collection is low budget where most of the images displayed are close-ups of tree branches, leaves and running water; all without explanation.  There is minimal if any descriptive presentation as compared to the way David Attenborough and how he explains what you are viewing, the history of what you are viewing, evolution etc.

I kept thinking to myself, ""maybe the next 3D DVD will improve,"" but I couldn't have been more incorrect.  I would not recommend purchasing FASCINATION EARTH 3D and if you do purchase the collection, please don't say I didn't warn you.",1428883200,,716,4.933333333333334

8592858,2,B00DG5RBA8,"It awkwardly goes from long periods of showing the same shots over and a narrator talking about random and often unnecessary things. The narration is simply awful - from both and a writing and a vocal perspective. It's great that they got some of these beautiful shots in HD, but if I have to hear one more word about the butterfly fish I'm going to scream. There's no order to the episodes - they bounce back and forth, and like I said earlier: they frequently revisit things that they already discussed numerous times earlier in the episode. It is NOT worth the money and I would NOT recommend anyone wasting their time buying it.",1410393600,9,632,4.552631578947368
