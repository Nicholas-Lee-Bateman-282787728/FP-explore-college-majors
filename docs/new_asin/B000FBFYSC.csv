8120295,3,B000FBFYSC,I love History. Any sought of history of this world i love. The Earps are part of the history and is written about and had movies done on them. They were men who served as lawmen but also had there other side where they had dodgy dealings. They all had to make there money somehow. An interesting DVD.,1334534400,,301,4.206896551724138
8120296,2,B000FBFYSC,"I was very disappointed with this Biography DVD.  It is an old show, and it shows in the ebb & flow of the program.  My husband is a Earp Brothers fan and turned it off after the first 20 min's.",1292544000,3,194,3.825
8120297,4,B000FBFYSC,"I am a die hard fan of the old west, and particularly the lawmen and gunfighters.  This  was more to add to my collection of books I have already read.  I probably would not recommend this to someone only mildly interested in this genre since it is not particularly entertaining.  It does provide an overall good summary of the Earp family with photos.",1223164800,10,352,4.5396825396825395
8120298,5,B000FBFYSC,"Well folks this is it.  The real biography and better than the TV show.  He knew that he was destined for fame.  He lived his western life out and tried to tell people the real story of the West.  He had the biggest influence on WS Hart and therefore, all westerns later.  But, Hollywood kept glorifying the real story and distorting the real life of the fast draw gunfighter.  They do the same with soldiers and combat, also.  This biography of Wyatt Earp is worth every penny.
