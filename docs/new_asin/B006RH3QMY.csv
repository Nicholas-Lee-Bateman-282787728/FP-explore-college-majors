8503547,4,B006RH3QMY,"Focuses upon three families who learn that their sons died while in military service. Then comes the terrible news that possibly it was due to friendly fire. Heart-wrenching subject matter as the families share their grief and what appears to be possible cover-ups. Includes Department of Defense actual footage of military operations. Insightful.

Also includes some history of family notifications and how fire may have impacted the outcome of the Civil War. Some swearing.",1460764800,,475,5.418918918918919
8503548,5,B006RH3QMY,"Sensitively done, apparently very well-researched, and eye-opening. Sadly, there is much more to the ""friendly fire"" story than Pat Tillman.",1431302400,,140,6.05
8503549,5,B006RH3QMY,"This is an important piece that stubbornly and rightfully seeks to reinsert and important topic. We order our military to do extraordinarily dangerous, traumatic, and chaotic things. Aside from the basic ethical standard of behavior and respect that we to our citizen soldiers, we also need to maintain the stewardship of our citizen soldiers if we can hope to have the same level of military effectiveness in the future.  Our news media are just not up to the task.",1381104000,,466,4.89873417721519

8503551,5,B006RH3QMY,This movie is very touching and heartfelt to watch.  In a very respectful way the families of these fallen service men tell their agonizing stories of the aparent inability of the army to tell the whole story of their deaths due to friendly fire incidents.  The film is an absolute must see.,1338336000,2,291,4.576923076923077
8503552,5,B006RH3QMY,"Whatever you think you know about friendly fire, throw it out the window.
Granted, we all know it happens... In the very tidy way that has always been presented us, one would assume there is nothing more to tell - except for now.

The aftermath, cover-up, and lack of humanity exposed in this documentary dispel the illusion in a raw and factual presentation that leaves the viewer without the answers we are accustomed. We are left instead with compelling questions, an unsettled mind, and a place where empathy becomes sympathy. To what end and purpose are these actions taken? How is this justifiable? Who is accountable? These are just some of the reoccurring questions that plague the families of our lost and are now brought before us in 'A Second Knock at the Door' with the only answer being, ""there is none"".",1330992000,5,817,4.753521126760563
8503553,5,B006RH3QMY,"I believe that every American should see this Documentary!!!  Everyone understands that bad things happen in war and are unavoidable, but the families of these men and women, whose stories are told in this very well done documentary, should be told the truth as soon possible. That is the very least they deserve for their sacrifices.  It is unacceptable that they are not.  I congratulate Christopher Grimes and his entire company for telling these families stories so eloquently!!!",1329955200,3,483,5.166666666666667
8503554,5,B006RH3QMY,"There are so many reasons to see ""A Second Knock At The Door.""  It tells an important truth, no matter how heart-breaking the stories of the families are.  The way the story is told allows each person to come to a conclusion based on facts and the truth.  There is no sensationalism. It doesn't steer you. It takes you through facts, real footage and introduces you to real families who experienced friendly-fire and lost a loved one.  All sides are presented fairly and objectively.  Of course, I had an emotional response to the fact that US soldiers are and have been killed by other US troops.  The way the families were told and treated was not acceptable and this documentary will surely prevent other families from the double heartbreak the families in the documentary went through.  You feel that both issues; friendly-fire and how families are notified are addressed.  If you support our troops, you have to see this. If you are against war, you have to see this.  Everyone needs to see this.  It's about real people and real families and a system that needs change. I was riveted from beginning to end.  I felt real heartache watching the families.  And I am glad I know what the families went through; these soldiers were proud to serve our country. Their families supported them and felt proud too.  They did not deserve what happened and I hope they get closure from this documentary. I hope the system changes.  Really well done.",1329955200,6,1443,4.697211155378486
