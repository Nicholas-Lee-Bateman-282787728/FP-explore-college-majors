8401719,1,B003OUXHIA,Not at all what the description sells.  This is essentially a home video.,1413763200,,73,4.615384615384615
8401720,1,B003OUXHIA,This wasn't very good at all. It was just a homemade video of someone riding in a car. It was shaky and very hard to watch.,1397952000,,123,3.769230769230769
8401721,1,B003OUXHIA,"The one good review is by the guy that made the video. Enough said. As a native New Orleanian I naturally have strong feelings about Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent federal levee failures, so I really wish Amazon would pull this from the website.",1362096000,2,251,4.7272727272727275
8401722,2,B003OUXHIA,"I purchased this as a video-on-demand and it was not until I began viewing it that I noticed the poor quality. I didn't (but should have) read the only review first, as I incorrectly (and hurriedly) *assumed* this was another professionally produced video. MY FAULT if I failed to read something that would have communicated this. Had I known that this was a home video, my expectations would have been more realistic.

I have a tender heart for folk who have suffered devastating, life-changing events and believe it's important to show compassion and have patience. So for at least the first half of the video, I endured the lengthy, monotone monologue, poor quality film, etc., since it's better to focus on matters of the heart (the spirit) and not be so legalistic, critical, and judgmental about technicalities.

Having said that, I was disappointed that the beginning of the video appeared to be lengthy monologues by Mr. Walker. Then there was the longest, monotonous sequence of homes, taken from the passenger side of a car, that seemed to go and on: on the same strip, same camera angle, with the occasional distraction of being able to see the side view mirror. There were other scenes that overused water bubbles/ripples to transition between still shots. After being taken through Mr. Walker's property five years later, the video abruptly transitions to [what I'm left to guess is] Hurricane Katrina footage--a voice over explanation would have been nice. More importantly, it would have been better shown at the *beginning* which would have given the viewer a better chronology. The ending is also incongruous with the rest of the video. Greater variety in the music and smoother transitions might have enhanced the visuals. It was NOT ""An impressive soundtrack..."" as asserted in the Plot Outline.

 To Mr. Walker: God bless you for your efforts, and I hope you have been able to battle your way through all the SBA and FEMA bureaucracies...allowing you to hold onto and complete the repairs to your properties.",1292371200,3,2028,4.991124260355029
8401723,1,B003OUXHIA,"I recently purchased this DVD. I found the production values to be amateurish at best terrible at worst.  Additionally, the dialogue was sophomoric and boring. After watching this video, my wife and I decided to send it out with the trash.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.",1284249600,6,257,4.818181818181818
