7448447,4,B015S4DRH0,"The film is fast moving, well acted, very competently directed, and well written. You do root for the classic archetype that Affleck plays that only exist in movies -- the principled criminal with a romantic soft side.

The action scenes are well shot, with great nuances thrown in to the mix for tense and surprisingly hilarious effect.

The only thing I did not buy is just how soft Afflect's character gets toward the end. The ending is straight out of some romance novel. I did not expect that at all, especially since this film wants so badly to be gritty and rough.

The extras in this BD edition are great especially if you are fan of this film. The making-of feature is very insightful. It's surprising what a good mainstream director Ben Affleck has turned out to be (he surprised me, anyway). He is not a visionary filmmaker, or artsy in any way, but he is very functional and direct. He sheds all visual styles in favor of telling tight, well-told stories.",1475452800,2,967,4.6104651162790695

8734483,3,B015S4DRH0,"I find the story a bit contrived insofasr as the likelihood of a bank robber finding and dating the bank manager of the last bank he and his cohorts robbed, taking said manager hostage for a bit. Some good scenes otherwise though.  .",1512086400,,233,4.4186046511627906

8734485,5,B015S4DRH0,Loved the theatrical version that I've scene a few times news but want to see the extended cut. It's nearly 30 minutes longer and has a lot more character developement and grit to it. Amazon warehouse did it again saving me a few bucks on this one too. When they say that a product is like new they aren't kidding. Buying through them has saved me money on countless occasions.,1501545600,,377,4.4
