8428660,2,B004GEB6J0,"I've followed the Residents for years, and even attended a couple of live shows.  While there's plenty of Residents' weirdness here, it's just not quite enough-- the ""stories"" are all excruciatingly slow-moving and anticlimactic.  And the accompanying music leaves something to be desired as well for the most part.  I certainly wouldn't subject anyone who isn't a hardcore fan to this, if it doesn't just weird them out it'll bore them silly.  And even the hardcore fans will likely be disappointed I'm afraid.  I'd think they're capable of much better.",1417046400,,554,5.111111111111111
8428661,5,B004GEB6J0,Even if you are not a residents fan or know little about them this is a uniquely spooky and disturbing collection of vignettes for any and all freaks out there,1395878400,,159,4.333333333333333
