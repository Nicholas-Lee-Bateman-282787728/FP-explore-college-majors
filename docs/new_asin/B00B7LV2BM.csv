8563654,5,B00B7LV2BM,"As a personal friend of Hughie's here in Tampa I could not agree more with the other reviews. Note that the audio and video is just okay. But that is not why you buy this. You buy it because what the band means to you. I am 64 now and first met them when I was 17.  Hughie is with out a doubt one of the best guitarists to ever pick up an axe. One of the sad things is that Billy Jones was also a fantastic guitar player but depression (drugs/booze) took hold and he took his own life. Of the original Outlaws only Henry Paul and Monte Yoho are still alive. R.I.P. Hughie, Billy and Frank.",1528416000,,589,3.9915254237288136

But more great stuff follows this, and interesting to see them at various points in time.  Loved the interview with Hughie.  So glad these Outlaws treasures are being made available to the public!",1414454400,,419,4.712328767123288
