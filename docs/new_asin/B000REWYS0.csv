2864810,5,B000REWYS0,"Wonderful old ""who-done-it.""  The basis for a Mr. Wong (Boris Karloff) film.  I especially enjoyed the interior turn-of-the-century set pieces.  Well done.",1423008000,,155,5.954545454545454
2864811,2,B000REWYS0,"The later remake in the Mr. Wong movies is much better. In this one the picture is bad, the sound good. This movie is not worth buying unless you can find one that is a well done remake of the master copy. It would take a lot of skill to make a good copy of this DVD. The better movie is the Mr. Wong movie.",1384300800,,307,3.7384615384615385
2864812,4,B000REWYS0,"My review is for the ALPHA version that also features the Moonstone.  The picture and sound were acceptabale for this SOLID murder mystery.  But it requires a bit of patientce as the actors are rather stiff and the film is slow moving.  As a story it is first rate, and if you are patient you will be rewarded.",1372982400,6,310,4.310344827586207
2864813,5,B000REWYS0,This is a very rare Old Dark House B Movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great on a Dark and Stormy Night!!!,1196294400,9,119,3.6153846153846154
2864814,1,B000REWYS0,"Got this one because of my affinity for 1930s old dark house mysteries.  The film is typical for one of those, from the early 1930s.  The disc, however, is pretty bad.  First, it is a DVD-R....that in and of itself isn't necessarily bad if it weren't for the asking price of $10.  The transfer of the movie has terrible contrast, is very dupey with soft focus.  The disc has no main menu and no chapter stops.  If you can get this title for $1, it might be worth it.",1182124800,4,466,4.179775280898877
2864845,3,B000REWYS0,Well acted and good story line.  I love old movies this one was not great but good enough so that I don't feel that my time was wasted.,1475625600,,135,3.8214285714285716
2864846,4,B000REWYS0,"A good movie.  Gave four stars only;  it did not warrant more.  But I think that is because they did not know the importance of a good musical score then and the edit and speech is  abrupt and predictable in places.  However, if you like black and white movies and appreciate a good story then I think you will still enjoy the mystery.",1475020800,,335,4.253968253968254
2864847,5,B000REWYS0,Interesting old movie.,1474675200,,22,6.666666666666667
2864848,1,B000REWYS0,My passion is old mystery movies from the '30's and 40's but this one is a real looser. Don't even bother. It's downright silly.,1474588800,,128,4.375
2864849,5,B000REWYS0,Streamed video online.  Old and scratchy and a wonderfully surprising end.,1474070400,,74,5.7272727272727275
2864850,3,B000REWYS0,"Nice little murder mystery. Another viewer described it as ""campy"" and I would agree with that. Not bad for its time and only about an hour long.",1470355200,,145,4.407407407407407
2864851,2,B000REWYS0,This is so far removed from today's world that it made me laugh. It's so funny but it's a murder! I think it's a good way actually to see these oldies.,1469923200,,151,3.903225806451613
2864852,1,B000REWYS0,Horribly caricatured. No nuances or sophistication - much in the line of the old exaggerated acting..,1469836800,,101,5.375

2864854,4,B000REWYS0,I would say 6.5/10. The ending was surprising and not anticipated.,1468800000,,66,5.090909090909091

2864874,5,B000REWYS0,"Murder at Midnight, 1931 film

A man adjusts the minute hand on a clock so it sounds midnight. We hear thunder and see lightning. A man sneaks into the house. A woman comes to see him. Her husband catches then and shoots the intruder dead. We hear applause, Its all a game of charades! But the man who was shot is really dead. Who put real bullets in the revolver? Who called the police before the shot? Inspector Taylor questions the witnesses. ""I thought it was you."" Then another shot is heard; it's the second body. Mr. Kennedy is shot dead too. Murder-suicide? The people there know little, but one of them is the murderer. Mrs. Kennedy has no suspicions. The maid Millie answers questions about Grayson. Mr. Colton is questioned about their quarrel over a new will. Police are stationed on each floor. Can they be lured away?

Maid Millie calls for Inspector Taylor, she may have news. But Millie will not talk to the police when they arrive. Her room was disturbed by a search for the missing will and letter. Did she want to marry Walter Grayson? Lawrence the butler cleans the rug with a vacuum cleaner. Will he find a letter? Lawrence will not talk to the police when they arrive. ""Its his day off."" Nobody was in the house. The phone is dead too. ""This isn't a murder case, its an epidemic."" Who put blanks in Aunt Julia's pistol? The police search all the rooms for evidence. Will Julia discover the hiding place of that letter? Can she deliver it to Philip Montrose, the criminologist? Then the telephone rings! Inspector Taylor talks to Aunt Julia and gets the letter. Philip Montrose takes the telephone to provide an answer to the mystery. Aunt Julia gets the last sarcastic word.

In spite of a low budget, this is a clever story with an unexpected twist at the end. As the bodies fall, who else is left?",1466553600,,1821,4.52887537993921
2864875,4,B000REWYS0,"Great mystery with lots of plot misdirection and wit, although at times it borders on campy. I do not mind the ""sound"" of these older films as some seem to do. For me, it's just part of their charm. All in all, a fine film.",1465948800,4,223,3.977777777777778
2864876,5,B000REWYS0,Good movie,1465430400,,10,4.5

8200140,5,B000REWYS0,Great movie.,1499472000,,12,5.5
8200141,3,B000REWYS0,"Unfortunately, this 1931 movie did not transfer as well as others I have from this same general time frame.  It's watchable but I did find the video and audio to be a little challenging.  The premise is great of a ""pretend"" murder play at a party that actual ends up being a real murder in front of a room full of witnesses.  However, this similar story is much more watchable in the Boris Karloff ""Mr. Wong"" movie series under the title of ""The Mystery of Mr. Wong"" from 1939.  I really enjoy these old murder mystery movies but this one, again, just did not seem to transfer as well to DVD as others of this era.  Good effort, though!",1487030400,,636,4.310924369747899
8200142,4,B000REWYS0,Typical 1930's mystery movie - it kept my interest.,1486166400,,51,4.777777777777778
8200143,4,B000REWYS0,"Though the pacing was slow and some of the acting was ham-fisted, I enjoyed this murder mystery with a plot twist.",1485475200,,114,4.476190476190476
8200144,1,B000REWYS0,"The movie was not good quality, very low budget.",1484179200,,48,4.444444444444445
8200145,5,B000REWYS0,I like the old film nor type movier. The  old shows have style we no longer see in most of the movies of today.,1481846400,,111,3.625
8200146,1,B000REWYS0,"Too old, poor quality video",1479168000,,27,4.6
8200147,1,B000REWYS0,"DO NOT buy ""The Film Detective Restored Classics"" version of this transfer-to-DVD unless you are an afficionado of technological incompetence and dreck!

The only way this DVD could be worse would be for it to be blank;  ALL efforts were spared in the production of this product.  It will play only on SOME, not all, DVD players.  On my Blu-ray player it was a psychedelic display of pixelated images with no sound.  On my OLD laptop and DVD player it played.  There are no ""niceties"" like a menu, chapters, or subtitles.  The pirates who produce these products don't know what those words mean.

If you are looking for a GOOD version of ""Murder at Midnight,"" this ain't it!",1478908800,,674,4.6525423728813555
8200148,4,B000REWYS0,I've seen another version of this with some of the same actors and actresses which was a tinge better.  But I loved the story line and the acting.  Would recommend this for anyone who loves a good mystery!,1478649600,,205,4.368421052631579
