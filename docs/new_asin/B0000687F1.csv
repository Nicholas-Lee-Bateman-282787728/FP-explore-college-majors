7963948,3,B0000687F1,"One of the oddities in the history of Japanese animation is that two strikingly similar comedy/horror animes came out almost at the same time in the early 90s.  So how do they compare?

Ghost Sweeper Mikami was the first to come out, consisting of a 45 episode TV series (1993-1994) (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Sweeper-Mikami-Collection-1/dp/B004047XVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Sweeper Mikami Collection 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Sweeper-Mikami-Collection-2/dp/B0048EAYPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Sweeper Mikami Collection 2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Sweeper-Mikami-Collection-3/dp/B004FZWDSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Sweeper Mikami Collection 3</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Sweeper-Mikami-Collection-4/dp/B004ODLUJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Sweeper Mikami Collection 4</a>), followed by an hour long movie ""Ghost Sweeper Mikami"" (1994).  The writing is fairly clever, if perhaps a bit overdone in the wacky humor department, and seems to get even better as the series rolls along (including TWO wacky Christmas episodes, a crazy New Years episode, and a wild Valentines Day episode).  In addition the large cast of characters is very interesting; however, I was surprised at the unexpectedly poor condition of the print of the TV series.  It is less than a quarter century old, but you will notice fairly frequent dirt in the print.

Note: There is no English voice acting version of the TV series (unlike the movie), only English subtitles.

In contrast the movie was something of a disappointment.  At only 60 minutes long it seemed more like yet another of the two episode stories the TV series had done fairly often, and this was not one of the best of them.  The animation (by the same company, Toei) was somewhat different (more 3D looking) but noticeably not an improvement.  In fact about the only improvement this has even for American viewers is the addition of an English voice acting track to the English subtitles track, but there is nothing special or memorable about it.  Frankly, I cannot help but wonder if this didn't kill the whole series dead in Japan; the movie ends with Reiko Mikami shouting, See you next time!, but there was no next time.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantom-Quest-Corp/dp/B00004Y9PW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantom Quest Corp.</a>&nbsp;(1994-1995) was the second to come out, and having never heard of it before I watched it, Im a little surprised because there is a lot to like about it.  First, because it is an OVA and it is from Madhouse, the animation is a good deal better than you might have expected (frankly, a good deal better looking than the animation in Ghost Sweeper Mikami IMHO), but the most impressive thing about it is the writing!  Ive seen a lot of comedy/horror in my time, but this thing amazed me: every single episode was a complete surprise!  Even the opening credits, showing scenes of (arguably because of the series truncation) never to be seen adventures left me wanting to see more, but, alas, 4 OVA episodes are all that was made.  The one negative Id note is that in these 4 episodes, of the 6 main characters, not a single change is noted.  They start and end the series exactly the same.

Note: For reasons unclear this does not include the Incident File 00 episode, which was little more than a promotional item for the anime, but why it wasn't included on the DVD is beyond me, since it was apparently released over here earlier by Pioneer on VHS!  It consists of about half cast interviews, but about half is animated chibi introductions to the plot and the characters, which given how little of this was actually done in the four episodes we do have, is greatly appreciated.  Definitely worth seeking out and watching online.

Note: Though the English voice acting is fairly good, because of the complex subject matter, Id advise going with the Japanese with English subtitles first for better understanding of the surprisingly complex plots.

Note: Three non-anime items worth noting are a single issue English comic from March of 1997&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantom-Quest-Corp-1-The-Howling-Book/dp/B000KSOWFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantom Quest Corp. #1 - The Howling Book</a>, containing the beginnings of an entirely new adventure in NYC (it was never finished), and 2 CDs: a 12-track CD released in 1994 in Japan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Gen-Kai-Sya/dp/B00005FXQN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Gen Kai Sya</a>, with only an outer sticker in English and an 11-track CD released in 1997 in North America,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-Phantom-Quest-Corp/dp/B00000FXVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of Phantom Quest Corp.</a>, with both English and Japanese songs and a booklet in English.

Note: Weirdly, perhaps because everything was originally intended for TV showing, the only female breast baring I noticed in either series was in the first episode of the Ghost Sweeper Mikami TV series, an oddity in itself.

So, what of the comparison?  Well, clearly Ghost Sweeper Mikami was the more successful of the two, with a 45 episode TV series, plus a 60 minute movie versus a 4 episode OVA series, plus the Incident File 00 episode; however, Id have to say that Phantom Quest Corp. was the better animated and the better written.  Too bad it wasn't longer in part because it definitely had the more likable characters.  Meanwhile Ghost Sweeper Mikami is somewhat handicapped IMHO by the unattractiveness of the two main characters: Reiko Mikami is motivated to a disturbing degree purely by greed, and Tadao Yokoshima is too much of the classic Japanese lust-filled, cowardly idiot.  Perhaps the best way of saying this is to note that Ghost Sweeper Mikami the anime basically covers the first 9 volumes of a 39 volume manga, and while Id certainly watch more if it was available, I don't really mind the fact that it is not, but in contrast I sorely miss not having anymore of Phantom Quest Corp. to watch, read, or even listen to the music of.",1525392000,,6396,5.8705501618122975
7963949,4,B0000687F1,"I grew up watching GS Mikami subbed to mexican spanish (uncensored to boot) but sadly they never dubbed the movie. Oddly enough the US at the time was in the opposite position, they had the movie dubbed for quite a while but not the tv serues (seems like someone finally dubbed to 45 episode tv series).

The movie is hilarious, filled with the ecchiness from the tv series and Mikami's relentless greed. There is a lot of action but it tries to remain funny, and Emi's defective voodoo magic is given a chance to shine for once. I liked both tracks, both the English and the original Japanese version.",1482019200,,602,4.522935779816514
7963950,5,B0000687F1,"I do have this film on DVD along with its Japanese TV series, it is funny, silly, sexy and scary. It's like watching the 1980's THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS, but Ghost Sweeper Mikami is influenced by the GHOSTBUSTERS. I recommend this to young adults, because this is not really for young kids to watch, it has screwball relationship between Yokoshima and Mikami, just when Yokoshima grabs a whole of Mikami's breast and takes her underwear.",1404691200,,434,4.878378378378378
7963951,5,B0000687F1,"The dvd is is great condition. No scratches and it does not skip. This a a must see for anyone who loves a combination of paranormal ghost and monster hunting that is sort of a parady of Buffy the vampire slayer. FYI there is also a tv series that this movie is based on and is coming to america for the first this November! Unfortunatly, the tv series is only in its japanese dub, just to let you know.",1286668800,,403,4.113924050632911
7963952,4,B0000687F1,"This item is mislabeled. ""Ghost Sweeper Mikami (Vol. 1)"" implies that it is the first volume of the Ghost Sweeper Mikami TV series, it is not. It is the 60 minute movie/OVA Ghost Sweeper Mikami: The Ultmate Vampire Slayer! which based off of the TV Series. As it turns out, the TV series was never dubbed in english. Don't get me worng, I still enjoyed the movie, it just that some people would be confused by the title. That aside, I fond it very funny, just like the book series it was originally based on. Even though it's not what I was expecting, I'm still going to keep it. Maybe one day Manga will dubbed the TV series.",1257033600,,626,4.313559322033898
7963953,3,B0000687F1,"Wow.  The fact that this rather muddled and non-representative OVA is the only Ghost Sweeper Mikami entry to make its way to our shores is nothing less than criminal.  It's like putting out the Sailor Moon OVA/movies...and none of the series.  Or the Fushigi Yuugi OVAs...and not the series.  Or the Magic Knight Rayearth OVAs...and neither of the series.  In other words, quite possibly the stupidest marketing decision EVER in the history of anime.  It's almost like they were TRYING to sabotage acceptance of the series over here - put out the worst, least representative thing ever associated with the series, and when it tanks, oh well, we can say we tried!

All I can say about this is somebody, please wake up and bring over the Ghost Sweeper Mikami series.  It's funny, cute, and has some endearing characters (Okinu in particular).  This OVA/movie is just a mess.",1254096000,2,872,4.837837837837838
7963954,3,B0000687F1,"If you have not seen at least a few episodes of the TV series it you may not enjoy this movie since it is set at the end of the series. There is no introduction to the charactors since it is expected you know them from watching the series. It's too bad that non of the TV series has been released in R1.
Note: The english track has had all of the music replaced, and music has been added where there is non in the original. The Japanese track has not been changed.",1028419200,6,464,4.0
7963955,3,B0000687F1,"I first watched ""Ghost Sweeper Mikami"" back in 1994 and the first episodes of the TV series were humorous and I enjoyed it a lot.
The television series introduced a a money loving ghost-demon-vamprie hunter named Mikami and in each episode we get to know more about her and each member of her team that joins her for each case.
This is what I enjoyed about the television series is the fact that you got a chance to grow with the characters and fully enjoy the series because it is a humorous series and quite fun.
Almost a decade later, the DVD of the series is finally released in the US but not the release that I was expecting.
""Ghost Sweeper Mikami"" features the final two episodes of the anime television series and what I enjoyed the series for, the ability to grow and enjoy the characters has been removed from this series.
What you see is a group of people assisting Mikami going against Nosferatu. No one knows about the other characters and why they act the way they do and thus my feeling is that people who watch this are not really going to get it.
Hopefully Manga Entertainment will plan to release the series on DVD but with the final two TV episodes combined to make like a movie, just doesn't seem right without the proper background knowledge of the characters. Without it, you can't really appreciate this anime.
As for the DVD, since this was a TV series based in the early 90's, you can't expect top notch anime compared to movies or OAV's but you get to watch a series created by cels instead of the typical comptuer animation used in anime today.
As for audio, the digital 5.1 has an awesome track but since I'm a Japanese language purists, I rather watch the series in that format via English subtitles but I did switch time from time to hear the 5.1 track which was really good.
As for special features, there's a photo gallery and character bio information and of course the typical Manga trailers they include on every DVD.
All in all ""Ghost Sweeper Mikami"" is a great series that was intended for people to watch the television series and enjoy the character development with each episode not by skipping to the final two episodes of the TV series and then enjoying it from there. It just doesn't seem right. The series is quite entertaining but to watch the final two episodes, I'm not sure if the viewer who hasn't watched the previous episodes can truly enjoy or appreciate this entertaining series.",1025395200,10,2432,4.542141230068337
