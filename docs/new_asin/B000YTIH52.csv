8234056,4,B000YTIH52,"The 15 titles on this EAST SIDE KID collection have long been available on many budget label DVD and VHS brands. As with other ""East Side"" offerings, these are dubbed from unrestored 16 mm broadcast films. Quality is fair to good, none are pristine.

The East Siders featured several actors who appeared in the WARNER Dead End films and UNIVERSAL's Little Tough Guy series. Some would later continue with MONOGRAM's classic Bowery Boys programmers. There were 22 MONOGRAM East Side Kids pictures made between 1940 and '45, including an initial movie that had only two supporting players of the core Little Tough Guy gang.

The Kids: Leo Gorcey (2,3,4,6,7,8,10,11,13,14,16); Bobby Jordan (2,3,4,6,7,8,10,11,13,14); Ernest Morrison (2,3,4,6,7,8,10,11,13,14); Huntz Hall (6,7,8,10,11,13,14,16); David Gorcey (1,2,3,4,6,7,8,10); Bobby Stone (2,6,8,10,11,14,16); Donald Haines (1,2,3,6,7); Stanley Clements (10,11,14); 'Billy' Benedict (13,14,16); Eugene Francis (2,3,4); Hal E. Chester (1,2); Frankie Burke (1,2); Vince Barnett (1,2)

8234057,4,B000YTIH52,"I have read other reviews that the video quality is not very good.  While that is true, it is as good as it was when they were originally filmed in the 1930s.  I am very satisfied with the movies.  I grew up watching the East Side Kids as a kid myself.  It is still good, wholesome viewing.  Audio is very good too, given the age of the films.",1268697600,14,343,3.985294117647059
