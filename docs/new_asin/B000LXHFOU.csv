8165279,1,B000LXHFOU,"To start off, it's a horrible print but I supposed that's to be expected from an old obscurity like this.
It's pretty laughable but worth it if you want to see Shemp Howard play a tough guy.",1402617600,,190,4.162162162162162
8165280,2,B000LXHFOU,"""Convention Girl"" is an interesting little movie about a Depression-era call girl (they call themselves ""hostesses"" in the film) who has basically given up on finding happiness with a guy who isn't ""in the rackets."" Also, she's fed up with having to deal with all the ""Good Time Charlies"" who stream through Atlantic City with endless conventions. One such group being the ""Electric Washing Machine"" salesmen's convention, which consists mainly of pudgy old guys with bad toupees.

One big shortcoming of this film is the fact that it was shot on location in Atlantic City, but very little of the boardwalk attractions are shown. Out of the almost 70 minutes running time, only about 10 minutes center around the fun, carnival-like attractions of that era.

I would have given this film a three star rating, except for the dismal quality of the DVD itself. The picture and sound are awful. The picture is often out of focus, and goes from washed out to too dark. Then the sound of the film is very low, muffled, and flat. Turning up the sound on your TV to full volumne and then having to stain to make out the dialogue is the only way to get through this film. The whole experience is hardly worth it.

Once again, Alpha has put more time and effort into designing a pretty, colorful DVD case, and what appears to be little time in the presentation of a watchable movie inside the case. This is sad, considering that so many film fans depend on Alpha for a steady diet of hard-to-find movies.",1315180800,,1493,4.626415094339623
8165281,2,B000LXHFOU,"This was an interesting B movie but the print used is really bad.  Lighting levels jump from bright to so dark you cannot see the actors.  In the first twenty minutes of the film almost every scene would run about 5 seconds and then start over again.

Shemp Howard's part is over blown as he is only on camera for a few minutes but it was interesting to see him as a bad guy and not the Stooge I've always known him.

There was an interesting set of scenes at the boardwalk showing some of the attractions from the mid-30's in Atlantic City, NJ.  These and the other shots showing life at the resort city were the best reasons to watch this film.",1298505600,,646,4.219512195121951
8165282,3,B000LXHFOU,"A representative attempt of its period at sentimental realism, this Falcon Pictures Corporation production, made by Reel Enterprises, a Great Depression era Poverty Row studio, features Rose Hobart as Cynthia ""Babe"" Laval, a worldweary lady of the evening and procuress who has secured a virtual monopoly on call girls in Atlantic City, where most of this film was shot, all while her quest for true romantic love forms the nub of the work.  Babe plays Cupid for her rounded heel charges during sales conventions and for this story it is a convocation of washing machine company representatives where it appears that Babe may have chanced upon her dream man, perhaps the best of her recent prospects, a cultured middleaged soap industry nabob, Wade Hollister (Herbert Rawlinson), who patently returns Babe's ardour as the two develop an impassioned relationship.  This mutual attraction is most unpleasant to Babe's former swain, Bill Bradley (Weldon Heyburn), whose aggressive wooing of her has been unavailing because Bill owns and operates an illegal gambling joint and after she plainly seems to prefer Ward's more respectable background, Bradley discovers that he is out of her future plans and the setting is created for a clash between the suitors.  Those viewers interested in United States social and cultural history will have a whale of a time watching well-selected plot incorporated footage of the era's Atlantic City Boardwalk, including scenes of acrobats, the famous Diving Horse at Steel Pier, vast crowded beaches, and the still popular wicker rolling chairs, all nicely integrated into a scenario that has little enough weight of its own to carry a narrative forward.  Released also as ATLANTIC CITY ROMANCE, the affair offers some pleasing musical interludes, notably vocal solos by Ruth Gillette and pert Nancy Kelly, each accompanied by Isham Jones and his dance orchestra (an alert viewer can spot Woody Herman as a sideman, playing alto saxophone).  Despite a featherweight plotline that might well have used a trifle more wit, and a screenplay that emphasizes a key plot device of blackmail, with its target being a lady of the evening whose portion takes in an attempted murder of her younger brother, a pleasant tone has ousted any potential emphasis upon the distasteful, aided greatly by a solid supporting cast; acting laurels must go to talented Hobart.  Reissued upon an Alpha Entertainment DVD that, as is customary with that company, lacks any extra features or much needed remastering, the film as a result has only indifferent audio quality and merely adequate visual reproduction, although there is but a minimum of excisions.",1215907200,,2663,5.224824355971897
