8232083,4,B000YDKALW,"""The Whispering Shadow"" is a 12-chapter Mascot serial released in 1933, directed by Albert Herman and Colbert Clark.  Albert Herman directed the two later Weiss serials ""The Clutching Hand"" and ""The Black Coin,"" and also quite a few of Mickey Rooney's early comedies, which may have had some influence here.

Empire Transport and Storage Company, a world-wide operation, has had several of their trucks attacked by the mysterious ""Whispering Shadow"" especially when moving exhibits to the wax museum of Professor Strang (Bela Lugosi).  Traffic Controller Jack Foster (Malcolm McGregor) reluctantly lets his kid brother Buddy (George J. Lewis) drive the latest such shipment, but when radio dispatcher Sparks (Karl Dane) can't contact the truck, it isn't long before the Whispering Shadow's image appears and his agents attack, killing Buddy.  One of the Shadow's agents is captured, but dies mysteriously at Police headquarters, just as he is about to talk.  A small device is found by detective Robert Raymond (Robert Warwick), a ""death disk"" also used to communicate orders.  Raymond is hired by Empire Transport to investigate, and with help from Jack Foster they uncover a plot that could only be that of a Mascot serial, with most of the cast members trying to get the Crown Jewels of the Czar, believed hidden somewhere in the Empire Transport warehouse.

In addition to Strang, who is aided by his daughter, Vera (Viva Tattersall), the main suspects of being the Whispering Shadow are radio engineer Alexis Steinbeck (Roy D'Arcy) and company vice-president Jerome (Lafe McKee), both of whom, like Strang, have access to television equipment, though president Bradley (Henry B. Walthall) also seems to know more than he is telling, as does W. B. Jarvis (Lionel Backus), a company employee of very questionable loyalties.  The search is complicated by recently-escaped convict Jasper Slade (Bob Kortman), who had stolen the jewels originally.  The Whispering Shadow's agents include actors known from other serials, Jack Perrin, George Magrill, Tom London and Lloyd Whitlock.  Roy D'Arcy seems to be competing with Lugosi for most-over-the-top performance, but it never descends to all-out comedy; the plot is always assumed to be serious.  Karl Dane, in his last film appearance, does quite well with a traditional ""comic relief"" role.  While Malcolm McGregor's acting abilities are not great, he is believable as the ""action"" hero, and we have the chapter introductions to tell us he is in love with Vera Strang.  And Viva Tattersall as Vera gets directly into the plot, giving good support to whatever it is that her mysterious father is after.  Robert Warwick is fine as Detective Raymond, but isn't a major part of the action.  The budget required all suspects to use the same type of ""television machine,"" and no, the voice doesn't help in guessing the Whispering Shadow's identity; the television process seems to remove any foreign accents.  There are the usual 1930's concepts of television, such as tuning in on conversations without benefit of a camera.  Special effects are often not good, the autogyro crashing into the antenna atop the Empire warehouse at the end of the first chapter being especially tacky, and also in that chapter some of Professor Strang's animated wax exhibits are shown to have remarkable flexibility.  And the Jewels of the Czar are never seen in any detail.  But the settings are believable and most of the action scenes are good.  While there is a remarkable amount of ""retrospective"" footage, it is used quite well in the last chapter to explain the actions of several suspects and to identify the Whispering Shadow.

Alpha's edition is in two volumes, ALP 4306D and 4307D, or both volumes shrinkwrapped as 9550D.  For an Alpha release it is quite good.  The image is reasonably sharp, some chapters a bit high in contrast and others showing some wear and tear in the form of scratches, but facial features don't completely wash out.  The framing is adequate, though in a couple chapters the bottom line of the introductory text gets partially clipped off.  The last half of Chapter Two has videotape mistracking near the top of the screen, causing a vertical jitter, but no problems of that kind in the rest of the serial.  The sound quality varies, but it is clear enough, no trouble with distortion and is only wheezy in a few places.  There are a couple short pieces missing, including a humorous one seen in another edition of the second chapter, where the convict Slade is sneaking up on the supposedly-sleeping Vera with a knife, and then is shown with a very puzzled expression on his face, holding a dismembered arm of a mannequin.  Such omissions are unfortunate but not unusual in existing prints of Mascot serials, and Alpha's edition is reasonably complete.  It was also released at a time when Alpha did not put their logo on-screen during the credits.

For those accustomed to early sound serials ""The Whispering Shadow"" is quite entertaining, but needs to be taken one chapter at a time, with a day or more between them.  It is a crashing bore if watched straight-through; the chapters contain much ""retrospective"" material and the plot devices are repetitive.  A ""feature"" version was made from the chapters, not to be confused with Lugosi's later ""Murder by Television,"" and while not bad for those who want to see the story in one sitting, it loses a lot of the atmosphere and glorious overacting of the full serial.",1324771200,9,5481,5.028761061946903
8232084,5,B000YDKALW,"I love this movie. I love anything with Bela Lugosi - an extremely gifted actor who came before his time.
  The serial itself is somewhat confusing at times, trying to create a ""whodunit"" atmosphere, but I love
  Bela in anything that he does,so.....The stunts are great, especially considering the time period, and
  there are special effects, and ""James Bond"" gadgets= Definitely something for everyone! And if you are
  a Bela Lugosi fan, just having him in the movie is enough.",1280966400,2,481,4.925
8232085,1,B000YDKALW,"Bela Lugosi fans will have difficulty sitting through this amateurish Mascot serial. ""The Whispering Shadow"" (1933) is not even good for laughs. Since Mascot spent most of its budget on Lugosi's salary, the production values are nonexistent. Poor Bela is wasted in a typical red herring role. Cheap, cheap, cheap!",1208563200,14,313,5.28
