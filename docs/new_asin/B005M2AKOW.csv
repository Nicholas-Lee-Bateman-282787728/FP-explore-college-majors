4833968,5,B005M2AKOW,"Morse is always entertaining, if a bit morose!  Poor thing. Great story without too much personal stuff..it's there, but in the background and not intrusive.",1354579200,,157,5.28
4833969,5,B005M2AKOW,"I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.

Set Nine contains three episodes:
Cherubim and Seraphim
Frankly, this is not one of my favorite Morse episodes. It is slow and drags on, yet worth watching for several reasons.

First, this is one of the rare episodes that provides viewers with an insight into Morse's early life. At the beginning of the episode, we see Morse and two women who later turn out to be related to him. We learn that Morse's parents were divorced when he was young, and that he went to live with his father at the age of fifteen, and had to put up with an indifferent stepmother who hated him, and still does. We also learn some other shocking aspects about Morse's early life, facts which he reveals to DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) over a pint. This episode also shows viewers how truly close Morse and Lewis are, and how much Morse trusts Lewis as evidenced in his private revelations.

Second, this episode shows viewers the lifestyle of troubled teens of the 80s - how disconnected some of them are from their parents; their interest in alternative music (in one scene, Morse is horrified when he discovers classical music has been distorted in a fusion of old and new); their secret gatherings in secluded locations, listening to underground bands and such; and teen suicide.

Even though the story itself seems choppy in places and drags on, I think this is worth watching, though it is far down my list of must-watch Morse episodes.

Deadly Slumber

Deadly Slumber is a skillfully-plotted crime story involving the murder of a renowned doctor, who together with his wife, runs a famous clinic. At first, the doctor's death appears to be suicide, but soon enough, the post-mortem reveals that the doctor was murdered. There are several suspects, the most prominent being rich businessman Michael Steppings (Brian Cox) whose young daughter Avril suffered permanent brain damage (and is on life support) since a surgical procedure gone wrong at the doctor's clinic several years ago. As Morse investigates, a curious bond of sorts develops between the two men - investigator and suspect, as Morse develops a respect for Steppings' devotion to his daughter, and Steppings in turn admires Morse's tenacity and devotion to his job. But there are also other suspects, the victim's son who did not get along with his father, and the victim's own wife, who might have known of her husband's affair with a nurse.

Could this be a revenge plot or is there more to it than that? There are several red herrings in the plot which makes it an incredibly engaging viewing experience as one tries to puzzle out who could be the murderer. I truly enjoyed this episode, and it is on my list of Top Ten Morse episodes.

The Day of the Devil
In The Day of the Devil, the Oxford police are in an uproar when a convicted serial rapist, John Barrie, escapes from prison. Chief Inspector Morse comes under pressure from his commanding officer to ensure Barrie is captured as soon as possible. This however proves to be a Herculean task as Barrie is a master of disguise and in possession of a sharp mind. He also seems to be in possession of a car and a place to live, which leads Morse and Lewis to suspect he has some assistance. The question is, who?

As the investigative team of Morse and Lewis comb the countryside, unearthing clues in pursuit of Barrie, a housewife is abducted and later released, unharmed, by Barrie. This leads Morse to wonder at the change in Barrie's modus operandi, and not only that, Barrie seems obsessed in getting in touch with Dr. Esther Martin, who was Barrie's psychiatrist in prison. Meanwhile, Barrie's interest in the occult also leads to an investigation of the local Satanist cult in Oxford, since a day revered by Satanists is fast approaching. Morse and Lewis scramble to figure out the links in the case before someone gets seriously hurt.

There is suspense and tension throughout the story, and part of what makes this series so addictive is the intricate plot with red herrings that make it difficult to figure out motivations and who the actual perpetrators are. Highly recommended for fans of high-quality British crime dramas.",1351641600,14,4790,4.767189384800965
4833970,5,B005M2AKOW,"This is Set Nine of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.

Set Nine has three episodes. The first was the last episode of the original BBC Series 6 (BBC uses ""series"" instead of ""seasons""). The last two episodes of this set were originally aired as the first two episodes of BBC Series 7, in the same order.
Episodes:
Cherubim & Seraphim - originally aired April 1992
Deadly Slumber - aired January 1993
The Day of the Devil - aired January 1993

CHERUBIM & SERAPHIM:
It's dawn, and teenagers pour out of a cavernous industrial building, leaving what we might call a rave. Some gather around a make-shift fire.  Marilyn, a good looking blonde, is peaceful but pensive. She turns to her friend, Vicky, and says, ""That was the most wonderful... [The next] can't be as good as tonight. It can never be as good as tonight... Tonight was it for me.""

Terribly, we see just what she means, when she commits suicide. Morse takes leave from work when he finds out, because Marilyn was the beloved daughter of his step-sister.

Then two more teens, intelligent, lots-to-look-forward-to teens, commit suicide, and Morse is on the case. Something, he's sure, is connecting the deaths. They get a break. The third suicide has a partially digested pill in his stomach, and it's some kind of mood enhancer they haven't seen before.

We get more insights into Morse when, tired and shattered, he tells Lewis about his childhood, and why he considered suicide at one point. Morse is so uncharacteristically open that he even calls Lewis ""Robby"".

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is when you see him sitting next to Dr. Collier at the Seraphic drug presentation. In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, John Thaw says this about his character: ""I keep using the word 'sad' in relation to him, and that's the way I feel about it. That's the way I played him right through.""

DEADLY SLUMBER:
Dr. Matthew Brewster leaves the Brewster Clinic and heads home for the night. His wife, Claire, who worked with him creating the groundbreaking clinic, is waiting for him at home, and frets when he doesn't show up. We see why. He's in the detached garage, door closed, motor running, dead.

The pathologist says it's murder, and Morse and Lewis start by interviewing the family. John Brewster, son, shows Morse threatening letters his father had received. This leads Morse to Michael Steppings, who's filed a lawsuit against the clinic on behalf of his daughter, invalided during surgery at the Brewster Clinic.

Steppings is such a straight-forward man, clear, open, unwavering in his love for his daughter, that when some evidence points towards him, Morse is reluctant to believe it.

Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is as the porter who shows Morse and Lewis to John Brewster at the college. I must be an indiscriminate fan, because I seldom see bloopers. But even I saw this one. Matthew Brewster's body is lying on the pathologist's table with nothing on but a towel draped over his hips. As the pathologist talks to Morse and Lewis, the body on the table takes a deep breath!

THE DAY OF THE DEVIL:
We start out in a prison hospital. A guard lays draped across his desk, drugged, as his shirt, wallet and keys are taken off him. We see the escaping prisoner sneak around to the outside of the building, where he gets a spectacular break. Dr. Martin, psychologist, is just leaving from the night shift. She is taking a lot of files home, and leaves the keys in her car door as she goes inside to get the 2nd batch.

Thames Valley CID goes on red alert. The escapee is John Peter Barry AKA The Devil's Disciple. Barry stays one step ahead of them by changing his disguise more than once. Morse visits Barry's room at the hospital and is horrified that they allowed him to paint occult signs on his wall, and encouraged him in writing a book, a ""Black Bible"". ""Weren't you meant to be curing him of this?"", and angry Morse asks the hospital General Manager.

He replies, ""By indulging him, he opened up to one of our psychiatrists, Esther Martin. In order to engage Barry, Martin read up on the occult. He came to see her as a fellow believer, and more, as an earthly medium for some demoness, Astrath.""

""And you bought this?"" Morse in his best not-suffer-fools-gladly voice. Alarms certainly went off in my head! In a few days it will be Lammas Day, ""when homage is paid to the devil"". What does Barry have planned?

Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is when he's drinking tea on a hotel lawn.

4833971,5,B005M2AKOW,"There is a darkness lapping at the edges of Inspector Morse's fine and complicated mind, explored here in another set of mysteries. As you draw closer to the edge of the series, don't despair, the journey continues with the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Complete-Inspector-Lewis/dp/B0056031NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector Lewis</a>. You also may want to calm your nerves by imbibing Samuel Smith's remarkable ales along with Morse. Samuel Smith's Yorkshire Stingo, only sporadically available, is a work of art aged in oak and bottle conditioned (enjoy the viscous yeast from the bottom of the bottle too). Smith's Imperial Stout is Morse-worthy, while the Inspector downs many a bottle of Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale, a beverage suited to assuage his sepia-toned moods.

Cherubim & Seraphim: Morse is immersed in family tragedy while visiting his stepmother and half-sister, and we learn a little more about his inner-pain. The young are vulnerable because they don't know that life's hurts can get worn-away with time, thus even Morse's stepniece is at-risk in a mystery that explores rampant drug use and the rave scene. Jason Isaacs is excellent in an early role. A bit of a departure for the series, with Inspector Morse retracing his niece's steps through a rough, lost generation.

Deadly Slumber: A great episode written by Daniel Boyle, one of the better scribes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hamish-MacBeth-Series-1-3-Collection/dp/B000SINSYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hamish MacBeth: Series 1-3 Collection</a>. A fiercely-loving ex-crook father watches over his daughter whilst she lies dormant in a coma. After the doctor running the clinic is murdered, Morse tackles dealing with this devoted parent, and the two develop mutual respect; the relationship between crook and copper is strangely understanding.

The Day of the Devil: A dangerous convict escapes from a high-security prison, due to the foolish compassion of the attending doctors. Inspector Morse follows the convoluted path of this criminal, who not only is a master of disguise, but a devil-worshiper of the worst ilk. With Satanism appearing in Oxfordshire, Morse is under great deal of pressure to protect the convict's psychiatrist, and resolve the case.",1331769600,15,2397,6.064896755162242
