8289660,5,B001CU9ECW,"This 43-minute documentary is an entertaining overview of Barbarian European weaponry used in 1200 BC-500 AD, particularly in the endless wars against the Roman Empire that it eventually conquered. It's fast-moving military history that focuses on swords and axes and chariots in addition to Barbarian culture (Visigoths, Celts, etc.) in a way that is not boring at all, featuring nice CGI animations in addition to commentary by modern sword smiths and historians. However, full disclosure is in order: This episode of History Channel's ""Modern Marvels"" series is also available for free as part of the ""Rome: Rise and Fall of an Empire"" four-disc DVD set, where it is featured as a bonus episode at the end of the last disc. That's where I viewed it myself and I feel I got more bang for my buck that way. Some may prefer to have the video on a disc of its own, but History Channel DVDs like this one feature no extra features at all, and the full ""Rome"" series is packaged very nicely. If you've got a bit of extra money, I recommend buying the full ""Rome"" set including this excellent video, which feels more compelling as a supplement to the full Rome series than as a stand-alone video in its own right.",1394150400,,1209,4.68075117370892
