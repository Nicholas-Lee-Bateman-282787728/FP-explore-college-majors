766580,5,6304056931,"One of the best of Fritz Lang's American movies - a thriller with the logic and plausibility of a nightmare.  Lang's technique is so sure and so seductive that the viewer completely identifies with the safe, serene protagonist (Edward G. Robinson), an associate professor of psychology in a New York City college, and shares his shock and fear when he's caught in a trap.  The professor is interested in the relation of motive to homicide - an interest that's purely a matter of intellectual curiosity.  Then, when his wife and child are out of town, he visits a woman's apartment; her lover comes in and unexpectedly attacts him, and he kills the intruder with a pair of scissors..............  Cleverly, Bennett is the alluring subject of a painting he admires; (the woman in the window, natch). A refreshing, intelligent little thriller-melodrama with a surprise ending.",958694400,5,873,5.041666666666667
766581,5,6304056931,"Fritz Langs great, clever movie about fidelity, of all things, wrapped in a murder melodrama. Robinson plays a meek, well-respected man of standing who after sending his wife and child away for the summer (a common practice  of well-off New Yorkers in the days befor air conditioners)lusts after the  painting of a beautiful woman in the window of an art store.
The  conservative, reliable Robinson imagines what it would be like if he were  presented with the opportunity to be impetuous for once. Oh, what he would  do if he ever met this woman.
Lang obliges, or shall we say lets him have  it, and Robinson's dream turns into a nightmare. A  lesson actually.  Remember what your mother told you about what happens to little boys who  smoke?
Maltin calls this a melodrama. It's actually a very subtle, dark  comedy, one without any jokes. Just a scenario that gets out of hand as it  rolls along. I can't explain why without giving it away, just a terrific  storyline.",928195200,24,970,4.708333333333333

Happily, it isn't. Both features are in glorious black and white as was intended. Despite the fact that it's a DVD- R, it arrived shrink wrapped and has a silkscreened label featuring the cover art from the case.

767007,5,6304056931,"This is a review of the region 1 version of MGM's own release of Fritz Lang's superb 1944 film noir, The Woman in the Window. There are no extras, but the film itself is presented very well in the correct 4:3 aspect ratio with sharp images which do justice to Milton R. Krasner's superb noir photography. Lang admirers (and I would suggest all admirers of great cinema) can buy this with no worries.

The Woman in the Window was the first of Lang's (unintended) trilogy of films (the other two were Scarlet Street (1945) and Secret Beyond the Door (1948)) which focus on 'framed desire'. Lang's concern was always with the male gaze, how it frames the world and the dangerous undercurrents which feed the mechanism. The Woman in the Window is Lang's clearest exposition of this theme with the film's narrative structure consisting of a series of frames within frames. First there is Lang the director who arranges a series of images which he frames for us in the form of a film with opening and closing credits. Then there is the framing device of the film itself which has Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson) about to drop off to sleep in his chair near the beginning of the film, only to wake up at the end after the story proper has finished - the film's central narrative is therefore a framed dream. Within that frame Lang constructs a series of other 'frames', kicking off with the frame of a shop window in which Wanley looks at a framed portrait of a beautiful woman. In the window there appears the reflection of a real woman, Alice Reed (Joan Bennett) who Wanley turns to, shocked by being confronted with the same woman who obviously modeled for the portrait in the window. The film frames a reality, which frames a dream, which frames a shop window, which frames a picture frame, which frames a portrait of a woman, which frames the woman in the reality of Wanley's dream! This intricate Chinese-box like construction is followed closely throughout the film with comparisons constantly drawn between several parallel worlds operating at the same time. At different times Wanley plays different characters all hiding within one another. He is the dull routine-bound 'clockwork man' professor who his family have left alone in New York (note the camera dissolve from Wanley to an antique clock, the face of which appearing momentarily on his back as he enters a building with friends). He is the voyeur, obsessed with looking at beautiful women. He fancies himself a romantic lady's man, totally comfortable being picked up by a beautiful seductress. He is the director Lang himself as shown by his meticulous arrangement of mise-en-scene following the murder of Claude Mazard (Arthur Loft) in which he has Reed's apartment arranged so as not to leave any clues. He is the master criminal (think Mabuse or Haghi) who can't resist trying to take responsibility (credit?) for his crime (he holds up his injured hand infected by poison ivy for DA Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey) to look at - as if to surrender to arrest! - and then later starts to lead Lalor and the police to the location of the dead body). He is also the foolish middle-aged man who has allowed himself to be side-tracked and must now pay the price. If this sounds complicated, it isn't really as Lang's deft mastery of mise-en-scene so amply clarifies. As ever with Lang, the master craftsman, a simple surface belies a multi-facetted reality.

Freudian psychoanalysis treads with heavy steps through many Hollywood films of this period, but a casual glance at even a perfectly decent example of this (Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945), for example) shows how sophisticated Lang's usage is in comparison. The Woman in the Window starts with Assistant Professor of Psychology Richard Wanley giving a lecture about Freud. Then we are introduced to Wanley's repressed sexual desires through the scene where he first sees the portrait in the window and in the conversation with his two friends, DA Lalor and Doctor Barkstone (Edward Breon) in which he confesses a hatred for his present sexually repressed middle aged condition. This hatred is in marked contrast with Lalor who views such repression as a good thing. Wanley is teased - won't he take advantage of his temporary bachelorhood and go to a girly show? To which Wanley reveals his voyeurism. He won't go to a review, but if a girl were to perform in front of him he would certainly watch! Wanley then confesses his rebellious mood, having had more drink than usual and (bidding his friends goodnight) tucks up in his chair at his club with the Song of Solomon, the most erotic book available for men (boys) of his generation to read in the school classroom. Fuelled by this 'rebelliousness' and the eroticism of Solomon combined with the portrait he had been ogling earlier, Wanley then embarks on a dream which can only be described as an assertion of his ego (his sexual desire for the mysterious seductress) being punished by his super-ego (his killing of Mazard and the concomitant guilt). The beauty of the way the dream pans out is how marvelously it showcases all of Lang's main obsessions. Over-riding everything is the idea of destiny. A clockwork man of routine, in his dream he makes one mistake and is doomed. The guilt over his self-defence murder of Mazard kick-starts a persecution complex which automatically brings paranoia and fear of surveillance. From his earliest films (especially Der Mude Tod (1921)) right through to his last (The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960)) Lang constantly reworks these themes which have a lot to do with his own world view which was basically that modernity consists of a series of inter-locking systems which work together. When an inner mechanism is upset disaster is nearly always the result. The paranoia especially evoked in The Woman in the Window would appear to be a natural consequence of this cold Langian perception.

The Nunally Johnson script is a marvel of plot construction with barely a weakness in it. What really stands out though are those central scenes in the dream which showcase Lang's world of persecution, paranoia and fate and which are highlighted by Lang's usual impeccable control of mise-en-scene: Wanley being stopped by a patrol car for not using headlights, the movement of the dead body from the apartment to the car, the reflection of Reed in the rain-splattered window (do we trust her, or is she in the process of framing Wanley herself?), Wanley being stopped on the toll road having to dig for another dime while the dead man's head slips uncovered on the back seat, Wanley depositing the body in the grove, grazing his hand on a fence and poison ivy and then leaving car tire prints in the mud as he drives away. All of this is shot with Lang emphasising Wanley being trapped in tight threatening spaces (usually his car), framed in doorways or windows, delayed by policemen or my Mother Nature herself (the rain, the forest, the poison ivy, the barbed wire fence). His guilt fuels his paranoia to a degree we can almost touch, so tangible is Lang's mastery of mise-en-scene here. I wonder if Hitchcock thought of this when shooting Marion Crane's flight from Phoenix in Psycho (1960)? The sequences are remarkably similar. The tension thickens when Wanley is allowed to follow the case courtesy of Lalor who is personally involved. The scene where Wanley is taken back to the scene where he dumped the body is a masterpiece of tension and suspense, especially when Wanley has to retire to the car for fear of perhaps meeting Reed again. Trapped in the car he is the framed picture of paranoid middle-aged vulnerability. Lang turns the screw even tighter with the use of props which resurface at different times during the film. There's the straw hat worn by all three aggressors who threaten Wanley's security - the murderous Hazard, the sharp DA Lalor and the slimy blackmailer, Heidt (Dan Duryea) which suggests sexual potency which frightens the timid professor (this prefigures the castration anxiety of Chris Cross in Lang's next film, Scarlet Street), and then of course there's the phallic pencil which Reed takes from his vest and which in turn is taken by Heidt for blackmailing purposes. It is indeed Wanley's ill control of his ego (his unbuttoned libido) which leads him to disaster in the end.

The film's ending has been seen as a cop-out by many. I disagree completely. Lang himself insisted that the dream framework be there, even though it wasn't in the original J. H. Wallis book, Once Off Guard. As I have said earlier the frame is an important part of the film's narrative structure. Also the many Freudianisms that pepper the film seem very natural because they are framed as part of a dream, psychoanalysis as we all know being all about the interpretation of dreams. The ending also gives the film a perfect balance with some of the characters in the dream reappearing 'in reality' to account for the pattern of Wanley's reverie. I don't think Lang was avoiding a downbeat end. If he didn't like gloomy endings why did he have Chris Cross so badly punished in his next film? In any case, you could argue that even though The Woman in the Window ends with a joke, the closure is still pretty grim. Wanley wakes up, but he's still trapped in a sexually-repressed clockwork existence he despises. Admittedly, the film does come across as the lighter more humorous reflection of the altogether darker Scarlet Street, but it's bleak nevertheless. The scene where Wanley seemingly dies in his chair is as dark as the final image of Scarlet Street which has Cross limping brokenly down the street. Wanley may wake up, but Lang makes absolutely clear that both remain clockwork men with all sexual feelings rubbed out. In Lang's world Wanley is as dead as Cross even if he is only dimly aware of it - they both end up castrated. Important to the success of both pictures was the use of the same lead actors (Bennett, Duryea and Robinson all outstanding) who gave Lang exactly what he was looking for. Robinson in particular is the one who gives most to the picture, his capturing of meek and mild sexually repressed middle age being supremely sad, pathetic, funny, warm and wise. It's his warmth that does the most to counter-balance Lang's cold vision of human nature. We care about the characters of Richard Wanley and Chris Cross and feel profound sympathy for their plight. It's Robinson we have to thank for this, not Lang. Finally though, we can't deny Lang his acclaim. The two films really do show this superb director at the height of his considerable powers. You would have to be crazy not to want to watch them again and again, so countless are the pleasures.",1411430400,3,10706,4.813688212927756

These are two suspenseful movies from the 1940s that are worth watching more than once. Edward G. Robinson plays an eminent college professor in the first and an undercover Federal agent in the second movie. The reviews for each movie have more details.

""The Woman in the Window"" (1944) is the story about a college professor who meets a strange beautiful woman on the street and become madly in love with her. His love and emotions cause him to violate his moral beliefs. Shouldn't he know better? Will his activities be detected by the policeman who is a friend of his? This is a warning about becoming involved with strangers when you know little about them.

""The Stranger"" (1946) is the story about a hunt for a Nazi war criminal who has take refuge in a small college town. The background tells about college life then. Could a wanted Nazi become part of the faculty of a this college? [No background checks?] Some parts seem implausible, but its still a good story. ""Operation Paperclip"" and ""The Belarus Project"" are history books with topics related to this story.",1409788800,5,1114,4.702564102564103

767126,4,6304056931,"This review is for the MGM/UA VHS version of Woman in the Window.  If you hunt around, you can still find brand-new VHS tapes from Amazon-affiliated merchants and other sources.  I bought the VHS because the DVD, which is also out of print (except in colorized and DVD-r and Korean versions), is currently ridiculously expensive.

My copy, which was advertised as new and sealed, was in fact new (still had a paper advertising insert for James Bond VHS tapes from years ago!) and it plays fine.  There are no flaws or glitches on the mechanical side, and the image is clean and clear.  If there are any sparkles, tiny breaks in the continuity, etc., I didn't notice them or they didn't affect my enjoyment.  The sound was no problem.

WARNING regarding Run Time:  The tape is advertised on the back cover of the cardboard sleeve as 1 hour, 39 minutes, i.e., 99 minutes.  It is important to know this, because currently the Amazon ad (I have since submitted a correction, but don't know how long it takes to process) says that the VHS is 107 minutes.  I in fact ordered the tape because 107 minutes is the run time listed on the IMDb, and I wanted the longest available edition.  I was therefore surprised when the tape arrived, and the jacket clearly indicated only 99 minutes.  I have since tried to find a 107-minute version, but to no avail.  Today I was able to view the back cover of the DVD version on Amazon and it also indicates only 99 minutes, which means that again the Amazon site information is wrong, since the DVD edition is listed at 107 minutes.  I've submitted a correction for that, too.

I have been unable to find out if a longer version ever existed.  There is no obvious gap in the plot in the version I have; however, the opening lecture given by Robinson's university professor character is suspiciously short, lasting only a few seconds.  I suspect that in the original film it lasted a few minutes, and touched on some of the psychological themes (the prof is a psychology prof) relevant to the murder that later takes place in the film.  It seems to me that a commentator on the Scarlet Street DVD or elsewhere refers to Freudian themes in Robinson's lecture, but I can't find those comments now.  Anyhow, if anyone out there has any information on the ""missing"" 8 minutes of this film, please append a reply to my review below.

The movie itself is good.  It has an interesting plot, engaging characters, and solid acting.  It is well worth watching.  The ending is one that some will find unsatisfactory -- some would call it ""gimmicky"" or a cop-out or one that disqualifies the film as a true noir.  More than that I cannot say, without spoiling it.  Nonetheless, the ending is merely a twist which alters the viewer's final mood; it does not spoil the plot or story line itself, so if even if you don't like the ending you can still enjoy the entire film except for the ending.

Many have said that this film is inferior to Scarlet Street, Lang's other film of the period with the same actors.  Possibly this is true, though if you take away the dubious ending, I think the films are close to equal in quality.  Scarlet Street's plot is more complex, no doubt about that, and probably the characterization is more complex as well.  That is probably why Woman in the Window is not quite as good *as a film noir* as Scarlet Street.  But if one forgets about the noir classification, Woman in the Window stands on its own as a very good Lang, Robinson, Bennett, etc. psychological crime story.  It's not a Top Ten Noir, not even a Top Ten murder story, but it is a very good story.  Recommended.",1394409600,3,3624,4.527692307692308

767130,3,6304056931,"This is a good deal, considering the very low price for 2 films on one DVD, but the downside is that ""Woman in the Window"" is a colorized print!  I've seen this film many times and have an excellent black and white copy on DVD, so it was of some mild interest to me to see what sort of colorization had been done to it.  It's actually not bad, but as others have pointed out, it destroys the entire dark, film noir ambiance of this excellent film!  So, don't buy the disc for that movie, but rather for the excellent black and white print of ""The Stranger.""

""The Stranger"" is a better movie than ""Woman in the Window,"" directed by and starring Orson Welles at the peak of his career, and the print on this DVD appears to be as good as the one on the excellent 2007 MGM DVD release.  If you already have that disc, you can skip this one entirely (unless you really want to see a colorized job done on ""Woman in the Window"").

767336,3,6304056931,"Okay, okay I know this one is a crime noir by Fritz Lang and I will bow down, bow down profusely, over his use of interesting cinematic techniques, his photography, and his attention to detail that were his hallmark traits.  That done though what is there to yell about in this noir? Sure there is a femme fatale, sort of, played here by Joan Bennett who whatever her ruby red-lipped, bedazzled charms for 1940s male audiences, or female audiences for that matter, does not compare, compare at all, to such femmes as Lauren Bacall, Rita Hayworth, or Jane Greer.

And sure there is a murder, sort of, committed by a learned New York professor of psychology, no less, played by, well played by, Edward G. Robinson, better known for his great 1930s gangsta movies. And there is a blackmailer, sort of, to complicate the plot, played by Dan Duryea.  And there is a circling around the wagons to find the murderer by law enforcement, headed by clever, sneaky clever Raymond Massey. That is natural for this genre. But didn't I already, sort of, review this film before under the name Scarlet Street with this same cast of characters. Fritz Lang directed that one as well and provided us with his hallmark traits. And the crimes were real there, if not rightly solved.

 Maybe I had better give a little plot to show what I mean. The good professor, the good middle-aged professor, (Edward G. Robinson) is having something like a mid-life crisis as his wife and kids leave town, New York town, to get away from the bustle of the city. On the way to his Mayfair swell club (on a 1940s professor's salary?) he is entranced by a portrait of a beautiful woman  in an art gallery window (hence the title of the film). Well one thing leads to another and while he is a little drunk after dinner he has what turns out to be an adventure, a theoretical adventure, which will have him facing the gallows before dawn. Seems our lady of the window (Ms. Bennett) appears in ""real"" life, is in distress due to some caddish lover, and is in need of our professor's services as her gallant knight. In short, he kills, kills in self-defense really, the cad.

Of course, under the circumstances, they have try to commit the perfect crime by covering up, covering up as it turns out in such a poor way that any school boy could sent them to the electric chair on day one of the investigation and have time for lunch. To add to their cover-up distress woes, a blackmailer (Brother Duryea), a worldly-wise (at least in comparison to their amateurish antics) wants dough for his silence. Ya, I know, the suspension of disbelief part associated with any movie just doesn't quite make it.  And it doesn't have to because at the end the good professor merely had just too much to drink. So back to the drawing board on this one, except now we get our noses rubbed into the theme song of this genre. Crime doesn't pay, awake or asleep. Sorry Fritz but you will always have Metropolis as your immortal work.",1323993600,,2975,4.547663551401869

767338,5,6304056931,"One admirable point about Fritz Lang's The Woman in the Window is its well-timed pacing, with building suspense and tension as Professor Wanley's alibi and cover up begins to disintegrate. This, however, would be selling the film short because it has so much more. Effective atmosphere, solid performances by Edward G.Robinson as the conservative professor and Joan Bennett as the mysterious ""woman in the window"" make this one of those films you can view again and appreciate.

In the film, the problems start when Professor Wanley (Robinson) after having a few drinks with his buddies, encounters the beautiful Alice Reed (Bennett). A married man, Wanley is not used to taking chances, so when the mysterious woman invites him up, he has some reluctance, but eventually agrees to go. Little does he realize that Ms. Reed has some baggage in her life, and before long a dangerously jealous boyfriend shows up. When something goes horribly wrong, and there is an accidental death, the two have to think quickly to save themselves or explain. Wanley must think of a plan, but nothing is full proof, and he begins to wonder how much he can trust this woman and exactly how much he really knows about her. Problems are compounded when a blackmailer who knows the details enters the scene, and starts making demands.

The Woman in the Window is a fine bit of suspense, especially as Wanley clumsily tries to hide what happened from District Attorney friend (Raymond Massey). There are plenty of moments of cat and mouse in dialogue, and often we are unsure whether it is just friends jesting, or a real trap by the D.A.
The ending is what most viewers complain about, and I was a little disappointed with the unraveling of events and ultimate conclusion on my first viewing. However, I think part of the disappointment was the fact that I've seen ""that"" kind of ending often in films; in today' cinema it seems like a clich. However, an ending like this probably hadn't been tried often in Lang's time, so I guess I can give it a pass. Nonetheless, it doesn't take away from an excellent viewing experience.",1304812800,,2103,4.806629834254144
767339,3,6304056931,"Woman in the Window is one of 5 films that helped launch the ""film noir"" genre. Following WW 2, American films finally reached France, where the audiences had a chance to watch several films together. For the French this identified some patterns, and when they saw ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), ""Laura"" (1944), ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944) and this film, they coined the term ""film noir"" to refer to films that highlighted the seamy side of life and carried a cynical message.

Film noir had its roots in German expressionism and films like ""The Blue Angel"" (1929) and ""M"" (1931) as well as American gangster films like ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1931) and ""Scarface"" (1932).

The film stars Edward G Robinson (1893-1973) who gained fame as ""Little Caesar"" (1931) but who argued strongly to be permitted to play non-gangster roles, which he did in several subsequent films such as ""Five Star Final"" (1931), ""Tiger Shark"" (1932), and ""Kid Galahad"" (1937). By 1944 he was almost completely out of the gangster genre. Robinson does a good job in this film as a Psychology Professor enamored with a woman whose portrait he seems in a winbdow, but it's hardly among his best performances.

Joan Bennett (1910-90) plays the woman. She made more than 70 films and was nominated for an Emmy for her work on the TV series ""Dark Shadows"" (1966-71). She's best remembered for her role in this film and ""Scarlett Street"" and for the 1951 sex/shooting scandal involving her husband film producer Walter Wanger. She was the sister of actress Constance Bennett. As a blond, she played Harlow type roles in ""She Wanted a Millionaire"" (1932) and ""Me and My Gal"" (1932), but as a brunette, she made more serious films, like ""Trade Winds"" (1938), ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" (1939) and ""The Son of Monet Cristo"" (1940). I liked her best in ""Man Hunt"" (1941), the first of her films with Lang.

Dan Duryea (1907-68) was a marvelous character actor with a quick smile that barely hid a more sinister demeanor used to great effect in films like ""Criss Cross"" (1949), ""Winchester 73"" (1950) and ""Night Passage"" (1957). Director Fritz Lang used him in several films, including ""Ministry of Fear"" (1944) and ""Scarlett Street"" (1944). Lang specifically used Duryea in order to put some youthful blood in a film that was otherwise populated with middle aged men. Duryea does a great job as the menacing crooked ex-cop who blackmails Bennett.

The great Raymond Massey (1896-1983) was nominated for an Oscar for playing ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940) which remains, to date, the best ever portrayal of Lincoln. On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series ""Dr Kildare"" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films. I remember him best for his over the top portrayal of John Brown in ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940). Prior to playing Lincoln, most of his roles were villainous (e.g., Philip of Spain in ""Fire Over England"", Black Michael in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"", Prince Ghul in ""The Drum""). By 1944 he was playing heroes, and in this film he plays a District Attorney and friend of Robinson.

Look for Spanky McFarland (1928-1933) as the Boy Scout who finds the body and Robert Blake (1933) as Dickie Wanley, one of Robinson's children.

Director Fritz Lang (1890-1976) was one of the fathers of film noir. More than anyone else he is responsible for popularizing the German school of expressionist film, with the ""Dr. Mabuse"" series (1922, 1933, 1960), ""Metropolis"" (1927), and ""M"" (1931). In 1934 he came to the US where he made such notable films as ""Fury"" (1936), ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), ""Western Union"" (1940), and ""Hangman Also Die"" (1943). He followed  this film with ""Scarlet Street"" (1945), ""Clash by Night"" (1952), and ""Rancho Notorious"" (1954). While he was never nominated for an Oscar, his work influenced the work of many directors, including Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.

The screenplay is from Nunnally Johnson (1897-1977)  who also served as producer. Johnson was famous for his dark stories (e.g., ""Cardinal Richelieu"", ""The Prisoner of Shark Island"", ""Jesse James"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""The Dark Mirror"") and his films often had a large psychological aspect to them (e.g., ""Three Faces of Eve"", ""Night People"").  He was nominated twice for an Oscar for writing - ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940 and ""Holy Matrimony"" (1943) and won a Cannes award for ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" (1956).

Milt Krasner (1904-88) provided the camerawork. He was nominated for an Oscar 6 times and won once - ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" (1954). He made more than 100 films. His other notable works include ""All About Eve"" (1950), ""Scarlett Street"" (1945), ""The Dark Mirror"" (1946)"", ""House of Strangers"" and my favorite Krasner film - Fate is the Hunter"" (1965). The camerawork in this film is exceptional; up to some of Krasner's finest work.

The film received a nomination for Best Music but lost to ""Spellbound"". Variety called it ""a strong and decidedly suspenseful murder melodrama"" and praised the ""fine timing in the direction by Fritz Lang and outstanding performances...""

1944 was not a strong year for films. ""Going my Way"" was the big multiple Oscar winner.  ""Gaslight"" did well at the box office and won Ingrid Bergman an Oscar. Other notable films were Judy Garland's ""Meet me in St Louis"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""Arsenic and Old Lace"". War films were popular - ""Lifeboat"", ""Since You Went Away"", ""To Have and Have Not"", ""Hollywood Canteen"", ""The Fighting Seabees"", ""Ministry of Fear"", ""Passage to Marseille"", and ""The Fighting Sullivans"".

Film noir flourished in the 40s, especially the mid 40s. 1944 film noir included ""Double Indemnity"", ""Laura"", ""Ministry of Fear"", ""Murder My Sweet"", ""To Have and Have Not"", ""Dark Waters"", and ""Phantom Lady"".

Unfortunately, despite all the comments, ""Woman in the Window"" is not film noir. Although there are plenty of shots in the rain, and dark corners, there are few of the classic requirements for good film noir. Bennett is a temptress, but she doesn't double cross anyone. There is no ensemble of seedy characters - quite the opposite - the ensemble (Massey, Thomas Jackson, Edmund Breon) are all pillars of society. While the camera work is exceptional, it clearly owes more to Hitchcock than to Lang's classic film noirs in which the angles are sharply divergent and the shadows take on a life of their own. And in the end, tragedy does not engulf all the participants, regardless of which ending you use.

People interested in film noir need to look elsewhere. That doesn't mean this isn't a good film, with good performances, great camerawork, and taut suspenseful direction.",1303948800,6,6651,4.944444444444445

767341,5,6304056931,"Brilliantly portrayed by Edward Robison as a psychology professor Richard Wanley and Joan Bennett as fashion model Alice Reed, the story carries the viewers thorough the drama of intrigue and murder mystery. The screenplay was written by one of the most successful writers of Hollywood, Nunnally Johnson who also wrote for such classics as: The Three Faces of Eve. The Grapes of Wrath, We're not Married, How to Marry a Millionaire, and Dirty Dozen.

The story starts when Richard Wanley, after bidding goodbye to his wife and two children (Robert Blake stars as Dickey Wanley) for a two week vacation, becomes captivated by the portrait of a beautiful woman in the display window of a storefront. His friends, District Attorney Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey) and family physician Dr. Michael Barkstane (Edmond Breon) see him looking at the painting and kid him about his interest in the woman. Later that evening he meets the model who admits that she frequently comes to the spot to check out people's reactions to the painting. A friendly conversation leads the two to drink at the club next door followed by a visit to her apartment, where she shows Richard Wanley other sketches by her artist friend. During this private moment, enters the jealous lover of Alice, Claude Mazard (Arthur Loft) and attacks Wanley thinking he is her lover, when the struggle becomes too much for Wanley, Alice helps him with a scissor to attack him and this result in her lover's death. Both are baffled by the sudden change of events and they make a quick decision to dispose the body in a remote area of the town. By this time it is late in the night. The next day the two learn that the dead man, Claude Mazard is a famous in the field of finance and obviously the case becomes very prominent in the media, and also figure in the friendly conversation with his friends District Attorney Lalor and physician Barkstane. Soon Wanley learns the crime solving minds of Lalor and Police Inspector (Thomas E. Jackson) and realize that they are closing on him. Since the guilty mind doesn't rest, Wanley frequently gives clues to DA that he knows too much about the crime scene. Complicating matters for the worse, a con man and an extortionist named Tim, a.k.a Heidt (Dan Duryea) starts scaring Alice Reed that he will go to the police against her and her new lover who may have been involved in the murder. The movie has a strange ending where the extortionist is shot dead by the police in a shootout and they find some personal belongings of the murder victim which he retrieved from Alice Reed's apartment. DA is too smart to believe that Dan Duryea is the real killer but under circumstances he has to accept that theory since Richard Wanley, too scared by the worsening of events by the minute, commits suicide. The ending is somewhat strange and intriguing which the readers must learn by watching the movie.

The dialog between Wanley and Lalor is very interesting as Wanley self incriminates himself several times that demonstrates the quick mind of the DA played Raymond Massey. At one instance he says: ""It's all right Richard, don't get excited. We rarely arrest people just for knowing where the body was"". As always, Edward Robinson demonstrates that he is one of the finest actors of Hollywood and Joan Bennett plays as somewhat seductive young woman. She may be remembered for her another memorable performance in Louisa May Alcott's classic ""Little Women,"" starring Kathryn Hepburn and Joan Bennett. ""The woman in the window"" is a great drama with plenty of mystery.

767483,5,6304056931,"** Some SPOILERS contained in this review which I feel are unavoidable **

It's interesting in retrospect that Fritz Lang, the director more than any other associated with the shadowy and deterministic world of film noir started off his noir period  with this (relatively) sunny, funny, and even playful film that seems to poke fun at the whole criminal-detective genre all the while offering a riveting example of it.  I suspect that most viewers won't guess the ""twist"" ending on their first viewings, but careful rewatches show it to be fairly logical and not the throw-you-for-a-loop that some less-kind viewers have seen it as.

Professor of Psychology Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson) is seen giving a lecture on the psychology of murder, after which he sees his wife and kids off for their weekend in the country, and then goes to meet a couple of old friends at his club, just outside of which he admires a mysterious portrait painting of a beautiful young woman.  One of his friends is a District Attorney (Raymond Massey) and the talk amongst the group inevitably turns to such subjects as crime, their growing infirmities as they move through middle age, the dangers of too much alcohol, the desires of infirm flesh and minds.  Wanley retires to a favorite chair to read, desiring to be reminded when it is 10:30.

At the appointed hour, the Professor leaves the club, pausing once more to admire the mysterious portrait - but this time encountering the model who posed for it, the equally beautiful Alice Reed (Joan Bennett).  Having had a little too much, the Professor unwisely accompanies Miss Reed to her apartment to look at more paintings - but they are unfortunately surprised by her lover, ""Frank"", a fight ensues, and Frank is dead with scissors in the back.  The calm and rational Professor must now think through the best way for the two of them to beat the rap, disguise the crime, dispose of the body....but of course his friend the District Attorney is involved, as is blackmailer Heidt (Dan Duryea).  Soon it appears there may be more blood on Wanley's hands, and can he really trust Miss Reed, who he has only known for hours?  It all seems rather absurd...and perhaps it is.

The suspense keeps building - at every moment the Professor stays calm, though Miss Reed gets more and more upset, but at every moment the noose seems to get closer - and Wanley himself helps to tighten it as he keeps making strange, knowing comments in front of DA and police.  Yet he appears too calm, and everything seems just a little too by the book, so it might strike us as a little too obvious when he finally chooses to take just a bit too much of his powerful heart medicine, and we see him slumped over in his chair, apparently....dreaming.  He gets up, exits the club, can't help but notice the painting, but this time when a beautiful model walks up to him, he knows better than to stop and get involved in what might be just a moment's conversation...or an adventure ending in the gallows!

What's terrific here most of all is the playing around with conventions both of the kinds of characters we associate with these films - Massey's DA in particular seems like he's in on the whole `joke' at various points, and the subject that Robinson teaches, psychology,  plays into both his own psychology as he coolly tries to find a way out of the mess - and that of the filmmakers and viewers, as we cast our critical gazes on the story and ultimately might decide that it's all a little too pat.  Of course it is, and the film acknowledges this more than once as Robinson seems almost eager to give himself away - but it always just gets to the brink of self-parody, never quite crossing it; if this is among the most self-conscious of films noir, it's also one of the most fun to re-watch and re-analyze, even after one knows the gimmick.

Superbly photographed, very much a ""Hollywood-New York"" film, done all on sets, but in this case the artificial reality of it all affords the dream-logic of the film a perfect setting.  It's nice to see Robinson play someone largely competent, a nice guy caught up by circumstance; Bennett, too, is more a ""normal"" character than usual.  Duryea's usual greasiness and Massey's sardonic humor round things out nicely; certainly up to the director's usual standards.  Followed the next year by Lang's  SCARLET STREET with the same three principal cast members (Bennett, Robinson, Duryea) and director of photography (Milton Krasner).

The solid KINO DVD release looks great, but offers nothing in the way of extras.",1260316800,5,4572,4.723270440251572
767484,5,6304056931,"The war years saw Hollywood's leading men unavailable - Clark Gable, James Stewart, and many others, were otherwise occupied. At this point, some of the better character actors stepped up to starring roles they might not otherwise have gotten. The darkness of the war years also did a bit to loosen the grip of the production code by allowing darker plots than would otherwise pass inspection, but the evildoers still had to be punished in the end. This began the trend of ""film noir"" - related to their predecessors, the precodes, by examining the seedy side of life, but emphasizing the duality of man's nature rather than the sexual angles and the evolving roles of women and men in society as the films of the early 30's tended to do.

""The Woman in the Window"" is a great film noir starring the great Edward G. Robinson as a mild mannered New York City professor. He packs his wife and kids off to the country at the beginning of the summer as was the custom back before the days of air conditioning, and he begins his three month bachelorhood by joining two friends at his private club, one of which is D.A. Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey). Before entering his club, though, he appreciates a painting of a beautiful woman, ""the woman in the window"". His two friends see him staring, kid him about it, and they proceed to have a conversation in which the D.A. talks about how many cases he sees in which a small wrong step by an ordinarily law-abiding citizen leads to major crime.

The rest of the film is basically a demonstration of what the D.A. spoke about when you mix Robinson's mild professor with the actual flirtatious woman in the window (Joan Bennett), add a case of homicide in self-defense under seemingly scandalous circumstances where there is no way to prove self-defense, and finally introduce a seedy blackmailing P.I. (Dan Duryea) into the mix. The film has many twists and turns and you can feel your guts wrenching along with Robinson's as he watches the police come closer and closer to his door with every update he gets from his friend the D.A. who thinks he is just sharing an interesting case with a professor of criminology.

The end then takes a sharp turn and totally surprises you.

This film was so good that Fritz Lang followed it up the following year with an even better effort - Scarlet Street - with Robinson, Duryea, and Bennett playing similar parts as they did in this film. There's even a painting as a central plot point in this second film as well.

The video and audio are terrific quality in this film. My only complaint is the same one I have with most MGM classic releases - absolutely no extras whatsoever. All you have are scene selections and alternate language selections. Highly recommended anyways, but be sure you follow it up by watching ""Scarlet Street"".",1254441600,,2812,4.649899396378269
767485,5,6304056931,"This began as a rental for me. The film was an extraordinary surprise for me. The story itself took me to an unexpected place, but the some aspects within the story line I found amazing and educational for me. The forensics explained by the police, for instance. I did not think that science was  that advanced for that time period. It was just as fascinating to listen to as any CSI episode. Don't watch it with the eyes of the 21st century. Allow yourself to go back and walk with Robinson through his situation. I remember Bennett only from ""Dark Shadows"" so her performance was a treat.",1238803200,,590,4.514018691588785
767486,4,6304056931,"If you are looking for movies that offer a vibrant, entertaining, yet cynical take on fate and its relationship to the individual, you need look no further than the filmography of Fritz Lang.

He was probably at his artistic best directing METROPOLIS (1926) and M (1931).  His Hollywood output, in comparison, is much more polished, yet much less immediate.  THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW (1944) is a good example of this.  The images are crisp and well-crafted, the screenwriting is good, and the editing is flawless.  The notorious last scene merely makes these elements more explicit through the juxtaposition of a less powerful ending.  Still, it is ironic that the viewers may find themselves caught in Lang's cynical trap; just as the characters he filmed are seemingly released.

Edward G. Robinson plays Richard Wanley, a fellow who kills a man in self-defense.  Problem is, he was having drinks with Joan Bennett (the woman in the title) in her apartment, while his wife and kids were off on vacation.  It just wouldn't look good.  So begins the crime of removing the body....

Much has already been made of the finale.  I would add that I also found Robinson's role (as an assistant professor) equally jarring.  He looks rather awkward, to me, in a lecture hall.

I join the many other reviewers in preferring Lang's SCARLET STREET (1945); a reuniting of the principle cast.  It is perhaps Lang's best American film.  Robinson's role as a milquetoast is so much more believeable, and Dan Duryea is given more room to be villainous. A true work of art that resonates over the years.

But, by all means, see THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, as well.  Despite its flaws, it is still miles ahead of many other noir vehicles.

I have no complaints about the MGM DVD sound or picture quality; both were great.  I would have liked to have seen some special features though.",1235088000,2,1862,4.759375
767487,5,6304056931,This movie was excellent. The ending is a real surprise especially in view of the movie summary written on the outside of the box that contained the film. I will definitely watch the movie again.,1233532800,,195,4.6
767488,4,6304056931,"The great Expressionist German director Fritz Lang was a natural to direct film noir, and this 1944 thriller is one of his most famous. It features an unusually intelligent cast, headed by Edward G. Robinson, playing a part much closer to his own personality than the sinister gangsters and heavies he usually played. Here he's a gentle middle-aged college psychology professor, who makes one divergence from his safe daily bourgeois routine by accepted the invitation for drinks of a beautiful woman (Joan Bennett) whose painting he admires in a window; before he knows it he's in her swank Manhattan apartment wondering what to do with the body of her violent millionaire lover, whom he has stabbed while defending his life.

Part of the genius of Lang's direction in this film is how he avoids the obvious: the ratcheting up of the tension in this film, as circumstances and a sleazy blackmailer (Duryea), conspire to tighten Robinson's trap, is done very quietly. One of Robinson's best friends is the assistant district attorney(Massey)  who prosecutes the case after the millionaire's body is found, and who shares every new bit of evidence with him; Robinson's character often has to explain jokingly to Massey why the suspect's description often sounds so much like him, and Robinson never once seriously slips up. But you can tell the toll all this takes upon his character over time through Robinson's tremendously subtle performance. The film's ending was changed when the Production Code found it too dark, and you'll feel a bit cheated; as revenge, Lang used a much darker ending even than this film's original when he filmed a re-make of Renoir's LA CHIENNE as SCARLET STREET two years later with the same three terrific principal actors (Robinson, Bennett and Duryea), with much wilder and more Expressionistic results. Although SCARLET STREET is a brilliant film in its own way (and features a painting of Joan Bennett in a prominent bit just as this film does), the quieter approach to this film is equally fascinating. The beautiful cinematography by Milton Krasner is gorgeously represented by this MGM Film Noir print: the whole thing looks as if it were filmed yesterday.",1233273600,,2192,5.052486187845304

767586,4,6304056931,"""The Woman in the Window"" is an enjoyable, suspenseful murder drama, as they were called at the time, that is also notable for launching Dan Duryea's string of ""sadistic dandy"" roles, upon which he built a lucrative career in the 1940s.

After joking about the perils of adventure in middle age, Wanley is pleasantly surprised to run into the model from the portrait, Alice Reed (Joan Bennett). When he accepts an invitation to Alice's apartment to look at some artwork, the harmless flirtation turns deadly: Wanley is forced to kill a jealous boyfriend in self-defense, and his friend Police Inspector Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey) is investigating the crime.

Dan Duryea's role as the dead man's blackmailing bodyguard doesn't display his talent as well as several later roles in the same vein would, but it started an unforgettable trend.

767684,5,6304056931,"Edward G. Robinson gave a superb performance in ""The Woman in the Window"" which he made the same year as he starred in Billy Wilder's classic movie ""Double Indemnity"" (1944). To have two great parts such as these in the same year was a remarkable achievement but Robinson was a talented actor and played a variety of roles in a long and successful career. He started out at Warner Bros. in typical gangster roles (along with Bogart and Cagney) but by the 40's had branched out into other more satisfying characterisations. In ""The Woman in the Window"" he was outstanding as Professor Richard Wanley and had excellent support from Joan Bennett as the seductive Alice Reed and Dan Duryea was suitably menacing as the villainous Heidt. The film was powerfully directed by Fritz Lang with an unexpected surprise twist at the end!!

Robinson plays decent and respectable Richard Wanley whose family life is very straightforward and orderly. However, his peaceful routine is about to be devastated by sinister events completely beyond his control. With his wife and children away on holiday he is visiting his club for a quiet drink with colleagues when he stops to admire the painting of a woman in the window of an art gallery nearby. Much to his astonishment he sees the glamorous model (Joan Bennett) watching him carefully. She explains that she often visits the gallery to check on people's reactions to her painting in the window. After a few minutes conversation they go for a drink and then continue on to her apartment which turns out to be Robinson's biggest mistake. The events which follow lead to violence, murder and blackmail made even more complicated when Wanley's friend District Attorney Lalor (Raymond Massey) is assigned to the investigation.

Some favourite lines from the film:

Joan Bennett (to Edward G. Robinson): ""I'm not married. I have no designs on you and one drink is all I care for"".

Robinson (to Bennett): ""I should never have stopped to talk with you - I should never have come here to drink with you"". Bennett (to Robinson): ""Never?"".

Raymond Massey (to Robinson): ""It's all right Richard - don't get excited. We rarely arrest people just for knowing where the body was"".

""The Woman in the Window"" has a gripping storyline with many surprises along the way and edge of the seat suspense. The viewer is completely riveted by Wanley's predicament as he is drawn deeper and deeper into a situation he can't understand or explain and is unable to get out of. Just when it seems that Wanley's troubles can't get any worse there is a totally unexpected twist at the end of the film which was certainly a surprise to me!  The success of this film encouraged director Fritz Lang to reunite with his three leading players the following year for another classic thriller ""Scarlet Street"". See them both.",984528000,78,2827,4.840579710144928

Memorably casted with Robinson, Joan Bennett as the high-class companion to the rich man that  Robinson murders in the heat of passion, and Dan Duryea as the semi-sleazy  private detective who tries to blackmail the pair.

valiant and shady characters, true natures being revealed, dark streets at night, ominous cinematography, hovering at the edge of discovery, the femme-fatale, a torrid mystery, etc., etc., etc. ...

7859948,4,6304056931,"As far as the movie itself, ""The Woman In The Window"" is a very clever 1944 movie with a strong cast and was originally shot in black and white.  It is one of the movies that caused the term ""film noir"" to come into being.  On this particular DVD my version is colorized.  The movie is, of course, still very clever.  But I enjoy the study of film noir as its own art form.  In that context, if one wishes to study this fine movie as film noir, be aware that some of these DVDs are colorized.

As far as the movie itself, Edward G. Robinson, Raymond Massie, Dan Duryea, and Joan Bennett are all wonderful actors and great in this film.  I will not risk spoiling the viewing experience for someone who has not seen it, but I need to confess I was completely surprised during the movie.  As a student of film noir, I need to see it in black and white, as it was intended.  Thank You...",1492992000,2,883,4.147058823529412
