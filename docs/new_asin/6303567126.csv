682170,5,6303567126,"Maybe because I am older, with kids, I felt very touched by his performance in this film. He accomplished all he set out to in my mind. I also believe his depicting characters from reality is excellant, as is all his debuts. He was the poet, Rimbaud, he was a child -man with an affliction in What's eating Gilbert Grape? And, as in all his glory,he is a true romantic , as he was Romeo. His parents & friends must be so very proud , as are we, his devoted fans. I wait with true excitement, anticipating his next film,don't you?  END",895363200,,534,4.235294117647059
682171,5,6303567126,"If Leonardo diCaprio had not already made this film, he would be cast immediately for the role of lifetime. Mr. diCaprio's performance as the lanky, audacious, and attitude-heavy high school basketball player whose descent into heroin-hell is the true story of the author, Jim Carroll, can only be described as superb. As often as diCaprio is cited for his Titanic performance, ""Basketball Diaries"" is one for his resume of fine, solid performances. With cameras in streets of lower Manhattan, the junkie life of a street urchin is neither fun nor games, it is pathos and crime. Teens who flock to diCaprio films should see ""Basketball Diaries"" as a point of information. When the glamorous veneer of heroin and cocaine wears off, all that is left is the sight of diCaprio -- frothing at the mouth, twisting, and screaming in pain as the cold turkey rehabilitation program of friend, Ernie Hudson takes over his body. Most young girls, the rabid diCaprio fans, would find this scene too realistic and too ugly. But that is what the author intended. In a too brief cameo appearance, Carroll's words are at times glorious poems of haiku grace, but his own speed rap about his memories of a Catholic ceremony is a monologue chilling in its irony, for he is cooking up to fix while he speaks. Fine performances from the young supporting cast including a thuggish Marky Mark Walberg and a heart wrenching Lorraine Bracco as the mother who can do nothing for her son but call the police make ""Basketball Diaries"" worthy of everyone's attention. END",891043200,2,1542,4.866920152091255

682537,5,6303567126,"I absolutely love this movie!  Based on a true story, it is about a talented basketball teen (Jim Carroll) who begins experimenting with heroin for 'fun' with his friends and over time, he soon looses everything that is important to him.  The story leads you down the dark path of his struggles with addiction and his life on the street where he will do just about anything for his next high- all the while, he is writing a journal of his experiences and encounters along the way.  There are a few somewhat graphic scenes, but I think this movie is a most see for any young adult to understand the true pitfalls of drug use and how just a few times of 'experimenting'  can completely change your life.  This movie may not be for everyone- keep that in mind because it is not a 'cute' movie about the lives of teenage boys- it is a serious story line showing how deep Jim's addiction took him during his teenage years. I personally enjoy the stories based on true characters, because those are the ones that seem to captivate me more.  The original book was written back in the 70's but I have not read it yet- cannot wait to read it now.",1462924800,6,1137,4.3649289099526065

682614,5,6303567126,"After his breakout performances in This Boy's Life and his Oscar nominated performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Leonardo DiCaprio's next film choice would be his first leading role and he did not disappoint. Not content to stand on his teen idol looks and play it safe, DiCaprio showed the risk he would take and continue to take throughout his career to show off his acting chops. DiCaprio plays Jim Carroll, a high school basketball start who gets mixed up in the streets of New York and gets strung out on heroin. The film itself is a great, very dark look at the  way experimental drug use can turn very bad very quick. But the highlight of the film is DiCaprio's amazing, realistic, and mesmerizing performance. He reminds me of a young Marlon Brando, James Dean, or Paul Newman in this role and loses himself in the character of Jim. He shows the brilliance at 18 years old that we would go onto see in all his adult movies, especially The Aviator (which he should have won the Oscar for).",1455926400,,1002,4.566666666666666

 We initially find our anti-hero ( played with bravura by a rail-thin Leonardo DiCaprio, who, like his co-star Mark Wahlberg, who plays his friend, Mickey, knew life on the streets of Los Angeles and Boston respectively quite well enough during their formative years) shouting down a crazy neighbor(Marilyn Sokol) in his New York neighborhood, and receiving a paddling from Father McNulty(Ray Cooper) at the Catholic School he attends--St. Vitus.
 He responds to his humiliation with snideness, and we see the street tough, whose drug addiction began when he was twelve, form up with his best friends, including Pedro (James Madio), and Neutron (Patrick McGaw) in addition to Mickey, commit petty crimes, and behave like punks.
 Freed from their parochial school influence, the influence of the street takes over. But even on campus, they deal with a perverted basketball coach named Swifty(Bruno Kirby), who has unwholesome designs on  his charges. But we see Jim emerging as a writer.
 Life on the basketball court is promising for Jim, who, in his own words, ""plays like a cheetah.""
 He and his pals express generosity towards a hospitalized, cancer-stricken teammate named Bobby(Michael Imperioli) for whom they sign a basketball.
 He occasionally challenges his off-campus mentor, Reggie( Ernie Hudson) to after-school games, and we view his home life with his mother(Lorraine Bracco, who is erroneously portrayed as a single parent, whereas , in reality, Jim lived with both parents, and a brother who encouraged his talent for writing) who tries to  give him more responsibility to keep him out of trouble during the summer months.
 Watching this film evoked memories of a High School bus stop acquaintance whose addiction I hadn't really been aware of. He was abusive towards me, from a single parent home, and may have been withdrawing from a high during times in my company. Luckily, my affiliation with him was relatively brief, although sometime after I  transferred to another school, I learned of his suicide.
  We see Jim's descent as he and some of his friends lose their aptitude as players, deal with the loss of Bobby, engage in drugs and sex with girls(Cynthia and Brittany Daniel), get kicked off the basketball team and expelled from school ( neither of which happened in actuality) after a stoned Jim rejects Swifty's advances, and they begin a joint life of more violent crime to support their habit.
 A dream sequence in which Jim enters the classroom where he received corporal punishment dressed in a trench coat and blows away  his teacher and six of his classmates to the satisfaction of his friends, has since gained much notoriety for this 1995 film due to the fact that it inspired the Columbine Massacre, which took place the day before the 4th anniversary of its release.
  Scenes of Jim describing the rush he felt during his heroin highs are vividly portrayed.--Perhaps the image of him running through a field of poppies  symbolizes  the opium the plants produce. But inevitably, his addiction creates tensions between him and his mother, who is eventually compelled to kick him out of the house.
 A scene of Mrs. Carroll praying to the Virgin Mary to watch over her troubled son out on the streets evokes thoughts of St. Monica's prayers for her wayward son, St. Augustine in the early days of Christianity.
 Juliet Lewis plays the prostitute, Diane Moody, a drug-addicted acquaintance of Jim's.
 We see the seedy and violent underworld in which Jim and company partake, and at one point, while in a diner, see Jim's response to the success of his friend, Neutron has as an athlete, playing in a televised game,  realizing that he, too, might have been in that position.
 There will be one death, temporary assistance from Reggie in withdrawing from his addiction, which is painfully reenacted by DiCaprio, whose features go from ashen and vacant to bruised and bloodied, and back again, and a nightmarish sequence of a once-again stoned Jim submitting to a john he picked up on a subway(Tom Fitzpatrick) in a public bathroom stall, and hallucinating that his former coach, Swifty , whose advances he rejected, is laughing at him to his face.
 After a volatile confrontation with his mother, who rejects his pleas for money to support his habit from the opposite side of her front door, she calls the cops and has him arrested. He is sent to Riker's Island.
  Eventually, we view a sober Jim telling his story to an audience, en route to becoming a New York legend, faring better than his contemporaries.
 Of course, the coda to this story is Carroll's sudden death from a heart attack at age 60, fourteen years after this film's release, which could serve as a warning of how he might have had many more years were it not for his addiction.
 Whereas the story took place in the 1960s, this film makes it a more contemporary tale, interspersed with music from Carroll's 1980 debut album, ""Catholic Boy"". Dark, violent and gritty, it stands as a potentially useful tool in the anti-drug abuse campaign, hopefully keeping many from joining the ranks of ""people who died"" before their time.",1407715200,5,5472,4.949726775956284

However, in 2011, I saw the movie in full (uncut, to be more precise) on DVD. And now I can appreciate it even more. Aside from DiCaprio's riveting performance, I can see just how tragic the fall from grace had become. I can't be sure if Jim Carroll's autobiographical account is completely accurate in this film, but I don't think it matters here. The story, which involves sports and drugs and redemption, is compelling enough for me to recommend it. Fantastic performances from DiCaprio, Wahlberg, Hudson, and others. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.

Would I say that this film is perfect? Of course, not. It does have its few flaws (a couple of moments of lousy dialogue and overacting), but they're minimal and aren't distracting in the slightest. The Basketball Diaries is one that shouldn't be overlooked, as it has to be one of the most underrated films from the 90's.

682962,5,6303567126,"The Basketball Diaries (Scott Kalvert, 1995)
[originally posted 13Jul2000]

There are those among us, and they are legion, who consider Leonardo DiCaprio a one-dimensional actor capable only of playing slick Hollywood leading-man roles a la Titanic and The Beach. Such should be encouraged, or perhaps forced, two watch DiCaprio's two most powerful early performances: as Johnny Depp's retarded brother in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and as author Jim Carroll in The Basketball Diaries. DiCaprio's career may have taken a huge turn for the stupid, but in these two films, he proves himself a consummate professional.

I never associated the Jim Carroll of The Basketball Diaries, somehow, with the Jim Carroll whose 1985 cult hit ""People Who Died"" has become a mainstay of the classic-rock frat-house drinking party crowd. And the plot of TBD pretty much parallells the first couple of verses of the song; if you've got the hang of one, you'll get the hang of the other.

Carroll was a basketball player at a New York catholic school in the late seventies, being scouted by the majors along with a couple of his friends, growing up poor but honest, and an aspiring writer to boot. Not the world's most notable existence, but a good one, until the flirting with drugs that he and his three friends did got out of hand. The turning point is the death of his friend Bobby (Michael Imperioli, last seen trying and failing to save Summer of Sam) from leukemia at 16. From there, Jim, Pedro (James Madio), and Mickey (a young Mark Wahlberg, in the role that took him from cute boy-band idol into serious actor-ville) descend ever deeper into the world of heroin addiction, while their erstwhile friend Neutron (Patrick McGraw) serves as a yardstick of what might have been had they stayed clean and sober.

Next if you liked blow, harsh times or what doesn't kill you, you will like this, if you never heard of thouse  movies or didn't like them then this won't be for you. This isn't your standard predictable sports movie where they are down by 20 at half time get a cheeseie speech and they go out and win and the main guy gets the cutest girl in school. This is a true story about a kid that coulda been a state champ and got a scholarship to play at a college had he not gotten kicked out and thrown away his life chasing his next bag. This shows 1st hand what its really like to be a homeless drug using teen. Shows what he goes through his friends his mother, shows some 1 close to him that tries to help but gets burned and even shows what its like after you clean up and change you life around and run into an old using buddy that's still runin and gunin. Shows how easy it is to start out having fun here and there and the next thing you know you through your whole life away and wake up 1 day like how did this happen to me? I related do to my own story of drug use from 14 to 24 so when I see this movie I see me, so that could have a lot to do with why I like it soo much. No other movie comes even close to showing what its really like out there. If you wana see real life drama that will break your heart this is the movie, but if you want Hollywood explosions or happy endings with a story you can always guess whats happening next you might wana stay away from this, a lot of people don't like to see how the other half live and that's fine, but don't bash 1 of the best movies ever cause you have very basic taste in film",1371427200,,2018,3.921951219512195

682988,3,6303567126,"One major thing I was taught by my high school film teacher years ago was that when watching a film that was based off a novel, you are grading only the movie -- not the book. I agree completely. Staying true to a book's original plotline is not relevant in the reviewing process anymore. Leaving major plot points out -- or adding fluff that never existed -- are not necessarily indications of poor filmmaking. The film stands alone as its own work of art, and now it must be critiqued without acknowledging the novel.

That being said, here we have a slightly different situation. Jim Carroll's original epithet is not a narrative, fictional story -- it's his own diary from his adolescence, his own thoughts and observations he happened to jot down during those fragile times. It doesn't really bother me that discrepancies exist between his real life accounts and film, but it does bother me that those differences are the most major in the whole theme of the story itself, and thus had the audience miss the point to it all and replaced it with a cliche one.

Examples? Well, in reality...He didn't get clean thanks to Riker's. There was no Reggie to nurture him out of his addiction. He had a father and a sibling that provided for interesting experiences at home (but no, he has to be a lonely kid, to show why he did drugs!). Headquarters wasn't some run-down abandoned pile of bricks that anyone could crawl in and out of -- it was the apartment of some of his friends. And Jim actually did accomplish a lot of things while still battling heroin, including getting good grades, winning a scholarship to the elite Trinity and making it to the National All Star Game. Oh, and remember the scene where he barges into class in a dream and shoots everyone in the chest? That horribly cheesy adaptation was taken from an entry completely unlike it: In the journal he simply writes that sometimes he gets the urge to fire a machine gun off to his right side and directed upward when he's in a certain class, NOT particularly at anybody, unless they accidentally got in the way. It's a gentler and more intriguing way of handling such a desire for a release of tension. No need to show the angst-ridden kid going Columbine to make a statement. I'm sorry, but the story in the film was like a childishly simplified version of his actual life story, and for what purpose? To be another don't-do-drugs movie with the same formulas we've seen before.

Read the book to get a full glimpse of what I'm trying to say here, 'cause I could ramble on forever. Before you decide I'm incorrect, though, research Jim Carroll's own thoughts on the film. I've been a fan of his work since high school. Apparently, while he adored the performances and thought it was a well-made film (as do I), apparently director Scott Kalvert ""had no idea what my book was even about."" ""I said, 'You're not going to go and make it all messed up and preachy, right?' and they said no, and that's exactly what they did!"" All Carroll's quotes.

It became a cliche film about a cliche spiral down into drug addiction. The diary though had so much more substance, simply beCAUSE it was so real. There were gray areas, it wasn't all about drugs being so obviously bad but Jim's falling into it anyway because of angst, it was just so unexplainably fresh and original. I love Leonardo DiCaprio and this is a tremendous performance, and I was somewhat entertained by the film -- hey, there are some really good scenes. But you can't possibly read the original diary he wrote and then watch the film and decide it was an accurate portrayal not just of the facts, but of the true and original ESSENCE of the story and what he's trying to say.",1357257600,7,3703,4.56390977443609

683028,3,6303567126,"This strengths of the movie are:  competent acting by DeCaprio and a socially useful message:  drugs ruin dreams and lives.

In the movie, DeCaprio is not a bad basketball player; he has plenty of coordination.  However,  he is not even close to the type of high school athlete who in real life would be in line for a college scholarship.  He lacks the necessary muscle mass and skill development to even be considered for that level.  So the way the movie ends up looking:  the ""dream"" of being a college player (or beyond) was only in his mind.  Bad casting.  He's a fine actor but this was not the right role for him.

The scenes take place without much development so that the movie has more of a comic book feel than a serious movie.",1310256000,,738,4.392592592592592

683031,5,6303567126,"This movie remains among the best I have ever seen. Everything about it is as good as it gets. Before it is over you know that every single camera angle, every casting selection, every song used, and every location was somehow, perfect. Yet it doesn't come off as a polished Hollywood high budget film. The story and characters are presented in a believable way that makes your heart bleed even when they screw up, because they are that real. The real Jim becomes irrelevant. There are a million Jims. DiCaprio dug deep for this one, and so did his co-stars. I give a lot of credit to Director Kalvert and can't believe that he is a one-hit-wonder. This movie makes me want more from the man. Two scenes that were most incredible are when Jim's mom chains the door locking him out. Only his arm and face are visible through the gap allowed by the security chain. It doesn't take an addict to feel his pain. And at the same time, Lorraine Bracco is on the other side of the door and you know how bad it hurts her. Both put forth a superb performance throughout the movie, but this is where they shine. One must see it to believe it. The other scene is when DiCaprio, as Jim, is in Reggie's house alone having just come clean the day before. His demons return and the camera work in this short but important scene is magic. DiCaprio remains stationary while the camera spins. Each time the camera pans past him his state of agitation is increased. It was a great way to portray something that could otherwise have been a long drawn out boring sequence. Watch it, you won't be disseminated.",1292803200,5,1587,4.457044673539519
683042,4,6303567126,"I felt the movie was really good, but you do have to be prepared for the dark nature of the film, especially since it is based on a true story.",1289692800,,143,3.8
683043,2,6303567126,"Jim Carroll is a basketball star. He and his gang of friends get into gang fights and steal things in their spare time. When Jim gets involved in drugs, his life slowly start to deteriorate. More and more problems arise as he continues to get fixated and goes to more horrific and depressing extremes in order to get his next fix. The film details his descent from basketball star to full-fledged junkie. Based on the diaries by writer Jim Carroll, the film was in the making for several years before finally being released to mixed reviews in the mid-90s. Being a big fan of the book, I watched this film. This is what I think of it.

This film could have been great. Indeed, it isn't terrible. There is a lot to admire about this piece of work. For starters, Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. He displays a strong range of talent reminiscent of James Dean. His performance is definitely very memorable and extremely realistic. The soundtrack to the film is also quite top-notch and truly lends itself to the angry tone of the film. I also appreciated much of the early scenes in the film and I found many of them to have a true sense of gritty realism as well as a type of ironic detachment that you really don't see too often these days. Juliette Lewis, despite her role being very brief, does an excellent job as well and, had she gotten more to do, could have really been remembered for her role. The film also gets the look of the dank, dark, grimy streets of New York down pitch-perfect. You can really get a true feel for the atmosphere and the scum that pervades the life of Jim and of his friends. You really get a sense of the filmmaker almost being a witness to the type of depraved behavior depicted in the film.

Unfortunately, the flaws outweigh the positives in this film. One of my biggest complaints has to do with the terrible decision to change the time of the story from the 80s to the mid-90s. If there were any time period this film should have been set in it should have been the 80s. The film's soundtrack consists mostly of 80s music. The idea of 80s excess was a big part of the original book and almost lent itself to a kind of realism nearly on par with Less than Zero(the novel) in terms of it's graphic depiction from a boy whose love of life and of writing was corrupted by drug addiction and peer pressure. Unfortunately, the shift from the 80s to the mid-90s not only destroys any chance of any of those themes being explored, but also turns the film into nothing more than a mid-90s cautionary drug tale. The problems with the film, unfortunately, don't even end there. Mark Wahlberg and Ernie Hudson are known for some tremendous work in the past, but their performances in this film have to be some of their worst work ever! Mark Wahlberg is painfully one-dimensional and he manages to not even be able to do THAT right! His performance comes off completely too over-the-top and forced to the point where you cringe at his line delivery! This was before Boogie Nights, so at least he has an excuse, but what was Ernie Hudson thinking??? His character comes off as the stereotypical would-be hero who has been through it all and has made something of himself. It comes off completely fake and simply too cartoonish in nature. He was very miscast in the role and he is ultimately what takes the film down even further. My absolute worst complaint, however, has to do with one particular scene. While I cannot say what goes on in this scene, I will say that the way the filmmakers depicted it was far too over-the-top and extreme in it's nature. It's one of the most notorious scenes in the film, so I'm sure you've heard of it, the infamous ""bathroom stall scene"". Yeah, the way it is handled in the film is completely gratuitous and absolutely disgusting. It is the sole reason why I refuse to outright recommend this film. Many folks will likely attack me and say ""Oh, well that's how it really happens"" or ""Oh, well you've never experienced what that Jim guy experienced so you don't know what you're talking about"". Well, perhaps that's true. Perhaps I have never been a prostitute, nor have I been a drug addict. However, that does not make the scene less graphic and explicit than it needed to be. It's an absolutely disgusting and far too grotesque scene that was completely uncalled for.

As it stands, I can still appreciate the film because it does some things right. I did like the moments of humor and the little scenes that ring true about growing up and being admired by your peers. However, if you have read the book you will be seriously disappointed. The film was a bit too flawed for me to really enjoy or be intrigued by. It's a well-made film in a lot of ways, but I cannot recommend the film to fans of the book. If you are a fan of the book, you will hate this film. If you've never read it, check it out. You might like it.",1286409600,2,4880,4.4624860022396415
683044,4,6303567126,"As a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, I was excited to watch this movie for the first time. Not surprisingly, I enjoyed it immensely. The Basketball Diaries is a raw, harrowing account of young man's descent into heroin addiction. It's dark, disturbing, and painfully hard to stomach at times. It's another brilliant example that Leonardo DiCaprio can play so many more roles that sweet, love-struck boy from Titanic.

For the first thirty minutes, I had trouble understanding where this movie was headed. A bunch of Catholic school teenagers stalk the streets of Manhattan, creating small mischief. They appear harmless, headed in the direction of numerous basketball scholarships. Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Jim, writes stunningly beautiful poetry. However, things eventually go downhill. Through a series of events I won't spoil, Jim and his friends begin experimenting with drugs.

Everything changes. This seemingly light tale commences into a constant battle for another taste. It's hard to watch characters fall so hard. The Basketball Diaries turns into an unbelievably bleak story of what these chemicals can really do to somebody. The withdrawal scenes in this movie are some of the best I've ever watched. I was cringing for minutes at a time. I found this movie incredibly moving and engaging. However, the ending seemed a little rushed. The transition from drug user to clean, completely changed individual didn't come off realistically enough to me. Leonardo DiCaprio's character was so obsessed with the needle I had trouble believing his somewhat quick recovery. That being said, the rest of this movie makes up for it.

As a side note, I also thought Mark Wahlberg did a great job with his smaller part. He's a great actor, and always entertaining to watch.

683046,3,6303567126,"The final scene gives a brief glimpse of why we should care about this rather routine drug addiction film-noir, when we see Jim Carroll giving a reading of his writings. However, that comes 90 minutes too late to save what should have been an interesting biopic. The loss is now more poignant, given Carrol's recent death at age 60. Songs from Carroll's four rock albums dot the soundtrack, and the script is based on the book Carroll wrote at age 17 depicting his grim youth as a Catholic school drug addict in NYC. If only watchers were advised of these accomplishments at the film's beginnings, and then given a tour backward in time, the movie would have benefited. As it is, it's a lot of puking and screaming and fighting and writhing as the characters search for dope and/or go through withdrawal.",1263168000,,804,4.669014084507042

683049,5,6303567126,"Leonardo DiCaprio takes us on a journey into the agonies of a teenager on the worst path possible. This movie descends into the depths of depravity and sadness. DiCaprio, as another reviewer wrote ,amazingly was but 20 years old when he turned in this powerhouse of a performance. Little by little we see the way he gets into this lost soul and makes him so believable and pathetically authentic. One of the  best moments is when Dicaprio and the 2 buddies who followed him down into the sewers of human existence see the young man who
was a part of the gang but he stayed clean and persued his dreams as a basketball player. He is up there on the television living a healthy happy life than any of the three others could have shared. The look in Leonardo's eyes says it all, even in his drugged up state there was a miniscule possibility that he could get himself together and return to a decent life. Another wonderful scene was when the actor Ernie Hudson, takes DiCaprio home, seeing himself many years ago in a similar crisis and wanting to do the right thing to help a fallen friend. That was heartwrenching with DiCaprio deprived of heroin having a meltdown while Hudson tried to be a support, ignoring the most disgusting behavoir by Leonardo who looked like a wounded bird just trying to make it through the next 15 minutes. Also as brilliant as DiCaprio is Lorraine Bracco, who we will always of course think of as Tony Soprano's shrink, playing DiCaprio's Mom with love and she too has her own emotional meltdown in that wonderful scene where she is on one side of the door, and he is leaning in across the chain, desperate for a few bucks to feed his habit. She is forced to call the cops on her own out of control son. Of course this movie is based on a real man who found his way back to a happy and healthy and sane existence. How triumphant !!!  Mark Wahlberg gave his own gritty and skilled performance of a teenager as lost as DiCaprio. Painful, but well worth watching.",1253836800,2,1988,4.458791208791209

683076,5,6303567126,"I watched this movie many years ago.  I knew who Jim Carroll was long before I ever heard of The Basketball Diaries.  When I saw the movie I did not even realize that Jim had actually written these diaries.  Personally I love reading other peoples diaries or watching them on a movie.  It makes me feel good to know that other people out there are just like me.  Don't get me wrong I have never been hooked on heroin, but I was once in the ""major"" partying scene for a very long period in my life.  I knew several people who were hooked on heroin.  I chose at an early age not to do heroin, partly because it scared me and partly because my best friend told me she would kick my a** if I did (she saw what it did to her two sisters).  I was a little surprised at the Amazon review.  Maybe the guy is really young because everyone I know who has seen this movie knew who Jim Carroll was, even my sister who is 9 years younger than me and all her friends.  Considering that she grew up in the 90's I think that says a lot for Jim Carroll.  I am buying this movie because I have two sons, ages 9 and 11 and soon enough they will need a little taste of ""the real world"".  We live in a small community and there is not much ""reality"" when it comes to the world of drugs.  They have their annual drug talk and come home and tell my husband he is using drugs when he drinks a beer with a friend.  I am the real ""druggie"" in the household since I actually smoke cigarettes everyday (God forbid!).  This is what this town sees and thinks of drugs and that culture.  This movie is perfect for showing what actually happens.  Yeah, drugs are a lot of fun.  I am admitting the cold hard truth.  But everyone has to pay the piper, yeah I guess that is kind of a pun.  You stay with the peers and the drug culture, the clubs, the bars, the apartments and yes, even the basketball courts and the drugs will bring you down.  I find it amazing that there are actual people in this world who still care enough for other people to work hard to get them out of the drug scene.  Most people I know have just had to remove themselves from the scene or they would succumb to it once more, even when they absolutely did not want to.  The lure, the wild promise of a great time, probably one of the best times you will have had in a really long time is to much to turn down.  So while inside your screaming ""NO, NO NO!!!!"" your eyes are looking right into the eyes of ""the friend"" offering whatever it is you have done and are about to do again.  I really do not want that life for my boys but I can not be a hippocrite either.  Thats why this movie is the best.  Plus they can identify with Leonardo DiCaprio, both of them watch Titanic at least 3 times a year!  I hope this review helps someone.  I hope it helps in whatever way you need it to help.",1233964800,,2826,4.0414414414414415
683077,4,6303567126,"Shortly before he died of a drug overdose River Phoenix was asked what he was going to do next. He took a dog eared copy of The Basketball Diaries out of his pocket and said he wanted to play Jim Carroll. The Basketball Diaries project did get made, except with Leonardo DiCaprio instead of Phoenix. At the risk of being typecast River was set to follow that by playing the poet Arthur Rimbaud in Total Eclipse. DiCaprio picked up that role as well. The Basketball Diaries turned out pretty well for Leo, and was also a good break for Mark Wahlberg. There was however one unintended consequence: the students at Columbine copied not only DeCaprio's black trench coat, but also his violent fantasy of shooting up the school.

Copy cat killers are a large problem for film makers. Oliver Stone tried to make a statement about violence and how it was glorified in movies and the news media with Natural Born Killers. Result: Copy cats. Seems like Stone fell right into his own trap (Juliette Lewis is in Basketball Diaries and Natural Born Killers, by the way). Take Taxi Driver as another example of what can go dreadfully wrong.

I don't have any answers but am just pointing out the pitfalls for an artist who tries to address serious social issues with a very powerful and seductive medium. The Basketball Diaries also had to be careful not to glorify heroin. It kind of did in the first part, but then it tried to make up for it in the second part by showing a lot of puking and screaming--which is good as a cautionary tale, but it doesn't necessarily make for the best feel good movie of the summer.

On the other hand, I also feel that the book that Jim Carroll wrote was misrepresented by the movie. Stephen Lang turned down the part of Swifty the basketball coach that went to Bruno Kirby because he felt the book was misrepresented. But that's Hollywood for ya. They made it into much more of a standard cliche plot, a cautionary tale, more like an after school special.

Still, there was a lot to like about this movie, and the Jim Carroll story is quite a compelling one. Though at a young and tender age he was a petty criminal, heroin addict, and prostituted himself to support his drug habit, he managed to turn it around and become a successful poet, author, and rock musician. Carroll was also a high school basketball star, which can't be easy when your double life is a junkie. He also had a cameo in The Basketball Diaries playing, what else? a junkie. So, add acting to his already impressive resume. Also, though they tinkered with the book somewhat, there is plenty of verbage lifted directly from it, and his prose style always lifts the material above the mundane.

-------------
Jim Carroll: And it's good that there is rain. It clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions, and it clears the streets of the silent armies... so we can dance.
===========================

The basketball scenes are exhilarating, as are all the early scenes before the negative effects of addiction take hold. Besides a great performance by DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg also acquits himself well, as do Michael Imperioli and James Madio. Imperioli plays Bobby, a basketball star buddy of Carroll's who is dying of leukemia. Madio plays Pedro, who although too short to play on the basketball team, is nevertheless kind of the team mascot and a member of the gang.

Music plays a vital role in the film, and the song ""People Who Died"" is especially effective since Carroll wrote and performed it, and some of the people in the lyrics, like Bobby, for instance are the ones in the movie, and Carroll's own real life. Also great are Patti Smith's ""Dancing Backwards,"" ""Riders of the Storm"" by The Doors, and the musical high point for me, ""Down by the Water"" by PJ Harvey. Her album, To Bring You My Love, had just come out in 1995, the year the film was released, and though the song didn't yet exist at the time period the movie was supposed to be in, it nevertheless managed to capture the feeling.

In a stunning portrayal of James Carroll, DiCaprio leads us down the path of adolescent destruction  caused in part by adult abuse, negative peer pressure, a shaky home situation, and one's own self will. This is definitely not your routine jock-sports movie. In fact, the movie's title may actually steer some potential viewers away from purchasing it. No, this is the real thing,scenes of which this reviewer saw too many times in his career. The path to drug self destruction is different for everyone. In Carroll's case, he somehow survived, accompanied by his urine stained notebook/diary. Would a trustworthy adult or counselor have been able to prevent all the mayhem? Possibly.

Watching all the struggles Jim has to go through- loosing friends, trying to be clean & then failing, prostitution, begging for money, getting into physical fights.. - it is hard to watch and you physically can't believe that someone can go through so much and come out victorious in the end.

The movie is quick and the screenplay is hard hitting and incredibly entertaining. The most gulp inducing scene in the film features Jim crying outside his mom's appartment before getting arrested. It always strikes me how Di Caprio has this superhuman side to him. He can undertake any role you throw at him. The end of this movie was heartening and inspiring in a way.

My other favourite Leonardo Di Capro films are  Aviator (absolute 5 starrer) Catch Me If You Can (of course you've seen it) and Titanic(overrated? hell no) He also happens to be my favourite actor besides Tom Hanks.

The better scenes in this movie involves the induction of supporting cast Mark Wahlberg, who makes the movie even more realistic and hard-hitting. It's a simple story of a frustrated adolesent taking drugs in prep-school suffering the torments of phedos such as the Coach and his teacher.

The movie overall was entertaining but leaves you wondering at the end where does the character go from now and where are the other prominent characters of the story.

683122,5,6303567126,"I must admit this movie really had a huge effect on me. After watching this, I thought to myself, ""How could anyone do drugs like this?"" The look of this film matches the tone of it, which is a dark, gritty feel of the streets of Brooklyn during the 1960's.

This movie basically takes a real life teenager and throws him down the wrong paths in life. You can really see Leonardo DiCaprio's character grow more and more addicted to all these drugs. Physically, you can see his body become worse and worse as he becomes more plugged into the drug culture as nights go by.

I have a whole new appreciation for Leo DiCaprio. He was only 20 years old when this was made and you can tell, this young kid can act like a pro.

This film as a very indy-film look to it which seems to add to its realism unlike if it were a major Hollywood motion picture. So, if you want to see an emotional, tearjerking view of innocence crumbling into nothing, this one will suck you in.",1120780800,14,964,4.256830601092896

I thought this movie was perhaps a fun look at life as a teenager.. boy was I ever wrong. It was not about diaries and there was very little basketball involved. I was hoping for an inspirational story about a boy who came out of a rough neighborhood, wins the state basketball tournament, gets the girl and receives a full scholarship to Harvard, while recording these life changing moments in his diary. However, none of those events happened. I guess next time I will read the back of the movie to save myself many months of nightmares and therapy.",1118361600,5,674,4.4

Having such a dubious association I was reluctant to view this film.  Having now seen it I can see my reticence was unfounded.  This is a gripping account of a talented teen, Jim Carroll(Leonardo DiCaprio), and his descent into the hell that is serious heroin addiction.  The film depicts how even the best of us can be insidiously seduced by our innate desire for kicks to try such a horribly addictive drug.  DiCaprio, who has since matured into one of our finer actors with his role in ""The Aviator"", shows early signs of the promise since fulfilled.  Mark Wahlberg is also good as Carroll's best friend who also falls into the heroin trap.  Good turns are provided by Lorraine Bracco as Jim's concerned mother and Ernie Hudson as Reggie, Jim's best friend even if he doesn't know it.  The film's biggest flaw is that ostensibly it's set in the sixties but it doesn't seem to have a feel for that era.",1117152000,2,1073,4.64021164021164

The voice over in the film really drags you down into the world of a junkie. The slow empty boring world. (To me its like sitting in on a wet sunday knowing school is the next day...that horrible dragging out feeling, knowing that you have to go to school the next day and hating it, and the whole day reminding yourself of the homework that has to be done and your trying to sit yourelf down to do it , but you couldn't be arsed.)

I started watching the film and I thought, oh, this is a kids movie. The next thing I knew, Dicaprio was snorting cocaine with a hot chick who promised him the coke would make him superman in bed.

And that's when the film grabbed me because I knew then that the kid was going to end up hooked. The film then depicts just how this happened to a promising young basketball player, who made way to many bad decisions in his formative years.

683150,5,6303567126,"To those who have not experienced the world of hard core street drugs and the violent consuming grip they can have, I point to this movie as maybe the quintessential performance of an individual addict. Trainspotting and other movies may cover a drug, or a lifestyle better, but nothing captures the tragedy of an individual like DiCaprio's performance in Basketball Diaries.  The defining moment is DiCaprio, pounding on his mother's door, begging for $20 so that he can score just one more hit.  His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, huddles on the other side of the door, crying, and fighting the maternal instincts to help her son, when she knows he can not be helped.  The cry that Leo gives out, as he pulls his cap down over his face in frustration, a sixteen-year-old crying for his mommy, because it all hurts too much to cope.  That is the face of addiction.  DiCaprio's cry comes from his belly, the whiny tantrum cry of a four-year-old who just can't understand why he can't get his way.  And yet, underneath that, one gets the sensation of the turmoil and pain within his heart, and the ultimate sadness that eats away at him.

This movie introduced me to the beautiful and edgy work of Jim Carroll, the star of the latest Beat generation.  His story is so captivatingly told through the performance of DiCaprio.  However, the supporting cast is also spectacular.  Mark Wahlberg deliveres a great support perfomance, as a cohort in drug addiction, helping to supply pills, glue, heroin, and the like.

Keep an eye out for an early performance by Michael Imperioli, of Sopranos fame, playing a teammate of DiCaprio and Wahlberg, who passes away during the film.  Yet one more devastating event in Carroll's life.

There are some stylistic choices made by the director that may not fit with some people, but they are only a minor detail in a very powerful and honest film.",1098835200,,1884,4.76

Obivously the big draw in this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. I have to say, he does an outstanding job with this role. In the true story of drugged-out high schooler Jim Carroll, he thrives on the type of script Academy Awards are made out of: tons of opportunities for him to be high, low, enraged, in sorrow. There are a lot of opportunities to use his physicality in the role, and he seizes every one. In particular I think of his drug withdrawal sequence and he and his friends' mourning the death of a close friend by getting drunk and playing basketball in the rain.
The plot has a sixteen year old Jim Carroll playing high school basketball. Three of his teammates are his best friends, and when not on the basketball court, they tend to find all kinds of ""innocent"" trouble around New York (knocking over food vendor carts, for instance). Another outlet of energy for Jim alone is his diary where he records sensations he feels in his young life.
His search for sensation and his friends' desire to find trouble coalesces in experiments with drugs like cocaine and herione. As Jim notes in the monologue of the movie, there is no such thing as a part-time addict. They fall further and further into the downward spiral in an effort to evade pressures from school teachers, coaches, and parents.
Some of the scenes in this movie are very gripping and visceral. However, the links between these scenes tend to be bogged down in poor directing. I realize this movie was a lower budgeted one, but there really is no excuse for having a movie made in 1995 that looks like it was made in 1985. While the performance by DiCaprio is extraordinary, the directing is lackluster. Poor camera angles, helpless lighting, bit part actors who look and sound amateur; those should all be blamed on the director.
However, this movie is worthwhile if you are one who has a particular interest in either Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg (he stars as a main character and one of Jim Carroll's best friends), or the subject matter. I have to say I thought ""Trainspotting"" handled the subject of drug use extremely well, but this movie is right up there in the ability to depict the sensations felt by those addicted.",1068595200,5,2406,4.610722610722611
683154,5,6303567126,"The name Jim Carroll may not be familiar to mainstream, radio-friendly listeners, but to those who know about rock poetry and Punk Carroll is one of the genre's greatest word-players along with Patti Smith and has recorded two especially noteworthy works, ""Catholic Boy"" and ""The People Who Died,"" which sound like wonderfully gritty hybrids of beat poetry and Punk rock. ""The Basketball Diaries"" is based on Carroll's novel of the same name which is a testament of his days living in the streets of New York during which he became addicted to heroin, saw friends either die or spiral down into self-destruction and eventually found his talent for words as an exit out of the hell he was trapped in. As a movie, the story comes alive with a powerful impact. Director Scott Kalvert does not make the movie into an obvious anti-drug message, instead the story of Carroll's teen years is simply just...told. There is almost a documentary-like realism in how scenes are put together, nothing feels false but instead chillingly real. Anyone who has lived in an environment like this or attended high school in the more gritty, violent sections of a city can instantly relate to the people and events. The actors bring these characters to live with great believability, Leonardo DiCaprio broke through with this role, but even his recent work in films like ""Titanic"" and ""Gangs Of New York"" seems more tame compared to his brilliant, effective performance here. The scenes where Carroll is addicted to heroin and lives in the junkie underworld are performed by DiCaprio with a vivid realism that is disturbing. One reviewer here complained about the movie missing a plot, plot is not something central here, the story is central and it is the story of a very talented young man gripped by addiction in a world where vices and the darker side of life can easily suck you in. And of course, there is some great music here by Soundgarden, The Doors, The Cult and a great highlight which is Carroll performing ""Catholic Boy"" with Pearl Jam. In the history of rock music there are many popular stories of addiction from Iggy Pop to Scott Weiland, Carroll's is brought to life in a movie that breathes and doesn't need to throw the message in your face, the message is right there in the story itself.",1067644800,,2289,4.7974683544303796

Anybody that has never done the things that go on in this movie might not understand the way drugs take over your life.

I'll admit, when I first saw this movie I was a prepubescent wanting to capture Leo in all his glory at the height of the ""Titanic"" craze. I didn't get this movie at all the first time I watched it, but I could sure tell it was graphic, violent, and at times, very sickenly disturbing.
It took a few more years till I could digest ""Diaries"" and appreciate it for what it really is: an indie movie with strong performances and grit.",1060646400,,579,4.471698113207547
683199,3,6303567126,"Although Leonardo DiCaprio shows some amazing depth and vulnerability here it can't save the movie from becoming redundant.
When there is a plot, the movie does very well: a young street punk goes bad due to the various pressures of school and life.  But once he goes bad, so does the film.  DiCaprio's performance is extraordinary, but how many times need we watch a junkie lay on the ground and ask for money, even if the performance is extraordinary?  We see his character sinking lower and lower, until rock bottom is hit, and then is hit again, and again, and again.  All right, he's at the bottom, we get it.  Perhaps it was complete truthfulness to the real-life story, directed that way to help the tragedy sink in for us viewers.  Sink it did.

But the movie is good nonetheless.  It's certainly gritty, realistic and very hard to watch at points.  Bruno Kirby is particularly icky, with a sadistic smile that could make you hurl.  It would work very well (almost up there with ""Requiem for a Dream"" in this aspect) as an anti-drug video for schools.

In fact, the only reason I was able to handle such cheesy and girly-type movies like Titanic, is because I had seen DiCaprio in this movie beforehand, and had deduced that he was already an amazing actor.  The scenes in which he was detoxicating from the drugs are utterly amazing, in fact they are so real and life-like that they make you feel Jim Carroll's (DiCaprio) desperation.  But the best scene is when he is crying through a chained door to his mother for some money.  Wow.  The only persons who would not find this movie sincere and life-like are persons who have never left their sheltered academic existences, which seems to be the case in most of the reviews I have thus far read about this movie.  Someone asks: ""Does anyone know what it is that Jim (Leo) finds in the drawer of his friend's place, after the friend rescues him from freezing in the snow?""  Hello!  The point is that we have to imagine that Carroll is telling the story to us...Therefore, we have to assume he didn't quite remember what he took, or that maybe it was not important enough for us to worry about...The point is that it was something small, and perhaps insignificant since in the end his friend is part of the audience which is listening to the reading of his diaries.",1052784000,2,1312,4.483193277310924
683201,3,6303567126,"The 1995 film is based on the autobiography, published in 1978 by Jim Carroll, about his descent into heroin addiction as a teenager.  Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a Catholic school student, it shows him enjoying being part of a winning high school basketball team, sniffing glue and taking part in petty crimes.  It's set in a Hollywood version of a gritty New York Manhattan neighborhood, and, as a New Yorker myself,  I must say I was confused about exactly where it was.
DiCaprio writes poetry in a notebook and visits a dying friend in the hospital.  I guess that's supposed to show how sensitive he is.  There are also some supposedly moving scenes where he is strung out on drugs and begging his mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, to give him some money.  However, in spite of his tears and his rantings and ravings, he never became a sympathetic character to me.  Maybe it was because of script, which didn't let the audience know exactly what it was that either turned him to drugs or made him stop.  And maybe it was because he just can't stop being Leonardo DiCaprio.
Mark Wahlberg is cast as one of his pals, and so is James Madio.  And Julliette Lewis has a small part as a young prostitute.  All these people are just background though for DiCaprio, who is in every single scene and whose character dominates the film which is blissfully only 103 minutes long and moved fast enough to hold my attention.

Leo DiCaprio is very compelling in his role as a basketball star turned junkie as you can really feel his traumas. Mark Walhberg plays a good foil for Leo as his thug partner.  Bruno Kirby is his usual steady self as the basketball coach.
Many of the scenes are not too pleasing with drug addicts rolling around looking for their next fix.  In addition, the rampid theivery and misbehavior by Jim and his thug like friends is a bit overdone.  Its a wonder how children with Catholic School upbringings turn out so misguided.

The reason for the success of these films is that they are genuinely good. After you got past the effects, was Titanic, Gladiator, Pearl Harbour, AI or Independance Day really that good? In fact, Pearl Harbour has many people's votes (although not mine since I'll admit I haven't seen it myself) as one of the worst films ever made.
Basketball Diaries is a gritty and low-budget film. This doesn't shy away behind special effects or fancy graphics. What you see is what you get. The story is a harrowing tale of drug abuse, which starts with low-class drugs like glue...and works it's way up to heroin. I think it is actually a true story, which makes it all the more chilling. When it starts it reminds you of yourself growing up - the first time you may have experimented, had sex or did something dangerous; how you behave with your mates. But it becomes detatched, showing you the harsh reality of what can happen when relatively harmless drug dabbling turns into a daily addiction.
All in all, Basketball Diaries is brilliantly executed film. It certainly shows DiCaprio's greatest performance that I've seen by a mile. If you want happy endings and sugar coated fun look elsewhere.",1026432000,4,1366,4.7196652719665275

683237,4,6303567126,"What is spectacular about ""Basketball Diaries"", you ask?  The acting, for one, is superb.  Leonardo DeCaprio is at once, cool-minded, suave, insightful, and, (playing a character who was once revered for his skills on the basketball court and in writing but who faces a serious drug problem), deadly accurate in playing the role of what drugs and taking a wrong turn can do to a person.  The plot starts off pleasantly enough.  Leo is an aspiring writer living in the poor side of New York City.  He is a star athlete who hangs around three buddies---all with goals of mischief, basketball, and being just boys.  One fateful night, one pal introduces the easily influenced Leo to drugs and sex......and the plot then focus almost exclusively on his  downward spiral of a new life filled with drugs, hustling, theft, and homelessness.  He, along with another addict friend (played by Mark Walburg---who is also a serious character actor and excellent), quit school, leave home and turn into thugs.  The aspiring writer can no longer function; he is derilict, dependant on herion and crack, and without a family.  And it is here that DeCaprio displays a superb range of acting skills.  He is so believable in his reactions to life on the streets, in crack houses, and the wild display of emotion, of self-hatred, of dispair is beautifully portrayed.  In fact, I found myself often shaking my head at the life thrown away.  Though the story ends on a positive note and with a wake-up call, the themes of how a single life can take a disasterous turn in one night is strongly felt.  I agree with what one other reviewer says: the message of this movie actually ""screams"" to teenagers that drugs are evil, as is throwing one's life down the drain, along with all hope, opportunity, and a potentially bright future.  Between the acting, the storyline, and the turns in plot, ""Basketball Diaries"" is a great movie.  I highly recommend this intelligent film.",1004486400,,1950,4.828313253012048
683238,5,6303567126,"Leonardo DiCaprio is definitely not my favorite actor of all time. Yes, I am a teenager, and yes, I'll admit I was madly in love with him when TITANIC came out but not so much anymore. Now I just respect him as a good actor. I saw THE BASKETBALL DIARIES on Broadcast TV a few years ago so I really don't remember the entire film and probably didn't see the actual whole film because I am sure parts of it were edited out. But from what I remember, this is an excellent film. Yes, not many people know who Jim Carroll is, but that's not really the point of this whole film. The point of this whole film was a teenager who got addicted to drugs and what happened to him. The main character could have been anybody, really. There are lots of young teenagers and kids out there who are addicted to drugs and this is the kind of thing that can happen to them. I think that is what director Scott Kalvert was trying to show the world...not a story about Jim Carroll, but a story on how drugs can affect your life and everyone else in it. The entire cast of THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is absolutely superb, especially DiCaprio (who stars as the young Jim Carroll), Mark Walhberg, and Lorraine Bracco. The filmming is excellent, and the story and plot are unique and amazing. I love THE BASKETBALL DIARIES and strongly recommend it to everybody...and I can't wait to see Leonardo DiCaprio hit the big screen again this winter in GANGS OF NEW YORK! :-)",1003881600,2,1439,4.373134328358209

683240,2,6303567126,"This movie portrays a number of teenage students who quit school and become criminals and drug addicts. That could be quite interesting. What ruins the movie is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in the lead part. He is quite annoying in all his movies but in this one, it goes to extremes. He is so overacting and after a while my brother and I started laughing when he cried and at his facial expressions. All the close up shots of his face don't make things better. His character is supposed to be 16, I believe. Leonardo DiCaprio was actually about 20 but looks like 14. The only character I really cared about and felt sorry for was his mother (Lorraine Bracco). The sequences that are supposed to show what is going on in Jim's imagination could have been better made especially the one where he's running though a field of flowers.
Like I said, the lead performance makes the movie quite annoying to watch. It's also a bit dull and it doesn't have anything new to say. I guess those who enjoy watching DiCaprio's overacting will find it very good, but if you don't, stay away and don't waste your money.",987292800,2,1107,4.567839195979899

Leonardo DiCaprio's superbly gritty performance proves he's not just another pretty face; he truly is a really talented  actor.

683248,5,6303567126,"Director Scott Kalvert creates a moving and realistic recount of the true story of Jim Carroll, played superbly by Leonardo DiCaprio, a New York City teen who at the height of his high school basketball career, falls victim  to drugs and violence in the rough streets.
Look for the real-life Jim  Carroll who makes a cameo appearance as a crack addict in the scene where  young Jim sitting in a back alley listening to the addict preach about his  ""high"" while boiling his fix.
Fine supporting performances by  the entire cast and a musical score including original songs performed by  Jim Carroll's band.  Especially memorable is the acid-rock message song:  ""These Are All the People Who've Died"" which is a tribute to  Jim's fallen friends throughout his life.
The serious messages in this  film SCREAM out at teens, but also are sombering to adults who realize the  sometimes hopeless devastation that wracks a family during a drug crisis.  Your heart breaks for Jim's mom and his mentor, an African American  ex-druggie who cleaned up and wants nothing more than to help Jim out of  his living hell before it consumes him.",949276800,48,1127,4.832460732984293

The juxtaposition of Carroll's confined claustrophobic catholic world vs. the allure of the street and heroin isn't that shocking in the context  of todays headlines.
