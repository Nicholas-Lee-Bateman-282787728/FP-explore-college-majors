Poetry to the television world.  And the acting and stories, like MASH or West Wing, ripe for the cultural season.  Can't wait for season 2.",1346112000,66,297,4.528301886792453
5243628,5,B0092QH902,"Brilliant, Briskly Intelligent Writing was the title for this review when this enormously successful series premiered in June 2012. For some reason Amazon did not make this available either on Video On Demand or in a place where reviews could be written. Now the first season is complete - having finished last night with one of the finest shows of the season. And with the soon to be released DVD set of the first year, we can finally discuss it. To start with, the following response was to the first opening show:

A new series launched on HBO with a star-spangled episode `We just decided to'. As conceived and written by Aaron Sorkin it is a timely, incredibly intelligently written show populated with some of our best seasoned actors as well as some very fine actors on the way up. This is the kind of television that reminds us that at one time the news programs informed us about current events and ran a continuing commentary on the development of events in this country and around the world in a manner that kept us alerted of why we as a nation needed to remain alert to both good and bad events, to celebrate when indicated and to fight back when injustices were occurring. This direction is indicated in the background imagery for the titles - running glimpses of the likes of Walter Cronkite, Edward R Murrow, Huntley/Brinkley etc who were responsible news anchors instead of the flippant celebrities more concerned with ratings of their show than the news we see today.

The first episode opens with popular news anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels who proves his acting chops here) being interviewed on a college campus and responds to a student question `Why is America the greatest country' by answering `We're not. We used to be' and then runs us past our history of reportage on television that proves that the country has fallen in world view because we no longer care about our initial basic rights and freedoms and concern for humanity. It is a powerful start with some of the most gut-wrenching insightful history of this country that has been written for television

From there, McAvoy returns to his station to find a support team missing and a replacement named. But enter an old flame, the war correspondent fatigued Mackenzie MacHale (Emily Mortimer, never more brilliant) who has been assigned Will's new Executive Producer, and in the midst of many changes the new arrangement (not a popular one for Will) evolves into a return to actual news reporting of the significant type - all over the 2010 BP oil explosion and spill that threatened the Gulf of Mexico. It is raw, real, factual, and immediate news delivered with veracity and commitment.

From this initial episode the series takes on the most significant events that have affected this country in the last 2 years - the major Wall Street disaster, the activity of the Tea Party sector of the Republican Party, the political party with which Will is aligned but in the final episode, after recuperating for a severe bout of depression, he returns to his place at the news desk in the final episode `In Name Only' and ends the season with a diatribe about the current status of his party berating them as a party for their ideological purity, compromise as weakness, a fundamentalist belief in scriptural literalism, denying science, unmoved by facts, undeterred by new information, hostile fear of progress , a demonization of education, a need to control women's bodies, severe xenophobia, tribal mentality, intolerance of dissent, and pathological hatred of the US government. 'They can call themselves the Tea Party, they can call themselves conservatives, and they can even call themselves Republicans, though Republicans probably shouldn't. But we should call them what they are, the American Taliban.'

Greg Mottola and others direct with keen precision, allowing moments of comic relief to be present if subtle and keeps the momentum of the show propelling smoothly. The cast of superb actors includes John Gallagher, Jr. (brilliant), Dev Patel, Allison Pill, Sam Waterston (never better), Thomas Sadoski, Chris Chalk, Trieu Tran, Charlie Weirauch, Margaret Judson, Olivia Munn, Adina Porter, Hope Lange, Jane Fonda - and more. A more talented and committed cast would be hard to imagine. THIS is the kind of television series we so very sorely need right now. It is refreshingly free of the usual clatter and gimmicks that clutter the airways, and it is full of information and food for thought delivered in an entertaining manner. It is simply and unequivocally brilliant! Grady Harp, August 12",1346025600,244,4589,4.939119170984456
5243639,3,B0092QH902,"First - I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY wanted to like this series. It is cerebral, it has great actors, it makes you think a little while entertaining you; it isn't written for the lowest common denominator.

However, despite all of the positives, the writers still failed to pry themselves away from their deep seated liberal ideology.  They portray the media as noble but the writers fail to be honest in the end. The premise of the series is that the media has some sort of epiphany and suddenly obtains character and integrity. On top of that, the writers try to appear balanced but just cannot resist making liberals appear to be intelligent while taking cheap shots at conservatives. It's subtle but pervasive, like when they portray the main character's Republican past as a negative that needs to be hidden or spun.

Then, when the story wanders away from ideology it falls headlong into romantic tension. Half of the story is attempting to tell you that the press really is noble and the other half is a full blown soap opera. If they added anymore sexual tension or romantic interest, you would think it was a reality TV show set in a high school.

Newsroom had GREAT potential and once again the liberal mindset of the entertainment industry just couldn't trust the viewer to sort out the information on their own. The viewer is constantly being told that being liberal automatically makes one smart and adhering to conservative values makes one evil and dull.

Jeff Daniels does a great job. The supporting characters have depth although they look as if they drawn out of a politically correct  lotto machine, They have females, African Americans, Asians, Indians, Blue collar white guys, you name it. The casting oozes diversity to the point that it is almost comical. I was almost waiting for a lesbian single mother in a wheelchair to appear in some episode so the producers could check that box as well.

The use of real events as the backdrop for the news stories was brilliant. The writers don't need to explain what the events are and can focus on the story line. Unfortunately, they  couldn't pass up the opportunity to also tell the viewer that conservatives were either to blame for the events or couldn't possible be intelligent in each and every one of those stories.

I watched the entire first season so that I could give an honest and informed opinion. I continually hoped it would get better and it never did. If anything, the episodes became more like soap opera episodes throughout the season. I hate to say that the earlier episodes showed the best writing and the quality only decreased as the season went on.

You don't have to be politically correct and edgy to be entertaining and thought provoking.

5243648,1,B0092QH902,"Watched 4-5 episodes. It got off to a good start, with some interesting characters and relational dynamics (and some that were cheesy as well). Some good acting by the lead actors, which made up for some of the poor acting of those playing lesser roles. The premise was promising, but as the show progressed it became clearer in each episode that Sorkin didn't care to live up to what the show claims, that news should be reported with integrity and in its context. The show dives into several news issues but only covers them from one very limited perspective and out of context, yet they come across as if they got the real story. In essence, the show criticizes major news outlets for nor reporting news fairly, yet Newsroom itself is guilty of pretending to report news fairly but clearly doesn't. It's a classic example of being hypocritical- claiming to do one thing but doing the opposite instead. It was actually sad to watch because they had several good pieces to place to make this a great show.

I watched this because I love shows and movies set in the journalism field.  I also watched it because it was created by AARON SORKIN, whose work I love.

It's got a fantastic cast, great storylines and is binge worthy, the video equivalent of a page turning book.  It's a wonderful ensemble cast that includes some actors whose work I knew of as well as younger actors with whom I was unfamiliar.

It had a good premise in the first episode about just the facts and not taking one side or another and then spent the rest of the first season bashing anything conservative out there. Ended up just being another liberal loving, conservative loathing cuss fest that was briefly interrupted by really hilarious characters and some very funny dialogue, but the lopsided political junk was too much.

5243695,5,B0092QH902,"I have not watched a series anywhere that was done so perfectly as the Newsroom. I am not sure how true to how a News TV that does shows like Sean Hannity (which I love) is done behind the scenes but I imagine in order to be trust worthy it has to tell the news in the only way I believe is ethical. With that said it takes a lot of people to do vetting, get the story right and you are not allowed to make mistakes. This show is exactly how I wish all news shows would be, where ratings mattered but most important the TRUTH! Every actor was amazing on their role and I fell in love with Will as I cant imagine anyone who could of done this role but Will (Jeff Daniels, he deserves an award) as he played it perfectly and exactly how a News Anchor should do his job) Also, the chemistry between him and MacKenzie (Emily Mortimer) was very sexy but done in a classy way. My second favorite couple was Maggie & Jim and I was on pins and needles waiting for them to get back together. It was a great love story, an awesome team who tried to do the News with integrity and was never boring, Lastly but one of the most important characters was Charlie the head of the team. He too was sensitive, caring and kept his word to always put truth first, I think it was a masterpiece and I was sad to see it end, but the ending was amazing (I cried)! It had everything suspense, love triangles, office relationships and the original teams trust amongst each other. You will fall in love with them all especially Charlie as he is like the Good Godfather of all the people who worked for him. If you don't watch this show you will miss a great opportunity to learn a lot, plus it was very entertaining. Today with all the Fake News and the sex scandals that are being revealed everyday it just makes you realize that reporting the news is a job that if not done with the upmost integrity can ruin lifes and change decisions that effect the world. I was hooked by the first episode and what Will said. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did. Kudos to HBO for outstanding job, just wish it would of been longer! Would of loved to see the Trump election as the last episode.",1515024000,,2160,4.145238095238096

5243727,5,B0092QH902,"Only Aaron Sorkin himself could write a sufficiently eloquent review of this series; one that would definitively capture the magnitude of greatness of the writing, the acting, the editing and the choice of subject matter for each episode.  I have no expertise in writing quality or specific knowledge of broadcasting, but by the 4th episode found myself genuinely disappointed at the realization that this series ended after only 3 seasons.  It is incredibly good--poignantly topical, exceptionally thought provoking, and undeniably effective at reminding us of the potential beauty and insight that can be conveyed with such an exceptional and deliberate choice of language.  I think anyone could enjoy and appreciate this show, regardless of personal politics, or one's opinion of the role and result that the media has played in all of our lives.  The goal of this script seems not to lecture the audience with Sorkin's opinions about government, politics and the media--instead it appears to strive to get us to actively consider and reflect on the ways in which we all are affected by these dominant forces in our lives every day.  We are all affected by these things and likely have considered many of these themes in our own lives at one point or another, but generally move on all too quickly to other thoughts, because the details of our daily lives take a front seat to these seemingly philosophical reflections. And rather than preaching his own opinions to us, I thought Sorkin seemed to be imploring us to think critically about the things that affect us, even when it's easier to move on to the practical necessities of issues that are more tangible in our daily lives.  And I found the actors to all be impressively believable in their roles, as well as the editing/directing choices to be impressive.  It was also very interesting to consider each of these major events from the past decade from such a different perspective of a newsroom as the knowledge of such events was breaking in real time, as opposed to the perspective that we the audience experienced as we learned about them from the various media outlets.  There are too many reasons to watch this series; more than a typical review could possibly address.  And too many perfectly timed metaphors and references to prioritize them.  Although I think my favorite (admittedly for purely personal reasons) was the episode in which the staff all lined up to donate personal checks to Will, as a contribution to the money he had personally paid in order to free a captured free-lance journalist abroad.... straight out of the movie ""Rudy"", which is a tough choice to effectively reference/copy and not fall short of success at meeting such a massive emotional response  But this episode was brilliantly successful.  It made me appreciate Sorkin that much more for thinking of it as a way to communicate his message with his script.

While the observation was intended as a negative one, it was merely accurate.  The pacing, the conversational overrides, the carefully timed lulls into which telling outbursts were dropped, all had the marks of a well rehearsed stage play.

Unfortunately and ironically they must have felt the need to dumb down the rest of it to appease the audience because a lot of the relationship and social interaction scenes are often annoyingly silly and too theatric.  But I tolerate that and watch the rest because I enjoy the news coverage part of it.
Besides the melodrama, the other thing that really bugs me about the show is that it has women often slapping, hitting, or otherwise acting violently towards men. There is a name for that...it's called assault or domestic violence and I wish that shows like this wouldn't trivialize it.",1503273600,,781,4.686131386861314

Why does this newsroom get to all of the stories first? Why is it another damsel in distress disguised as a strong media personality? Why is it another ""damaged"" male trying to make his way in life? Really awful. I tried to get past the seventh episode, but wow. Awful. At the point when the Newsroom ""guessed"" the news was about Bin Laden, I was out. Not recommended, tries too hard. Could have gone far but landed way too short.",1503014400,2,636,4.352941176470588

These were supposedly highly articulate and educated people with very quick wit and sharp tongues talking at a rapid pace, but then when it came to their personal affairs, they fell apart like a grammar school child, their responses and conversations were ridiculous and very uncharacteristic.  The characters became a huge disappointment one by one.

As far as the news aspect of it. I'm not sure if its a parody of the ignorance of the likes of MSNBC, or not. I can say that if you employ just a little common sense, not to mention Google, you will find the news segments are sophomoric at best. Half truths, lies, ignorance...you know, the liberal media. I don't even think the dog crap in my back yard believes some of the stupendously transparent lies. For instance, they tell this heart wrenching story of a woman in Tennessee who couldn't vote because she doesn't drive so couldn't get a licence. She could however go and get a state ID for $12.50 that never expires because she's a senior. The same ID she would need to cash a check, go to a lot of doctors, and pick up most prescriptions. They said Obama never apologized to another country. These pesky facts...the Obama apology tour in Egypt, Europe, Turkey, and Cuba as well as in front of the UN which consists of 193 sovereign states. In every episode there is a newscast, there is at least one lie in it.
Watch the show for its compelling storylines, its acting, and the interactions. Its funny at times, and has you wanting to watch the next episode. The speech Jeff Daniels gives at the beginning of episode 1 is amazing. PLEASE don't watch it to get your news.

The foul language, especially the taking of the Lord's name in vain, was too much for me to tolerate. Also, by that time, some of the characters were very obnoxious, phony, unrealistic.
I switched to the HBO series about John Adams and was uplifted by a plot that actually was about the law, justice, the pursuit of liberty...and the people didn't curse God once in the several episodes I viewed. In fact, I was strengthened by watching actors portray men and women of integrity from our very own history.
The writers and director responsible for Newsroom ought to view the series on Adams and get educated....
Furthermore, I have to say that I have noticed in several current TV programs, Bluebloods, NCIS, Blindspot, e.g., there is no foul language.

Season 1 seeks to inspire with Will's quest to bring civility into the ""public square"" of cable media. The backward looking format that includes news of the recent past allows the viewer to put those events in context with the storytelling.
Although some reviewers (possibly rightly) knock the show for female characters that are cartoonishly inept with some aspects of their lives, those characters are also brilliant, strong and the soul of The Newsroom and the fictional show they produce.
Season 1 makes a great case for being well informed and getting information from reliable sources, something relevant to recent events in the US. Engagement, Civics, just giving a damn about what's going on in our country is important. Sorkin makes the case that good citizenship requires that we be well informed and that we must be wise consumers of the information available to us.",1485820800,,1071,5.022471910112359

This was a great show with real emotion and real people (characters). It was awesome how it followed the actual events that were happening at the time the episode took place. That makes it authentic.
If this had been broadcast on one of the big 4 networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox) I believe it would have had a huge following. Even on a cable network. Yes, anywhere but a pay network, like HBO, each episode would be about 5 min shorter to remove all of the F$*k's alone. But it was still a show that was killed too soon.

The entire cast is brilliant and are brilliant together. Jeff Daniels is by far made for this role. Emily Mortimer is a brilliant ying to Mr Daniels' yang. Who ever doesn't like Sam Waterston is just wrong. Dev Patel is a brilliant shining light (who is currently starring in a movie that is heralded as a masterpiece). A couple surprises for me: Someone I was unfamiliar with, John Gallagher Jr, was perfect in his role. Thomas Sadoski who starts out as an ass, really turned into a hero by the end of season 2, but you end up rooting for him way before that. And an absolute gem: Olivia Munn. Her comic delivery and timing coupled with her character's very straight and narrow persona quickly turned her into my favorite character. Season 2: News Night with Will McEvoy - watch it.

Closed minds will be unable to truly understand the nuances of the plot lines, no matter which side of the pol-spectrum they are on. It will merely be a knee jerk reaction.  Even though the series was created and premiered in June 2012, the issues and concerns that are addressed do, in fact, parallel and apply to today's America (01/2017).
Jeff Daniels does a masterful job of changing from an innocuous ratings driven cable TV news anchor to a real newsman a la the greats, Brinkley, Cronkite, Murrow, Koppel, Rather, Walters, Couric, etc.
The Iconic scene that sets the tone is the opening scene where Will McAvoy (Daniels), joined by two other journalists(?)  is at Northwestern University at a town hall meeting with the students.  He evades definitive answers to questions posed to him until the moderator  finally calls him on his non-answers and insists that he give a real answer.  The response/speech he gives is truly amazing and undoubtedly will last for ages.

Jeff Daniels won me over and then some from the second he gives an answer to a wide eyed co-ed at a seminar to ""why America is the greatest country in the world."" His answer will make you want to laugh historically and weep simultaneously.  The actress who plays Jeff ' s EPA is precious.  Or perhaps it's her character.

5244950,5,B0092QH902,"Fascinating series! Jeff Daniels owns his role so well it's hard to even see him as an actor. Deeply immersed in his role, his character's faults and foibles not only come through, but do with an increasing predictability. What's charming about them, though, is that the viewer is taken on a journey with him that ultimately reveals the factors of his past that have played into the making of the man and so his faults become points of viewer sympathy and empathy. The dialog is very well written. I've read criticisms of other cast members but ~ and perhaps this is influenced by how thoroughly believable Daniels is ~ I find the whole thing believable. Every character has identifiable strengths and weaknesses. It's Daniels' character that carries the phenomenal strength of this series. I didn't find it until the series had tragically ended so I've had the pleasure of binge watching. I'm already dreading the end (currently in season 3) because his character is so compelling, I'd love to follow it way longer.",1483315200,,1016,4.878612716763006

5244955,5,B0092QH902,"Newsroom is one of the best HBO series everdone. It is witty, funny and informative. Will McAvoy the lead newscaster is a veteran newscaster with a background in law who is disallusioned with the publics taste for voyeurism and tolerance for being mislead by mainstream media. Add that to the fact that his network chief having just hired his ex girlfriend McKenzie as his new executive producer and then couple that with a bunch of millennials he also has to work with who while extremely talented come with their own personal dramas.

But then again it is Aaron Sorkin who although a great writer can be a little preachy, especially about guns.

5245349,5,B0092QH902,"AS one might expect from writer Aaron Sorkin (who also did much of the best writing for THE WEST WING), this is one of the most intelligent, insightful, and honest shows I have ever seen.  It depicts the moral and economic challenges and conflicts television news organizations face every day in addition to verifying sources of information.  It challenges the motivations of all news organizations in the same way that the best churches challenge their congregations: to live a courageous and moral life, to stand up to bullies and the easy temptations of profit and cronyism.  While doing this THE NEWSROOM also reveals the humanity of its characters, the personal and professional conflicts, ambitions, and jealousies, the internal conflicts (popularity or truth?), how honor might be expressed, what unconscious biases we all contain and how they impact our personal and professional worlds.
This is a 2-season morality play on several levels.  It inspires one to think and feel as well as to be entertained. I applaud the clever writing, the excellent acting, the engagement of the entire team and the engagement it created in me. I felt like a member of this team.

I have never ever identified so strongly with characters in a fictional story. Ever.
The Don Quijote-mentality. Living in a world long-lost, fighting for ideals that seem so obivious (to me! ;) and having this constant urge to express them, to 'give monologues - everyone does that where I work' (quote character Maggie Jordan). I have worked, as an expert in a different field, for a tv-show, full time for a couple of years. This show makes me realize I should have become a journalist. The speed, the drive to communicate.

The characters are well-crafted, lovable in all their imperfections. The stories are intriguing, thought-provoking. Watching it after the last election (2016) provides wonderful commentary as to what happened, but not in hindsight.

Whatever you do with your time on Earth: WATCH THIS SHOW!

5245603,3,B0092QH902,"The Episode 4 story about the shooting of Arizona congressperson Giffords was a make believe created by the OweBowMao administration for two reasons.  Most important was that she had been instrumental in his passage of the felonious ""Affordable Care Act"" to compel Americans, in violation of Article V of the US constitution Amendments which prohibits taking the lives, liberties, and properties of any American citizen without due process of law, to assure payments to the ""wrongful killers"" of more than 250,000 Americans per year.  Second was that the real target of the narcotics infested gunman was the actually murdered *judge* who had been ruling in favor of the ""civil rights"" of ""illegal immigrants"", a major offensive against the narcotics pushing criminals who infest the criminally blighted state of Arizona.  Giffords had been only an ""innocent bystander"" who, along with others injured in the successful attack against the judge, was shot by the same gunman carrying out his assigned task.

That the hour long telebitchin show followed that politically manipulative script is a demonstration of what has been going on with ""the media"" since roughly 1987.  It was in that earlier year that the gutting and looting of all of the equity of those formerly great publicly owned corporations via the felony theft of the ratable property of continuing stuckholders was commenced by His British Lordship the criminal mastermind Greedspan under the euphemism ""stock buybacks"".  Long before this show was created by Wholly Weird, that gutting and looting had created a mechanism for absolute control and censorship of all of ""the media"" through the mechanism of the feloniously foreclosing bunkos whose ""lending"", entirely of the stolen incomes of elderly interest income dependent retired, has been the only thing allowing any of the media to buy their printers ink or electricity or to pay their corrupt ""reporters"".  Fail to understand that underlying corruption of ""the media"" which this telebitchin show glorifies, and it becomes a mockery of the American people who receive only censored and politically manipulated ""news"" when provided with anything at all.",1480291200,,2168,5.321637426900585

5245769,5,B0092QH902,This is a very exciting series built around real news events including real clips with a fictional story about a newsroom that (unlike all news programs) tells it like it is. In the middle of all that are the frustrated love lives of the news people. It also lambasts the right wing (Tea Party) of the Republicants while at the same time shows value in some moderate Republican values. I can't stop watching it.,1479254400,,411,4.5675675675675675

5245802,5,B0092QH902,"If you enjoyed West Wing, you will love Newsroom; same style, same writer, Sorkin. Similar to West Wing, Newsroom takes a page from todays news and replays them with Sorkins liberal patina to inform conservatives that they have been suckered by the Tea Party, Koch Brothers and so on.  The implication is, conservatives bad, liberals good. West Wing rewrote history for Bill Clinton, spiffed up his fumbles and mistakes, explained away negatives.  Newsroom does the same for todays events.  Beautifully acted and directed, fun to watch.  Liberals can bask in their brilliance (as told to them by Sorkin), conservatives can roll their eyes, but the show is entertaining nonetheless - five stars.",1479168000,,694,5.169642857142857

5245869,5,B0092QH902,"Just a fantastic show. I prefer the stories and moments based in adult drama, and find cutsie jokes (likely directed at a much broader audience) a bit irritating. Still, there are so many powerful scenes in this show, it's worth waiting through the bits about Bigfoot and McKenzie' s flustered incompetence act.

Sorkin made McAvoy a Republican just so his liberal views would be more palatable to conservative viewers. Daniels' character is basically Sorkin's wet dream of how a conservative newsman should behave. Not really a shortcoming, just the reality of the show.

The writing is top notch and the banter between the actors is sharp and often amusing.  All the actors portray their characters well.  I was surprised to feel invested in the characters lives after the first episode; usually it takes a few episodes for me to become comfortable with them.

My absolute favorite part of the show is his female characterizations; every single woman is smart, articulate, highly feminine (Jimmy Choo's and all), insanely courageous, and deeply flawed. The show's male characters are every bit as flawed, smart, etc as the females. I cannot recall another television show where all the male & female characters are treated as total equals in every aspect of their (shared) lives. The females are portrayed as being just as powerful (in every way) as the males. And the men are not made to look like fools in relationship to the women. In fact, these (relationships) are some of the most healthy, truly loving adult relationships I've ever seen on the small screen.

5245977,5,B0092QH902,"Season 1 of ""The Newsroom"" has, by far, the most engaging start I have seen in any TV series.  And I was born in the 70s and grew up in the 80s.  My generation knows about TV.

Warning: this review may contain spolers

This season starts with the premise of a very smart news anchor, who, for personal reasons, decides to get a conscience, and drags his production team with him.
Every episode is frame within a specific, real life event, from a marathon bombing to the capture of Bin Laden.  Each one of them is filled with the drama one can hope from events that changed United States history.  They end also, with Will McAvoy editorial as the closing statement from the episode.
Even with the internal drama derived from the characters personal dilemmas, you cannot help but be touched by their reaction about the shattering events they are reporting about.
In one of the episodes, part of the production team is stuck in a plane while the events about the killing of Bin Laden are unfolding.  One of the producers is complaining about not being able to get down from the plane to do his job, until he sees the captain, and realizes he is traveling in a United Airlines plane.  His attitude changes immediately, from a really annoying person, to a moved individual who cannot help himself, and with the outmost respect, simply tells the captain that Bin Laden has been captured.
This season, all the historical facts are treated in a serious and respectful way.  Although the following two seasons would be excellent as well, these history based episodes are only used on the first one and initiate what would be, although very short, one of my favorite series.
Do yourself a favor, and watch this, you won't regret it.",1478649600,,1722,4.6381578947368425

The conceit of watching a fateful story develop only to have the date of that big news event appear later is engaging. The dialogue is heavy-handed or over-produced or whatever you'd call it when you can't suspend your disbelief for even a moment because it feels too contrived. But the retrospective take on real world events that are only just fading from memory redeems it enough that The Newsroom has become a show that I hate myself for liking.",1478304000,2,564,4.885416666666667

5246326,5,B0092QH902,"First let me say this up-front: The Newsroom is an idealization of what the news ought to be in the Internet age.  In this series, Sorkin essentially rewrites how the major stories of the day (BP oil spill, the financial crisis, the assassination of Osama bin Laden) ought to have  been reported.  And (even though he does give Will a conservative thought or two) Sorkin writes about these and other issues from a liberal perspective.  So thats one problem.  The other is that he never really comes to grips with how a news organization is supposed to make money in the Internet age where everyone has a voice.  (As you can readily see because you are reading these pearls of wisdom on an Internet site.)  And when Newsroom does try to tackle the whole money question it fails rather miserably.  Lucas (the billionaire who buys the Atlantis Cable News and tries to make it into something a kind of over-the-top Fox is treated with the utmost disdain.  But then the old billionaire-owner (Leona) didn't get much sympathy when she merely tried to use her news network for political influence.  So, money (or rather the need to make a profit) is not an issue that is treated with any seriousness here.  This is an idealistic series.

Having said that (and there are a lot of criticisms that can be and have been leveled at Newsroom fairly and perhaps not as fairly), it is an absorbing show.  I think there are two reasons for that.  First of all, while it definitely has a liberal bias, it is not a blindly liberal bias.  There are several characters (Will is a good example) of conservative points of view.  The show side-steps the whole GOP infighting by having Will bemoan how his party is being hijacked by the Tea Party (and who thereby lower news standards) but he does express what are legitimate conservative concerns about the GOP and the world at large.  But more than that, the characters on the show are all to a greater or lesser degree deeply flawed and deeply committed.  And as a result, they both exemplify the forces that are tearing us apart right now and, at the same time, because they are forced to work together (and hence talk to one another) in order to produce this one show, they somehow find exactly the right response to any story as it happens.

Their responses to the oil spill and Osama bin Laden perhaps encapsulates this better than anything.  That, and the really good acting made me sit and root for the characters.  And it kept me watching.

And yes I know all the criticisms.  Its liberal; in real life they would have gone off air in a heartbeat because really who watches actual news anymore? Etc. But a part of me rejects that.  Because wouldnt it be nice if I could turn on the news and get the Newsroom?

And until we do well, theres the show.",1477526400,34,2784,4.531062124248497

Character development is a bit scattered  and the Pill character is really just that an annoying pill. She wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes in a newsroom. For people who are so decisive in their professional lives , they are annoyingly uncertain about their personal ones.
I'm sure that makes for interesting viewing for those who enjoy the :""drama"" in a relationship, but I do not share that sentiment.

What they really are is a ultra liberal news cast. In the show, they mention that the show's audience thinks the newsman is liberal, but he counters by saying he is a registered Republican. The key word here is, ""registered."" He says this to try and convince himself that if one registers himself as a Republican, then it balances out that everything he says is liberal. That somehow makes everything he says fair and honest. It is kind of like CNN. They know their ratings are in the toilet because they are so liberal, but they don't care because their goal is not to inform but to preach their liberal agenda.",1476921600,,777,4.440559440559441

The acting is excellent with a well put together cast and the writing flows naturally with scenes masterfully cut.  It is one of the rare shows that makes one think as the material is timely and realistically presented.  The characters and their interactions in seeking out, analyzing and developing the news are well portrayed and the plot(s) intricately woven and the technology and behind the broadcast scene dramatically and truly shown.  A lot of human interest and egos play a large part in every episode.  One caveat is that there is a one sided political bent which in itself is a realistic version of the news media's overwhelming point of view.  Sorkin's background would portend that.  Lack of political balance aside the running conversational barrage and events of news life and personal interaction make this worth the five stars.",1476921600,,936,5.038961038961039

5246550,5,B0092QH902,"The true virtue of this short lived series from HBO beyond its stellar performances, the quality and intelligence of the writing and the sophistication of its humor is that it manages to accomplish in reality the very thing that it addresses fictitiously. Namely; it gives us an accurate and unbiased (as much as that it possible for entertainment) account of real events that we never got from the national news media.  It doesn't address everything but it puts so much of what's happened in the first years of the new millennium not only in the spotlight but under the magnifying lens that the Fourth Estate once held as an indispensible tool.  A tool that was shattered when news media became just another facet of the entertainment industry and manipulated by corporations for their own selfish ends.  We are not only given a glimpse into what journalism was when it was considered a quintessential part of American consciousness but shown just how far away from being truly informed we have come in the last 20 years.  The only drawback is how sad or angry you feel when you realize that such things no longer exist in the real world.",1476835200,,1139,4.737373737373737

5246822,5,B0092QH902,The Newsroom presents news professionals on their most favorable light. Storylines are timely and the action sequences allow viewers inside access to the newsroom more than ever before. Well cast and well written will keep you in the mix and on the edge of your seat.,1475798400,,267,4.826086956521739
5246833,5,B0092QH902,It is a very exciting series.  The characters are portrayed superbly by the actors.  I find this series very entertaining and look forward to the next season.,1475798400,,158,4.814814814814815

5246835,5,B0092QH902,"Really great. Worth watching. Even though the start of the show takes place about 6 years ago now, watching these episodes lets you relive those moments in history, and go through the accompanying emotions again. As always, Aaron Sorkin's writing is fast-paced and entertaining. However (and also like always) his writing is misogynistic, and this Newsroom script especially casts women as intelligent (but never more intelligent) props to their ""brilliant"" savior male bosses.",1475798400,,477,5.5479452054794525

I'd give it 5 stars if the writing didn't show such contempt for anyone who doesn't think like a democratic pundit. If you can handle the mostly right-bashing but compelling high speed dialog this drama is lots of fun to watch.

Jeff Daniels and Sam Waterston portray involved, believable characters that strive to be the news organization that informs, rather than panders to, the public.  The major characters bring recent news stories into sharp focus, and their commitment to that task is often at odds with the chaos in their personal lives. Aaron Sorkin does a first-rate job writing this political drama.",1475107200,,445,5.3428571428571425

I wouldn't say I'm a Sorkin fan in general, but this particular show is really clever and incisive, and was an interesting look at the action behind the scenes of a news show and what it takes to put the outwardly calm anchors on the air every day.

The Newsroom gleefully sets up offensively ill-researched ""conservative"" arguments and vitriolically takes them down as if conservative Christian ideals and men who support them are morally bankrupt, corrupt, idiotic rubes (the irony is almost too much to bear). The series cannot even be watched for the drama of the story lines, romantic intrigue, etc., as the the mockery of people unlike themselves (radical progressives) emanates from every scene, with disdain simply dripping from most lines in the script. While fellow radical progressives may find this series edifying, it is unwatchable for anyone with moderate-to-conservative leanings and insulting to the intelligence of anyone of any political persuasion with any interest in objective truth.

The insights as to how news broadcasts are produced is great (even if they may be overdramatized), but the best part is the character development and relationships, and how the characters react under extreme pressure.

But after 5 episodes I really had more than enough. I do believe the show did a good job of highlighting the pompous dogma of the ""media elite."" I didn't even mind the biased worldview espoused by these people when it was part of the story-line.

Even my husband who normally does not watch TV has become a steadfast fan. Jeff Daniels and the entire cast have an interaction that seems to extend beyond the screen - that makes for great shows that last.

5247380,3,B0092QH902,"Newsroom is tireless in dispensing preachy dialog that seems to be written to inform and warn us. It does, instead, insult those of any opposing viewpoint. The main character, played by Jeff Daniels is supposed to be an angry Republican trying to make things right. The show is slanted to make conservative Republicans appear to be petty, uninformed bigots.

I liked the characters and got involved in the story line but by the end of season one I was tired of the arrogant bashing.
I will not watch season two, if it is produced",1474675200,,529,4.627659574468085

The writing is beyond genius in that it will leave you with thinking about the world of news and politics as you begin to see it in a different light. For individuals who enjoyed the honesty and brilliant writing of The West Wing, here is its equal.
The cast is eclectic, and comprised of actors and actresses that you have seen in various roles, but none like this. And before you realize it, you will have finished Season1, and will lose sleep until you start Season 2.",1474675200,,570,4.438095238095238
5247382,3,B0092QH902,"A fascinating look at what an American TV news room must be like as news comes throttling in each day and the hectic manner in which it must all come together in a controlled, correct and well-organized manner.  I thoroughly enjoy each episode, especially as it uses past actual events in story lines, which is great fun for those of us who do follow the daily news rigorously and can recognize and place events with presidents, etc. presiding at that time.  The insistence of the main character to report the news with integrity speaks to some TV newscasts today that do not.

My one negative opinion is that the personal love relationships between the news team members can get a little ""draggy"" and I reach my boredom level probably sooner than most viewers and just wish the main story line would return.  Otherwise, a pretty great series!",1474675200,,843,4.714285714285714

I believe the show has broad appeal because he resonates with a large number of people while minimizing any conflicting points of view on certain subjects.  There is never any question of what Mr. Sorkin believes about this world or which side of the political spectrum he falls but it was an engaging cast with quality plot lines.",1474416000,,504,4.7701149425287355

Aaron Sorkin please, in the name of all that is holy, come back to television as soon as possible. Our brains are being destroyed by inferior language and what passes as "" must see TV"".  We need thought provoking storylines that prompt discussions at the dinner table and the water cooler. The Newsroom, especially Season 1, is a wonderful behind the scenes look at how a nightly news report is put together, both from a technical perspective and a moral one.

5247576,3,B0092QH902,"Started as a show with so much promise. Yes the script is well written and the acting is award worthy but the content is a bit dissimulate. It starts off and proclaims itself to be a centrist view running for no nonsense facts and truth and turns into a leftist defense platform littered with drama, almost as if it's using the same devices of entertainment value to attract people to opinionated views that ""Will"" and the team so despise. The show designs a world where Joe Lieberman is a Republican and anything farther right than that is ""The American Taliban"". It is too bad the show that ""The Newsroom"" is about doesn't follow through on unbiased reporting as it claims to champion, maybe then this series could be an actual catalyst for change in the news world rather than a redundancy of the media today.",1474329600,,812,4.606896551724138

If your guilty pleasure is any reality trash, this show is not for you. Stop reading this and go back to the Jersey Shore. For the rest of us, this show is smart, quick, and intelligent. What I love most about Aaron Sorkin's writing ( he's the writer of the show...if you didn't get that in the previous line) is that he leads the audience to the denouement but doesn't reveal it immediately. He gives his audience the benefit of the doubt that a few may be able to figure it out without the help of the actors reciting a soliloquy. However, for the rest of us average folk, we receive a nice and neat package of what happened. And it's not demeaning our intelligence. Ok. My intelligence...which is lacking thanks to my offspring.

The message, the only Good Republican is a Liberal Democrat. The greatest irony is that the ""theme"" is ""pure news, pushing the envelope, real iconoclasts"" but it replicates the one party,  totalitarian mindset of the Liberal press to a T.

5247876,4,B0092QH902,"Great cast, well written (actually very well composed dialogue) and an above average ensemble chemistry all make for an engaging viewing experience while exploring the 'what if' of the existence another cable news organization that fell ideologically right of CNN and to the left of Fox.

The riveting re-reporting of actual news stories from the past several years heightens the drama.

If your ideological bent is to the right of Fox, be forewarned that all of your fears about how the reporters have an ideological axe to grind will appear to be proven with this show.  If your passions lean to the left, you'll feel very vindicated in the scenes where groups on the right side of the aisle are pilloried with regularity.

But remember it IS a drama. While using current real world events as a plot device, it has many redeeming aspects in accurately representing how news is reported in the real life career.

As a full blown tech geek myself, their inclusion of the production studio as a cast member is both interesting and fascinating. Their use of smartphones, social media websites and the ubiquitous apps -much as we all now do nowadays - is another strong touch for their take on realism.

If you only watch the first 10 minutes of Season 1 Episode 1, you'll easily see the intensity of the script-writing by Aaron Sorkin and the considerable acting skills of Mr. Daniels.",1473897600,,1383,4.7899159663865545

5248054,5,B0092QH902,"I have to admit, I am a journalist, which may be one of the reasons I like this show so much. However, with that said, all the usual accolades apply. The characters are interesting and developed more in each episode. The plot moves quickly but remains easy to keep up with. The acting is superb. All in all, this show is one of those you can get lost in and have trouble waiting for the next chapter.

Negatives - or maybe not:

Foul language is common and too often over the top. ""F"" bombs are thrown around than in a military ready room. I complained about this to a friend one time and they said it makes the show realistic, ""Isn't that what they talk like in real newsrooms?"" The answer is no. They don't talk like that in real news rooms. At least not any I have worked in.

So I don't share the show with my kids - and I wish I could.

And the negative or not? While the lead claims to be a conservative nearly all the causes he champions are generally liberal. I guess the writers just can't help themselves. I don't mind. It is better than the stereotypical Archie Bunker character that conservatives are usually cast in.

Regardless, one of my favorite shows",1473552000,,1167,4.310502283105023

A few dragging episodes in between really good ones made ma take out a star from what could've been a perfect five. But overall, it is a show I would highly recommend. Thought provoking indeed.",1472774400,,350,4.661290322580645
5248478,5,B0092QH902,"If you have ever become a little sleepy while watching any of the current leading network news programs, perhaps there may be a good  reason behind your lack of alert, engaged, attention. This series is a hypothetical counter to the way news is too often delivered today, as entertainment driven by ratings. It is not a perfect portrayal of insuring an informed electorate, but a very good attempt in the right direction. I have watched both the first and second season twice now, and continue to be appreciative of this ""what if"" drama about news that transcends the often shallow and banal broadcasts touting themselves as news these days. If you admired the commitment of Edward R. Morrow and Walter Cronkite to integrity, honesty, and the pursuit of an honorable calling, that of keeping the public informed regarding news that really matters, try this HBO series out for at least the first episode. It may just renew your faith in depth reporting, and a hope that more of it will begin to flourish in these troubled times that requiri everyone to employ their best informed critical thinking.",1472774400,,1097,4.866310160427807

It's not too preachy, but definitely gets its point across. The point is always made in a serious, but light-hearted way. A good watch. The opening title screen song seems a bit dated for modern audiences, but I'm assuming they used it to attract older demographic.",1472428800,,420,4.5394736842105265

5248793,5,B0092QH902,"This is the most intelligent show I've ever seen produced in this country. The writing and directing are top-flight, with plot lines so intricately interwoven that we, the audience, are genuinely drawn deeply into what truly feels like a real-life drama, in that so much of what we know and learn of the characters and their complex relationships is based upon seeming events that took place out of our gaze-just as in real life. The way they accomplish this is purely brilliant!!! An additional aspect of the writing that puts it so far ahead of anything else coming out of my old stomping grounds is that the dialogue and the characters' values are such that each actor has the leeway to be great-none are  too constrained by a need to adhere to any audience pre-conceptions. From one writer to another: Aaaron Sorkin is AWESOME! But my last substantive comment requires that I segue to an appreciation of the acting & direction. I've always been a fan of Jeff Daniels but, as Will McIlvoy, he spreads his wings as I've never seen before. F'ing fantastic! And I've appreciated Sam Waterston immensely, particularly in the original ""Law & Order,"" but I find his performances here so much more  delightful because they reveal the emotional &intellectual complexities of his character far more effectively than was done in L&O. But the show would not be so terrific were it not equally due to the outstanding work of all the other actors. ALL of them. I don't know which of the three lead women I adore more as each is so rich and real that their physical appeal does not get in the way. Even Olivia Munn's off-the-charts sexuality doesn't keep the viewer from feeling her very real vulnerabilities and haven't we all worked with someone like Maggie who is as charming & insanely cute as she is insecure? And Mac is just....WOW!!!! But not too over -the-top as I knew women at my old law firm  who had her intense idealism combined with an amazing, but quite believable, ability to juggle a thousand & one stressors and pull it off [nearly] every time. Furthermore, while 99% of what is on TV is totally unappealing to me, watching  ""The Newsroom"" not only does not require that I take a very hot shower afterwards to cleanse myself, but it forces me to confront many vital issues in politics, media and current society with which I am already grappling every day, so this show is so very much right in my wheelhouse!! Finally, as with great literature and top-flight motion pictures, I enjoy each episode more with every successive viewing, with seemingly always more to notice as I slap myself on the forehead and scold myself for having missed it before while my eyes well-up with emotions as I feel connected to what is going on before me as I never before experienced watching but a mere TV show. Until I saw ""The Newsroom."" P.S. Sucks that it was on for but 3 years! REALLY sucks!",1472256000,,2885,4.662082514734774

If you have strong right leanings this show is not for you, however if you are willing to listen instead of react and listen to the speeches you might understand how parts of the GOP have felt disenfranchised with the way things are going.

Predictably, there are soap opera elements around the love lives of the characters, and those need to be kept in check as the series progresses, but my main issue is the blatant liberal slant--and I'm a long-standing Democrat.  This has got to be the kind of show that gets conservatives (by today's definition) screaming about ""left wing main stream media.""  I don't disagree with a word that's being said, but if journalists are to be objective, is this an example?

I'll keep watching--am halfway through Season 2--and hope scripts don't start to include bizarre, unlikely events to ""maintain viewer interest.""",1471564800,,768,5.31404958677686

Alison pill and her improbable live life have less

5249465,5,B0092QH902,"Say what you will about Aaron Sorkin's political views, the man can write.  Whether from the right or the left, the ""news"" today is a 24/7 media machine that is neither impartial nor truly informative.  We hear what the often so called newscasters ""think"" and which celebrity did what outrageous thing today.  What we need is factual news reported with an eye toward informing the public about events that effect our daily lives and long-term world view.  Stories that rise to the level of news must be serious enough that they

Although plainly presented from a liberal perspective, Sorkin used events, clips, and quotes that easily showed the bias and hypocrisy of various political factions, especially the Tea Party and certain screaming heads claiming to be sources of truth and fact.

Overall, this first season was a blend of drama, humor, and political commentary about the state of the world with a little satire and sarcasm thrown in for good measure.  He employed an excellent cast to convey complex stories, though he sometimes has trouble writing consistent female characters and reigning them in over time.  It was refreshing to see favorite actors who have entertained us for many decades sharing the stage and working naturally with younger, less well known actors.

The series used topical stories that had already played out, so we weren't surprised by the episode plots.  Instead we were engaged in the way the stories developed, how they were presented, and the way people reacted to them.  I highly recommend the first season of ""The Newsroom"" to everyone.",1470700800,,1577,5.003831417624521

Suffice it to say that after enduring the first season, I'm debating a return of the other two. That said, if you're looking for a heavy dose of 20-something relationship angst and just plain stupidity, machine gun dialog bordering on the unintelligible in spots with the occasional paroxysm of righteous indignation -- on ""air,"" no less -- press that ""buy"" button and gorge. If Sorkin's little passion play bears any relationship at all to the real behind the scenes machinations of the television news business, and I presume it does given what I understand to be his preparation, then a mystery is solved: I know why I don't watch broadcast ""news"" any more.",1470441600,,784,4.64748201438849

I haven't watched a show this good since Jericho, West Wing, Sports Night and a couple others.  Such great writing and acting in this show.

The pilot was so good that it overshadowed the subsequent episodes until you got a sense for the cast's places and what to expect from them. For me, that took 3 or 4 episodes in and by the end of the season, you either loved this series or had already left it for something else. I loved it and stuck with it until they announced that it wouldn't be coming back after the next season.",1469923200,,555,4.196261682242991

5249857,4,B0092QH902,"An engrossing and lively show. The content was date-correct and interesting. The characters seem real and well motivated. Good acting, generally. Some of the interpersonal relationships were uninteresting and slowed the pace of the show. I was unsure of the roles of some players, they seemed to jump positions. Those poor people in the control room were cut-outs rather than real people. I guess with so many people involved, some had to be ""invisible"" to the action. I did enjoy the show, at least the on-air stuff. If it were not for the ""cut to the chase"" sections when news alerts occur and everyone has to shift into action and work as a team, this could be just another wannabe show. Good premise and has promise if more newsy drama ""cut to the chase"" pops up to wake  up the audience and stir in the adrenaline into the dramatic play.",1469923200,,842,4.613333333333333

5250177,5,B0092QH902,"I never pay for HBO et al on regular cable, but I remember seeing previews for this show when it first started.  As I am a HUGE fan of Alan Sorkin's work (can we get a West Wing reboot?) I knew I'd love it and I do.  Now that it's on Amazon and included in my Prime Membership I've been binge-watching for about a week now.  Excellent.  Smart.  Funny.  Flawed, relatable characters.  Slow character and relationship build-up, but worthwhile.  Bumpy secondary love triangle-rectangle plot during season 1; hoping it cleans up in season 2.  If you liked West Wing you'll love this.  Will next be watching Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.",1469491200,,633,4.571428571428571

5250211,5,B0092QH902,"Hands down an amazing series to finish.  It actually is my new favorite show I've ever seen.  Prior being Suits to give you my preference tastes.

Why I enjoyed the series:
- End to end story is very well told
- All main characters are very well developed
- Superb acting from all major rolls
- Very relatable yet complex moments
- Intellegent and Heart Warming
- Displays the importance of integrity, loyalty, trust, and forgiveness

I highly recommend this series to both male and females.  If you found that any of the above is similar to your tastes, give the first episode a watch.  You will find the pacing to be very outstanding as each episode fully builds on each other.  A warning to you though is you're likely to be in times you can't stop, and need to binge towards the next immediately.  It was so good, it compelled me to sumbit this review, making it my first show to write about.

Note on Seasons:
- 1: Intro (Amazing)
- 2: Middle (Very good, just different pacing from 1)
- 3: Conclusion (Fast pacing, well executed last episode)",1469491200,,1047,4.468421052631579

5250219,2,B0092QH902,"I usually enjoy Sorkin material, a lot. This show, like the Jobs movie, shows me that incredible dialogue is wasted when I can't be convinced to care about the folks saying the words. Some of the acting is very good, and some of the preaching lines up with my own beliefs, but many of the positions staked out have not aged well. I binge-watched the first 8 episodes, cheated by looking forward with Wikipedia, and decided I could not justify using my time any longer. If you want to believe that a committed liberal will convince the public to vote their best interest, rent ""The American President "". If you want to see smart people try to solve serious problems, watch the first four seasons of ""The West Wing"" if you want to see beautiful people saying clever things you and I would never think of on the spot, watch ""The Social Network"" or ""A Few Good Men"" or any five minutes of ""Sports Night"".

But having said that, you must know that you enjoy Sorkin's work and with this series, he has assembled a daring cast willing to fight hard making a show that you will enjoy.  We get a chance to revisit recent history and get a perspective on how news stories are developed and provided to us.  Sorkin's white knight and autuer are here, along with the expected wise old man.  Sorkin knows what works and this show is one of his more comfortable endeavors, so sit back and soak in another round of guilty pleasure from The Newsroom.",1469318400,,650,4.391666666666667

I believe there are many people who find the f word offensive.

It's going to take me a while  to follow all the story lines and characters.
The characters express strong liberal feelings. While most of the 'facts' are legitimate they only express one side.
It is anti gun and looks to government for most solutions.
If you don't have or can't tolerate hearing/seeing that point of view, this is not the series for you.
Strong language with lots of 'F' bombs and even the female derogatory 'C' word that I haven't heard for years.
I will watch a couple more episodes and hope it grows on me.",1468713600,,605,4.541284403669724

Very entertaining and it gives us non-journalists an inside peak of the chaos that goes inside a news room while trying to cover the current events in the US and around the world.

The way it shows how we, the people are manipulated and all the back room deals that go on at our expense is something each citizen should know. Jeff Daniels is perfect in his role as are the others. This is real life in a tv show............pay attention. The 1st episode had me when he responded to the Northwestern student. 100% on target. The show illustrates that we can be better people if we care enough. The Greater Fool",1468627200,,606,4.371681415929204

Then we were shocked at how much the tenor of the show changed with the first real episode.

Glad we gave it one more try because by the 3rd program they were back on track.  Thank goodness.  Once again it is more entertaining than painful.",1468627200,,511,4.549450549450549

The premise of a news team asking questions that go beyond the usual softballs that allow politicians and others in the news to spout platitudes and avoid the real issues is inspiring. I find the personal interactions a bit stilted, but so often I raise a ""YES!"" fist in the air after an interview or conversation. It's like a serious Jon Stewart or the best closing arguments of ""Boston Legal"". How I wish some news organization had the gonads (and, ok, sponsors) to do what they ought to be doing. Jeff Daniels is the perfect person for the part. Every episode leaves me thinking,""I love this show!"", and wanting more. Bravo!",1468540800,,652,4.581196581196581

I was riveted from beginning to end. Oh,  and speaking of ending TV shows, this stars in that category as well.

It puts its fingers into the wounds - and I just loooooved the quote in the beginning that talked about earlier times 'when people still aspired to intelligence rather than to belittle it'. Yet, the downside of this is that the show sometimes definitely stretches the limit of a kind of elitist, know-it better, liberal righteousness that so much of the country is also fed up with. The show also sometimes comes off as artificial, too much smart talk, too scripted. But one must admit intelligently scripted. Just not real. And even in New York there must be a limit to how much 'frank' talk - or sh.. - people are willing to take. How often they allow their co-workers or bosses to slap them right in their faces.

A little too much soap opera with the characters' love lives (some OK, and makes the series more interesting), but the coverage of many important news stories from 2011-2014 is very good.  You have to like this genre and not be annoyed with Aaron Sorkin dialogue - rapid and preachy, but if you get past these things, it is really good.",1468540800,,560,4.0636363636363635

5250659,1,B0092QH902,"The dialogue was SO unnatural, fast and loud that I found it very unenjoyable. The banter back and forth with EVERYONE having a smarmy immediate response was totally unrealistic. I've never been in a newsroom or witnessed real newsroom production but I would lay any money on it not being anything like it portrayed in this production.",1468540800,,335,4.894736842105263

5250675,1,B0092QH902,"I work in a TV newsroom. This is laughable as well as unwatchable. Went through the first two or three episodes and I couldn't go on. Mr. Sorkin, please consult people in the industry before going on a venture like this.",1468540800,2,220,4.390243902439025

5250677,5,B0092QH902,"Yet another Aaron Sorkin brilliant success. This series is a great follow up on The West Wing. But where that earlier excellent series deals with issues as represented by fictional events, the Newsroom presents actual events within a fictional context.

5250683,5,B0092QH902,"So good at combining. Im not good with my words, but they are. Comedy, love stories, new format..newsroom, not a hospital or courtroom. So,so interesting watching during this election cycle. Much of what they said could happen....is happening.",1468540800,,243,5.421052631578948
5250684,5,B0092QH902,"This series is so thoughtfully written and even though the episodes are now a few years old, the topics of fair and respectful journalism, the dumbing down in our culture, and the dredge of politics are so relevant with events now unfolding (in 2016).  I'm savoring each episode and will be sad when it's over.",1468540800,,310,4.636363636363637

8534806,2,B0092QH902,"A sharp and witty show that quickly, after the first episode, devolves into a liberal diatribe of progressive psycho-pathology with a vengeance. The so-called Republican was neither a Republican or even a RINO. Will McAvoy is an outright far-left leaning progressive, as was the rest of the management and staff. They cleverly, and, even blatantly set up straw-man figures, scenarios, and arguments so they could brutally and viciously tear them down with smug satisfaction and make most conservatives, except the most liberal-leaning, look like ignorant Cro-Magnons unworthy of opinions and voting rights. The management and staff were always bickering, arguing violently, and fighting amongst themselves, apologizing, and then doing it all over again... the exact definition of mental illness.

Yes, this is a liberal progressive utopian propaganda entertainment platform which they will long revel in.",1527984000,,904,5.696296296296296

8534808,5,B0092QH902,"Aaron Sorkin is one of the best writers to ever work in television. He is amazing. I absolutely loved The West Wing--intelligent, thought-provoking, and inspiring, with a surprising sense or humor. I can say the same thing about The Newsroom, which I put on the same level as The West Wing. The writing is terrific. Jeff Daniels and the rest of the cast are superb. My only criticism is that Sorkin chose to end it after only three seasons. I wish we had The Newsroom on the air now.",1527897600,,483,4.438202247191011
8534809,4,B0092QH902,"As a 35-plus year journalist I love the way they approach news and information and the public's right know on this show.  It's Sorkin so of course it is intelligent, witty and it never talks down to its viewers.  It is an idealized version of what we want and really should get from broadcast journalism every day and night. I love the characters and the cast for the most part.  Daniels, Sam Waterston and Jane Fonda are brilliant. Olivia Munn (Sloan) and Thomas Sadoski (Don) are my favorites and are great at balancing humor and drama and have wonderful screen chemistry. Most of the supporting cast is fine  Neal is the most interesting of that crew.  However, I do find Mackenzie very irritating, mostly on the personal side of her life, but just as a character.  She tries too hard to be cute all of the time, and uses that even on her professional level. It is hard for me to believe she was embedded with real troops seeing real action.  Jim, her protege, is self-righteous at times.  I never was able to believe Maggie in her role. She never came across as a professional. She seemed more an earnest ""I'll try real hard"" college student journalist.  But yes when I need a reminder of what we should get and what I hope to see every morning/night on my TV I turn to this show.",1527292800,,1284,4.4297872340425535
