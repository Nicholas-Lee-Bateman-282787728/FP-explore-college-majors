8474955,2,B005IR30MK,"this is a low, low budget mexican mafia movie. the narrative is a bit confusing because it is told in flashbacks at times but there is nothing in the direction to inform the audience that a given scene is a flashback.
on the plus side there actually is some nice (intelligent or witty) dialogue.
and most importantly, Paulina Gaitan (sometimes spelled ""Gaytan"") is in the film. I have loved her ever since Sin Nombre [which is a stunningly good thriller]. but in that movie she is almost a child. in this movie she is very much a woman, and a gorgeous one. she is wearing a tiny green dress for most of her scenes and my god it is a sight to behold. (she doesn't appear until about one hour eight minutes into the movie, though.

summary: low low budget mexican flick with occasional wit and paulina gaitan in a tiny green dress.",1392422400,,829,4.4183006535947715
8474956,5,B005IR30MK,"I bought this because Gerardo Taracena stars in it and I'm a great fan ever since I saw him in Mel Gibson's 'Apocolypto' where he plays Middle Eye, one of the villains. He was also in 'El Violin'.
 As this is a latin american dvd I was worried it might not play on my computer and I would have to re-set the region for it but it went in and played fine straight away. Gerardo is very good-looking, has great charisma and is an excellent actor and all these things come out to great effect in the film. It's a Mexican film designed for the Mexican public so don't expect technical brilliance or high production values. Frankly, I would watch anything with this particular actor in! The plot is confusing at first as the action starts near the end of the main sequence of events. Things 'start' at around the middle of the film then everything double-backs up to the beginning. There's a subtle comic element which builds in the latter half of the film. You get this a lot in Mexican films. The only thing I found a bit ludicrous was that we are expected to believe that 'Roxy',the female character who features at the start of the film, is El Bukanas' mother. She is represented as being a 'mature' woman but she looks around the same age as El Bukanas, possibly younger, and she dresses like a teenager. She must have still been a child herself when she had him! However, it was easy for me to suspend disbelief and just marvel at Gerardo. He has acted in a wide variety of roles and is always mesmerising. The film is subtitled and is a good resource if, like me, you are learning Spanish.",1325635200,,1590,4.389830508474576
