Upstage, where Thao is singing, you can barely make out her face in the darkness, but the guys in the back look swell, so that sucks because Thao is truly great live, and this is the best you'll get so you'd better grab it.  The cover art looks much better than what is captured here.  Eh, so it goes.  If you're a big fan, buy this DVD and hope for something more ""professional"" in the future.

Thao moves better when she has more room on stage, too.",1464825600,,508,4.142857142857143
8436099,5,B004MMEDWI,"This chick can sing and kind of reminds me of Bob Dylan, in that she and her band play a unique and original way. They get down too and I think the mainstream public is missing out on a great talented band. This is a concert in a church (no religious songs) but there is another dvd floating around that I am looking for that has a better concert atmosphere. This DVD is a great introduction and when you see them al  put their instruments down one by one and meet at the drums and play (all except the keyboard man) and they jam all together with the drummer and then return to their instruments without missing a beat. Its great and I love their last song. Check it out for yourself.",1409356800,,685,4.1893939393939394
8436100,5,B004MMEDWI,"She is one fantastic lady, she is beautiful and it is great watching her sing and play the guitar.  Her music is a lot of fun to listen to and this DVD is a great addition to any music collection.  I wish she had more DVDs to sell us.",1373328000,,234,3.7551020408163267
8436101,5,B004MMEDWI,"For those of you who have never experienced the intensity of a Thao With The Get Down Stay Down concert, this is the next best thing to being there. No ""I recorded it on my cel phone"" job, the video and sound quality are superb and at least three different camera angles are employed. While Thao does travel around the country and the world bringing her music to the people in clubs and different venues, not everyone has had the chance to see her live, having to settle instead for substandard Youtube videos. Baeblemusic has done an excellent job in helping the first time viewer, or dye in the wool fan experience Thao ""Shake the frame of their house"". Thanks, Baeble music. Thanks, Thao.",1331424000,5,691,4.580645161290323
