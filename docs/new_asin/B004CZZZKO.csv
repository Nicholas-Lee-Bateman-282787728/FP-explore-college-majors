Silent movie star Lillian Gish made her talking picture debut in this movie as the princess dethroned to a foreign crown prince. But she falls in love with her brothers down-to-earth tutor. As expected not all goes well for Gish but in the end love prevails. Lillian Gish does her best to kindle life into a lifeless screenplay by Melville Baker. Both men in her life, Rod La Rocque as Prince Albert and Conrad Nagel as the tutor do their best in expressing their love for her. Marie Dressler plays a supporting role. Except for Gish who looks absolutely beautiful, this film does not generate much interest. I am a fan of Lillian Gish and I love her performance in this romantic comedy.",1453852800,,868,4.6

8424495,3,B004CZZZKO,"Well, this film had the potential to be cute, but I think it suffered from miscasting. Lillian Gish in the title role of the princess doesn't match, in my opinion. This was her first ""Talkie"" role. I just don't think she works as the young princess attracting the attention of two young men. I've heard others say they don't think it was a good role for Gish either. Because she is the main character, it's hard for the rest of the film to work because it revolves around her. Marie Dressler plays her mother. Dressler is a great actress (comedy or drama), but this role doesn't give her much to work with. She does do well with the lines and scenes she has though. Conrad Nagel (if you've read my reviews you know I adore him) is the young man who has been worshipping her from afar. I think he does very well in his role. He is dashing and is very sincere with his part. To me, he and Gish don't match together, though. Rod La Rocque (he reminds me of Vincent Price) is the prince that Dressler wants Gish to marry and (SPOILER: who she does end up running off with, leaving Nagel going on his way alone.)

Even though this is an early sound film, the sound is good and so is the film quality. No subtitles or special features.

This movie had a lot of potential to be a good one, and has some cute parts and funny lines, but as I mentioned the miscasting turns it into a forgettable film.",1376956800,4,1391,4.245283018867925
