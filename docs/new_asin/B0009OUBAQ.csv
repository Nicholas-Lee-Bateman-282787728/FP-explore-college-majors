2307310,5,B0009OUBAQ,"A Touch of Frost is by far the best of the British Mystery series. We have all sets and they are on their 3rd viewing. Action, humor, and wonderfully cast, these are highly recommended.",1239667200,3,185,4.470588235294118
2307311,5,B0009OUBAQ,"I am from Scotland and with out doubt this is one of the best detective series anywhere. I have followed David Jason's career and he is one of the best UK actors. Addictive stuff to watch, well written and acted.",1219708800,4,212,4.325
2307312,5,B0009OUBAQ,We have enjoyed this entire series and highly recommend it.  Great humor and wonderful writing.  David Jason is a wonderful actor.  One of those series you don't want to end.,1185062400,2,174,4.733333333333333
2307313,5,B0009OUBAQ,"We all enjoy the frost series, but we have to use the english sub titles

 to be able to understand the london slang.

Even so, we have the entire Frost series.",1180396800,,160,4.096774193548387
2307314,5,B0009OUBAQ,"this is a great series and really enjoy the story's and the antics that frost gets into,with his supervisor",1180310400,,107,4.684210526315789
2307315,5,B0009OUBAQ,"I just love Frost, not only is the show entertaining it's funny with Frosts antics along with the suspence & mystery of crimes as well.

Im hoping to eventually purchase the whole series.",1172188800,,187,4.666666666666667
2307316,5,B0009OUBAQ,"Frost is a British policeman in a mid-sized industrial city

(Denton).He is smart,brave,messy,lucky,emphatic with victims,

and dislikes authority (He calls his immediate boss ""horn

rimmed Harry"").The acting,photography,music,and story lines

are excellent as usual. Small comic moments appear-often related

to food. This item-like the previous one in the series-is well-

priced. As usual,Frost gets a new partner each time,and in this

series,Shirley Fisher reappears (the closest Frost comes to

having a girlfriend).They both seem to recognize that work

comes first,thus maybe allowing a longer term relationship

to develop. As usual,there are several (3?) story lines,and it

takes a bit to identify all the characters. A re-watch is helpful

here-something which I enjoy doing. Enjoy!",1128297600,22,794,5.929203539823009
2307317,5,B0009OUBAQ,"The Frost series is wonderful and my husband and I hated to see it end, but after 15 seasons it was time. This series is great for the British mystery fan.",1420070400,,155,4.032258064516129
2307318,5,B0009OUBAQ,"Before there was Netflix, the only way to watch a good mystery series was on DVD.  A Touch of Frost is funny and sad.  The characters really come alive due to the fine British actors.  Would purchase as a gift for someone who doesn't subscribe to a streaming video service.",1418342400,,273,4.42

2307322,5,B0009OUBAQ,The characters here are very real and the scenery is very real which makes this mystery. Its earned it rating of number one mystery in Britain.,1375228800,,143,4.538461538461538
2307323,5,B0009OUBAQ,"If you love British Murder Mysteries then
a Touch of Frost is for you.  Every story
has a twist of fate not even a hint of from
the beginning--so very entertaining",1369612800,,163,4.258064516129032
2307324,5,B0009OUBAQ,I love all the Frost series - the stories are all unique and interesting.  The subtitles are a great help because the English words and accent are hard to understand.,1363737600,,166,4.533333333333333
2307325,5,B0009OUBAQ,I really enjoyed the whole series so far.  I found series 7 & 8 the best so far.  Thank you.,1362268800,,92,3.55
2307326,1,B0009OUBAQ,"Be careful in selecting this Series 7 & 8...it is a repeat of earlier series and Amazon does not give you the individual episodes so you cannot ckeck against earlier series you may have....it's a ""rip off""",1343001600,,205,4.5675675675675675
2307327,5,B0009OUBAQ,"There is something about the English TV Mysteries that always pleases- be it the acting, the cinematography or the scripts- they are never predicable",1319414400,,149,5.25
2307328,5,B0009OUBAQ,"BBC detective mysteries are very interesting to watch because of the plots and the character actors. Actors are not chosen because of the actor's good looks. A Touch of Frost is one of the best. Frost is considered an expert in solving crimes, but like all humans he is flawed. He tends to want to do things his own way. He has little or no respect for his superior officers. He is like a bull dog that snatches hold of a person and doesn't let go. He is persistent in this way with his cases. Series 7 and 8 contain two parts each, meaning that each has a three hour mystery. In series 7, for example, there are three plots. First, someone is killing animals and shooting at articles and apparently is responsible for one or more deaths. Second, a police detective is shot. He was part of a special unit trying to capture car thieves. Frost wants to handle the case and has a run-in with the head of the unit. It soon seems that either one of the car thieves, another officer of the unit, or the dead man's wife killed him. The third plot focuses on Frost's personal life. He and his girl friend try to establish a relationship again. The problem is that Frost repeatedly promises that he will meet her at a certain time, but doesn't show up because he discovers something he must do about his case.",1312502400,,1300,4.3539094650205765
2307329,5,B0009OUBAQ,"As always...one of the...if not...the best detective series ever...
sorry that these have come to an end. Can we look forward to MORE???",1302220800,,136,4.956521739130435
2307330,5,B0009OUBAQ,This is the first time I've ever seen David Frost - I'm certainly a fan now,1280707200,,75,3.75
2307331,5,B0009OUBAQ,When I first purchased earlier series of Frost - I was not to sold on this show.  But the longer I watched the more I liked him/series.  I am now hooked on it.  I will be ordering the next DVD of the show.,1275350400,,205,3.7209302325581395
2307332,5,B0009OUBAQ,"Detective Frost is the best. He is a real cop, with a genuine love for what he does and the people he helps, and he does it without the aid of guns or weapons. He uses reasoning and sharp intuition to solve his crimes. Every one of his episodes are exciting and fun to watch. Frost is money well-spent!!",1274313600,,303,4.1525423728813555

2307334,5,B0009OUBAQ,"Arrived in perfect, factory-wrapped condition in shorter time than I expected -- only about 1 week.
The ""Touch of Frost"" series, itself, is excellent; wonderfully cast, written and performed.  David Jason is an old hand -- many film credits, and just a marvelous actor.  His outrage at injustice, at injury to or murder of children; his bravery, his sense of humor (wry winks, eye-rolls, and subtle sarcasm, often lost on the other characters, especially Mullett) and much more that he has put into the character of Jack Frost makes this series a superlative winner.  Be aware, though, that Bristish ""series"" TV isn't like it is here in the U.S.; often a ""season"" is only a 2-parter, as is the case with 7&8, but very well worth watching. There are many good reasons why ""A Touch of Frost"" is one of the U.K.'s best-loved and most successful series, and Jack's legion of fans attest to that -- count me in!",1270425600,8,906,4.685534591194968
2307335,5,B0009OUBAQ,"A touch of Frost is a touch of British Mystery Wit.
I love his low-key approach, yet he gets to the bottom of it all at the end.",1255824000,,128,3.607142857142857
