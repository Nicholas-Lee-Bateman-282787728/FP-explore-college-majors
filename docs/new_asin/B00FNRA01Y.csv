8617290,3,B00FNRA01Y,"Tory Bell (Francia Raisa) is a teacher who lives out in Manhattan with a boyfriend named James (Will Greenberg) with a secret she's been hiding, she's a former bounty hunter, when she gets a phone call from an ex-convict she captured named Manucci (Aleks Paunovic) causing her to fly home to New Jersey meeting back up with her parents Gale (April Telek) & Hawk (Michael Hanus) & cousin Bones (Scott Patey) to capture him again.  She gets back involved in the family bounty hunting business but runs into various issues such as working with her ex-boyfriend Mike (The Miz) with their friend Liz (Chelan Simmons) letting her know that he hadn't been the same since they broke up due to unresolved issues between the two, dealing with Manucci's associates in his sister Big Donna (Sidika Larbes) & Lepold (Keith Dallas), and her boyfriend James unexpectedly arriving in the wrong place at the wrong time causing everyone to try to hide her past from her now fiance.

This was originally a made for TV movie so it runs for around 75 minutes but was a nice family movie with all the different stories being easy enough for everyone to follow with some comedic moments while also not being so heavily ""Christmas"" themed that you can watch it anytime of the year & it wouldn't feel out of place so it's a family movie that I would recommend to check out.",1447286400,,1348,4.635983263598327

8617294,5,B00FNRA01Y,"i truly enjoyed this movie. Mike "" the Miz "" Mizanin showed his comical side and his romantic side as well. He stole my heart in this movie as I did not know he was a wrestler but an actor and I know that Hollywood will have their arms open and waiting for him. Please take a break from wrestling again and get busy and make some more films. Have viewed this movie about a wonderful 20+ times? Can you tell that I am a fan? Go get 'em Mike!!!",1396569600,2,442,3.922222222222222
8617295,5,B00FNRA01Y,"Very funny movie and gave a different kind of Holiday movie.  I wouldn't call it a Christmas movie as it didn't have anything to do with Christmas other than being set in December around Christmas time, but definitely a funny holiday season movie.",1393891200,,247,4.744186046511628
