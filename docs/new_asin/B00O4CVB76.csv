6710134,5,B00O4CVB76,"Great film. Awesome & purposeful story. We all struggle in life and need encouraging sometimes and this faith based movie does just that with a story about a man's life,  dreams,  and struggles.",1415404800,,194,4.848484848484849
6710135,5,B00O4CVB76,"Great film for those who want to be encouraged to step out to reach for a goal they have set for themselves. The characters are everyday, believable people, who struggle with true-life situations...you feel their pain! Highly recommend this film!",1415318400,,246,5.175
6710136,5,B00O4CVB76,Dreams...we all have them...but many of us do not have the courage or endurance to pursue them! This film takes you down the road of one person who does. You'll feel his pain and share in the excitement generated by that pursuit! Highly recommended!,1415318400,,249,4.681818181818182
6710137,4,B00O4CVB76,"What is the purpose of my life?

This movie was made on a next to nothing budget with much in the way of blood, sweat, and tears.
The story of Victor and his family is one every person can relate to in some way, as we have all struggled with what our purpose in life is. And this movie shows us that while the path we end up on might not be the path we chose - it's always the best path for us.

Redemption of the Commons is a faith-based film, but even those who are not Christian will be able to enjoy the film and relate to the struggles of the main characters.",1415318400,3,564,3.8956521739130436
6710168,5,B00O4CVB76,"Wow! Smooth, excellent flow and a real-life genre plot. People with problems (lots of them), hard times, failures, family struggles and painful memories,
even a greasy politician (boo! hiss!) all in need of help, encouragement and redemption.  A large dose of reality with hope mixed in.
Very well produced and acted; not a low-budget or stiff feel at all.
Laughter, tears and reflection on my part all in 91 minutes.
Wrap-up could have had a bit more in the way of transitional time-passage cues,
but talent and skill of production shine through.",1420329600,3,547,4.945652173913044
6710169,4,B00O4CVB76,"This was the directors first film and was made on a relatively small budget.  There are some production flaws, the one I particularly noticed was audio issues in a few spots.  However, the story is great!  Feels like real life... I definitely related with the main character and there were moments throughout the film that hit home.  This is not a cheesy ""faith based"" film.  Down to earth.  Some good laughs and a tear or two.  The wrestling match that always occurs when our personal perspectives are challenged and the decision to allow and accept change is reached, is portrayed very well.",1419897600,,593,4.754901960784314

6710174,5,B00O4CVB76,"The theme of redemption runs throughout the movie -- you can find it in the story of virtually every character (characters with names like Victor and Hope). You can also find yourself in many of those stories. This is a rare movie that supplies hopefulness with no strings attached.
