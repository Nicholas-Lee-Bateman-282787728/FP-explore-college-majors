8108812,5,B000EEN5TK,This was hilarious!  Brooke was at her best and the rest of the cast were perfect for their roles.  My kids couldn't stop laughing and watched it over and over again until I had to hide it for a while.  Great episode!,1318982400,,217,4.119047619047619
8108813,5,B000EEN5TK,"I watched the promo episode of this and it was truly hilarious and very enjoyable, however, Amazon needs to release this on DVD. It's posted on the site with no option to purchase, however, oddly enough. Please stock up on this one, AMAZON, so we fans can purchase it. Thank you",1309910400,,278,4.470588235294118
