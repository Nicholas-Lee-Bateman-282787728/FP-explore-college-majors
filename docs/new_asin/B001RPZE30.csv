8338582,3,B001RPZE30,Don't have much to say about it. It was OK but nothing I'd rave about. A bit slow. Acting OK. Didn't see any point in the part the Realtor played.,1357171200,2,146,3.9
8338583,5,B001RPZE30,This is a marvelous film from a young independent film maker. I especially thought the work of Traci Ann Wolfe as the young woman so desolate over her loss as to contemplate suicide was especially moving. The music marvelously set the mood of the piece and the locations were very realistic. I believe this movie was made on a very small budget but it was hard to tell from the quality of the work.,1302134400,2,398,4.391891891891892
8338584,5,B001RPZE30,"Divergence is a lovely, beautifully-photographed film written, directed and performed with an unusual level of confidence.

Rather than detail the plot, which has been covered in other comments, I'd love to share some of the details that made the movie such a pleasure:

*Haunting, captivating and mature performances by all of the lead actors. Tracy Ann Wolf's ""Clare"" (who I figured out 1/2 way through the movie reminds me equally of Joely Richardson and Lost's Elizabeth Mitchel) is a tragic beauty, but you can always see the light in her eyes and potential for redemption. Jakob Hawkins' ""Tim"" could easily become a maudlin drip, but his appeal to both ""Clare"" and ""Heidi"" is entirely believable.

*Writer/Director Patrick Donnelly refreshingly avoids cliches in crafting the secondary characters. The ""Main Character's Male Best Friend"" is usually presented as a clown, jerk or manipulator. As written by Donnelley and acted by Bill Hidell, ""Dave"" is a smart, sweet, genuine guy who one wants the best for his BFF. And even more annoying cliche is ""Best Friend's Wife/Girlfriend"" who is invariably presented as a joyless shrew. Jeannine Kaspar's ""Jill"" in her few scenes proves a this type of character can be both mature and likable. The ""Other Girl"" is usually shown as sickly sweet, desperate, or slutty. Marci Adilman's ""Heidi"" has an infectious smile, charming manner, and good heart. She's not too good, or too bad for ""Tim"" - just the wrong girl at the wrong time and we have confidence her true love is right around the corner.

*Well thought out details fill the movie, from ""Clare's"" neglected bangs, to the charm of the sea-side cottages to ""Tim's"" unexpected physical transformation.

Divergence was an unexpected gem of a movie. Smart, subtle, full of heart and soul and arresting performances.",1246752000,2,1814,5.114864864864865
8338585,4,B001RPZE30,"This is supposed to be a performance film, but I found it to be stronger in the environment themed category. That being a film made up of moods set by the content of the surroundings being filmed, as I felt the performances were too weak, painfully overdone and visibly forced at times.

It tells a story of a wounded soldier temporarily staying Stateside until he gets cleared for going active again. He houses on the Jersey shoreline next to a grieving widow, all whilst he partakes in a shallow fling with the real estate agent who got him his place. There are plenty of shots containing shoreline, ocean views, birds and the local fauna. The remainder of the scenes contain average to forced portrayals of the people around our lead, who manages to be convincing as the war ravaged, PTSD-type soldier.

The DVD contains some thankfully deleted scenes and alternate ending, a making-of that decently covers the background of filming, a commentary and assorted pics/trailers. For me, Vanguard can put out some adequate indies, and this falls into a somewhat believable freshman film. I do not agree with how the story came together and what the characters tried to carry out towards the end, but I do not fault this film for that. So between a three & half star film and some semi-manageable special features (for the amount of deleted scenes there should have been a play all) I give it a depressing Sunday night rental vote.",1243123200,,1428,4.754032258064516
