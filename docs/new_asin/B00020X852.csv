2053551,5,B00020X852,"I was fortunate enough to be introduced to Ali G during his American run on HBO last year by a friend of mine and I have to say that he is one of the funniest people in the business.  He's not a stand-up comedian that somehow made the transition to his own show, he is a comedic actor, fully embracing each character he portrays and making each one funny in their own distinct way.  Honestly, the time I've spent watching his show is probably the hardest i've laughed in a long time.  Not only is Sacha perfect in each of his roles but whoever produces the show is a genius as well, placing the characters into awkward situations with hilarious consequences and somehow getting really famous people to be interviewed and then almost always embarassed by Ali.
To put it simply, this show utilizes every type of humor there is and does it very well, Sacha is extremely talented and funny and I promise you won't be disappointed if you give it a try.

Sacha Baron Cohen's three characters-Ali G the ""hip-hop journalist"", Borat the Kazakhstani traveler & Bruno, the Austrian fashion reporter-deliver an uproarious crazy satire. This outrageous show really flew under the radar the first time around in the U.S.A. Such a brilliant parody, he's fooled the best: Donald Trump, Newt Gingrich and Buzz Aldrin to name a few.

Sasha Baron Cohen is tuned into the most cutting edge ideas of our time and engages our world leaders in catastrophically funny clashes.

2053558,5,B00020X852,"After seeing the first season of Da Ali G Show on sale here at Amazon for under 5 bucks, I immediately added it to my cart. This genius show really is worthy of purchase at its regular price, but I was just lucky enough to see the sale after the DVD appeared in a completely unrelated product search last week. The DVD arrived yesterday, my older son and I watched all 6 episodes in a single night, and we laughed out loud like it was the first time we ever saw the show. Well, actually it was the first time my son saw the show, and he got his first 3 hour lesson in Socratic Irony.

The Ali G character is funny, and remember it is this series that also introduced the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat/dp/B002M4CEZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Br-uuml-no/dp/B002P7UCJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Br&uuml;no</a>&nbsp;characters to the US as well. Sacha Baron Cohen takes his characters, puts them in interview mode with unassuming real people--often famous people--that believe they are actually participating in some kind of talk show. And the result is usually hilarity. The funniest part being the reaction to each character by the people that he is duping. Cohen's Ali G character (a stereotypical hip-hop, British ghetto banger TV host), Borat (a Kazakhstani reporter naive to US culture), and Br&uuml;no (a stereotypical gay mannerismed TV host) have the same modus operandi....And that modus operandi is Socratic Irony; Cohen's characters deliberately feign ignorance in order to expose weakness in the commitment that people have to being so politically correct that they almost always seriously (attempt to) answer the ridiculous opinions and questions that Cohen's characters come up with. Hence, his victims look equally stupid.

The only victim that I ever saw that had enough intelligence to walk out of the situation without any regard to whether or not he was offending a Cohen character (Ali G) was Donald Trump.

Even if you were a fan of this show almost 10 years ago now, trust me when I say that if the last time you saw the show (like me) was when it was on HBO, you will enjoy watching these episodes again today just as if it were the first time you were seeing them.

If you've never seen this show: Check. It. Out. But don't be fooled into being offended by any of the Cohen characters. They are not real; the man behind the mask really isn't that stupid. He's trying to make YOU look stupid. And if you take Cohen's characters seriously, you will indeed look stupid. You see? Socratic Irony.

2053562,5,B00020X852,"I had a great political science professor as an undergraduate, Jim Ranchino, a student of William Appleman Williams.  Nothing angered Ranchino so much as lightly examined or passively accepted ideas.  His goal as a professor, he said, was to raise our ""B.S. quotient.""  To this end, he would try to make us challenge him.  On occasion he would do his best to make his students challenge him, to force us to refuse to accept him as an authority, even intentionally lying for the entire class period, making up increasingly outrageous ""facts"" about, say, the war in the Pacific in WW II or the beliefs of some political philosopher.  His goal was not to get us to ingest a certain body of ""facts,"" but to get us to question, to challenge, and confront.

I think Jim Ranchino would have appreciated Sascha Baron Cohen's humor.  His three alter egos - Ali G., Borat, and Brno - are among the most challenging comic characters to have appeared in the past couple of decades.  They are challenging both because Cohen uses them to challenge and satirize our almost limitless gullibility.  Ali G. is a brilliant caricature of wannabes, people who are so fake that they themselves are unaware of it.  We don't know what Ali G.'s real name is, but we know that he is a white, upper-class twit.  He talks of ""Keeping it real,"" yet he is so self-deceived that he can confront his viewers by asking, ""Haven't you ever seen a black man before?""  So on one level we laugh at Ali G. because he is a self-deceived idiot, but on another we laugh at the people who are taken in by his fraud.  And since many of the people Ali G. deceives are people that we look up to in our culture, the joke is on us as well.  Cohen's strategy is perhaps best seen in a skit where Brno interviews a man in charge of a fashion show and asks him a string of questions that directly contradict one another, such as ""Why was everything so light?"" follows by ""Why was everything so heavy?""  His final question in the interview is, ""Is consistency important to you?""

Of course, this constant puncturing of the pretensions of our culture would be merely an intellectual exercise if the series wasn't also hysterically funny.  There are times in DA ALI G. SHOW when I laugh about as hard as it is possible for me to laugh.  There are also times when I merely winch.  Cohen is almost always on the edge in his humor, which how he likes it.  Much of the time when I watch him, I'm extremely uncomfortable; the rest of the time I'm laughing my head off.  In one scene I might be dying as Ali G. asks Buzz Aldrin, ""Will man ever set foot on the sun?""  (After Aldrin assures him that we will not, ever, because it is too hot, Ali G. asks, ""What if we were to go during the winter?"")  In another I might feel uneasy compassion for some poor soul as Borat shows pornographic Polaroids of him and his sister.  Sometimes his skits show us at our worse, such as the glee with which patrons in a country western bar join Borat in singing ""Throw the Jew Down the Well.""  Are we, we wonder, really that racist beneath the surface?  Or are the people in the bar oblivious as to the meaning of the lyrics?

Cohen has a longstanding interest in prejudice and hatred of otherness.  At Cambridge University his studies were centered on the American civil rights movement in the sixties (I've wondered if his frequent visits to Mississippi on his shows are related to his academic background).  I'm not saying that everything on Cohen's shows has an elevated purpose or is high-minded, but I do believe that it is part of the mix.  Obviously he is first and foremost an entertainer more than willing to take the low road for a laugh, but it is also obvious that his questions often have other purposes.",1248048000,,3742,4.4602941176470585

Though the humor is well intentioned from a liberal English Jew, the parodist anti-Semitism, misogyny, and bigotry is unclear in its vague social messages; stereotypes drawn just for the sake of humor hold a power in manipulating the less analytic of views.

Sacha Baron Cohen takes the country by storm when he hits the American shores and starts picking on as many different groups as possible; from politicians, astronauts and religious figures to feminists, fashion designers and anti-war protesters.

The key to success is the indiscriminate use of caustic humor against all.

Very well written and very well presented, Da Ali G Show allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!

2053570,5,B00020X852,"Sacha Baron Cohen is a welcome anarchic spirit, a satirist of the Marx Brothers school, closest to being a Harpo, with vocabulary this time. An equal opportunity offender, he's not for all tastes, since he's a little too skillful at showing universal human limitations, widespread hypocrisy, even rampant meanness of spirit lurking just under the ever so polite words of his comic targets, a wide assortment of contemporary men and women.  People who believe too much in their own unfailing high-mindedness (a widespread disease) or otherwise take themselves too seriously will no doubt be turned off, therefore, by Cohen's probing humor, probably describing him with that favorite dismissive adjective du jour, ""offensive.""

But I should mention that the humor really grows on you, and requires repeat viewings to catch all the double entendre and hidden jokes.  Also, many of the jokes have to be heard two or three times, before they become as funny as they truly are.  And believe me, they are hysterical.

Ali G is just one of the three characters played by Sacha Baron Cohen.  A British humorist, from London presumably, this DVD is one funny show.  Hard to believe that a Jewish man, from England, could play a ""white Americaninized rapper"" but play he does; with the minds and imaginations of many famous and important people.  I cannot believe that he gets Boutros Boutros Kahli to rap?  Amazing.

I first heard of this DVD/show from the star's interview on the Howard Stern show, and I was instantly entranced.  I am a big fan of the ""hidden camera"" type shows (please see my other reviews) from the likes of Jamie Kennedy, and others, and assumed that this was the same type of show.  But what is amazing is that everyone on the set knows they are being filmed, and yet, they continue to sit there, and take his abuse.

Howard Stern asked him his method of obtaining interviews, and Mr. Cohen could not reveal his secret for fear of not being able to repeat the process.  However, it is clear, after viewing, Mr. Cohen is an expert ad-libber, and a very funny comedienne.  He has my vote for funniest person from England.

My second favorite character is Bruno, the sexually confused high profile personality interviewer from Austria.  He is brilliantly inept, and quite stupid.  The fact that he more often interviews secondary no-body's, and doesn't get near anyone remotely famous, makes it even funnier.  In one segment he is interviewing the owner of a fancy boutique, and he tells him, presumably when the film isn't rolling, to say that Madonna comes to his shop on a regular basis, 'cuz zat is much more interesting for 'ze viewers.'  HILARIOUS!!!

Lastly is Borat, a Kazakhstan TV reporter who seems to limit his low command of the English Language to only the most embarrassing subjects and questions, much to the chagrin of those being interviewed.  I find it hard to believe this man would even be married in his home country, but showing naked pictures of his ""wife"" to complete strangers is not past him.  Watching him run down the streets of Manhattan after taxis is funny, and stupid at the same time.  Supposedly his shows are telecast in his home country, and I suspect his ""innocent foreigner"" questions are what help to warm him up to his ""victims.""  We Americans are quite trusting.

Although Cohen's characters are idiots, Cohen himself is clearly a gifted and perceptive comedian--not to mention an occasionally courageous one, as he demonstrates when he dances along with the cheerleaders at a football game in the deep South as Bruno while spectators shout epithets at him from the sidelines.  Much of the humor comes from the disbelieving reactions of his subjects, but there are also occasional moments of brilliance when Cohen uses apparently unintelligent comments to expose pretense and self-importance.  The best of these moments are provided when Bruno interviews designers at a fashion show; his fawning admiration and obsequious questions prompts them to expose themselves as vacuous and elitist./",1117238400,3,1256,5.420512820512821

He plays three charchters: Ali G, Borat, and some other guy who's name I don't know. Ali G is a gangsta from stains, Borat is from kazakastan, and the other guy is a fasion specialist from germany. Using these diferent charachters he interviews diferent people to put togeth a hilarious show. DO NOT buy it if you are easily offended by ratial, or immiture humor.

There were a couple extra scenes that were funny but I can see why they were cut out of the show. The voice over narration is pretty bad. Sacha was okay but not very funny and the other guy was[...]. The only good part of the narration was how Sacha described how he meets, in character of course, each guest before each interview and acts like a complete idiot who has no idea what he is doing, which makes it more understandable how these fools can put up with him for so long and actually take him seriously.

Persoanlly, I wish their were more deleted scenes, there must be more stuff out there. It would have been great if they put some of his old british material on there but maybe they are planning to release all that stuff sometime.

Correspondingly, most of his best interview segments happen with older people, or people from rural areas.

The actor's particulaur genuis is his ability to keep a straight face after having asked the most totally ridiculous question, or said the most ridiculous and vulgar thing, possible.  No small acheievement.

The humor in the Borat character, a Middle-Eastern man visiting and touring America for his program (beamed back to Khazakstan television) is based on the duality between Borat's polite, civilized manner and the brutal misogyny and racism that lies within his mindset and his culture, which he pleasantly verbalizes in his broken English.

If you have not heard about Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen), here is the basic rundown.  The show is broken down into three concepts following three personas: (1) Hip-hop British interviewer Ali G., (2) Kazikstani reporter apparently stuck in the 70's Borat, and (3) German fashion club-kid Bruno.  The general M.O. is to find unsuspecting interviewees from areas ranging from entertainment to religion to politics.  The interviews seem to go smoothly, lulling the interviewee into a false comfort.  Then, the interviews veer into absurd directions to see how far the interviewers can be taken off course before pulling the plug.  Granted, the concept does not sound all that interesting, the execution is brilliant.

The result is getting to see a range of the absurd from Edwin Meese and Boutros Boutros Gali attempt (rather unsuccessfully) to rap to a debate about religion which degenerates into an arguement about which of the panel members cloged the backstage toilet.

If you cannot tell from the foregoing description, let me emphasize this point (with all-caps no less):

THIS DVD IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!

Many people will not find this schtick funny.  It relies heavily on satire as well as somewhat juvenille humor.  If this is not your cup of tea, I can definitely understand and would not recommend it to you.

Given that, however, I found it very funny and was glad that I bought it.",1093046400,14,1634,4.7686832740213525
2053668,5,B00020X852,"I stumbled upon the Da Ali-G Show last year flipping channels and was immediately hooked.  Somehow this guy gets interviews with some of the most important people of our time.  The entertaining part about it is Ali-G's interview style.  He has 3 characters that he changes in to for his talks:

Ali-G - Gangster type loves rappers Biggie, Tupac, PDiddy.  My favorite interview was with C. Everett Coop, former Surgeon General.  At one point Coop calls him a complete moron.  I often wonder if he lets them off the hook at the end of the interview?

Borat - From Kazikstan, he often fills his victims in on his prostitute sister and grossly overweight wife.

Bruno - Homosexual German (i think), often goes to southern states in the US to interview redneck types and often comes on to them to watch how offended they get.

At times he does things that make me feel embarrased even watching the show.  He stood in front of a crowd at a baseball game as Borat and sang an improvised version of the Kazistan national anthem while everyone stood and tried to play along.  Or when he has round table discussions with a greatly diversified panel of experts in a field and he does something like accuse a very conservative type guy of not flushing his #2 back stage (and persistently goes back to asking him about it long after the guy is offended) and sometimes at the close of the discussion asks for a word that represents each person on their stand for the issue and goes on to try to make up a really horrible song using each persons word.

Ali-G has absolutely no shame.  His comedy is genius!

2053669,5,B00020X852,"I don't know if it has been mentioned before, but Sasha plays all the characters in the show, including Borat and Bruno. I hope that is obvious. If someone likes this show a lot, I HIGHLY recommend getting the other 3 DVDs from the UK. You can actually buy these from amazon.co.uk - that's where I got a couple of them. While I was in England I picked up his VHS of the first set of shows he released in England, and the only DVD he had at the time. Anyway, these are great and I always wonder how he gets away with everything he does.

The other show I highly recommend is the series Trigger Happy TV (also from the UK) - which is very, very funny. They are also in the U.S. now, but by far the funniest episodes are from the U.K.

One other note: If you get any DVDs from the U.K. they are going to be region 2 - and you will have to have a region-free DVD player in order to play them in the U.S. They are also in PAL format but the region free players convert the signal to NTSC for the U.S.

The second season is a little off somehow. The Ali G character just doesn't do it for me anymore. I still love Borat and Bruno, but it seems as if the ALi G premise has worn thin. I hope that Cohen will invent some new charactetrs if he returns to television. Still, this is a great idea and a great performer, buy this DVD.",1092787200,6,635,4.418803418803419
2053671,4,B00020X852,"Encountering Sasha Baron Cohen's alter-egos for the first time is like going into zero-gravity.  Everything feels weird and unnatural and it's not clear whether it's funny or not.  But after an episode or two, the joy of weightlessness absolutely gives rise to laughter and a wicked delight.

I came across ""Da Ali G Show"" six weeks ago on Comcast's new ""On Demand"" feature.  All six episodes from his first HBO season were available and I watched them in quick succession.  By the third episode, I was delerious.  As soon as I finished this 3-hour-long marathon, I began galvanizing my friends to come and watch them with me.  On second and third viewings, I laughed even harder.  Most of my friends were in an uproar, but one or two seemed to be offended by it and wouldn't watch it anymore.

So, when HBO began the show's second season last month, I was all primed.  Five of this year's six episodes have aired by now.  I've seen them all, more than once, and guess what?  I'm laughing less and less.  I'm grinning.  I'm waiting to explode into gales of laughter.  It just isn't happening.

So...there's some sort of short shelf life to this show.  Part of it is that Sasha will have a tougher time to snatch interviewees ""off guard"" as time goes by.  But, for me as a dedicated ""fan"", it also seems tougher for him to amuse me as much as he did when I first ""discovered"" him.

Sasha, I think, will have to create new characters to recapture in me (and the unsuspecting) his original impact.

That first ""US and A"" season, now available on DVD, is one I'll definitely buy.  I highly recommend it.

But this is the closest I've found in comedy to hard drugs--the first time is the best.  That's not true with other comics' work--Carlin's stand-up show ""You Are All Diseased"" and the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy, for example, still make me laugh out loud after dozens of viewings.
