7983813,1,B00008G98G,"A GROUP OF NEWSPAPER SALESMEN COMPETE TO SEE WHO CAN SELL THE MOST NEWSPAPERS BY THE END OF THE DAY. THE WINNERS WILL GET A CASH PRIZE. LET ME SAY THIS, I WANT MY $7.00 BACK! THIS MOVIE WAS SO BORING, I HAD TO ACTUALLY WATCH THIS MOVIE 3 TIMES JUST TO FINISH IT! I'M EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS MOVIE. AND ON TOP OF THAT, THE PEOPLE THAT APPEAR ON THE COVER ARE NOT EVEN IN THIS MOVIE! AND, THE MOVIE LOOKS AS IF IT WAS FILMED ON SOMEBODY'S CAMCORDER. FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, DO NOT RENT, BUY, OR EVEN BORROW THIS MOVIE. MOVIES LIKE THIS SHOULD BE BURIED IN THE WOODS.",1067904000,3,568,4.080357142857143
