8089873,3,B000BO0LAE,"Was excited to order this DVD but was diasappointed when it played.  It has plenty of highlights and wrecks but well over half the time you don't even know who you're watching.  I wish they would have taken a little time just to put the riders name at the bottom of screen and give the riders their dues.  Also, there is no dialogue just an annoying, cheesy rock track that plays way too long.  If you buy this video hit mute and at least listen to some decent music while you watch.  Ok DVD but there are better ones like ""Toughest Sport on Earth"" that give great action combined with some really good rider insight.",1284249600,5,617,4.3304347826086955

(especially compared to another similar DVD I ordered which is still not in, 1 mos. after ordering!).  Price of this DVD great too.",1282435200,,308,4.186440677966102
