351484,5,6301760379,"According to Warner Home Video's website, ""Stingiest Man in Town"" will be part of this collection of Rankin/Bass Christmas shows:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classic-Christmas-Favorites/dp/B001CO32G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classic Christmas Favorites</a>.  I am thrilled to know this is finally being released on DVD!

Okay, all that aside...honestly the closeups of Marley's face on the door knocker gave me nightmares as a kid.  To this day I can barely watch that short moment in the cartoon or hear the music in the background.  Other than that, I absolutely love this movie and have since childhood.  Walter Matthau made a great singing Scrooge, the animation was well executed and it's something I wish was still shown on TV.",1219622400,,782,6.072727272727272
351485,5,6301760379,"Havnig played Belle in this show twice on stage, it has always been close to my heart.  We videotaped the show off the TV back when it first aired and I can still remember singing along with all the songs - especially It Might Have Been (Belle's song).  They seem to release and re-release many of the Rankin Bass specials year after year, but this one is ignored.  If all you can get is the VHS, get it.  Share it with your kids.  It's better than Finney's Scrooge musical and has all the charm of the usual R/B specials.",1196035200,,522,4.232323232323233
351486,5,6301760379,"While this is mostly the Scrooge story that we all know so well, there are some nice ideas thrown in to make it stand out and work well in it's musical format. Because first and foremost, this is a musical. This special has more songs than any other work by Rankin/Bass, the whopping 11 songs include ""Yes, There is a Santa Claus"", ""Birthday Party of the King"", ""One Little Boy, ""Sing A Christmas Carol"", ""Merry Christmas Uncle Scrooge"", ""The Chain Song"", ""An Old Fashioned Christmas"", ""Song of the Christmas Spirit"", ""Listen to the Song of the Christmas Spirit"", ""Golden Dreams"", ""It Might Have Been"", and of course the title song ""The Stingiest Man in Town"". Janice Tore wrote the lyrics, which is unusual, Jules Bass wrote the lyrics for most of the Rankin/Bass specials. Music supervision by Maury Laws, music arranged and conducted by Bernard Hoffer.

Rankin/Bass studio made yet another hit holiday film with this television special that first aired on NBC on December 23, 1978 in a 1 hour format. Walter Matthau as Scrooge (his son Charles voiced the boy at the end), and Tom Bosley as B.A.H. Humbug the cricket, mostly a narrator. Dennis Day who stars as Fred, also did voice work in ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"". The famous voice actor Paul Frees appears as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Robert Morse as Young Scrooge.
Character design was by Paul Coker Jr (from MADA Magazine) who did design for almost every film by Rankin/Bass, both Animagic and traditional cel animation. The screenplay is by Romeo Muller, the most prolific writer at the studio. By the way, this was one of the most expensive efforts put on by the studio. While it did not reach the cost of a theatrical animated feature, the 150 person animation staff spent $1.5 million.

This is a very nice film from the holiday entertainers of Rankin/Bass Studio and I highly recommend. Their studio brought us such memorable holiday classics such as Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey, Mad Monster Party, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, Mouse on the Mayflower, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, Jack Frost, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit, Flight of Dragons, the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, 95% of the ones we see every year. Their work includes standard animation, stop-motion Animagic, and live action. UPDATE: Good news, this is now on DVD, a box set called Classic Christmas Favorites includes this classic as one 10 terrific holiday stories in the box set. The release if from Warner Brothers and 9 of the shows are Rankin/Bass, while the other is the Grinch. Great value on this set, it also has the rare ""Leprechauns Christmas Carol"". The picture and sound appear to be restored, I highly recommend!

351487,5,6301760379,"I really hope they release this one on DVD. It's the most magical and tender version of Dickens's inmortal tale, filled with songs so powerful that will recall that child within you, felling the glow of Xmas the way It's meant to. It's a family tradition to share this animated treasure for us and it just gets better every year. It is just timeless",1075075200,6,349,4.46875
351488,4,6301760379,"Way, way back at the time of live televison and only black and white pictures, ""Stingiest Man In Town"" was a Chrsitmas special with Basil Rathbone as Scrooge. It was a musical and, except for an LP recording of the score, quickly faded away. I can still remember sitting glued to the TV watching it. I have the recording and it is always out at holiday time. This was the seed from which this cartoon grew. The scenes were linked, not by Mr. Humbug, but by a quartet of Christmas carolers played by the Four Lads. It is a show that lived only in my momories as I listened to the recording.
Then those wonderful producers, Rankin and Bass took the original TV version and converted it to an animated special. While I would really like a tape of the original, this version is a great substitute. Rankin and Bass always have produced quality programs and this one is no different. It is one of the most enjoyable of the animated versions of this classic Dicken's work. The songs add a lightness to the story which can sometimes become boged down in so much social commentary that it becomes depressing instead of uplifting.
For family viewing, this is an excellent version fo ""Christmas Carol"" for younger audiences (but adults can hear some lovely music too). When the children are put to bed, the parents can then get out the wonderful Patrick Stewart or George C. Scott versions and enjoy it on another level. For another musical version, check out ""Scrooge"" with Albert Finney.",1001203200,9,1478,4.623574144486692
351489,3,6301760379,"Well, this is not the most accurate version of Dickens' ""Christmas Carol,"" and I feel Jim Henson's muppets actually did a better job. But this is a cute version, and if you have an hour between Christmas preperations, this is not a bad way to spend it. To some extent, the story takes a back seat to music. But, the music is memorable, some of the animation is done well, and Tom Bosley as the London Humbug is a witty narrator. If I were trying to teach children the story, I would sooner use ""The Muppets' Christmas Carol."" But if you already know the story, and you have an hour with nothing to do, this is a pleasant musical to watch.",975024000,,638,4.2809917355371905

7814667,5,6301760379,"I saw this on TV once with my kid brother, and for decades after it became a touchstone with us for the WORST possible animated television special.  We would quote lines from it and cringe with laughter at how bad it was.  Well, imagine my delight when I saw it was available on VHS!  I immediately bought it for my brother as a gag Christmas gift.  We watched it together, and if anything, it was WORSE than we remembered.  Hilariously awful!",1409443200,,443,4.419753086419753
7814668,5,6301760379,"I love the musical version, and the spiritual message that it has. It is the ""BEST"" Christmas Carol version around!! The only thing that would make it better is to come out as a DVD!!",1389484800,,183,4.257142857142857
7814669,5,6301760379,This is my most favorite Christmas story ever. It is basically a Christmas Carol but done with songs and cartoon characters. I looked forever for this movie and finally found here. Love it and my kids love it.,1386374400,,209,4.526315789473684
7814670,5,6301760379,"I had recorded this when it was on TV in 1977 and was both surprised and pleased to obtain the video [I had hoped to find a dvd]. I have a number of versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" and this one is tops in my book for animated.  I especially enjoy Tom Beasley as 'voice' for ""B.A.H. Humbug"" who narrates the story; and Walter Matthau as 'voice' for ""Scrooge"". A favorite part is B.A.H. Humbug's song ""Birthday Party of the King"".",1358380800,,428,4.283950617283951
7814671,4,6301760379,"I was thrilled to find and be able to buy a copy of this animated story.  It arrived quickly and the VHS tape works beautifully.  I was only disappointed a bit in the condition of the VHS carton, which was taped on one side and had some frayed edges...not quite the ""like new"" condition that had been indicated.  I would purchase from this vendor again.",1327536000,,353,4.4
7814672,5,6301760379,Grew up watching this and want a copy! My old recorded VHS is dying. I love the songs and everything Rankin/Bass. Gives me happy feelings.,1317945600,2,138,4.56
