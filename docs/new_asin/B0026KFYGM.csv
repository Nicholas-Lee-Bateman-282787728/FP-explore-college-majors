3854115,4,B0026KFYGM,"My beau once mentioned the study about how good smells are indicative of immunological compatibility when I couldn't shut up about how good he smelled early in our relationship...

It's true, my beau smells damn good.

Overall, an excellent documentary. There's a lot of good information in there, and a couple theories I hadn't actually heard.

The experiment where people paired off by attractiveness was probably fairly traumatic for the participants, though. '_'

They do get a bit soft on science at the end for the sake of romance. I understand. I hope to mate for life, afterall. I do, however, think all behavior can be explained with enough context.",1340064000,4,658,4.954545454545454

3854117,5,B0026KFYGM,"The ""Science of Sex Appeal""  answered so many questions about the ""why"" we chose the partners we do.  It's just not a decision to be with someone,  it's a ""science""  that has us couple up.  I viewed this dvd 4 times as to really understand.  This knowledge that I gained from this piece gives one patience and understanding when it comes to relationships.",1327708800,5,355,4.555555555555555
3854118,5,B0026KFYGM,"Very educational experiments how males and females react and evaluate attractiveness, sex appeal, security and much more. Although we may assume how we would act, feel and react in a certain scenario, the science and the experiments that they exercise in this documentary shows that it is much more complex than what we think it is going on. Very entertaining but yet educational. Bravo.",1326585600,27,387,5.0625
3854119,1,B0026KFYGM,"Much of this documentary is laughably obvious. Like that people tend to pair up with others whose attractiveness matches theirs. That men tend to prefer the common female body image (curves) and that women tend towards muscles. So many other obvious statements are made throughout. The best is where men 'buy cars to attract chicks'. Wow.

Then the 'scientists' weigh in. Several 'experiments' are conducted that, when considered closely, are logically flawed to the point of revealing nothing. Studies of tribal men are purported to determine why they are successful in producing offspring. The backdrop for all of this presumes that nature (or whatever) has created attractiveness so that people have the best chance of perpetuating the species. Meanwhile - these is never any serious correlation made between attractiveness and human preservation. There is a constant circle of theory, observation, theory, observation and never a real connection between them.

Watching this, I ended up wondering how many tax dollars has been wasted on this stuff and who pays guys like Prof. Kendrick their salary. What a joke.",1314576000,6,1116,5.299435028248587

1. A woman's face can become more attractive when she's ovulating.
2. Men and women both settle for less when they can't get their dream partner.
3. In Africa men with a deeper voice had more children.

3854136,5,B0026KFYGM,"No surprise to learn that our bodies are chemical factories.  We ingest useful chemicals (present in food, drink, oxygen from air) which are converted by our bodies (metabolized) to useful chemicals building cells, and causing our biological system to function.  We even have our own electrical plant in our brains which transmits electrical signals throughout our organism - our body.  Our waste disposal systems (gastro-intestinal, liver, kidneys, urinary tract) dispose of waste products.  And, very importantly, our reproductive system is programed to make us want (even need) to reproduce our species.  It is a biological necessity to do so.  This book very effectively tells the biochemistry which makes us (as well as others within our animal kingdom) want to/need to reproduce.  It is a very revealing analysis of the drives and desires which has caused the human species to grow and expand for the past 10,000 (+/-) years.

Only talks about certain types of people, perhaps you could call them mainstream?. For instance I am a female who (always not just when not ovulating) prefers feminine guys and is repelled by excessive testosterone. According to this video I would prefer masculine men. I know many other women with the same taste as myself. If everything is according to the desirability of a good mate for breeding (according to how they defined the traits of a good mate for breeding) why would I feel so effected by feminine men and repelled by masculine ones?

However if you leave the creator of mankind out of the picture, it makes sex appeal hopelessly dependent on outward sources such as looks, car ownership,and physical body movement.  I reject the sex appeal on evolution but more on creation.

Humans have been given many physical, chemical, and mental abilities that subconsciously/automatically do much of the work in bringing a man and a women together.

It presented the viewpoint and supporting research in a way that was both interesting and informative.  I use it in my undergrad human sexuality course to start discussion about this topic.

It is not really a drawback, but this video really changes course in the last ten minutes.  It goes all humanistic to try to make the inherent determinism of the behavior genetics approach a little more palatable for general audiences.  It moves from research to philosophy.

3854188,3,B0026KFYGM,"I did like the overall premise of this documentary. It explained a lot about human sex appeal and the science behind, why we feel the way we do. I even liked the experiment how how people settle once they know how they are perceived.

My main dislike about this documentary is the use of solely Caucasian participants in these experiments. In America, we are a completely diverse nation and as we have seen from the rise of bicultured children, there is a great amount of interaction between many different cultures. The women and guys that they used had similar looks(At least show Caucasian participants with a good variety), now I do understand experimental control, however, many experiments have to have situations that are not within normal control(Are the looks they used really normal?). The fact that they used a diverse population for the interviews and testimonials does not mean that the theory applies to everyone. Too many dating and sex books deal with a Caucasian mainstream. Many self-help dating books, assume that you are Caucasian looking for Caucasian(I asked a supposed dating guru for men does his theory apply for certain men where they are the minority in a setting? I was ignored twice before he brazenly tried to answer my question via another question by saying, ""It does not matter."")  Should there have been experiments done to show the effect of culture, race, and society? It seems the creators of this documentary knew that the experiments were completely one sided, so they tried to show diverse couples to try to passively prove a point. That is bad science. Such should be illustrated, not assumed.  There was not one golden ratio test done on an Asian, African-American, Indian, etc. Would using photos of different races and cultures disprove the golden ratio? Would someone Asian, who scores a 7 on the test have mixed reviews from women? What about an African American guy who scores high? Would his skin color affect his sex-appeal(This is why this theory has probably been debunked) I do not want to be given subliminal messages that it could by indirectly showing testimonials from different cultures, I would have liked to see the experiments done as it was with the Caucasian photos. None of the experiments seem to have used any other cultures, backgrounds, nationalities(accents are key to sexual appeal).

I understand that race and culture can be a sensitive subject for many(Understandably, it could cause issues with honesty), but does that mean that we shall not try? Are we afraid of what we might find out? The premise of this documentary was good, but the limited choice of participants was poor. Many people have tried to explain away dating and sex appeal, but assume we live in a segregated society. I would like to see a ground-breaking study or documentary that addresses the effects of race, culture, and nationality. Even 30 years ago, culture interaction was going on. Maybe the lack of this would provide a great research topic to propose to my college. I would love to actually delve into the true grit of the subject.",1357171200,9,3083,4.911708253358925
