It begins at Fuzzy Jones Pony Express shop. Should the Pony Express unite with the Stagecoach Line? Two men plot to get the lands that would go to the Stagecoach Line. Will the stagecoach arrive on time? Four riders plan an attack, shooting at the stagecoach driver. There is a chase. A lone rider approaches. [The shooters never have to reload their six-shooters.] That rider fires a rifle to stop two of the bandits; this ends the chase. The mail arrives, a Pony Express rider takes it to the next destination. The Government wants daily delivery of the mail, not weekly. A man plots to cause trouble between the stagecoach line and the Pony Express to allow a third party to take over. A gang will run off Bill Carsons horses and put the blame on Farrell by leaving a body.

There is a dance in town for amusement and socializing. Fuzzy dances! A quartet sings. Bill is told about his horses, he steps outside. There are shots. Tom Farrell is hit, but he exonerates Bill. The next day Bill and Fuzzy race away. Will they be trapped? They find the horses then fire shots to scare the horses to go back where they came from. There is another chase for action. Bill captures one of the bad guys. Two more bad guys approach, Bill surprises them. There is another chase for action, then a fight. Bill captures Rick. Things didn't work out as the bad guys planned. Farrells men haven't been paid, they won't work. Bill negotiates with one of these men, then another. Bill will advance the money to Farrells daughter, she will draw up a chattel mortgage. The lawyer plots against them. The gang attacks a home and shoots the man in charge. Bill is held up, but captures his attacker, Steve.

Who is behind the attacks? Higgins and Stone knew about the money. Bill goes to Higgins office and confronts him; there is a fight. A man steals the stagecoach and flees. Bill chases them. The Sheriff forms a posse to ride after them. The stagecoach arrives at the gangs hideout. There is a shootout between the good guys and the bad guys. [No shortage of ammunition for the shooters. The smoke says the shots weren't faked.] The bad guys surrender. Bill drives the stagecoach to meet the schedule. It is now the Farrell and Carson company. Sally greets Bill, who predicts the railroads will grow in importance. Good luck to our new company.

This is about an average drama, the story makes it better. The use of people to misdirect guilt warns the reader. This is like using volunteers who claim to be for one candidate to attack another, but no one knows who they really represent.",1461542400,,2596,4.564377682403434
8443302,4,B004VFY88K,"I first saw this film in the Phillipines in 1976, accompanied by a young lady I had found in a Manila suburb.  We were not ""particularly""
at war with anybody at the time, although the Phillipines  had (and still has) a large island in the south populated completely by Muslims, that are to this day attempting to secede from the republic.  So she was quite knowledgeable about terrorism, even at this date.
  The plot is fairly simple.  A millionaire American businessman in Greece, played by Robert Culp, has his wife and children
kidnapped
by an (East) German terrorist group.  A ransom of five million dollars is demanded, which would almost break the wealthy father.  At the same time, the real father of the businessman's son of about 11, a small time pilot and smuggler named McCabe (James Coburn), who had separated from Mrs. Bracken (Susannah York) years before, hears of the kidnapping and ponders what to do.  After a fruitless manhunt through Athens, McCabe discovers that the kidnappers are hiding in an abandoned monastery, at the top of a thousands-of-feet tall sheer column of rock, called a meteora.  While studying the practically unreachable target from a distance, he stops and observes a bird calmly floating hundreds of feet over his head.  The next thing we see is Coburn at a small flying circus, studying...hang gliders, which in 76 had only recently been invented.
  I'll leave the rest to your imagination, although it is quite good, easily the equal of most of Chuck Norris's films.  All of the stars turn in good performances, and Lalo Schifrin's score is right up to the action.  I always think of the Phillipines when I see this,  with it's Led Zeppelin bars, and it's civilized rains.  Wherever you are these days, ma'am, I hope you're leading a safe, happy life.  You and I knew terrorism years before 9/11.  Perhaps you can tell the children that it's not the end of the world, at least not yet.  Merry Christmas, Luzon.",1419206400,,1953,4.790419161676646
