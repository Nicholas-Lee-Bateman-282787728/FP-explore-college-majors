4534522,4,B0053O8APU,"I would try out this show, its pretty good show. If you like witchy stuff you would like this. It is very similar to the 90's movie The Craft. The Vampire Diaries is definitely better =)",1324252800,,186,4.194444444444445
4534523,4,B0053O8APU,"I'm a fan of supernatural-themed dramas and my curiosity was piqued when I read about this new show titled ""The Secret Circle"", which centers around a fledgling 16-year-old witch named Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson). At the beginning of episode one, viewers watch Cassie's mom get murdered, and this sets off a chain of events - Cassie moves in with her grandmother Jane (Ashley Crow) as her father too is long dead; the town Cassie moves to is New Salem, a tightly-knit community; and before long, Cassie finds out that she is descended from a long line of witches, not just practitioners of a craft, but people possessed of extraordinary powers.

As the story moves along, Cassie discovers that her coming to New Salem might have been the work of an outside force but she does not really know why. She does find out that there are other teens in New Salem that are like her, descendants of witches, and who are eager to make her acquaintance and get her to join them as part of a coven, so that they can bind their circle of witches and fully come into their powers. The theory is that practicing in isolation renders them vulnerable to their enemies (later on in the story, viewers learn of the witchhunters, a group dedicated to killing witches), and that by binding themselves into a circle, they are able to protect themselves and also come into their powers.

The various characters that make up this circle make it impossible for this group of young teen witches to function effectively - there's the uber-bitch Faye Chamberlain (Phoebe Tonkin) who thinks the world revolves around her; her best friend Melissa (Jessica Parker Kennedy) who is quite promiscuous but has her sights on another boy in the circle; serious and intense Adam Conant (Thomas Dekker) who has to take on a lot of responsibilities given that his father is an alcoholic; and Diana (Shelley Dennig) who is Adam's serious girlfriend. It is Diana (who is the nicest of the circle) who convinces Cassie to join the circle and bind their powers.

Of course there are complications - Cassie and the others later learn that some of their parents died as a result of practicing witchcraft, and that they still face danger from their enemies. Not all of them possess a Book of Shadows, and only Diana and Cassie have found theirs. Later it becomes apparent that Cassie's Book of Shadows may hold much more powerful knowledge about the practice of witchcraft and that her bloodline may hold the source to some very potent, dark magic.

Along the way, romantic complications inevitably ensue - Adam and Cassie are attracted to each other; Faye is jealous of Cassie's popularity and when Faye's old flame returns to New Salem and focuses on Cassie, sparks really fly. The episodes have enough suspense and character development in them to keep viewers engaged, especially for fans of witchcraft-themed stories. The actors were a bit stiff and awkward at the beginning and the adult actors are especially annoying (Natasha Henstridge as one of the wicked adult witches is not very credible) but as the series progressed, I think they have become more comfortable in their roles, and Britt Robertson as Cassie is especially good. I look forward to Season 2 of The Secret Circle.",1321833600,5,3243,4.8168761220825855
4534524,4,B0053O8APU,"I wasn't sure how I felt about this show after watching the pilot. I had mixed feelings.  Though as I started to watch more episodes it got better. The only problem I have with this show is the characters in this show are terrible role models for teenagers. Now I'm not saying that they should be perfect people but the main characters are teenagers that like sex and drink beer. Of course the characters are still good and interesting characters but I hope that they put in less suggestive themes because this show's main audience is teens. But luckily the interesting plot and magic makes up for it. The story revolves around a girl named Cassie, a girl who finds out she is a witch and there are 5 other witches with her. Each of them must learn to use their magic and use it to fight against evil. The plot is Enjoyble and Entertaiming but this show has got some creepy stuff. Think charmed meets vampire diaries. Here are the good and bad
Pros: Interesting characters
  Entertaiming Plot
  Good special effects
  Good Romance

Cons:  Not very good things for teens to be seeing and hearing
  Creepy
  Changing plot",1321833600,10,1119,4.562814070351759
4534525,5,B0053O8APU,"At first, I wasn't expecting much from this show. The first two episodes were okay, but I got hooked after the third, when it starts picking up. It had a lot of elements I already love- mystery, romance, and of course a supernatural aspect! I also love Phoebe Tonkin (who plays Faye), and even though I'm a girl I have developed a total crush on Shelley Hennig(Diana)as well as most of the guys on the show. They're just all so dang SEXY! I want to know what will happen to these characters, and more importantly WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR PARENTS. The plot will thicken, I'm sure. What I'm most looking forward to is the improvement of the acting and plot lines in the next season. It's not a perfect show, but if enough people watch it, it will be headed in the right direction.",1321228800,8,776,4.395833333333333

4534528,1,B0053O8APU,"I'm 30, this show could not appeal to me at all.  It felt like re-watching something I've already seen a dozen times, to the point that the superficial acting, and stereotypical roles didn't interest me at all.  But if you're 16ish, there's a good chance you'll love this, so you should give it a chance.",1319241600,4,304,4.509090909090909
4534529,4,B0053O8APU,"Ok this show is great, but its seem to be getting very confused on where it will head. I love that even the villains are not truly villains, everyone is very muiltlayers except for the lead girl which personally I don't care for all that much. Adam's back story and plot line is by far the strongest of them all. Nick was a great character as well with a lot of potential. Personally would have written some one else off on the fifth episode..such as his gf that was possessed.
 I personally feel that plot could have gone longer and deeper. It was to easy to end it as it did, it left to many plot holes on why the first circle didn't just do that? Why bury the suitcase? who buried the suitcase?

 I would like to see the two single girls develop a relationship as the antagonist being gay would make sense to explain why she is so mood, and trust no one and hiding something. I like that she is not evil as they portrayed her in the first couple episodes.
 I hope this shows stays on it has so much potential with the right people writing for it. Please do not let is become corny as hell like charmed that show blew.",1318982400,2,1120,4.171296296296297
4534530,5,B0053O8APU,Such a fan of this show already. I hope it stays on for a while. If you think its a rp on the craft or vampire diaries...it really isn't. It much more well written and performed. And its nice to see the classic theme of romantic love brought back too much of tv is about sex.,1317600000,2,275,3.9285714285714284
4534531,5,B0053O8APU,"I decided to give this a try on its season premier night since it followed the vamp diaries and I'm such a huge fan of that series. I never read the books, but after reading the plot online and watching the pilot episode I feel that I may have read the first book sometime during hs. I am a big fan of science fiction fantasy type movies/shows/books so I figured hey, witches, its been done before but with CW's string of hits lately, there is a good chance it will work out. I was drawn in very quickly. Opening scene blew me away and I look forward to see where this show takes the plot. I recognized only a few of the actors, specificaly Thomas Dekker (not sure of the spelling) he plays Adam on the show and he's been in several movies (my sisters keeper, nightmare on elm street) and I think he was on that terminator show (even tho I didn't watch it) The actors in this show while I am not sure of their ages, all look the part of being in hs, which is refreshing. Love the vamp diaries, but none of those characters are high school age and it shows. I think this show has a lot of potential, and if you like subject matter that pertains to supernatural, magic, witchcraft you will be intrigued. Looking forward to this series. Definately worth the look

After I finished the first season in 2 days I find out that it was cancelled, so not cool. then I noticed that there were books about this and I realized that my older sister had bought the first few books and I read them instantly. But she didn't have all of them and I waited for months to get the books and when I did I read 2 books in a day. I am still fantasizing about it, wondering what would have happened if it wouldn't have been cancelled.
Well in other words, this series changed my life, it's full of romance, action and lots of drama. I don't know where I would be if it wasn't for this series.

4534716,5,B0053O8APU,"This empowered teen drama is a T.V. series loosely based on a book series by the same name written by L. J. Smith.

It is centered on young Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson) coming of age and her interaction mostly with gifted friends and families. The six main characters are followed as they must work together to uncover a secret or parish together. Trust and friendships are stretched and maybe broken.

Each of the only 22 episodes starts with a new problem. We have a contagious underlying plot that gets more convoluted in each episode. Each episode wraps up the immediate problem but leaves a cliffhanger for the next. In the last episode we get a promise of more to come.

You may not want to start this series of you are hoping for a wrap-up. Many have speculated on the nature of the series demise. Some suggested a re-write. Others want transferee to another network. The best suggestion is to do what they did with the series ""Firefly"" (2002-2003) and make a complete movie.

I came to this series knowing of its demise but was still intrigued in each episode and now plan to read the book series.",1397260800,,1107,4.575757575757576

This show has it all!! If you like American Horror Story season 3- The Coven, you'll like secret circle. This one doesn't have Kathy Bates, unfortunately, but it does have a stellar story line and great acting. PLUS, this show is actually very family friendly.

The show follows her and her friends on their journey to the truth, their families past, and the social lives of teenagers.

This show gets better and better with every episode, but sadly they cancelled it after only 1 season. I am a true fan of this show and I am still holding on to the hope that they will continue with future seasons. Everyone I know that has watched this show has loved it!

It had a great plot, great actors that were likeable, and it really kept you on the edge of your seat. When I first started watching the show I thought maybe it wasn't going to be for me since I was never a fan of the vampire diaries, but I was so wrong. It was done really well, and I couldn't wait until season 2! Finding out that my favorite show was cancelled when it apparently had so many fans is mind boggling. I am still watching it on the chiller channel every Tuesday night since they have back to back episodes thank God! Watching the episodes all over again brings me back to the same point. IT WAS STUPID TO CANCEL THIS ONE. Why in the world isn't another network SAVING THE CIRCLE?? Apparently trashy and mellow dramatic reality T.V. has more substance to some numbskulls out there who really need magick in their lives. What's the world coming to?",1358726400,2,951,4.288888888888889
4534767,4,B0053O8APU,"Now while I was definitely spellbound by the premiere and I still tried to watch most of the episodes, I can understand somewhat why they cancelled it, even though it had so much more potential to become a good series like the Vampire Diaries.  But honestly their first mistake was placing the show right after Vampire Diaries.  I have a feeling that if they had place on Wednesday night they might've done better and more viewers.  Their second mistake was the plotting.  While it was fantastic writing and acting for the most part, but because they were trying to best VD, they did everything too fast, and didn't leave hardly any room to develop the relationships and make them worthwhile.  Especially when it came to Adam and Cassie's.  To already almost share their first kiss in just the first episode was way too soon as they barely knew each other, at least for me it was too soon.  In VD Elena and Stefan didn't even kiss till I think the third or fourth episode.

Third was the special effects, talk about trying way too hard.  They just threw it all in your face each episode which for me got old really fast.  It's not that they were bad, it's just that it was too fast all at once and it's also partly the reason why they couldn't keep going because it was getting to expensive.  The fourth is the acting.  While I was on board for most of the cast, there were only four major actors that I had problems with.  1. John Lando 2. Chris Zylka 3. Sammi Rotibi and 4. Michael Graziadei.  John was moderately okay, but still not the greatest villain in my book and it felt like they brought him too soon and killed him off too soon too. Chris was absolutely terrible.  I couldn't stand him at all.  He has no idea how to show emotion and his character fell flat way too many times.  Sammi was definitely better than John but still not that great and Michael was about the same as Chris.  Not to mention, his storyline didn't even make sense and to me did not mesh at all with the overall theme.

All that may seem like a lot of cons, but really it's only just four.  And other than those four I was on board almost every single step of the way.  The series had so much potential, even more so than Charmed ever had, this coming from die-hard fan.  I was so excited when they announced there was finally going to be a show about witches as it is my second most favorite genre to read and write in.  And then later I was heartbroken when they gave the axe and we never saw anything ever again.  I sure hope Amazon starts selling TSC on DVD because I'm tired of watching it on Netflix.  I'd rather have my own copy.  And seriously what's with all the unavailable episode crap?  PUT THE SHOW ON DVD PLEASE!!! OH AND OF COURSE BRING IT BACK ON AIR.

4534817,5,B0053O8APU,"TSC made the mistake of another promising show a few years ago: Point Pleasant- very similar. That mistake is revealing too much too soon. Ppl wil accept occult rituals and magic as long as they like the ppl in the show and are interested in them. But here the magical plotlines were introduced even before we knew all the characters. Therefore those plotlines held no interest. The ppl have to be accepted before their magic can be accepted. It doesn't work in reverse. Magical rites have no interest unless they are already part of interesting characters.

They got so far ahead of themselves that the show practically ended itself with the last Blackwood revelations. Adults will always be tough to integrate into teen drama- but TSC was way out. the Blackwood eps felt like they were closing an 8-yr run instead of the first season. It resolved every single tension except who Cassie winds up with. The cast members are so cute that they should have had some individual eps to themselves and branched off from the ""binding the circle"" theme. So Secret Circle showed all its cards way way too early.",1353628800,,1102,4.739583333333333
4534818,1,B0053O8APU,"Senseless plot, superficial 1 dimensional characters, mediocre acting - there is nothing redeeming about this show. It centers more on teenage idiocy - drinking, partying, sex, rather than the premise of the story, and soon loses any semblance of plot that was introduced in the pilot.

Cassy - the only ""witch"" who is worth a s*** and who wants to explore and understand her powers. But every time she does anything remotely interesting, she is being dumbed down to stupid decision making and going back to mingling with the rest of the teeny boppers.

Adam - useless, boring and full of himself with his never-ending sanctimonious tripe. On the bright side, he wears more mascara than all of the girls combined.

Faye - a teen boper who cares more about alcohol and sex than anything else, and then keeps wondering why her powers are worthless.

Diana - another teen boper who spends most of the series chasing after boys and being useless, but then whines about having no life as soon as she has to do anything remotely magical and help her circle which she started in the first place. Seriously?

Jake - meh.

They barely do anything, their powers suck, Faye can't even take on Eva who has a fraction of her ""amazing"" powers. The writers are completely clueless.

The romance part is just ridiculous. At the beginning, Adam seems to develop feelings for Cassy while dating Diana, but still declares his love for Diana after they break up, then 5 minutes later is totally in love with Cassy. Jake is also totally in love with Cassy, but does nothing to win her over, and instead has sexapades with Faye and suddenly develops feelings for her at the end.

All of the adults are uninvolved in their kids lives and never question anything. All of the teens run around rampant doing whatever they want.

NOTHING ever makes sense here. And may I add, it is completely inappropriate to have teenagers casually drink this much alcohol in a show about teenagers that is catered to teen audiences.",1350259200,5,2408,4.671394799054373
4534819,1,B0053O8APU,"Senseless plot, superficial 1 dimensional characters, mediocre acting - there is nothing redeeming about this show. It seems to center more around teenage idiocy - drinking, partying, sex, than the premise of the story.

Cassy - the only character who is worth a s*** and who wants to explore and understand her powers. But every time she does something remotely interesting, her character is being dumbed down to stupid decision making and going back to mingling with the rest of the teeny boppers.

Adam - useless, boring and full of himself with his never-ending sanctimonious tripe. On the bright side, he wears more mascara than all of the girls combined.

Faye - a teen boper who cares more about alcohol and sex than anything else, and then keeps wondering why her powers are worthless.

Diana - another teen boper who spends most of the series chasing after boys and being useless, but then whines about having no life as soon as she has to do anything remotely magical and help her circle which she started in the first place. Seriously?

Jake - meh.

Melissa - boring, whiny, and clingy.

It had great music, pretty sets, good actors, and loads of potential - all of which was ruined by bad writing.

Because it was from both the same author and same production company as ""The Vampire Diaries,"" I gave it a serious college try. I forced myself to watch the first 15 episodes intently, then started watching it while doing other things, and eventually didn't care if it was on for background noise or not.

The characters are shallow, the magic is illogical, the plot drags, and the only time anything interesting happens is the cliff-hanger right before an episode ends. There was no master plan to this entire season; it was just the characters mulling around, doing emotional, illogical things in disjointed episodes.

4534909,4,B0053O8APU,"I'm a fan of supernatural-themed dramas and my curiosity was piqued when I read about this new show titled ""The Secret Circle"", which centers around a 16-year-old witch named Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson). At the beginning of episode one, viewers watch Cassie's mom get murdered, and this sets off a chain of events - Cassie moves in with her grandmother Jane (Ashley Crow) as her father too is long dead; the town Cassie moves to is New Salem, a tightly-knit community; and before long, Cassie finds out that she is descended from a long line of witches, not just practitioners of a craft, but people possessed of extraordinary powers.

As the story moves along, Cassie discovers that her coming to New Salem might have been the work of an outside force but she does not really know why. She does find out that there are other teens in New Salem that are like her, descendants of witches, and who are eager to make her acquaintance and get her to join them as part of a coven, so that they can bind their circle of witches and fully come into their powers. The theory is that practicing in isolation renders them vulnerable to their enemies (later on in the story, viewers learn of the witch hunters, a group dedicated to killing witches), and that by binding themselves into a circle, they are able to protect themselves and also come into their powers.

The various characters that make up this circle make it impossible for this group of young teen witches to function effectively - there's the uber-b**** Faye Chamberlain (Phoebe Tonkin) who thinks the world revolves around her; her best friend Melissa (Jessica Parker Kennedy) who appears like a lost soul for much of the season; serious and intense Adam Conant (Thomas Dekker) who has to take on a lot of responsibilities given that his father is an alcoholic; and Diana (Shelley Dennig) who is Adam's serious girlfriend. It is Diana (who is the nicest of the circle) who convinces Cassie to join the circle and bind their powers.

Of course there are complications - Cassie and the others later learn that some of their parents died as a result of practicing witchcraft, and that they still face danger from their enemies. Not all of them possess a Book of Shadows, and only Diana and Cassie have found theirs. Later it becomes apparent that Cassie's Book of Shadows may hold much more powerful knowledge about the practice of witchcraft and that her bloodline may hold the source to some very potent, dark magic.

Along the way, romantic complications inevitably ensue - Adam and Cassie are attracted to each other; Faye is jealous of Cassie's popularity and when Faye's old flame returns to New Salem and focuses on Cassie, sparks really fly. The episodes have enough suspense and character development in them to keep viewers engaged, especially for fans of witchcraft-themed stories. The actors were a bit stiff and awkward at the beginning and the adult actors are especially annoying (Natasha Henstridge as one of the wicked adult witches is not very credible) but as the series progressed, I think they have become more comfortable in their roles, and Britt Robertson as Cassie is especially good.

As the season has progressed, there has been some interesting developments - Faye meets a voodoo practitioner who may want to use Faye for his own ends; Cassie discovers something that may make her even more of a magnet for witch hunters and darker creatures; there's a startling revelation about Cassie's bloodline; and, many others. The series appears to be growing from strength to strength with good writing, and great character development. Unfortunately, the latest news is that the show will not have a Season Two, due to low ratings.",1341360000,,3707,4.840694006309148

Cassie (Brittany Robertson) is the non-blonde.  We have an Aussie model and a former Miss Teen USA (Faye and Diana) and the 3rd brunette (no slouch in her own right - Melissa) is dangerously cute!  FYI, these girls are able to legally drink!

The show itself is OK.  Witches and witch hunters.  Spells and potions.  Frankly, Teen Wolf on MTV, which one could argue is in the same genre is much better.  Perhaps it is me, though Cassie often comes off as whinny and annoying.

Thomas Dekker (Adam) is one lucky dude and should have been working for free!  Coming off a 2-year gig working with Summer Glau, he finds himself the male lead in a show with 4-female hotties!  Dude, buy a lottery ticket!

I watched this show in multiple episode blocks.  I thought that the season finale (AKA the series finale) was pretty good and set things up for the fall.  On May 11, 2012 it was announced that the CW cancelled the series despite it being the network's third highest performer and highest rated freshman series of the season.  Apparently, both production costs were too high and ratings tailed off in the 2nd half of the season.  ABC Family was a contender, though an already full slate and the same high production costs were a concern.

Giving myself a little bit of rope.  While I suppose that some people do actually buy Playboy Magazine for the articles......  This is how I feel about The Secret Circle.",1339891200,4,1420,4.585657370517929

Drama, relationships, scary moments and great actors. At the beginning of the show I was concerned because a lot of people thought they were trying to make it another ""Vampire Diaries"" show but with witches but that's not the truth. The Secret Circle shows darker situations and more realism when it comes to the plots. Every episode is enjoyable, the twists are refreshing and sometimes shocking and the performances are great.

I just don't understand yet, why The CW keeps making new promising shows if they are going to cancel them anyway and keep the old ones, it happened before and I'm still angry with this decission. It was the third most-watched show from The CW and still got cancelled? I would love the show to be back in another network and I'm still hoping that it will.
Or at least Warner Bros. Home Video, we want the DVD release of the complete series! It's getting released on Australia so why not on the U.S.?",1338508800,29,1055,4.611702127659575

I have to say I did enjoy this production much more then Vampire diaries as they seem to stay closer to the original story line, but they really messed up the love stories in this one. I've also been disappointed in Faye, she's not been the bad girl we love her to be in the books.  They removed all the ""bullying"" which I kinda get why they would do that but if you think of the 80's and how up front movies were about that sort of thing, and now we just hide it all. I get why the network made that call but it doesn't feel like high school in the series, they hang out at a boat house all the time so that part makes it a little more annoying.

4535023,5,B0053O8APU,"Just a quick review to applaud this T.V series and it's high quality cast. These youthful characters [the next generation of witches] come together in alliance to deal with the inevitable challenges and adventures that come their way [witch hunters, demons, adulthood].  Their alliance feels very similar to the group that supported Buffy in last decades BTVSlayer series [friendship, drama, loyalty].

Minimal spoiler alert here: Two of the young women [Cassie and Diane] turnout to be half sisters and have an element of ""dark magic"" within them [inherited from their Dad]. Diane is mature and careful, whereas Cassie puts herself out there and follows her instincts [sort of like a Marine - first to fight]. The problem is the more one uses dark magic, the more it changes you. This sister dynamic is fascinating.

The CW taketh away: Unbelievably, this show is now on waivers, contingent on fan uproar or another network choosing to pickup. I cannot understand how a show like Vampire Diaries which seems to focus entirely on clothes and hair could survive- while a show with great plot potential is canceled. CW lures you in with no guarantees of finishing.",1337990400,4,1162,5.010362694300518

This series is a cross between the popular TV
series from the 90's Charmed, 1996 movie ""The Craft"" and every other great teen movie or show about witches.

By comparison, the first episode sucked me in with The Secret Circle, into a wholly feasible world where magic is real and is not a gift, but a curse; the first episode of Charmed was not nearly as exciting--and this being said by a die-hard Charmed fan. Anyone who loves The Vampire Diaries, Supernatural, Teen Wolf, Once Upon a Time, The Twilight Saga, and other similar genre titles will LOVE this series. It is pure talent in and of itself.

The Secret Circle is about a secret circle of witches. Cassie moves to her mother's hometown of Chance Harbor to live with her grandmother after her mother dies in an ""accidental"" fire.

What follows after Cassie discovers her heritage is a spectacular suspenseful show with lots of twists and turns that will completely enthrall you.

If you're like me and into paranormal & fantasy, especially witchcraft, you will love this show. It gets better with each episode.

I don't watch it on cable because Thursday's at 9 a million other things come on so every other month or so I find myself either on here or hulu watching the episodes I have missed. There is a little bit of everything in here-sci-fi, comedy, romance, and even it's fair share of teeny bopper drama.

The books this show is based on has somewhat of a different story line. For one things the circle is made up of twelve witches instead of six.

4535259,4,B0053O8APU,"I'm a fan of supernatural-themed dramas and my curiosity was piqued when I read about this new show titled ""The Secret Circle"", which centers around a 16-year-old witch named Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson). At the beginning of episode one, viewers watch Cassie's mom get murdered, and this sets off a chain of events - Cassie moves in with her grandmother Jane (Ashley Crow) as her father too is long dead; the town Cassie moves to is New Salem, a tightly-knit community; and before long, Cassie finds out that she is descended from a long line of witches, not just practitioners of a craft, but people possessed of extraordinary powers.

As the story moves along, Cassie discovers that her coming to New Salem might have been the work of an outside force but she does not really know why. She does find out that there are other teens in New Salem that are like her, descendants of witches, and who are eager to make her acquaintance and get her to join them as part of a coven, so that they can bind their circle of witches and fully come into their powers. The theory is that practicing in isolation renders them vulnerable to their enemies (later on in the story, viewers learn of the witch hunters, a group dedicated to killing witches), and that by binding themselves into a circle, they are able to protect themselves and also come into their powers.

The various characters that make up this circle make it impossible for this group of young teen witches to function effectively - there's the uber-b**** Faye Chamberlain (Phoebe Tonkin) who thinks the world revolves around her; her best friend Melissa (Jessica Parker Kennedy) who appears like a lost soul for much of the season; serious and intense Adam Conant (Thomas Dekker) who has to take on a lot of responsibilities given that his father is an alcoholic; and Diana (Shelley Dennig) who is Adam's serious girlfriend. It is Diana (who is the nicest of the circle) who convinces Cassie to join the circle and bind their powers.

Of course there are complications - Cassie and the others later learn that some of their parents died as a result of practicing witchcraft, and that they still face danger from their enemies. Not all of them possess a Book of Shadows, and only Diana and Cassie have found theirs. Later it becomes apparent that Cassie's Book of Shadows may hold much more powerful knowledge about the practice of witchcraft and that her bloodline may hold the source to some very potent, dark magic.

Along the way, romantic complications inevitably ensue - Adam and Cassie are attracted to each other; Faye is jealous of Cassie's popularity and when Faye's old flame returns to New Salem and focuses on Cassie, sparks really fly. The episodes have enough suspense and character development in them to keep viewers engaged, especially for fans of witchcraft-themed stories. The actors were a bit stiff and awkward at the beginning and the adult actors are especially annoying (Natasha Henstridge as one of the wicked adult witches is not very credible) but as the series progressed, I think they have become more comfortable in their roles, and Britt Robertson as Cassie is especially good.

As the season has progressed, there has been some interesting developments - Faye meets a voodoo practitioner who may want to use Faye for his own ends; Cassie discovers something that may make her even more of a magnet for witch hunters and darker creatures; there's a startling revelation about Cassie's bloodline; and, many others. The series appears to be growing from strength to strength with good writing, and great character development. Unfortunately, the latest news is that the show will not have a Season Two, due to low ratings.",1329436800,2,3707,4.840694006309148
4535260,5,B0053O8APU,"Great show. Great stories. Great characters. Red hot women. Faye is God. What else you need?
Seriously, this is dramatic, fast-moving TV that actually makes its sister show Vampire Diaries seem dull, something I did not think possible. The lead characters are all well written with intricately disparate personalities and motives. And that's important, because this is a very much a character-driven show. The CW has struck gold again!",1328745600,9,435,5.318840579710145
4535261,3,B0053O8APU,"I started watching this because I really enjoy shows about paranormal, and I miss a good witch story since Charmed ended. With that being said, I love the concept of the show I just wish the characters had more chemistry. It's almost painful to watch because I feel the actors don't really click together well...there's no spark between them that's not magically induced. I wish the writers for Charmed could give them some insight to better captivate the audience.
I have seen some of the other shows some of the characters have been in and I really liked those, so I know it's not the actors I dislike.

I think they need to start focusing more on the craft of magic and less on the teen drama romance-that's just not cutting it. And the parenting....hah! It's just as well they seem to be in charge of themselves, with parenting skills like they are receiving they would all be better off as emancipated minors!

The biggest mistake was killing off one of the original circle members way too soon.

I keep watching though in hopes that it all of a sudden gets better.  But seriously, if they moved the Vampire Diaries to another time slot and I didn't have a reason to be watching the channel when it started, I wouldn't have watched it past a few shows...and I wouldn't tune in just to see it alone.

I would not pay full price for the series when it makes it to DVD, I will wait until I can pick it up from a secondhand seller cheap.",1328227200,3,1438,4.411320754716981

Like most CW shows the actors definitly look older than the characters they are playing but since I am older it does not bother me.  This show is fun and unique and it's nice to finally see more supernatural shows on TV.  When I was little I was obsessed and the only shows were Buffy and Angal and now there is a whole plethora or supernatural shows that my family and I can enjoy.  I would definitly recomend checking this show out.,1327017600,,484,4.172043010752688

I love this so much, only fellow fans will know. *Remember that it is never too late to start watching this show, just make sure to buy and watch the first ones first.

Secret Circle is like Charmed having arrived in the 21st century.  This program has everything; very intriguing plot that has already branched out in several directions, beautiful young people trying to get through their teen lives, love angles, and not loving the ones you hate but not wanting anything to happen to them. I think all the actors are excellent and love all the fresh new faces.  Please don't stop making this show!  Actually, it's the current ""buzz"" around the water cooler.

8455395,5,B0053O8APU,"I admit that I checked out this  tv series of The Secret Circle Season One because I read online that Gale Harold is featured in this series (after I saw him in another tv series). Additionally, The Secret  Circle tv series appealed to my tv watching genre preferences due to my confessed interest in the occult and with movies/tv series featuring witches.  Anyhow, The Secret Circle tv series (season one) features some good music of which Im not sure if a music soundtrack is available for the tv series (one of the songs that plays near the beginning of the Secret Circle series is Young Blood by the Naked & Famous). Anyhow, The Secret Circle follows the tale of a teenager named Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson) who reluctantly accepts that it is part of her destiny to be a witch after she meets other teenagers in her new hometown (Chance Harbor Washington) who have also lost a parent.  Adam Conant (Thomas Dekker) and Diana Meade (Shelley Hennig) work the hardest to convince her to join their secret coven.  The teenage coven also includes other members as well such as Melissa Glaser (Jessica Parker Kennedy), Jake Armstrong (Chris Zylka), and Faye Chamberlain (Phoebe Tonkin).  Charles Meade (Gale Harold) is the father of Diana Meade and is definitely not the harmless person he initially appears to be on the outside. There are more actors/actresses of course who contribute to the TV series The Secret Circle Season One (I was just intuitively going by what I logically felt would be strong details to share).",1446163200,,1522,4.812260536398467
