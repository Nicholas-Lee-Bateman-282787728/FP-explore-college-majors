4263470,4,B0045O2PG4,A very cute movie. There are so few coming out these days that we can sit and enjoy together and then let our grandchildren watch them. I enjoyed the story and the acting.,1361145600,,171,4.212121212121212
4263471,3,B0045O2PG4,"Coyote County Loser appears to be a low budget entry that holds together due to a tight family orientated script. The ""fish out of water"" premise plays better than usual because it avoids making the man the clueless ape. An LA hip guy with radio skills stumbles into rural Coyote County only to go at odds with the female ""love doctor"" of the town. His goal? To get the biggest loser in the town to go out with  HER, his ""relationships are like cars"" radio opposition.

This was a Netflix gamble for me that gave some above board interest because of the ""romantic"" tension between the two leads. The film plays like a big safe worded high school play that gets it right. The male and female stars have no name recognition to me but deserve some praise for there exposition of quickwittedness that keeps a steady hum ""gotcha"" throughout.

Finally a film that shows a professional woman that doesn't have all the emotional answers to love. And smartly, the film shows how all men are not super tool users and mechanics as well. The two butt heads with the female radio host becoming unarmed by this guys bravado yet still desiring to hold onto her core belief system.

A few more twists and turns prevent the traditional road to an ending. A subplot with two misfit radio staff young adults goes nowhere and drudges up the films hokey origins while displaying some real bad acting. One reveiwer mentioned a ""Hallmark"" film. I see that clear as day in this better than average quickie.

Ultimately though the film could stir up an argument or two if watched with your significant other which means it effectively projects humanity. The low end style of film making does detract. Some indoor shots look like the road crew was used for regular speaking lines. I saw a recognizable face in the female radio stars mom, it was the woman who played Supermans mother in the Lois and Clark tv show. Hey, there's something.  But, the amature look of the movie prevails as it becomes an almost forgetable film saved by some punchy lead roles. I can see why a romantic would appreciate it though. I have to say, in this film, I wouldn't mind getting the girl (with some modification).",1355184000,,2170,4.608808290155441
4263472,5,B0045O2PG4,Really enjoyed this DVD.  Good for the whole family.  Hits all of the emotions.  Good life lessons.  Highly recommend this movie.,1335571200,,129,5.0
4263473,5,B0045O2PG4,"On a whim, a friend and I rented this at our local rental store.  I was expecting your typical Hallmark/Lifetime movie fare, but was pleasantly surprised by this little gem.  It has a good message and it ended the way I wanted to with everyone getting what was best, even if it wasn't what they thought they wanted.

Not an action packed flick, but a good little film when you just need a little escape.",1323129600,,403,4.346666666666667
4263474,5,B0045O2PG4,"Ah, for fun, total enjoyment, great acting, great scenary, an almost very good plot, you need to see this many times.
Everyone is good to look at... some more than others.  Eveyone has some place to go and then goes there in style and a good way.

Maybe the plot is a little long in the tooth..but not the acting in the plot.  Even the second bananas here get good lines and sub-plots.  The story line has you going in one direction at different times and suddenly you think...""Rats, fooled again!""

Good world view too.

This is not a roll on the floor funny movie.  It is a movie that is romantically funny to such a degree, you wish you were brave enough to kinda....roll on the floor...a little bit.

I'm so glad I have seen and re-seen this flick.  You will be too.",1315094400,,770,4.291666666666667
4263475,4,B0045O2PG4,"I'm not afraid to admit it - I'm a guy, and I like romantic comedies.  Call me a romantic at heart, but it's always enjoyable to watch the inherent conflict (and comedy) that often accompanies falling in love.  What I DON'T like is when romantic comedies resort to insane, unrealistic scenarios to ""set-up"" the movie.  Recent examples include:  couples suddenly being forced together to raise an orphan, accidentally switching one's, ahem, you know and impregnating your best friend/crush, or even forcing your employee to ""marry"" you so you can keep your green card.  Yes, these are set-ups for often funny comedic scenes, but they are hardly relatable.

I had the pleasure of seeing ""Coyote County Loser"" at a local screening and I was really won over with it's sweet, simple premise and relatable story.  Of course the the protagonists have conflict, and sure they (SPOILER ALERT?) eventually fall in love, but the journey the two cover to get from A to B is sweet, endearing, and best of all, relatable.  Those of us that have been in love know that the very one we love the most is often also the one that can drive us the most crazy, and who doesn't relate to that?  And for the singles in the group, who among us hasn't felt like a ""loser"" in love at least one time in our lives?

Besides the sweet, relatable story, the small-town, southwestern desert setting really allows for some cute, quirky supporting characters to round out the film.  Plus the film's leads - Beau Clark, Nikki Boyer, and Frederic Doss, all do a great job in creating wonderful, believable characters.  All in all, I recommend this film for any romantic comedy lovers.  And, bonus if you have teenagers - this film can form a great foundation of conversation for what a real, authentic relationship can look like.  Hopefully it will provide a good counterpoint to some of the more unrealistic portrayals of romantic love we see in Hollywood.....",1286668800,20,1926,4.7620481927710845

The best part of the movie was the beautiful side story of the Hopps' loving marriage. Silly, sappy, mediocre acting - yes, the story is heartwarming in part and showcases good family values with no violence or sex - but so predictable. Good for tween-aged girls who are at the stage of believing in happily-ever-after, without a lot of emphasis on real life issues, or the practical aspects of life.

Loads of great one-liners add the icing to this delicious independent comedy cake. Boyer and Clark have real on-screen chemistry as they joust, and toss barbs at one another, towards love. The Roswell-like setting (""the crash site"" only add to the this comedy's humor) and the hero's dopey Saturn 2-seater convertible (instead of a Viper, Vette, or Boxster that the high-dollar radio personality would typically drive) are also great comedy.

It seemed like the story writer for this movie understood the talk radio business.  I live in Greater Cincinnati and I'm a big fan of local talk radio and nationally syndicated talk shows.  So, the story worked for me.  I know they were trying to spend little on the production of this movie so, getting the casting perfect was not the top priority in this film production but, I enjoyed it as clean wholesome entertainment.",1400630400,,601,4.740384615384615

There are so few films that are redeeming in this world of debauchery, it's nice to see a good clean film with likable characters that you'd like to know.  For that reason, I give it five stars.  The setting seemed desolate, the typical roadside restaurant with a few farmers/truck drivers in the diner.  The guy in the sports car seemed a little too obvious, but the story developed and the people became someone I would want to know.  Very touching, I hope you'll consider watching it.
