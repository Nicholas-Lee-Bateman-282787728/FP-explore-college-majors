8353849,5,B002711RIY,This was fun to watch. I had visited the town it was made in and toured the prison. This was interesting to see the prison in action many years before.,1389312000,,151,4.066666666666666
8353850,5,B002711RIY,"I was 3 years old when this prison break took place.  My grandfather was a guard at the prison and his name (McLean) is used in the movie.  He was taken hostage and taken out with a wire noose around his neck. When he escaped and finally reached home he still had the wire around his neck.  My understanding is that the movie is a fairly accurate account of the actual event.
I have always enjoyed watching it even given the lack of special effects, great acting or great cinematography.",1247616000,5,487,4.388888888888889
8353851,3,B002711RIY,"""Filmed in a documentary style , it is an account of 12 convicts who in 1948, broke out of the Colorado State Penitentury.  A compact, aggressive melodrama,well presented and filmed on actual location.""

This quote is from one of my many video guides. Most of the others I have agree with it. Although I give it 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. Its okay, but it is worth $10. tops, not $20.

I am a collector of good Film Noir and ordered this DVD after seeing it on a list of good+ examples of the genre. The first half has a narrator describe the preparations for the breakout by the inmates as well as life inside the prison. In a Naked City narrative style it trails the inmates as they try to avoid recapture in a freezing Colorado winter.

The second part is more of a hostage picture as the armed fugitives have no choice but to invade local farmhouses and threaten the locals.

The distributor of the DVD told me it was a transfer from an original 16mm print onto VHS and then transfered onto DVD from the VHS. As a result, it is rather grainy throughout. However it is not faded and the contrast between strong light and deep shadow is quite strong. For Noir's sake!",1244505600,3,1164,4.321100917431193
