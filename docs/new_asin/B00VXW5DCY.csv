8711671,5,B00VXW5DCY,So happy to finally get copies of these two movies after not getting them years ago and regretting it. The one nice thing is because its been 10 plus years of not seeing these movies now when I watched them I felt like I was experiencing for the first time again. So happy to be able to have one of my favorite stories of all time.,1480809600,,331,4.03030303030303
8711672,5,B00VXW5DCY,"I'm about to shed tears of joy. I got my copy today and the packaging is well done. Very professional. I tested it on my PS3 and it reads fine and plays fine. I did change it to display full screen in the playback options to get it to fill the screen, but other than that I had no menu glitches. The movies are both high quality and include both English voice overs as well as Japanese audio with English subs.
I passed buying these up when they 1st released ages ago as even back then they were priced steeply($30 for D&R and $40 for EoE iirc) and figured I'd get them later. Little did I know they'd not only sell out, but that Manga would never release more beyond the inital run. So until today, the last time I saw EoE was at Otakon(99 or 00 can't remember which). Thank you so much! As I said; Worth every penny!",1475712000,2,818,4.11875

8711674,3,B00VXW5DCY,"It's definitely a bootleg, since the quality isn't quite as fine as I would expect from a professional DVD, and there are occasional glitches on the menu. However, I'd rather put up with an image that isn't perfect than pay ridiculous amounts of money :P",1468368000,3,254,4.666666666666667
8711675,4,B00VXW5DCY,This product is great and of good quality .,1466640000,2,43,3.888888888888889
8711676,5,B00VXW5DCY,"While this is bootleg from FX, it's very well manufactured.  Save BIG over scalpers trying to get $100+ for both movies!",1461196800,3,120,4.714285714285714
