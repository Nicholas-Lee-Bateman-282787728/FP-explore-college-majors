7909947,5,B00000ICB1,"I have loved Blondie since I heard their breakout hit, ""Heart Of Glass"" in 1978. I since then have purchased every vinyl Lp/CD of theirs I could get. This program originally aired on VH1 in 1999. The DVD has extended musical numbers and the complete ""Maria"" music video. It mostly focuses on Debbie Harry & Chris Stein. I think they should have interviewed Gary Valentine (original bassist on first 2 albums, but left during recording of ""Plastic Letters""), Frank Infante & Nigel Harrison too, (original members until 1982).....very strange. Debbie can keep a grudge (although I do love her), when Blondie was inducted into the Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame in 2006, she wouldn't allow Valentine, Infante of Harrison to perform with them the night of their induction (Infante & Harrison sued Harry & Co when they went on a reunion tour, they wanted to rejoin the group on record & tour, but the suit was dismissed). There should have been a second Behind The music on this group!",1461974400,,975,4.741176470588235
7909948,3,B00000ICB1,"This is a great DVD for any hardcore Blondie fan. There's no extra material though in the case and no extras on the disks. Plenty of great concert segments included as well the unreleased, ""Maria."" This title gets three stars from me though because the studio was too cheap to make it closed captioned for the deaf and hard of hearing. Given that this was largely interviews with the band, it would have been nice if I could have actually followed what everyone was saying. This aired on VH1 in closed captioned, but I've no idea what they were thinking when they put the DVD together...",1039564800,2,587,4.547169811320755
7909949,5,B00000ICB1,"Deborah Harry, probably the most under-rated performer of our time, (and the best-looking 55-year-old woman around) finally gets her story told in  this extremely enjoyable Behind The Music episode. If you've already  watched and/or recorded this from VH1 and think you don't need to see the  video......think again!  There is lots of additional footage here that was  not included in the TV special, like almost the entire video of ""I Can  See Clearly"", more of the early black-and-white concert footage, the  video for ""Maria"" and lots more. An excellent treat for the  Blondite!",966124800,14,581,5.172043010752688
7909950,5,B00000ICB1,"This is a very well produced video biography of the group ""BLONDIE"".I have been a fan of ""Blondie"" for many,many years but never had the facts about how the group members got together or  Debra Harry's background until i saw this video. This video pulls no  punches,it tells about their struggles to make it as a band and then the  internal bickering that ended up pulling them apart. The love story between  Chris Stein and Debra Harry is wonderful,how she stood beside him during  some very trying times is a lesson alot of relationships could benefit  from. This is a wonderful video and i highly recommend it to any  ""Blondie"" fans out there who want to get a real good basic  background of them. I also highly recommend Blondie's reunion concert in New  York City which promotes their newest releases(which by the way are great  also!)

7909952,5,B00000ICB1,"This DVD is a must have for any Blondie fan. I just purchased this DVD and love it. The additional footage is great. Also, the movie is very good and explains the entire Blondie story. The footage of Debbie and the band are  great!",955756800,6,231,4.25
7909953,5,B00000ICB1,"I still find it hard to believe that I actually own a video as wonderful as this.  As a Blondie fan of many years I remember how difficult it was to get any information about Deborah Harry or any of the band members just a  couple of years ago.  Now with the release of No Exit and this excellent  VH1 showcase Blondiemania is Back!  The producers to a wonderful job of  weaving a very intimate portrait of Blondie's journey to stardom as well as  Deborah's evolution into a pop icon and mature performer.  My only  reservation is that it left out crucial points.  For instance there is no  mention of Deborah's 1981 solo album Koo Koo.  There are no interviews with  Nigel Harrison, Frank Infante or Gary Valentine which would have been  fascinating.  Also the video seems to suggest that Deborah's solo career  was somehow lack luster but then relies heavily on her solo videos and  photos to tell the story of Blondie.",944438400,7,921,4.552147239263804
