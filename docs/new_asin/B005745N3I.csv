8460239,5,B005745N3I,"Why isn't there a Region One dvd of this very funny and original documentary? Ferrara shows his love for an older generation of Italian Americans who in no way resemble the cretins of MTV's ""Jersey Shore."" His aging subjects represent a proud ethnic heritage that is fading just as fast as the San Gennaro Feast itself. The party's over. Ten-or-fifteen years from now, this film will serve as an amazing testament to a vanished, but much more genuine, breed of New Yorker. Grazie, Abel.",1343260800,3,486,4.7976190476190474
