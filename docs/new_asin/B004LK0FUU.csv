4401428,5,B004LK0FUU,"A hidden reality for rich professionals in developing nations.
Movie will force you to think: how you would react in these situations?
Where is the balance: Material world, fulfilling desires and think fairly for the life roadmap.
Acting and script is 5 star. Not a easy topic to make a film. Actors and Director: well done !",1443484800,,325,4.719298245614035

4401432,4,B004LK0FUU,this was actually very interesting and if they had taken out the songs and dance and not make it a musicle it would have been a 5 star.  this was a heavy subject of sugragate mother.  but in this case a rich couple is using a surigate mother b/c the rich professional women on a fast tract to sucess does not want to make time out to carry the baby. does not want to give up her career for preganncey.  here is a poor lady he diceds to do it b/c she needs the monwy so her family won't starve.  The amount she is recieveing is farly small for nine monts of work with a danger to her likfe and has 2 kids of her own to raise.  It amazes me how rich can take advantage of the poor like that.  it is worth watching.,1434412800,2,712,3.8758620689655174
4401433,3,B004LK0FUU,"The movie does have strong foundation as its reformed storyline. Though the story has been told several times earlier but its presentation could have been better. The concept of surrogate mother has been utilized in several Hindi movies as well as TV serials. The basic concept was evolved wonderfully along with the issues of urban and rural society as well as women's preferences in their life. Anup Das, director, seems to have strong message behind ""Life Express"" but he could not convey the same in impact way. He seems to have messed up his fundamental idea with the evolution of events in the movie.

Kiran Janjani and Rituparna Sengupta have given average performances in their roles though at times few career-oriented women will relate themselves to Tanvi's aspirations. Janjani remains mute spectator most of the times. Diva Dutta outshines every character of the movie while playing expecting mother. The skills of seasoned actors like Alok Nath, Anjan Srivastva and Vijayendra Ghatege have not been hunted properly. The brilliant story idea seems to have ruined in the hands of bad screenplay.",1300579200,,1106,5.144444444444445

4401436,3,B004LK0FUU,"This movie started out promising... a young couple, both husband and wife doing well. Then the wife becomes pregnant, and has to go on bed rest at the expense of her career.  Well, yes, she decides to abort, and have a surrogate carry her baby. But it confuses many important social issues.  Does having a baby preclude having a successful career for the woman? Why is there not more discussion of other possibilities, such as the man compromising a bit of his career, so that they can rear the child together.  Why is it only the woman who has to bear the brunt of raising a child? and the guilt if she chooses not to?  And really, this totally confuses the concept of surrogacy.  It shows it as more of a shady practice than one with more of a positive possibility.  More education is needed by the writer, director and producer.  They chose the predictable and uneducated way out.  Disappointing as these are important topics.",1459728000,,929,4.587878787878788
