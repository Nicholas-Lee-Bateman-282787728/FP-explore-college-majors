8301867,4,B001FBPSWI,"Without revealing too much, this story concerns an aging house-sitter, Jean, whose last job is to take up residence in an old English manor while the owners are on vacation. She has a bleak and lonely future and it is unsurprising that this very unremarkable woman wants more of what she's been deprived of in life. It begins with some delicacy, but it is evident early on that Jean decides there is no going back. There's no fear or even moments of doubt, Jean is set on playing the part she has always desired. Along the way, she meets two other people with troubled pasts and she keeps her 'game' going for as long as possible. But, like anything that's too good to be true, we know that it usually is. The storyline is quite unique but unfortunately, I was concious of how this would end from the beginning. There is really nowhere for the story to go. But, watching the actors, it is clear that their characters have not resigned themselves to their fate and that's what keeps it interesting. Well played by Penelope Wilton as Jean and Nicholas Le Prevost ('Return to Cranford', 'Jewel in the Crown')who makes a brief appearance as Rev. Brookes. Overall, this film had a lot of suspense. I just wish I didn't know what was coming.",1267833600,,1235,4.542600896860987
8301868,4,B001FBPSWI,"From the onset you can tell there are going to be some severely disturbed and dysfunctional individuals in this film. What made it interesting though was how the writers managed to bring the three main (and completely unrelated) characters into the same realm - in a fashionable way.

Beautiful countryside, an historical mansion and grounds, mixed with an opportunity for three people to live out their dream lives offers plenty of chances for things to get unbelievable. But in the end, everything appeared quite absorbing (in a weird kind of way), and the filmmakers did a great job of bringing it all together.

There is plenty of sad moments and realizations of how pathetic these character's lives have been, but the narration and foreshadowing help move things along in a good way. The DVD cover art on both sides gives away the second-to-last twist, which would have made things better not knowing. Plus I have learned what certain phrases mean on Brit DVD descriptions so I had a strong idea what the last scene would be.

Overall, a solid film but skip looking at/reading the DVD case to stay surprised, and there are no real special features to speak of so it might be a better renter than a buyer.",1227312000,3,1209,4.747619047619048
