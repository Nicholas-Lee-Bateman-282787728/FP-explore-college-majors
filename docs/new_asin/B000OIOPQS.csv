8185258,5,B000OIOPQS,"Perhaps a little dated now that we are in a digital age for filmmaking, but it was an interesting look into the kinds of people who attend NYU film school and whether it is all worth it in the end.",1410048000,,197,3.95
8185259,5,B000OIOPQS,"This is a great doc miniseries.  It even features Cary Fukunaga, who recently directed season 1 of the HBO series True Detective.  He was studying to be a cinematographer at the time and it's interesting to see him work with directors.  He was in multiple meeting with one of the directors telling him that his story wasn't working. This is in my opinion overstepping the bounds of a DP, but it's film school and Cary is the only person from this show that has made anything bigger than this doc.  There is even another scene where two director's are meeting up and they are complaining about Cary.  Who would have thought the only person to make it out of this show in a great way would be a DP that was causing problems?  Although in his defense, you can see even back then that Fukunaga was operating on a different level, and this show was shot a decade ago.",1398384000,3,862,4.389937106918239
8185260,5,B000OIOPQS,"I saw this movie via a friend, a while ago. And I loved it so much, I wanted to purchase it.
Truly, the only complaint I have, is that I wanted more. I wanted these character to still exist past the ending. Not that I wanted a sequel or anything; but I would've been okay with more long-term.. these are the types of characters and character-developments that make a great tv series. The cast is great, and completely believable/excellent in their characters; and I loved every minute. I think Max just about stole the screen, and instantly captivates you when he's on the screen, even though he's not incredibly prominent/loud in the film (he's more subtle/shy than others).. I loved it. I loved this film, its range of characters, the dynamics, and the script/writing itself. All excellent.",1308787200,,792,4.788321167883212
8185261,5,B000OIOPQS,"My Son who is taking Media/Broadcasting classes at our Community
College loved seeing this video.  He was able to get a taste of
what a Film School has to offer.",1272672000,,161,4.366666666666666
8185262,5,B000OIOPQS,"I have an interest in movie making and have wondered what NYU's film school is like.  It was great to see the different personalities, their challenges, and potential results of Film School.  I highly recommend this for anyone interested in some decent insider information (actually insightful reality tv).",1247443200,,306,5.354166666666667
8185263,3,B000OIOPQS,This doc-series details the struggles of a handfull of young filmmakers trying to finish their projects.  An interesting look at the life of a film student.  How did she think she would actually get a MONKEY!??,1229040000,,210,4.805555555555555
8185264,5,B000OIOPQS,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary of a few film school students struggling to ""make it"", while making their 'thesis'/movie.  It really helped me understand how difficult it is to direct, cast, edit, produce... never having done it myself.  The three main protagonists are fascinating and sympathetic characters.  I was thoroughly engrossed and I'm sorry to see the program end.",1218412800,,381,5.423728813559322
8185265,5,B000OIOPQS,"I've been working making a documentary and with other filmmakers for a couple of years.. Always trying to learn.. I figured it would be great to see what the students in the schools do that I could never afford.  This is a really fun masterpiece.. you don't really get anything very technical, but get to see a lot totally dysfunction people working on films..

I've lent this out to several people so far.. you know they actually liked it when they come back to you and tell you about it.. if it sucked they would never really say anything.. This people like to talk about.  Its like another doc ""Hands on the Hardbody"" except about film students..
I looked forward everyday to watching the next installment, was bummed when it was done.

Tons of fun.. you might actually learn a few things too.

I highly recommend it even if nothing more than entertainment.",1204675200,3,860,4.594771241830065
