8175235,4,B000N6UEYI,"Picking up exactly where it left off, this volume gives the audience absolutely no time to rest between stories. While a couple of the smaller side stories such as Kon attempting to run away ended up just being silly filler, the rest of this volume has great action and a great sequence of events to carry us into what has started as a very interesting new story.",1213833600,,363,4.432835820895522
8175236,5,B000N6UEYI,"Bleach is a anime/manga (cartoon/book series) about a 15 year old boy named Ishigo (meaning Strawberry). He is a normal kid, except he can see the spirits of the dead. This story focuses on his ataining the powers of a being called a Soul Reaper so that he can fight against these monstrous creatures called Hollows (the spirits of the dead who do not pass on and become soul-eating monsters). It is now showing on Adult Swim and is a very popular series. I highly suggest it for anyone looking for something new. It has comedy, drama, great action scenes, and memorable characters.",1184198400,2,582,4.660194174757281
8175237,4,B000N6UEYI,"Uryu, the last Quincy, has challenged Ichigo to a Hollow hunting contest to prove which is superior, a Hollow killing Quincy OR a Hollow purifying Soul Reaper. He has used bait to draw Hollows to the city but he doesn't reckon on HUNDREDS showing up! What's worse is that there's a Evangelion size super Hollow called Menos Grande that rips open the very sky itself. How can Ichigo and Uryu possibly battle against such power whilst battling the smaller Hollows that could harm innocent people?  The answer: Some of Ichigo's friends begin to awaken their own Hollow battling spiritual powers as they find their lives and the lives of their loved ones in danger.

It was at this point in the manga version of Bleach that I just couldn't go on any more because I just thought that all of Ichigo's friends developing supernatural powers was just a little too convenient. On top of that, some of the powers themselves were pretty dumb, especially Orihime's too cute gang of Tinkerbell battle attack screaming fairies! I kinda just gave up on the manga at that point and quit reading the series. I had the same problem with Naruto. But watching the anime versions of Bleach and Naruto have been more enjoyable. With the Bleach anime, maybe the whole setup didn't seem as goofy because I already knew what was coming. But I think it was more because of the great voice acting and masterful hand of the director that the anime is superior to the manga. Everything that made me roll my eyes while reading looked cool in motion and execution. I'm even thinking about picking up the manga again because I've been so impressed with the anime. Great series so far.",1183939200,3,1652,4.673539518900344
