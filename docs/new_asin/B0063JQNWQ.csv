4942000,5,B0063JQNWQ,The first movie with subtitles that I watch all the way through. I loved it. Plus it was the first movie I saw with my boyfriend. So it has some sentimental value too.  Worth viewing.,1355270400,,183,4.228571428571429
4942001,5,B0063JQNWQ,"Okay, I'm a person that likes to know where she's going and Fish Story took its time with different time periods and characters to get us to the end. Somehow the song ""Fish Story"" saves the world??? Fortunately, the writing and acting were really good helping me to be less impatient about how it all ties together. Then the ending was pretty awesome. I think I'll remember this movie for a long time.",1338076800,,401,4.506849315068493
4942002,5,B0063JQNWQ,"I just happened to stumble across this gem this evening and felt compelled to write about it.  This is a ""must see"" for avid movie watchers.  Why?  If you enjoy seeing complex, intricately woven stories masterfully done instead of the same old cliche Hollywood blockbusters, then this is your movie!  Movies that sit with you for a while afterwards are absolute diamonds!  It is funny to see the range of reviews for this movie because you either absolutely love it or perhaps don't get it?

It makes me want to spend time learning about the Director and all his or her movies.  I also want to explore the story that the film was based on.  A great movie engages you, makes you think about its meaning, and forces you to act in some way.  As a result I am writing this review, will look for story it was based on and purchase.  I watch the Oscars yearly and believe it should have been nominated for something that year it came out. To me it reminds me of  certain sequential elements of ""Etermal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"".  I felt uplifted after watching by its charm and spirit.  If you like movies with some depth and a powerful message, this is a must see.

I now have a new top ten list with The Fish Story towards the top if not at the top!

Go rent it, purchase it or download it!",1331942400,,1292,4.3029045643153525
4942003,5,B0063JQNWQ,"The story line is a as improbable as the summary, but somehow it all comes together at the end. The characters are engaging or at least intriguing and the movie has more to do with the magic of everyday reality rather than any supernatural nonsense, despite the impending end of the world.  Debussy once said that ""Music is the silence between the notes"" and in this movie a silent stretch in an obscure Japanese punk song allows not only music but a remarkable string of events that someone ends up saving the world from an approaching comet.  A unique film that is thoroughly enjoyable.",1329177600,5,588,4.644230769230769
4942004,2,B0063JQNWQ,"Fish Story is a great, unique film not to be missed.

However, you should avoid this particular DVD issue.
Why?
1. This dvd is NOT ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN. That is unacceptable.
2. This dvd does not contain extras (like 35min making of documentary) that other releases do.
3. The subtitles are off during the final sequence of the film. This is not absolutely crucial for enjoying this great film but the timing of what should be subtitled (no spoilers here) during this sequence hugely contributes to what the film is all about thematically.

I suggest you either:
1. What for a better Region 1 release (Blu-ray)
2. Get the Region 2 UK version (which I own) that is superior to this one
3. Stream it from Netflix (which is anamorphic and has correct subtitles)

Don't get me wrong. Even if you are stuck with this inferior dvd, you will be satisfied. The film is that good.

But as I stated above, you can do better.",1325980800,25,915,4.560975609756097
4942005,5,B0063JQNWQ,"I've been on the lookout for this film for a while now and I finally got a chance to see it.  It not only met my expectations but it exceeded them. A band in 1975 that was punk before the world knew what punk was, a timid university student, a man who was raised from birth to be ""the champion of justice,"" and a group of men waiting for the word to end are united by the song Fish Story which  eventually saves the world.  How these stories connect is fairly ingenious and the acting and story telling in each part is superb.  Most importently, it's a movie with a sense of humor that pokes fun at the japanese music industry, our unshakable belief in the Go Rangers (power rangers), and the belief that music can save the world. This is, unfortunately, one of those movies you only find if you go looking for it.  I can't imagine a lot of people have heard of it in the states. In the same year that has Melencholia and Tree of Life getting so much attention for epic world ending scenarios it would be nice to see their punk Japanese cousin get a little stateside recognition.  Then again, if everyone liked it it probably wouldn't be punk anymore.",1325894400,5,1151,4.305555555555555
4942006,5,B0063JQNWQ,I saw this movie and i thought well thats an odd title for a movie. But i don't mind subtitles if the movie is actually good. This movie blew away my expectations. It's a must watch for anyone,1322006400,3,192,4.078947368421052

4942009,5,B0063JQNWQ,I'm not usually a fan of movies with subtitles but I (and my family) love this movie and have watched it many times.  It is just an incredible story with a series of plot twists that pulls everything together at the end.,1408320000,,220,4.238095238095238
4942010,4,B0063JQNWQ,"Plot sounds completely improbable, a song that saves the world?? How the heck?

So sit back and watch.

Thoroughly enjoyable movie, well plotted, engaging characters and a few laughs as well.

Highly recommended for ages teen and above. Don't give it away early, like a good stew it needs time to bring all those seperate ingredients to a satisfying whole.",1406505600,,356,4.9
4942011,5,B0063JQNWQ,"One of the best movies I've seen. Well made, entertaining, acting and good story.",1406505600,,81,4.857142857142857
4942012,5,B0063JQNWQ,"This has become one of my favorite movies.  I had been content to watch it on Netflix whenever I needed cheering up, like after reading or watching something particularly depressing or creepy.  But since it's no longer available there, I had to get the DVD for myself.

The story is so fantastically implausible that you can't help but love it.  The music is great and the song brings a smile to my face every single time I hear it.  The elements within it seem so disparate to a person seeing it for the first time, but the way they come together is so incredibly satisfying.  I've yet to find another person who has seen this movie and not loved it.  That's saying a great deal, when there are people who can't even agree on the renowned classics, isn't it?  You won't regret seeing this.",1403395200,,790,4.4375
4942013,5,B0063JQNWQ,"This is quirky, somewhat campy that all comes together very well.  Enjoyable, visually entertaining, plot twists, humorous and delectable filming.  I have a lot of asian films and am very pleased to add this one.  Along the lines of Sharkskin Man, Peach Hip Girl it can bring tongue in cheek, humour, love and comedy all together.  And Sci-Fi!  What else could you want?  This is the Region 2 version which I read is preferable to the standard US DVD.  This film deserves a BluRay version, hopefully with even more added features.

Good shipping and packaging from Amazon seller also.",1396137600,,584,4.828282828282828
4942014,5,B0063JQNWQ,"Well edited...great stories, too!...
Everything is woven together in the last part of the movie!
Music is cool...I bought the soundtrack on Amazon.
Enjoyed the movie tremendously!",1382313600,,179,5.666666666666667
4942015,5,B0063JQNWQ,"If you're looking for an unusual movie that keeps you guessing, this is it. The premise seems preposterous: can a song save the earth from crashing comet?  In fact, the story seems so preposterous you wonder how it can end.  The characters and music are engaging as you flash forward and backward in time. You wonder how it will all tie together - but it does!  Highly recommended as unusual, interesting and a great ending.",1363132800,,424,4.626666666666667
4942016,5,B0063JQNWQ,"This a review for the movie, not the DVD it comes on.

If you like foreign films (that is, if subtitles don't bother you) and you like weird comedies, this is the movie for you! The story telling reminds me of Pulp Fiction (a bunch of seemingly unrelated things get tied together). It's.... well.. it's good. I can't explain why, or how, or even the story line beyond what's advertised, but it really is good.

The translating for the subtitles seems really good too. Easy to read, flows well, etc. A good translation, especially for a movie like this, is really important. Props to the translator and editor! :)",1356480000,,612,4.605504587155964

I adore this movie and will show it to anyone who doesn't mind subtitles. It is a silly, funny movie about the world and your place in it. Totally worth a watch.",1503532800,,332,3.8970588235294117
8492112,5,B0063JQNWQ,"The premise is strange, but the movie is excellent.  Watched it with a friend and at the end we went back and forth on all the details that we didn't understand at first.  Minds blown by all the details that came together.",1494633600,,222,4.261904761904762

8492115,5,B0063JQNWQ,"Love it. I've been waiting for one with subtitles so I could actually know what they are saying for awhile now. It's different so anyone else may or may not like it.
Now for those who read for summerys.
It a tale about how several different people can affect the future. The world is about to be destroyed pretty much everyone has given up and then we get to jump around to see snipe bits of several different peoples lives and at the end we see how they all come together or affect the others that lead to saving the world.
That's all I'm going to say because if I go any deep I might just tell the whole story rather than sumerize it.",1439942400,,636,4.137096774193548
8492116,4,B0063JQNWQ,"Fish Story is quite literally one of the best films I have ever seen. It is packed full of hope, love, action, heart and fantastic music. It's a story about the events of your life, no matter how small, no matter how seemingly insignificant can change the events of the world. Like ripples in a pond, the actions of one unknown, pioneering punk band from 1970s Japan go on to save the entire world. I don't know anyone who has seen this movie and didn't come away feeling amazing, many of whom want to watch it again right away.

So why not 5 stars? This is a terrible presentation for this film... this movie deserves better. Released only 6 years ago, this is currently the only way to watch this film legally in the United States. It was available on Netflix for a short film in HD, but there has never been a blu-ray release of the film even in Japan.

This is a 4:3 format video with black bars. That means it's not even in anamorphic widescreen which has been a DVD standard for most movies for the past 10 years. If you have a modern television and try to watch this film you'll find that you have to zoom to get the picture framed correctly. You'll encounter a lot of artifacting, distortion and a generally blurry picture which is a shame since this movie looks so fantastic when presented well.

I got to see this movie in theaters at Fantastic Fest in 2009 and it changed the way I view cinema. I don't know if I'll find a movie quite as perfect ever again. Japanese cinema has a long history of getting poor quality releases in the US and this is one of the worst examples.

Basically if you want to watch this movie, it's your only option. BUT it's not a great one. Hopefully we'll get a proper blu-ray release in the future or it'll pop up on iTunes.",1439337600,3,1764,4.304216867469879
8492117,5,B0063JQNWQ,"Fantastic movie!
The interplay of the song in people's lives over the years is just done so originally, I am surprised that there hasn't been an American studio remake of this yet.
Too bad it is not on Blu-ray, Prime Video, or Netflix (used to be),
Worth the buy...",1438041600,,265,4.428571428571429
