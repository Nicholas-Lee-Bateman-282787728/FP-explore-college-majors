There are 4 movies, I only watch the first 2 and decided to quit. The director took the film and added parts,change characters and story as well. I know that most adaptations are not 100% loyal to the book but this one literally raped the book. The book is perfect, that's why it's a classic there's no reason to change EVERYTHING of the story. To sum it all up, it's a piece of crap and don't buy it.",1301443200,5,531,4.165048543689321
