3616805,5,B001GMX9Q8,"Watching this DVD to relax after long days in the office -- and traffic! -- does more for my peace of mind than anything.  Beautiful tropical ""trex"" segments, soothing rainforest sounds.  Highly recommend!",1231718400,,205,5.181818181818182
3616806,5,B001GMX9Q8,This is so great because I look forward to getting out of bed to work out in the morning so that I can watch this video before I start my hectic work day.  It puts me in the right frame of mind for the rest of the day!  I love it!,1224201600,7,230,3.4901960784313726

3616809,5,B001GMX9Q8,"I love the scenic Trex dvd.  The walk is smooth, the landscape is breathtaking and the five minute waterfall at the end of the dvd will take you away...I think the waterfall is one this one, I have two of Scenic Trex dvd and love both of them. I will be buying more. Perfect for  treadmill, elliptical, or stationary bike. This series is absolutely the best.",1419724800,3,358,4.409090909090909

3616812,1,B001GMX9Q8,"I was not really ""moved"" by this DVD...I'd rather watch the news.  I'm sorry, but I found the DVDs to be boring.",1399334400,,112,4.090909090909091
3616813,5,B001GMX9Q8,I don't know who thought of this idea...but I love it. It makes working out go soo much faster! The scenery is awesome!,1391040000,,119,4.217391304347826
3616814,2,B001GMX9Q8,"All of the Scenic Trex video are murky, low qualityand not at all comparable
to the one I have gotten from Virtual Walks. Be assured that I will not buy any others!!!",1377043200,2,166,4.21875
3616815,3,B001GMX9Q8,"I bought this in an attempt to bring the virtual reality experience to my use if my elliptical trainer. I set up my TV infront of it on the cheap - 16 inch screen. I have Sennheiser wireless headphones but I haven't found the sound output to me TV. But that's OK since I DO have 315 hours of MP3 music available to my headphones. For these tapes to be more Virtual I need a 110"" screen and theater speakers!!! So the tapes are - OK.",1374278400,,432,4.034883720930233
3616816,2,B001GMX9Q8,"I've seen some nice rave reviews of this DVD.  Indeed, it is MUCH nicer than just staring aimlessly into a blank wall or the program readout of my machine, plus it's more relaxing than consuming cable news while trotting along or spinning along.

I've now sampled a NUMBER of this type of DVD from some various producers. There's actually 5-6 companies that produce this type of exercise tool.  This DVD is more visually enjoyable, I think, than the Scenic Trex SoCal beaches.  At least there's COLOR here.  Bird sounds around your head. However....you move along a narrow forest trail.  Bushes, trees, and forest growth just whiz by endlessly.  Now, that CAN be relaxing for some.  For ME.....it became very monotonous and next-to boring. No ""moving"" life in the video. No people. No music option, no cadence/pace option.  No ""push"" motivator like a coach option or intensity indicator.

After trying various other companies, I am convinced that the best VIRTUAL exercise DVD for those desiring ACTIVE scenery changes and a better technical approach to this medium is best found by doing a word search of those two keywords.

Sure, I'll keep the Scenic Trex Rainforest DVD for periodic use....sometimes I like to just run on the treadmill or elliptical and ""zone out"".  But I generally prefer to be ""engaged"" visually.  This one just doesn't quite get there to my taste.",1366416000,3,1371,4.934497816593886
3616817,5,B001GMX9Q8,I love it - see my remarks for the first DVD. All 3 of the DVD's I purchased are great - each for a different reason. I happen to like the one that is most familiary to my midwest locale - Wis. I feel like I'm outdoors actually hiking in the woods!  (:,1359849600,4,252,3.7547169811320753
3616818,4,B001GMX9Q8,"CONS...The forest blurs and clears constantly as you ""hike"". It had a dizzying effect on me as I walked my treadmill. Either I got used to it as I walked or the problem cleared up. I didn't notice it after the first few minutes.

Too many times the path abruptly stopped and started up somewhere else. It brought me back to reality every time, something I didn't want or need on my fantasy walk.

There are odd sound effects not prevalent in nature. Maybe it's the camera equipment. Whatever it is, it's annoying and distracting. Like me, you'll probably miss the satisfying crunch of leaves beneath a hiker's feet.

PROS... The pace was perfect for a slow walk on the treadmill. On occasion, when I wanted to walk faster, I hit the forward button on my remote. The scene sped up nicely to accommodate my faster trot, but I lost the nature sounds as a trade off.

The camera constantly takes you in an out of the deep jungle, from shade into sunlight and then back into shade. It's a nice variety.

This DVD has no musical background. That's certainly a plus for me.

On my very first hike, I easily quadrupled my walk without even realizing I had done it. This DVD definitely takes your mind off of exercising.

The morning warm up and the waterfall cool down are a waste of space. Both a merely nothing more than a stand-still view of the mountains and a waterfall.",1357689600,6,1367,4.465863453815261
3616819,5,B001GMX9Q8,"SCENIC TREX RAINFOREST is the best DVD in this series. Full of wonder, and it has taken me into the unknown. Filmed in the WEST INDIES, lm somewhere high in the hills, deep in the wildness,and finding myself treking along a very rough, rugged, and narrow track, surrounded by Dense Foliage. I have certainly been spirted away to a compleatly different kind of world. There are some sounds, i hear the whisper of the trees, the wind, and just heard a bird call, That feeling of tension I had is leaving my body.  A little rain has fallen, the path is quite wet .. BUT I CAN JUMP PUDDLES.  Along my walk iv run out of path, and wonder If I can get through all that Dense Bush that is dead ahead of me. But I do, and come out the otherside.  Now I am back on track again, continueing on with my amazing journey. With a feeling of knowing I am somewhere, that very few other people have ever ventured.  ( I have returned to my little bush path for a walk many times )  An isolated and peaceful journey deep in the Wildness of the West Indies.",1339545600,9,1038,4.1959798994974875
3616820,2,B001GMX9Q8,"Some parts felt like slogging through rough territory.  Most of the video follows a path, but some parts appeared like we were breaking new ground.  Could be enjoyable to folks who enjoy rough country terrain and the feeling of being first on the scene.  Some of the turns were quite sharp and a little dizzying at times.",1326585600,3,321,4.5964912280701755
3616821,3,B001GMX9Q8,"Not bad. I purchased this to use while walking on a treadmill. It isn't too bad, but there are others out there that I would recommend more. This video meanders along a lush jungle trail. The audio soundtrack is a little distracting. A musical score might have been nicer, so my solution is to turn down the audio and crank up some Jimi Hendrix on a CD player. Much better. Recommended for people trying to put some time on a treadmill and are just bored silly looking at a wall. We put a 32"" LCD TV on a shelf in front of the treadmill, with an inexpensive DVD player. Also on the shelf is a CD player and a selection of classic rock. It's a nice setup and is much nicer than watching the clock or staring at the wall. I'd like to see similar DVDs of travel destinations perhaps; walking around a small Italian village, countryside hikes in Scotland..... running a New York marathon..... something creative. I have found other DVDs of hikes in National Parks. These are all worthwhile diversions to keep you engaged and moving.",1315872000,2,1028,4.473404255319149
3616822,5,B001GMX9Q8,"This is a great choice for nature lovers, a lower-key option than some, great for those days when I wish I could just go out somewhere and get close to nature, walk around, get some exercise, but the weather isn't right or there isn't anyplace safe or handy nearby or maybe I just don't have time. This is not for those days when I'm ready for extreme sports or competitive exercise. It is an excellent choice when I just want to put in the exercise time and enjoy a little bit of introspection or maybe I'm feeling sorry for myself because I haven't had a chance to spend anytime outside recently. It even works when I have things to think about and don't want to go walking outside deep in thought and run into something.

If you want more action, just add your own music and power through it. It works. It helps to get me past the 'blah' mood where I really just don't want to push myself very hard today. I usually end up being motivated to do much more than I had planned. If I'm already motivated and ready for a all-out workout, I'll choose another DVD that kicks it up a notch and pushes me further than this one. It's all about the day, and the mood, and my goal for that day. The scenery is beautiful, worth the time spent enjoying it. I like to just drink it in, letting my exercise time fly by.",1307491200,4,1306,4.224
3616823,5,B001GMX9Q8,"I truly enjoy this DVD! I can do my treadmill and stay focused on my workout. I can imagine myself right there on the trail and feeling the breezes. I want to get the beach DVD next but am hoping Santa will bring it soon. :) I stay focused better on this than just watching regular tv shows, maybe it's because I'm not trying to stay focused on the actual program on tv and I can focus on my workout. If I'm not watching anything at all though, I get bored and quit. This is definitely worth the money! I usually do a 30 minute walk on the treadmill and I can get 2 walks out of the program before I have to restart it. The quality is clear, there is one tiny spot where it got blurred and it makes me a little dizzy, but it gets clear right away. And now I know where it's at so I expect it. I really enjoy this and hope they will make more with like mountain trails, country lanes, etc. If you are looking for a ""distraction"", that isn't a distraction to your workout, this is the DVD to get!!!!",1291334400,4,997,4.015075376884422
3616824,3,B001GMX9Q8,this one is not as good as the jungle one.  the jungle trex was a lot more open this one is really closterphobic due to everything is closed in and there is not a good view of the mountains water or anything.  so I was disappointed in it..,1285200000,3,239,3.9583333333333335
3616825,3,B001GMX9Q8,"I was looking for some diversified workouts for my eliptical.  This DVD is OK.  It really has only one speed, SLOW.  If I played it in fast forward , the tempo was better but there was no sound.  Am I sorry I purchased it,no.  Would I buy it again, NO",1282867200,2,251,3.94
3616826,2,B001GMX9Q8,I was looking for a DVD to use while using a stationary bike.  This has nice lush scenery but it isn't well suited for bike work.  Runs much too slow and the trails are unrealistic to think you could be biking through them.  Probably ok for someone on a tread mill if they are walking.,1271462400,5,285,4.1454545454545455
8306167,5,B001GMX9Q8,"Love these dvd's.  I purchased 3 of them and all are amazing.  Like I wrote in my other review, its like the missing puzzle piece to having an enjoyable workout.  Beautiful scenery and sound.  Relaxing .",1492041600,,203,4.555555555555555
8306168,5,B001GMX9Q8,Makes using the treadmill a LOT easier.  I don't dread exercise time with this DVD.  Wish I'd gotten it years ago.,1488844800,,114,4.380952380952381
8306169,5,B001GMX9Q8,This walk takes you on a journey of your own through the interior of the densely foliaged rainforest on a little traveled trail.  If you crave a solitary walk surrounded by greenery you will enjoy this.  I am very prone to motion sickness and this video was fine for me.,1488585600,,270,4.38

8306171,1,B001GMX9Q8,"It was boring, there were no sounds of birds or anything, the video was stopped and restarted in various places, so the ""walk"" was interrupted in regards to what you saw.  I don't recommend this video.  And I have not watched it since the first time.",1484352000,,250,4.413043478260869
