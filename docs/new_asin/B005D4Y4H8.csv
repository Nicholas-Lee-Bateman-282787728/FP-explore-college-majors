4657125,5,B005D4Y4H8,"Bought this on a Lightning Deal, and have enjoyed it so far.  There is a lot of content for the money and it is funny to see what Canadien Broadcasting was like several decades ago.  Oh, and there is some good piano playing as well.  Gould seems like he was an interesting, if not a little strange, person.  It's sad that he died so young of a stroke.",1322956800,2,351,4.117647058823529
4657126,5,B005D4Y4H8,"...would not be enough for this extraordinary treasure trove of intelligence and beauty. You get to see Gould in real time, talking at length about the music that meant everything to him -- not just Bach and Schoenberg, but Richard Strauss. Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Beethoven, among others. These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose... This set is the bargain of the century at the present amazon price ($72.99) but even if it goes back up to list price the decision to buy this would be a no-brainer. Wow.",1320192000,54,784,4.814814814814815
4657127,5,B005D4Y4H8,"A fabulous 19 hours of music and commentary from, in my humble opinion, the greatest pianist ever.
Glenn Gould has exquisite taste in music, as well as the ability to share his enthusiasm and passion.
A natural teacher, explaining complex musical terms in a way that ordinary, non-musical people can easily understand.
Then, he plays.  You can see and hear the absolute joy of his playing.  Awe-inspiringly beautiful.
There is a lot of playing and some pieces have not been recorded elsewhere.  So, this is a real treat for Glenn Gould fans to hear ""new"" recordings.

He stopped giving concerts in 1964.  And I think he wanted listeners to have a more up-close and personal experience of music than the concert hall distant relationship.  You will get that up-close and personal experience with this set.

This DVD collection is a ""must have"" for any person who loves music, and for anyone who wants to learn more about music.
It will most certainly entertain, educate, and delight.",1317340800,79,982,4.879518072289157
4657128,5,B005D4Y4H8,"The CBC deserves credit for having the foresight to take on a challenge as tough as Gould, stick with him over the years, document his genius and eccentricities. and then just lay it all out--help yourself. take what you wish. No adornment. Just a majestic, and erratic artistry that Gould could shape better than anyone: --move from Beethoven to Hindemith, Prokofieff to Petula Clark (not to mention Bach--which is unnecessary), and defy you to look elsewhere while he was at work, or play. I was privileged to be at CBC in Toronto some those days, and I can only thank the stars that , someone, perhaps only a janitor, made the decision to put such a treasure in a vault, or more likely, stow it away in a closet until somebody else could decide what to do with it. Well what was put away was not only the blueprint of one of the most daring, exciting and fulfilling artists of our day, but a generous and talkative--yes he was that--endowing us with his insight into the music of our time. And he gave us a hell of a lot of fun doing it.",1444089600,3,1040,4.393782383419689

4657132,5,B005D4Y4H8,"There is some irresistible musical television history here. I have some of the Glenn Gould laserdiscs that were issued previously by Sony in 1992, but the programs were chopped up and scattered over the discs in new, almost random configurations under dubious umbrella categories. Now, thankfully, the programs seem to be restored to their original uncut state, and they make far more coherent sense this way. There's a lot to learn and a lot to absorb from Glenn, and it is best taken one program at a time. But if you don't watch out, you'll find yourself binge watching without end.  My favorite moments so far Glenn addresses his peculiarly prepared piano in a Bach program ( ""This is a neurotic piano; it thinks it's a harpsichord.""), and  a young Zubin Mehta, upon hearing the iconoclastic pianist's rationale for giving up concerts, says that Glenn is ""out of his mind!""  At $22.29, or 80% off the list price, this is an unbelievable steal.",1435190400,2,947,4.7975460122699385

It's OK to write a fugue!

A great gift to musicians or serious music fans.",1426550400,3,311,4.5

4657137,5,B005D4Y4H8,"As good as it gets. Gould is nothing short of brilliant, although half the time the time I don't know what he's talking about. But fascinating to listen to. A MUST for all serious Glenn Gould fans.",1414454400,,197,4.351351351351352
4657138,5,B005D4Y4H8,"Really great DVDs. I could go on and on and on about it, but, needless to say, this is amazing. I was really impressed about the quality of sound in these DVDs. Even some of the older performances were of amazing sound quality. My quiet smart TV actually sounded load when I play these DVDs, which is a rarity. Sometimes, I have a hard time even hearing vids at full volume. Also, the price at $35 is a steal. IF YOU LIKE GOULD, YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS. Plus, I couldn't notice any problems with synching, as some other reviewers complained about.",1411776000,4,544,4.3431372549019605
4657139,5,B005D4Y4H8,"Okay, black and white.  And they are trying - and succeeding - to be scholarly, so the talks are a bit dry.  But this is a quite upmarket musical mind with a truly huge range whose opinions are well worth taking into consideration.  And the performances on the DVDs are in the excellent to fabulous range.  One thing I will say:  In the performance with Yehudi Menuhin of a Beethoven violin and piano sonata, I have seen two versions of this.  Both were done in a private home.  One camera operator was from the broadcasting company, and the other camera was operated by Mrs. Menuhin.  Glenn is all buttoned up and scholarly in the broadcast version, so okay, yes, we now know what this sonata sounds like.  But Mrs. Menuhin's caught the pianist  looking into the camera with eyes positively glittering in delight, a sight never to be forgotten.  And that, alas, is not included in this set.  I still give it 5 stars, because of the information and life's work of a very in-depth (and then some) ""live wire"" musician, with all the energy of youth, that it presents.",1391731200,13,1065,4.5473684210526315
4657140,5,B005D4Y4H8,"These ten DVD's contain a treasure chest of Gould's performances, interviews, even music appreciation lectures he made for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  The earlier discs are in Black & White, the later ones in color; all are very watchable thought of course not state of the art; the sound quality is very good reproducing Gould's exquisite touch at the keyboard.  For myself, I can find no flaws to point out to would-be purchasers.",1390089600,10,444,5.068493150684931
4657141,2,B005D4Y4H8,"A heartbreaking production failure. Every single moment of every DVD from the set that I've examined is out of sync by about 1/5 second with the audio, which is a *huge* gap. It makes the whole lot completely unwatchable for me, so it was a waste of money.",1373673600,14,256,4.354166666666667
4657142,5,B005D4Y4H8,These Glenn Gould DVD's are treasure trove of transcendent playing. He plays with a spiritual depth that is surpassed only by Yehudi Menuhin among players of the twentieth century.

4657143,5,B005D4Y4H8,"What can one say watching these videos?!  Only one thing: it is a pity that Glenn Gould left us so early and it is a blessing that he spent so many hours, days, months and years in studio and left us with absolutely great memories of him.",1350518400,2,238,4.0638297872340425
4657144,5,B005D4Y4H8,"These gems that were readily available to Canadian television audiences -- and a sporadic list of other locations -- is surely to excite and entertain any Gould fan. I love how his eclectic mind comes through on these recordings.

UPDATE:

Wow! I just looked at the price (18. Feb 2012). What happened to it? It's $109.98. I bought this set three weeks ago for $59.99.",1329523200,8,368,4.6461538461538465

A few days ago I thought of this situation again, and for kicks and giggles I logged on the internet with the intent of contacting the CBC about my years-old request.  Lo and behold, no contact was necessary.  I rubbed my eyes, but it was true.  The DVD transfer had been available since fall.
  Now I feel like a kid at Christmas waiting on this set to arrive.  For Gould aficionados no explanation is needed.  For lovers of Bach and fine keyboard playing who aren't familiar, listen to Gould's Goldbergs or his WTC I and II.",1326931200,22,635,4.367521367521367
