4089681,5,B0038N9WK0,"""El Mago"" is another triumph in Cantinflas' (Fortino Mario Alfonso Moreno Reyes, 1911-1993) long and distinguished career. This very famous Mexican actor, who Charlie Chaplin once referred to as ""the greatest comedian alive,"" clearly made films covering almost every topic that he could make fun of (e.g. the circus, firemen, pilots, boxers, politicians, priests, bullfighters, etc.), while at the same time finding space to inject some social commentary. ""El Mago"" is a hilarious film that follows that trend, showcasing his comic genius.

The story begins with the death of the king of Hariche, a fictitious city in the Far East. His advisors decided that they should try to locate Krisnar, his only son and sole inheritor, who lives in Mexico. Krisnar is a respected fortune-teller in that country.

Unfortunately, while the king's advisors are on the way, Krisnar becomes sick, and his doctor advises him to take a vacation. He also advises him that he could be replaced by somebody that looks just like him, and that can also perfectly do his work. For this purpose, he approaches the ""You alter ego"" clinic, where he surely finds a perfect replacement. As it happens, Cantinflas also works in that establishment. However, one day, Krisnar's replacement had to meet his girlfriend and asks Cantinflas to cover for him for just some hours, which he agrees to do. As you can imagine, that is the beginning of and creates some funny moments. Cantinflas' problems include being mistaken by the king's advisors; his uncle wanting to kill him because he thinks he is the legitimate inheritor of the crown; some thieves wanting to kidnap him, in order that he can help them with their crimes; and a mysterious woman chasing him for an equally mysterious purpose.

""El Mago,"" which I think should have been called ""The Fortune-teller"" instead, is guaranteed to make you laugh, and will truly make you miss yesteryear's comedies. It also has a great production design. This is Cantinflas at his best. (Mxico, 1949, B&W, 100 min). NOTE: In addition to ""El Circo"", Sony Pictures is also releasing ""A Volar Joven,"" ""El Gendarme desconocido,"" ""El Circo,"" El Seor Fotgrafo,"" ""Los Tres Mosqueteros,"" and ""Si Yo fuera Diputado."" Furthermore, Sony is also re-releasing such classics as ""El Bolero de Raquel,"" ""El Analfabeto,"" ""El Padrecito,"" and ""Su Excelencia.""
