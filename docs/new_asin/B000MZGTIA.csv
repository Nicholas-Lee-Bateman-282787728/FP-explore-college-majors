8173693,5,B000MZGTIA,"My comment should read I'd love to see this movie....alas, I need the zone for North America, not the ""2"" that is being sold. Anyone have a suggestion? merci! And I don't need the subtitles...",1506384000,,192,4.514285714285714
8173694,1,B000MZGTIA,"Dont buy this at all!! You have to live in a certain area for it to be viewable. I live in California and expected to watch it with subtitles in English. It said I didn't live in the right zone to view it. So essentially, it ended up in the trash.",1480723200,,247,3.8627450980392157
8173695,5,B000MZGTIA,"An excellent story well-presented, even if you have to read the English subtitles to get it. ""Start Walking"" as the English title doesn't really capture the idea that there is an irony in the French title drawing attention to the traditional ""pilgrimages"" folks make to St. Jacques or to Mecca, depending on their religions.",1466035200,,324,5.018518518518518
8173696,5,B000MZGTIA,"Living in the UK, it seems a bit weird having to order this DVD from the US, but hey, c'est la vie. The only version with English subs.

This is the only film that encapsulates the real experience of the camino de Santiago, its external and internal struggles, the camaraderie, the sheer beauty of the landscapes and the good fellowship. Then it goes further, providing a real human interest story without sentiment and plenty of comic episodes to balance the fierce thrust and parry of the three warring siblings, compelled to walk together in order to secure their inheritance.

Then it goes further, mixing some truly audacious fantasy dream sequences that defy interpretation. Not since Woody Allen's field full of upturned coffins in Love & Death have I seen such ingenious weirdness. Granted, they do rather breeze through the Spanish part, but the intention of the director surely isn't to incite tourism.

The final sequence in Santiago offers camera perspectives on the Mass that are more beautiful than what you actually see at ground level, but that aside this film is sure to set veteran peregrinos hankering after another crack at the camino and others will be able to explain their motivation with something better than, ""Well, I saw this Martin Sheen film, perhaps you've heard of it...""

Superb movie.",1439769600,,1317,4.972727272727273

8173698,5,B000MZGTIA,"Very funny movie, I do really like it a lot.  I bought it for a present and instead I kept it for me.",1402272000,,101,3.391304347826087
8173699,5,B000MZGTIA,"I'm like the thousands of people who walk the Santiago de Compostela trail every year in that once we're back home, it's an ache to go back.  Finding a gem of a movie like ""Saint Jacques...La Mecque"" is a gift.  Written by the talented Coline Serreau, who also wrote the original French ""Three Men and a Baby"" it's as polished a piece of film storytelling as I've seen in years.  Highly recommended.
(The English subtitles are very easy to read.)",1388880000,,446,4.55
8173700,5,B000MZGTIA,"A funny story of 3 siblings who have no relationship, who are forced, by their mother's last will and testament, to walk the Camino Frances.  I thoroughly enjoyed this flick.",1374105600,,174,4.8
8173701,5,B000MZGTIA,"Whether you have walked the Camino or are planning to do so, or just want to share the dream, this is a movie to see!  The dialogues in French are SO good , I do hope the English subtitles do them justice. It is a story about people more than about hiking. Very touching, sad, funny, hilarious at times. It shows how the Way transforms and brings the best out of everyone. A movie to see again and again!",1372032000,,404,4.113924050632911
8173702,5,B000MZGTIA,Waited so long to finally get the movie. Very funny and brings back memories of the scenery hiking the Camino.,1366588800,,110,4.55
