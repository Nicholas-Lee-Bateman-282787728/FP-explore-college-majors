6284255,5,B00ION69AK,Gave this to my husband for Father's Day and he loved it!,1404691200,,57,3.8333333333333335
6284256,4,B00ION69AK,"""The Nutty Professor"" based on the Story of Robert Louis Stevenson ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" and is in the Box on
1 (Codefree) Blu-Ray and 1 DVD (has Regional Code 1).

The picture quality on the BR is good. The BR contains some Bonus-Features like Bloopers, deleted scenes, behind the scenes and 3 documentaries with a lenght of 1 hour together. One ""No apologies"" is a conversation, another show parts of his career and interviews with Stella Stevens.

Sadly those are BY FAR TO SHORT for a great comedian like Jerry Lewis. He deserves more!!!

""The Nutty Professor"" might be not my favorite of the Jerry Lewis movies but a very good one and contains gags which was used again for ""Family Matters"" and Eddie Murphy made a remake (produced by Jerry Lewis himself!). Its a true comic-masterpiece. Common - Murphy was only half that good.

In this Box are two more DVDs with two movies:

""Cinderfella"" (Jerry Lewis as Cinderella)
and
""The Errand Boy"" - a fantastic comedy (ok, it doesn't have really a ""Story"") but has some great gags. Its a parody about the movie studios and plays in the fictional studio ""Paramutual"" (which means clearly ""Paramount"" which was filmed ""on location) and has a great Cameo of the ""Bonanza""-Cast.
My favorite Gag is the Cantine/Candy-Shop Scene. In one word: thats fantastic comedy!

The Box has some goodies:

1 CD with a couple of tracks where Jerry is doing some phone-calls and joking with people on the other end.
3 Booklets: 1 with sketches, 1 Storyboard, 1 with excepts from the Script from ""The Nutty Professor""

FAZIT: sure, not everybody likes Jerry Lewis. But Jerry Lewis is a fantastic and very talented actor, Comedian, Entertainer! Hopefully ""Scared Stiff"" will be restored which is my favorite of Jerry's work.",1403222400,4,1756,4.810631229235881
6284257,5,B00ION69AK,"Picked it up today at Barnes & Noble (they have a 50% blu ray sale going)..... and I am thrilled!
The blu ray looks great (but lets face it the DVD that has been out was very strong and didn't need a major upgrade or restoration). The bonus features have thankfully been kept and an absolutely wonderful new 20 minute featurette is included that I consider a game changer of an  addition. To have this giant of comedy spend 20 minutes talking about his life in widescreen 1080p is great for me!  This isn't redundant if you have the wonderful documentary on Mr Lewis either!  The bonus CD of prank calls is funny, not essential and the two bonus films on DVD , well any true fan has them already and I am and do (Cinderfella and The Errand Boy are excellent and contain nice bonus features but nothing new.  The bonus books, and artwork are very cool....

It is likely I would wait until September and just buy the single Blu Ray ... if it weren't for he fact that with discounts and a coupon I ended up paying a bit over 20 bucks for this set today.  I understand the single disc blu will be available in September, so if you are out of shelf space, already own the bonus DVD films and want to save cash.... that is a great option as well.",1401840000,9,1240,4.233050847457627
6284258,4,B00ION69AK,"The Nutty Professor 50th Anniversary Collectors Edition is an elaborate box set tribute to the comedy of Jerry Lewis. The academic of the title is Julius F. Kelp (Lewis), a shy, bumbling chemistry teacher who has a mad crush on his student Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens). Kelp develops a magic potion that turns him into smooth and smarmy nightclub singer Buddy Love. Stella is drawn to Buddy, but the potions formula is unstable and Buddy keeps slipping back into Julius at embarrassing moments.

Lewis films have grossed over $800 million. He was the top box office star (along with Dean Martin) from 1952 to 1956, and solo from 1957 to 1964. He has appeared in more than 50 movies, directed a dozen, and was a familiar face on television. He also appeared on Broadway and on tour in Damn Yankees (1994-1997). He is credited with initiating the technique of placing a video camera next to the motion picture camera (the Video Assist) so he could play back his scenes and direct himself. The method has been commonplace for decades in the movie industry.

In addition to The Nutty Professor, the 4-disc Blu-ray set includes the features Cinderfella (1960) and The Errand Boy (1961); the CD Phoney Phone Calls (Lewis secretly recorded prank phone calls); a new profile of Lewis; 48-page storyboard book; 44-page cutting script with Lewis notes; bloopers; outtakes; commentary by Jerry Lewis and Steve Lawrence; and Being a Person, a 96-page book of quotes and drawings inspired or written by Jerry Lewis and drawn by his personal illustrator.",1401494400,3,1541,4.923076923076923

6284267,4,B00ION69AK,"The very first BLU RAY release of the famous THE NUTTY PROFESSOR finally arrives in a deluxe boxset..Jerry lewis is magnificent as the professor,which also includes three more movies and a cd of personal prank phone calls .The set contails several books and scripts duplicates of jerry's work making the nutty professor. The other three movies nutty professor standard version, the errand boy and cinderfella are included but only in standard dvd form. The problem with both dvd movies are they have not been cleaned up or even been fixed up ,there are still in some parts of them unfocused and scratches and grainy as well but not throught the pictures. For example the famous elevator scene of the bubblegum on jerrys face when he comes out there are two scratch lines that go from top to bottom right on jerrys face and the gentleman with bubble gum on his face as well when he comes out. The two lines continue when the scene is swicthed over to his  boss at the errand facility and disappears ,the lines are very annoying. Scracthes on and off throught out some parts of both cinderfella and errand. Now on the blu ray nutty professor the movie has been cleaned up to a point but throught out the movie there are grains and  some unfocused  elements in and out through the movies. This set is a good set but it is in no way whatsoever an excellent set. THIS set deserves a 4 star out of five ,one star meaning the cleaning up or restoration still needs to be done. JERRY LEWIS deserves credit for giving us some of the most unique comedy ever to be put on film. Overall the boxset still is a must in any collection,in a month or so the blu ray of the nutty professor will be out on a single disk. Its a fun set filled with bloopers and outtakes and deleted scenes.........the boxset also contains magnificent pictures of jerry on front and back and inside the boxset which is also a magnetized flip open case.",1405209600,2,1914,4.494252873563219

A great movie with a lot of stuff.",1405123200,,99,3.347826086956522
6284269,5,B00ION69AK,"Wonderful collector's edition.  There's a lot of goodies in the box with the movie.  The only thing I didn't like were the two extra DVD movies added to this set.

The Errand Boy is  a poorly written script... or just bad.  He's supposed to be a spy for the company, but not  once throughout the whole  movie does he do any spying.  He was more of a saboteur than anything else in his series of  short sketches.

Cinderfella,  is  another bad one.  Long drawn out sketches that were boring.  There was no character  development with the princess.  There was no reason for her to  go for the guy.  And the dance scene was badly done.  It should have a been a waltz and not a made up, off the cuff dance.

Anyway, it's called the Nutty Professor so I didn't penalize it for  the two bad movies.",1404950400,,792,4.2517006802721085
8644186,5,B00ION69AK,Top package. Get it while it is still available especially his booklet in being a better human being that was giving to the film crew.

The movie's theme song is an uptempo big band version of Stella By Starlight, perhaps demonstrating the comedian's enamor with his beautiful co-star Stella Stevens.",1419724800,,362,5.368421052631579
