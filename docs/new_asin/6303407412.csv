8495846,1,6303407412,The video even though outdated has some great images. It arrived unusable. The casing was broken long before shipping and the tape was placed in the paper case strategically so that you could not see right away that is was damaged. Thankfully I had an old VHS tape that I was willing to sacrifice and I transferred this one into another case. I should have returned the item but I really wanted to view the tape for a project. Too expensive for arriving in such a poor condition.,1353974400,,479,4.454545454545454
