8267259,5,B0017TZ594,"As a middle school and high school drama teacher, I found this video very useful for students who wanted to do makeup for plays, but didn't know anything about it (and I didn't have enough time to take them through all the steps).  It visually shows, step by step, how to apply theatrical make up for a variety of purposes.  It also clarifies what materials are needed.  I highly recommend it for those working with high school and middle school students.",1211673600,,455,4.592592592592593
