8048793,4,B0007M6O92,I enjoyed the video.  However following the instructor was a little challenging as he goes through the breakdown of the steps quickly.  I became good friends with the rewind button. This would probably not be the best video for the rank beginner (I consider myself an advanced beginner).  An intermediate or advanced dancer would probably give it 5 stars.,1465862400,,355,4.983050847457627
8048794,5,B0007M6O92,"I purchased this video after taking an african dance workshop with Moustapha Bangoura in 2008. I have taken african dance aerboic classes before and thought I was in for the same thing. Boy, was I wrong. The dances of Guinea are very athletic. I was stretching, leaping, and grasping for breath. This was a serious class, like if I were a professional dancer, but not. I enjoyed it, but needed to be able to practice the moves at home, so I would not look like a complete idiot at the next lesson. I purchased Tinkanyi 1 and 2. The videos would be difficult to follow if I had not taken this class. Each video is comprised of a warm-up, 4 dances, that include an introduction (provides history of the dance and some footage of africans performing the dance). Followed by the breakdown, were Moustapha breaks down the performance. This is fast paced and you will have to rewind several times to get the dance moves down. Then the last section is the performance, which Moustapha and about 6 dancers perform the dance at tempo. After warming up, I usually workout using the breakdown and performance for each dance. This is authentic Guinea dancing, no waterd-down african moves mixed with aerobics in this video. Be warned, theres is a lot of jumping in Guinea dancing, so be prepared and enjoy.",1270598400,,1294,4.655021834061135
8048795,5,B0007M6O92,"I tried different African Dance videos and liked this best.
Each volume comprise 4 dance styles.
They first show the cultural background of each dance
with footages from African village, followed by thrilling presentation
of the master and great accompanying dancers.
The breakdown of each steps are simple and easy to follow.
The live band is hot enough to get you down on the floor.
Highly recommended, Both vol. 1 and 2.",1190937600,,423,4.888888888888889
