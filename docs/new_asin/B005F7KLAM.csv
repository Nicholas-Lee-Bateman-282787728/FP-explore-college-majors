8565985,4,B005F7KLAM,"Movie is in Cantonese with English subtitles even though the subtitles are a bit fast.  This movie has a good story that's easy to understand even though the story seems incomplete at the end.  A young man who likes to gamble and cheat is saved by a kung-fu master who is looking for a set of books that has 42 chapters of the Ming (previous dynasty) loyalists creed/kung-fu/treasure guides that promises to destroy the Qing (current) dynasty.  The young man's mother works as an escort at a brothel, so there are quite a few funny moments in the movie.  The kung-fu master and the young man become friends and are eventually chased by the Qing officers, and they both end up in the royal family's home captured by a top ranking eunuch (men whose private parts are cut off to serve the royal family with high authorities).  The top eunuch is blinded by the young man's trickery on his medicine.  The young man then fakes himself as a low level eunuch himself to assist the top eunuch.  In doing so, the young man eventually meets and befriends the Qing emperor without knowledge that his friend is an emperor.  The two then practices their kung-fu.  The emperor learns kung-fu from his mother while the young man learns from the top eunuch.  By the time the young man learns his friend is the emperor, he also learns that the emperor's mother is a fake, and the top eunuch has an interest to destroy the emperor's mother and the young man.  Everyone seems to be after this set of books, but different people have different parts of the set.  For the books to be useful, they must collect the entire set, so everyone is trying to kill each other for the set.  This movie doesn't have many fight scenes, but the fights are well choreographed.",1519689600,,1740,4.538461538461538
8565986,2,B005F7KLAM,It looked like it could be a funny movie but the captioning went by so fast I couldn't consistently read it to really understand what was going on.,1506729600,,147,4.285714285714286
8565987,5,B005F7KLAM,"Five stars, a different kind of kung fu movie out of the Shaw Bros. here. I enjoyed it, a man has an adventure and in the process saves his mother from being a whore.",1504396800,,166,3.911764705882353
8565988,3,B005F7KLAM,"Some funny moments, lots of intrigue, murder, betrayal and more betrayal. All because of a treasure map. It starts out going in one direction and then goes off track and then tries to return to the original story. It was hard to figure out what is going on a lot of the time. A lot of slapstick that the Chinese seem to like so much and an adolescent sex joke near the beginning and the end.",1504224000,,391,4.157894736842105
8565989,3,B005F7KLAM,"The 3 stars are just for the fight scenes, which are pretty well done. The movie itself is an example of Hong Kong comedy, circa 1980, which I admit to having a strong aversion to due to its silly, slapstick character. The young ""hero"" is not actually a eunuch, but gets involved in a myriad of palace intrigues, including conspiracy, theft, betrayal and even murder. It's all a little ridiculous because the hero is a bit of a dopey sap, and sometimes seems to engage in extreme risks merely on impulse. There are several strong sexual references in the movie but they are distinctly adolescent and more annoying than funny or provocative. The only nudity involves the bare backsides of old men, also annoying though intended to be humorous. After thinking about these criticisms maybe I should have given it 2 stars! And the soundtrack was left in the original Cantonese not translated into Mandarin or English.",1503619200,,913,4.821656050955414
8565990,4,B005F7KLAM,"Without a doubt, the wackiest kung fu movie I've ever seen.  A riot of poisons, pressure points, food fights, sexual hi-jinx, masks, doubles and martial arts that are bloody mayhem. It's a wild ride where you can never guess what's going to happen next, but you can bet it will make you laugh.",1503532800,,293,4.528301886792453
8565991,5,B005F7KLAM,"Granted not everything ever presented by SB is perfect in my eyes but this one ranks as one of the best ones I've seen to date. It had action, comedy, suspense, plot twists, all well blended together. Simply put - works for me.",1461369600,,227,4.3023255813953485
