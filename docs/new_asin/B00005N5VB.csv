7946408,5,B00005N5VB,"This VHS tape is a great treat for any Mumfie fan, as it contains some of the funniest and most entertaining moments of the series. From Mumfie's hiccup fit trying to help Fifi to a funny argument between Napoleon and Bristle, this tape will make anyone from ages 2 to 102 smile the whole way through. The first story, ""Things That Go Bump"", involves Mumfie and friends being scared after a story from Napoleon about night noises in the castle. The second story, ""Making A Stand"", involves Mumfie feeling ignored by Scarecrow since he works for the farmer and has no time to play with him on the job, and after learning from Whale that that ""a scarecrow has to do what a scarecrow has to do"", he's asked by Bristle to be a scarecrow-or so he thinks. In the third story, Fifi Takes A Vacation, Mumfie and Scarecrow are in charge of Potace A Go-Go when Fifi and Napoleon go on a romantic vacation, and help serve Pinkey and her mother. In the last story, ""If Wishes Were Pancakes"" a misunderstanding after going on a picnic with some friends leads to Mumfie getting pancakes for every meal.
My only gripe with this tape is that the back cover shows NO images of the episodes on this tape like the last volume does (where all of them were from the first episode on the tape, Scarecrow's Birthday Surprise). The image on the spine is just a stock image, the first two images on the back of the tape are from the ""Mumfie's Quest"" arc of the show, and the last is from Scarecrow's Birthday Surprise, which they mistook for a very similar scene in Things That Go Bump. Aside from that, this tape is a pretty good buy for toddlers, and is better than all those shows for toddlers that either talk down to them or have main characters who never learn their lesson (I'm looking at you, Nina Needs to Go!). Mumfie is an excellent show for toddlers and is definitley entertainment to grow up with.",1433894400,,1885,4.435158501440922
