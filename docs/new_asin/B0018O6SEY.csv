3417856,5,B0018O6SEY,"This is an awesome silent film! Great light plot with some drama here and there, nice dialogue, a dash of humor, add William Boyd and you've got a great film!
As for this version, it's not crystal clear and there are some flaws occasionally, but it's actually pretty good picture quality for not being remastered. A highly recommended movie - wish Amazon would put out more movies like this (such as The Volga Boatman, Two Arabian Knights, etc.)",1435795200,,445,4.717948717948718

3417863,4,B0018O6SEY,"...with Hopalong  (Cassidy that is...!)  This is a wonderful look at the some of the last of the very fast Ships of Sail...and yes, it is a silent movie.  In spite of that, the video is in pretty good shape , the musical accompaniment leaves a bit to be deisred.  If you are a lip reader you may actually be able to follow the story.  I was interested because of William Boyd.  this is a very young william Boyd.  As I have gotten older, I realize that William Boyd, as my childhood hero Hopalong Cassidy,was indeed very much older than I suspected... to me he was Hoppy.  Well, this is not Hoppy, however, it was a very enjoyable look at some sailing history, with a bit of easy going mellow-drama thrown in.  Enjoy...",1368576000,2,719,4.345864661654136
3417864,3,B0018O6SEY,"""The Yankee Clipper"" (1927), a Cecil B. DeMille production directed by Rupert Julian, is highly entertaining hokum but it is notable because it was largely photographed at sea on an 1856 well-founded wooden sailing ship which passes almost perfectly as a real clipper ship of the period.  Unfortunately, Televista's DVD edition is cheap and sloppy:  their source material is a duped copy of a 16mm print, so the b&w picture quality leaves much to be desired; it is also quite incomplete compared to a competing and much handsomer Flicker Alley release of the same film in its anthology DVD ""Under Full Sail."" That the Televista version has a longer running time than Flicker Alley's is due entirely to the video transfer being at a very much slower frame rate (painfully slow, in my opinion -- there is no fixed, established running speed for silent films). The music on the Televista release is a ""needle-drop"" score from phonograph records which works well for some scenes and is completely inappropriate for others. In the interest of full disclosure, I restored the version released by Flicker Alley, so although I am not a disinterested observer, I am very aware of the relative completeness and image quality of the two editions mentioned here.",1238198400,20,1250,4.976076555023924

8270259,5,B0018O6SEY,"Many-Many years ago I saw clips from the movie [Silent Please] and I finally got my chance. It was made in 1927 when they were still using clipper ship, the days of iron men and wooden ships. its a silent movie with a lot of  action. The best part is to see real ship not computer graphs. Using 1927 technicality there are some unbelievable shots and for the time special affects. If you want to take a trip back in time, this  one of the movie to do it with.",1457308800,2,459,4.088888888888889

8270263,5,B0018O6SEY,"Yes, it is a silent flick..but take some time out and pay attention. It really was a pleasant path from the usual high graphics & high crap often in movies.
