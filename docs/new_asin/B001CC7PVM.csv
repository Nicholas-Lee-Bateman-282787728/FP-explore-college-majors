3507709,5,B001CC7PVM,"Willowbrook is a moving documentary about the lives of adults who are mentally disabled.  I have never heard of the Staten Island, New York school before watching this documentary.  I am shocked that thousands of people lived in such deplorable conditions for decades.  Reporter Geraldo Rivera first exposed Willowbrook as an overcrowded and understaffed facility in 1972.  The school closed in 1987, and some of the former residents have gone on to live productive lives.  The message of this documentary is that people with mental disabilities should be given the change to reach their potential, no matter what that is.  I am touched by the story of Benard Carabello.  He was diagnosed with mental retardation when he actually has cerebral palsy.  He now leads a full active life as a disability advocate.  I am also touched by the story of the late Luis Rivera.  This young man did not have the ability to communicate verbally, but he communicated such warmth and love through his smile and facial gestures.  This documentary definitely increases my compassion for people with disabilities.",1223164800,49,1094,5.089887640449438
3507710,5,B001CC7PVM,"This documentary is a heartfelt account of the effects upon individuals and families of the policy that treated people worse than ASPCA would have allowed for animals.  Unfortunately, not many people know how some of our children with disabilities were once treated, and for that reason, everyone should see this documentary.  Although the film may be modest in technique and a few years old, it documents something that should not be forgotten.  It is hard to believe this existed here in the USA only a few years ago.  Those viewers more interested in content than packaging will be greatly moved by this film.",1223164800,20,612,4.912621359223301
3507711,3,B001CC7PVM,"This is worth a watch to perhaps see just a glimpse of how mental hospitals ran back around that time (1972) (and see how they were before that; they had to start somewhere; it didn't just start in 1972), and yes, it was not an unusual thing for that type of treatment to take place; once this came to light, many other places where discovered to be close to the same. They just push the mentally ill/handicapped away and it becomes ""out of sight, out of mind"". Back before this, if someone had autism, aspergers syndrome, down syndrome, depression..etc; they were labeled ""mentally ill"" and treated terribly, just like almost all the mentally ill.

I grew up around people that had/has mental health issues and worked in an insane asylum (which was the most scariest job I have ever had) when I was younger and to be bluntly honest, if you don't have great insurance, you do not get any help; barely even mediocre help. Once the insurance runs out, you're filed as ""cured"" and then kicked out, but if you're still ""sick"", and lucky to have family by your side, you go to places like Willowbrook; places that just milk you for what's left of your insurance (or none whatsoever).. you're placed in corners and in rooms and forgotten about.

It tells you about the families, the patients and how Rivera felt during and about this, along with his backstory with this event. For the time frame (1997), it's a good documentary on the subject. It's based on true events. Don't expect it to be flashy, like most in the reviewers expected; It's a documentary about a terrible event in history - I still remember when it hit the news for the second time and even then, it still hit everyone hard.",1506211200,10,1687,4.564356435643564

It is so disgusting that a place like that actually existed and am happy that it was shut down. Whenever I see a person with disabilities I see a person who can teach the world how to love and be kind to each other. That's what this film shows !!!!

3507714,1,B001CC7PVM,"The doc. was amateurish, boring, shallow, dated and never left the starting gate.  If these zombies, called parents, visited ONE time and witnessed the way these kids smelled, looked, and acted they would have swept those kids away faster than a jet taking off.  Visiting every 5 or 10 yrs was indicative of people who chose NOT to be responsible for the care of God's and their own child.  God said there is NOTHING by chance.  We make choices.  What we witnessed was the mind set of slavery.  In these circumstances the enslaved mind gives consent to a ""master"" with a degree next to his name because ""slaves don't think for themselves"", they operate from the lower energies of the flesh which allow ""masters"" outside of themselves to control and direct them.  HOW could these people allow their child to be tortured every day for a lifetime?  Because they come from generational, false beliefs that they are dirt bodies instead of Spirit filled Commanders of their own destinies.and have NEVER connected back to Spirit in order to lead and master the flesh.  They, therefore, know not the things of wisdom and understanding from God the Spirit.  Because THEY reject God they don't receive the things of God.  Rejecting their children, therefore, comes from their reprobate minds.  You all have been a witness to what rejecting God looks and sounds like and what the aftermath of living without Him IS.  YOU who stand looking at only one tiny part of a canvas without seeing the entire story are those who are STILL operating without God.  Deaf and blind by your own hand.  You missed the answer to all problems because you do not live AS Spirit.  This torture continues every day in the form of prisons, wars, porn - even from Amazon - child slavery, human abuse toward all God's children of the world, murdering God's children in the womb.  Shocked!  Shocked!  YOU'RE part of ALL of it!",1505520000,2,1890,4.724770642201835

3507719,4,B001CC7PVM,"Overall it was a very touching documentary. However...I feel as though the conditions of Willowbrook were just briefly ""discussed"" and important questions were overlooked. WHY was this allowed to go on for so long when there were CLEARLY families that were aware of the deplorable conditions? Has anyone ever been held accountable? They need to be. I feel as though this documentary needs a follow up or part 2. It is absolutely inhumane and disgusting the way the occupants were treated. No matter what the general view society held of the mentally disabled at this point in history. Human beings should never ever be treated this way and the human beings responsible SHOULD be exposed.",1502841600,5,687,4.982608695652174

3507739,4,B001CC7PVM,"I worked in the field of mental retardation for nearly thirty-five years. My first job was in an institution for people with mental retardation in Michigan, starting in 1971. I took the job because things were so deplorable that I couldn't walk away from what I saw and experienced. I wanted to make things better for the people living in that  institution. Fortunately, over the years many positive changes were implemented, not just in Michigan, but in other states. The terrible conditions uncovered and publicized at Willowbrook by Geraldo Rivera, fortunately made positive changes in Michigan's institutional system for the mentally retarded, but it also had a tremendous impact across the nation. Many sweeping changes were made, and ultimately these institutions were closed down, and people with mental retardation are now integrated in their local communities where they receive needed and appropriate services, and where they work and contribute to their community. Thank God for Geraldo Rivera who uncovered and made public the existing conditions at Willowbrook--conditions that no human being should live in. This book reminds us of what was and never should have been and shows us what is possible and what now is. Let us never forget Willowbrook!",1416614400,,1261,5.27363184079602

the profoundly devastating effect it has on families. These people are human beings and should have been treated with respect and compassion. Where is the public outcry and indignation?This type of thing  must never be allowed to happen
again. We can not put a lot of disabled people together as in Willowbrook or in any type of orphanage, where there is no hope. They must be part of the community, not kept away from the community. Do not turn your back on these people.
This is a must see movie that will open your eyes and your heart.

3507745,5,B001CC7PVM,"I am at odds giving a high rating for this film because of the subject matter. The rating however is for the respect, honesty, and detail given by the filmmakers. For anyone that has researched any of the tragedies of our forgotten or hidden neighbors, the story of Willowbrook will forever haunt our dreams.

Much like Pennhurst and others, the patients of Willowbrook were put into a situation where finance committees determined that saving money was more important than human dignity. This left the residents of these ""care facilities"" in a situation where there were never enough resources to give them the minimum care required to live. With the facilities grossly understaffed, care givers were sometimes outnumbered 30-1 or more by patients leading to neglect, starvation, abuse, abandonment, and every other horror one can imagine.

If you have never seen the stories behind these facilities you will be shocked that this took place in America. If you do not have a strong constitution you may have a hard time getting through the program but this is a story we cannot forget lest it happen again.",1402790400,8,1106,4.972972972972973

I am a Psychology teacher and this documentary runs 2, 35 minutes periods and is well worth it. They never forget it. Years after they graduate they still email me about it.

3507754,3,B001CC7PVM,"Having seen the first Willowbrook film back in the seventies I was very interested in what happened afterwards.  However, the film completely omitted the controversy of what happened after the first Willowbrook movie.  That film started the efforts to change laws so that the mentally ill and disabled were not 'warehoused' in institutions like Willowbrook.  Unfortunately we then went into the Reagan years where funding for other types of residential housing was dramatically cut.  This ushered in the age of doing absolutely the bare minimum for the mentally ill and disabled who did not have families to support them or who did not have the funds to be placed in residential settings or into better institutions.  This is why we have so many mentally ill and disabled adults living on the streets as homeless people to be victimized yet again.

3507770,4,B001CC7PVM,"I first learned of a place called the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island in the documentary Cropsey. Willowbrook was once the largest institution for the mentally disabled in the world. But unfortunately Willowbrook  was much more than that, it was a place where society's unwanted could be left and forgotten.

The tragedy that was Willowbrook first came to light in 1965 when Robert Kennedy called the institution a ""snake pit"" and nothing was done to correct the problems at it and other State run facilities for the handicapped. In 1972 Geraldo Rivera did an expose on the institution Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace for ABC news that exposed the worst of the problems: overcrowding, underfunding, nothing for the patients to do, lack of staff, rampant filth and disease. He compared the New York system with the much more progressive system in California which was moving away from the institutional setting to regional centers and group homes.

In 1982 Rivera revisited Willowbrook for the news show 20/20 to find that not much had really changed.  Willowbrook was forced to finally close its doors in 1987 after another wave of public outcry. Unforgotten  by Jack and Danny Fisher gives the viewer a glimpse of the changes that have occurred in our treatment of the mentally disabled in the years since Willowbrook closed. It is by turns a documentary of dispair but oddly one filled with hope. Things are getting better but not at the pace we could have hoped for. The film follows the journey of several families as they try to put there lives back together and rehabilitate the members of their families that had been placed in the institution.

This is an important film to watch for anyone interested in the gains that have been made in the care of the disabled. It provides a window into the lives that most of us don't see. It shows that everyone is important for society to function and it helps to redefine the concept of who is normal. It does all of this with great compassion.

The standard  definition DVD that I was provided includes the documentary which runs for about an hour amd the two Rivera exposes for ABC news. The news segments should be watched prior to the documentary to get a better appreciation of how things were and to give the viewer an example of how much things have changed.

3507773,4,B001CC7PVM,"This documentary is very good. Important for anyone who is direct care to see what it used to be like. I was disappointed that much of the original Geraldo Rivera documentary was not included. From the product details on the web page, I assumed the original was included, but only a few clips of it were. Definitely still worth the money.",1294790400,5,338,4.557377049180328
3507774,5,B001CC7PVM,"I remember when Willowbrook happened, so I was intrigued by such a follow-up video.  Let us never, ever, ever forget what happened when we pushed people to the side out of shame because they were disabled - different - than the rest of society!!!  I am very grateful that this film also shows ""so what happened to these residents AFTER Willowbrook was shut down?!""",1289865600,5,364,4.671875
3507775,2,B001CC7PVM,"But I really wanted to!!  I never had the emotional reaction that some other reviewers had - yes, it was interesting but it focused more on the families & not on the institution itself.",1267315200,2,185,4.4411764705882355
3507776,5,B001CC7PVM,"This was a great documentary.  It is a moving account of what it was like for the families of people placed in willowbrook.  Although it is sad, there is an uplifting part to this when you see the humanity and dignity that the families want for their loved ones.  It reminded me that sometimes all that we can do is the very best we can at that moment and when we can do better or when we know better, we can take bigger steps to our ideal.

The other thing I was reminded of was that each of us, regardless of our individual accomplishments and talents, is connected and has a purpose.  The spirit, soul, the light of these ""patients"" is there in the movie and you can feel the significance of their journey -- the impact on your own life.

I think this is a great movie.",1256860800,5,772,4.1824324324324325
3507777,5,B001CC7PVM,"This documentary about Willowbrook ""State School"" in Staten Island, New York really pushed my buttons. As a former social worker who specialized in working with the intellectually challenged population, I knew only too well that the conditions in many institutions were deplorable. I myself worked at a facility that was not exactly the best; and it certainly was a baptism by fire at best! This film, hosted by Danny Aiello, demonstrates that the people who were emotionally scarred by Willowbrook and similar facilities remain scarred many years after the closing of this ""school"" where roughly 80% of the residents were never given any education at all. The documentary moves at a good pace; at 57 minutes the run time is short but it certainly made me tear up a few times. This is mighty powerful stuff, to say the least. The archival footage we get is not the best quality; but I assume that they simply couldn't get the lighting that they would have liked. After all, the archival footage was filmed during Geraldo Rivera's unannounced visit to Willowbrook to expose the horrifying conditions there for his shocking news piece for a television news channel back in 1971.

In this film we meet several people who have a disabled person in their family; and they share with us moving, heartrending stories of the immense pain of parents and siblings who had to give up members of their families to facilities like Willowbrook because that was what all the ""experts"" would recommend at that time. Religious leaders, doctors and other family members would all encourage the parents of a developmentally disabled child to put the child into an institution and essentially leave them there. There were no group homes in regular residential communities. We even get one story of a man who actually went so far as to tell his family that the child was stillborn rather than let them know that the child was born with a disability and placed into Willowbrook! It's incredible.

We also learn that there was extremely insufficient funding from New York State to get the appropriate levels of staff into Willowbrook. This was an enormous, inhumane disgrace. Although the quality of care has greatly improved since the days of Willowbrook and similar institutions, staffing issues remain a problematic issue for most if not all social work agencies and group homes throughout the country. I never hear of a facility or a social work agency that has too many staff members!

Of course, I want to leave more of this for you so that you can have your own experience when watching this film. Although it may seem that I've given it all away, I didn't. You will see much more footage and the DVD also has as a bonus feature Geraldo Rivera's initial ""surprise"" expos report on Willowbrook filmed back in 1971. It's haunting.

Unforgotten: Twenty-Five Years After Willowbrook is a valuable learning tool for anyone studying the issues regarding persons who are intellectually challenged. Indeed, people going into any branch of health care should see this film; and if someone in your family has this type of disability you might want to add this to your DVD collection. I highly recommend this DVD.",1248393600,28,3186,4.905380333951762
3507778,5,B001CC7PVM,"I sobbed like a baby throughout the whole film, accompanied with a laugh here and there. Truly a film meant to see for those ignorant of the mentally challenged.

3507779,5,B001CC7PVM,"This documentary, while upsetting, is a must see for anyone learning about the history of disability and/or the deinstitutionalization movement in the U.S. Disturbing to know things like this ever happened, more disturbing to understand how recently these events occurred.",1245542400,5,272,5.825
3507780,5,B001CC7PVM,"This documentary was great, it gives a glimpse into the cruel reality of the mistreatment of the individuals that can't protect themselves. How our government works, the way our country locks away and forgets about the less fortunate population, we pay our garbage collectors more than we pay people to take care of and house the developmentally disabled.

Or was it just okay because these were mentally challenged children. you felt the pain of the parents and the family as they told the story but the documentary isn't complete but worth the watch this is our  AMERICA but how can we be shock for so many years African Americans have been poorly treated for so 100 of years that is the world we live in... sadly",1508371200,,489,4.556818181818182
8286568,3,B001CC7PVM,"This documentary is so-so. While it is important to not gloss over the personal experiences of the families' impacted by having a loved one in Willowbrook, the way the documentary is structured doesn't make for a very engaging or moving watch. The quality is not very good and the editing kind of just moves from one person to the other in interviews- in other words, I could tell that this wasn't a professional documentary. Still, it might be used as a 'suplement' for a larger documentary that is more comprehensive and cohesive. All in all not a 'bad' documentary, but not one I'd watch again.",1507334400,2,597,4.695238095238095
