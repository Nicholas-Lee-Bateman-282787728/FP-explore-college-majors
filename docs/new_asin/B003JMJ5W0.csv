4131110,5,B003JMJ5W0,"Although I do like English Dubbed, I won't complain for as long as I can understand the characters I shall be fine. I must say, the stories in Mirrors are a lot more in depth then in the first season. You actually learn a little more about Ai's three assistance and it revolves around a specific group and not just going all over the place with a different character in each episode. I found this anime to be worth my time although I do wish more was revealed in the first season.",1406592000,,480,4.228260869565218
4131111,5,B003JMJ5W0,I loved it because this time around the story was a lot more better its a must c n it inspired me to watch season 3 and this was just amazing,1392681600,,141,3.5806451612903225
4131112,3,B003JMJ5W0,"It was fine for the first few episodes, but when the subtitles disappeared I lost interest.

If I understood Japanese it wouldn't have mattered.

Due to this I returned this.",1387238400,,174,4.766666666666667
4131113,3,B003JMJ5W0,"The video discs were in good shape, but when we remove the plastic outer wrap the case was all smashed. I would try to return it just because of the case, but I've had such a difficult time with a missing shipment sent by another person I don't want to get into it. Besides, I don't have a printer and I don't have any friends who have printers. This item was a gift for one of my children.",1356652800,,390,4.012820512820513
4131114,5,B003JMJ5W0,"There is a certain site that appears only at midnight. If you enter a name and your hatred is strong enough, Hell Girl will appear and take revenge on that person for you by banishing them to hell. But curses always come home to roost - send someone to hell and that is where you will end up when you die.

The second season of Hell Girl is much like the first - only better. The first season relied on the tragedy to carry it forward. The stories were fairly straightforward, someone was wronged, revenge was taken, everyone lives happily ever after. The second season does this with a little more creativity. Things aren't always as they seem at first glance. There is also more emphasis on story then revenge. One episode shows Hone Onna and some friends she makes, at the end of the episode one of the friends is banished for a very trivial reason. It wasn't about the revenge so much as the strange story of a group of friends.
This season also shows the backgrounds of each of Ai's three helpers. The stories aren't very long, but they help to transform the three from cronies into characters.

Of the three seasons of Hell Girl, this one was my favorite (btw, third season isn't worth viewing). I enjoyed the revenges, the backstories, and was impressed with the ending. I definitely recommend it. Despite the crummy packaging.",1333929600,9,1334,4.577405857740586
4131115,3,B003JMJ5W0,"I cannot stand Sentai Filmworks, and it is very disappointing to know Funimation only has the rights to season 1. Funimation uses thinpacks or dvd cases that have multiple spaces in them... unlike this Sentai set in which it is a SPINDLE with four dvds stacked up. If I wanted a spindle, I could have just bought a package of blank dvds.

I have always been meaning to buy the second season, and Amazon had it on sale for 40 dollars RIGHT before release date - I found this much cheaper than buying the half sets and so now I have this instead. For 40 bucks, it is entirely worth it.. 63 dollars is a bit stupid considering how cheap the packaging is.

I assume Season 3's collection will have the same crappy spindle type dvd case... and I will only buy that when it is on sale.

Sentai Filmworks does not have a dubbed version of Hell Girl which does not bother me because I watch it with subtitles. I don't care much for dubs.",1323216000,4,929,4.267045454545454
4131116,3,B003JMJ5W0,considering how much you pay for 4 disks with no real extras (or an english dub) why the cheap spindle pack?????????,1322265600,8,116,4.571428571428571
4131117,3,B003JMJ5W0,"I was very dissapointed to find out the second season of Hell Girl wasn't licensed by Funimation and it isn't dubbed.
The second season story line has more twists to it than the first season. The episodes are not repetitive.
I LOVE the second season!
But there is no dub and it's quite expensive for the price of DVDs without dubs. It was poorly packaged, too. (4 DVDs stacked on top of each other...)",1321574400,10,401,4.4324324324324325
4131118,5,B003JMJ5W0,The overall thrill that came from this segment in the saga was the possibility. This added to the intensity and created an experience that is second to none.,1308528000,,157,4.642857142857143
4131119,4,B003JMJ5W0,"I've now seen every single Hell Girl DVD even Three Vessels and I can honestly say this is the best one of them all. Its story goes farther in its depictions, the things that happen frankly suprised me. And the amount of people willing to send someone to Hell for any reason is more clearly shown in this one.

The end is not disappointing, it was great. Even with the main character Ai showing her pain for the madness being involved, this is as I said the best one of all the Hell Girl DVDS out there now, period.",1299024000,,515,4.202020202020202

8398335,5,B003JMJ5W0,"I have seen the season before, but I wanted to buy The Two Mirrors Complete Collection.  I love the season, but there are no english subtitles.  Everything (the disk cover, the dvds) else was english, but not the language.  It didn't even give me the option for english.  Do not buy if you are looking for english subtitles.  The language is purely Japanese.  I am really sad that I can't understand or read the set.",1485302400,,416,4.48

8398340,5,B003JMJ5W0,IMO dubbing ruins anime I prefer a sub over horrible english voices that never fit the character. So this version of the series is perfect to me and to those of you that can't stand reading you need to go pick up a damned book for once instead of getting the story read to you.,1445212800,,277,4.054545454545455
8398341,3,B003JMJ5W0,The stars isn't for the series itself or Amazon. It's for the packaging. Spent almost 100$ for seasons 2 and 3 of Hell Girl for them to come in the bulky discs sit on top of each other cases. It would be okay had I not just paid more than I wanted for the rest of the Hell Girl series. Season 3 the more expensive one had scratches on disc 1 from it. Will be buying other cases for this series. Other than that pleased with my purchase.,1444348800,,436,3.965909090909091

8398343,4,B003JMJ5W0,"Second season of ""Hell Girl"" lacks some of the mystique of the first, due to our familiarity with the main story elements, but the graphics, animation and visual composition are just as appealing, as is the soundtrack.

Quality of the storyline of  the episodes varies (there are a few that are quite weak), but the stories are more complex and ambivalent than in the first season. As before, there is a strong message that might does not make right, and that individual conscience matters more than convention and prevailing opinion. There is no magical righting of wrongs - in one episode Ai says explicitly that she is not a champion of justice - but the entire series takes a sympathetic view of the weak, the excluded and the wronged. And as before, the stories do not shy away from uncomfortable topics: derangement, sadism, family dysfunction, sexual obsession, and incest.

Ai's three main companions play prominent roles in the unfolding of the stories. Second season is largely built around them, and they develop into compassionate, witty and likeable characters. They are supernatural figures from fairy tale, but they move around in the modern world in a natural and relaxed way, which is very charming.

Transition of the character of Ai to the second season is somewhat disappointing. It is clear at the end of the first season that Ai Enma is a tragic figure, victim of her community's folly and hounded by revulsion against her own fate: she was killed as an adolescent girl (shoujo) at the threshold of adult life. There are lyrical intimations of her approaching adulthood in the scenes immediately preceding her capture and death, contrasted by the most unsettling scene of the first season, her memorable ""danse macabre"" through the burning village.

Second season opens with a rather sentimentally preachy follow-up on that dance, in which Ai's fate is explained as punishment for her vengefulness. First season had built up the portrait of Ai as a persona frozen in time, her emotional unfolding arrested by the monstrous wrong that was done to her. Second season falls short of either developing or resolving that picture, as if the creation had outgrown the imagination of its creators, although the season's ending does give the character of Ai something of a meaningful closure after all.",1416182400,3,2315,5.002597402597402
