8720475,5,B00ZKNBW5O,A stunning and beautiful production.  Beautifully sung by chorus and principals.  I found it deeply moving!,1497571200,,107,5.625
8720476,1,B00ZKNBW5O,"This is truly an atrocious offering-so grotesque that I don't have the words to fully do justice to its failure.  Understand that this is not a ,masque by Purcell.  It is a concoction by Peter Sellars who simply strung together various offerings by Purcell into over 3 hours of insufferable nonsense.  I should have known, having witnessed Sellars, as a director,  thoroughly diminish some of Mozart's most glorious operas.  However,  having paid for it, I forced myself to view the whole thing.  It was three of the most painful hours that I have spent in recent memory and it took an awful lot of beer to get to the end.  At least the beer was thoroughly satisfying.",1492732800,3,668,4.64957264957265
8720477,5,B00ZKNBW5O,"Not for everyone.  People booed and walked out at the premier in Madrid.  Deals with the massacre of indigenous peoples by the Spanish in the 16th century.  But, a visual, audio masterpiece!  Brings together dance, chorale, opera, acting, sets, along with portions of various Purcell works intermixed with passages from La nina blanca y los pajaros sin pies by Nicaraguan novelist Rosario Aguilar.  Warning, the jacket claims running time of only 138 minutes.  It is actually over 3 hours long.  This is a good thing or bad thing depending upon how much you enjoy!  I personally found this to be one of the most creative, exciting productions I've seen on video.  I'll be be curious to hear from others who have the courage to purchase and view. At the current price of $14 it's a steal!",1481673600,3,787,4.727941176470588
8720478,5,B00ZKNBW5O,Wonderfully clear in sound. I would have appreciated a full libretto.,1461196800,2,69,5.363636363636363
