Park yong-ha as Kim shin against chae do-woo played by the incredible Kim kang-woo were two actors to be reckoned with. Amazing! Though both actors were amazing, it was Kim kang-woo who stole the show. He could go from a stone cold psychopath who was cool, calm and collected to a caring brother to his younger sister at the drop of a hat. Some of the best acting I've seen in a k drama. I loved it so much, I bought it. R.I.P park Yong ha",1433030400,,536,4.066037735849057
