7811477,5,6301374886,"Of the many excellent film documentaries of the art of Glenn Gould, this is my favorite. I've found it only in VHS format, it ought to be on DVD. Everything is here. Gould's sustaining family, his father, and especially his cousin  Jessie Griegg contribute filmed remembrances of Glenn, his youth in particular. Griegg's loving ideas are around every corner of this film, contributing to an estimable portrait of Gould's inner musical life. The film's scope is impressive, including some marvelous footage of his tempestuous character inventions in full costume, loads of ineffable piano playing, even a vigorous rehearsal with Menuhin of Schoenberg's Violin Concerto, accompanied by their wild conversation. Gould singing and conducting Bach to a field of attentive cows, and an expansive look at his radio documentaries (especially his 'Idea of North') are indispensable!  Highest recommendation amid a sea of worthy Gould video. Watch this film, your love will increase.",1123977600,12,973,5.437086092715232
