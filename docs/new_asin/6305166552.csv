effects and fancy things to achive a good film. Emotion, good
scenario and a lot of personal feeling. A classic for all times.
Some movies of the french and german cinema (1910-1935) have to be the standards for people who are involved with cinema.
Les Vampires is one of them.
Sometimes the acting in the episodes is a bit naiv but this is normal for that era.
The people who like cinema must own this work.",1018483200,2,469,4.402298850574713
981584,4,6305166552,"love the films and great to see them restored so well, am very happy with this purchase except... in one episode the picture broke up slightly 3 times into the blocky terror of all DVD owners (the Hotspot was one film where and entire chapter went gaga). it wasn't large, so don't let it put you off, a brief flicker, but it destroys the illusion of DVD being the ultimate format...Great dvd, buy it...",1014854400,3,402,4.445945945945946

The picture quality was a little below what I am used to, but keeping into account this film was made in 1915, that can be excused.  Full of mystery, suspense, comedy and action, this film is packed full of everything you could ask for in a silent movie.  I encourage you to buy it!",1000080000,2,404,4.153846153846154
981586,5,6305166552,"This is a treat indeed! Not reviewing the film (which is really good) I would like to discuss the technical data. The transfer is quite good, although not the best possible (i.e. the special features - two ultrashorties - are of amazingly good quality), but this is in no way the fault of the producers of this DVD. The picture is gently toned in sepia, green or blue thus assisting the scene. The new soundtrack is really superb: a small concert orchestra (possibly a septet) plays typical silent film horror music, with sometimes the popular tunes of the period melted in effortlessly. I have sometimes used this DVD simply for the purposes of music! The included booklet is very useful as well. All in all - you are unlikely to find a better silent movie, transferred in correct speed, with great score, very sensible actors, and good quality. Not to mention the MOOD...! My only complaint is that all the old French texts have been dropped and have been replaced with still image texts in English, but that really is not important.

981587,5,6305166552,"The first thing to note about this film is that it is not about vampires, at least not in the traditional (bloodsucking, garlic, crosses) sense of that word. Instead, we have a glorious series of tales about a criminal gang and the attempts of a reporter and his sidekick to catch up with them. The viewer may sympathise with these attempts, but it is hard not to chear on Irma Vep and her 'vampire' colleagues. She is one of the great silent characters and everyone in the film, as well as the viewer, may be said to be half in love with her, half afraid of her. This film, or series of films, is very long, but it draws the viewer in, especially if viewed over a few successive days. Eventually one feels almost a part of the film's world. This world it should be remembered is the world of 1915-16, the first world war is raging nearby. It is quite staggering to think that a film like this could be made under these circumstances. This DVD is very well produced. The picture is almost invariably clear and there is no jerkiness in the movements of the actors. The tinting is subtle and adds to the mood of the scenes. The music has a series of recurrent themes which one begins to recognize and welcome as they reappear. The added bonus of two short features, featuring actors from the film, serves mainly to emphasise the production's wartime origins. One is for the relief of war orphans, the other an exhortation to serve France at the front. This film is not at all well known. It is to be hoped that this fine DVD can give it some lasting fame all these years later.",980121600,13,1575,4.378839590443686
981588,5,6305166552,"What we know about visual style in regards to French cinema is that images can be stamped into the mind in many different ways--ways American directors wish to copy even today.

There line of silent films on blu-ray is amazing and utterly flooring at the art form and craftmanship they put into there products. Les Vampires is one of those forgotten about serial films. This is the film to own for it's old school mastery at telling a cliffhanger story. Perfection in performing and leaving you ready for more. The special features are awesome and the transfer of this film is mastery at it finest. Never has this film been such clarity. They honored this film. KINO tends to always create mastery. Highly recommend for the quality given to this transfer and to the reality of this being lost by time. Les Vampires is a film that goes up there with silent perfection. It's different and it's unique and is something that stands out. I absolutely loved this and KINO's transfer of this film is amazing. www.abucketofcorn.com,1427673600,4,895,4.780645161290322

981933,5,6305166552,"This review is of the Kino Blu-ray edition.

This two disc set contains ten films varying in length from 15 to 60 minutes. Each story is complete within itself (no cliffhangers), yet part of an overall story arc. ""Les Vampires"" refers to a gang of criminals terrorizing Paris of 1915. There are rival gangs and gang leaders vying for supremacy. The nominal head of the vampires is a woman named Irma Vep -- an anagram of vampire. An investigative reporter tries to track down the gang, providing the overall story arc. Comedy relief is provided by the reporter's sidekick, a reformed Vampire, who often muggs into the camera. There are kidnappings, bombings, poison gas attacks, assassinations of police officials -- you name it, the Vampires are up for it! This is a silent film with musical accompaniment, and occasional off-screen sound effects (door bells, telephones).
Image quality: The image is clear and sharp, though a little contrasty. The film has not been cleaned up, so there are numerous scratches, specks and white spots. In short, it looks like a 100-year old film, so don't expect perfection. Night scenes are tinted blue, but there was no other tinting. Tinting was common in silent films of the era, with a whole range of colors used to suggest different times of day and lighting conditions, but only night scenes were tinted in this film.
Silent films told their stories visually, with only occasional intertitles where an explanation was necessary. The Kino discs have English intertitles, and translations of on-screen letters and notes.
Highly recommended.",1414540800,3,1580,5.053639846743295

981935,5,6305166552,"So says Oscar Mazamette, one of the three principal characters in Louis Feuillade's LES VAMPIRES and it sums up the plot concisely but hardly scratches the surface of the complexity of this legendary 10 episode serial. Feuillade (pronouced Foo-YAHD) had succeeded Alice Guy (rhymes with KEY) in 1907 as the production head of France's Gaumont Studios and produced and/or directed over 700 films between 1906 and 1924 (most were one or two reelers). His first large scale serial about the master criminal FANTOMAS (1913-1914) was an international success and helped to pave the way for LES VAMPIRES (1915-1916) which would be an even bigger success and would have a major influence not only on the crime drama as a genre but on many future filmmakers. It also introduced actress-dancer Musidora as Irma Vep, a black clad, dark-eyed anti-heroine (see cover) who would become one of the icons of early cinema. He would follow LES VAMPIRES with JUDEX (1916-1917) about a mysterious figure fighting for justice which gave Musidora another great villainess to play, that of Diana Monti. It too would be very successful (even spawning a sequel) and was remade by director Georges Franju (EYES WITHOUT A FACE) in 1963.

The deceptively simple plotline of LES VAMPIRES has crime reporter Phillipe Guerande (Edouard Mathe') taking on a vast criminal organization known as ""the Vampires"" (sorry, no bloodsuckers here) with the aid of trusty, comical sidekick Mazamette (Marcel Levesque). Even though each of the 10 chapters is complete (no cliffhangers like in American serials), they are a rollercoaster ride of alternate identities, narrow escapes, and daring and dastardly deeds. What makes LES VAMPIRES work is Feuillade's use of Paris locations (ca 1915) and how restrained his performers are. The plot twists are varied and the characters are engaging and intruiging. Imagine watching a 100 year old version of HOUSE OF CARDS. The Blu-Ray release is basically the same as the old Waterbearer Films DVD although digitally remastered. The Mont Alto Orchestra score suits the material well although it's occasionally repetitive. To be fair I did watch all 7 hours with only one break (to change discs). If you've never experienced a Feuillade serial before then this is the one to start with. Some sections are in better shape than others but for being 100 years old, it looks remarkable. Try it and see. Betcha can't stop at just one episode!",1393804800,3,2435,5.102756892230577
981936,5,6305166552,"I bought this simply on a whim-and was greatly rewarded. Silent classic series of a group of thieves, murderers, and just generally evil-doers on the take-led by Irma Vep...not truly vampires in the sense thought of in current vernacular-but vampires living off of society and it's riches during the time period...I have to be honest and say I even laughed aloud at some of the exploits and lengths she and her group of little criminals went to secure the loot they were after!  Very highly enjoyable for anyone with a curiosity where ""crime-dramas"" got their start-or anyone who just has a fond appreciation for silent cinema in general. Blu-ray quality was impressive for age.  Jeff recommends this!",1383609600,,701,4.982905982905983
981937,1,6305166552,"Kino has really dropped the ball on this one; after some really awesome Blu-ray releases of properly and heroically truly restored classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Metropolis-Blu-ray/dp/B0040QYROK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-General-Blu-ray/dp/B002NTDX6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The General [Blu-ray</a>] and especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battleship-Potemkin-Blu-ray/dp/B0036SPDEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battleship Potemkin [Blu-ray</a>] where some major effort was made to remove all the usual imperfections of old film like the white and black circles on the top right hand corner of the frames, the white and black spots, the scratches etc and done so mostly very well we get now get this big disappointment of an alleged ""restoration"" of what is otherwise a worthy classic deserving of its place in the hall of fame of all-time great movies.

If you are a fan of all the ways an old film can be imperfect by all means get this blu-ray where every possible picture frame imperfection due to age and poor preservation can cause is showcased.  If any attempt was made to truly restore this film in the way that Kino did before with all the great films I mentioned earlier then whoever it is who is responsible should be fired given how little was accomplished!  Perhaps when they meant ""restored"" they meant in the sense that it was finally put together in its uncensored original form which is very misleading as anyone who bought Kino's Metropolis and Battleship Potemkin would have received both a full restoration of the uncensored version as best as possible PLUS at least an attempt at removing as much of the picture imperfections as is humanly possible.  When compared to what Kino is capable of doing in truly restoring classic films this is a very massive let down and now makes me think that we can only truly entrust the proper restoration of old classic films to their rivals Criterion who consistently churn out very well properly restored classic films.

Fans expecting standards of restoration that Kino accomplished with Battleship Potemkin, The General or Metropolis will be very, very, very disappointed with this release and my advice would be to save your hard earned money on a better release in the future.  If you are going to have to deal with this extremely poor picture quality from a very badly preserved original source without any attempt made at proper restoration then you are better off getting the much cheaper dvd or VHS as watching this on blu-ray makes no difference at all.  Instead I feel totally mislead and ripped-off by Kino.  It's going to take a long while before I trust any future Kino release now which is a shame given how great the other three films I mentioned above were; all it takes is just one exception to make me very reluctant to part with my hard earned money for ""quality"" like this.

Very disappointing release from Kino who are capable of much better quality work.

Very, very much NOT recommended!",1357430400,9,3212,5.604123711340206
981938,5,6305166552,"During the silent era, a popular way for writers to showcase a long storyline was through movie serials.  Known as ""Chapter Plays"", these serials were often screened at theaters weekly or monthly.  And in the United States, viewers followed the adventures of Pearl White in serials such as ""The Perils of Pauline"" or adventurer Elaine in ""The Exploits of Elaine"".

Meanwhile in Europe, A french filmmaker would be known for his serial work.  Back in 1905, Louis Feuillade would work as a screenwriter for Gaumont and worked under artistic director Alice Guy-Blache.  Impressed by his work, Alice would give Louis the chance to learn to direct films by himself.  When Guy-Blache and her husband moved to America to start their own film studio, The Solax Studio, in New Jersey, she recommended Feuillade as her replacement at Gaumont.

Sure enough, this would lead to him to create his first five-episode serial in 1913-1914 titled ""Fantomas"".  Now considered as a masterpiece, Feuillade would go on to work on another serial titled ""Les Vampires"" (The Vampires"" in 1915-1916) followed by ""Judex"" in 1916 and many more.

But with ""Les Vampires"", the serial was his most revered.  Looked at as an early thriller which would inspire the crime thriller genre and would be one of the earliest examples of a gangster film.  A serial which inspired Alfred Hitchcock, Luis Bunuel, Frits Lang and many others, despite the fact that the serial was not popular because it was done in pulp fashion and criticized for not being stylish and not high quality (the serial was written quickly, inexpensively with very little written script), Luis Feuillade stayed true to himself and would not let critics deter him.

And now, the 10-episode serial is considered a masterpiece.

For a film that was criticized for lack of style, as many historians look back at this film, not only was the  French marketing intriguing, it also would be known for making actress Musidora one of the most popular vamp actresses since Theda Bara for her role as Irma Vep.  And its legacy has led ""Les Vampires"" of being listed as one of the top films of all time.  The film was voted #30 in Sight and Sound magazine's ""Critics Top 10 Poll"" at #30, #78 in The Village voice's ""50 Best Films of the 20th Century"".

And now ""Les Vampires"" was released in the U.S. on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber featuring  a new restoration by the Cin&eacute;math&egrave;que Franaise and musical score compiled and performed by The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra.

Before I begin my review, ""Les Vampires"" (The Vampires) is not a horror film about vampires but the name of a gang.  In France, gangs known as Apaches (which was attributed by Europeans to the Native American Tribes) for their savagery.  The gangs would pursue prospects from the bourgeois middle class and with a specialized weapon (which was a gun, knife and brass knuckle all-in-one), kill and also rob people.  While these gangs were seen as ruffians, in ""Les Vampires"", the gang is more of a criminal organization with a leader that manages to infiltrate areas where the wealthy may be socializing or living.

The serial would focus on a man named Philipe Guerande (portrayed by Edouard Mathe), a reporter working for a newspaper known as ""The Paris Chronicle"" and has been investigating a criminal organization known as the Vampires.  Often, he gets into conflicts with a co-worker named Mazamette (portrayed by Marcel Levesque) who is trying to derail Philipe's investigation.  But he is caught by Philipe and the investigator learns that Mazamette has been threatened to lose his family, so feeling bad for Mazamette, Philippe gives him a second chance.  And because of that, Mazamette becomes not of an assistant, but a character that gets involved in situations but yet manages to help Philipe during his time of need.

""Les Vampires Episode 1 - The Severed Head"" is an introduction to our primary characters.  Philipe is investigating the Vampires and receives a telegram that a decapitated body of a national security agent in charge of the Vampire Organization, Inspector Durtal has been found.  His head is missing.  Meanwhile, Philipe who goes to investigate this, stays with his father's old friend Dr. Nox (portrayed by Jean Ayme).  Visiting Dr. Nox is Mrs. Simpson (portrayed by Rita Herlor), an American multimillionaire who loves her jewels.  But what happens when Mrs. Simpson's money and jewels are stolen and Philipe has been framed for the crime?

""Les Vampires Episodes 2 - The Deadly Ring"" features Philipe attending a ballet featuring, ballerina Marfa Koutilof (portrayed by Stacia Napierkowska).  With the gang wanting to deter Philipe from working on his investigation, the Grand Vampire has slipped poison in the ring of Marfa and when she puts it on, she dies on stage.  Philipe meanwhile recognizes the Grand Vampire as the person who imitated Dr. Nox and goes after him.  But Philipe is caught in the process and now is going to be executed.  But disguised as one of the gang members is Mazamette.

""Les Vampires Episode 3: The Red Cryptogram"" features Philipe trying to decipher a red booklet that he found on the body of the Grand Iquisitor, which details the crimes of the Vampires.  This leads him to a night club where Irma Vep (portrayed by Musidora) is performing.  Philipe recognizes that her name is an anagram for the word vampire and the Grand Vampire has Irma Vep on mission to take back the red booklet that is in Philipe's possession.  Meanwhile, Philipe's mother is kidnapped by the Vampires.

""Les Vampires Episode 4: The Spectre"" features the Grand Vampire now pretending to be a real estate broker doing business with Juan-Jose Moreno (portrayed by Fernand Hermann), who is looking for an apartment with a safe.  Moreno doesn't know that the safe has a secret door in the back that Irma Vep and the Grand Vampire can access, thus stealing whatever Moreno can keep inside the safe.  Meanwhile, Philipe in disguise is on to Irma who is pretending to be a bank secretary at a location where a man named Mr. Metadier has gone missing.

""Les Vampires Episode 5: The Corpse's Escape"" features the magistrate (from episode 1) being assigned the Vampire case and the Moreno case.  When Moreno is to meet with the magistrate, he fakes his death with a cyanide capsule.  Thinkng that Moreno is dead, when the night-watchman checks on him, it's a ruse and Moreno steals his clothes and escapes prison. Meanwhile, Philipe is once again kidnapped by the Vampires.

""Les Vampires Episode 6: The Eyes that Mesmerize""features Moreno looking for the Vampires.  Meanwhile, Philipe and Mazamette go to watch a film which shocks them because Irma Vep and the Grand Vampire are in it.  Meanwhile, the Grand Vampire and Irma Vep have their eyes on an American tourist named Horatio Werner.  When they learn that an American millionaire was robbed of $200,000 and there is a reward who can capture the criminal, the two feel that Werner is the American millionaire that was robbed.  Meanwhile, Moreno arrives and intends to use his hypnotic power on Irma Vep.

""Les Vampires Episode 7: Satanas"" features Moreno now in control as he used his power to have the Grand Vampire killed.  Or did he?  It appears that the real Grand Vampire has been revealed to be a man known as Satanus.  And in his first coming out to show his power, Satanas sends a warning to Philipe that he will be destroying ""The Happy Shack"".  We are introduced to Moreno's accomplice named Lily Flower.

""Les Vampires Episode 8: The Lord of Thunder"" features Irma now being sentences to life in prison at St. Lazarus prison.  As she leaves by ship to Algeria, Satanus blows up the vessel.  Is Irma dead? We are introduced to Mazamette's son Eustache (portrayed by Rene Poyen) and we see a major confrontation between Philipe and Satanus.  Meanwhile, we are introduced to a new Vampire who wants the leadership position...Venomous (portrayed by Frederik Moris).

""Les Vampires Episode 9: The Poison Man"" features a new leader, Venomous.  With Irma Vep alive and well, she works with Venomous to finally get rid of Philipe and Mazamette.  Meanwhile, Venomous learns that Philipe is engaged to a woman named Jane Bremontier (portrayed by Louise Lagrange) and the two will be having an engagement party.  The Vampires plan to crash the party.

""Les Vampires Episode 10: The Bloody Wedding"" features the final confrontation as Philipe and Mazamette plan to stop the Vampires one last time.  But can they?  Meanwhile, as Philipe has married Jane, Mazamette falls for Augustine Charlet (portrayed by Germaine Rouer).

VIDEO:

""Les Vampires"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio), black and white.  Featuring a restoration from 1996 courtesy of Cin&eacute;math&egrave;que Franaise, as one can expect from a film that is nearly a 100-years-old, it's not going to be pristine.  You're going to see dust, scratches and the sprocket holes (which is not a bad thing because you get the whole image instead of it being cropped).

Another difference compared to the Image Entertainment DVD is that the handwritten letters were featured with text on black, but for Kino's version Blu-ray, this time the entire letter is featured with subtitles on the bottom. Because the Image DVD is older and thus watching it looks a bit blurry, the picture quality and clarity for the HD version on Blu-ray is much more detailed and clearer to see.  Sure, some scenes that are high in contrast may get a bit too white, but the Blu-ray if compared to the older DVD is  quite significant in some ways.  If anything, fans of the film will definitely want to upgrade from the previous DVD version because frankly, the clarity of the image is much better.

It's not perfect, but it's the definitive version of ""Les Vampires"" to own at this time!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Les Vampires"" does not use the Robert Israel score, this time Kino goes with Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra and presents their wonderful music in uncompressed Linear PCM 2.0.  The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra version is crystal clear and compliments the storyline very well.  It would have been nice to have Robert Israel's score to be added as a secondary choice for those who prefer it.  But for the most part, I'm quite pleased with the newer Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra score.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Les Vampires"" comes with a trailer for Kino's previous DVD release of Louis Feuillade's ""Fantomas"".

EXTRAS:

""Les Vampires"" comes with a slipcase.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a silent film fan, one of the things that I love about Kino and its contribution to silent cinema is that they have released continually released silent films that are entertaining but also released collection of shorts that are historic and quite informative for those wanting to learn about the earlier years of cinema.

From Kino's release of the Avante-garde DVD sets, the Melies set, the Edison set or even Gaumont sets, the company have provided films that many have dreamed of being released on video.

For those who follow silent serial's, Kino has released Louis Feuillade's ""Fantomas"" on DVD and now is releasing ""Les Vampires"" in HD.

""Les Vampires"" is a release that is not only entertaining but also fits into the context of cinematic firsts.  Not only was it one of the longest serial films at the time but it was also instrumental of being one of the earliest form of gangster films and ""Les Vampire"" is credited for being one of the first thriller films.

Sure, ""Les Vampires"" may not have received much love for audiences at the time nor was it a big budget film that was going to compare to similarly released films in America by D.W. Griffith.  If anything, Louis Feullade focused on creating a serial with what he had.  From re-using furniture to having actors who were on leave to the war, needless to say, he had the challenge of releasing films quickly, so audiences would have a new film each month to watch.

For silent film fans of today, sure D.W. Griffith was very much about creating expensive films with elaborate sets and many extras, but ""Les Vampire"" was like watching a fascinating indie production but despite it's low budget and constricted time schedule, we are able to follow this crime drama.

We are able to be watch and see why Irma Vep has become somewhat of a vampy iconic character, even going so far to have a 1996 film by Olivier Assayas based and paying homage to her character.  As Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" had an android character that will be remembered for its look, ""Les Vampires"" will also have a memorable character as Irma Vep, an antagonist sporting a skintight black outfit.  The film's symbol of danger and sexiness but also a hint of darkness that we see played out in many superhero films and comic books with antagonists dolled up in skin tight outfits.  Suffice to say, in terms of vamps, I've always felt the character of Irma Vep was very cool to watch.  For its darkness and quite simply, those eye-piercing stares that Musidora gives in a scene.  Personally, in terms of vamps, I would watch Musidora over Theda Bara any day.

As for the Blu-ray, this is the definitive version of ""Les Vampires"" to own at this time.  The clarity of this Blu-ray release is much better than its Image DVD counterpart but once again, I emphasize that these serials are not pristine.  Sometimes it's hard to explain to people just watching silent films on Blu-ray that not everything is going to look as great as ""Metropolis"" or Buster Keaton's ""The General"".  This film is not pristine but the fact that you are getting the complete ten episode run and that the damage to the original source are pretty much scratches, dust and occasional sprocket holes showing up, are not so bad.  It makes ""Les Vampires"" quite appealing to own on Blu-ray!  One can only hope that now Kino considers releasing ""Fantomas"" on Blu-ray and also pursues the release of ""Judex"" to Blu-ray as well.

There are a few things that I wish Kino could have done for the Blu-ray release and that is give people the option to choose between the new Mont Alto Picture Orchestra's score and the older Robert Israel score. And as for the special features, the European Artificial Eye DVD release came with a Louis Feuillade documentary and even included four of his short films.  It would have been nice to have more special features included on this Blu-ray release.

""Les Vampires"" is one of those must-own releases for silent film fans.  It's also a serial that you want to watch over time and not try to watch it in a single setting.  Not only does the film have its importance in cinema history but it's also a pretty entertaining release from Kino.  I loved the mystery and suspense of the film but if I had to pick something that I didn't like, then it would be the hypnotic power that the character Moreno seems to have later on, especially the character of Satanus.  The film starts to go from real situations but then starting to include a more supernatural side to it that could be a little kitsch at times.

But I value ""Les Vampires"" as a release that finds a balance of being a release purely as of entertaining and also historical value.  The fact is you are getting 6.5 hours worth on Blu-ray and it may not have many special features but for it's improved transfer on Blu-ray and how great these serials look in HD compared to the last DVD and the fact that they are nearly 100-years-old is incredible.

And the fact that you get ten episodes on Blu-ray for an incredible price, makes ""Les Vampires"" worth owning!

Overall, ""Les Vampires"" is simply a Blu-ray release that silent film fans will want to own for their collection.  You'll be entertained by its storyline and characters but you also know that you are owning one of the longest films made for its time but also a collection of serials that can be seen as one of the early gangster and thriller films before the genre was created and defined.

A classic masterpiece by Louis Feuillade, ""Les Vampires"" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!",1354320000,11,16080,4.829072315558802
981939,5,6305166552,"To clear up some questions about this new Kino HD Blu-ray release: it IS a NEW HD transfer mastered from the 35mm film restoration made in 1996 by Gaumont Studios.
The film source is the same as the older Image DVD as the original restoration was properly done on film. No new film elements have been found since that release.
This High Definition transfer to video is a NEW HD transfer of that 35mm film which will bring more picture detail than the old Image DVD Standard Definition transfer.

Picture sharpness has been improved, details are more apparent. The running time is different from the old DVD due to a change in film speed. The Kino transfer runs slower than the old Image release. Either film speed is acceptable, but the slower film speed seems more suitable for dramas.  It would be too slow for a silent comedy.
While some additional image restoration seems to have been done, there are still white specks & lines. While Kino gives you a sharp image with the best contrast and occasional image stabilization, Kino tends to avoid extensive 'restoration' work, allowing the wear in the original film elements to remain. Some feel short-changed by this while purists want to see the original films unaltered as they exist today. I do prefer to see the films as their creators originally wanted, but DNR tends to remove true image details as well as the film scratches. Given that side-effect I will take the scratches in order to keep the original details. Hand-painting out the scratches could be done, but it is very time consuming and expensive. Maybe later in the future when 4-K resolution home video comes out (the TVs are already being produced).

Missing from this new Kino release are the brief bonus clips in the original Image DVD release:
Insert Essay, ""The Public Is My Master: Louis Feuillade and Les Vampires"" by Fabrice Zagury
""For the Children"" (1916), a three-minute comedy sketch by the cast and crew of Les Vampires to raise funds for the French war orphans
""Bout de Zan and the Shirker""(1916), an eight-minute comedy that features the child actor Bout de Zan from Episode 8 of Les Vampires and is directed by Louis Feuillade.

982204,5,6305166552,"Director Louis Feuillade's LES VAMPIRES is not just one of the all-time great serials, it is one of the greatest examples of cinema in general from the World War 1 period. It has a sophistication both in terms of narrative and acting style that even exceeds many celebrated American films of the same era.

The 10 part serial follows the exploits of a criminal organization known as the Vampires who spread fear and mayhem throughout Paris by killing, looting, and kidnapping. Plucky journalist Phillipe Guerande and his sidekick Mazamette set out on a crusade to rid the city of this evil threat.

LES VAMPIRES is a truly enjoyable viewing experience on many levels. It was shot in and around Paris during 1915-16 and the war torn, abandoned locations Feuillade chose for backgrounds add immeasurably to the heightened realism and chilling, doom-filled atmosphere of the film. Because of where and when it was made, it is a valuable, fascinating historical and cultural record preserved on film. It also has all the ingredients of the best serials: black-hooded villains, car chases, cryptograms, daring escapes, sweet-smelling poison gas... and topping it all off is beautiful French actress Musidora as the seductive Irma Vep ( an anagram of ""vampire"" ), strategist of the criminal gang and the mistress of their leader who is known as the Grand Vampire. But where American serials of the time used predictable plotlines, LES VAMPIRES takes unexpected twists and turns so that it evokes the feeling that anything and everything might happen. The film was hugely popular and it became the forerunner of the mystery/crime thriller genre, inspiring such great filmmakers as Fritz Lang and Luis Bunel.

Although widely available, the 1998 English version from Image Entertainment is not the best there is on this film. If you have a multi-region player I STRONGLY recommend the 2006 French language DVD edition from Gaumont Video. Granted, the intertitles are in French, but the print quality is far superior - your jaw will drop, it is that good. Keep the English version if you feel you need the translation, but once you've watched the film a few times it's easy to follow regardless of the language. Or, you can always learn to read French. The bottom line is, for a film as great as this one, nothing but the best quality available will suffice.*

LES VAMPIRES was almost lost until - amazingly - a print was found before it would have been literally carried away as garbage! The decomposing nitrate was stored in film cans and had no beginning/end titles or intertitles, making it virtually impossible to recognize what it was. Hence, the cans were put atop a dumpster to be hauled off. Fortunately, it was discovered in time and LES VAMPIRES was saved from oblivion so that we can savor it today, fully restored, its power to thrill and captivate intact and undiminished.

I am very fond of the early great Black and White silent films including Wings, Metropolis, Birth of a Nation and Napoleon among many others. I was greatly surprised with this saga of ten progressive chapters. The movie was made in 1915 and yes, there are repeating pieces of furniture seen between the different sets, and the night scenes are clearly shot during daylight. However, the movie is powerful and not as forcefully acted like many of the ""big"" early Hollywood movies. It gives you an eerie sense of reality because the actors are truly good and the cinematography captures a vivid and realistic picture of the turn-of-the-20th century France.
I am now a big fan of this movie, and I would amply recommend it to all audiences. Musidora was indeed a captivating star and one of the greatest silent film actresses.",1205884800,,886,4.72258064516129
982207,5,6305166552,"""Les Vampires"" (1915 - 398 minutes - B&W) is a classic of the mute cinema series directed by Louis Feuillade. In ten episodes, it counts the adventures of a masked assailants group who haunt Paris. The mythical actress Musidora [ the first ""Vamp"" of the European cinema ] is the star in the series, that achieved fame due to the great admiration among the surrealists (Andres Breton and Luis Buuel were its bigger fans), seduced by the dreamily scenes that sometimes appears in the narrative. At first ""Les Vampires"" was rejected for the French vanguard directors, that considered it like a mere policeman series.

The film was saved from destruction thanks to the efforts of the founder of the French Film library, Henri Langlois, and after years forgotten, ""Les Vampires"" was exhibited again in the sixties, in concurred sessions that had marked time, especially in Paris, London and New York, causing a reevaluation of the critics relatively to the work of Feuillade. Andres Bazin, the great critic of the French cinema, said that ""Les Vampires"" was ""one of the biggest film of all the times"", admiration shared with the directors of the new French cinema. Today, Feuillade is placed side by side to other geniuses of the mute period of the cinema, as Griffith, Stroheim, Murnau and Gance. The episodes: 1: The Cut Head (31 minutes); 2: The Ring that Kills (13 minutes); 3: The Red Book (39 minutes); 4: The Specter (30 minutes); 5: The Escape of the Dead Man (35 minutes); 6: Hypnotic eyes (53 minutes); 7: Satanus (42 minutes); 8: The Master of the Thunder (50 minutes); 9: The Poisoner (48 minutes); 10: The Terrible Marriage (57 minutes).",1110585600,7,1645,4.854092526690391

982210,5,6305166552,"OK, this DVD is a bit expensive; nor is it admittedly for everyone, but for those who are willing to take a risk will find that great cinema dates much earlier than they ever thought.
It is said of director Louis Feuillade, that this work is the first film of the silent era that doesn't require putting into a historic framework and I agree. At times this film will shock you in how ""contemporary"" it feels.
The DVD is a decent quality transfer in 1.33:1 standard screen. The episodes are tinted (yellow for interiors, blue for night scenes, red for love scenes, etc.). I recommend setting your DVD player to black & white for the best picture. The score is a mostly piano soundtrack reminicent of Chopin, which was recorded recently, but is remarkably fitting. The title cards are in present-day English.
This film is a ten-part crime series spanning a total of over 7 hours. Each episode runs approximately 40 minutes or so. The style is slightly comedic, full of espionage, and alot of fun, not very unlike watching a Bond movie today, minus the sexuality. My advice, buy this DVD and set aside a week to watch an episode or two a night. It truly is one of the supreme pleasures of film.",1019347200,22,1191,4.544186046511628

She is the perfect villainess, who murders, plants bombs and breaks into peoples homes and steals their stuff. Oscar Mazamette, played by Marcel Lvesque, brings an element of fun to the story and occasionally breaks the ""Forth Wall"" and plays to the audience.  The story is complicated and has a few twists and turns. I really enjoyed watching all 10 parts.  Watching a silent film takes getting used too.

7884697,3,6305166552,"""Les Vampires"" (1915-1916) is directed by Louis Feuillade (Fantomas). This is a 417 minute long silent crime serial film that is broken up into 10 episodes of varying length. The Vampires are a criminal organization, and have nothing to do with the supernatural type of vampire. The soundtrack was added on after the fact and it's okay, but it seems to have no relationship with the movie and it comes across as rather uninspired and monotonous after a while. This film influenced the surrealists and various directors, such as Luis Bunuel and Alfred Hitchcock, and is considered important in the history of cinema.

This two disc set was apparently restored by Cinematheque Francaise, but only the title cards are actually clean looking. The rest of the picture has numerous instances of dust and other anomalies. This set is the tinted version, which is nice to see, however, this is a barebones set. There is no audio commentary, or special features of any kind. I would highly recommend Feuillade's earlier series, ""Fantomas""(1914-1914), as it is now on blu-ray and it looks stunning, as it has been beautifully restored.",1456963200,6,1125,5.016042780748663

The plot is labyrinthine, unravels in places, takes forever to make progress, and is poorly acted (don't even get me started on the supposed sex appeal of Irma Vep. She looks like a very ordinary woman from the 1910's as far as I am concerned).
