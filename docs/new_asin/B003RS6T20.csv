8403861,4,B003RS6T20,"Saw this film back in the early 1980's in my Italian class and really enjoyed it. I've been looking for it on DVD for years. Not to give too much away, but the main character keeps trying to figure out if the prostitute is his wife, so he runs from one place back home to try to beat his wife to see if it really is her. They can't be in two places at the same time, can they? But each time, his wife is already at the house, so she CAN'T be the prostitute who looks just like her. Only he keeps finding new shortcuts that would let her beat him home, so he still can just never say for sure if it's her. The conclusion during Carnevale when everyone is disguised adds a comment on what we keep hidden vs what we show others. Worth watching if you get a chance.",1497571200,,761,3.980392156862745
