8062153,4,B0009K3I9G,"I used this in my Arabic class, and it seems as though my students were interested. this is a documentary made up mostly of many clips of Iraqis apparently answering questions or giving opinions. There is a pretty good variety between average people from the street to more specific interviews such as professors, poets, victims of well-known torture events and so forth. The clips were all made very soon after the operation started, so now, a number of years later, we have perhaps a different perspective. Other reviews have pointed out the many different opinions and impressions Iraqis display in this video. What's key for me is that what eventually comes out is fatigue from many years of hardship, war, and stress. A common theme is that Iraqis want stability and are concerned, if not outright upset about chaos and a lack of progress, even at these early stages. As history begins to look at the action in Iraq, I think the judgement will be that the US failed to understand what it would take to provide the kind of stability needed for progress. Getting rid of Saddam was great, but Iraqis were not as willing or able to step up and create viable institutions and they were not consistently provided by the US forces either. This left a lot of people floundering and succeptible to crime and a lack of opportunities and services. I am also a Spanish teacher, and I see themes in this documentary that are common in many Spanish societies that also saw the overthrow of dictators. Most of the population is glad the dictator is gone, and many are willing to speak out about atrocities, but the circumstances that replaced the dictator are often problematic also. It's not that Iraqis would want to go back to Saddam, but they expected more once he was gone.",1238198400,,1768,4.7064516129032254
8062154,5,B0009K3I9G,"I added this documentary to my curriculum I have been using to teach MSA and Iraqi Dialect, and it's been a success.  My students are adult high level of Arabic language and they are very enthusiastic about learning the real life situation instead of what newspapers are providing.  Besides it is an authentic material, it helps us here in the US understand the Arabic and Iraqi mind and suffering, so that we reach a reasonable explanation in our evaluation for the situation.",1235779200,,477,4.804878048780488
8062155,4,B0009K3I9G,"This movie was very moving to me. The people of Iraq have spoken out about the changes that have taken place since the American's arrived in Baghdad, and the fall of Saddam Hussien's regime. Both positive feedback and negative feedback was exchanged between them. Iraqi's are still struggling to find peace in their homelands and hope to find a happy medium.",1234828800,,358,4.885245901639344
8062156,5,B0009K3I9G,"This is an excellent documentary which samples opinions from many Iraqis of different social, economic, and educational levels regarding the American occupation and the ousting of Saddam Hussein.  If you want to hear Iraqis who welcome the US soldiers as saviors, as well as those who believe they're occupying agressors who are only after oil, that's all here-- as well as opinions of every shade in between.

More significantly, seeing the different people in their own environment, speaking their own language and interacting both with the interviewers and with one another, gives an excellent and often-absent context for these opinions.  At the same time, seeing all the opinions together and in context, makes it clear to the viewer not only that there is more complexity of opinion than the normal sound-bites allow for, but also helps the viewer to understand how even within one country, different people with different backgrounds and interests, can have radically divergent opinions on this subject.

Incidentally, the fact that the interviewees are translated by means of subtitles, rather than dubbing, makes this an excellent resource for students of Arabic and Iraqi.  Most of the interviewees speak in Iraqi dialect, although the more educated ones speak in standard Arabic or English.  (Interestly enough, the more education Iraqis who speak in English and foojha tend to be much more anti-American than the more common Iraqis, which was a surprise to me, personally.)

All in all, an excellent documentary.",1132099200,9,1524,5.2987551867219915
