8158609,4,B000KQ1BOI,"`Chakra Bija Mantra Meditation' is not something one would enjoy for a passive viewing experience. It is a participation exercise, a workshop in the truest sense of the word. To make proper use of the material presented in this DVD one must be prepared to become an active participate in the program. As the narrator/teacher informs the audience, ""Seat yourself comfortably on the floor and prepare...""

You have now become the student and the lesson is about to begin. Colorful animated images representing the seven energy centers or charkas appear on the screen. The instructor takes you through the symbolism, function, associations and Sanskrit sounds associated with each charka in an easily understandable, methodical fashion slowly moving you up the spine on your journey towards Godhead. The journey is accompanied by intermittent shamanic style drumming, sitar music and gong music which adds to the meditative state of program and helps keep you focused on the instructor. The narration also moves back in forth from a male to a female instructor which was a nice change of pace and quite beneficial. This keeps the student from becoming too focused on the voice rather than the information.

Just about everything one needs to know is covered:
- How to pronounce the 50 Sanskrit letters.
- The location of the 7 energy centers.
- The 5 mouth positions.
- How to breathe.
- How to visualize.
Just to name a few.

This program is an excellent instructional, meditation tool. I could well imagine this DVD being used quite successfully as a classroom visual add and now you can have it to be used for personal one-on-one instruction in the comfort of your own home. One of the greatest drawbacks of solitary spiritual instruction is never knowing for sure whether you're pronouncing important sounds and words correctly. This DVD solves that problem.
