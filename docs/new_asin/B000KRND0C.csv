8158840,5,B000KRND0C,"John has had an interesting life.  He is Hawaiis finest singer.  He devotes so much of his time to our young people teaching them Hawaiian customs, ukelele, and singing.  His beliefs are to keep the traditions alive.  This video is a testiment to his life.  Many times the people of the U.S. forget about some of the most musically gifted people in the world, they live Hawaii.",1511222400,,377,4.567164179104478

8158842,5,B000KRND0C,It actually exceeded my expectations. John has a really interesting story to tell. It's candid and honest. He never tries to put a good spin on himself he just opens up and very thoughtfully shares aspects of his life. Not all that glitters is gold and John has had his share of ups and downs. It is a very good DVD.,1444867200,,316,4.19672131147541
