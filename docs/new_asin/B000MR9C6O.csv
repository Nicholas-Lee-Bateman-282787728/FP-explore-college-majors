8171162,2,B000MR9C6O,"I appreciate what the filmmaker is trying to do but it just wasn't done very well with this film. It has a few noteable scenes but don't get your hopes up too high (pun intended).

Check out Kevin Booth's ""The Last White Hope: America's Drug War"". It's not a comedy but incredibly informative. Also, see ""Plan Columbia: Cashing-in on the Drug War Failure"" by Gerard Ungerman and Audrey Brohy.",1176163200,9,392,4.681159420289855
