7359267,3,B012X4328M,"This DVD is for seniors with good mobility, i.e. can do all exercises standing.  It would be of greater use if it applied to individuals who need to use a chair.",1461456000,4,161,4.193548387096774
7359268,3,B012X4328M,"Some good exercises.  However, not hard enough for me.  This is best for those who have been fairly inactive for a while or have never worked out at all before.",1456531200,13,160,4.3

8726698,1,B012X4328M,Too much getting down on the floor and then up again.  Wore me out.,1500076800,2,67,3.7857142857142856
8726699,5,B012X4328M,I'm 67 years old and I love this workout for seniors. I have exercised all my life even went to cross fit for a few years. Oldest in my class. I had to stop for a year because of foot surgery. I decided to try something more gently . This is just enough to cause a good sweat.,1496188800,,276,3.7758620689655173
8726700,1,B012X4328M,Boring!! Maybe for someone who have never exercise before.  Come on who uses 1-3 lbs weights.,1495843200,,93,4.8125
8726701,1,B012X4328M,Sorry I bought it. It was a pain to keep moving to the next section. Very disappointing to say the least.,1494201600,,105,4.0476190476190474
8726702,3,B012X4328M,"Far too much getting up and down on the floor. Do floor exercises and then aerobic. A few on the floor and then back up on my feet. Then down on the floor. Hey, we're seniors. Some of us have bad knees",1489449600,5,201,3.8095238095238093
8726703,4,B012X4328M,"when i was looking for cardio-strenght training dvd this caught my eye. i thought it would be like absolute beginners cardio strength dvd, but it is not. i am a bit disappointed when i previewed it (that's why the four starts). it is mainly calistentics interspersed with weight training.",1487808000,2,288,4.8979591836734695
8726704,1,B012X4328M,Boring!  Not all seniors are this low energy.  Not enough Weightlifting.,1486339200,,72,5.454545454545454
8726705,5,B012X4328M,Awesome beginning workout.  Haven't exercised in years and is a wonderful way to ease back into it.  Love that it has different levels.  They explain all the moves and don't hurry you along.,1485129600,2,190,4.696969696969697
8726706,5,B012X4328M,The best workout video ever made for seniors. I LOVE IT. I purchased a copy for someone I know . I plan to buy them as gifts.,1475884800,,125,3.6666666666666665
8726707,2,B012X4328M,This workout for seniors requires you to define how senior you are: If you have arthritis or are significantly overweight or more elderly The Doctor's Workout will be difficult since there is a lot of lying down on the floor and then standing up over and over again. Also push ups and planks and crunches will be very very difficult if your joints are arthritic like mine. During the up and down and up and down portions of this workout I either do other exercises in my repetoire (not theirs) or fast forward to the next set on the dvd. The most usable portions of the exercises are those involving the weights.,1461888000,20,612,4.473214285714286
