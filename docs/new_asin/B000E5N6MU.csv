8321793,5,B000E5N6MU,"As a child I grew up adoring the Los Angeles Lakers and the NBA.  I almost adopted basketball as a second religion, watching and analyzing games and players while also trying to teach myself the game.  However, there were  those moments where even the stingiest of statisticians had to just sit  back and watch.  This video exemplifies those moments.  From last minute  (or second) heroics to complete and utter domination, this video covers the  pride and passion for the game of basketball with the talent and tenacity  of those who contributed to making it something special.  The years of  Finals games that were recorded visually are had their special moments  where certain players or teams stepped out of the shadows and broke the  mold to dare and accomplish mighty things.  This is a teaching tool for  those who want to be an avid fan and is a source of validation for those  who already are.  The average fan gets to see only what is present, but  this video helps re-establish the legacy of the past as well as setting the  stage for future surprises.  For the past couple years in the NBA Finals, I  contemplated that those majestic moments of sheer will and desire had  passed as the game deteriorated into slugfest after boring slugfest,  offering only the comfort that stars of character like David Robinson and  Tim Duncan achieved their ambitions but never offering an insight into what  makes the game worth watching.  Then, after this year's Laker's/Pacer's  series, I was consoled with fine basketball and the hope that another 100  greatest plays are in the making.  Until that compilation is constructed,  however, I still love to see this movie and re-live the previous one  hundred.",963792000,24,1707,4.843205574912892
