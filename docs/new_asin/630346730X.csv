653358,5,630346730X,"This is an over the top flick! The best hooker flick I ever seen, and I gotta tell ya, Lou Diamond Phillips was a trip! You gotta see this movie. It's a must see. It's even better than Angel.",1231804800,2,191,3.923076923076923
653359,3,630346730X,"Pimps are some of the lowest people on Earth. To make money whoring yourself is one thing: to make money off somebody else's whoring is just super low. I get so angry when I see people in hip-hop culture glorifying pimps and treating them like heroic figures. They're not heroic. They're not sympathetic either: I don't care what the Hustle and Flow people tell you. They abuse, misuse, and exploit women to make money. They're trashy, lazy bums who don't have the guts to sell their own ass.

Well, if my tirade isn't enough to turn you against pimping, Lou Diamond Philips will. This dude is terrible. He is a cold-blooded murdering evil prick who makes Rae Dawn Chong's and Kari Wuhrer's life hell. Kari's character is running away from her abusive, psychotic husband, and Rae's character is a hard-nosed prostitute who refuses Lou's ""protection."" Kari is homeless and Rae (Ola) takes her in. Soon Kari is hookering along with Rae while her husband tries to track her down.

This story ends tragically. How else could a movie like this end? God, the ending is horribly sad. This movie is so gritty, I can barely watch all of it anymore. Boulevard makes me dislike pimps more than I already did, which explains my diatribe at the beginning of the review. Even though Boulevard is fictional, the story itself is all too real and common.

It's hard out there for a pimp? Then it must be ten times harder for the hookers: you know, the ones who do the ACTUAL work.",1142380800,8,1463,4.619230769230769
653360,2,630346730X,"Fleeing from an abusive boyfriend, Jennefer (Kari Wuhrer) hops a bus to Toronto and ends up on the Boulevard, where prostitutes, drug dealers and the down and out reside. Ola (Rae Dawn Chong), who works the corner, takes her in from the cold. Hassan (Lou Diamond Phillips) is the local pimp. Eventually Jennefer takes up prostitution as well, and she and Ola must dodge Hassan, the cops and Jennefer's boyfriend who has come to find her.

In the midst of incredible brutality all around, the two women fall in love. The love scene is wonderfully sensual and memorable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is lacking, and the Hassan character in particular is a cardboard stereotype. It's just another abusive boyfriend/evil pimp film.",1115596800,,735,4.975609756097561
653361,5,630346730X,"This movie is an experience. Earthy and touching ,it pulls few punches. It features probally Wuhrer's best performance. Chong delivers a terrific performance as well. Lou Diamond Philips gives a great performance as the despicable pimp. The cast performances are excellent right down the line. The movie shows a side of life that most people really don't understand and gives us a chance to feel with and for the characters. The sometimes brutal and shocking nature of some of the scenes make it tough to watch but it is effective. It's not a movie you will forget about quickly. It also leads us to believe there is hope for tenderness and personal humanity at any level of existance. Hidden amongst the nudity,the sleaze,the shocks,there is a gem. This is worth watching.",1016064000,11,773,4.908396946564886
653362,5,630346730X,"Jennifer (Kari Wuhrer) turns to prostitution to raise money in order to have her baby raised in safety away from her abusive husband. Jennifer has her baby adopted, planning to reclaim her within the 90 limit. Her husband is livid and is determined to have his wife returned to him. With no options in front of her, Jennifer gets on a bus and leaves town. Cold and homeless Jennifer has to develop a tough outer skin in order to survive her new life. Befriended by a fellow prostitute (Ray Dawn Chong), and with a pimp (Lou Diamond Phillips) casting his eye over her, Jennifer has her hands full!

653445,4,630346730X,"I saw this movie years ago and I really liked it. Since it has been years I wanted to watch it again and was reminded that it's a good movie. Lou Diamond Phillips is really good as the evil pimp and Rae Dawn Chong is good as the prostitute who befriends a girl running away from an abusive boyfriend. Not a great movie, but a good movie.",1457308800,,337,4.044776119402985

653447,5,630346730X,"This is the great white whale of Boulevard Movies, a genre of picture that ran from the 70s to the 90s that focused on the prostitute section of major cities and the lives of those that exist in those areas. A hybrid of action/drama/horror, Boulevard movies follow main characters trying to exist in a dark planet of sexual and drug slavery, sort of graphic Dave Goodis style modern noir pictures. Two of the best of these kinds of movies are Angel and Scarred, the later referred to being the Citizen Kane of Teenage Hooker movies. However, the rarest of these pictures is Boulevard, the great white whale of Boulevard Movies, a fantastic Canadian picture set in the seedy section of Toronto. Rae Dawn Chong is excellent as the hardened street hooker showing the ropes to the newbie, and Lou Diamond Phillips is creepo as the creepo with some of the eeriest portrayal of an Arab by a non-Arab actor since Gene Simmons in Wanted Dead of Alive. As will all films that are only distributed in the US on Amazon Prime, this one is well, well worth checking out. As with Scarred, this Boulevard picture was directed by a woman.",1456099200,,1122,4.615

653450,4,630346730X,its hard to find something good to say about a movie about hookers & a low life pimp.  how can two people find love while they are out selling their bodies on the street while a scum pimp is harassing& beating the crap out of them.  at what point should the women have seen the error of their ways and left that slow spiral to hell.  the movie did a very good job of showing the lost and the damned.  & somebody always has to die before one can see the light and then walk away from it all.  its better to see the light before someone dies.,1454371200,,540,3.962962962962963

7847728,4,630346730X,A pulp novel come to life. It draws you in like a car crash that keeps going and going. This is certainly gritty 90's exploitation cinema at its best with Kari Wuhrer and Rae Dawn Chong.,1482710400,,186,4.194444444444445
7847729,3,630346730X,"Boulevard is a film about a young mother who is fleeing a bad relationship with a man that beats her, and who has given up her new born baby for adoption.  She goes to the big city with no money and no place to stay.  She is homeless and on the street where the local hookers ply their trade. She gets involved with an older prostitute who take her in.  The two develop a relationship which eventually ends when the older prostitute gets killed by the local pimp.  Lou Diamond Phillip does a good job playing the pimp.  Rae Dawn Chong plays the older prostitute well.  Kari Wuherer is the young runaway whose performance is passable but not as good as it could be.  Lance Hendrickson's performance as the police detective working the beat is strained and not convincing.  It's as if he was just going thru the motions.  The movie has sex, nudity, and violence against women which shows the sex trade industry for what it really is, but the interaction between the players seemed contrived and a bit too sweet.",1479600000,2,1009,4.5

Lou diamond played a really bad boy pimp on this movie he really played this part all the way.  Rae Dawn did a good job aswell, her character is a prostitute that hold her own.  Kari Wuhrer character just had a baby girl & wanted to get her life together & to get away from a abusive boyfriend.  I recommend watching this movie.  This movie is a great TB for me.

7847733,3,630346730X,"This movie borders on awful. The acting is over the top, the scenes are unbelievable, and the movie has little to no moral story. There are moments I found myself laughing despite the serious subject matter. The film starts off mildly entertaining and has a gritty, raw quality. But then the action takes an unbelievable turn. This is a Lifetime movie on steroids. There are some painful moments that are difficult to watch. The latter half of the film is a disappointment. I give it three stars because it keeps your attention, but sometimes for the wrong reasons.",1469318400,,565,4.775510204081633
