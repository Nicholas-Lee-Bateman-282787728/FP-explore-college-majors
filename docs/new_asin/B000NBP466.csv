In 2001 Rede Globo produced their acclaimed adaptation of Os Maias (including some elements from Ea's short novel A Rel&iacute;quia, ""The Relic"") as a short soap-opera type serial in 40 chapters, which was shown from Tuesday to Friday during a ten week period. It starred a very select group of Brazilian actors, most of them with long careers on TV, theatre and cinema. The screenplay was adapted by the renowned soap opera writer Maria Adelaide Amaral and directed by Luiz Fernando Carvalho. This is considered one of the most outstanding Globo productions in terms of photographic and overall artistic quality",1229040000,2,737,5.090909090909091
