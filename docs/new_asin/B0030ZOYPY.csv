8386321,5,B0030ZOYPY,"I'd consider myself rather difficult to please when it comes to an anime, let alone giving the anime 5 stars, but Darker Than Black is one of the few animes which I feel deserves those 5 stars. The music is great, the characters are great (especially the main male character), and the series keeps strong even through the second season. It's a serious anime, but it has some humorous undertones.

Since I know I personally find it helpful to find out what other animes the reviewer I'm reading likes in order to help me build the reviews credibility in my own eyes, I consider Darker Than Black on par with my other favorites: Inuyasha, Saiyuki, Fruits Basket, and Soul Eater.",1301961600,,676,4.633333333333334
8386322,1,B0030ZOYPY,"This was....A chore when it came to watching anime for me!  Coming from watching 12 kingdoms, Tsubasa, Berserk, Bleach, Inuyasha, D-Gray Man, etc etc----as in if you enjoy these listed anime titles you won't find what your looking for in Darker then Black, IMO.  I quit watching around half way through disc four---so I gave this an honest try!  I don't care how much you can make great sound or graphics, if your story is as coherent as chop suey, I gotta put you on the ebay list to sell sell sell!  Which I am listing now on my ebay account as I am writing this.  My HUGE problem with this series was INFORMATION!  The story just goes off in so many minor different directions and gives you little background info on who/what is going on----and the characters just do NOT absorb me into the story at all.  There are many other anime titles (as previously mentioned) That KNOW how to do background stories and create characters that you care about watching to see how they develop.  This does not come close for me.  When it came time to watch anime, this was a chore---then I finally said I cannot watch anymore, I am selling it and going on to something else!  A better suggestion for a DYNAMITE story to watch?!?!!? Try DEATHNOTE!!  What great story telling!!  Stay away from Darker then Black, This is almost as bad as ""Air"" IMO, lol.",1293494400,3,1340,4.491735537190083
8386323,3,B0030ZOYPY,"I bought this item without reading the reviews and I can confirm the playback issues on disc 3. I've only had issues with episode 18, but I can see why a recall is necessary. I'd recommend buying the new release Darker than Black: The Complete First Season.",1275436800,3,257,4.48936170212766
8386324,3,B0030ZOYPY,"I haven't had a chance to watch the series yet so I won't comment on the series itself.

Funimation has issued a recall for this box set. Disc three in every set has a defect that causes audio and video playback issues. The set is scheduled to be re-released in May.

Amazon needs to remove their copies and sent them back to Funimation instead of selling defective merchandise.",1269820800,40,378,4.544117647058823
8386325,5,B0030ZOYPY,"I watched this series online as it was airing. The story is very compelling and always stays interesting and fresh. I love that it melds the sci-fi aspect of people who can use super powers with the real life intrigue of organized crime and the battle between varying governmental organizations.

Another big reason I love the show, probably the main reason why I like it is because every character who is introduced, even if it is only for an episode, is a real character. You get a feeling of who they are as people, not just as enemies. Sometimes it is hard to know who to route for as some of the characters are really touching.

In addition to this it is also really interesting to try and figure out what power, and contract each person has, or who they are working for, or what their motives are (if they have any). Over all the sotry is very well written and definitely worth checking out, especially for under 30 dollars!",1269043200,,930,4.464705882352941
8386326,4,B0030ZOYPY,"I really enjoyed the ""Darker Than Black"" anime series. This an interesting and involved Sci-Fi story that has a lot of violence, action, and humor.

No spoilers from me, the storyline is set in the near future, the ""Hell's Gate"" has opened in Tokyo (and another in South America), all of the stars in the sky have been replaced by fake stars that are representations of ""Contractors"" (see below). The episodes somewhat slowly bring us up to speed on the back story of people with special abilities, like ""Contractors"" (remorseless assassins with special powers that come with a price), ""Dolls"" (basically blank humans who can be implanted with temporary memories/personalities or who can perform specific functions like remote sensing and observation), and hybrids are thrown into the mix as well.

There are several groups of players interacting, including a special police unit that tracks ""Contractors"", The Syndicate (including the main ""Contractor"" Hei/Bk201/The Black Reaper), various governments (references to French, Americans, and British spy agencies), and other criminal groups (all employing ""Contractors"").

As the storyline unfolds it becomes apparent that not all ""Contractors"" follow the stereotype and we learn something about Hei's motivation for why he does what he does. There are a lot of call backs to events in earlier episodes and key characters get developed nicely.

The animation was passable overall. It has some truly beautiful artwork in some scenes and some of the flattest animation in others. There was anime style blood and gore, but far less than I have come to expect.

The series wraps up all of the major plot lines by the end and it looks like there is a second season soon to be released.

Overall this is an interesting series, recommended for fans of the genre.

8386327,5,B0030ZOYPY,"It is now the future. Ten years ago, two Gates, areas where mysterious and often deadly events occur, formed (Hell's Gate in Tokyo and Heaven's Gate in South America) and with them came the birth of Contractors (psychics who use their powers in exchange for a loss of emotions and for a specific price) and Dolls (emotionless beings who can send out their observer spirits to track others).

The story of Darker Than Black follows BK-201 (alias Hei, Li Shengshun, the Black Reaper, etc.), a masked, cable-wielding Contractor with an affinity for electricity, in his work for a shady Syndicate with unknown goals. While he seems to follow the Syndicate's orders, he might have other priorities that come before it, as it looks like he's searching for someone...

Darker Than Black is divided into multiple two to three episode arcs, connected mainly by the cast of recurring characters. Each arc focuses on a different group of characters, including Hei's fellow Syndicate members Yin (a silver-haired Doll), the gruff Huang, and Mao (a Contractor who can possess animals) as well as Hei's pursuer, the policewoman Misaki Kirihara, and of course, a cast of minor characters. Like in most episodic or arc-based anime, some arcs are great while others could be better.

Darker Than Black is an action series at its core, and a good deal of violence occurs as Hei deals with the Contractors he meets with in each arc. I'd suggest watching the first five minutes or so of the first episode on Funimation's website before purchasing this, as it gives you a good idea of what to expect. The violence might not be quite on the level of, say, Elfen Lied or Baccano!, but it is still worth mentioning.

The animation and art in this series are fantastic. It was animated by Studio BONES, the ones responsible for Fullmetal Alchemist, RahXephon, Eureka Seven, etc., and Darker Than Black has equally good production values. The animation is fluid in the series' action scenes, and the characters are never noticeably off-model. The characters have very appealing character designs, and both those and the setting are incredibly stylish.

The sound in this series is also great. The music was composed by Yoko Kanno, the person behind Cowboy Bebop's score, and it doesn't disappoint. It ranges from calm piano pieces to more energetic themes played during tense situations, and none of it grates on your ears. The opening and ending themes fit the series as well, with the first ending, ""Tsukiakari"" (""Moonlight"") being a personal favorite. Unlike many anime, the English dub track on Darker Than Black is consistently good. Hei's English voice actor, Jason Liebrecht, goes from cold and calculating in the character's Hei persona to sweet and kind as his cover Li Shengshun, and the other characters receive equally good voice acting. The Japanese dub is fantastic as well, and it really doesn't matter which language you choose to listen to.

In the end, the one main problem I have with Darker Than Black apart from a few mediocre arcs is its ending. It is very confusing and open-ended (I personally think it was a bit rushed) and isn't the best ending such a good series could receive. Just a note: while the series consists of 26 episodes, it ends on episode 25, with episode 26 being a sidestory OVA. The real ending leaves the world of Darker Than Black ready for a sequel, and in fact, one just finished in Japan, Darker Than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini (Gemini of the Meteor). Unfortunately, this sequel doesn't really solve any of the lingering questions from Season 1, but this does mean that you shouldn't feel too upset that it hasn't been licensed yet.

On whole, Darker Than Black is a visually appealing action series that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre. For me, it was worth tracking down the individual volumes when they came out, and this complete first season provides the same experience for a cheaper price.",1264636800,16,3938,4.851190476190476
8386328,5,B0030ZOYPY,"This is a great series!  I watched it online as it was released (very hard to wait for every episode!).  Beginning with my favorite musical composer Yoko Kanno (escaflowne, cowboy bebop, macross, RahXephon, Ghost in the shell), and a story by my favorite team Bones (rahXephon, Scrapped Princess, Wolf's Rain, Fullmetal Alchemist, Eureka Seven, Xam'd: Lost Memories), as well as a top notch voice acting cast (Japanese at least, I haven't watched in English).

The story (don't worry, no spoilers) is set in a future where 2 gates have opened; One in Japan, and one in South America.  World governments are trying to figure out what these gates are, and what the correlation is between these gates and the emotionless contractors which have shown up at the same time.  Hei (a contractor working for the syndicate) is trying to find someone he loved and lost, while trying to protect his new love.  All the while he is being pursued by a government agency.  Action packed, and will keep you guessing, in a creative and interesting world.

Other notes:  While this season was awesome, there is a 2nd season (Ryusei no Gemini) which is exciting for the most part, but has a very disappointing ending.  It is a short season(12 ep), that follows a different main character and may be a filler series similar to ""Fumoffu"" as a part of ""fullmetal panic"", or ""The Endless Summer"" is to Haruhi.  But I am not sure if there will be another full season, or if Gemini managed to kill the series.  While Season 1 explains a great deal of what is going on (which is a part of what makes the show interesting), Gemini raises a bunch of questions, and then quickly ignores them all to wrap up the plot in the last 2-3 episodes.

Update!
Finally bought the series for an AMV project because the version I downloaded was not nicely convertable to something editable.  The video was 24fps 16:9!  Excellent quality for a DVD, and up-scales nicely.  Even arrived a day earlier than originally quoted!",1262563200,5,1979,4.709302325581396
