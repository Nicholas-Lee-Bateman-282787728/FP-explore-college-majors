7990328,4,B00009AV8N,"The program itself is great, crisp sharp graphics with vivid colors, good Stereo soundtrack, terrific episodes. But I CANNOT turn OFF the dang closed captioning. I clicked ""Off"" on the Subtitle Options Menu (several times!), -nothing. I had to watch the whole thing with the captioning on.

If you are experiencing problems with your Yu-Gi-Oh! discs, dear reader, you are not alone.

Still, these are some really great episodes and are totally worth it.",1345852800,3,453,5.108108108108108
7990329,5,B00009AV8N,This is one of those YuGiOh dvd that you could watch over and over - the epic battle between Pegasus and Yugi.  I have watched this many times with my daughters and would recommend it for anyone to add to their collection.,1306713600,2,222,4.285714285714286
7990330,5,B00009AV8N,"My favorite Cartoon, and the best three episodes of it on one DVD! Aftermath gives unique insight on Pegasus' life and justifies his motives - he's not the antagonist you once thought him to be! Great Millennium Eye shots too. This DVD features Match of the Millennium Episodes 38 and 39, and the final Aftermath Episode (40) that ends the Pegasus saga (unfortunatly). I loved watching this several years back and the twisted laughs of Darren Dunstan still get me laughing. I love it! You've got to admit, Ancient Egyptian fiction is, well, brilliant.",1175731200,4,551,4.872340425531915
