animation series found out how. I only wish they had made more of them. If you want a great way for your kids and grandkids to learn about the Bible, forget American gimmicky junk - buy these!",1371254400,,305,4.016393442622951
7916791,4,B000035Z5B,"Unfortunately the video quality is quite  poor (makes me wonder if I got a boot-leg copy?), but the claymation animation is very good. It is also quite short at 30 minutes or less. My 9 year old boy and girl liked it very much. It's a decent buy if you can purchase it very inexpensively.",1356652800,,288,4.236363636363636
7916792,5,B000035Z5B,"This is the biblical story of Ruth, from the Book of Ruth in the Old Testament of the bible. It is a great version of this story, very intelligent, not made just for kids. The 3D model stop animation is very high quality and stylized, and the story flows in such a way as to keep an adult very interested. There are some changes made to keep the story flowing, but nothing to offend. Just like a regular movie, they have to trim to keep the story moving. I try to enjoy these and other biblical films as inspiration, but read my bible for authenticity. Since this story is very short in the bible, they did not need to change much. Any time you watch a biblical movie or animated film, it is always best to know the story first in my opinion.

I was very impressed with the sets, costumes, and the character modeling. They proved that this is possible in an animation project. The range of emotion and personality they obtain from the model characters was better than many projects I have seen on film with live actors!  Another episode in the series, ""Joseph"", perhaps captured this even better.

The ""Testament: Bible in Animation"" series, produced over 10 years ago by Christmas films in Wales and Russia for the BBC, is not made for kids, but for all ages. I believe HBO family channel ran these for awhile a few years ago. There are other DVD's in the series that are stand alone title's, also about 30 minutes each. The series includes 8 titles, ""Daniel"", ""David and Saul"",""Moses"", ""Jonah"", ""The Creation and Noah"", ""Elijah"" (my favorite), ""Ruth"", ""Joseph"", and ""Abraham"". The last 3 are in model stop motion animation, (like the holiday TV specials). They are not puppets per say, but models shot one frame at a time, a process that can take a film crew months to shoot a few minutes.
If you want a good deal, there is another set from the same company that has 4 of the 30 minute stories from this Testament series in a 2 DVD box set. ""Testament: The Bible in Animation Collection"" is the title to search for, and Amazon.com is where I bought it. The price is almost the same as buying one individual story. That set has Jonah, Abraham, Elijah, and the Creation/Noah story. I recommend all in the series.",1259625600,,2212,4.497512437810945
