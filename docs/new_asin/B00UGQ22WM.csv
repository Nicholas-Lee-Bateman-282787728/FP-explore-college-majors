8706336,1,B00UGQ22WM,The movie was awesome. The copy not so hot.  Very scratched.  Had to fuss with it to see the movie.  Will be looking elsewhere for another copy.,1505606400,,144,4.2592592592592595

8706338,5,B00UGQ22WM,"The DVD's cover art is the biggest spoiler of all.

This is a great movie - I would encourage watching the DVD extras - getting some of the interviews about casting.  It makes you appreciate the performances much more - especially Russell Crowe.

The movie appeals to many strata of our movie viewing population.  There is enough cultural detail to appeal to the anthropologists in us, enough physical comedy for the 3 Stooges fans, enough sentimentality for the romantics, enough commercial bravado and excellence for the Wolf of Wall Street fans...  You can watch this with people of any age.  A good movie - one of the best in my collection.",1494979200,,644,4.756756756756757
