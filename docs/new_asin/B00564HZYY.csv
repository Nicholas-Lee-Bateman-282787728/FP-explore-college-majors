4586291,5,B00564HZYY,"This film, Judas Kiss, was absolutely amazing, and everyone leaving the film festival theater where I recently saw it was touched by it and its message of regret, redemption, and hope for the future. Judas Kiss has a little bit of something for everyone, but most especially, it is a story that every viewer can relate to... reflection upon one's own life, regret over decisions made, and what you might have done differently if you could. In this innovative film, the character of Zach actually does get a chance to change some things in his younger life. But will his younger self, in that ""all-knowing-invincible arrogance"" of teenage youth, listen to his older self, and take a different path that will change both of their futures? That indeed is the question in this charmer of a film.

The film has a professional and compelling soundtrack, lighting, photography, and editing, I was blown away by its message of regret, redemption, and the possibility of change. Charlie David, Sean Lockhart, Timo Descamps, Julia Morizawa, and the rest of the cast truly give stellar performances, beyond what is often expected in independent films.

Viewers will be transported to this quirky, mystical intersection of time and space, and experience similar emotions as the characters on screen. Viewers will ponder how they, too, could change their own life, and, indeed, change their own future. Beginning right then and there. I know this for a fact because everyone at the film festival where it played did just that. Everyone was thinking about it. To me, that is the success of this smart and bright indie film from director/writer J.T. Tepnapa and producer/writer Carlos Pedraza (who were amazing in the Question and Answer session held afterward).

Be aware, Judas Kiss is an edgy film, and there are several graphic and emotional scenes that are intentionally made to evoke some emotional response from the viewers. That being said, all is done tastefully and artistically, and viewers will be glad that they saw this little gem of a film.

I can't wait for it to be available on DVD -- it will definitely be a stocking stuffer for many of my friends -- gay, straight, bi, and whatever.",1317772800,38,2187,4.91869918699187
4586292,5,B00564HZYY,"""Judas Kiss"" lets us walk that path of wondering, amid mistakes and a life that feels stuck in neutral, if I could fix a huge mistake could my life have been different?  With gay lives at the center of a universal story it is accessible to all, it represents a film with broad appeal.",1317686400,12,284,4.2592592592592595
4586293,5,B00564HZYY,"This is a fun coming of age film with some interesting twists, that you probably haven't seen before. The cinematography was well executed and propelled the story well. I'm glad to have been a part of the crew. (I was the sound mixer/recordist for the film.)",1317600000,7,258,4.630434782608695
4586294,4,B00564HZYY,"For me, Judas Kiss (which I saw at the Frameline Film Festival in San Francisco this past June)represents a huge leap in indie gay film making. After years of coming out stories (who have their place, but are clichd riddled these days), it was fun to see a movie where no one was suicidal about being gay, was not being beat up because they're gay or just worried they could be gay. It also differs from the others in this genre with its lush cinematography and impressive use of CGI effects (and on such a low-budget I know these movies work with). In this film, screenwriter Carlos Pedraza (the web series Star Trek: Phase II) and director J.T. Tepnapa (the funny short Masturbation: Putting the Fun into Self-Loving and the web series Star Trek: Hidden Frontier) takes a simple idea -what if you could go back in time and change your past- and spins a tale about the paths we choose when we're young, and how (at the time) we never think about the consequences of our actions. From that idea, the movie then borrows equal parts The Twilight Zone and a dash of A Christmas Carol and takes us on a journey that while familiar, it is never boring. Charlie David has never been better, giving a wonderful performance of a man in search of redemption for the sins of his past. Then there is Richard Harmon who shines as the troubled young man in search of life outside the reach of his damaged father (he also gave a creepy and memorable performance in AMC's The Killing this past spring). Harmon is brilliantly watchable in what should be a breakout performance. Meanwhile, Belgium singer/actor Timo Descamps as the evil Big Man on Campus is equally as good, along with the talented Julia Morizawa. Then there's Sean Paul Lockhart as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Well known for his gay adult films as Brent Corrigan, Lockhart proves he can act. He's likable, charming and vulnerable, but confident in what he wants. Like Harmon, this could be a game changer for the him.",1314921600,75,1969,4.596590909090909

4586296,1,B00564HZYY,"Watching Judas Kiss is like spending 90 minutes with a dysfunctional family -- you can't wait to get away from them. The plot about a film maker traveling back in time to his university to visit himself is refreshingly different from the usual gay-themed fare, but like too many supernatural films, it quickly becomes a confusing mess.  But the biggest problem here is none of the characters are likable.  They're all bitchy and bitter.  Even all the cigarette smoking seems to poison the atmosphere. It's hard to imagine this won awards, but maybe the edginess appeals at some level.  I also have to note the irony of a film that tries to pay homage to cinema (the lead character is named Wells, as in Orson Wells) is decidedly uncinematic -- much too dialogue heavy.",1505779200,,768,4.708955223880597
4586297,4,B00564HZYY,"Because of the many nevative reviews, I waited months before beginning JUDUS KISS and I was ready to hit the X as soon as Charlie David took the screen.  He is a gay actor who has problems playing gay characters-go figure.  This performance may well be his best with two other actors giving stellar (maybe breakout) performances. Much is made of the Lockhart character but for the wrong reason.  I urge everyone to look past the actors past ""performances"" and gauge his performance as the spurned suitor.

The story is about a man, past his youth, forced to look back at a single moment in time that lead him down a road, far from the greatness he sought. The story centers on  four young college students with a student film festival as the backdrop.

Could be written and filmed better, some of the supporting actors may be weak but overall JUDAS KISS is well worth the time. This is an unapologetically  gay movie, with unapologetically gay characters and unapologetically gay actors playing unapologetically gay scenes.  The climax came as a some what shocking moment and the last scene is a bit overplayed but in 2011 the gay community still had not learned to speak without explaining.

Now for the some of the negative ""reviews"", although we appreciate the progressive straight supportive community, please do not feel the need to ""objectively"" review gay films.  You should not feel the need to grace us with your wisdom.  We can make it on our own.",1494460800,4,1457,4.742063492063492
4586298,2,B00564HZYY,"Really bad storyline.  A film maker goes back to his old college to be a judge of a film-making competition that he once entered when he was a college student. While there, he has a one night stand with a young freshman student.  It turns out that this freshman is himself in an alternate reality, sort of a second chance for him to re-do whatever wrong he did the first time.  Supposedly he cheated the first time around to win the competition, but the movie doesn't quite delve into what really happened other than it was not the right thing.  The story is often confusing and actors were not very natural as some scenes were a bit dramatized.  With all the high ratings, I expected more, but it was a weak movie starting with the story.  They tried to create emotions from the audience with this movie, but the story was too unrealistic to be taken seriously.",1491436800,,862,4.45859872611465

This is not always as bad as you might think -- but you do realize the plot is not to be taken seriously, and the actors can't really act. However, in this version only two of the pretty boys {Charlie David and Sean Paul Lockhart} actually are pretty and seem natural . They are surrounded by people who are far too aware that they are on camera. They both deserve a better movie. And, oh yes, David's friend --whom we see paired with him in the last shot, is also very attractive and believable -- too bad we didn't get to see more of him.",1480896000,,720,4.22463768115942

Richard Harmon is really intense and magnetic in this one and you CANNOT take your eyes off of him. He's so strikingly beautiful it actually hurts. I hope we will see him again soon as lead in other feature films, as he's got a face for success and he's very versatile as an actor (even though he is often type-cast as the bad boy).
As for Sean Paul Lockhart, whom I didn't know prior to this, I thought he was really cute and rather convincing in his role (unlike Timo who was really dreadful to watch, I'm sorry to say).

The story line provides additional sensitivity to viewers because in the eyes of a young film maker, that which may launch his career as an acclaimed movie entrepreneur, is the very story that has haunted and destroyed his past. So, does he risk it all by telling this story and also risk lose all his financial support for film school from his only family member or does he retract a hideous story, a narrative that exposes the raw and unpleasant past of our main character, losing the film festival, and ruining his opportunity to tell a life that should never be experienced by another.",1417132800,2,921,4.685185185185185

Fine production value, only the sound suffered a bit, should have been repaired in post production (doesn't detract though).

I especially liked the way the young film-maker was only thinking of hilmself and hurting others close to him; their reactions were beautifully portrayed, as indeed was he as Mister Self-centred. It was hard to  take in the story of the time travel,  whereby a man met his younger self (the film maker)  and his older self, until the final scene, and then it all became clear. That denouement was a big help on the feel-good factor for the film. Some excellent cameos enlivened the action, and the mature woman who played the college principal was up there with the best  of the cine headmistresses. The plot of the film within the the film within the fantasy  - a father raping  his son  - did not fully satisfy my need to understand where the young anti-hero was coming from, and it did not explain his later relatiionship with his father fully, but I guess it was just about ok..

4586461,4,B00564HZYY,"An original theme, Judas Kiss is a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001T5D6LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>, The Butterfly Effect and a Zac Efron-esque film rolled into one. Playing off the time dimensional effects of ""what if"" you could change your path in life (or control yourself doing so), it definitely spins in some unique directions, but loosely connects all the pieces by the films ending.  I would quickly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Butterfly-Effect/dp/B001Q2ZHZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Butterfly Effect</a>&nbsp;far more over Judas Kiss if you're looking for the concept of changing your life by changing what you did in the past.

On the upside, the ensemble cast is generally strong and certainly pleasing to the eye.  Key actors include Charlie David (also in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulligans/dp/B00274GGT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulligans</a>), Canadian Richard Harmon (with a TV/Movie career back to 2003) and Brent Corrigan (real name Sean Paul Lockhart and a former gay porn star). Certainly a combination you don't see every day.

On the downside, the time dimensional concept was a bit weak for me, but I understood what they were trying to achieve.  Flow from scene to scene was OK, but at times the film just seemed awkward.  A few more dramatic scenes helped make up for the weaker moments and I hoped for more.

The DVD extras feature a nice collection of behind the scenes clips, some deleted scenes and a music video&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Like-It-Rough/dp/B004ATN6X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Like It Rough</a>&nbsp;featuring Timo Descamps, another actor in the film.  In the extras, the production team really tries to emphasize how this is a film for everyone, and not just a gay film.  While true in concept, the primary focus is on 4 gay characters, 3 of which sleep around with one another, so tell me how that would appeal to a broader audience demographic?

In the end, I liked the film, and would recommend it to a friend and likely watch it again.  It's not a 5-star gem, nor do I understand the 1 and 2-star reviews - that seems quite harsh.  For an independent (usually low budget) film, I thought they did an excellent job overall and it's certainly deserving of 3 or 4 stars (out of 5).",1381017600,,2477,5.966101694915254

4586485,5,B00564HZYY,"I thought the ""Back to Future"" twist given to the coming of age story line of this movie is very promising.  Here are my ratings of the movie:

Story Line - 4/5
Interesting supernatural premise and the interwoven lives of all the characters are very well done.  I just wish the ending is more defined or they will come up with volume 2 because I really want to know how the futures have changed for the characters

Casting - 5/5
All the actors are well chosen for their parts. Not only are they beautiful but are they simply unforgetable. I must confess I have rewinded & watch my favourite romantic parts (the kisses among the boys) often!

Acting - 5/5
There is substance behind all those pretty faces. Both main & supporting actors seemed to breathe & live their part so effortlessly. I adore the delicious sexual tension and bittersweet atmosphere as the character Daniel is paired with Zach (his future self), Chris & Shane.

Soundtrack - 5/5
The music and songs chosen really enhanced the atmosphere in this movie. I bought them from AMZN & listened to them over & over again during my long daily commute.  Each time I hear ""Crash"" or ""If I Fall"", they conjured up images of my favourite scenes from the movie.

Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to any yaoi fan out there.  It every single indie or major gay romantic movie can be this visually beautiful, it may make me give up my yaoi manga collections!",1350777600,3,1422,4.545098039215686

I first saw this wonderful performance at the Chicago Reeling Festival in the fall of 2011, but waited until I had purchased the DVD before presenting my review.  I was Blown Away!! Personally, I think this is Charlie David's best performance to date. Even better than when he stared in his own story ""Mulligan"". His entourage of co-stars not only compliment each other and Mr. David, they exemplify themselves beyond comparison. When I first saw Sean Paul Lockhart in a production other than from his own company I knew he was destined to do much better given the right opportunity; J.T. Tepnapa gives him that opportunity in Judas Kiss and he sours into excellence. I sincerely hope he continues his endeavors into this genre as I am convinced he is destined to a leading role before too long! Timo DesCamps blesses us not only with a brief interlude with his wonderful voice but also ignites our libido with a marvelous speaking role, bringing ""bad boy"" to an intriguing persona. And Richard Harmon just gives us one more side of him that a lot of us wish we could have seen years ago! His performance is not only riveting but true to form in the Richard Harmon manner and oh so believable! Director J.T. Tepnapa, producers Carlos Pedraza, Jody Wheeler, Charlie David have assembled a cast that brings this story to life and leaves us wishing that it never ended.

The idea is hardly new, but ""Judas Kiss"" explores a new avenue: meeting one's younger self and trying to persuade him to seek better options. The little self-conscious twist here is that the main character is a failed film maker, so in a sense, he is afforded the chance for a lifetime ""re-take."" This is a very sincere, intelligent effort with remarkably high production values for its low budget; inventive, sensitive direction and fine visual sense; and uniformly touching performances from  Sean Paul Lockhart (in a stunningly nuanced, moving dramatic portrayal), Richard Harmon, and Charlie David.

Some of the movie was predictable. I really had a hard time believing the younger self. His pouting kind of annoyed me too.

The campus setting was good, the lighting, the cinematography, make-up, sound... all pretty good as well. The music was a little plodding. I guess the directing wasn't bad as well.

4586504,5,B00564HZYY,"Judas Kiss stars Charlie David as a down-on-his-luck filmmaker who gets wrangled into going back to his college to judge a student film festival.  Thing is, one of the students whose work he's judging is in fact himself.  From years ago.  But this isn't exactly Back to the Future stuff either.  Not only is he able to interact with his ""past"" self, in the present, but they interact quite intimately, if temporarily.  It's a little bit of a mind bend, the idea of sleeping with yourself but not masturbating.  The magic in this story, though obvious, is also so subtle that it doesn't really feel unbelievable or throw you out of the story or characters at all.  I love subtle magic that enhances the reality of the story rather than drowning it out.

The reference of the title is interesting.  Our present day director is currently in hard times mostly because of his poor decisions since he won the student film festival years back with a film that was technically ineligible.  In returning to the scene of the crime, as it were, he finds that with a little of that subtle magic going on, he's able to make things right.  But it can only happen at the expense of his younger self.  He's either going to have to betray this eager and talented young man in order to clear his adult conscience and do things the right way, or he's going to have to let the kid repeat the mistakes of his past and end up far removed from what's really important in life.

As far as professional quality, this movie is not far off from the quality of films like Love! Valor! Compassion!  or (for a ""mainstream"" comparison) A Single Man.  It is well done, all around - well written, well-acted, well filmed, and well edited.  These things don't actually take budget - budget can only polish the talent that's already there and Judas Kiss didn't need big budget for the talent involved to shine.",1321833600,4,1875,4.535714285714286
4586505,5,B00564HZYY,"Yeah, the plot turns on a bit of fantasy, or magical realism, and I don't ordinarily go for that kind of thing. But somehow, in this film, it works well. The prettiness of the actors falls right into place as a counterpoint to the dramatic plot.

Beautifully written feature. It takes the audience on a road to self-discovery and friendship.",1321747200,3,341,4.683333333333334
4586506,2,B00564HZYY,This film would have been much better if we didn't have to endure a chain smoker in the leading role. One could almost smell the stench of the cigarettes as  the  leading character  is continually  lighting cigarettes -in fact eleven during the course of the film. Whatever possessed the  makers of this film to  allow this in this day and age. I was nausiated everytime a cigarette was lit. Completely ruined the film for me.,1321747200,11,426,4.613333333333333
4586507,5,B00564HZYY,"Technically I'd rate it at about 9.5/10.

 This is a deep movie.  It touches on a lot of tough issues and asks some difficult questions.  It's about uncertainty in life.  It's about how you define success.  What really is success in the grand scheme of your life and how far are you willing to go to get it?  What are you willing to sacrifice...to give up?  More importantly what shouldn't you be willing to sacrifice?  It's a movie about relationships.  Relationships with parents, friends...lovers.  I have to thank Carlos Pedraza for his writing in this movie.  This is the kind of story that needs to be told more often in the movie industry and one that's obviously lost in big name Hollywood unfortunately.

  This movie was also a ""first"" for many of the people involved in it.  It was director J.T. Tepnapa's first big feature- obviously he did awesome!  It was Richard Harmon's first big role in a feature and not by any means an easy one.  He played Danny Reyes, one of two main characters in the film.  It was a complex role.  Reyes is a character who deep down is a good guy but the world around him has sort of pushed him into being... not the bad guy necessarily, but he definitely doesn't take the moral high ground in a lot of his choices.  Instead of doing things the right way he likes to take short cuts to get what he wants... meanwhile the audience has to understand where he's coming from and sympathize with him and Richard Harmon nailed it!  He should have a huge career ahead of him.  This is also the first significant supporting role in a feature for Sean Paul Lockhart, aka Brent Corrigan who also did really well.  I'm glad they gave him a chance in this film, he's another actor who should have a big future ahead of him.  He's just likable- you can't look at him and not like him, it's impossible, I've tried.  Timo Descamps- another first.  Apparently he's a huge star in Belgium, but this is his first movie in the US- his ""debut"" here.  The entire cast was amazing.  And the scenes between Richard Harmon and Charlie David -- Wow!

Everything in this movie just flows.  I won't say the entire movie was perfect (yes it has some nit-picky downfalls), but everything blends together perfectly.  Good acting, absolutely beautiful cinematography, great locations, and an amazing soundtrack.  The credits said the soundtrack is available on itunes but it didn't come up in the search and amazon only offers 3 of the 10 songs in the movie.  Not cool.  They really need to come out with the soundtrack.

  But anyway... this is easily the best film I've seen this year.  It's now one of my top 10 favorite movies ever, more likely in the top 5.  Everyone should watch it!  It's for anyone who has ever questioned their life- in other words, everyone.  It's amazing and ""it deserves to be seen"".

As a heads up for those who aren't familiar with this film--this is a ""gay movie"", however it is not a movie about being gay. It's a movie with romantic relationships in it just like any other film. PLEASE don't let this turn you off- watch the movie! Then you can judge! I think you will find it as amazing as I did!",1321488000,5,3140,4.483185840707964

4586509,4,B00564HZYY,"JUDAS KISS is a polished little film that successfully mixes gay issues with science fiction.  Written (with Carlos Pedraza) and directed by young J.T. Tepnapa it manages to take a dream idea and by incorporating the use of sci-fi create a story with which  almost everyone can relate. It introduces some fresh talent and allows some seasoned actors to keep the quality of the film on keel.

Zachary Well (Charlie David) is a failed filmmaker who despite a promising career in college left school to respond to the magnet of Hollywood: fifteen years later his life now is in and out of rehab and waiting tables because his dream of fame in la-la-land didn't happen.  Zach's friend Topher (Troy Fischnaller) is successful and when an emergency trip arises he asks Zach to replace him as a judge for the filmmaking class at Zach's old college. With great trepidation Zach goes back to his alma mater, is housed in the freshman dorm, visits the local gay bar and has an encounter with a student - one Danny Reyes (Richard Harmon). The next day as Zach is preparing for the judging he discovers the name of his previous night's encounter and cannot believe that Danny Reyes hnot only has Zach's previous name but also is a contestant in the film contest with a film by the same name that Zach had written and made 15 years ago. Other characters enter the scene - Chris (Sean Paul Lockhart) who is Danny's paramour but who Danny is rejecting in favor of Shane (Timo Descamps) whose parents are wealthy and are supporting the film contest; Abbey (Julia Morizawa) who is Danny's assistant; and Danny's father (Vince Valensuela). The bizarre aspect of this is that Danny Reyes not only possess Zach's name but also Danny's life and associations mirror Zach's  when he was in college.  Characters form the past and imaginary situations occur and Zach sees in Danny the opportunity to make the result of the film contest different and thus alter the destiny of Danny Reyes.

The story makes sense as a campus story but the interesting aspect of the film is the clever way in which elements of science fiction (via camera work and music and Trompe l'oeil) bring the story to a level of reconsidering the past and seeing where different actions could have possibly resulted in a more successful present.  It works and bodes well for the career of JT Tepnada.  Grady Harp, November 11",1321142400,9,2371,4.721549636803874
4586510,5,B00564HZYY,"I stumbled across the film and didn't know what to expect. I certainly didn't expect to be so enthralled. I absolutely LOVED this film. I can't even describe it as a ""gay film"". It's a film about universal themes where the characters just happen to be gay. Don't we all wish we could be given the chance to tell our younger selves that we're on the wrong path? Of course, as this film so beautifully portrays, our young selves don't want to be told what to do by some weirdo older guy who knows way too much about ourselves and seems to plotting to destroy our brilliant career. Fantastic script. Fantastic acting. Fantastic cinematography. And some wonderful twists. This film deserves to be seen by a much, much wider audience.",1320364800,6,729,4.615384615384615
4586511,5,B00564HZYY,"I was completely blown away by this film.  It was visually beautiful, with a fantastic story line that was both engaging and emotional. Charlie David -whom I absolutely love -was great in this film that I have to say was quite an interesting twist on the ""time travel"" theme. I love how this film was a film about something other than being gay. Dont get me wrong, we need as many films as possible about being gay, BUT this film was about people in a situation that anyone could have been in, but the people in this situation were gay, and for me that just made it all the more powerful, entertaining and empowering for our community. With so many films discussing situtaions from bank robberies to a future were no one ages past 24years and time is the currency, and these films all insert heterosexual characters because in most of the fictional worlds of hollywood homosexuals don't exist, it is nice to see (AGAIN) a story that is not about being gay, but the people involved in the story, the characters that make up the story just so happen to be gay.  NE Way, I am also happy to see Sean Paul Lockhart (aka) Brent Corrigan, getting roles in non-pornographic films.  I will celebrate when he shows up in a film (not only his voice, like in the film ""MILK"") with mainstream hollywood actors. I cant wait to see him in a movie along side Justin Timberlake, and Sam Worthington directed by James Cameron or Peter Jackson (OR BOTH).  He did a really good job in this film and I am convinced that he can be a Hollywood Actor along side the greats such as Johnny Depp, and Eric Bana.

This movie was quite emotionally moving. I found myself tearing up as the truth began to unfold. I will never understand how a parent can treat their own children in such an ugly way. The ending brought it all together in the grand old tradition of Happily Ever After.  GREAT FILM, I cant wait to add it to my DVD collection.",1319932800,8,1911,4.4147727272727275
4586512,5,B00564HZYY,"""Judas Kiss"" is a rather creative and ambitious story about destiny and second chances.  The main character is ""Zachary"", a 30-something failed movie director (David's character) who reluctantly agrees to help judge a film school scholarship competition at his old alma mater. Being housed in a dorm room for the festival makes this even more of a journey for Zachary, since it reminds him of all the promise and potential he showed back then, which he sold out by making some bad decisions then and since.  At a gay bar near campus, he meets a student (played by Richard Harmon) with whom he spends the night.  It's not until the next day, meeting the filmmakers, that he realizes the young man is one of the contestants.  Even stranger:  the young man's name is Danny Reyes, which is Zachary's real name, and the film he presenting is actually one that Zachary made when he went to the school.  A mysterious older man clues him in that he is somehow being given a second chance to perhaps change his life, by helping the younger version of him make better choices than he made when he was in his shoes.

Supporting, fully developed and relatable characters include Shane (Timo Descamps) a singer/artist into ""vampire"" videos who is the spoiled son of one of the school's richest benefactors, and his filming assistant Chris (Sean Paul Lockhart), and the film has a nice, original soundtrack that adds to the film, which is low budget but done remarkably well considering  I did chuckle a bit that it looks like they used an old disco ball to generate some cheap ""special effects"" in a couple of scenes). Usually, the words ""Starring Charlie David"" aren't much of a draw for me, but he is actually quite good in this role, much deeper than the usual ""hot guy"" he plays and has considerable depth and emotion.  Harmon is also excellent in his role.

Not rated, but would likely be an R due to sexual content.  ... Watch it through the end credits, as the entire cast sings a song that can't be missed!  DVD has extensive extras, including commentary, a ""making of"" feature, deleted scenes and a music video by Descamps (who apparently is a big teen idol in Belgium). May not be for everyone, but I thought it was a great effort.  Five stars out of five.",1319760000,22,2253,4.616541353383458
4586513,4,B00564HZYY,"It has been fantastic to watch J.T. Tepnapa and Carlos Pedraza's project evolve over the years and their film has turned out great! ""Judas Kiss"" is independent and low-budget, but through (mostly) excellent acting, vibrant camera work, editing, and the magical realism plot and effects, it rises above similar fare to become something I will return to often  just like I have with other gay favorites like ""Shelter"", ""Trick"", and ""Latter Days"".)

There were only a couple of flaws I find with this film. First, the roles for the women are not especially complex and are somewhat stereotypical. The women friends of gay men are simply not so narrowly defined in real life. Second, there is a wide range of acting talent on display, most of it leaning toward excellent, but some of it a tad bit rough. Still, that adds, for me at least, a sense of charm to this movie.

""Judas Kiss"" represents what I hope is a new direction for gay cinema: a variety of subject matters and new approaches to framing gay life.",1319760000,5,1007,4.677966101694915
4586514,5,B00564HZYY,"I've been following the buzz of Judas Kiss since the beginning and I finally got to view the movie. I must say it was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The story line was gripping and something most people can relate to. Who wouldn't want to get a second chance to change past deeds?

The acting was great and had a realistic flow to it.  Some known and unknown actors but overall they all brought their A game and made Judas Kiss believable with the help of the director. With any great film it starts with the writing and this movie was just amazing. The whole concept of going back in time while staying in the present to change your past was pretty amazing and I personally feel the crew pulled it off fantastically.

Doesn't matter if your gay or straight this is a movie all will enjoy. The message behind the movie is the same with any life style you live. Be true to yourself and sometimes its best to follow your heart not your head.

4586516,5,B00564HZYY,"I saw Judas Kiss at the Rhode Island International Film Festival in August, 2011.  Aside from some technical issues on the festival's part, I really enjoyed this film and am looking forward to getting my copy.  I can't help but believe that I will pick up on more symbolizm each time I watch it!  It was wonderful seeing a film from gay cinema that could hold it's own outside of the genre, in mainstream film festivals like RIIFF!

The characters were entertaining and thought provoking, and the writing made me snicker and laugh throughout while still keeping me enthralled during dramatic poignant moments.  The cinematography was georgous, rich in color and well composed.

I'm not always a fan of magical realism, as many films don't do it justice, but Judas Kiss ranks up there with Across the Universe in my mind!  Unlike the later, it was based more in reality (or perhaps alternate reality), which created a great escape without going too far outside of the boundaries as we think of them.
