Everyone should see it and share it with young people.",1431561600,7,147,4.444444444444445

6785570,5,B00P2968EQ,Very good information,1521158400,,21,6.333333333333333
6785571,2,B00P2968EQ,"Im not saying that these theories or opinions are impossible but they seem a little far fetched and misleading. I cant think my way into getting a million dollars, or will my hair to grow 6in overnight. But, I do think it has a good message In that life is short and just let things go and think positive.",1520208000,,305,4.186440677966102
6785572,5,B00P2968EQ,Brings everything together to teach you to tap into your emotions and feel them so you can  move on.  Wow.,1519516800,,106,4.25
6785573,5,B00P2968EQ,"This movie changed my life, I believe this should be watched first and then ""The Secret"" afterwards. E-motion taught me how to release my awful anxiety and other emotional issues I had and then ""The Secret"" taught me how to apply the law of attraction after you clear your negativitey. I had seen an ad for this movie and was not expecting to get anything out of it - but this movie is EVERYTHING - Im truly amazed that it literally changed me for the better.",1519084800,,459,4.348837209302325
6785574,2,B00P2968EQ,"I felt like this movie was very disconnected and disjointed. I couldn't figure out the main theme - it was all over the place. There were lots of ""experts"" telling us their opinions of how powerful the subconscious is in determining our lives and talking about some of their magic ""cures"" (like eating yellow foods or standing in the sunlight), but very little (if any) information on how to truly change the subconscious. Most of it came across as New Age b.s.  and/or a long, long infomercial for ... what exactly? I'm not sure. And I'm saying that as a Reiki healer and a woo-woo person myself! Watch ""I Am"" instead. Much better, much clearer message.",1515110400,,654,4.637931034482759
6785575,5,B00P2968EQ,I've watched this more than a couple of times and will continue to watch it.,1512864000,,76,4.133333333333334
6785576,3,B00P2968EQ,"Im all about finding ways to heal but recently I just cant stomach this stuff. Why? Take a look around. So many people on earth starving, displaced, dying needlessly from suffering that could have been prevented. What about reaching out a hand to help someone else?
what about focusing on that for a change? What does it matter if I drag myself broken through life if Im using what I have to help someone else instead of obsessing over myself and my problems. Im just kind of pissed at our head up the ass self indulgence today.",1512777600,,528,4.453608247422681
6785577,3,B00P2968EQ,This was ok. It felt like a long info commercial,1509321600,,48,3.9
6785578,5,B00P2968EQ,Very good info,1508976000,,14,4.0
6785579,5,B00P2968EQ,What an amazing and thought provoking documentary. Everyone should take a couple of hours to watch this. I watched it twice and took notes before my rental expired. Absolutely loved it!!,1507507200,,186,5.032258064516129
6785580,1,B00P2968EQ,Very shallow and simple minded.,1506902400,,31,5.4
6785581,2,B00P2968EQ,"I was initially hopeful, the trailer looked promising, I was progressively disheartened, however, as I watched; and, ultimately couldn't actually finish watching it. It is loosely cobbled together, with bits of underlying theory here and there (unattributed), a good bit of anecdotal evidence is enthusiastically pushed within the context of thinly veiled marketing and barely disguised self-promotion. I love how some of these folks so confidently arrogate to themselves the aura of the wise sage, but perhaps that's just the effect created by whoever directed the piece. There are, here and there in the documentary, some real gems of understanding and insight, but too often in the project, they are then sloppily linked to assertions, prescriptions, and recommendations that have little basis in credible evidence; or are backed up by shoddy research, full of all kinds of confounding variables. There will be plenty of devotees out there of this one and and the other, who will staunchly defend some of the tripe, but I only wrote this to help inform the potential buyer in whom a chord was struck when they saw the trailer.",1506470400,,1129,5.141304347826087
6785582,1,B00P2968EQ,"Boy, I had a tough time getting through this movie There is no real science in these folks talking (not that everything needs science, but very strong convictions without anything behind it but chatter). The pain in the body is subconscious emotional patterning that can come from trauma or trauma from your mom while in the womb or your dad being stressed while in the womb or an alien...(that alien part was mine, but the rest of that was in the movie)My feeling is that if it is subconscious than these posers in the movie can make money off desperate people that actually need real help. Can totally get behind the Taoism that they speak about throughout the movie (without actually giving credit to Taoism), but I feel like most of it is just crap that is not grounded in the reality of how modern society is. I guess if someone has not heard of emotions effecting health (panic attacks, asthma, HBP, CHD) it'd be useful and if it helps someone that's great, but I'll pass.",1504396800,7,978,4.5625
6785583,4,B00P2968EQ,Definitely informational and enlightening.,1504051200,,42,9.75

6785587,1,B00P2968EQ,"If you are science minded, you will be thoroughly disappointed. I kept watching it hoping something useful would come up. Eat foods the right color for your chakra?

6785589,5,B00P2968EQ,"This movie will open your eyes about how our emotional health affects our physical health. Must be open minded to appreciate it. Some parts are a little woo-woo, but for the most part even the most science-based skeptic will appreciate this information and the mind-body connection.",1500940800,2,282,5.1521739130434785
6785590,4,B00P2968EQ,Loved this...Only wish they had given us more ways to remove the blockages.,1499644800,,75,4.846153846153846
6785591,5,B00P2968EQ,I enjoyed this and shared it with friends.  Now I just bought myself another so they can keep passing that one around.,1499126400,,118,4.363636363636363
6785592,5,B00P2968EQ,Very insightful and well thought out movie. It speaks truth to those who care to listen. When you hear a truth spoken it resonates within. Watch this Movie several times! Will not disappoint!,1498867200,,191,4.818181818181818

In a very positive way it helps all the people in your life and those you meet everywhere you go.  At the end of the video what is most outstanding  is LOVE.  Loving yourself will guide you to do all the right things throughout your life and most important will make you a loving, healthy person,",1497916800,,450,4.506172839506172
6785596,5,B00P2968EQ,really thought provoking. I would highly recommend it to everyone.  I rented it and only wish I could have kept viewing it for a week versus 48 hours! This made science and the idea of energy and healing very accessible. I didn't find it to be too mystical or over my head.,1496534400,,273,4.25
6785597,5,B00P2968EQ,Excellent movie...if you are the type of person who wants to learn more and more about yourself. This is for you. Very Enlightening.,1496448000,,132,4.782608695652174
6785598,1,B00P2968EQ,"I laughed throughout this entire movie!  It wasn't a documentary; it was an infomercial -- a platform for the speakers with huge egos who think they alone hold the key to happiness!!  ""I've got the code,"" one of them exclaims, ""that will completely heal you of all trauma and negative emotion!""  ""Just eat this and stand in the sun,"" another proclaims, ""and your whole life will instantly turn around!""  Sure the sun feels good on our skin.  And yes, eating colorful fruits can lighten a mood temporarily.  But they aren't magic, and they can't truly create lasting change.  Any teacher or guru who tells you they have the secret to make you happy forever is lying to you!  And any teacher who tries to tell you that you shouldn't even feel negative emotions is downright dangerous.  I gained no new insights from this movie and found it a complete waste of time, except for the amusement factor ... watching these ""snake oil"" salesmen (and women) try to convince you that they hold the secret to your life!  I found that laugh-out-loud funny!",1495411200,5,1043,4.681318681318682
6785599,5,B00P2968EQ,"One of the lower star reviews stated this was to promote the presenters.  It may be that and it may also be that the presenters believe so deeply in what they do that they want it to reach as many people as possible.  And self care takes time, and there is no quick, magic way to do it.  I think it's great that you can look up the presenters and find their books and do more research and learning if you choose.  I started watching this on a day that had not been going so well.  My mood completely changed just half way through and my children and I had a great evening that was stress free.  I have incorporated much of it into my own practice and have seen such better results with my own patients when I, myself have joy and come from a place of love rather than business.",1495238400,11,777,4.078947368421052
6785600,5,B00P2968EQ,"If anyone of you could possibly help me, I grant permission. Thank you. If I am healed I will donate the rest of my life to helping heal our universe in the very same way. With heartfelt and deep gratitude .",1494374400,,207,4.073170731707317

6785603,5,B00P2968EQ,Similar to The Secret with more of a focus on health. It sends a very positive message while diving into the subconscious.,1487462400,,122,4.590909090909091
6785604,4,B00P2968EQ,It was more of a lecture film.  I did enjoy it and thought that some of the tips seemed like remembering.  I doing a trial membership on an app that will cost me per month.  I don't think I will subscribe but did enjoy this film.,1486598400,5,229,3.9347826086956523

6785638,2,B00P2968EQ,"I somehow managed to watch this to completion. I had much higher expectations, but should have realized otherwise once I saw some of the names of the people speaking as I had seen them speaking in some other videos. A significant part of this video is just ""The Secret"" repackaged. Something - which just inflates the ego and promotes a me-me-me culture. Anytime people start talking about ""The Universe"" too without being specific, I get very weary. Several of the speakers do that in this video. People use this term when they don't really understand what is going on.
It's a very nebulous term.

The video is basically just a bunch of talking heads with some animations and a ""love"" dramatization. Some of what they say is valid and enlightening for many when it comes to emotions, and if that is what it was just about, I might give this 4 stars, it's what they say you should do which gets me. The guy with the cowboy hat and arch mustache is the most annoying. He is definitely consuming way too much caffeine or some other upper -- you can hear it in his voice. He claims to not take drugs, never been to a doctor, talks about ancient wisdom, etc...yet here he is expounding the benefits of dark chocolate - which is very high in caffeine.  Caffeine is a pain reliever, but it also paralyzes our muscles over time, and contributes to adding emotional baggage - which the video is saying is no good.  Short term gain, long term pain.

The dead giveaway for the credibility of some of the speakers is to just to look at their faces. They almost all have pinnochio noses. Do you know what that means? And if they are so stress-free, why do they have so much gray hair? Why do their voices sound stressed?",1474761600,4,1708,4.464743589743589

6785665,4,B00P2968EQ,"Although there are a few places where this approaches woo woo, I think that most of us believe that its basic premise is true:  our emotions and our subconscious have a profound affect on our conscious mind, our health, and our happiness.  It did a great job showing recent studies and evidence to support the premise, but I would have liked to see more information or at least pointers to information on clearing these harmful emotions.",1464566400,13,437,4.7368421052631575

6785667,1,B00P2968EQ,"This film lost me with the inclusion of Joe Dispenza. He's a neuroscientist now? What an insult to all of the people who actually studied for 8-12 years to become REAL neuroscientists. Joe Dispensa is A CHIROPRACTOR who jumped on the new age train that started with The Secret. Even though many of the concepts presented in this film are accurate to a degree, I think it's ridiculous that these new age ""gurus"" make up qualifications for themselves and people swallow their snake oil right up and pay thousands of dollars for their workshops without questioning a thing or doing a bit of independent research.",1463184000,8,609,4.809523809523809

6785676,4,B00P2968EQ,"The subject matter is already familiar to me and I have been pursuing this line of thinking for many years.  Although the concept of ""change your emotions, change your life, "" seems simple, or to some, impossible, my personal experiences have shown me that it is not easy, but right on.  During my darkest times when I was buried in negative emotions, nothing good came to me.  Once my emotions started to return to the more positive side, my life started to change for the better.  This is a long journey, but well worth the effort.  This DVD is the reinforcement I needed to nudge me along  to a higher consciousness.",1453766400,19,619,4.531531531531532

6785679,5,B00P2968EQ,Just watch it! It is the only way to decide whether it is worth to buy the DVD... There is nothing new in there what I didn't know BUT... this 'nothing' was put and presented so nicely that literally gave my mind a spring clean :) plus an abundance of positive energy.

6785683,5,B00P2968EQ,"this was excellent. Ive been intrigued by quantum physics for some time and the power of our minds.  I wholeheartedly believe the energy we possess and around us is the key to making our lives better.  How do you do that though? Get on the wavelength that you need to be on to manifest?
Im starting to understand how and why it works and this movie helped tremendously.
If you are looking for a deeper understanding, if you find Einstein's teaching fascinating or you just want to be informed about  energy and its effects on our lives - this is an excellent starting point.
Ive watched several times already and each time I learn more and more.",1440028800,23,645,4.495726495726496

6785685,5,B00P2968EQ,"This film is incredibly intriguing to learn about how our emotions can affect our lives. It teaches us to clear our mind of all negative emotions so that we can live the happiest and healthiest life possible. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a thought provoking film that really delves in deep into how our emotions are connected to our bodies far more than we may even know. Very fascinating, and an all around great film!",1437955200,17,439,4.714285714285714

I currently use AK (applied kinesiology) already but this adds more to an explanation, even if you aren't at all into New Age or mystical healings, like I am NOT! There is a science to it, quantum physics. :)",1529798400,,274,4.5
8686168,5,B00P2968EQ,"One of my all-time favorite movies that share so many ""truths"" in our world.  It is eye-opening for some and confirmation of things they know through their own life's experiences.  I've watched this several times, renting it at first but then purchasing it so I can review it from time to time.",1528761600,,294,4.634615384615385
8686169,1,B00P2968EQ,"If they are as certain as they appear to be in the film regarding their claims about body, mind, and spirit, they should give us concrete data.  Instead of saying ""many people experienced X"", they should say ""Y number of people experienced this"".  If what they claim to be true is indeed true, they should be able to give us more precise, concrete data to support their claim.  What they are saying in the film is positive and I like it, but since they do not give us any concrete data or the sources of what they call ""scientific data"" to back up their argument, I have to say that the message of this film is highly subjective and people should watch this film with that in their mind.  Note also that none of their clients that they mention as successful examples to support their claims appears in this film.  It is not a bad film, but I suggest people who watch this keep this question in their mind as they watch it, ""That sounds really great, but how do I know if it's true?"".",1527379200,,983,4.291891891891892
