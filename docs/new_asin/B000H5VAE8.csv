8136723,4,B000H5VAE8,"Excellent primer for the beginning hockey player.  The video is well produced and concise.  The only drawback is the video segments are pretty brief and as a result, I ended up having to watch it several times to get the full impact.  I don't know of a more definitive DVD set for the novice.",1367280000,,292,4.37037037037037
8136724,5,B000H5VAE8,"The content and delivery of this set of DVD's is second to none! It's relevant for Minor Hockey candidates and adults just venturing into the sport just like me.

I would like to have seen some more slow motion breakdowns of individual elements of power skating skills to emphasise the importance of correct techniques and the downfalls of incorrect posture and positioning.

I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to develop their skills off ice and guarantee you will improve ON ICE too.",1256342400,,487,4.926829268292683
