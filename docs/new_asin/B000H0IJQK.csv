8135526,3,B000H0IJQK,"I own about ten tornado videos, and this one is not one of the better ones. It was a little boring in spots and some of the advice the commentator gave was incorrect. The storm chaser guy should have ""proof-read"" the video before releasing it.",1233532800,,243,4.4222222222222225
8135527,1,B000H0IJQK,This was a waste of money! I could have shot better footage with better verbiage.,1225324800,,81,4.466666666666667
8135528,5,B000H0IJQK,"unbelievable storm chaser footage,as someone who is somewhat obsessed with tornado footage,the Oklahoma 1999 twister was one to behold. You feel as though your riding shotgun witnessing this devastating tornado,definitely worth purchasing!!",1220745600,,240,6.53125
8135529,4,B000H0IJQK,"The footage was definitely awesome!  But it ran more like a PSA on tornado safety, which for someone like me isn't what I wanted.  I just want raw footage of chases, along with background of the storms-how the chaser picked that storm/system over others, for example.  If you can deal with a narrator saying over and over ""Jeff knew he was in danger...(etc)"" then it's a great DVD.",1220572800,,381,4.573529411764706
8135530,5,B000H0IJQK,"The footage captured on this DVD of the 1999 Moore/Oklahoma City tornado is amazing. Jeff was way to close in a couple of spots, and the viewer gets to be there too. Highly Recommended!",1212796800,,185,4.470588235294118
8135531,5,B000H0IJQK,"The thing i like the most about this dvd is the amount of awesome footage the coverage of the may 3, 1999 F-5 is spectacular. Because of the footage that this chaser gets of that tornado you can really see why they call it the billion dollar tornado.",1183939200,8,250,4.229166666666667
8135532,5,B000H0IJQK,This show gets closer to the tornado than any other and captures some amazing video of the violent storms.,1162339200,9,106,4.631578947368421
