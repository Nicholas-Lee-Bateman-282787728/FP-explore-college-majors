4239011,5,B00404GBF0,This video is very informative and alarming - pay attention people.  Islam is a radical polical entity that is working to overthrow the west.,1344297600,14,141,4.875
4239012,5,B00404GBF0,"This is a fact long being intentionally avoided to talk about simply because of the fear of terror. Terror is the most powerful weapon for Islam, a politically motivated ideology. Now it is the time for the people who care about freedom and reason to act or it will be too late.",1326844800,44,278,4.365384615384615
4239013,5,B00404GBF0,"This video graphically exposes islamic imperialism. Uasing quotes from koran, it explains the goals moslems have for non-moslems. To those who would use the argument that the quoted verses are balanced by others, I argue that the muslims believe koran is perfect. To use verses in countering others means koran is not perfect because then it can say both yes and no.
  WARNING, this should not be viewed by young people. It should, however, inspire those who see it to learn for themselves what islam teaches from its texts.",1317859200,57,524,4.876404494382022
4239014,5,B00404GBF0,"This book is well written and factual.  It covers the material you cannot learn in school, where school books completely censured the truth from students only studying American textbooks.",1367539200,3,187,5.448275862068965
4239015,3,B00404GBF0,"the mass immigration of moslems into the Western World is a threat to all of our values. That is a truth. It is a very  obvious truth but it is suppressed .this DVD opens the viewer to the threat .However,the quality of this disc is not good.",1365984000,8,242,4.148936170212766
4239016,5,B00404GBF0,"In my view this is a thoughtful, if not alarming, overview of present day events. It should be screened, and then debated, in every secondary school on Australia.",1363996800,10,162,4.821428571428571

4239018,5,B00404GBF0,"For years the world has been influenced by people who claim allegiance to a particular belief system that has conflicting reviews and interpretations.  Just as there is great disparity in the lives and beliefs among various groups that call themselves Christian, there is the ongoing divide among those espousing or being forced to live under Islamic principles, writings, and laws.  This is a great resource to include in any attempt to draw an accurate picture of the scope and source of power in that belief system.  We ignore the reach of world powers to our own peril.",1357776000,3,573,4.88659793814433
4239019,4,B00404GBF0,"Powerful message.  Excellent content, although much of the video content  was of low quality.  An introduction by Geert Wilder to introduce his video would have been helpful.  Wilders' summary was excellent!",1357516800,6,207,5.580645161290323
4239020,4,B00404GBF0,Great documentary movie. I highly recommend this product to people who don't understand the true nature teachings of Islam. A warning not only to western world but to all other democratic nations in the east.,1356134400,4,208,4.9714285714285715
4239021,4,B00404GBF0,Geert Wilders passionately and graphically exposes the dangers to individuals and cultures that are confronted by radicals bent on terror and violence.  Truth and freedom are held captive by our political leadership and the media in the West due to the threats of violence by these radicals.  This DVD does an excellent job educating Americans about the growing threat to the USA. Some of Mr Wilder's solutions are contrary to the freedoms of speech and religion we enjoy but his warnings we need to earnestly heed.,1352419200,2,515,4.976744186046512
4239022,5,B00404GBF0,"""Islam Rising"" Geert Wilders' Warning to the West."" is a great book about a very important topic of today. Geert is a Dutch politician, who wasn't afraid to speak out on what he saw as a very politically incorrect decision but a decision that he knew was the right decision for him and many other people in this world, who are afraid to speak out against Islam. Geert has paid a heavy price for his actions but I commend him for his boldness in speaking the truth about a very evil ideology, that is planning to take over the world and rule by Sharia law. They are well on their way to accomplish just that!",1351209600,12,607,4.28695652173913

8412051,5,B00404GBF0,"This documentary is actually two films in one; the film ""Islam Rising"" and the film ""Fitna"". ""Fitna"" (an Arabic word meaning upheaval [?]) is the title of a film Geert Wilders made years ago to expose the violence of Islam. He accomplished this by showing quotes from the Koran followed by news footage showing Muslims doing exactly what those Koranic quotes instructed them to do. In other words, in ""Fitna"", Geert Wilders told the truth about Islam using its own texts. For this, the Muslim religious leaders issued a fatwa (a religious ruling) calling for his death.
As a result, Geert Wilders and his family have to live under very tight 24 hour security - sleeping at different military bases every night - for the rest of their lives.
When you watch the film ""Fitna"" in this documentary, you have to keep your pause control close at hand. ""Fitna"" is in Dutch with English subtitles which show on the screen and are gone in a blink.
At intervals throughout the rest of ""Islam Rising"", information appears on the screen in white type on a black screen as a light too quickly scans/illuminates the words from left to right; while this was probably intended as a dramatic way to emphasize the importance of what was written, this over-the-top, artsy-crafty effect makes reading what is written nearly impossible and is a significant detriment to the viewer's ability to see what is written and get all the information provided.
For me, the most important part of ""Islam Rising"", second to which would be the film ""Fitna"" within it, is the speech by Geert Wilders given at the Free Speech Summit at Boca Raton, Florida which starts at 24 minutes, 40 seconds (?) into the documentary.
I have seven documentaries on Islam in my collection. Only two of them are without flaws in the information presented. ""Islam Rising"" is one of those two. The other is ""Islam: What the West Needs to Know"".
If anyone reading this has any questions, feel free to contact me; I've been studying Islam on my own since early 2007.",1399766400,2,2010,4.72934472934473
8412052,2,B00404GBF0,Not well done. The dvd seemed to be a combination of clips thrown together. But the point  they were trying to make was made.,1397692800,,125,4.208333333333333
8412053,5,B00404GBF0,"Its time to wake up people and smell the roses because Islam is wining and Democracy is losing. You won't like what Sharia has to offer especially if your head is rolling down the street. Man, its BAD! The video is very informative. One needs to watch it!
