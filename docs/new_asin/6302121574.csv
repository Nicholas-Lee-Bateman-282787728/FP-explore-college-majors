7821346,3,6302121574,"Constant Distraction  and apparent lack of respect for performers by non-playing crew on stage ruin the concert. -- Looks more like a rehearsal than concert. Songs are fine. Performers do their part well. But video is very hard to watch because of UNNECESSARY constant stage-crew activity - talking among themselves- walking across stage - total disrespect behind performers. - Makes a better ""listening"" concert than ""viewing"" concert.",1250380800,3,436,5.507462686567164

If you want to see and hear how they looked and played in the late sevenities or early eighties, then this is a good video to watch. On here they play ""My home's in Alabama, Why lady why, Tennessee River, Salty dog, and Tulsa time"".",1108944000,,322,4.383333333333334
