1879705,5,B000096IBI,"Modern Times (1936), Charlie Chaplin is the master of comedy! This film really brought the heart and soul! I love this film a lot because of Chaplin's return of The Tramp, It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I'm so glad I bought this film it's really entertaining!

1879709,5,B000096IBI,"It is wonderful to view a silent film by one of the master craftsmen who understood and practiced the fine art of telling a touching story with moving images alone. (OK, a few title cards also; but, the greatest used the fewest) Watch enough Chaplin and you will finally understand what film critics mean when they suggest that we lost an entire art form when we added sound to our movies. This film and his 'City Lights' will convince any true film lover that Chaplin was one of the greatest.",1492128000,,493,4.488888888888889
1879710,5,B000096IBI,"This is a classic full length film. Although old, it is very clear.
I think that most people will enjoy this film even though it is 80 years old, not because it is 80 years old or because a master Charlie Chaplin wrote and directed the film, wrote the music, but because he offers us a wonderful fun-filled performance. It is about a time when there were few jobs available and many could not get work and starved.
Charlie is a bumbling man who tries all kinds of jobs and is unable to do them. How he tries and how he fails is fun to watch. And how he finally succeeds and what he succeeds in is very satisfying.
This is the first Charlie Chaplain film that I saw. I will try to see more of them.",1490486400,,697,4.094890510948905

1879722,5,B000096IBI,"Charlie Chaplin invented many of the modern techniques used in comedy today. When you see this, think Stephen Colbert. I think, after seeing this, he draws a lot of his inspiration from this great character. This film was written at the time when ""talkies"", or films with dialogue, were first being released. Using no on-screen dialogue (the only audible dialogue is through intercoms of radios), Chaplin makes a statement about the new wave of Talkies. Chaplin vowed that his character, ""Tramp"" (the main character in this film), would never speak a word in a film. The rise of talkies made it clear it was time to retire this character, so he saw this movie as the perfect opportunity to do so. Get ready to roll on the floor, laughing. Get ready for one of the most emotionally complex comedies ever made. Enjoy!",1474243200,,815,4.746478873239437

1879811,5,B000096IBI,"I enjoy watching it. It's beautiful, funny, and moving. The movie is about the struggle to survive in an industrial world. I love it. One of the scenes I love is when the tramp gives up his seat for the lady. Maybe he was simply practicing his custom (Victorian era), but it was a nice thing to do. Very few people do it these days. When she started crying, he gave her his handkerchief. He also let her sleep, tucked her in, and promised to wake her up before the store opened. He looked out for her, which made him a wonderful gentleman, but these aren't the only good scenes. This movie is highly recommended to all.",1416614400,,619,4.299145299145299

1879832,4,B000096IBI,"Some of the gags were funny, but I really found his movie ""City Lights"" more amusing.  Also, ""The Great Dictator"" was absolutely fabulous.  Some of the scenes with Hitler and Mussolini were hysterical.  Much of it was serious, however, and the speech, which Chaplin delivers at the end about man's humanity to man is unforgettable.  Many say it doesn't fit in with a comedy, but I absolutely thought it did.  Modern Times is worth watching, however.",1414022400,,449,4.855263157894737

1879841,4,B000096IBI,"The movie ""Modern Times"" is a commentary on the Great Depression's affect on the working class of America, as well as a statement about a silent filmmaker searching for his way in a Hollywood jungle that had embraced talking pictures. Chaplin's film masterfully captures that sense of struggle and hopelessness as he must have felt the tide of time rising against him.

The final scene in this movie is simply timeless, as our hero and his girl walk off into the sunset, which is the unknown. Chaplin the filmmaker was doing the same.

I give this film four instead of five stars because I feel the constant gag throwing at the audience gets a bit tiresome three quarters of the way through the picture. Still, this is a truly pleasant film worth viewing for anyone who loves movies.",1407542400,,783,4.666666666666667

1879848,5,B000096IBI,"Chaplin's little tramp character at his best as an ""everyman"" factory worker struggling to retain his humanity in a mechanized, capitalistic world.  Along the way he struggles with the giant machines, inhumane bosses, Socialist revolutionaries, and unemployment, as his every effort to be humane and helpful goes wrong or is mistaken for something sinister. Paulette Goddard is equally entrancing as the ""gamin"" who pairs up with Chaplin on a quest for the American Dream. Made in the era of talkies, Modern Times is a ""silent"" film, but includes just the right sound effects, and the famous ""Chaplin sings"" scene. The extras include home movies featuring Chaplin and Paulette Goddard, and some recreations of the special effects. Chaplin was secretive about his methods, so these would be very interesting to any film buff.",1395532800,,824,5.242424242424242

1879860,5,B000096IBI,"Theres something ironic about watching a film called Modern Times in 2013, when it was in fact filmed nearly 80 years ago (and for us its an odd choice for our first Chaplin film, come to think of it). Its also ironic that it was still a silent film, despite talking movies having already been around for 10 years. But the film is still an amazing piece of social commentary, combining strong social and political commentary around the central theme of humanity, and giving a last hurrah for Chaplins Little Tramp character, who is retired here (although the Jewish barber from Chaplins next film, The Great Dictator, is basically the same character), fading into the sunset, having for the first time been heard as well as seen (in the films famous nonsense song  Lo Daniderffs comical song Je cherche aprs Titine, which Chaplin sings in jibberish  we still don't truly hear him talking). But with this film, Chaplin was indeed getting with the times, and it was his last true silent film  his next film, The Great Dictator, was a transition film in that it was a talkie, but it was also spoken largely in jibberish (he probably still wasn't comfortable with the idea of being judged as a proper talking actor and competing with the likes of Orson Welles and Clark Gable). His final four films were all talkies.

Chaplin made the film after taking an unprecedented five years off between his previous film (City Lights) and this one. During that time he travelled the world, meeting Mahatma Ghandi, Albert Einstein and HG Wells and putting together big ideas, which resulted in the development of economic theories that shared concepts with communism, all ideas that came from sympathies and associations with controversial thinkers and which would land him in hot water later in life (in 1957 he was barred from re-entry in the US, his new film Limelight was suppressed, and he lived the rest of his life outside of the US, rarely ever to return, despite having made his career and fortune there, setting up companies and employing thousands).

The film starts off with an interesting scene of workers being hoarded into the factories, followed quickly of a scene of sheep being hoarded from one pen into another (and, if we look carefully, we see a black sheep among them, ha ha ha), before the entrance of the Little Tramp, on his way to work. The film has three distinct areas:
- working in the factory
- in and out of jail
- love

The film takes on several themes, including drug use (cocaine), the inhumanity of the industrial age, police discrimination and other post-Depression era brutality, wage slavery and inhumanity, all of which can be overcome by indomitable free spiritedness. Yay! By the end of the movie, there is no more steam for social commentary, though, and the tale revolves around the Little Tramp and his new girlfriend, the gamine (which, by the way, means a girl with mischievous or boyish charm  not a commonly-used word any more, I had to look it up!). This is where we get the amazing blind roller skating scene, as well as the beautiful and hilarious nonsense song. The gamine, of course, is played by Paulette Goddard, Chaplins off-screen lover at the time as well, and they go off into the sunset together to live happily ever after, apparently forgetting the Gamines two younger sisters, whom she had been supporting early in the film before the death of their father.

The scenes and stunts are hilarious beginning to end, and we could hardly stop laughing scene after scene. Chaplin was a real genius of physical comedy. I can hardly describe the hilarity any more than I already have, it just needs to be seen to be believed.

The bonus features are great, and theres probably as much bonus material as there is original film!

A 30-minute documentary explains how Chaplin was living in an era of mass unemployment and the rise of industrialization. He did an 18-month tour of the world, where he was horrified by the rise of nationalism in Europe, while at the same time developing economic theories of redistributing both wealth and work. It mentions, and shows stills from, the original ending, which showed the Little Tramp going off into the sunset alone after the gamine enters a convent to become a nun (?!?!). We learn that talking films had been around for a decade, but Chaplin still wasn't ready to do one, although he had developed a talking script that was later abandoned. This film marks the only time that the Little Tramps voice is heard, although Chaplins voice had been heard by the public speaking in German in Vienna into a short recording device. Modern Times was the last great silent film to come out of Hollywood. As bonus materials we also look over the shoulder of Philippe Truffault and Jean-Pierre Dardenne as they discuss the film. They note that theres always food in Chaplins films, and how the film is a documentary of the times, going all the way to the shack and shanty-town. Industrialisation had brought the cost of a Model T Ford down to $300 from $850, but there were social growing pains. And while voices can be heard speaking in the film in parts, they are always through a machine of sorts  a recording device, in the case of the hilarious feeding machine demonstration (theres that sheep-herding thing again), a security screen, an intercom. We see a great outtake of Chaplin interacting with a stern traffic cop at one road crossing. We see the cool opening animation of TOBIS studio, with the rooster crapping out the I into TOB S (who came up with this stuff?? The sample here shows a later version of the same thing, with the roosters egg forming the I  since when do roosters lay eggs?). Great photo collections show the factory, from jail to paradise, factories re-open, back again, outtakes from the department store silverware robbery scene, soldiers, the gamines nun scene), set and production sketches and photos, search for locations, and Paulette Goddards publicity shots. There are also several documentaries: Behind The Scenes In The Machine Age (1931), Symphony In F (1940), Liberaces Smile (1956) which was based on Chaplins score for the film, and For The First Time (1967).

Behind The Scenes In The Machine Age is a film created by the Department of Labor of the US government showing how industrialisation has robbed men and women of jobs, how it has created labour efficiencies, and how job efficiencies still need to be created, even as the enforcement of good conditions for workers is being promoted. Women, Waste, Bureau, Jobs, Rhymes, Silk Hose, Lollipops, Crackers, Cereals, Bandages, Sheets, Book, Typewriters, Cigars, Cushions, Telephones, Track. It goes on in silence for over 42 minutes. Printing  the hand press versus the mechanical press. Scenes of women working silk hose machines from roller machines, loading 1931 boxes of Mars bars, wrapping lollipops, packing 1931 boxes of Corn Flakes!! Shows entire production process!! Shows girls building books, folio by folio. Automatic typewriters. Symphony In F shows the production of a car, from the arrival of crude rubber to the creation of tires to the production of a car, with a special event showing the creation of the 28 millionth Ford. The V8 mark turns into a weird little animated V8 boy. For The First Time, in 1967, is a Cuban documentary that shows a mobile film crew taking their mobile movie experience into the mountains to show some people their first film  which is Modern Times. Wow!! Theres a cool surf guitar intro, we meet the passionate projectionists, and then we meet the villagers. I have no hobbies, I never go out. Theres no place to go, nothing to do.

1879864,5,B000096IBI,"Modern Times is probably one of the most recognized silent films of all time.  Funny thing is, its not really a silent film.  It has many of the major elements of the silent film era, but this movie was released in 1936, several years after talkies were invented.  Sure, its in black and white, the characters don't talk to each other, and Charlie Chaplin reprises his most famous character, ""The Little Tramp"", for the third and final time, but there are small sound parts. This was Chaplin's way of poking fun at talking pictures.

To the casual observer, this could be just a funny little story about an average guy (Chaplin), whose heart is in the right place, yet he  doesn't seem to catch a break no matter where he goes or how hard he tries, and a young orphan girl (Paulette Goddard) who steals a loaf of bread and the little tramps heart all at the same time.  But there is a dark side to this film, and if it wasn't for Chaplin's genius in physical comedy and satire, the film could have ended up too bleak to really be entertaining.

The movie is about two people who are trying make it in a world where all the odds seemed to be stacked against them.  The music, written by Chaplin is very poignant.  Here we hear the song, ""Smile"".  As it is playing, you begin to hear the lyrics in your head.  (""Smile though your heart is aching; Smile even though its breaking;) In spite of all the grey shaded areas, ""Modern Times"" is a story of hope; hope that can beat down despair. It is a genuine classic that deserves its position in film history.",1378339200,,1552,4.372822299651568

1879868,5,B000096IBI,"Arguably the first great superstar of film, Charlie Chaplin was the man known simply as the Tramp in his silent movies. For this reason Modern Times seems like the perfect bridge between the early silent era and the age of talkies starting in the late 1920s. Chaplin had many successes earlier including The Gold Rush (1926) and City Lights (1931). However, people wanted to hear talking and soon enough everyone would have to make the transition or else die out. Because of Chaplin's popularity he was able to make one last great silent picture. From that point on however it got a lot louder in theaters. In this film the iconic Tramp character finds himself up against modern technology and the Great Depression. The whole movie seems to be critiquing factories, the police, the economy, and even modern film by using little actual dialogue. With that being said, this is a great film which exhibits everything that made Chaplin famous. He still has that walk, that mustache, and new hilarious antics to accompany everything else. Yet again there is a love story, between a tramp and a beautiful homeless girl played by Paulette Goddard (Only in the movies). Despite all the hardships they face this resilient pair amazingly still have hope. Fittingly, in the end the two lovebirds walk off into the background, seeming to bring the end of the Chaplin golden era, but also leaving us with a feeling of hope for the future.",1370044800,,1425,4.820408163265306

1879871,5,B000096IBI,"I would imagine that if you're here, you already know what an excellent film Modern Times is, and don't need to be convinced of its greatness. Chaplin achieves that rare mix of brutal satire and sweet, affectionate filmmaking that helps this film maintain its relevance almost eighty years later. More than any of his other movies, Modern Times represents for me the broadest swath of Chaplin's genius, having written, directed, produced, starred in, and composed the score for it. And if you can sit through this movie without falling in love with Paulette Goddard, see a doctor. You may be dead.

The transfer is close to flawless. There's some artificial (I'm assuming it's digitally added; it looks odd) grain near the beginning that sticks out like a sore, grainy thumb. But either it only lasts that one scene or I quickly acclimated to it - though I suspect the former, as I still haven't noticed it on repeat viewings. There doesn't appear to be this astonishing restoration as there is for many classic Criterion titles, because the film seems to have survived in excellent shape - when TCM airs it, their version is nearly this good.

1879880,5,B000096IBI,"People often say that we have lost Christ, we have lost Mary. Living in the 21st century, I am, perhaps, more concerned that we have lost Chaplin`s Tramp.

Easter is not Mel Gibson's blood-soaked sadism posed as religious dogma. Rather, it's Fred Astaire and Judy Garland strolling down an Easter Parade. Christmas is not Cecil B. DeMille pious kitsch. Christmas is personified by the Little Tramp trying to find existential depth in an increasingly plasticized, dumbed-down modern Western world. Indeed, there may be a bit of poetic irony in Charles Chaplin's exiting this mortal coil on Christmas day itself, in 1977.

Chaplin was not a religious man. Yet, his Tramp is the most religious and iconic figure in all of cinema. Chaplin seemed to be partly aware of this. The late film historian Leslie Halliwell reported that when Cecil B. DeMille was casting for The King of Kings (1927), Chaplin approached DeMille, offering to play the role of Christ: ""I am Jewish, I am an atheist, and I am a comedian. I would be prefect for the part because I could play it totally objective."" DeMille had Chaplin thrown out of his office. Although Chaplin was probably right in that assessment, we can be grateful that DeMille rejected the casting. King of Kings may be one of the worst examples of  1920s Hollywood. Of course, Chaplin exaggerated his beliefs in the interest of self-promotion. He was not Jewish and his atheism is debatable. The clown was, predominantly, anti-clerical.

With the first talkie, The Jazz Singer (1927), silent cinema was history. Someone forgot to tell Chaplin. He was still making silent films nearly a decade later. Many commentators have noted Modern Times (1936) is anything but modern. This film was a last, in many respects, for Chaplin: his last silent film and the final indisputable appearance of the Tramp. (There is a debate over whether Chaplin's Barber from 1940s The Great Dictator was really the Tramp, or not).

Modern Times, originally titled ""The Masses,"" is not completely silent. The Factory task master talks through a Orwellian screen. The Billows feeding machine speaks through a ""pre-recorded device."" Chaplin sings a gibberish song near the finale.  However, these do not add up to a ""talkie."" Rather, it adds up to a silent with clever, carefully chosen, cartoonish sound effects.

As a social commentary, Modern Times is derivative, borrowing from Fritz Lang, among others. As a romantic comedy, it's also derivative, recycling numerous gags and plot elements from Chaplin's Mutual shorts. It has, rightly, been pointed out that Modern Times is like a feature-length compendium of those shorts. However, the screen presences of Chaplin and Paulette Goddard are imbued with such authentic personalities that it somehow seems fresh.

In Run to the Mountain, the Trappist monk Thomas Merton wrote of Modern Times:

""I saw Modern Times, everybody in the theater was laughing. I don't remember when lately I have been in a theater where everybody laughed together so spontaneously as over this three or four years old Chaplin picture. It feels that anything that ever had any happiness about civilization-all the happy things that civilization has produced like Chaplin movies, are all gone and done with. Nothing left but the wars. The West Wall. The Maginot line. The bombers: bombers are our only shining things. Christ have mercy on us. God save you, Mary full of grace.""

Chaplin's Tramp, as a screen persona, has emotional resonance in his reflections and labors, inspired by his intimate intertwining and quintessential recognition with the Gamin (Goddard). His Tramp is the socially devalued of the Beatitudes. A misfit in respectable society, he embodies that blistering critique of status-quo avarice, lucidly penned in the Letter of James. The Factory Worker and Gamin are the faces of Them: ""Let Them die in the streets before giving Them health care.""

The title credits face-off with a monstrous, eschatological clock: Futurism's icon beckoning the 6 a.m. call for America's workforce. A title reads: ""Modern Times. A story of industry, of individual enterprise--humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness."" Pursuit does not equate attainment, as lambs herded through a chute remind us with brass knuckle subtlety. Charlie's Oedipal fragility, juxtaposed against perpetually bleak industry, sets the absurdist tone. Only an artisan of Chaplin's caliber could credibly render such meek conceit. Fortunately, Chaplin (along with Montgomery Clift) was probably the greatest actor of American cinema, which is why he wholly convinces, securing audience empathy.

The Factory President reads Tarzan funny papers, clips his nails, plays with jigsaw puzzles, bellows, and swivels his chair to catch sight of the Little Fellow trying to sneak off for a ""smokin' in the boy's room"" break. Robbed of his much-needed cigarette, tightening nuts, tightening nuts, tightening nuts, victim of a mechanical salesman feeding him nuts, feeding him, feeding him nuts: Charlie loses it! Wrenching his hands, he attempts to take his pain to the nipple, much to the outright horror of two unwilling ladies. The Tramp is, indeed, a lost icon in the padded cell.

Enter the Fellow's fellow traveler, the Gamin, adorned in hip-hugging, clingy rags. Orphaned and on the run, she seeks to claim the promise of the New World. Banana in hand, knife clenched in her teeth like a cocky Captain Blood, she stands, with legs apart, barefoot and defiant, as an overtly sexual woman: a refreshing change of pace (and rarity) for a Chaplin leading lady (which were normally of the child bride variety). The Gamin's ""Jean Valjean"" moment of shame and glory arrives, tucked in a loaf of stolen bread.

Now this Eve will meet her Adam, her soul mate, the Tramp. He will belatedly see the waif as a gift of wisdom. Through a series of strung-together short film vignettes, they will embark on a seemingly ill-fated pursuit of the paradisiacal hour.

Modern Times is deceptively simplistic. Such simplicity is personified in the suburban comic strip-like vignette of ""let's play house."" The faade is as ""stuck"" as Charlie in the clogs of machinery (filmmakers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne shrewdly compared the latter famous sequence to Chaplin's image being run through a film projector.)

For the most part, the Tramp is a degree more detached here than he was in previous features, which serves him well. The film does have a mawkish ""buckle up-never say die"" moment of the type that Chaplin will take to maudlin extremes in Limelight (1952). However, this is washed aside by a sublime finale of Gamin and Tramp locked arm-in arm. Having met his equal, the Tramp has evolved. Whether the two reach the sunset horizon together or not is of little concern. They are frozen only where we require them to be.

This Criterion Collection edition of the film is, naturally, exemplary. A detailed booklet (featuring essays by Saul Austerlitz and Lisa Stein), an audio commentary by Chaplin biographer David Robinson, three short films, deleted scenes, and an interview with David Raskin (the arranger of Chaplin's picturesque composition ""Smile"") are among the wealth of extras.

Chaplin ends up with a nervous breakdown, unable to stop performing the repetitive motions of his job even when not on the line.

1879886,5,B000096IBI,"""Modern Times"" balances humor and pathos extremely well. For Chaplin, this was his opportunity to criticize authority and progress in the modern industrialized world with its automation and the assembly line, socially elite top management so greedy and mean spirited that two-way television monitors are installed in company bathrooms to keep employees moving and even the advent of talking pictures. Not a minute of the film is wasted; the editing is perfect--I didn't get bored once. In fact, I laughed quite a bit. This is, perhaps, Chaplin's funniest film and easily one of his very best. Chaplin and then-wife Paulette Goddard star in this film and although there is a musical score Paulette Goddard never speaks and Chaplin sings a song in mere gibberish near the end to make fun of talking pictures. Indeed, any talking is done by machines. For example, we hear a phonograph playing a record introducing an employee ""feeding machine"" which will end the need for any employee lunch breaks, the radio in the jailer's office allows one to hear speech and when the steel factory boss talks it is only through his two-way televised monitoring system that his words can be heard.

Chaplin plays ""The Little Tramp"" character; he is an assembly line worker in a steel mill factory who must tighten bolts faster than anyone ever could. When Chaplin fails to keep up he gets dragged onto the actual assembly line and literally becomes a cog in a wheel! He also faces a test when he has to try out an employee ""feeding machine"" that doesn't work very well. Chaplin's character eventually goes crazy from the stress and spends time in a hospital to recuperate; he then alternates between disastrous jobs in a modernized world and jail where he is protected from that world although he also begins a sweet romantic relationship with a young homeless women played by Paulette Goddard. The gamin's father has been murdered by a crowd and her younger sisters have been taken away by juvenile officers; this has a terrible impact on her especially since she has a kind and sensitive heart.

There's a good deal more that I could tell you but I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that there are quite a few humorous scenes including one with Chaplin as a night watchman in a department store who puts on blindfolds to roller-skate, never realizing that he's skating incredibly close to a deep hole in the floor that would have killed him had he fallen into it!

It also strikes me as very interesting that the only two people in the film who are truly humane--and human beings--are the nameless Little Tramp and his girlfriend; although they are ""low on the totem pole"" and unable to fit into modern society I was rooting hard for them! They represent a type of humanity that has been lost in Chaplin's ""Modern Times.""

The second DVD has many extra features on it; and they're all good. I particularly liked the documentary entitled ""Chaplin Today: Modern Times;"" the two deleted scenes which include Chaplin's entire nonsense song; ""Behind the Scenes in the Machine Age"" and the short documentary footage of some very poor Cubans watching their first movie, ""Modern Times.""

""Modern Times"" is one of the best films I've ever seen. Charles Chaplin is at his best here and Paulette Goddard makes a wonderful leading actress. I highly recommend this film for Chaplin fans; newcomers to Chaplin's movies; comedies that mix humor with social and political messages and classic silent films with both comedy and tragedy.",1340064000,,3520,4.850249584026622

1879889,4,B000096IBI,"Charlie Chaplin was the master of physical situation comedy back then, because talkies (films with dialogue and speech) hasn't quite taken off yet, so activity was the theme of the comedy. Charlie Chaplin's repetitious twitch from tightening two screws over and over from the production line in the factory was just priceless.

But, what really made this film important for me to own was having the beautiful Paulette Goddard as the Gamin (what does that mean anyway?).  Even without words, her presence on film came off strong and dominating.  Without her, this film would definitely show signs of something more missing because she added platonic romance and excitement to the film as Charlie Chaplin provided the comedy.

And this film definitely reflects a future beyond the initial year this film was made.  Perhaps not to us, (the current film viewer), but to the audiences of 1936, this film may appear to have been about 50 years ahead of it's time.  I wonder if anyone else caught that.

Anyway, I saw this film on cable TV about 30 years ago, and so I do remember that I thought that it was way ahead of it's time for being filmed in 1936.  I never bothered to consider that the film may be worthy to own on VHS back then, but when I saw that the Criterion Collection has allowed this film to grace its large unique collection on Blu-ray, I knew that I would want to have it now.

Yes, with Paulette Goddard with her greasy hair, and dirty black dress, and her beautiful eyes and her lovely smile, I cherish this movie all the more.  This is definitely a keeper on Blu-Ray.",1332633600,,1583,4.601423487544484
1879890,5,B000096IBI,"A couple years back, in 7th grade, during History class, everyone in the classroom was introduced to one of entertainment's greatest stars, Charlie Chaplin. And how did we become aware of this man's works? By watching Modern Times. After watching the movie, I must say that it is one of the FUNNIEST movies I've EVER seen in my life! In fact, I think I've gotten the most enjoyment out of the film than anyone else in the classroom. Why haven't I seen this earlier?

Honestly, I don't think there's a lot that I can say that hasn't been said already, but I still highly recommend this movie. Not only is it extremely wonderful and hilarious, but it is also one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen, too. Think about it: Can we students imagine what the 1930s were like, let alone Little Tramp's world? It would be pretty bizarre to visualize ourselves force-fed by a ""feeding machine"", as well as TRY to get arrested by doing ridiculous things!

1879894,5,B000096IBI,"I have never been much of a Charlie Chaplin fan--and I haven't seen that many of his movies, for that matter.  This movie is the work of a genius.  It is so clever and original and unique: the ""events"" of the ""story,"" his facial expressions and his physical genius, not to mention that he is credited with writing the music!  I especially love the ""feeding machine"" at the factory; his dance after he leaves the production line at the factory and the other dance he does when he is the entertainer at the nightclub--where did he get those ""moves?""  I also love the whole sequence when he returns to work as the assistant to the man who is to fix the idled factory equipment:  his interactions with his ""boss"" and his time inside the cogs of the machinery (there are actually 2 different sequences inside the cogs of the machinery:  one time it is Charlie who is inside and the other time it is his boss who is inside).  Also the sequence where he is a waiter in the night club trying to serve the customer his wine and duck are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay beyond clever.  With the piece de resistance being his ""song"" at the nightclub.  All of this interspersed with pathos and ""social commentary"" on factory work and ""the changing times"" and people struggling to ""make it in the world.""  This film is more than a gem.  I enjoy watching it over and over.",1324252800,,1354,4.508196721311475

1879898,5,B000096IBI,"Charlie Chaplin's last semi-silent picture, and his final appearance as the little tramp. It's also a not-so-subtle critique of the change in America's popular attitude during his professional heyday, decrying the abundance of automation in local factories while the great depression still raged on city streets. Despite the weighty deeper implications, it remains a genuinely charming set of skits and Chaplin is at his emotive, expressive best from curtain to curtain. The film gets bonus points for throwing its star into so many unique, visually spectacular situations, including what's probably his signature scene inside the belly of a giant, mechanical assembly line.",1311465600,,674,5.617647058823529
1879899,5,B000096IBI,"This is one of Chaplin's best movies!  The scene when Charlie is working at an assembly line is one of the most classic and most hilarious of all time.  It's a must see, not only for the humor, but also for its message of social criticism.  It questions what modernity contributes to the worker who has little time to do anything other than work in order to feed himself and his family - as opposed to what the worker does for the industrialist.  It's a clear criticism of Chaplin's time and the Great Depression era in the U.S.  However, with global competition at its highest in our day, the movie also has a message for us.  In either case, it is still a great comedy for young and old.  Great show.",1309910400,,702,4.312977099236641

The transfer is indeed unbelievably beautiful.  Audio is great, too.  Only quibble I have is that Criterion used Chaplin's 1954 cut, in which he edited the Tramp's song.  The complete song footage is included as a supplement, but it would have been good to have seen the movie without the edit, which today seems illogical. Chaplin was a fantastic actor, comedian, composer, writer, and sometimes director, but I question some of his choices as film editor.  I hope subsequent Chaplin releases by Criterion will give us the option of watching the complete original theatrical cuts.  Owners of the older David Shepard-produced Chaplin releases on Image DVD will want to hang onto them.  Owners of the Chaplin films on Warner DVD will be ready to ditch them.",1306972800,,1038,6.117241379310345

I tried very hard but I could hardly find any picture imperfections taking into account the fact that this is a 75-year old film.  The special features are also very good as is usual for a Criterion release.

I have watched this film a few times and I never tire of watching it.  There are just too many excellent sequences to mention and so you'll have to watch it yourself to truly appreciate the genius of Chaplin.  Chaplin himself preferred ""The Gold Rush"" as his personal favourite film which is also a classic and while ""City Lights"" is also very good ""Modern Times"" for me is still overall his best silent film.  Like Lang before him in ""Metropolis"" Chaplin shows how technology and innovation can only be helpful to humanity if compassion and common sense is used.  Otherwise man becomes a slave to the machine instead of the other way around.

This is one of the best movies of all time and like any classic, I find myself enjoying it more every time I watch it.  Excellent picture and sound quality, great bonus features and excellent content makes this an easy review.

However, seeing it on Blu-ray is an incredible experience.  Sharp, crystal clear, as if one could reach in and actually touch the characters on the screen.  I have always loved classic films and it never occured to me how great B&W movies could look in high definition.  It is so sharp that even the film grain can be seen.  Back during the early 80's I owned a Super 8 film print of Modern Times that had cost me over $200.00.  Without hesitation I can say my film print pales in comparison to this Blu-ray dvd.

1879904,5,B000096IBI,"I have the Criterion Blu Ray version of Modern Times now and it's the best copy yet of this film.

I found that all films from that previous DVD collection seemed to be cranked up too fast!  I won't go into the plot of the film.  I'll leave that to the other reviewers.  If you have the VHS and/or that previous DVD of Modern times and have a Blu Ray player, I recommend you get this Criterion Blu Ray copy.  It's worth the purchase!

It's rather shameful that this isn't noted on the packaging. If that's is the version you prefer, than you'll be happy. The restoration is lovely, and most of the edited parts are available as bonus features.

1879906,5,B000096IBI,"Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times is one of my favourite films and arguably one of the best films ever made. The movie remains incredibly funny while also managing to be a significant artistic achievement  in cinema design and social commentary. For Chaplin fans, it marks the last appearance of his ""little tramp"" character and, not coincidentally, his last film without full synchronized sound.  The film does include music, sound effects, and the occasional voice, including a segment at the end where we get to hear the tramp sing a short nonsense song. However, as a film released 10 years into the sound movie era, the film is also something of an enigma. It presents perhaps the most famous silent film character in a film that purports to be silent, yet it features futuristic  factory machinery (reminiscent of Metropolis) and large close-circuit flat screen video displays that would have looked almost like science fiction back in the 1930's.

This new Blu-ray release from Criterion continues their standard of releasing historically important films with significant audio/video remastering and a variety of enticing special features. However, in this case, Criterion is competing with an already excellent release of this film on DVD from Warner/mk2 in 2003. The new Criterion release mentions that the ""new"" transfer was created in collaboration with Cineteca di Bologna, who were also credited with the previous Warner/mk2 release. I am not sure if this release actually includes a new transfer or just an upgrade of the existing one to 2K-resolution for Blu-ray. I performed a side-by-side comparison of both versions, and the Criterion Blu-ray version contained noticeably better detail and superior contrast. However, it also contained a great deal more digital grain that I found a little distracting at first. This can easily be seen in the opening frames where the clock face that seemed so steady on the old DVD version now has a multitude of dancing pixels that give it a strange shimmering quality. As the film progressed, I became accustomed to the new graininess of the image and began to appreciate the increased detail. For the first time, I could see some of the horizontal wires used to secretly operate the ""feeding machine"" in the second chapter. Chaplin's face also looked a little older throughout. The old Warner/mk2 DVD version looked softer and textures, including faces, had a much smoother feel to them. I did notice some extra grit and fibres showing near the edges of the frame in the Criterion version that were absent from the Warner/mk2 DVD, so this does suggest that the transfer or at least processing of the transfer is different. Overall, I preferred the more detailed Criterion version but still think that a better compromise between the two could be reached with some more processing and cleanup of artefacts done to the Criterion version.

Sound quality for both versions was similar with a slight nod going to the lossless Criterion mono version. The old DVD also includes a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack absent from the Criterion version. This is not really worth the effort for a film with 1936 sound technology.

As far as special features go, the Criterion version really shines. It adds a new and informative commentary by Chaplin biographer, David Robinson. The old DVD included only a six-minute introduction by Robinson. Other features from the old DVD are also carried through to the Criterion Blu-ray. These include the 26-minute ""Chaplin Today - Modern Times"" featurette, two deleted scenes of very minor importance, some theatrical trailers, and a 10-minute Cuban documentary about peasants seeing Modern Times as their first movie experience. The old DVD includes some additional materials that are not included on the new Blu-ray such as photo/poster galleries, plus some vintage featurettes from the US government and Ford motor company related to assembly line labour, and a performance of ""Smile"" by Liberace. None of these is a major loss.

New to the Criterion version are two excellent ""visual essays"" which are essentially  a series of stills (many from the galleries on the old DVD) with substantial and informative commentaries by two Chaplin historians related to the making of the film and the locations used. There is also a very interesting new featurette about the visual and sound effects used in the film. It includes some fascinating explanations of effect shots presented in the film, although their very detailed explanation of a glass matte shot used in the roller skating scene does not seem to take into account that the camera moves during the sequence.

Also included is a very interesting interview with music arranger, David Raskin, taken from an old Laserdisc version of the film. I was glad to be able to see this again. Finally, an old Chaplin short, ""The Rink"", and a home movie with Alistair Cooke, ""All at Sea"", are included. These are available elsewhere but are presented here in superior quality (the former) or with an additional interview (the latter) not available elsewhere.

Criterion also includes a nice 36-page black and white printed booklet with chapter stops, cast and credits, plus two informative historical essays.

Overall, I think this is a nice package. The film presentation is more detailed than it has ever been in any previous release, although some additional digital manipulation of the picture and cleanup of artefacts would be welcomed by my eyes. The bonus features are extensive and interesting, although I would like to have seen more of the image galleries (including stills, script elements, publicity and financial material) that have been included, albeit at much lower resolution, on previous DVD and Laserdisc versions. My only gripe with the bonus materials is that both on disk and in print they refer to poor or at least ""diminished"" box office performance of the film because it did not have full sound. All vintage box office information I have seen related to the film indicate that it was one of the top five grossing films of the year.

The Blu-ray is a remarkable transfer considering this film is close to 75 years old and a very worthy addition to any collection. At the end I was left to ponder this: How can a man transform film and acting while never uttering a word? Can Jim Carrey, Steve Carrel, Will Ferrel or any comedian (Maybe Rowan Atkinson) for that matter have delivered such laughs while saying nothing. I think not. This masterpiece left me wanting more...does he really do that roller state scene with the missing railing? How did they film the scene with the tools flying everywhere? Remarkable at every turn.

Chaplin's genius is on full display throughout. An amazing crossroads moment as Chaplin maintains the silent film aesthetic with some concessions to the new ""talkies"" technology.
The story succeeds as a social satire, as a love story and as a comedy all in one. No mean feat. Chaplin's costar and ""wife"" Paulette Goddard is stunning and he frames every scene she is in with a close up that shows her face to be one that the camera loves. Chaplin sings a nonsensical song in French which is a classic scene and there are many others.

I imagined watching The Three Stooges without coversation, only their trademark sound effects. Still hilarious. The political tone was not popular nor was Chaplin & even less so as post war paranoia seized the country a few years later. Chaplin was ahead of his time, ironically, with a silent movie.

1879920,5,B000096IBI,"Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin, 1936)

I've spent the past few decades assiduously overlooking old film comedies, mostly because of my dislike for the contemporary comedy shorts (the Three Stooges, the Little Rascals, et al.). I decided earlier this year that I was going to stop doing that; after all, they can't all be that bad. One of the earliest stops on this new journey of mine was Modern Times, Charlie Chaplin's 1936 extravaganza that makes it into critics' 100-best lists with almost alarming regularity.

The basic idea is that Chaplin, a factory worker, and Paulette Goddard, a homeless waif, team up after Chaplin gets laid off when the factory closes (it's the Depression, remember) and try to make their way in the world. This leads both through a succession of jobs (and a rickety homestead), as well as more than one brush with the law.

I know there's a great deal of social commentary to be found here; I've read more than enough articles on the film to have missed that. But my mind is a sieve, and I can't remember terribly much about those articles. What I found important, and enjoyable, about the film is that it's a wonderfully-choreographed piece, a remnant of the silent era in the age of talkies (there is very little actual speech in the film), and an excellent showcase for Chaplin's talent for physical comedy. Add to this the eye-popping beauty of Paulette Goddard, a pitch-perfect sense of pace, and an array of sets that rivals most of what gets turned out seventy years later, and you have the recipe for a truly classic film. And Modern Times surely is that. **** ",1182729600,,1599,4.741007194244604

This movie is timeless, a masterpiece, a pleasure to watch and watch over and over again. It was the last silent movie Chaplin did and the last to feature the Little Tramp (beautiful ending with the two lovers walking arm and arm into a sunset.) The theme of the movie is how technology alienates the human being. Accidentally converted into a working class hero, Chaplin spends some time in jail, where he'd like to stay forever. There we watch one of the funniest scenes of the movie, the lunch with some ""white powder"". I couldn't stop laughing! In the times of the Great Depression, Chaplin portraits the unemployed and the hunger. Trying to find a steady job, he ends up in a Caffe where he waits on tables and sings. Yes! He does. The nonsense song (with Chaplin original voice in there) stands as one of the best moments in movie history. I can't quit this song off of my mind ... Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at the time, appears here in what's considered her best and liveliest leading lady.

The second DVD comes full loaded with many speacial features, like a documentary about ""Chaplin today"", deleted scenes, an introduction by Chaplin biographer David Robinson, a Karaoke of the nonsense song, the wonderful song Smile, sung by Liberace, a Behind the Scenes in the Machine Age 42 minutes documentary, and lots of more extras!

I recommend this DVD to everybody, you will not be disapointed, and I would say it's a MUST for movie collectors. A classic, a masterpiece, a timeless movie!

P.S. If you like my review vote YES. You can read all my other reviews if you wish to. I modestly write them to help people form an opinion about movies, music and books, but if nobody reads them (if you don't vote I do not know if you did) there is no point in writing them",1171756800,,2167,4.582474226804123
1879923,3,B000096IBI,"Charlie Chaplin was minimally a Communist fellow traveler.  A staunch supporter of the Soviet Union, he once told an interviewer with the ""Daily Worker"" that we should ""Thank God for Communism.""  At the very best, Chaplin could be described as a naive utopian.  ""Modern Times"" was a not so subtle attack against American capitalism.  Chaplin's Little Tramp is presented as a victim of a social system which victimizes the working class. The modern world is alienating human beings from their authentic selves.  A class war exists between the haves and the have-nots.  Employers exploit their workers and deserve to be sabotaged and ripped off. Factories allegedly turn the individual into a robotic creature to be pitied.  Chaplin focussed exclusively on the negative aspects of the ""Modern Times"" of the early twentieth Century---and never paid the slightest attention to its overwhelming benefits.  Aesthetically speaking, I also fail to appreciate Chaplin's slapstick brand of humor.  It seems too over the top.  Paulette Goddard, for instance, portrays Chaplin's impoverished romantic interest.  Still, her hair and lipstick always look perfect.  The unsophisticated audiences of over seventy years ago were much easier to please. Charlie Chaplin would be a nonentity in 2007.

1879924,5,B000096IBI,"""Modern Times"" begins with a shot of sheep going down a runway followed by a shot of workers entering a factory... Charlie is set down in the midst of industrial civilization, which is dominated by machinery and in which men are organized into mechanical units, Capital and Labor... Charlie's real enemies are no longer the Cop or the Boss, with whom he can always enter into some human relation, but a vast impersonality, invisible and invulnerable...

""Modern Times"" offered a variety of minor attractions: it featured Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard; it had wonderful gags; it indulged in tricks of sound which came to the very edge of being dialog... But what did the picture mean, what was it trying to say? Because Chaplin charged his usual enormous percentage for it, and because of foreign receipts, ""Modern Times"" made money, but exhibitors were not happy at the limited audience turnout... For the majority, the new Charlie was too serious; for the minority, not serious enough...

Since the picture seemed to be about the dehumanizing effect of machinery, intellectuals called upon Chaplin to join them in reorganizing machine culture to some more human scale of things...

Off the screen, Chaplin said nothing... On the screen, his anarchic hostility for any kind of machine culture expressed itself in scenes like that in which Charlie is fed by a machine and that in which, crazed by the assembly line, he runs into the street, his arms moving convulsively like two pistons... Charlie the rebel, Charlie the poet, Charlie the invincibly human, had been turned into a machine...",1168128000,,1592,5.0456273764258555

You know, these are hard times we live in.  The world appears to be caving in, crumpling under the weight of worries: war in the Middle East going on and on, uncomfortable changes in weather patters, corruption in politics.  The news can really get you down and in a funk.  The answer, the antidote: watch Charlie Chaplin.  I kid you not.  I've seen this film before and each time it just reaches into my heart and tickles me till I'm alive with laughter.  Chaplin was a truly gifted comic master with almost no peer except for the much beloved Keaton.  ""Modern Times"" is such a masterpiece and it came at a critical junction in film history.  When it was made in 1936, films had already added live speech (Jolson spoke a bit in 1927 in ""The Jazz Singer"" and talkies were in full swing by the early 30's.  Chaplin surely knew that the days of purely silent films was at an end.  He rose to the occasion by creating one of the most famous dramatic and comedic masterpieces in all of cinematic history.

While speaking per se is not what you notice in ""Modern Times"", the few speaking parts are funny and used with great effect.  What we do notice is Chaplin's unmistakable and incredible physical humor.  We see how he falls over, how he moves his feet, how he kicks things with deft accuracy with those oversize shoes.  We see him run and skid on the floor.  These are hilarious and typical Chaplin moves.  In one scene he just goes over the top in what must be one of the most sensational moments.  He puts on roller skates and suddenly starts skating around like he has been doing this all his life, showing remarkable ability.  Then he puts on a blind fold and shows off, all the while skating within mere inches of a sharp drop to the floor below.  The effect makes you gasp out loud each time he comes close to falling over.  This is Chaplin at his pinnacle.

There are many books written about this film and all one can do is to encourage others to take out, buy it, rent it....just watch and enjoy.  Here is a really great film, written, directed and scored by Charlie Chaplin.  A must own for the serious fan.",1166486400,,2156,4.4

My stomach hurt from laughing.  The 2nd part of this movie IS a little bit ""slower"" I have to admit.  I think the funniest stuff is the 1st half.  But overall, it's a FANTASTIC movie.

1879927,5,B000096IBI,"The more I watch it, the more I feel that Charlie Chaplin's sublime silent  MODERN TIMES (1936) is his finest film.  THE GOLD RUSH (1925) is too desolate for my tastes, and CITY LIGHTS (1931) does not have the exquisite Paulette Goddard (then Chaplin's wife) as leading lady.  MODERN TIMES is more episodic than other Chaplin features--six or seven one reel comedies strung together for 83 minutes.  There are two incomparable segments set in a dehumanizing factory (in this silent film, the boss speaks over surveillance photography)--Chaplin gets caught inside the gears of a machine, while much later his boss, Chester Conklin from the Keystone Kops, has the same thing happen during lunch hour.  It is hysterical to see Chaplin feed lunch to the upside down head of Conklin inside the machine.  It is also pricelessly funny when Charlie is guinea pig for a new mechanized lunch demonstration that fails miserably.

Meanwhile, out along the waterfront (location work was done at San Pedro harbor), an indomitable Paulette Goddard watches as her father is killed by a mob, feeds bananas to children, and is helped by Chaplin out of a robbery of food when she is starving.  The scenes with Goddard are heartbreakingly lovely, while Charlie is having a great time in prison--no work to do and free food!  ""Can't I please stay longer?"" he asks the warden on a title card as he is being paroled.  He will get his wish when he inadvertently becomes the leader of a labor rally waving a red Communist flag.

Eventually, Chaplin and Goddard set up housekeeping together in a waterfront shack.  She tags along when he gets a job as an all night watchman in a department store.  Paulette tries on a fur coat and goes to sleep on a bed up on the fourth or fifth floor.  Charlie will wake her before the store opens.  But first she watches aghast as he roller skates blindfolded, oblivious to a giant hole in the store four or five stories deep!  Then while Paulette sleeps, Charlie tries to be a good security guard on the first floor.  There is a story robbery, but one of the criminals recognizes an old pal from prison so they leave Charlie alone.  He gets drunk on a barrel of booze, then eventually falls asleep in the lingerie department under a pile of clothes.  Unemployment again in the morning.

Finally, Charlie tries his hand, with major coaching from Goddard, as a combination waiter and singer in a fancy restaurant.  This is the very first time the Little Tramp talks in movies, singing a gibberish song.  But Charlie quits the job when Paulette is arrested for vagrancy.  Eluding the police, the two of them head off into a sunrise and bright new future in one of the loveliest endings in all of modern movie history for me.  Chaplin's swansong to The Little Tramp forever.  Movie comedies just don't get much better than this Depression era gem.

I have MODERN TIMES as part of the two-disk Chaplin Collection authorized by the Chaplin Estate.  It looks and sounds like a million bucks, but curiously seems to have been trimmed by a few minutes from the 87 minute original. (All of the Chaplins seem slightly trimmed--for heaven's sake, why?) Disk two bonuses that will take you a good two hours to see--thus a full evening for everything--include a 30 minute chat with two Belgium filmmakers analyzing the movie as they watch it, deleted scenes, the nightclub gibberish song done as Karaoke to try and understand what on earth Chaplin is singing, the classic theme song ""Smile"" sung by Liberace, a Cuban village seeing their very first movie (MODERN TIMES) with great excitement, U.S. Labor shorts (which I could not get sound on), and a huge 250 stills production gallery.

MODERN TIMES is, quite simply, one of the great comedies of all time and, arguably, Chaplin's most sublime masterpiece.  It is sold individually, as a double bill with CITY LIGHTS, as part of one of two Chaplin archives boxed sets, and probably rentable from Netflicks.  With so many wonderful Harold Lloyd silent comedies now available in restored 35mm archive prints, along with the same for Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin is getting ignored again.

1879931,5,B000096IBI,"Chaplin's immortal comedy about industrial society is as funny and hard-hitting today as it was back then.  His Tramp's constant attempt to find comfort in any way possible (even institutionalizing himself) along with the plight of the orphan girl is yet another example of his perfect handle on comedic drama and how to make people laugh while feeling really depressed at the same time.

This movie was made in 1936, long after sound had taken over cinema, and beyond just being a satire of industry and ""modern times"", it's a farewell of sorts to the Tramp proper.  People wanted to know what the Tramp sounded like, and Chaplin knew that his character didn't work in sound, so even though this was made late, it's still silent... except for sound added in primarily to create a feeling of abuse.

A few things are turned around this time.  Instead of trying to get the girl, the girl gets along quite fine staying with him.  But what's most interesting, especially to Chaplin fans, is the finally where the Tramp ""sings.""  Finally the image of sound as oppression is discarded, the Tramp learns to be vocal, everyone loves him and thinks he's brilliant, yet still the world oppresses and he's forced to walk away with the promise that ""We'll manage.""

And we never see the Tramp again.

It is quite a powerful film (even while it splits your sides with laughter) and definitely one of his best.

1879932,1,B000096IBI,"Almost everyone who has reviewed this film gave it 5 stars, and the lowest it got from anyone was 4.  Well, too bad.

This is a dreadful film.

I laughed about 4 times during the whole thing.  A lot of predictable, obvious, unclever slapstick, and awful lot of it really contrived or just stupid (I longed for death during the interminable scene where he goes round and round the dance floor carrying the tray).

But the worst part of all was the ""social commentary"" aspect.  This film is pure luditism.  In a nutshell, Chaplin couldn't handle the fact that technology-- talkies-- was displacing him and his silent movie approach, and so he railed against all technology.  NINE YEARS after talkies came in, he's still stubbornly clinging to silents; apparently these ""talking pictures"" are just a fad.  It's the most pathetic of crusades.

Oh, and it's not hard to see why people thought Chaplin was a communist.  The character of the owner of the steel mill might as well have lept off the pages of Marx himself, he's such a grotesque caricature of a capitalist, sitting around doing jigsaw puzzles, reading comics, and yelling at the proletariat to work faster.

Happily, for the most part, the movie doesn't maintain this virulently anti-capitalistic tone.  But its attempt to capture the pathos of the depression is itself pathetic.  When the factory reopens, Chaplin exclaims ""Work at last!""-- but the reality is that he's already had THREE jobs during the movie, and he lost ALL of them through his own incompentence, not because of the depression.  The great moral stance that this movie takes is that it glorifies bunglers and thieves.

Let it not be said, though, that I found nothing good in the film.  Chaplin's stunt work (I assume that was actually him) in the blindfolded rollerskating scene is mindbogglingly good.  Truely remarkable.  I'd gladly trade the whole rest of the film for just that scene.",1125705600,,1915,4.8730650154798765

1879934,5,B000096IBI,"This was one of my introductions to Charlie Chaplin's brilliant body of work in film.  I must have been about twelve or thirteen.  While other kids were out watching Luke Perry and Tom Cruise, I had a growing love for early film.  ""Modern Times"" is a timeless, laugh-out-loud, very intelligent and insightful little picture about modern life, the plight of the assembly line worker and the ""pick them up by their bootstraps"" mentality that has been attributed to the growth--and sometimes downfall--of modern day American society.

We meet the ""Little Tramp"" (Charlie Chaplin) once again.  This time, he is working in an assembly line, working the nine-to-five with no possiblity of promotion.  Eventually, the little fellow snaps, and begins operating on various things with his tools (this includes a fireplug and a woman's garments).  The film follows his adventures and misadventures in the world.  It is the era of the Great Depression, and a new job is not easy to come by.  He encounters the Gamin (Paulette Goddard), a struggling young woman who comes from a poor background, and is striving to just put food on the table for her family.  When their paths cross, inevitably, neither of their lives remains the same.

Though, this film was made post ""talkie"" (i.e. sound was already incorporated into films several years before it was released).  Charlie Chaplin, director, star and writer, insisted that this body of work stick to the standard he had set for silent pictures.  Though, there is minimal dialogue toward the end (and one sentence uttered early on), Chaplin and his co-stars stick to the broad accessiblity of physical comedy and facial expressions, to convey to the audience what is going on in the plot.  This definitely works to its advantage.

A great example of Chaplin's genius...which reminds me...I still need to buy this!!!",1123113600,,1853,5.029508196721311

Godard is brilliant in the role as the woman living by her wits and she sure is very attractive and quite beautifull and one does not have to think twice why Chaplin picked her to star in this movie. Chaplin is an amazing actor and he plays the role with dedication, fortitude and he must be ranked as one of the best actors of the begining of the 20th century. The scene with the rollarskates and him singing in gibberish are classic scenes and show his brilliance in the last silent movie made in Hollywood.

Charlie is a victim of the assembly line, turning bolts at a maddening pace until he goes crazy. He goes to jail after getting caught up in a communist demonstration (unwittingly), and doesn't want to go free - he's happy in jail and taken care of: it's better to be there than in the world of no work or where he's brutally victimized. He befriends an innocent ""gamin"" (Paulette Goddard) living by her wits, and the scenes with her are lovely (minus the pathos). There is an absolutely astounding scene in a department store where Chaplin is rollerskating blindfolded near the edge of a balcony, and another (very famous) where he sings in gibberish in a cafe. The only talking in the movie comes via mechanical devices - a movie screen, a radio, a phonograph. For once at the end he gets the girl. A marvelous movie.

1879937,5,B000096IBI,"Charlie Chaplin's outstanding 1936 flick ""Modern Times"" clearly demonstrates that he was one of the most significant creators of physical comedy.  Not only did he write, produce and direct the movie, he composed the musical score!

""Modern Times"" is a testimony to Chaplin's comedic genius.  In the final screen appearance of his celebrated character The Little Tramp, he appears as a factory worker in a huge and modern industrial complex.  The pressures and rigorous nature of his mindless and repetitive job lead him to a nervous breakdown.  He hilariously goes running wild through the factory until he is captured and sent off to convalesce.

Upon his release, he is confronted with a society high in unemployment, homelessness and hunger and has difficulty finding a job.  He meets ""the gaiman"", a tattered homeless yet cheerful waif played by Paulette Goddard.  Together they embark on a hysterical adventure as the trudge through life trying to make ends meet.

In this satire of modern mechanized society, Chaplin's comic wit shines brightly.  With the nimbleness of a ballet dancer he performs his role of The Little Tramp as nobody else can.  Constantly and accidently running afoul of the law, he spends the film getting in and out of jail.

""Modern Times"" is an absolute laugh riot amid Chaplin's commentary on society.  The scenes in the dilapidated house and as a watchman in a department store were some of the funniest I've ever experienced.

  I didn't fully appreciate Charlie Chaplin until I became a mature adult and had learned what respectible work he had done.  I once got into City Limits (1931).  Chaplin was a short funny man.  It wasn't until I saw him as an older gentleman in a clip on the Academy Awards program that aired April 10, 1972, when he was being honored that I realized him.  It was his first trip back in America in years and he said to the audience, ""you dear people"", with tears in his eyes.  He was so humble.

  Turner Classic Movies recently ran a 24-hour marathon of Chaplin films in August 2004.  He did do films that were speaking roles.  He was so brilliant in A King In New York (1957).  Modern Times (1936) is Chaplin at his best.  The first 18 minutes with Chaplin as a factory worker is hilarious.  I was shocked to see the muscled-man factory worker ""Section Five"" with his shirt always off here in this 1936 film.

  Chaplin is a factory worker and possibly the best, but he gets no respect.  Not even enough time to use the bathroom.  The boss even tries a new invention on getting the employees to eat faster.  Chaplin goes insane, or rather, has a nervous breakdown, and is sent to jail for disturbing and damaging the factory.  Now out of jail and the factory closed down, Chaplin just walks the street.  he finds a dropped flag from a truck and he picks it up.  Suddenly, a stampede of angry Union Workers come from behind him.  He innocently gets mixed in with the crowd and the police see the flag he is holding and he is sent to jail again.  That is just the beginning of the story.

  There are hundreds of funny bits in thi film, but what is disturbing to me is when the little guy mistakenly is sent to jail all over again.  But when he gets out, he does find love in a woman (Paulette Goodard, who later became Chaplin's real wife).

  Gloria DeHaven is one of the young orphans.  She was the daughter of Chaplin's assistant director.

1879940,5,B000096IBI,"Five stars isn't enough for this film which is a deserved classic, one of the great movies ever made. If you've never seen a Chaplin film, ""Modern Times"" is the one to sample first: it's more accessible than Charlie's silent movies and the plot, theme, acting, music and ambiance of the movie is superb in every way. It would be hard not to adore this movie, it has everything in it.

What can you say about Chaplin that hasn't already been said? He was a genius of the highest realm. He wrote, directed, composed the music and starred in ""Modern Times"" and his inimitable charisma surrounds the entire production. I've seen this movie 30 times and never get weary of it, there's always something new to notice or appreciate. The way Charlie moves his body is always a joy to behold. My favorite scene is towards the end of the film when the Tramp finally speaks on film, albeit in gibberish, in his famous ""Nonsese Song."" Note that there is no doubt Michael Jackson completely ripped off Charlie with his ""moonwalk"" dance, which he lefts almost entirely from Charlie's dance preceding the ""Nonsense Song."" Indeed, Chaplin's gifts as a compsoser are in full force here, the music is beautiful throughout.

""Modern Times"" has it all: laughter, tears, pathos, as well as a social message 50 years ahead of its time. Modern industry dulls the human spirit and imprisons the soul, making workers lose their individuality and humanity. Charlie points this out in comedic ways, as well as more serious undertones.

Paulette Goddard, Charlie's third wife (we think, their marriage certificate has never surfaced), is excellent in the supporting role of the homeless gamin. Her beauty is exceptional. Even with minimal make-up anda  simple hairdo, she is stunningly gorgeous. Charlie always had good taste in judging women's beauty and Paulette is no exception!

""Modern Times"" is a timeless cinematic masterpiece. Cherish your initial viewing, you'll never forget its impact as you laugh, cry and reflect on the genius of Charles Chaplin. My highest recommendation.",1094342400,,2058,4.988338192419825
1879941,5,B000096IBI,"The 1930s saw Charlie Chaplin appear in only two motions pictures, both of them silent, and both of them brilliant:  CITY LIGHTS and MODERN TIMES.  The latter is many things:  the last major silent film to come out of Hollywood, the final film to feature the Little Tramp, and the first film to feature Chaplin's voice, albeit only in song.  It is also Chaplin's last truly great film, though THE GREAT DICTATOR and even MONSEIUR VERDOUX had some marvelous moments.  Although sound film had emerged from its infancy to reach full maturity by 1936, the things that Chaplin is able to do almost makes one regret the demise of the silent film.

Chaplin is so spry and active in this film that one can scarcely credit that he is 47 years old.  In scene after scene he demonstrates his utter mastery of his own body, skating as brilliantly as he has in any of a number of shorts in the first years of his stardom, or as graceful as any ballet dancer skipping along an assembly line, squirting his coworkers with oil out of a can.  Apart from perhaps Fred Astaire, was there ever a more graceful performer than Chaplin?  His fellow silent star Buster Keaton was perhaps more purely athletic, but his was the physical prowess of the stunt man, while Chaplin's was that of the imp.

Unlike Keaton, who too often tended to have actresses far beneath his skills, Chaplin loved to have strong actresses with him.  This one, Paulette Goddard he married (though she was later unable to present a wedding certificate).  Fascinatingly, given Chaplin's legendary attraction to very young girls, teenagers even, Goddard's character, according to the credits ""A Gamin,"" was a minor.  That, and a host of somewhat risqu&eacute; jokes early in the film, make one surprised that it managed to pass muster with the Hays office.

The official Amazon reviewer states that this is Chaplin's satire of the mechanical world, but that it not quite correct.  It is true that in his films as a whole Chaplin never is at ease with machines the way that Keaton was in his (Keaton's two greatest films, THE GENERAL and THE NAVIGATOR, feature a steam train and a steam ship more or less as costars), this film is not focused as a whole on machines.  The target is, instead, the world of capitalism, specifically, the plight of the proletarian.  The Little Tramp is inept as a wage earner in a time that demands that one either be a wage owner or a wage payer, or else be unemployed and therefore unfed.  Many of his struggles in the film have nothing to do with machinery or mechanization.  Only near the end, when he briefly appears to have a gift for art, is he able to achieve anything even remotely approaching competence in his job.  The anti-capitalist themes are so blatant in the film (indeed, in the first frames, which show first a herd of sheep and then a group of workers entering a factory) that the film indirectly led to Chaplin's exile from the United States in 1952, when he left the country partly because of accusations of tax evasion and partly because of accusations of having been a Communist.  He was not the latter, but he was unquestionably something of a naive politics (by that I mean that Chaplin's political ideas were not deeply articulated, though their tendency was unmistakable).

I can't emphasize enough how superbly the picture looks in this film.  The picture is sharp and crisp, with absolutely no hint of a worn print.  The way we see it here is as good as it has ever looked.  The musical score, which was composed by Chaplin, is marvelous, culminating in his most famous composition the exquisite ""Smile.""

Although Chaplin contemplated a different ending, the one we have is as perfect as can be imagined.  Chaplin and Goddard, escaped from the officers who want to return her to a juvenile home, prepare to go down the road together.  She looks downcast, but he cheers her and looking at her very clearly says to her, ""Smile.""  The camera cuts to behind them, and we see them together walking down the road.  It is an absolutely perfect image for the last seconds the Little Tramp will ever appear onscreen.",1093910400,,4116,4.668515950069348
1879942,5,B000096IBI,"MODERN TIMES opens with its credits being printed out over a close-up image of a clock ticking interminably forward. The film's first real shot is of mindless sheep being herded through gates, which fades into an image of factory employees exiting a subway stop on their way to work. Looking at this from a modern standpoint, one can only think that the more things change, the more they stay the same.

 This is a film that I can watch over and over again. It's not just that it's an incredibly funny film. It's not just that its satire of modernization and industrialization still rings true today. It's that each aspect of the filmmaking pulls together to form something greater than each individual part. The story ranges from big topics concerning the Great Depression and dehumanization, while successfully balancing that with the small love story between the tramp and the gamin. In a theme that would be revisited even more powerfully in LIMELIGHT, the two characters need each other, depend on each other and simply have no reason to exist without the other. The comedy tickles while the tragedy touches. No other director in film history managed to find that equilibrium with such skill.

 This is rightly hailed as the last great silent movie, albeit one made several years after sound has become the norm. I still get a kick out of the fact that the only intelligible voices come solely from machines. Chaplin is making a silent film using sound technology, meaning he has the option to take the best of the both worlds. His next film, THE GREAT DICTATOR, wouldn't quite get this mixture right, but it's a success here. The film can go for several minutes at a time with no meaningful talking or sound effects, and then suddenly jump into an unexpected gag involving voice. The mixture of sound and silent set pieces was inevitable at this point in film history, but I've never seen it pulled off as well as Chaplin does it here.

 While disc one contains the film itself in beautifully restored condition, the second DVD is full of extras. Most important is the ""Chaplin Today -- Modern Times"" documentary. This is more or less structured around two French directors (Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne) discussing the film. Absolutely fascinating stuff. They analyze the film's jokes, its metaphors and its themes. They talk about everything from the number of frames per second shot to the number of gags that revolve around food. Also included in the documentary is some footage of Chaplin meeting Gandhi. I have nothing to add; I just had to mention it.

 Chaplin's nonsense song, the tune he sings at the end of the film in faux Italian, is the subject of two extras. The first is an extended version, featuring a final verse that never made it to the final edit. The second is a Karaoke version of the song (I'm not making this up). And speaking of Chaplin's music, there's an excerpt from 1950s TV of Liberace himself (of all people) performing ""Smile"" -- the theme from MODERN TIMES. Great rendition of a great song.

 There's also a short (ten minute) documentary from 1967 called ""Por primera vez"" (""For The First Time"") in which peasants in a tiny village in Cuba are shown a movie for the first time. It's a fascinating look at what film means to people who have never actually watched one before. The reason for its inclusion on this DVD is that the film in question is, of course, MODERN TIMES. It may be an odd choice for their first film experience given that the story of a factory worker undergoing a nervous breakdown may not be something that relates well to people who rarely even see automobiles. But the villagers laugh at the right places and seem genuinely enthused. The documentary is well worth watching and will fascinate anyone with an interest in the societal ramifications of film.

 The picture restoration on the main feature is also fabulous. The image has never looked crisper. While this is nominally a silent movie, the original release did feature a synchronized soundtrack of sound effects and Chaplin's musical score (which means, unlike other ""silent"" DVD releases, we connoisseurs don't have to argue about whether this particular sound track is wonderful and totally keeping in the spirit of what would have been played at the time, or a complete outrage that should result in everyone responsible being shot). The sound quality is excellent, bringing one of my favorite film soundtracks to life superbly.

 If I was going to recommend one Chaplin movie to someone, I think I'd have to choose this one. It has two major things going for it. It's a great film, but it's also extremely representative of his body of work. It has comedy, it has pathos, it features the tramp, it has a message. And it's also one of the most influential movies that Chaplin ever made. Everyone, from film to television (remember Lucille Ball working at the candy factory?), has either made reference to MODERN TIMES, or just plain stolen some of its gags. The image of Charlie being dragged into the heart of the gears and cogs of a giant unfathomable machine is familiar to even those people who haven't seen the movie. If you like this film, then you should already own this release. And if you haven't seen it before, then this is absolutely worth a gander. You'll be surprised at just how modern and fresh this classic movie is.",1091145600,,5361,4.756727664155005
1879943,5,B000096IBI,"Modern times was a smart comedy in the previous years to WW2.
Charlot made raptures images in several sequences.
Our unlucky or disadapted little man , definitively wasn{t made for working with the industrial process. This kinetic introduction in the middle of the complex mecahnism of machine systems is a issue to develop unforgettable laughable situations. The sense of alienation in front the no ending belt , causes in him an insane loss of the reality. And the machine who feeds you without waste of time for your employers is a classic.
Obviously Charlot inspired himself in Metropolis, the bitter nightmare of Fritz Lang from 1927. (Watch for instance for the employer who works around the machine control) .
So our beloved anti hero goes out from this the factory to the hospital and over and over he tries to get a job but he fails , by one reason or another.
In the middle of the film will appear a deep inspiration. The eternally beauty Paulette Godard represents exactly that weird mix teenager-woman who will work out as link for him later.
He is a guy with good feelings. He acts always as humanity benefactor but the long arm of the fate runs behind him and the results are not succesful.
The sequences in the dinner hall with the chicken that never comes to the impatient client is a masterpiece. Literally it's a funny coreography dance in the purest sense of the word.
Smile ; no matter what's wrong with you. We'll keep ahead , overcoming all the possible obstacles.
A remarkable film and one of the landmark pictures of this timeless genius.
Haven't you seen it? Make yourself a favour and buy it as a gift for you or your wife or fiancee or kids. This film will never dissapoint you , at least in the next three hundred years.",1086652800,,1748,4.605769230769231
1879944,5,B000096IBI,"Until I saw ""Modern Times"" I only knew Chaplin from clips and impressions rather than from his films.  I didn't see the talent.  I understood that he parlayed his popularity into power and control over his work and that he made a huge contribution to American cinema.  But I found Chaplin the performer, cloying and sentimental.
After watching ""Modern Times"" however, I understand why he is one of the great performing talents of the 20th century.  The film is nearly silent and mostly a series of comedic set-pieces, each one a virtuoso display of Chaplin's boundless talent.
What struck me most in watching Chaplin was both his ability to come up with a routine; strapped to an eating machine, skating blindfolded in a department store and amusing hardened diners as a dancing waiter and executing the concept with grace, humanity and humor.  It is also a great testament to his acting that we never question Chaplin's ""little tramp"" an average, slightly ludicrous character who has amazing talent that deeply undercuts his character's supposed mediocrity.
My other surprise was how effective and nuanced the satire is in ""Modern Times.""  Chaplin's little tramp is the perfect protagonist in a story about the perils of automation and technology.  The little tramp is never defeated and always optimistic.  He is like a cartoon character in that each travail is new and he doesn't carry with him the baggage from the previous experience.  But he is also terribly human; frail, self absorbed, eccentric and resilient so that we the audience don't feel the oppressive weight that automation and technology has upon the working person.  Without a strong, human protagonist, the attack against modern society could seem more global and distancing.  Instead we witness the pain from an individual perspective that connects to our own lives.",1078963200,,1837,5.09
1879945,5,B000096IBI,"Modern Times is the last silent film that Charles Chaplin created in a time when talking was common on the silver screen.  Once more Chaplin takes roll as the Tramp where he is exploited as cheap labor that can be used whenever needed, since the Tramp's options are rather limited due to his monetary needs.  However, even an honest hard worker such as the Tramp can suffer from burn-out and go astray as he is sent to a mental institution.  Cured and recovered he departs from the institution, but ends up in the wrong place at the wring time and is sent to jail.  Modern Times displays the socio-economic needs and vulnerability of the poor who fall outside the system.  At the same time, the film displays gentle love and care that provides a base for hope and dreams for those who are struggling for a happier and better life.  Overall, Modern Times presents an excellent cinematic opportunity that gives both laughs and tears, which will leave some pondering the structure of the society.",1073692800,,993,4.67816091954023
1879946,5,B000096IBI,"Next to ""The Gold Rush,"" ""Modern Times"" is probably Chaplin's best film. There are many, many memorable moments (among others, the famous scenes in which Chaplin goes through the gears of a machine) along with social commentary, something that is present in most of Chaplin's feature films.
There is no better way to see ""Modern Times"" than on this two-disc DVD. The film is on the first disc. The picture is crystal clear and razor sharp, and Chaplin's interesting and memorable musical score sounds great.
The many extra features are located on the second disc. David Robinson, one of Chaplin's biographers, gives a good introduction. For the more serious Chaplin fans, there is a ""Chaplin Today"" documentary that goes in-depth about the production of the film, and also contains some analysis from filmmakers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne (they did ""Rosetta,"" which won the Golden Palm at Cannes). Unfortunately, the Dardennes' analysis is not particularly strong, and is obvious to even the least educated viewer.
Next, there is Chaplin's nonsense song uncut, along with a karaoke version of the song. There is a deleted scene which is fairly amusing, but rightly deleted. There are a bunch of archival films, including ""Behind-the-Scenes of the Machine Age"" (a government film), ""Smile"" sung by Liberace (!), and, best of all, a Cuban film called ""For the First Time.""
Extras are rounded out with an enormous photo gallery, a few trailers, a poster gallery, and some scenes from other Chaplin films.",1072828800,,1503,5.1138211382113825
1879947,5,B000096IBI,"It helps that Modern Times is one of Chaplin's best films, period, running a close second behind City Lights (I hope that's next on the re-release list).  And happily, unlike The Gold Rush, which was ruined by awful sound choices, the Modern Times DVD offers a clean transfer of the film with all the beloved original elements intact as far as I could see and hear, plus a host of extras.
The film itself is the most briskly paced of Chaplin's feature-length films.  And his writing is sharp, unhindered by the sermonizing which permeates his last works.  The dilemma facing our Little Tramp this time is something all of us can relate to:  For the first time, we see him thinking ahead, wanting to have a future, to form a family, and working towards that end.  Chaplin's physical-comedy skills are at their peak:  Witness the extended takes of the rollerskate scene, and the factory assembly line.  Even if the 18fps (sometimes 16fps) film speed made everything look faster than it really was, it's still impressive physical co-ordination requiring flawless execution, since Chaplin rarely edits using coverage.
In Modern Times we see one of the first truly well-rounded Chaplin heroines.  The radiant Paulette Goddard was Chaplin's best leading lady, her high spirits and lively presence being a much better foil for Chaplin than the starry-eyed icons of perfection that were Georgia Hale, Edna Purviance, or Virginia Cherrill.  She just has more star quality and brings a quirkier, more animated personality to Chaplin's films, balancing them nicely.
And the gags -- some of the best in the Chaplin canon.  The eating machine always has me rolling on the floor; the nonsense song is terrific (the DVD offers a ""karaoke"" version which, though a novelty, does tell us finally what the lyrics actually are); and all the machine gags are fast-moving gems.
The bonus materials include a long outtake and several documentaries.  ""Chaplin Today"" features guests Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, the French filmmakers behind the film Rosetta, and though their film-historian banter is not entirely to my taste, they do bring up some insights that I hadn't observed about Modern Times.
In all, a great release, and a great DVD to have for movie nights.  It's a wonderful presentation of a comedy classic.",1059436800,,2296,5.0131578947368425
1879948,5,B000096IBI,"I love old movies and own several Criterion Collection DVDs from the 1930s, but in terms of picture quality, none compare with the new Chaplin Collection restoration of ""Modern Times"" (1936).  The restoration looks pristine, with no graininess whatsoever and only the very occasional artifact.  They even have a remastered Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  My only complaints about the first disc: no audio commentary to accompany the film, and more than five minutes of warnings from FBI, Interpol, etc. in every language.  I didn't sit all the way through, but my ""Forward"", ""Next"" and ""Menu"" buttons were disabled.  I had to hit ""Stop"" then ""Play"" again to get back to the main menu.
The second disc has an introduction by biographer David Robinson documentary, in which Robinson explains that Chaplin was very concerned with and educated about economics and the role of industry in causing the Great Depression.  His ideas became the driving force behind ""Modern Times"".
The documentary features a commentary by two French directors.  I didn't find it particularly insightful.  However, there is also footage of Chaplin (without his Tramp costume) with Gandhi and talking to a camera.  Though brief, it gave me my first look at Chaplin the man (I had only seen him as the Tramp).
Overall, an excellent work, and highly recommended.  Oh yeah, the film's good too.",1059091200,,1355,5.063063063063063
1879949,5,B000096IBI,"Modern Times (1936) is quite possibly the defining picture of Charlie Chaplin's career.  I've been renting Chaplin movies lately and Modern Times is by far the best one that I've seen.  The Little Tramp (Chaplin) is a factory worker who has been working on the assembly line a bit too long.  Even not on the line, he finds his hands making the movements that he did when working.  He goes a little kooky and finds himself taking the blame for stealing bread to protect a young woman (Paulette Goddard).  The Tramp also inexplicably steals from a couple of merchants and requests that the police officer nearby pay for it.  This lands him in jail. He gets out, but lands himself right back in jail when he appears to lead a communist workers revolt.
The film focuses on the Tramps relationship with the woman as well as his attempts to work in the factory (several different jobs).  The funniest stuff is in the factory as Chaplin lets loose with his trademark physical humor.  I think this is Chaplin's best and most well-crafted films and if he is only remembered for one film, it should be this one.",1058313600,,1101,4.581632653061225

I guess it's true when they say no one could ever do what he did. The skating scene is great and the plot's good as well. The hearding dissolve at the beginning is a great touch. The only down side is that many people today might not conect as well to the humor, but the character is definately something to remember, and it's worth watching. If you're interested at all in him and his work, I suggest watching the biography movie they made about him. It must be sme form of genius, what he did. I know he probably put so much of himself into it, because as slapstick as it may be, there is honesty in what he did and the messages he tried to get across using a good medium-humor.",1032220800,,836,4.042168674698795

1879953,4,B000096IBI,"I have to confess, I had never seen a Charlie Chaplin film before I took a chance and purchased Modern Times on DVD. Why this film, you ask? I remembered it from a biography I saw of Chaplin on television. I was instantly impressed once I inserted it into my DVD player. The more I watch this cute little movie, the funnier it becomes.
The DVD is 1.33:1 (standard) and is in black and white. The picture is good enough for a 30's film. Oddly, the picture is ""cropped"" within a black square as if the screen were zoomed-out slightly. Chaplin wrote the score, being that this film is predominately ""silent"" (the characters raarely talk, although some do at times). There are title cards used intermittantly throughout as well. The music is very good, and confirms my opinion of Chaplin as a very multifaceted man of many talents.
It was a risky purchase that proved to be a wise-buy. You can be sure I will buy more Chaplin films in the future! Shame on the television networks and cable for not making me (and probably many others like me) more aware of this 20th Century icon.",1020297600,,1076,4.494897959183674

1879955,5,B000096IBI,"While it is only the first Charlie Chaplin movie I have seen, I am already prepared to say that this is one of his best works. In this memorable, hilarious and touching movie, Chaplin takes on the modern era along with his newfound girl friend (Paulette Goddard) in a quest for happiness.
Chaplin is a factory worker at a rather boring factory controlled by a boss who talks to his employees through screens (If that's not television, then I don't know what it is). With the same lame, repetitive work each day, Chaplin suffers a breakdown and is sent to the hospital. He recovers and is released, only to be arrested for accidentally being the leader of a communist parade. Goddard is a homeless girl who struggles everyday to live. Chaplin and Goddard eventually meet and the two vow to get a new home, ""Even if I have to work for it!""
There are countless memorable sight gags in Modern Times. My favorite is when Chaplin, employed as a mechanic's assistant, gets his boss stuck in a machine. Another equally memorable gag is when Chaplin, in prison, gets hyperactive after sprinkling `Nose Powder' on his food and inadvertently adverts a prison break.
There is much symbolism in this movie. For most of the film, the only things that have sound are mechanical objects such as machines, cars and radios. But for most of the film (As he was through the beginning of the silent era) Chaplin refuses to talk. His memorable song at the end, however, seems to show that he had given up and was ready to enter the modern times of cinema. If only all ""Comedians"" these days could be as funny or creative. I guess that's the ""Modern Times"" for you.",1007164800,,1642,4.58843537414966

1879957,5,B000096IBI,"Chaplin's Modern Times leaves us awed with various noteworthy marks. First of all, Chaplin endeavored to make his second sound film following City Lights (1931), in spite of the wide-conquering trend of talkie. Not only the background music but also occasional sound effects bring out the brilliance of the director. Second, even after two decades since his silver screen debut in 1914, the performance of Charlie the Little Tramp and Chaplin's directing had been matured, not faded, like a good wine. Those laughing spots fairly spread in the entire film proves it. Last but not least, you can never forget this film for the moment when the long-time silent Little Tramp finally open his mouth to sing!--for the first and final time, unless you count The Great Dictator (1940), the following film and another masterpiece of Chaplin. --After all those struggles, Charlie gets a job at a cafe, where his adventure partner the Gamine (Paulette Goddard; Chaplin's wife at that time) works as a dancer. Charlie is to wait and sing. As he can't remember the lyrics when rehearsing, the Gamine helps him writing the lyrics on his cuff for a cheat sheet. A fanfare goes and the Little Tramp marches in the floor stage performing an eccentric dance until he dances so hard that the cuffs are blown away. He frantically and desperately searches for the cuffs and the Gamine says (in the spoken title) ""Sing! Never mind the words!""-- It is well known that Chaplin was the last resistant against talkie claiming the universality of silent films. What he performed in this ""Titina"" sequence, singing in the stateless language (still obvious it is conjured up with a few languages such as French or Italian) and storytelling by his brilliant pantomime. The audience in the film reacts the same way as we do: get a nice-surprise, laugh and applaud. With its theme song ""Smile"", composed by Chaplin, the performance of Charlie the Little Tramp is definitely one of the highlights of this film.

In fact, the film's episodic structure is a delightful throwback to his early two-reelers. The inspired chemistry between Chaplin's Little Tramp and Paulette Goddard's Gamine forms the heart and soul of this cinema classic  beautifully evoked in the memorable closing shot.

1879959,5,B000096IBI,"The genius of Charlie is very evident in this wonderful movie.  Charlie's Little Tramp is one of the most well drawn characters to ever come out of Hollywood.  Charlie communicates well, how life really is, by pulling laughter out of bad luck and tragedy.  The sadness of the Great Depression, bread lines, lost jobs, shootings, and starving children is fodder for the Great One here as he first shows the sadness and then in the next scene makes one laugh out loud.
This is however far from a drama.  It is first and foremost a comedy of amazing proportions.  Charlie stretches his ability to the limit here.  His jerky walk (the result of too many hours on the job), the scene in jail with the small dog, and the preacher's wife (hope I whetted your curiosity with that scene description) and Charlie ""leading the parade"" (honestly, that looks like something that would happen to me) are all hysterical.  The funniest scene in the whole movie is the scene with the automatic lunch feeder.  I was rolling on my back, laughing during this routine.

Charlie Chaplin created the infamous ""Little Tramp (Derby hat, goose mustache, bamboo cane & very large shoes with the shuffling duck waddle)"" character who starred in all but two of his movies.
Chaplin owned his own movie studio by the age of 22.  He produced, wrote the scripts, directed, starred and did his own stunts in his movies.
With ""Modern Times"" add writing the music to his talents.  The eternal song ""Smile"" epitomized the theme of this machine age satire.
In summary this silent (digitally restored picture, sound effects & musical soundtrack) classic ""Modern Times"" is a great picture to watch. Chaplin pokes fun at the industrial age of machine & automation.  He believed the true motion picture was to be a visual experience not a talkie.  This was his message to the audience.  To challenge our ability to see the humor and drama unfold through his eyes.
One classic scene where Charlie is swimming through the large gears & machine sprockets like taffy shows us the great imagination & genius of Charles Chaplin.

They have no idea what the future will bring for them.  They have no money,and no jobs. But what they do have is their love for  each other.

His scene with Sammy  Stein the Turbin operator almost had me rolling out of my LazBoy.  Paulette  Goddard represented how hard times were in the Great Depression and helped  Chaplan as he made a social commentary on the times.  The industrial  revolution was also represented in a comical way.
The scene in jail  with the smuggled nose powder by another inmate that was stashed in the  salt unknown to the Little Tramp, and his reaction after salting and eating  his food, was hilarious. I don't condone drugs, but the way Chaplan finds  humor in things that happen to us out of the blue is great.
