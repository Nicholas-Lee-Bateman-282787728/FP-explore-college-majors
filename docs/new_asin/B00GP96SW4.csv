8626043,5,B00GP96SW4,Excellent Australian TV series known as Alien Surf Girls in the USA but Lightning Point elsewhere. These Region 4 discs play fine on my multi region player. Image and sound are clear. Wish there had been a season 2 to answer a lot of unresolved questions. But the series was cancelled.,1509148800,,285,4.607843137254902

8626045,5,B00GP96SW4,"This is a surprisingly good show! After the first three episodes I was kind of wavering, trying to decide whether I wanted to stick with it. But something kept me hooked and I am glad it did. I would have regretted not being able to see this entire season. I thought it was just going to be another one of those teen series that only teens could enjoy or a romantic chick flick. But to my pleasant surprise it was so much more. One of the best science fiction series I have seen in  a long time! And the actors and actresses pull it off very convincingly!  Do not know why it did not have holding power to last more seasons. It finished very strong and after the first five episodes I was glued. The writing really became top notch after the first five episodes. Great story! Now this is the way you do a science fiction story with credibility! On Netflex it has also achieved very high ratings. I am sure it is also available on Amazon prime. My only disappointment is there is no region free or region 1 version available for purchase.",1426982400,5,1037,4.312820512820513
