8335264,2,B001Q9GRRY,"I bought this DVD because I like Bollywood movie dance numbers. I was very disappointed at this DVD because every song has large white letters on the top of the widescreen video box that state ""dial xxx to download this ringtone"" and then after that a message telling you what to dial to download the song. It's filmed in widescreen, but the large white letters that appear for many seconds, several times during the course of each song are very distracting and really take away from the enjoyment of this disc and the music. It's also done in an MTV-like format, where at the beginning of each song a block comes up telling you what song it is. I find that a bit distracting too. I bought a couple other Bollywood dance number DVDs and they didn't have the same problem. I can enjoy them 100%. Unfortunately the same is not true of this disc. I would give the music itself 4 stars, but the sales-push ruins it for me.",1276646400,3,918,4.405882352941177
