8717553,4,B00Y63YJKY,"Charley Mortdecai (Johnny Depp) is a dubious art dealer and owes a lot of money. When a valuable painting goes missing and involves a murder, Charley is requested to help recover it. Charley doesn't have sex with his wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) as she is repulsed by his mustache and has a gag reflex every time they kiss. Meanwhile Alistair (Ewan McGregor) who has requested Charley is in love with Johanna and has no mustache.

The plot is a bit boring, however it is the individual scenes and dialogue that make the film enjoyable. Charley is inept and has a man servant do all his dirty work with consequences.
