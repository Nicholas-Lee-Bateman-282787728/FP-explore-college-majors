8025468,1,B0002B55E8,"This movie is complete dreck. Don't bother. Bad acting, flimsy storyline, weak dialogue and just boring. I guess if you are not a skateboard person you will not get it?",1399939200,,168,4.633333333333334
8025469,3,B0002B55E8,"This movie is contrived and ridiculous, but it's amusing watching Erik Mckay act as if he had written the lines himself.  I do like to see movies centered around skateboarders, but Larry Clark does a better job because he makes it honest.",1191542400,,238,4.666666666666667
8025470,3,B0002B55E8,"This was a movie I found for one dollar, and it was worth about that. Honestly I did kind of like it. It is however less a movie about skateing, as it is about this group of kids, that skate. It was typical suburbia, teens wishing they could get away, and doing what they can with what they have. What I related to most was the fling the main kid had with his teacher. I was in a situation like that before, and found it to be pretty much the exact experience I had. The music was good, dialogue decent. Overall I'd say if you've ever been in high school, and been a part of the skate scene, you should dig Levelland.",1146960000,2,617,4.065573770491803
8025471,4,B0002B55E8,"I recently rented this movie, and like it a lot. I thought the story was cool, and some of the actors were really good. I really liked ""Nick"", and ""Betty"". those were my favorite characters, and their acting was really believable. Also, the soundtrack rocked. Whoever did it had great taste. Editing was a little off. I wish the story went more into the older brother and his friends instead of the WB looking guy.  rock on",1098316800,5,423,4.4935064935064934
8025472,5,B0002B55E8,"Plenty of films have been made to exploit skateboarding's popularity; each time the sport hits a surge, Hollywood rushes to cash in.  This one's DIFFERENT.  It's an indy film that knows where it is coming from, has real roots. Director Walker clearly knows skaters, and teenagers in general as the film hits no false notes in depicting the joys and sorrows of being a skater and a kid just trying to grow up without going insane in a dead end, strip mall world most kids are born into these days.  The acting is quite good and the story holds up too - coming-of-age stuff that would be critically praised in any other country but the US, where teens are supposed to save the world daily by leaping from exploding fireballs and singing disco-pop songs instead of getting clinically bummed out by high school and taking their frustrations out on concrete and brain cells.  For me, it was the skating that shows the attention to detail - for once a film that ain't about pros, or wanting to be a pro, or acting like a pro etc etc.  The actors are all obviously real skaters chosen for their ability to be natural on camera.  Look for a cameo by the writer/ director in the (well shot!) swimming pool sequence - he's the barefoot one on a longboard.

The bonus is, the soundtrack ROCKS.  Tons of great old punk rock by groups like The Minutemen, Black Flag and the Meat Puppets, Replacements... too many to list.  Is there an album?  I'd buy it.",1091577600,9,1441,4.486590038314176
