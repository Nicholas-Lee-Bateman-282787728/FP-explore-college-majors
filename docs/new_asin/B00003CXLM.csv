1282685,5,B00003CXLM,Pokemon the Movie 2000 is a big improvement from the first film.  The animation is a lot better than the first movie.  The story is also fast paced and exciting.  The battles between the legendary birds can only be described as awesome!  There is never one boring moment in this film!  It also ties in a little emotion along with hints to strong feelings between Ash and Misty. This movie is for every age group.  It leaves the viewer craving more....  Can we say a third Pokemon movie?,970012800,,486,4.454545454545454
1282686,5,B00003CXLM,"First of all, let me begin by saying that I am 30 years old, and I think that Pokemon is one of the best things to come along in a very long time.
I had seen Pokemon the Movie 2000, (or Revelation Lugia as it is called in Japan) and I will say, all in all that I was very impressed with the story and the music in this film.  The animation is not first rate by any means, but it really isn't all that bad either.  Believe me, I have seen much worse.
I feel that the common misconception about Pokemon is that Pokemon deals with an on-going story, kind of like a ""soap-opera"" in a sense.  Those who don't follow the series will of course have a much more difficult time in understanding the characters and the overall story than someone who does follow the series.  Star-Trek, The X-Files and other such series are no different in this regard.
I feel that Pokemon can bring magic and a very powerful meaning without condoning violence to anyone who is involved about it.  Pokemon tells one that it is okay to dream and have goals.  Believe me, I cannot say that about too many other series in this day and age.",969494400,,1109,4.232227488151659

I always loved the pokemon series since it first came out.
Of course I own Pokemon: The first movie and Pokemon: Mewtwo returns so I knew that I needed Pokemon 2000 as well. I didn't buy it new but that was just fine since I expected light scratches on it which are really no issue to me.
What i was completely thrilled about was that not only did it come in earlier than expected but there were absolutely NO scratches on it at all which made me VERY happy!

Its full of stuff about being brave, being humane, helping the world and enviorment, helping your friends and making the choice to be good (will Team Rocket ever lean).

1283329,4,B00003CXLM,It's much better then the first film. The message about not doing things alone is much better and less back-handed then the message from the first one. The action is great. The comedy is solid. The animation is still first-rate. The Misty-Melody feud sub-story is refreshing and kind-of funny. The music is ok. The story itself is not great but pretty good. I give this movie a 8 and a half out of 10.,1283904000,,401,4.4324324324324325
1283330,5,B00003CXLM,"This move is an atention grabber from the start and it really lives up to the expectations of pokemon fans everywhere.
Ash gets a really big part in this movie unlike most of the others.
And you can see that the creators of this used a lot more special effects than they usually do on their movies.
There is actually a plot in this one too!
(or there seems to be!)
Anyways if your a die hard pokemon fan this is a movie that I'd recomend",1260748800,,437,4.093023255813954

1283332,4,B00003CXLM,"Pokemon The Movie 2000 is the second theatrical film for the Pokemon franchise.  Before the film, there is a short titled, ""Pikachu's Rescue Adventure.""  The actual film revolves around three Legendary Pokemon (Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres), and how a Pokemon collector is trying to capture all three of them in order to capture Lugia (the ""Great Guardian"").  Ash ends up being the ""Chosen One"" referenced in a legend, and it's up to him to save the day.

This DVD release of Pokemon The Movie 2000 has some special features.  First, there is an extra labeled as, ""Soundtrack Live.""  This includes live performances of Dream Street's ""They Don't Understand,"" Alysha's ""Dreams,"" and Youngstown and Nobody's Angel's version of ""Pokemon World.""  There is also a two-minute documentary about the making of the soundtrack, which includes interviews with Donna Summer and ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.  All of these extras were part of ""The Power of One: The Pokemon 2000 Movie Special"" that aired on The WB.  There are also theatrical trailers for Pokemon The Movie 2000 and for Pokemon The Movie 3.

Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this film.  The film runs for about an hour and twenty minutes, and the story utilizest his runtime well.  However, I'm a little disappointed that there isn't a way to be able to be able to choose to simply watch the ""Pikachu's Rescue Adventure"" short by itself on this DVD.

Any Pokemon fan should have this DVD release of Pokemon The Movie 2000 in their DVD collection.",1222214400,3,1497,4.869565217391305
1283333,5,B00003CXLM,"This is part 2 of 10 in rating the pokemon movies.  Pokemon the Movie 2000 is my favorite.  A lot of this harkens back to it's theatrical release when there was a lot of anticipation for gold and silver to be released and to see Lugia on the big screen, wow.  Looking back on it, I really like the mythology behind it.  Although it shares no real canon to the television series, I think that this movie made it seem on a grander scale.  Like the world was really in danger.  I don't know that I care too much for the title of the main movie, ""The Power of One,"" I think it gives too much away.  I also don't think that Ash truly was the power of one considering he had all the help he had.  I mean, he couldn't have done that by himself.  The true lesson seems to be that you need allies.  This is an overall great installment to the Pokemon movie franchise.",1200960000,,858,4.083832335329341

It starts with the three legenderies; moltres, zaptos, and articuno being captured and its up to ash to ""save the world"" lugia makes an appearance and a powerful one at that. the movie didn't fail to entertain and i reccomend it highly to any fan. its going on the shelf with the rest of my pokemon collection.",1182384000,,449,4.421686746987952

1283534,5,B00003CXLM,This is the second pokemo entry n the pokemon movie franchise.  Word  of  warning  this movie  has  some  pretty  intense  fighting  scenes  in  it. Not  as  bad  as  to  the  extend  the  first  movie  was  near  the  end.  Sad  to  say  they  have  been  not  been  properly  rating  kids  film  since  like  1989  when  all  dogs  g  to  heaven  1  came  out.  The  trailors  are  very  misleading  for  all  dogs 1  2  and  the  early  pokemon  movies. Pokemon  3  is  very  violent  as  well. Ash  almost  died  in  charizard  came  very  close  to  possibly  dying.  So  parental  persence  maybe  be  required  for  all  the  films up  til Jirachi  wish  maker.  So I  don't  recommend using IMDB  if  you  want  to  decide  to see  the  movie don't  they  tend  to  be  either  to  harsh  our  not  harsh  enough  usually. I  gave  this  a  five  star  rating  because  amazon  does  not  use  the  ten  star  system I  thought  giving it  a  4  would  be  to  harsh. I'd  give  it  and  8  out  of  ten  the  later  films  I  will  be  harsher  one  because they  made  a  really  dumb  decision  starting  during  pokemon 6  that  made  most  the  films  that  followed  after  word  not  as  enjoyable  but  still  enough  to  get  a  decent  watch. (as  for  why  the  pokemon  1  got  so many  bad  scores stuff  there  that  was  stuf ctu  out  there  was  in  pokemon 1 there  was  and  extend  opening  when  they  explain  that  mew II  was  one  of  5  other  clones  all  of  them  except  him died. Unfortunately  due  to  one  of  the  clones  being  a  little  girl  name amber of  one  of  the scientist  working  for  giovani  of  team  rocket  the  studio  changed  there  mind  and  cut  it  out. out  of  fear  most  like  that alot  of  religious  parents  would  complain  about  it  dimishing  the  films  finacial  success  in  theaters.  There  also  is  a  crude  humor  joke  near  the  end  of  pokemon  2000  the  film  so  parental  guidance  may  be  required  for  kids  under  12. look It has been along time since  ashes last adventure.  Brock has left the party temporaily he  would  appear  in  all  the  remianing  movie  up  till  after  Zorawk master of  illusion  after  that  he  was  written  out  due  to  multiple  cplaints  fans  had  about  him over  the  years. . For those of you did see they episode from the T.V. series Brook meet this really hot scientist named Professor Ivy and stayed behind to be here assiant  for  here unfortunatly something  never  explain  went  wrong  possible relationship  gone  wrng  he  returned  depress  at  ash house  in  the  very  beging  of  the  first  season  of  3  that  made  up  the  joto  aka  gen  3 ark. This movie featured a new charter a handsome pokemon artist named Tracey. Who joined as he begins his new journey in the organ island  this  happened  about  8  our  so  episode  into  season 2. This movie introduces some new pokemon an second evolved form of Slowbro called Slowking who  was  not  supposed  to  appear  to  gen  3  why  he's  in  the  movie I  have  no  idea. as I'm  aware  the  only  new  pokemon  supposed  to  make  and  apperance  in  season  2  was mariel.  and a new legendary bird called Lugiga. That is part fly/ part pyshic Who you don't she really clear until last 1/3  of  the  movie  which  is  one  of  the  reason  alone  with  the  min  villian  being  a  dumb  ass  not  very  evil  that  this  movie  also  got  a  crap  total  score on IMBD  o. f  4.8  out  of  tenn.  In this movie a pokemon collector causes unbalanced between the three legendary pokemon Zapados Articuno and Moltres when he tries to catch them for his collection not  knowing  of  the  tragic  conquesence  that  wil  result  do  to  his  actions.  This is the first time Team Rocket coroperates with ash and his friends out side of the Television episodes of  seasos  one  willingly.  They even put  team rockets old magic carp submarine in it which is really cool there's just one flaw with it. It is a foot power sub unless there feet are rotating on the pedals the sub won't movie. Ash does not get  turned  in  to  stone in this one. but there is a part near the end where he has a very nasty fall from several  feet  n  the  air  into  water  is  briefly  knocked out. Luckily he is not seriously injured. Can ash save the world and bring balance back between the three legendary birds or is the earth to be destroyed find out.,1130803200,2,4446,4.236530880420499
1283535,5,B00003CXLM,"The second Pokemon movie is really good.  In the plotline, an evil dastardly guy named Gelardan/Lawrence III (he was called ""Gelardan"" in the closed captioning, but someone said his name was Lawrence III, so I'm not entirely sure what his name actually is) decides to add the legendary birds Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres to his collection of rare items.  He thinks this way he can also collect another legendary Pokemon, Lugia, as well.  Of course, when he succeeds in capturing Moltres, he inadvertantly throws everything horribly out of balance.  (Whether or not he did it on purpose isn't entirely clear...)
Around this time, weather patterns are thrown out of whack and Pokemon everywhere are disturbed, so they are travelling to the source of the problem--Shamuti Island in the Orange Archipelago, which is, coincidentally, where Ash, Misty and Tracey currently are located.
Eventually, the group meets a girl named Melody and partakes in an annual festival of sorts.  Part of the festival involves an ancient ritual, and Ash is picked to play ""the chosen one"" in said ritual.  Little does he know he really IS the ""chosen one"", according to an ancient text, and he's supposed to save the world from Gelardan/Lawrence III.  Coincidentally, Lawrence III also read the text and misinterpreted it, which is part of why he's attempting to collect the Legendary Birds.  You'll understand once you see it.

This movie is really nicely done.  The special effects and facial expressions are of course great, and the voice acting is also nice.  I also especially like the part towards the end where Melody plays Lugia's song in its full glory--they really did a nice job with that.
Best of all, you get to see Team Rocket help out the good guys.
So in conclusion, this movie is really nice and is definitely worth purchasing, maybe even if you're not a Pokemon fan.
This movie is only missing one thing, unfortunately: Mewtwo.  :)

There is also a rather interesting mini-movie, ""Pikachu's Rescue Adventure"", wherein Pikachu and company go to rescue Togepi, with the help of an Elekid, and they find a lot of interesting things along the way.  Like with ""Pikachu's Vacation"", the only language spoken is Pokemon-speak (aside from Meowth).
I won't give away very much about it, except to say that I really like the dancing Bellossom.  ^_^",1124841600,3,2333,4.946153846153846
1283697,1,B00003CXLM,"Now that Disney is distrubuting almost all of Myazaki's films (The Cat Returns, Castle In The Sky, Porco Rosso, Spirited Away), so my question is ""Why buy this garbage?""

Parents should keep kids away from unimaginative, poorly animated, commercial-filled toxic waste like Pokemon. This is pure mind control for kids - teaching them to buy cheap plastic junk.

Show kids some quality Japanese Animation before its too late!",1119571200,2,423,5.205882352941177

It wasn't quite as good as the first but I still thought it was wicked.  The storyline is great.  It says if you try hard and believe in youself there is nothing you can't do.  I think pokemon has encouraged people of all ages from around the world that they are special and have the power to make change in the world.

1283699,5,B00003CXLM,"While the first Pokemon movie was weak and sadly overly cutsey at times, Pokemon 2000 holds an excellent plot, awsome action, beautiful animation, and overall quality entertainment.
The plot behind Pokemon 2000 is that an insane trainer has created a way to capture the Legendary Birds, Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.  By doing so he plans to lure Lugia out of hiding so he cna capture it as well.  Ash and the gang stumble upon this madman and they try to stop him.  Unfortunatly when they free the legendary Birds they go ballistic and so it is up to Ash and Lugia to stop them.
This works because it keeps both parents and kids entertained.  While it does lack the moral dilema that the First movie held, it does hold the attention much beter than the first.  IT's strong point is definetly action but it does hold a strong enough plot that it keeps everyone entertained.",1058745600,9,874,4.612903225806452

First, I will review the traditional 20-minute short ""Pikachu's Rescue Adventure""
This can be reviewed with on sentance: """"Pikachu's Vacation"" was better"". Skip it entirely. The only interesting scene is the ""Bellossom concert"".

The story? Oh man, it's great. It starts with the explanation of an ancient legend. The Titans of Fire, Ice and Lightning, are the bird Pokemon Moltres (Fire), Zapdos (Lightning) and Articuno (Ice). The Collector (voiced by Neil Stuart) is an evil man who collects Pokemon and Pokemon-related items (like his Mew card (similar to trading-card game)). The legend reads that if Zapdos, Moltres and Articuno are brought together, they will flush out the real prize of all this collecting: The Beast of the Sea, Lugia. Sadly, taking these Pokemon from their respective islands (Fire, Ice and Lightning Island) will throw the entire balance of nature out of whack.
While this is going on, good-ol' Ash (Veronica Taylor) with his old time pal Misty (Rachael Lillis) and new friend Tracey (Ted Lewis) are traveling the Orange Islands (home of those huge bird-like freaks) with another friend, Erin (Tara Jayne). While traveling, they get caught in a strange storm and blown to one of the Orange Islands, Shimouti Island. There, they are greeted by the island folk who are celebrating the Sea Festival. One of these folk is a friend of Erin's, Carol, who then introduces them to this year's Festival Maiden, Melody (Amy Birnbuam). Since Ash is a Pokemon trainer, they then decide that he is ""The Chosen One"" (guess they need one in a hurry) and explain to him that he needs to get 3 crystal balls from Fire, Ice and Lightning Island and bring them back to a shrine. Ash, Misty, Tracey, Melody and Erin set off to do so but are soon captured by The Collector in addition with Moltres and Zapdos. After finding out about his ""diabolical"" scheme, they team up with Team Rocket's Jessie (Lillis), James (Eric Stuart) and Meowth (Addie Blaustine) (they're out for Pikachu again) in order to ""save the world"".
The story may sound generic, but it ain't. Takeshi Shudo's scrpit and Michael Haigney's and Norman J. Grossfeld's adaption is much better than their work with ""Mewtwo Strikes Back"". The dialogue is well written and Team Rocket is actually funny! Even their puns are funny!! AND I HATE PUNS!!!
The animation is much, MUCH better than the first one's. The effects and CGI look great, and the graphics are lush and colorful. A delightful piece of eye-candy (more for me because I have a sweet tooth for lush graphics).
Also, it makes me feel good to know that there is some sort of romance going on between Ash and Misty (I always thought that they would make a cute couple ^_^). While there was a small and not so obvious seed planted that Misty has a secret crush on Ash when he died in the first Pokemon movie, here it becomes quite obvious with Melody constantly teasing Misty about it (but Misty keeps denying it so Ash still doesn't know). Shogakukan Video (the company that makes the movies), please make it happen when you start work on the 7th movie if it hasn't already happened in the 6th (it's just come out in Japan). I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who wants to see her, if not hugging, kissing, or holding hands with him, at least confessing her true feelings to Ash.
My only complaint is the use of some of the characters in the movie. Melody was a great character who was not given a big enough role, and The Collector and Tracey have absolutley no personality at all.
All in all: This is a great movie with a sharp script, wonderfull animation and the G rating that the first one didn't.

1283837,3,B00003CXLM,"In the second theatrical release of the Pokemon series, we are given nothing but an environmental disaster for Ash and friends to solve - and this makes it quite a bit less great than the first movie.  This would have been much better as a multi-part episode of the TV series.
If you're unfamiliar with the basics, Pokemon (short for ""POcKEt MONsters"") are creatures a little like those from this world, but with strange and unusual powers and abilities that they use for their masters - masters that can be either good or evil.  Ash and his friends train their Pokemon to fight battles with their enemies.  They travel all over the planet to collect new and unusual types of Pokemon.  They trap Pokemon in ""Poke Balls"" - a small device that hangs from a belt.  When Ash's enemies release their Pokemon to do their work, Ash and his friends release their Pokemon, and they have a big battle.
The environmental message in this story is just about shouted out loud and clear.  This heavy handedness in story and plot makes it less enjoyable to begin with.  Then, to make matters worse, there's a section near the beginning of the movie that almost comes right out and tells you the plot for the rest of the movie.  If I had know that this was the case, I could have turned it off right then.
Ash and his friends must save the three legendary bird Pokemon Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres from the clutches of an evil Pokemon collector.  But the ""evil"" of the collector is only superficial at best - we are given no reasons for his obsession with ""Gotta Catch Em All"" other than the collector's card that he both begins and ends the movie with.  He doesn't seem nearly as threatening as the menace of MewTwo.  And there's almost no resolution to his story - he is left with exactly what he stared with and does not seem to regret his evil ways, nor does he seem to care that he was ultimately responsible for the environmental disasters that faced Earth.
Meanwhile, Lugia must help Ash replace the three orbs on the island where they belong while flying through the fight between the three legendary birds and the environmental damage that they have created.  Ash's life is in jeopardy again, and after the first movie, you would think that the Powers That Be would come up with a more original plot.  What's worse is that the message is presented in such a way that it Cannot Be Ignored, which is always a plot device that I have hated.  There's not any story for parents to love in this one unless they're members of Greenpeace.
My favorite part of this movie was the few scenes where the original Team Rocket, Jessie and James, have a change of heart and must side with their former enemies Ash and friends.  I sometimes wonder why those two have never learned the error of their ways.  This was the only saving grace of this movie.
There's also another Pikachu cartoon in this one that fans of the TV show will enjoy, but parents will find a herd time making any sense of the Pokemon ""talk"".
Not nearly as highly rated as the first movie - in fact I only recommended it for Pokemon fans.",1052870400,3,3085,4.482142857142857
1283838,2,B00003CXLM,"First of all, the main problem with this Pokemon movie(in whatever version) was that it was too darned predictable. One of the main characters, Melody, practically sums up the whole movie from the start! Ash basically has to go find three ancient treasures in order to restore the peace which was disrupted by a greedy Pokemon collector, Lawrence III.
The english version(which sadly is the only language track, besides the french track, on this DVD) makes the movie even more unwatchable. 4Kids Entertainment really wanted to mess with the plot this time, making Ash's role 'bigger' by making him 'The Chosen One' just so they could put another message in the movie.
To make matters worse, they totalled the soundtrack again, replacing it with their MIDI junk. Luckily, there ARE some music scores in this movie that are good, namely the last scene's.
 The DVD has a lack of extra features, because the only ones here are some videos of some 'bands' and 'singers', a trailer for the 3rd film, and the short film, which was toyed with just like it's predecessor. Strangely, the movie doesn't have a widescreen mode, which is very irritating. Sadly, Warner Bros.' track record of Pokemon DVDs isn't looking too good. This movie may not convert non-Pokemon fans, but it will be an entertaining little ride for the fans.",1052697600,5,1317,4.879464285714286
1283839,5,B00003CXLM,"Although probably not met with as much praise by the critics as with the Pokefans, it was significantly better than the first film, Mewtwo Strikes Back. This may be a biased opinion, however, as Lugia is my favorite Pokemon, but Mewtwo is one of them as well.
Anyway, in this film, a Pokemon collector wants to capture the legendary bird Pokemon, Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres to flush out the big prize, Lugia. Unfortunetly, this tips the balance of power, and disrupts the weather around the world. Meanwhile, Ash, Misty and Tracey journey to a small island near to the island homes of the legendary birds and keeps up its old traditions with a yearly festival. The young girl who leads the tradition this year is Melody, who chooses Ash as the festival's ""Chosen One."" He is to travel to the islands to collect three elemental spheres and bring them back to the first island.
How this movie is better than the first (and the ones that follow, too, I might add) I will explain in numerous points:
First of all, the movie is less dark, and has a bit of a lighter mood. This can be good or bad, depending on how you like your Pokemon movies, but people who watch the anime series tend to like the lighter mood more.
Secondly, this movie explores more the possibility of Pokeshipping, which is the more-than-platonic relationship between Ash and Misty. The movie has many cute moments, like Misty geeting jealous over Melody kissing Ash, and Melody telling Misty how she will marry Ash eventually. There's even a Rocketshippy moment! (Jessie and James)
Third, the score to the movie goes way beyond what is possible in the anime series. I personally love the score, especially ""The Legend Comes to Life."" Yes, the movie's soundtrack still carries the pop songs, but keep in mind that the English version of Pokemon is geared mostly towards younger children.
Fourth, the movie explores more about how Pokemon interact and influence the enviornment and the people around them. Not like the first movie, which was mostly about how Mewtwo's injust treatment by Team Rocket caused it to ""go bad."" This movie proved that Pokemon control and keep nature in balance, and carries the underlying message of how destructive human beings can be to the enviornment with selfish ideas.
Fifth, the movie is just more engaging and exciting. The fate of the world rests in Ash's hands (and his competence as a hero). Team Rocket have a bigger and better part in the film, becuase they become temporarly changed and help Ash save the world. The battles between Lugia and the three birds and the Pokemon collector are more exciting. And also, there is more of what I deem as the most important aspect: character development. All of the characters change a bit (with the exception of Tracey), even if it is for just within the time of the movie.
All in all, Pokemon 2000 is my favorite of the 4 Pokemon movies, and continues to be a popular film among the Pokemon fans.",1050796800,11,2947,4.713178294573644

It's based on a lousy TV show which is based (VERY loosely)on a mediocre video game. The second time around, they decide to introduce a bunch of new pokemon which confuses things even more. How do you keep track of over 200 little critters? The annoying Ash returns and I found it hard to believe that this rookie trainer somehow saves the world. Here is where the movies and TV shows differ from the video games. A player trying to use a pokemon team identical to Ash's will without a doubt face defeat time and again. To win the game you need to pick a team thats a bit stronger than Ash's collection of weaklings (believe it or not, pikachu is not a very strong pokemon in the game).

1284006,4,B00003CXLM,"Many people criticized ""Mewtwo Strikes Back"" when the first Pokemon movie was released in the US, because in comparison with the excellent Japanese version it was a mess, missing out important things that explained about the characters (such as The Birth Of Mewtwo), and it had sloppy characterization.
  However, I'm pleased to say that this film is generally much better than the first Pokemon movie. The plot involves a Pokemon collector called Laurence III who wants to capture the three Legendary birds Articuno. Zapdos and Moltres - or the Gods of Ice, Lightning and Fire as they're called here. Unfortunately, this creates a huge problem with Earth's weather patterns, causing violent storms and snow, and it is left up to Ash to get them back, and return things to normal.
There are some little hints to the possibility of an Ash/Misty romance in this film - when Ash arrives on the island at the beginning of the movie, a girl called Melody kisses Ash on the cheek which makes Misty really jealous, as well as  some other cute moments.
Sadly, in spite of an improved plot I believe that, as before, the choice of music stands out as the film`s downfall and the producers haven`t learnt from the mistakes they made in the first film. Apart from a few exceptions (""The Legend Comes To Life"" is a wonderful track), this movie replicates the same pop-styled rubbish used in the First Movie. The remix of the TV theme song (""Pokemon World"" performed by Youngstown & Nobody's Angel) is absolutely horrible, with a scratchy beat and synthesized vocals. The campaign to ban vocoders starts here...
Next time round, I would like to see a better choice of music which is less pop-orientated, but I`m not holding my breath...
Overall though, in spite of the terrible soundtrack, this is a major improvement on the First Movie which I think any Pokemon fan should add to their collection.",987897600,11,1885,4.811728395061729

1284008,1,B00003CXLM,"What a pathetic edition to the pantheons of the world's movies. Sure, we have a ""movie"" cashing in on the unquestionable success of the Pokemon cartoon series, but I wonder just how many people actually stopped to realise the movie was simply an inflated episode of the cartoon? or perhaps even just three episodes strung together? This film... so badly that I'm not even going to give an account of the plot (if I did it would simply be a rambling along the lines of ""Charmander casts his fire spell on Some-Other-Irrelevantly-Named-Badly-Drawn-Japanese-Cartoon-Character"" and a simple repetition of this kind of thing).
The characters are unaddictive (there are way too many of them for starters), the plot trails off in about a thousand direction, the effects are every bit as bad as the cartoon and the language is so simplistic it is hardly going to accelerate children's learning processes (surely something like this designed for children should help them cope with comlpex language skills?).
Such a bad addition to the world of movies is this that it is one of the VERY few movies I haven't seen all the way through - I left after 40 mins to watch a real movie (I think it was Jaws). Okay, so its designed for kids. Big wow - so is the very successful, and far more impressive, Toy Story 2, and A Bug's Life, which appeal to all ages without the non-essential obsession with literally scribbled pictures of pointless magical creatures.
Avoid this movie at all costs. It is a waste of time, money, effort, attention and everything else, and there is ALWAYS going to be a better kids movie out there. Pixar looks pretty good, and you can never miss with Disney.
Oh, and I haven't just slated this movie because I don't like Pokemon, I did it because I genuinely believe it deserves it. The original Pokemon movie is marginally better than this and if you must see Baulbosaur and co. in battle on the big screen go and see Pokemon The First Movie.

It's no secret that Mewtwo Strikes Back was not well received, but to all those who criticised the first movie, this is the producer's way of getting their own back!
P2K is a superb film. It has the three basic elements that make a great film: it's interesting for its entire length, it actually as a plot (something that MSB lacked) and it has characters in it that can be related to. The dub, as in MSB, is excellent, and my thanks go out to Michael Haigney and all of the US production team, because they did a really great job with P2K, despite the odd bit such as the now infamous Slowking's ""I could use pants"" line.
The plot line from the original movie was maintained in the US edition, which I was pleased to see. There were no parts omitted this time (RE: The Birth of Mewtwo which was dropped from the US version of MSB, which explained so much about Mewtwo's background), and the characters retained the bulk of their dialog. My only gripe on the character side is the name of the villain - Laurence. When did you last come across a bad guy called Laurence?!
On the audio front, an excellent substitute for the original Japanese movie, although I was still not that happy about the choice of music in the movie (despite being much better than the music for MSB). I'd like to see less pop junk next time around. As for the score (BGM), as with MSB, I was really pleased with it. The hauntingly beautiful theme of Lugia and the atmospheric ""The Legend Comes To Life"" track near the end of the movie are my favourites.
So, a successful comeback after MSB. I just hope that the third movie, due for release in the US in the spring of 2001, will be just as good. P2K is certainly a movie to add to your DVD or VHS collection, and I also recommend the original Revelation Lugia movie from Japan.

Plus, Team Rocket wasn't acting their jerkish selves, and they helped Ash save the world. I recommend this video or DVD to any Pokmon fan.",975110400,,714,4.416666666666667
1284273,5,B00003CXLM,"This movie was by far better than the first one.  The dubbing was a little bit better, the music composed by the dubbers was good too, although I really wouldn't mind hearing the original score.  I mean why not, they keep it in the show.
This story had much more plot too.  This movie was not just stopping the evil collector, Lawrence III from completely destroying the Earth, but a little quest was added.  Ash was sent out to find special magical spheres, which would prevent the Earth from collapsing.
Team Rocket's good side finally appears in this movie.  It shows that they are really not evil, just misunderstood.
When I saw this in theatres, I saw rather annoyed looks on some parents' faces, knowing that a lot of them are simply driven nuts by this craze, but they seemed to be pleased after the end of the film.  This film isn't enjoyed by only Pokmon fans, but people who aren't fans of this show will really enjoy this movie, too!
I can't wait for Pokmon 3:  The Lord of the Unknown Tower!",974678400,,1003,4.448087431693989
1284274,5,B00003CXLM,"Yea, yea I know what you're thinking 'Another movie staring that idiot kid, when is the horror going to end' well technically not for another 2-3 years (max.). But instead of sitting on the sidelines giving all the pokmon dirty looks, why not enjoy the ride?
This is the absolute best pokmon movie/episode EVER! And for once the star of the show isn't entirly Ash, The glamorous members of team Rocket: Jessie, James and that adorable meowth have many cute scenes; They even have a 'good guy' motto that any self-respecting TR fan just CAN""T miss.
Still not convinced? okay. TR helps save the world by letting go of lugia's leg, yea . . . Team Rocket SAVES the world.
'I thought the movie was about ash saving the world, you know 'the power of one'
Yea right, this movie was poorly named, three people atually asist in saving the world
Ash Team Rocket Melody and I guess misty if you want to get technical.
OH! Another reason to buy this movie! Meowth alone is in this movie more then Misty and Tracy combined.
It also has cameos by a curtain female professoe, ash's mom, Professor Oak and every's favorite girl obcessed guy!",974419200,,1125,4.54679802955665
1284275,3,B00003CXLM,"I am part of a small minority, that is people who are at least fourteen, and still enjoy Pokmon. I have always found the message of Pokmon to be much more noble than that of other cartoon shows that currently penetrate into the youth's brains, and this movie is no exception.

 A young Pokmon trainer named Ash, and his traveling companions Tracee and Misty (not to mention all the Pokmon) are traveling throughout the Orange Islands, when a violent storm blows them off course. They land on an Island where they stumble upon an ancient ceremony, based on a legend of four great Pokmon. Ash arrives at just the right time to be selected the chosen one to perform in the ceremony, but soon discovers that the ancient legend is coming true due to a Pokmon collector who is capturing the four great Pokmon, shifting the balance of power on the planet.

 Both the DVD and the VHS version include the short ""Pikachu's Vacation"", a short tale involving only the Pokmon, who get lost in a large forest and must work together to get out.

 Both components of this package are definite improvements over the first movie, which played more like a collection of television episodes than a movie. The animation styling is improved, and the computer-rendered graphics only look mildly out of place as opposed to the first movie in which they were absolutely ridiculous. The third Pokmon movie, due out in US spring 2001, should be another grand step in moving towards really impressive animation (don't worry Pokmon moms and dads, there will only be four movies).

 I have not viewed the VHS version of the movie, but I did purchase the DVD version, and I was greatly disappointed. The DVD has no audio commentary by the directors, something I greatly enjoyed in the first movie, and has no Dolby Surround sound track. It does possess 5.1-channel audio in both French and English, but most DVD players' ability to convert 5.1-channel audio into two (or three) speaker audio is lacking. The DVD also has English and French captions. The French captions are in French, unlike the soundtrack, which is in Quebec-French, so they don't match up.

 The transfer of the film to DVD is good, the film source was very grainy with blues in theaters, and that shows up here as well, despite being shrunk from its original aspect of 1.77:1 to 1.33:1.  This does create for a few odd moments when you can't see who's talking because the frame was so wide. The DVD also includes selections from ""Pokmon Live"". I was seriously hoping for this to be better than what it was. It's a collection of four songs being performed live from the movie, and it's absolutely lousy. The performances were mediocre. At least it was well transferred.

 I personally would like to see a wide-screen version of both the first and second movie, and I think any DVD should have more features than this one does, especially a director's commentary.  Pokmon 2000 is an excellent movie, just don't expect too much from this mediocre DVD.",974332800,,2987,4.719230769230769
1284276,5,B00003CXLM,"Pokmon 2000  The Movie:  The Power of One
This movie starts with a little short called ""Pikachu's Rescue Adventure.""  Unlike the short which accompanied Pokmon The First Movie, Pikachu's Rescue Adventure contains substance as well as cuteness.  It focuses, as the name suggests, on Pikachu's adventure rescuing--Togepi!  The short treats the viewer to Pikachu's intelligence, bravery, and of course, cuteness.  Like the first short, it goes out of its way to show a wide variety of Pokmon, including four new ones, which I understand are named Hoothoot, Ladyba, Bellossom and Elekid.  Elekid, a new electric Pokmon, plays a major role after becoming friends with Pikachu through an exchange of electricity.  (Hoothoot and Bellossom now have played important roles in episodes of Pokmon: The Johto Journeys on television as well.)  You'll even finally get to see a Snorlax do something other than eat and sleep!
The Power of One itself seems substantially less dark than its precursor, yet manages to outdo the First Movie's tale of MewTwo versus Mew.  The Power of One Introduces us to a new Pokmon, a powerful Guardian of the Water named Lugia which is nearly as large as the three legendary birds--Moltres, Zapdos and Articuno--combined.  It's also nearly as powerful as the three combined.  I say ""nearly"" because, according to an ancient prophecy, without the help of the Chosen One all of its efforts to stop the three from fighting will come to nothing, ""making the world turn to ash.""  And who should be the Chosen One?  Well, as Misty realizes, the prophecy DOES say that the world will ""turn to Ash.""
As an added little bonus, the movie finally provides first names for Professors Oak and Ivy, and for Mrs. Ketchum, Ash's mom. It also gives two uproarious, albeit non-speaking cameo appearances by the original companion of Ash and Misty--Brock the Rock.  Fans of Brock, myself included, may find his limited role disappointing.  Fans of Tracey, Brock's replacement, may also be disappointed at his limited role in The Power of One.  Moltres fans might be disappointed that he isn't a good-guy like he was in his one appearance in the TV series, and at the way he's been drawn for the movie.  Misty fans, however, will revel in her pivotal role.
Team Rocket fans, perpetually hoping to find their heroes playing a role other than that of the inept butt of jokes, will find their hopes finally realized.  Team Rocket too plays a pivotal role in The Power of One, believe it or not, deliberately and through the creativity of Jesse, James and Meowth!  Ah Team Rocket, we always knew your tendency to ""think outside the box"" would pay off one day.
In addition to Lugia and Team Rocket's effectiveness, the movie offers something else new:  a new Pokmon called Slowking.  Slowking, the final evolved form of Slowpoke and Slowbro, resembles a Slowbro, but with the spiral Shellder on its head rather than on its tail.  Best of all, the Slowking can speak.  When you hear what he has to say, you'll be glad he can.  Lugia's no slouch at communication either--like MewTwo, he just psychically speaks in Ash's head.  Neat, huh?
The Power of One offers an amazing spectacle of color and animation.  The movie produces vibrant images, color and sound.  I found the music good too, although I must warn you that as with the first movie, most of the songs on the soundtrack appear only over the closing credits and have little to do with the movie itself.  At least more of the songs from the this soundtrack seem at least generally related to Pokmon.  You will definitely want to watch the closing credits, however, both to hear ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's ""Polkamon"" song and to see the second, hysterically-funny, cameo appearance by Brock.  If you like Pokmon you will like this movie; your little Pokmaniac (either the one you tuck into bed at night or the one hiding inside you) will love it.",974246400,40,3889,4.838124054462935
1284277,5,B00003CXLM,"This movie is really improved over the first one released last year (1999). It has more cool special effects and even the 15 minute short was much nicer then the first one.
Overall, any die-hard pokmon fan should get this movie.",974160000,4,228,4.585365853658536
1284278,5,B00003CXLM,"Out of the five Pokemon movies that have been released so far, this one is still the best.  The animation is spectacular (Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres were gorgeous, and the ""villain,"" Jirarudan looked cool, too), the plot is intriguing, it's action packed, and there are even some Rocketshippy moments for all of us TR fans -- there's something for everybody.  But what makes this the best of the Pokemon movies, in my opinion, is the substantial role that Team Rocket played.  Seeing Jessie, James, and Meowth portrayed as the clever, unselfish, corageous, heroic characters that they truly are and get the credit they so richly deserve is an extremely refreshing change of pace from the show.  So, if you're a Pokemon or Team Rocket fan, then this movie is a definite must-see!",970704000,,781,4.893939393939394
