3872707,5,B0028LOT7O,"I came to this set having seen the original PBS series, having seen re-runs, and, therefore, having acquired some familiarity with each episode. Nonetheless, I watched each of these, the first of Morse, with rapt attention. Apparently, Thaw had honed his skills in other television series and acting experiences to the point where he matched perfectly the difficult role of Morse, edgy, abrasive, near-alcoholic (putting it most mildly), emotionally distressed, lonely, unhappy, maladroit in social and sexual relationships, and, yet, committed, dedicated, empathetic, insightful, and brilliant at what he does. While we will have far more to see of Morse, and, while his weaknesses and strengths become more apparent over the years of the series, still, this first look at him, contains most of the elements that will remain during its entirety. Both Morse and Thaw are fully matured men when we meet them, men for whom there will be little change until the deterioration of old age, which neither survived to experience. ( Thaw died at age 60 from throat cancer.)
These are three typical episodes; they show both Morse and Lewis as they were and would remain. They show the Oxford which would be their base for the next 13 years.  Start here, and then move through the series, whether via DVD or through other means of accessing the shows which exist or will come to exist in the media.",1348272000,,1388,4.982758620689655

3872711,5,B0028LOT7O,"This is Set One of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.

I haven't read the Morse novels, but I'm a huge fan of the TV show. Inspector Morse has a total of 33 episodes originally broadcast over the 13 years of 1987 to 2000. And this is the beginning, our introduction to a man whom John Thaw, who plays Morse, describes in an interview as ""a poor policeman but a good detective"".

Throughout the ""Inspector Morse"" series, the opening and closing music theme usually spells out M.O.R.S.E. in Morse code. According to composer Barrington Pheloung, in ""The Making of Morse"", in some episodes the Morse code spells out the name of the murderer OR a cryptic version of the killer's name OR the name of an innocent person. If another viewer has a better ear than me, I would love to hear about your discoveries of a Morse episode where the theme music spells out something other than M.O.R.S.E. in Morse code!  (I've added a photo to this page of the code for M.O.R.S.E.)

In the Inspector Morse books, written by Colin Dexter, Sergeant Lewis is in his 60's. Kevin Whately was only 26 when he auditioned, but he was so perfect that he got the part for the TV series. Good thing, given that the series lasted 13 years, and we now get to see Whately's follow-up series, ""Inspector Lewis"" [&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Complete-Inspector-Lewis/dp/B0056031NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector Lewis</a>&nbsp;], which I also recommend.

This Set has 3 episodes, all originally broadcast in 1987, in the same order, as Series 1 (the British call them ""series"", instead of ""seasons""):
The Dead of Jericho
The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn
Service of the All Dead

THE DEAD OF JERICHO:
This episode shows us three of what will become Morse hallmarks:  He is unlucky in love. He doesn't give out his first name. And when Lewis accompanies him to the pub, Morse finishes quickly and says they have to leave before Lewis finishes. Fans also know that Lewis usually ends up paying for the drinks!
It starts with Chief Inspector Morse taking part in a sting on a car body shop. Unfortunately, his car is rammed, which makes him late to choir practice. He's got his eye on another choir member, Anne Stavely (played by Gemma Jones). He walks her home and she says, ""You know, I don't know your first name.""
Morse, ""That's right.""
Anne, ""So?""
Morse, ""I don't use it.""
""That's silly!""
""It's my parents who were silly.""

The second time he walks her home, he doesn't see it, but we do, as she checks in her bathroom and sees she has a positive pregnancy test. By then, we've met her spoiled manipulative protege as well as Mr. Jackson, her nasty handyman and Peeping Tom neighbor.

The third time Morse is at Anne's home, it's to pick her up for their choir concert. The door is open and he calls to her, but he eventually has to go alone. She never shows up, and after the concert he finds out why. She's been found hanging in her bedroom. Morse cannot believe that it could be suicide. Detective Sergeant Lewis asks an important question: ""Did Sophocles do it?""

Trivia: Jericho is an area of Oxford. The episode was written by Anthony Minghella, based on Colin Dexter's 5th Morse novel of the same name, originally published in 1981. Dexter has a walk-on in all but three ""Inspector Morse"" episodes. This time, he is a passerby in a scene with Morse and Ned Murdock. In this first episode, Lewis (played by Kevin Whately) is attached to Chief Inspector Bell, not Morse. But Bell is promoted at the end of the episode, moving up to Superintendent at another branch. This leaves Lewis to move over to work with Morse.

Morse has great trouble viewing Anne's body, not only because of his personal association with her, but because Morse has a phobia of dead bodies, which we see throughout the show. He also doesn't handle blood very well, and is scared of heights (hypsophobia) and flying (aerophobia).

THE SILENT WORLD OF NICHOLAS QUINN:
It starts with a cocktail reception at the Foreign Examination Syndicate.  Nicolas Quinn, who works at the syndicate, spends most of the reception trying to adjust his hearing aid. He leaves the reception with another employee, Philip Ogleby, telling Philip that Roope and Tom Bartlett are selling exam secrets.

The following Monday, Quinn's body is found at his home, and Morse is sure that it is murder. Does Morse's law apply? As he tells Lewis: ""You know Morse's Law? There's always a 50/50 chance that the man who found the body, did the deed.""

This is the first episode where we see Morse with one of his passions, crossword puzzles. He interviews Ogleby (played with excellent intelligence and slyness by Michael Gough), and finds out that Ogleby is Daedelus, a demon crossword setter who frequently bedevils Morse with his 5 Down.  But is Ogleby too clever?

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on Colin Dexter's 3rd novel of the same name, published in 1977. Dexter knew a bit about deafness. He was a grammar school classics teacher until 1966, when he was forced to retire by the onset of deafness. He then took a post as Senior Assistant Secretary at the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE). That's not quite the same as the type of examinations held by the Syndicate in this episode, but there are similarities. Colin Dexter has a walk-on in this episode. He's a man drinking during the opening credits, at the cocktail party.

Colin Dexter is a dedicated crossword puzzler himself. He named his two main characters after his favourite crossword compilers, Sir Jeremy Morse and Mrs. B. Lewis!

SERVICE OF THE ALL DEAD:
Morse and Lewis are called to the church of St. Oswald's. The body of church warden Harry Josephs lies in the vestry, stabbed through the chest. They figure the killer was a tramp named Swan, who was at the service, according to the few congregants who attended. Then Max (played by Peter Woodthorpe), the rumpled pathologist who admires Morse and meets him head to head, drops a bombshell. Josephs was dead from a large amount of morphine mixed with wine - before he was stabbed.

Curiouser and curiouser. Morse tells Lewis, ""I'm not supposing anything until I've had at least two pints of beer."" Another hallmark of Inspector Morse. A pint, as he says, helps him think.

Morse goes to the church to ask Vicar Lionel Pawlin to come down to the station for questioning. Then follows one of the most memorable scenes in the Morse canon, set to haunting music. (Which scene I won't give away.)

Trivia:  This is the first episode, but not the last, where we see Morse's fear of heights. This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on Colin Dexter's 4th novel of the same name, published in 1980. Dexter's walk-on is when he appears as a man standing by the woman with the bike, when Morse goes to see the Archdeacon.",1337126400,76,7147,4.835380835380835
3872712,4,B0028LOT7O,"The Dead of Jericho: We meet Morse for the first time, hankering after the pale and sweet-toned music teacher, Anne Stavely (the elegant Gemma Jones). Sadly, she meets a lonely and final demise. DOCTOR WHO fans rejoice: Patrick Troughton stretches his acting-chops as a creepy neighbor. We also meet the wonderful James Grout as Chief Superintendent Strange, and the lively, pitch-perfect Kevin Whately as Sergeant Robert Lewis; both inimitable characters remain to the end of the series, and thankfully, Lewis continues. More anon . . .

The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn: Beware from what cup you drink. But the dead man's whisky shouldn't go to waste, as Morse decides, declaring to Sergeant Robert Lewis that he deserves it, he's had a shock. Lewis continues to resist Morse's offers of breakfast beer, and after work visits to pubs. Morse is drawn to the charms of Monica, perfectly played by Barbara Flynn. ""The Silent World"" features subterfuge surrounding examination secrets, red-herrings abound, and much ado about butter ensues.

Service of All the Dead: In a bucolic country church, a church warden is found skewered, more mayhem occurs in and around the church. As the bodies accrue, Morse becomes desperate to solve the case, and absolve his own credibility.

Inspector Morse turns out not to be the prig one expects, his opera loving ways are authentic, not off-putting, as is his love for rich ales. He's intelligent and thoughtful, misunderstood and complex.

2. I simply cannot like Morse! Live the books, adored "" Endeavor"" & inspector Lewis , but Morse seems rude, condescending ( not in a great way, but annoyingly so) the female in each is somehow romantically linked to him & this appears forced , false and unlikely ( especially since he's a pro & most are suspects) he's very OLD and not the least bit "" sexy"" or desirable.
3. The faux "" class"" doesn't wear well on him as it does on Hathaway ( who obviously is a bit shy by his Oxford past & quite loveable)

3872757,5,B0028LOT7O,"the late john thaw who unfortunately died at age 60 of cancer, was perfect as morse.  for those of us who have read the books, we regarded this as no small feat to achieve.  morse is older, cantankerous, intelligent, short tempered, has a way with women but prefers all the wrong ones.  this is a character with many layers and nuances and thaw renders them all. whatley is perfect as the much sunnier everyman, lewis. the mysteries themselves are all complex and well written.  e first episode here was written by the late Anthony Minghella, who went on to win the Oscar for THE ENGLISH PATIENT.

for those of you who are just starting out with either morse or lewis, you need to understand what a juggernaut of UK tv this has become involving novels and now THREE successful mystery series. it all started with the Morse novels written by colin dexter. i have read all of them and they are all excellent. the first tv series, this one, was made from these novels and was excellent as well. then tv decided to keep going even though there were no more novels to use. the first spin off was LEWIS, based on Morse's sidekick in all of the novels and the first tv series. he was given a brainy sidekick who could understand the eggheads at oxford, just like morse did. this series was a big hit as well. perhaps the biggest surprise though was the most recent series, ENDEAVOUR, which covers Morse as he starts out his career in the police in the 1960s. This series is utterly fabulous and the name comes from morse's hated first name.

the attraction of all three of the series begins with setting murders in Oxford England, right in the midst of Oxford University. the intellectuals of course dominate at Oxford and their alumni are the big people in the Uk. its only true rival is cambridge. the police are unwelcome outsiders. lewis exemplifies being an outsider as he never went to university, much less oxford. morse did go to Oxford but did not finish. he was bright enough but a love affair gone bad derailed him. at that point he joined the police. everyone at oxford looks down on them as the police, thinking they are simpletons, but they can compel cooperation if not respect while solving cases. this premise has fueled all three series.

this was the order i have done all the books and tv: the Morse tv series, the Morse novels, the Endeavour tv series and last the Lewis tv series. this worked for me but if you are an ardent reader it might be better to start with the Morse novels by colin dexter.

Is it just me or does this not seem like a guy to avoid rather than root for? And yet the quality of the writing is excellent throughout the series, especially in showing Morse's flaws, and more especially in showing that he's often aware of these deficiencies. And naturally his reaction is often ""sod off."" The Inspector Morse movies succeed exactly because of the title character's flaws and their resistance to following many of the tried & true conventions of police who-done-its. We see that Morse has kind of fallen into this job and now he can't seem to extricate himself from it. He'd much rather be in a pub working on a crossword or driving his Jaguar listening to classical music. He'd probably have quit a long time ago but for the fact that the pay underwrites his habits and that he just can't stand not solving a crime. Nothing exasperates him more than being at a standstill in an investigation, as he is fond of complaining to the ever patient Lewis. In all these ways Morse might be detective fiction's most stellar anti-hero, succeeding in not only solving the crime but doing something even more impressive -- getting us to root for him.",1369872000,14,1787,4.640378548895899

3872783,5,B0028LOT7O,"I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Complete-Inspector-Lewis/dp/B0056031NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector Lewis</a>) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting. This DVD set contains three early Morse episodes:

The Dead of Jericho
In this first episode in what would become a long-running series, Chief Inspector Morse falls for one of the singers in a local choir (of which Morse is also a member). Her name is Anna Stevely (played by Gemma Jones who first impressed me in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duchess-of-Duke-Street-Episode-1-1/dp/B000KBEEDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duchess of Duke Street Episode #1.1</a>) and she lives alone, making a living as a piano teacher. Morse tries to gently court her, but he senses something is not quite right, not that this puts him off. Well, the romance is short-lived as Anna is found dead, hanging in her kitchen. Is the death suicide, or is it murder?

Morse applies himself diligently to figuring out who Anna really was, and makes some startling discoveries. Anna used to be married and had a child; she also had an affair with her superior at a company she used to work for; there's a rather eccentric student of Anna's who appears to have stolen money from her; there's the peeping tom sleazy neighbor; etc. In what would become trademark Morse, viewers are left trying to figure out who the perpetrator is, and this is never easy as the list of suspects is usually long, and there are red herrings aplenty.

The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn
From the opening scenes of The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn, viewers are in for a wonderful viewing experience in one of my favorite Morse episodes. Nicholas Quinn is a hard of hearing (almost deaf) examiner working for the Oxford Examinations Syndicate. At the beginning of the show, he is shown desperately attempting to fix his hearing aid in order to participate in conversations at a party. Unknown to some, he is also taking lip-reading lessons, which enables him to figure out what certain people at the party are saying. This involves the selling of highly classified examination papers.

Well, not surprisingly, Nicholas Quinn turns up dead, murdered via cyanide poisoning. Inspector Morse and DS Lewis get involved in this case, and Morse's love of crosswords plays an important role in this case. He discovers a fellow crossword lover amongst one of the men working at the examinations syndicate (portrayed brilliantly by Philip Gough), a fact that delights Morse no end, until this person too turns up dead!

Then there's a little romance sub-plot (Morse and his women!) involving a lady working at the syndicate. Morse is attracted by her beauty and intellect, but he also suspects she is keeping something important from him, and works to puzzle this out. But will it be too late? This is vintage Morse which can be viewed several times over!

Service of All the Dead
This is the third episode in the Morse series, and is quite a convoluted plot. It is also rather interesting in that the body count is rather alarming - six dead, five murdered! A church warden is found murdered, the setting being a serene country church. As Morse and Lewis investigate, Morse finds himself drawn to one of the potential suspects, a rather enigmatic woman who also happens to help out with cleaning duties at the church. Morse tries his hardest to get close to her, but finds his attention being gently rebuffed, though there is clearly some chemistry between the two.

This episode is rather intense in that Morse's personal feelings are very much involved; he gets so close that his very life is threatened at one point; and, as a point of interest, viewers discover that Morse is afraid of heights!",1350777600,,4463,5.173130193905817
