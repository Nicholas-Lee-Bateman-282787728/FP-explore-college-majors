8184844,3,B000OFORMI,Not as informative as I expected. Very boring format. Expected more footage on this gorgeous breed. Training to stop from pulling etc. Very boring format.,1379721600,,154,5.2
8184845,2,B000OFORMI,"We were very disapointed with this video.  It was cute, but VERY simplistic!  It appeared to be shot on an extremely limited budget!  It did not give much in-depth information at all, as the description would suggest, and it just kept showing the same puppy, so we didn't get to see other examples of the breed, or even what an adult springer is like.

This would maybe be okay for a young child to watch in preparation to getting a puppy, but it really isn't worth the price!",1231286400,7,476,4.375
