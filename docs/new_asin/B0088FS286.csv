5140710,3,B0088FS286,Mostly just talk on 2 CD's. 1 DVD in set that is quite interesting. Great if you want to just hear his speeches.,1367366400,5,112,3.9130434782608696
5140711,5,B0088FS286,"Always a hero and an inspirational leader when needed most. A wise, witty, wonderful, and charming man of immense talent and knowledge. A totally unique man from a long line of strong leaders. I enjoyed all of the film, very well-done, w/an amazing cast of characters: Roosevelt, Stalin, Eisenhower, DeGaulle, and the many thousands of brave soldiers, sailors and underground fighters who won the war.",1361145600,9,401,5.184615384615385
5140712,5,B0088FS286,This is a quick brief summary of the life of Winston Churchill.  It doesn't get into the weeds in detailing the minute details of his life but rather gives a good overall picture of the man's life.  It doesn't hurt that they also use recordings of his speeches and it is narrated by Orsen Wells.,1360022400,9,295,4.345454545454546
5140713,5,B0088FS286,"This 2 CD and 1 DVD set of ""Churchill: The Finest Hours"", is a superbly crafted commentary.  Orson Wells' naration is a delight.  This three disc set is a must for any serious Churchill afficionado",1359331200,16,197,4.6

5140716,4,B0088FS286,"Very interesting, if somewhat frustratingly limited documentary biography of Winston Churchill. It's not really the film's fault. It's well made and intelligent. It's just that Churchill lived such a full and fascinating life, that trying to jam it all into an under 2 hour film means that much has to be ignored or sped through.

So in most areas we get the Reader's Digest version. Only the war years get a little more detail. But we get almost nothing about Churchill the human being, the husband, the father.

Huge changes in his political career are handled with a few sentences and a couple of images.

Yet I was never bored, and still ended up knowing much more about both Churchill and Britain in the war years than when I started.

A worthwhile film that spurred me on to learn more.",1449273600,3,792,4.635714285714286

5140719,3,B0088FS286,"I knew this documentary well growing up, and it ran again fairly heavily in the 1970s for the Churchill centenary. It has a fairly involved history -- back in 1960, American producer Jack Le Vien had the full cooperation of Churchill and his family, and the BBC on board for a considerable part of his budget, for a multi-part documentary called The Valiant Years, which aired in 1960/61, And during production, there were shivers down the spines of the BBC management, because Le Vien refused to adhere to their standard of using only actual footage of events referred to -- and, in addition to substituting footage from the wrong wars and eras, he even allowed on at least one occasion for an actor to replace actual participants on camera for what were implied as authentic interviews. (His excuse was that the figure being interviewed had fallen ill on the scheduled date, so they fudged it with an ""implied"" authentic interview of a substitute). But Le Vien had control, and the BBC had committed itself, and the documentary ran, and was well-received by the public.

This film was made from much of the same historical footage and material shot in the Churchill home that went into The Valiant Years, but has Orson Welles narrating and Patrick Wymark (rather than Richard Burton) reading words by Winston Churchill. It's a feature film, 116 minutes, and is much better known in the United States than Le Vien's earlier Churchill documentary. The origins and provenance of this DVD edition are a little suspect -- there seems to be no licensing information anywhere on the package -- as the film-to-video transfer is fair to good, but no better, with some serious digital artifacts at some points indicating a less-than-optimal source. It's okay to look at, and the sound is nice and clear, but it's nothing special for quality, and there's only a single chapter marker for the whole documentary. And it's odd that the film is edited so there are no opening credits -- just end credits. The accompanying CDs of Churchill's speeches are a nice bonus.",1437004800,6,2054,4.851851851851852

5140721,4,B0088FS286,Very interesting video but hard to manage as it is one continuous collection of old news film--no ability to scene select so you must watch the whole thing. The speeches do give a good feeling of how Churchill managed the war. I think it is one of those things you have to watch a few times to really get the max. benefit. It helps to have a good understanding of British history!!,1427760000,6,381,4.305555555555555

8526109,5,B0088FS286,"Although Orson Welles, Patrick Wymark, and Sir Winston Churchill merit top billing for this fine documentary, not to be forgotten is the writer of the screenplay, Victor Wolfson.  Mr. Wolfson also played a major role in selecting the documentary footage that is so skillfully woven through this film.  In the art of movies and television it's easy to forget - as my father used to say - that without a writer to deliver a good screenplay you have nothing.  In THE FINEST HOURS, the voice-over narrative is concise and dramatic.  The language of the screenplay enhances but never gets in the way; it works seamlessly with the film's often stunning and rare visuals, and achieves an excellent harmony with the words of Churchill himself.  The film is a fast-moving, dramatic, economical but complete overview of Churchill's marvelous life and times.",1529020800,,847,5.021428571428571

that now.  I'll take it into a local shop and see if they can make it work.  Can't comment on the movie itself as I haven't seen it.

8526113,3,B0088FS286,"This DVD has plenty of interesting historical footage you don't see in a lot of other documentaries, and also speeches and commentaries in Churchill's own voice. The storytelling feels a little dry, and (not surprisingly) reminds me of many other British documentaries from quite a while ago. So, it could have been more entertaining and engaging, but definitely has good historical material.",1514332800,,392,5.338709677419355
