6656663,1,B00NH34HLU,I'm a Huge fan of the show but a total rip off from the publishers/manufacturers making a huge profit off of this seasons. I wasn't sure why this season was costing $50-60 when the other seasons are only $20-30!  There are only 3-4 episodes on one disc and it's not even the entire season! It's only half of the season and the last episode on the last dvd leads up to nothing. You have to spend another $50-60 for the last half of the season! Who spends $120 for one season of a tv show? What a waste of money!,1438300800,17,510,4.1

6656665,1,B00NH34HLU,Very disappointed!  There were many repeat episodes from Season 2.  I already own Season 2 and didn't need to spend $59.00 to get it again.,1434931200,7,139,4.52

6656669,1,B00NH34HLU,"I don't understand how there an be repeat episodes from season 2? Way over priced. Only 17 episode, with repeats from season 2.",1428796800,16,127,4.565217391304348
6656670,5,B00NH34HLU,"Pricey.  But manufactured on demand, its worth it for the quality.",1426809600,,66,5.0
8678152,4,B00NH34HLU,I would buy all the seasons if the price was reasonable. It certainly isn't worth more than $10 a season maybe $15.  I own seasons 1 and 2 but WILL NOT pay these ridiculous prices for the rest.  Drop the prices and your sales will increase. I see Im not alone!,1517788800,,260,4.078431372549019
8678153,3,B00NH34HLU,Total ripoff. Season 3 came out shortly after season 2 in the 2012 2013 season I believe so no reason for it to be so pricey. Id consider buying it if it was otherwise not so pricey! Please lower the price please!!!!!,1516320000,,217,4.190476190476191

8678159,1,B00NH34HLU,Who's bright idea was it to price this thing so high? This is one volume and it's almost 60 bucks. I was happy to buy season one at $9.55. That's reasonable. But almost 60 for one volume and it's not even blue ray??? If I buy both volumes it'll be 120 bucks. It's not like Beeyonce is in it!!! This is ridiculous. There has to be some kind of mistake. There are critically acclaimed shows that are a lot cheaper. I can't imagine paying 10 to 12 buck for each dvd.,1457222400,7,463,4.0989010989010985
8678160,1,B00NH34HLU,I want this season but I will never pay that much for it!  Looks like I'll have to wait a few years.  Duh.,1449792000,6,106,3.5652173913043477
