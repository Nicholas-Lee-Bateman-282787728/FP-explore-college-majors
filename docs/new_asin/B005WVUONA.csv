4899978,5,B005WVUONA,"Ok, there are really great runners-up like To All A Goodnight and Black Christmas (original) but just the body count alone plus the greatest de-penising ever captured on film and now in the best picture quality ever is all one can ask for. Seriously this release has a very clear picture. If it ever hits Blu-ray it might be even better but I will gladly accept this for now. Anyway, this is going for 15 - 20 bucks as of this date and it is definitely worth it. Not just the greatest Christmas slasher of all time but maybe even the best slasher of all time. The story goes like this: Somebody has a fetish for going around and killing guys dressed up as Santa in Bloody Ol' England. Plenty of suspects abound. What's cool is the shear number of these fake Santa who get slayed and in many gruesome and creative ways. This was still 1984 when it was allowed to show a great deal of gore and violence and this movie really benefits from that. There are a couple of extras on here about the producer and about the production. I've got to state it again, the picture quality is amazing. See it for yourself if you DARE!!",1341360000,6,1118,4.328571428571428
4899979,3,B005WVUONA,"Taking place in some of grimiest streets to be found in all of London, the movie tells the story of what happens when a razor-wielding psycho decides to kill anyone dressed up as Santa Claus.  Luckily for him, it's the Christmas season so the streets are literally crawling with potential victims.  Can a dedicated police detective (played by Edmund Purdom, who also directed the majority of the film before the producers took it away from him) solve the murders?  Will the sex trade worker who witnessed one of the murders manage to escape the killer?  And, most importantly, why don't people just stop dressing up as Santa until this killer is caught?

As you might be able to guess from the synopsis above, Don't Open Till Christmas doesn't always make a lot of sense but that's okay.  That's part of the film's odd charm.  Don't Open Till Christmas is a fast-paced and rather mean-spirited slasher film and, if you're a fan of the old school exploitation and grindhouse films of the late 70s and early 80s, you'll find a lot to enjoy here.  And if you're not -- well, then you probably wouldn't be considering buying this film in the first place.

I should add that both the picture quality and the audio quality on this DVD are not the best.  However, it's not bad enough to serve as a major distraction and considering that this film was made to be seen in the old grindhouse theaters of 42nd Street, the film's rough edges actually add to the experience of watching it.

Finally, Caroline Munro shows up about halfway through this film playing...herself!  She's only in the film for a little over five minutes but still; she makes any film worth watching.  She even sings an amazingly dated disco song.  Now, seriously, what fan of exploitation cinema could possibly say no to that?",1326499200,5,1789,4.674121405750799
4899980,4,B005WVUONA,"I appreciate Mondo Macabro's new transfer and uncut version of DOTC.  The film print isn't perfect, but a movie like this was never a thing of beauty, so it's not Mondo's fault.  The promised 14 amazing kills on the box is a bit of a stretch, but there's four kills that manage to impress.  The movie isn't perfect, because the plot meanders a lot between many characters, but by the last thirty minute home stretch, this proves to be an okay slasher movie.  The last scene is pretty good too.  I won't give too much away, but if you're a collector, you can't go wrong buying this.  If you're a casual fan, please, rent it first.",1323475200,6,629,4.379310344827586
4899981,2,B005WVUONA,"Yes, nothing says Christmas like a series of gruesome Santa murders carried out in dark allies, peep show booths, and other sordid locations.  Don't Open Till Christmas definitely isn't for the kiddies - unless, of course, your little angels hate Christmas and long to see a whole series of Santas (most of them drunks or perverts or both) slain in North Pole-cold blood.  The film has most of the ingredients of a decent B-movie horror flick: blood, gore, and nudity - but it fails quite miserably.  Don't go looking for a compelling plot because this film is a mess.  With exploitation and skin flick veterans scattered here and there among the crew, a virtual revolving door into the director's office, and two years of re-shoots and re-edits, one could argue that Don't Open Till Christmas was cursed from the very start.  Those who sit through the whole film may also feel as if they've been cursed themselves - by the god of bad movies.

Someone apparently got lumps of coal in their stockings every year of his childhood because no Santa in London is safe.  A Santa can't even take in a private nudie show or answer the call of nature without getting slashed, strangled, speared through the head, or even castrated.  New Scotland Yard is baffled and held increasingly to the fire with each daily killing.  The closest thing they have to a suspect early on is the weird, lazy boyfriend of one rich victim's daughter (Belinda Mayne).  This is the kind of guy who tries to trick his girl into doing a little spur-of-the-moment ""modeling"" with a tramp being photographed by one of his lecherous friends.  The killer has more respect for women than this troll.  Inspector Harris (Edmund Purdom) is on the case, but his underling Sergeant Powell (Mark Jones) gets a few ideas of his own during the investigation - thanks largely to an exceedingly strange ""journalist"" who turns up several times out of the blue.  The film does succeed at raising a tad of suspicion among several characters as to who the killer really is, but that's pretty much all it succeeds at doing.  I seriously hope no one actually wants to hear Carolina Munro perform a terrible disco number.

Don't Open Till Christmas has only two things going for it.  One is the actual acting ability of Edmund Purdom.  This guy's sort of the quintessentially unknown yet familiar British actor who brings decades of acting experience and a serious air to everything he does.  The other is Kelly Baker, who plays the ""Experience Girl"" who witnesses one Santa slaying and finds herself in quite a sticky wicket with the killer toward the end.  I'm just realizing that her stripper character never actually shed any of her clothes, but I really liked this actress for some reason.

His long career of acting experience notwithstanding, Edmund Purdom was no great shakes as a director.  He apparently realized this himself, turning over the director's chair to script writer Derek Ford.  Ford, a veteran director of sleazy sexploitation films, apparently raised the seedy factor of the whole movie but quickly bowed out as well, leaving editor (and former sex cinema owner) Ray Selfe to try and pick up the pieces and - with a number of re-shoots - actually cobble something resembling a movie out of the whole mess.  That's why you have a seemingly important character like Dr. Bridle being mentioned in the script but never actually appearing in the movie.

Don't Open Till Christmas?  My advice is to wait until Christmas, and then keep on waiting - forever.  Some things are better left unopened and forgotten.",1230076800,2,3573,4.81639344262295
4899982,5,B005WVUONA,"I was reading a Christmas triva book and they had this film in there. It sounded like a good movie, so I checked it out to see if it was on dvd. The price is still up, even for a used copy. However, its well worth the price you pay for the film. The story is simple and I liked the flow of the film, and there is plenty of good kills. I'd check it out but here are a few flaws I noticed with the film

The picture is viewable but could have been cleaned up a bit.

There a few scenes that cut away. Since this is my first time viewing this film, I do not know if this version is edited of content.

Other then that, the film is fine. I like the trailers for older films and wish they could have added that as well.",1229990400,8,714,3.778523489932886
4899983,2,B005WVUONA,"""Don't Open Till Christmas"" is a generic anti-Santa Claus slasher film starring Edmund Purdom and Alan Lake, with a lunatic killing the Christmas spirit all over London in inventive and gruesome ways. The special effects are extremely lame, though, so the opportunities for genuine fear are few and far between, with the stabbing being among the least realistic in recent film history; the Santa urinal horror was novel, but equally bogus.

The film has a couple of interesting twists, even though they weren't particularly original, with the conclusion being easily guessed. The acting is above average for this genre and budget, with Edmund Purdom turning in a decent performance as Inspector Harris, and Alan Lake doing well as the creepy Giles. I was also impressed with the lovely Kelly Baker as the unlikely heroine who sees the film through to the final major plot point. There are some detractors here, too, though. The background action for the film is often banal, most notably the extraordinarily painful musical stage act, although the world's stupidest police chase made me roll my eyes involuntarily.

Completists of the Santa-as-horror-film-icon genre will like this film, but it drags quite a bit and suffers from mundane predictability.",1204848000,4,1253,5.2288557213930345
4899984,2,B005WVUONA,"There really is no excuse for this terrible transfer. Poor picture transfer is soft and barely above my VHS version. The sound is even worse-an annoying buzz runs thru the last half of the movie?! I tried to find info about the company that released this but couldn't. They must know what a embarrassing job that was done.
Bottom line is this is a rip-off even at half the price. If you have a VHS version keep it and save your $$$.",1194825600,5,432,4.280487804878049
4899985,4,B005WVUONA,"First off I would like to say that the picture quality of this is not the greatest (fullframe transfer,7 out of 10). The audio is also below par (constant crackling). There are no bonus features aside from an optional scene selector and a pics gallery of frozen frames from the film.
Even with these various handicaps this film was still able to charm it's way into my heart. A masked mad man is killing off anyone dressed as Santa Claus. There is plenty of gore, a high body count, and some beautiful naked women. It's a fantastic 80's slasher film. If you hate Christmas this is a special treat not to be passed up.",1192406400,30,617,4.421052631578948

Dont Open Till Christmas (1984) *
D: Edmund Purdom
C: Edmund Purdom, Caroline Munro, Alan Lake, Belinda Mayne
P: A serial killer targets any and everyone that just happens to be wearing a Santa Claus outfit during the Christmas season.

What are two of the things most commonly associated with a slasher? (1.) Death sequences (2.) A final girl or in some cases a final guy. Don't Open Till Christmas gets the death sequences part right as it features some brutal and effective murders. What it gets wrong is that the film documents one murder after another. There are no common characters linked to each of these sequences other then a person in a Santa Claus outfit. There is no character to get to know. There is no one to care about. There is no one to sympathize with.  There is no one to identify with. There's just death, death and more death. After awhile it all gets rather gloomy and repetitive. Slashers need to engage the viewer and make the viewer either hope for a character's death or survival. Here, we know the outcome of what each scene is going to be, so there really is no point. [R] 86 mins.",1387929600,,1222,4.570776255707763
4899994,3,B005WVUONA,"This movie holds surprisingly high amounts of nudity and cheap gore. It doesn't try to be serious, and it especially doesn't seek out to enhance the Christmas mood. Instead it seems more determined to give young males presents by having naked young woman flash their assets, while pleasing B-movie hounds with it's odd gore, strange story, and basically random violence, all the while trying to make a tad bit of sense.

The effects aren't top notch but they're watchable. With all the deaths going down, it's apparent that if you're planning a career as Santa Claus, this film could make you think twice. I've already mentioned above what should be taken as apparent weaknesses, but for this review I'll be checking the list twice, all for your own merry fun. The killer does some pretty stupid moves; the movie wouldn't work otherwise right? The script, penned with spirit by Derek Ford, works for the type of film it is but of course has flaws, and at time the pace lags a bit.

 The score is more mind numbing than thrilling, and the ending explanation for the killer's reasoning seems a bit forced and unbelievable, but hey, it's yet another killer Christmas movie and beggars can't always be choosers. Overall, I doubt anyone would love this film, but many will like it for what it is. There's always a shortage of holiday related slaughter flicks, so I suggest you watch them all so that you have theme related horror laying around to view when the relatives impose as December rolls around.

Maybe when your spirits are a bit down and your pockets are empty, when the kids are screaming to open yet another early present and the in-laws are on the plane coming for that yearly visit, you'll be able to get into the Christmas slaughter mood that much easier. Trust me, Don't Open Till X-mas can help. But just in case, have some extra eggnog laying around.",1379635200,4,1863,4.6880733944954125
4899995,3,B005WVUONA,"The movie is awfully bad, actually it contains so much plot holes and logical problems that it becomes laughable and extremely entertaining. Characters are moronic and don't have very sane reactions considering a killer is on the loose. However, about the final girl there is a nice twist near the end (e.g., the hooker become the final girl, which is not what we see in typical slasher). I would not recommend this one for horror fans because it's not scary at all, but comedy fans will certainly enjoy.",1363305600,2,504,4.738636363636363
8488130,1,B005WVUONA,"Worst quality film transfer I have ever seen (Mutant Sorority edition). Unwatchable. Waste of my money. Says ""digitally remastered"" on the cover but that is a bold face lie.",1514246400,,173,5.0
8488131,1,B005WVUONA,"Can't say whether or not I enjoyed this film because the picture quality was the worst I have ever seen, and believe me, I have seen some badly done films in my time. It's too murky to be able to tell what is happening throughout the film.",1503619200,,239,4.1063829787234045
8488132,4,B005WVUONA,"You get a lot of sleaze royalty in one film with Don't Open Til Christmas. Derek Ford, Dick Randall, Edmund Purdom, and a bunch of dolly bird trollops you've seen get them out in a million other British horror, crime, and sex comedies before this or at least they look like the girls in those films. It's not an insult. It's a compliment. The film lands squarely in the comfort food camp of low grade, quickly made horror films. Basic premise, it's Christmas and men dressed as Santa are getting murdered. It leads to a part time softcore or ""glamour,"" if you prefer, photographer becoming a person of interest as a Santa slasher.

It's an interesting film because the girls are there mostly to look good and get naked. None of them are really there to be horrifically murdered. It makes the film feel a lot classier than it is. It's also not nearly as tense or scary despite the terrifying toll it's taking on the Salvation Army and toys for good deeds businesses. Turns out killing men lands more squarely in the funny camp. Especially when men are wearing Santa outfits that fit poorly. Despite having Derek Ford writing, the movie doesn't feel horrifically bitter or mean. Mostly cause the girls are getting off the hook and doing what they're good at if we're being honest.

It's not a genius film but it's a fun one. The DVD package is just fantastic. It's packed with a ton of great extras and they add a ton of context and history to the whole thing if you're not already in the know. Mondo Macabro always keeps up the high standards on this. One of the best customer care companies out there when it comes to little obscure films like this. Best of all, they're surprisingly well priced.",1493424000,,1696,4.53921568627451

Edit: To clarify I bought the ""Mutant Sorority Presents"" edition of this movie.  It seems the same reviews show up for this product but there are 2 different editions.  The Mutant Sorority edition is about half the price compared to the other edition and clearly I got what I paid for. I read the top review who commented that it wasn't a top quality transfer but decent, I have to assume that review purchased the other edition and I was misled into thinking the Mutant Sorority edition would be decent. It seriously isn't even watchable, the move is so dark and blurry.  I'm super annoyed I waited an entire year to watch it just to find out it's a piece of crap.",1481414400,,831,4.483443708609271
