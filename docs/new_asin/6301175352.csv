8280691,5,6301175352,"Great video with lots of music and Michael, Robert, Oz and Tim explaining how they got started, how they found God, etc. It has interviews and shots of each guy's personal life.  I would also recommend ""Stryper - Live in Japan"" and the Stryper Expo videos/DVDs that have been released since they reunited in 2000.  All are very entertaining.",1193875200,3,341,4.762711864406779
