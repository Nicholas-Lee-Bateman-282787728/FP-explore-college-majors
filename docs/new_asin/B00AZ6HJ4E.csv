8559450,5,B00AZ6HJ4E,"Kevin Butler has produced an excellent series of 10 instructional DVDs for serious students of chess at all levels. All Things Chess was produced using the reknowned Deep Rybka 4 chess engine, and is narrated by Butler throughout. The annotations and commentary provided are insightful and amusing, and highlight not only strategy and tactics, but also provide historical facts of interest related to the game (E.g., When discussing the enfilade tactic, Butler refers to the military strategy developed as a result of the chess maneuver. RESULT: students get a concrete visual image of enfilade and are more likely to retain both the concept and its name).

Here are the contents of this series:

Disc 01--Chess Basics
Disc 02--Openings (1)
Disc 03--Openings (2)
Disc 04--Openings (3)
Disc 05--Middle Game (1)
Disc 06--Middle Game (2)
Disc 07--Traps (1)
Disc 08--Traps (2)
Disc 09--End Game
Disc 10--Famous Matches

Other series authored by more famous names in chess cost significantly more and many do not provide the depth or breadth of analysis that Butler provides in All Things Chess, truly a treasure trove of information for aspiring students of the game from beginner to advanced.

In case you are wondering, while I am not a rated chess player, my bridge student (I am a tournament bridge player currently ranked Bronze Life Master), who reviewed this series with me, has a current FIDE rating of 1877 and USCF rating of 1879, both achieved prior to attaining age 11 (current age: 16). He has chosen to adopt this series to use for teaching chess to students of all ages.",1380153600,3,1581,5.0
