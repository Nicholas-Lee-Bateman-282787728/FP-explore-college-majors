4046590,5,B0030U1TFW,"I'm so excited that this wierd and wonderful film is coming to DVD. This early Paramount film is filled with contract players from that lot including W. C. fields, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant. But what's interesting is the use of make-up which transforms them into the original illustrations of the classic book. The Walrus and the Carpenter cartoon in the film is an early Fleischer Bros. And the final scene is truly bizarre.",1261094400,3,423,4.808219178082192
4046591,3,B0030U1TFW,This movie features many classic film stars as each one provides a scene or two with Alice on her journey. Black & White no special features.,1504742400,,141,4.461538461538462

4046593,5,B0030U1TFW,"A great version of Alice and strangely a tad creepy in some scenes. The makeup on some of the characters just seemed a little twisted and unsettling. Like The Dutches, Tweedledee&Tweedledum and  Humpty Dumpty. However it all seems effective overall and Id say this is one of the top 5 versions to see.",1499904000,,301,4.679245283018868
4046594,4,B0030U1TFW,Interesting but you will not recognize any of the movie stars of that time period because of the costumes. The actress playing Alice is superb. Really just for collectors of Alice movies.,1497398400,,187,4.875
4046595,4,B0030U1TFW,"Paramount's ""All-Star"" adaptation of ""Alice In Wonderland"", featuring Cary Grant, W.C. Fields, Gary Cooper, Edna May Oliver, May Robson, Sterling Holloway, and dozens of other character actors and now forgotten stars, was a flop in 1933. But this is actually one of the best film versions of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice"" books. Disney's 1951 animated version is really a terribly misguided mash-up. This version, at least, puts the ""Alice"" books together in a way that makes ""movie"" sense""; and it does so in a breezy 77 minutes.
  This version actually begins with ""Through The Looking-Glass."" On a Winter afternoon, Alice (Charlotte Henry) falls asleep in an armchair. She steps through the Looking-Glass into a world where everything is backwards. After she flies out of the Looking-Glass House, she sees the White Rabbit and follows him down the Rabbit Hole into Wonderland. From there, most of the events from the books are included, except for Alice growing large in the White Rabbit's house, and the trial over the Queen Of Heart's tarts. In this version, Alice starts to run with the Gryphon, who suddenly turns into the Red Queen, (Edna May Oliver) who sets Alice off on her journey across a large chess board.
  The special effects are quite impressive, and the film successfully captures the weird, wild, wacky, and scary tone of Lewis Carroll's books. Charlotte Henry is excellent  and enthusiastic as Alice. This film version would, in fact, make an excellent Double Feature with MGM's 1939 fantasy classic ""The Wizard Of Oz.""",1492473600,2,1534,5.071428571428571

The reason we could never find it is because it is titled wrong, even on the movie itself.

4046653,4,B0030U1TFW,"This movie is for children and adults alike; very enjoyable and quite imaginative. At some stages it sounds like a soft horror movie. The movie shows the experiences a young girl lost in looking mirror and enters a strange world where she has actual conversation with various animals. The performance of Charlotte Henry as Alice is magnificent.

There are several versions of this movie and my favorite is the original 1933 film with leading actors (who have lent their voices) which include W.C. Fields, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Roscoe Ates, Edward Everett Horton and Louise Fazenda.

Many astrobiologists have speculated that our interactions with aliens could be even stranger than Alice's in the wonderland. This is a very imaginative movie and it is recommended.",1414540800,2,767,5.17741935483871

IMDB says that...""The film was previewed at 90 minutes and featured scenes with Julie Bishop as Alice's sister, Harvey Clark as Father William, and Lucien Littlefield as Father William's son. These scenes were deleted and the general release version runs 75 minutes.""

4046672,3,B0030U1TFW,"Well, here's another one to check off the list (you'll know what I mean if you read my Atlantis review).

I'm really not rating ""Alice in Wonderland (1933)"" as I would rate a film (it would probably get less than 1-star).  I'm rating it as a reaction to my getting to see it again, 50+ years after my first (and only) viewing.  A few scenes had really stuck in my mind, and I needed to purge...  Well, it's purged.  Unfortunately, none of my childish emotions were stirred...  I could have done without the re-viewing, but there was no way to know without seeing it.

4046679,5,B0030U1TFW,"To be honest, I knew I was already going to enjoy this because it's an Alice in Wonderland movie. Even the not-so-good made for TV versions have been enjoyable in their own way.

This one had a nice price and Cary Grant is in it, so I decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint, quite the opposite actually! For some reason, I had it in my head that Alice in Wonderland couldn't possibly be as good without it being in color, just because you'd think all those wacky characters and such couldn't be portrayed nearly as well in Black and White. But this was so good -- it had that distinct 1930's style --really witty, snappy dialogue, and the character acting is superb. I half-expected the special effects to be not so special at all, but those too were utterly enjoyable. The Alice in this is now my favorite Alice actress of all time, and this movie is easily in my top 3 of favorite Alice films.
By the end of it, I couldn't have cared less that it wasn't in color...it held my attention all the way through (which is saying something for me), and there were several scenes where I literally laughed out loud. It's just an absolutely delightful film.",1392768000,4,1159,4.390697674418605

This is a mash-up of both books by Joe Mankiewicz, and William Cameron Menzies, cast with all the stars at Paramount's disposal. The Wally Westmore make up is astoundingly true to the John Tenniel original illustrations, and I can remember seeing a short subject on television when I was a kid that showed how it was done. It would have been a perfect extra feature for this disc, as would a commentary track, but alas. Watching this film is like having a dream, pleasant at times, at others disturbing.  Fields as Humpty-Dumpty is a stand-out. A nice job by young Charlotte Henry as Alice. Watch for Sterling Holloway, Edna May Oliver, Jack Oakie, Edward Everett Horton, Polly Moran, and many, many others. An old movie buff's dream! And really, no extras?

4046709,4,B0030U1TFW,"Movies of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass has been made so many times its unreal. Even when you look it up you get different numbers, in every language you can imagine, and altered to fit a dozen different cultures.  there was supposedly even a television short in 1937(tv? 1937?), though Ive never seen that one. as well as a softcore version which I'll leave to your imagination. let's just say that Alice is 21 years old in that one.
If you are one of these people who find ""children's"" stories that actually have more meaning for adults creepy then why are you reading this.

This version like most Alice movies, can be enjoyed by whole families as they achieve the rarity of being relevant to different ages for different reasons.
Most so with regards to this version. It has a much more heavy weight cast than most.  Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, W.C.Fields; in 1933 you could not have a bigger casting call.  Its a nice version. Like most its not terribly interested in the actual story, instead creating the general character to match the big name in its skin.

Its not the best version artistically or in accuracy but its something everyone can sit down together and watch without anyones objection. And there seems to be a certain appeal of those actors I specifically named above that even younger people who have no idea who the actors are still seem drawn to them.

I own about 20 different versions of Alice films and several different written volumes and treatises. I have loved these particular stories since I was very young. the of the images you create in your mind reading them are better than any movie, even CGI cant compare. the hidden puzzles and themes that catch you suddenly when you're doing something else and that thing you're doing makes something odd in the story make sense ow. No, I don't think Im obsessed.
they were some of the first stories read to me and one of the first books I mastered on my own.
 personally I can not stand the Disney version and my favorite version is in black and white, Victorian period, and none of the actors are dressed as animals.

For something easy on the adults that may keep kids interested on Holidays where everyone is stuck together This is a good choice.

although I do know quite a number of people under 30 who refuse to watch black and white movies because anything before they were born isn't relative to them. These people I do not call friends, but I do know them.
I think of them you might if you found a neanderthal in your backyard eating your petunias. You want to be friendly because you're not certain how they may react but you don't want to be seen talking with them at any of the better parties.",1379116800,2,2697,4.532921810699588

When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

REVIEW OF THIS 1933 FILM...
This is the oldest Alice in Wonderland that I've found on Amazon. There are several aspects to this fun and funny version of the Alice story that make it worth seeing. First, the costuming and sets in this film are marvelous. A significant effort was made to have the characters appear like John Tenniel's illustrations. The sets have a cartoonish 2-D look to them, which matches perfectly with the animated footage integrated into the live action. Overall the special effects are stunning for that era.

You see some pretty famous people in this movie. Well you don't really ""see"" them, because most everyone's in costume. One of the most famous Hollywood leading men of the 40's and 50's, Cary Grant, plays the Mock Turtle. We catch him here in only the second year of his film career. Then we have actor, funny man, and celebrity of his time, W.C Fields playing Humpty Dumpty. For a man who professed intense dislike for children (assumedly as part of his ""act"") it's interesting to see him turn up in this film. It's a perfect fit because Field's sardonic wit and temperament match the attitude of Lewis Carroll's slightly grumpy Humpty Dumpty to a tee. If there's an Alice in Wonderland play going on in heaven, Fields is Humpty Dumpty.

Another famous actor, Gary Cooper (from the great western 'High Noon') turns in a touching performance as the White Knight. Two actors whose voices may be more recognizable than their names show up; Edward Everett Horton plays the Mad Hatter (Horton was the voice of the Narrator for Fractured Fairy Tales in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon). And Sterling Holloway plays the frog-footman (he voiced Winnie the Pooh and dozens of Disney characters). Holloway would go on to play the Cheshire Cat in the Disney version of AIW nearly 20 years later.

Alice is played by 19 year old Charlotte Henry, who IMDB reports was selected out of 7,000 applicants! She reacts pretty well to her fantastic environment, but she is not the leading attraction in this film. Well then, who or what *is* the leading attraction in this film, you ask? Along with the kudos already passed out, you really have to check out the Tweedledee and Tweedledum bit. Their makeup is really creepy, and the actors just have a field day with the parts. An uninhibited performance from them, and a hilarious cartoon animation of the Walrus and the Carpenter story are stand-out attractions in this movie.

This film is an amalgam of both 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There'. They enacted most of the passages from the first book, with the usual skipping of the serpent and egg segment, and the encounter with the puppy after leaving the rabbit's house. In this case they actually skip the rabbit's house altogether, and, surprisingly, the tart trial at the end of the first book. Instead they cut to the Looking Glass segments, and render quite a large portion of the sequel; the Tweedledee and Tweedledum segment, a meeting with the Red Queen, the encounter with Humpty-Dumpty, then the White Knight, and finally Alice crosses the 8th row of the chess board to be crowned Queen. The movie ends on the dinner party in the castle. So yes, they ""Hollywoodized"" the ending, but it's so much fun getting there you don't really care!

The movie also has a Wizard of Oz lilt to it in that the opening of the picture introduces a couple of real life characters who later appear in the film as Alice in Wonderland characters.

------------
To close, let me please mention the Alice in Wonderland films produced prior to 1933, but not available on Amazon. They're worth a look. The very first Alice movie ever made was a B&W silent film in 1903! It starred a 14 year old May Clark. At the time of its making in Britain it was the longest movie made to date at 12 minutes (8 of which survive). What's left of the film has been restored though. You can find this movie on YouTube, but this first Alice movie is also included on the DVD of the 1966 rendition of Alice in Wonderland starring Anne-Marie Mallik and Peter Sellers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B002VXEC26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). The 1903 featurette on the DVD has a very worthwhile commentary track, and since the `66 Alice production is an absolute treasure, especially if you are up for a rather dark and creepy version of the Alice story, it's a good way to go.

A 1910 version starring 14 year old Gladys Hulette made by Thomas Edison's production company, but a print does not seem to be available. What a loss. Next is a 1915 version of the Alice story that starred Viola Savoy at age 16. This is a highly regarded film, and is actually one of the most honest in terms of following the book. They definitely added a few extras, but much of the dialog was used verbatim and the animals were made up to resemble John Tenniel's illustrations. And in spite of being a silent movie, they took on the reading of the Father William poem. They displayed the text of the poem on the screen, cutting to footage of two actors acting out the poem! You can find this one on YouTube.

Finally, there is a rare 1931 production of Alice in Wonderland that as far as I know can only be found on EBay. It's noteworthy in that it is the first talkie production of the Alice story. The movie is not in great shape but is certainly worthy of a view. Alice is played by Ruth Gilbert (age 19) who really animates the character with a sort of tongue-n-cheek performance. The production is almost like adults putting on a high school play. Everyone looks like they're having piles of fun though. It's like they're all is trying to be serious but are about to break out in laughter at any moment. Checkout the costumes on the King and Queen of hearts; they almost look like real playing cards. (btw- A Wiki article on this movie notes that 1931 would have been Lewis Carroll's 100th birthday, and that Alice Liddell herself visited America to take part in the Alice fever sweeping both America and Britain at the time.)

At least at $1.99, which is what I paid for it at GoHastings, it wasn't overpriced! Extremely disappointing, since I'd always heard this was a forgotten classic. It SHOULD be forgotten!

The ancient SpFX are cool, the blend of film/animated bits tolerable, the masks and costumes quite remarkable, and the sets like 3D versions of the stuff in the background of the more druggy Betty Boop cartoons.
But the film zips along far too quickly, the script is a illogical mishmash of fragments of the original text, and what really put the chap on my ass was how the film STUPIDLY combines both of Carroll's Alice books into a surrealistic hash.
Still, as an oddity from the past, I'm glad I've experienced it.",1326585600,,767,4.565217391304348
4046734,3,B0030U1TFW,"There had been three silent film versions of Charles Dodgson's(pseudonym Lewis Carroll)classic 1865 book Alice In Wonderland and just one sound version before this 1933 version made by Paramount studios. Like many films bought by distributors during the late 40s and into the 50s and pared down to fit neatly into TV time slots,this film went from around 90 minutes to 76 and change in this current version. Laurel and Hardy's /34 Babes in Toyland is a prime example;not only was its 90 minutes also cut down to around 78 min's but it's name was also changed. On top of that it was probably this version of Alice which caught Stan Laurel's eye in 1933 when he cast Charlotte Henry who played Alice here,as his Bo-Peep in Babes in Toyland. Because of the release of the Johnny Depp version of Alice in /10,Universal got the rights to release this onto DVD;its' debut in that format. But in its cut format it is a disappointment indeed.
The story about a girl who imagines an opposite world in her houses' mirror and enters into that topsy turvy world through it,is well known and won't be discussed in any detail here. Paramount's version is a ponderous one as Alice goes from situation to situation meeting all sorts of odd and comical creatures. Paramount trotted out their big stable of stars to play in this production and it featured some of those who were on the decline from the silent days to those newer and soon to be stars. These include:Richard Arlen as the Cheshire Cat,William Austin as the Gryphon,two new and up and comers Gary Cooper as the White Knight and Cary Grant as the Mock Turtle,Leon Errol as Uncle Gilbert,two stars the cartoons of the era satirized many times over,St Thomas,Ontario's own Ned Sparks as the Caterpillar and Louise Fazenda as the White Queen,Charles Ruggles as the March Hare,Edward Everett Horton as the Mad Hatter,Mae Marsh as the Sheep,Ford Sterling as the White King and the legendary WC Fields as Humpty Dumpty. There is a brief and uncredited role as a baby by Billy Barty. Also the animation used comes from Paramount's fave Fleischer Studios.
The special effects for 1933 are quite remarkable and still stand up quite well today. The print used here is also quite good and clear. There are no extras at all.
If not for the facts of 1)its' truncated form being released onto DVD(of this I am NOT surprised)and 2)it's slow moving and ponderous plot(actually more like a myriad of joined together skits),this movie may have earned a better rating.

The Humpty Dumpty sequence seems like it was written for W.C. Fields. And who would expect to see Cary Grant weeping his eyes out in a giant turtle suit or Gary Cooper dim wittingly falling off a horse? You will not find this film cloying or even endearing.

4046737,4,B0030U1TFW,"Curioser and curioser...  Universal finally released the long sought-after 1933 Paramount production of ALICE IN WONDERLAND earlier this year, in an obvious attempt to take advantage of renewed ""Wonderland Mania"", created by the Disney/Tim Burton remake.  This early Talkie version mashes together ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"", and does so quite successfully, I might add, with a surprisingly literate screeenplay that retains much of Lewis Carroll's original dialogue.

Crafted by Paramount as a vehicle for many of it's top stars (the main title sequence runs for over two minutes, outlining the gallery of stars and who they play), this ALICE IN WONDERLAND has always been a charming oddity.  One can never tell, especially with the lumpy, rubbery masks and full-length costumes used for some of the characters, whether the actual billed actors are inside or whether they only provided the dialogue.  The costumes were clearly designed to follow in the style of the books' original Tenniel illustrations and do come off rather well (especially the chess pieces and the Gryphon); Cary Grant is the Mock-Turtle, with Gary Cooper playing the White Knight and W.C. Fields inside the Humpty Dumpty egg (the egg's mouth is lined with what appear to be shark's teeth - yet another spooky element).

Alice herself is played by the charming Charlotte Henry; and with her loose, free-flowing hair and pinafore, looks exactly like the Alice from the books.  She anchors the character very nicely.  Other fine performances come from Edna May Oliver as the Red Queen and Louise Fazenda as the White Queen.

The screenplay--quite cleverly, I'll admit--actually swaps the two stories around, with Alice first entering the Looking-Glass House and then falling down the rabbit hole.  Special effects are quite exceptional for the period as well, especially the flying tricks and the back-projection for Alice's plunge down the rabbit hole (did Walt Disney use this movie as inspiration for his animated version?).

No extras are included.  There is supposedly a longer version of the movie (which includes more of a back-story for Alice herself) but one gets the feeling that Universal rushed this title out purely to take advantage of the latest Tim Burton version.  A fine addition if you're an ""Alice"" fan.",1291420800,3,2333,5.239247311827957
4046738,3,B0030U1TFW,"We all know the story of Alice in Wonderland. The many renderings of it prove that it is a classic, and each seems to have distinct variations. This film combines the original story with Through the Looking Glass, so many of the characters that appear here seldom show up in other versions.

This is a rather odd film. It doesn't seem to have much of a story. Instead, Alice wanders around and meets characters that we are all pretty familiar with by now, but she doesn't seem to have a purpose and none of the characters have anything to unite them except for the fact that they're in Wonderland. Therefore, this is a curiosity.

That is not to say that the film is not entertaining. For classic film fans, it is great fun to see great screen lovers like Cary Grant and Gary Cooper dressed up like a turtle and a clumsy, elderly knight respectively. The costuming has a very distinct style, and it is downright disturbing, especially the wide, clay-mouths that most of the characters share.

There are not special features on this disk, which is quite a shame, and the film only runs 77 minutes instead of the original 90, but it is a must-see for fans of Alice in Wonderland. Lets hope for a better edition in the future, though.",1286841600,4,1231,4.511210762331839
4046739,4,B0030U1TFW,"While I'm no fan of Universal Studios Home Entertainment and the indifferent way USHE generally treats its older releases, in this case I have to say they've gotten a bum rap and something needs to be said.

Other customer reviews note a rumored 90 minute version of ALICE and berate USHE for only releasing the supposedly shortened version of the film on DVD. I'm here to tell you that the myth of the 90 minute version is just that--a myth.

I've had occasion to look into the making of this movie twice. Once, fleetingly, for my 2003 biography of W.C. Fields, and more deeply for a book I'm currently preparing on William Cameron Menzies. I've read the MPPDA file on the film, seen many of the reviews, noted contemporary articles on its making, and examined various drafts of Menzies' illustrated screenplay. At no time was the film any longer than 76 minutes. The Variety review, published December 26, 1933, gives its length as 76 minutes, and the 1935-36 Motion Picture Almanac (the earliest I have at hand) gives it as 75 minutes. (Close enough.) There are no major scenes in the shooting script, dated September, 1933, that are not in the film, and the Hays Office file shows that no eliminations were required at any time. In fact, Dr. James Wingate, in approving the film on December 9, 1933, commended the studio on an excellent job. ""We trust that, in addition to the satisfaction of having produced one of the most notable pictures of the year, Paramount will also find that the picture will measure up at the box office to its outstanding production quality.""

In terms of the DVD itself, the picture quality seems just fine to me. No attempt has been made to restore the film in any way, and there are zero extras, but the source materials seem to have been in fine shape, and the transfer appears to confim this. And whatever you may think of the film itself, it is, for 1933, a fascinating example of state-of-the-art visual effects, produced the same year as that other groundbreaking show, KING KONG. In conception, it may have been a mistake to combine both ALICE books into one scenaio, but if you've never seen this film, forget everything else you've heard about it and just allow it to take you in.

The show is in full black & white, and the many stars are usually covered or hide behind costumes and extreme masks.  Ive heard that this is sometimes difficult to recognize the stars wearing such large costumes, but its really no different from voicing an animated feature where the characters do not resemble the voice actor in any form.
All in all, this is a good movie and we can thank the actress who plays the title role of Alice for being a believable one from the Storybook. There really are some great scenes while trying to cover all the basics, like the final scene with Alice becoming a queen herself and caught in chaotic dinner scene with plates of food that come alive.

I remembered it being weird but kind of fascinating,although I had no appreciation for the fact that there were famous movie stars under all those bizarre costumes and heavy makeup. After seeing the new version...which is a riff on the original rather than a ""remake""...I became interested in seeing it again. I'm glad I saw it but I didn't love it. It seems to be pretty close in spirit to Lewis Carroll, and the visuals were clearly inspired by the original illustrations, but the entire enterprise seemed rather clumsy and dramatically inert to me. Nontheless, ALICE enthusiasts will want to see this one and compare it to other versions.

The Alice is actually very good if by necessity older than ideal.

I believe Cocteau drew on this or the other way around or both ways. ""Belle et Bete"" has some of this feel, very very similar. I do wish the UCLA 90 min. print were used, whatever the excuse.

A lot of it seems like vaudeville -- Alice runs into a character and becomes the straight man (girl) for a not-very-funny routine.  The visual effects are not even good for their time, in that the original King Kong came out the very same year.

4046753,5,B0030U1TFW,"What can I say. Charlotte Henry is a wonderful Alice in a wonderful movie about a wonderful place.
  I pretty much love all the 'Alice' movies and musical plays. They are all so whimsical and so funny and charming. I love Disney,Bunin, the stuffy English versions, the music hall version,the Burton,Svankmajaer,Willing versions. Heck, I even love the Steve Allen version. But I'll have to say I have a real soft spot in my heart for this beautiful B&W 30's version. It's just so incredibly fun and satisfying that you want to just live it again and again. Not to mention I want Charlotte Henry for a best friend or a little sister. She's so cute.
I didn't start out loving this movie. When I was younger I always thought it was really weird. I even thought it was sort of scary, especially Humpty Dumpty ( I even had nightmares about this movie), that just shows you how silly and naive we are when we are young. I just saw this movie again for the first time and I fell(like Alice down the hole) head over heel in love with it. The film is a marvel of everything, and as I said, Charlotte Henry is soooo perfect.
B&W films have a surrealist magic that color films don't have. I still think the film is really weird, but now I mean that in a good way.
 I am so sorry to hear that Universal didn't release the best print of this film that was available. People these days are so thoughtless about the classics. They think everything is about the new. Naah. New movies and music and stuff sucks. Give me the old time stuff any day. Don't let a bad copy stop you from buying this. It still looks great and is better than half of the putrid phony CGI B.S. that is pushed out there today.

4046755,3,B0030U1TFW,"Long known in some of the worst dubs I've ever seen, the 1933 Paramount all star cast production of ""Alice in Wonderland"" has now been issued on an 'official' DVD. Well, what we have here, though slightly better than the best video dub I've seen, remains disappointing. I suspect the quality is far inferior to the original nitrate copy currently residing in the UCLA Film Archive vaults. Given the brilliant DVD issues we have seen of many Paramount films from around this period - notably Lubitsch's ""Trouble in Paradise"" - it's a great shame this 1933 Alice must continue to linger in the shadows, its eccentric joys and charming creations suppressed under cloudly indistinct images.

Some of the other reviewers here seem to be laboring under the impression that UCLA does not offer any of their holdings for use in DVDs. That's not quite correct. A brilliant copy of some Columbia films - too often spoiled by dreadful prints - have hit the marketplace - a UCLA archive copy of ""His Girl Friday"" was offered, and earlier on Laserdisc another UCLA Archives print was used for ""My Sister Eileen"".

To finally answer the problem of the film's length: UCLA holds the entire Paramount studio collection of earlier films, starting with before the coming of sound. The archives' 16mm safety dub of 2 reels (3200 ft.) of Alice in Wonderland, certainly taken from their original studio print, times out at 76 minutes. There may indeed be a longer unedited version, but UCLA does not appear to possess it. It's also interesting that the safety print condition notes 'Scratches."" Another 1 reel safety print, also in 16mm, exists as well.

The original studio copy the archives owns is 4 reels on 35 mm nitrate print, estimated at 8000 ft. Anyone wishing to further pursue this can check with the UCLA Film Archives and use the number assigned to the studio print, M3873.",1267833600,16,1865,4.821875

Every character looks exactly as they were originally drawn. This movie also stands out because it is both ALICE IN WONDERLAND & THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS mixed together without any conflicts to the screenplay. I can't believe that this movie was not shown more often and brought to DVD alot sooner. It's got the same quality and appeal that THE WIZARD OF OZ has, with the exception that it's in black & white. For anyone who is an ALICE fan or to those who like a fun family movie from early Hollywood check this one out, you won't be disappointed.",1267833600,10,825,4.398692810457517
4046757,4,B0030U1TFW,"I first encountered this version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND back in the early 1960s when I was home from school recovering from a bad cold. In those days your local TV station would show morning movies before the game shows started. I only saw it that one time until many years later but I never forgot some of the imagery. It may not be Lewis Carroll's ALICE (no movie ever is) but it does create a world of its own which is its strongest selling point. It actually plays better today than in 1933 for with few exceptions (W.C. Fields, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper), no one remembers the other stars (aside from Charlotte Henry best known as Bo-Peep in Laurel & Hardy's BABES IN TOYLAND) and so they can be viewed as characters not stars under heavy make-up. The adaptation by Joseph L. Mankiewicz retains most of Carroll's original dialogue and is more THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS than ALICE. It flows very nicely between the two books and at 77 minutes seems just right. As has been noted elsewhere the film was originally 90 minutes but the missing footage deals with the real world so it probably isn't missed too badly. The question is why was it cut.

For reasons that have never been fully explained or understood, the film has been out of circulation for years (even from TV showings) and was never officially released until now to cash in on the Tim Burton adaptation (just as Sherlock Holmes movies have reappeared in time for Robert Downey Jr's version). That's how the game is played. The cover has even been colorized to hide the fact from most people that the film is in black & white. The production design by the legendary William Cameron Menzies uses black and white to good advantage as does Bert Glennon's photography so fortunately no attempt was made to colorize the film for this release. In fact Universal, who now owns the rights to the film, has made no attempt to do much of anything with this release which is a real shame. I'm sure there are copyright issues involved but it would have been nice to have the Betty Boop cartoon BETTY IN BLUNDERLAND as an added bonus as well as production stills or commentary from someone who admires the film. Although not a perfect transfer, it is light years away from the bootleg and gray market copies available until now and for that I am thankful. Maybe someday it will get the royal treatment it deserves.",1267833600,16,2364,4.5754716981132075
4046758,4,B0030U1TFW,"I have vague memories (I think) of seeing this on TV as a kid.  It's something of a holy grail to nostalgia buffs of course given that nearly every Paramount star who was anybody in 1933 - including most famously Cary Grant, W.C. Fields and Gary Cooper - appears in it, and it's never been on video before.  Its reputation isn't all that great though, and the film was shorn of about 15 minutes on reissues which apparently (see below) have been lost for good.  So it was with a bit of trepidation that I, inveterate Alice-lover, took a gander.

I needn't have worried.  Sure, this suffers from all of the defects one would expect of such a lavish star-vehicle from the day - too much rushing through scenes (even at its original 90 minutes, trying to shunt together big hunks of both ""Alice"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" is going to feel thin), an Alice (Charlotte Henry) who is both too old and just not expressive enough for the part, a director (Norman Z. McLeod) sometimes content to point-and-shoot, and some celeb bits (Cary Grant as the Mock Turtle in particular) that just aren't that great or are too short.  And this is one of those rare black and white films where I actually thought more than once while watching ""gee, I wish this had been in color"".  Somehow ""Alice"" more than almost any classic story, seems to demand a riotous palette of hues.

BUT the sets and art direction - supervised by an uncredited William Cameron Menzies, one of the greatest art directors/production designers of all time but listed here only as co-screenwriter - is truly wonderful, capturing at times the surrealism and madness of the tale with an expressionist's palate of odd shapes and complex backgrounds.  Some of the special effects are really excellent as well and seem pretty advanced for the year - the raven flying over Tweedledee and Tweedledum for example, and the flying effects for Alice.  And though as I said, the conflation of the two books makes for a dash-through-it-quick-as-you-can feeling to things, the way in which McLeod, Menzies and the rest of the team actually constructed the film is pretty ingenious: it starts with Alice going into Looking-Glass world, rescuing the chess pieces from the fire, then running out of the house and following the rabbit at which point it follows mostly the events of ""Wonderland"" for 45 minutes or so, only to go back into ""Looking Glass"" territory smoothly towards the finish.

But the primary joy is in the cast; as mentioned I have some issues, but on the whole I really enjoyed most of the stars, and it seems like many of the more important ones did get into the swing of things.  Edna Mae Oliver is delightfully goofy and sly as the Red Queen, Fields is perfect as Humpty-Dumpty, Edward Everett Horton silly but tending towards dangerous as the Mad Hatter, and most of the rest of the names including Sterling Holloway and Jack Oakie seem to be enjoying themselves.  Top honors in the end have to go to Gary Cooper as the White Knight - frail, naive, joking, crazy, bumbling, and entirely sympathetic.  He dominates the screen and comes the closest I think to being a ""real"" person - though in the end he's not around long enough to be any more than another crazy dream.

SUMMARY: though this is easily the best ""faithful"" Alice adaptation I've seen - not that most are that good, mind you - I can't quite give it the top rating, despite the excitement that I felt for it and my general pleasure at the film itself, and that is due almost entirely to the way Universal has handled this release.  Though the film doesn't look and sound bad, it isn't in terrific shape either - there are occasional tear lines in the frame and more dirt and speckling than there ought to be, if the film were given much restoration effort.  The DVD is completely bare-bones, no extras whatsoever - not even a trailer - and given that it is in fact the shorter reissue, it would be nice to at least be given some information as to why we're getting the shorter version, and what may have happened to the missing footage.  I can well understand the anger of some of the reviewers at the cheap way this was put out, timed for the release of the new Tim Burton film and seemingly marketed to capitalize on that - but not to really cater to the collectors who have long waited for it.

Still, a mediocre release of a formerly missing classic is better than nothing, and I think there are enough positives to be accentuated for me to recommend this.  Perhaps the best thing to do would be to email Universal with any dissatisfaction you might feel as to the quality of the product.  While this ""Alice"" may not be a masterpiece, it certainly deserved better treatment than this, after 77 years.",1267747200,118,4731,4.595011876484561

transfer quality and sound are both 'okay.' not great, not poor - just okay.

single disc, extremely bare bones packaging. NO special features whatsoever.  yet another missed opportunity in the mishandling of a classic film.

4046760,3,B0030U1TFW,"The 1933 Alice in Wonderland is a weird example of early sound cinema and one of the first attempts to capture fantasy.  Unfortunately, the film was received so badly by audiences that it killed the genre until Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 and The Wizard of Oz in 1939 revitalized it until WWII killed it again.  Lewis Carroll's satirical story of Victorian manners has never been definitely captured on film, mostly, I think, due to its highly symbolic imagery and chaotic spirit.  Some stories, like Twain's Huck Finn, and Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby, just work better on paper.  I think the other problem with Alice is that the story and characters are too aloof to get the audience involved.  Unlike the Wizard of Oz, there is practically no emotional center to the story.  We know very little of Alice and the episodic and nonsensical nature of the story just reinforces its superficiality, which is death nell for effective film fantasy.  Disney was able to solve this problem with another episodic and rather cold story, Mary Poppins, by seriously reworking it to make it the joyous moving fantasy movie classic it turned out to be.  The other problem with Alice is the horrendous decision to cover the stars faces with masks, whereby obliterating the stars' personas.  MGM learned from this error in judgement and made sure the human characters could be seen through the make-up in the WIzard of Oz.",1267574400,5,1425,4.855371900826446

These and more are featured in ALICE IN WONDERLAND, the trippiest film made in the early sound era. Technical wizardry abounds, as stop action, split-screen, double exposure, undercranking, superimposition and overlay film techniques bring Lewis Carroll's remarkable world on the looking glass's other side to life. Standard animation (provided by FLEISCHER Studios) is also used in the ""Walrus & Carpenter"" segment.

Highlights include a speedy lawn croquet game, Polly Moran as a historical date-spouting Dodo bird, 'Queen Alice' at the head of a tea party populated by delightful characters such as Edward Everett Horton's Mad Hatter, and especially the most imaginative sets this side of Wonderland itself! It's a movie that will always be the ultimate cinematic version of Alice and friends. Highest recommendation to all!

The members of the W.C. Fields Fan Club have been writing to Universal Studios for many years urging them to release all of the films of W.C. Fields on VHS and DVD.  Our efforts have paid off by The W.C. Fields Comedy Collection (Volume 1) and Volume Two and now with Alice in Wonderland.  W.C. Fields and film collectors have, for many years, screening this film on 16mm film and poor quality transfers to VHS and DVDs.

Althought W.C. Fields' role in Alice in Wonderland is brief, it is steller, as are many of the other stars' performances.

Regarding the quality of this DVD release, I expect high quality from this release of Alice, as Universal has announced that the DVD has been ""remastered"".  Also, the transfers of the W.C. Fields Comedy Collections were found to be of high quality and I feel no reason to expect less from Alice in Wonderland.

Thank you to Universal Studios for this release! Now, Universal, please release on DVD the following W.C. Fields films; If I Had A Million, Tillie and Gus, Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, and Mississippi.

4046765,5,B0030U1TFW,"Lewis Carroll's classic tale of fantastic creatures and clever wordplay, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, has long inspired film makers of every kind.  From the psychedelic colors of the Disney version to the latest and darker Tim Burton version, filmgoers have been enthralled with the story of a young girl, Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole and becomes immersed in a series of wild adventures with the likes of such strange characters as the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the White Rabbit, as well as the mysterious Cheshire Cat.  But for many long time film fans, one of the most beloved versions finally appears for the home viewer after being ignored through the VHS era.  Before now, this classic 1933 version could only be seen rarely on TV and more recently on You Tube.

Based on both Carroll's ALICE IN WONDERLAND and its sequel THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, and inspired by the original John Tenniel drawings, the Paramount pictures production presents this story with vivid costumes and make-up that was amazing for its time.  Many famous actors and actresses of the 30's appeared in many memorable roles, usually being unrecognizable in their costumes.  Some memorable cameos include a young Cary Grant as the Mock Turtle, Gary Cooper as the White Knight, Edward Everett Horton as the Mad Hatter, and the legendary W.C. Fields as Humpty Dumpty.  Charlotte Henry is a charmer as the inquisitive Alice.

8386060,4,B0030U1TFW,"I've never seen a fully satisfactory film version of Alice in Wonderland or Alice though the Looking Glass, and I've seen every sound version available, including non-English language versions. This sometimes creaky and stilted 1932 Paramount film remains the best of the bunch in my opinion. Unsurpassed cast, allowing for some miscasting, among which was Leon Errol wasted as Uncle Silbert instead of playing Mad Hatter or White Rabbit; and Richard Arlen unsuited to any Lewis Carroll character.",1520640000,,497,5.384615384615385
8386061,5,B0030U1TFW,"Although this was not a hit at the time, it has become a classic and probably the best adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic story. It's surreal and funny and bizarre. It's all the things that Carroll would have loved.",1520467200,,218,4.615384615384615
