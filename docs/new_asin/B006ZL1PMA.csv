5040122,4,B006ZL1PMA,"I bought the 8 Movies: Midnight Horror: Terror & Torment at my local Walmart for $5.00, which isn't bad for five movies.

The eight movies are:

The Prophecy
The Gingerdead Man
Scarecrow
Howling IV: The Original Nightmare
Hindsight
Disturbed
Cruel World
Inside

I already owned the DVDS of The Prophecy and the Scarecrow. I only bought this for the Howling IV (which I recall seeing as a kid) and The Gingerdead Man (I have heard of it, but I have never seen it.) I have never heard of the other four movies on this 2 disc set.

Besides from The Prophecy, the movies are low-budget horror flicks. The majority of them are slight below average, but a few are fun to watch.",1345248000,12,671,4.475409836065574

5040132,4,B006ZL1PMA,"I buy these multi-film DVDs for two reasons: one being, I love horror (especially bad horror) and two, there is always a diamond in the rough. In this collection, I was surprised to find that most of these are pretty good films.

Scarecrow and Gingerdead Man are purposely campy, but surprisingly well-made. I actually really enjoyed some of the music on Scarecrow! Plus, Tiffany Shepis? Mmm, mmm.

You can't really go wrong with any The Howling or Prophecy, but it seems like The Howling IV is on every single multi-movie horror pack I come across. I'd really like to see the other ones!

Cruel World is an excellent tongue-in-cheek film about Survivor-type reality shows, but the story loses steam about halfway through--there is plenty of creative gore to keep you entertained, though.

My favorites would have to be Hindsight and Inside. Hindsight has some bigger-name actors and has a nice twisted little plot. Inside is good enough that I would advise someone to buy this collection JUST to have this film. It is a work of demented genius with no sex, no gore, and minimal violence, yet still manages to make the hairs on your arms stand up.

And Disturbed? Don't even bother watching it. It's some homemade film with an incomprehensible plot, a tasteless (needless) rape scene, and the silliest ending I've seen in a long time. You're better off just laughing mindlessly at Gingerdead Man.",1396224000,18,1396,4.8734177215189876
5040133,1,B006ZL1PMA,out of 8 movies there was only one that was worth watching the other 7 was even worse than the old b movies if i could i would resell them but i would never get my money back for this one or the 10 zombie movies i had periviously bought after trying both of these i will not order any more nor recomend them to any one,1386460800,5,318,3.7611940298507465
5040134,1,B006ZL1PMA,"This has to be one of the worst conglomerations of 'horror' movies I've seen yet. And I'm a huge fan of the Midnight Horror Collections. But Horror? More like comedy. The only good movie on the entire set is Frozen in Fear and that's more of a murder-mystery than a horror flick. When I see ""Horror"" written on the outside of a DVD set, well, that's what I expect. With this one? It's completely laughable. Stupid movies, poor acting and not the slightest bit scary. Either the peeps who threw this set together were scrambling desperately for material or playing a serious joke on the horror-loving public.

Bigtime thumbs-down compared to the other collections. At least on the other ones I can find 2 or 3 decent movies out of the bunch, but this one is so bad I'm tossing it into the trash so it's not taking up room on my DVD shelf.",1382313600,2,837,4.435064935064935

5040139,5,B006ZL1PMA,"This compilation of movies are the typical modern style horror flicks with very little story or significance and a great deal of mind numbing violence, however some can be interesting. The delivery of the package was very fast and ahead of the indicated time. Packaging of the item was neat and secure. I purchased this movie used and it was better than described. The condition on receipt could have been taken for new. I have purchased many items from this seller and continue to buy from them because I have never been disappointed. This seller is highly recommended, thank you.",1360022400,,581,4.82
5040140,3,B006ZL1PMA,"Although the title is 8-film Midnight Horror, the compilation was more of a thriller/suspense genre. The movies were not bad movies, they were just not what I expected.",1359590400,7,168,5.035714285714286
5040141,3,B006ZL1PMA,I really enjoyed the first disc but the other disc not so much. However; for the price it was still a good buy. I'm not saying someone out there wouldn't enjoy the ones I didn't like. I'll give the disliked disc to a friend so it all works out in the end!,1358467200,5,255,3.923076923076923

So, I wasn't expecting the best of movies...perhaps cult classics types or B movies. I am a fan of horror movies. This collection is absolutely a assault on my eyes. I didn't like one single movie and besides that they weren't even horror...they were all more like Thrillers. Several of movies were of bad quality and more like pornography than horror flicks.",1502841600,,453,4.746835443037975
