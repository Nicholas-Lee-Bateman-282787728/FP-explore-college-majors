1455901,5,B00005JLF3,"This review refers to the Region 2 (PAL) versions of the DVD. The UK market gets a headstart in seeing the release of Season 1 of The West Wing in 2 DVD box sets (Set 1-Episodes 1-11 & Set 2-Episodes 12-22). The show itself is fast paced and brimming with intelligent dialogue. Once you put it in your DVD player, you wouldn't want to stop until you get to the end of it. Special features for Set 1 include TV spot & short interviews with major cast members and Aaron Sorkin, the creator of the show & DVD-ROM enhanced features. Set 2 extras include several TV spots and 'Making of' featurette for all TWW fans & DVD-ROM features. Extremely satisfying TV viewing. Can't wait for the new seasons to come out on DVD.",1030838400,40,714,4.37593984962406
1455902,5,B00005JLF3,"I'm generally so turned-off by US television that I don't even own a TV. However, this series is something different. The dialogue is sharp, witty and illuminating. The characters never cease to show off their capacity to come up with stunning lines off-the-cuff.

1455903,5,B00005JLF3,"This DVD has the first eleven episodes with a bonus of interviews with the writer Sorkin and most of the cast.
West Wing is one of the better ensemble dramas ever screened on television. However it was only after seeing the interviews of Sorkin and the cast members that one realised how it was done. Sorkin is clearly highly intelligent and his scripts are powerful and the basis of the show. This becomes clear when you hear the cast members talk. They lack the presence of their on screen personalities and although they are talented actors one realises that it is the structure of the plot and their lines which creates the characters.
Sorkin also indicates how in reality the plots have a high level of sentimental resolutions. One doesn?t pick this up in watching it. Sorkin explains how he uses humour to break up the flow of the story and to prevent the material becoming mawkish. He also indicates that although the White House portrayed is a Democrat one, he interplays conservative and liberal story lines. On first viewing the show it appeared to be moderately liberal but on re-watching the episodes on the CD Sorkin is right. The second episode is highly nationalistic and the last scene is the character played by Martin Sheen regretting that Americans cannot walk the earth with the same protection that was afforded the ancient romans. In other episodes the character Donna argues strongly the Republican line on taxation.
Watching these eleven episodes after watching them on TV some years ago, one is still struck by the strength of the characters, the frantic pace of the action and the fact that the scenes are seldom static. Even though one begins to see that there is a sentimentality which initially slips by you, one can still be moved when Toby arranges the funeral and honour guard for the homeless war veteran. It is however the humour and intelligence which is the driving force of the series and what makes it so watchable.",1030320000,107,1953,4.781065088757397
1455904,5,B00005JLF3,"Finally, West Wing fans in US can stop envying their European friends! This is one purchase no one will regret.",1029888000,2,111,4.6
1455905,5,B00005JLF3,I watched the first part of season one and then went on a frantic search for part two.  Finally got it this month and boy was it worth the wait...  I can only agree with everyone so far in that this is got to be the best series in years and certainly the best thing being shown on British TV.  The producers couldn't have picked a better cast.  Them and the story lines are what makes this series CRACKIN (Scottish for fantastic)...,1027900800,3,432,4.2317073170731705
1455906,5,B00005JLF3,"The West Wing is about the best thing on UK TV. It is great drama, with excellent characters, absorbing story lines and a sense of humour. If only real politics were the same. There are few other things that make me look forward to Sunday evenings (current airing time in England).
The first half of series 1 is already available in the UK on region 2 DVD with the rest out later this month... My wife and I watched the lot in only 3 sittings: we had to ration ourselves so as not to watch it all at once, although it was tempting.",1025481600,6,531,4.165048543689321
1455907,5,B00005JLF3,"Rumor is that Bravo recently bought the US rights to the first season for $1 Million an episode. So, to us here in the US, that means not only will NBC most likely not be replaying any episodes from the first season over the summer hiatus, but also that until that Bravo contract wears out, we won't be seeing any DVDs. The only way to get them now is to reinvest in a region free DVD player and purchase them through the UK. On the other hand, if we do ever get them, they'll probably be better (more features) than the ones they are seeing now. Small consolation, I know.",1022198400,9,573,4.218181818181818
1455908,5,B00005JLF3,"The West Wing was briefly available on DVD in Zone 2 (Europe) in the Spring, so we snapped it up. Volume one has the first 11 episodes so, unfortunately just when you get totally immersed into the characters and the plots (wonderfully developed and presented), you are left hanging with no ""Next week on the West Wing"" in sight.
Most people will not need a reason to watch the West Wing; Why buy the series on DVD? The best thing about West Wing on DVD is each episode is 45 minutes, without a single commercial, newsbreak orother interruption.
Bring on Volume 2.",1020816000,9,563,4.529411764705882
1455909,4,B00005JLF3,"...The complete first season, in standard full screen ratio, dolby digital 2.0. It's not feature laden by any means, but the important thing is that... the show stands on its own two feet. There are interviews with the cast and featurettes and all that. The picture transfer is superb. Shame about the sound, but then again there's never been much call for surround sound on this show. The dialouge is clean and crisp. Well worth the money. I hope... they go in for widescreen and 5.1 sound in the future editions...",1019779200,4,516,4.681318681318682

1456070,2,B00005JLF3,"Is there anything more sanctimonious / pollyannaish than this pap? And I'm a hardcore liberal. I give it two stars for the actors, but they ought to be ashamed of taking jobs where they have to deliver all this self- righteous dialogue. Also, does anyone really believe that people who've risen to the level of White House operatives can be so ridiculously naive?

1456072,5,B00005JLF3,Loving this show.  Was unable to watch it when it aired in the late 1990s but certainly enjoying the kinder/gentler politics.  Fabulous cast and script.  Have purchased and watched the entire series now and enjoyed every bit of it.  The picture and sound is nice and clear.  This season 1 has two-sided disks but the set I received is perfectly fine - has nice menus and subtitles.  No complaints at all.,1500249600,,404,4.619718309859155

The characters are real and relatable, and (usually) likeable. The writing is excellent: funny, smart, and emotional all at once without trying too hard in any one of those things. It is the perfect mix of large story-arch with individual episodes still standing well on their own.

I love, love, love it.",1486512000,,552,4.298076923076923

1456405,4,B00005JLF3,"Recently streamed The West Wing that I avoided when it was on network TV only because most shows are awful and I dismissed the medium as a whole. It is definitely superior watching and deserves kudos in all areas: writing, acting, directing and production. One caveat; due to the age of the show and the speed at which life changes the political and cultural issues are sometimes dated and lack the punch they might otherwise have. Along the same lines, there are no iphones or flat TVs!!!

1456808,4,B00005JLF3,"Very timely arrival.  Overall, I really liked the beginning of this series.  However, there were some issues in a couple of the stories that bothered me.  Because of these issues, I am hesitant to buy additional seasons.  For one, I didn't like the slam Christian churches were given.  And if this is any indication of the series' perspectives regarding Christian churches, I won't waste my money on additional seasons.  It seems that it is OK to slam Christian churches, and no one thinks ill of it.

Because I feel I need to express this: if a Christian church does not demonstrate the love of Christ, it is not a Christian church - plain and simple.  Christ said, ""By the fruits of their labors you will know them."" Matthew 7:16",1446940800,,731,4.612403100775194
1456809,5,B00005JLF3,"West Wing Season One has various well-known actors and actresses such as Allison Janney, Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe etc.  West Wing Season One is also a good tv show to watch for those who like to watch career trends related to public relations, advertising and/or ideas for career scriptwriting. For instance, there is a scene where Rob Lowe, a White House communications director,  is temporarily assigned to entertain a group of grade schoolers who won an essay contest. He gets nervous and wants to find out which kid is related to someone who he is trying to impress.  It turns out that the teacher of the class is the one he has to be concerned about because she ends up correcting him in regards to what he says about the Roosevelt Room named after Theodore Roosevelt (in real life there is a U.S. navy aircraft carrier also named after Roosevelt; i.e The USS Roosevelt). There is also a reference made to the USS Eisenhower (which I found interesting because I had been stationed on that ship before during part of my time in the  U.S. navy).  West Wing Season One in no way related to who I see becoming the Presidential nominees (it is obvious that it looks like that Trump is going to win the  Republican nomination while Clinton wins the Democratic nomination, I do prefer for Clinton to win yet I understand that this is not the review for me to elaborate doing so).",1446681600,,1375,4.569105691056911

I had a conception that is was going to be dry and boring (politics), it is witty, smart and enduring.

1457034,5,B00005JLF3,"As I revisit this series Im reminded of just how excellent it truly was (and remains). Aaron Sorkins writing features fast-paced dialogue replete with whip-cracking humor, truly intelligent banter, and always engrossing drama.  As my own writing style is very dialogue driven, its hard not to fall in love with him as a writer, and even harder to avoid studying him as homework for my own endeavors.  Experiencing the tracking camera as they walk and talkjust one of the many devices to accommodate this much dialogueis part of the fun.  But truly everything about this series is first rate and stellar, not the least of which is the casting and acting.  Highly recommended (although I appear to be just another voice in the chorus on that score.)",1426377600,,747,4.858267716535433

1457123,5,B00005JLF3,"I've never been able to commit to watching a series when it's originally broadcast - they're usually on too late in the evening for someone who gets to work before 7:00 a.m.!  And I know that the good series will end up in DVD or streaming video soon enough.

I know now why this was such a popular and long running series. The writing, casting, and cinematography are all first rate, and have stood the test of time. I've just finished Season 1, and other than a few technical details (they still use pagers, the cell phones are all flip phones, and social media is not yet a presence), you would not think that the series is over 15 years old. Each episode generally revolves around a single major incident or theme, and can be seen in isolation, however there are also through plots that build on the relationships of the characters and reveal their back stories. The glimpses into political maneuverings and government workings are fascinating, and I've read elsewhere that they are reasonably accurate. Each episode also seems to include a poignant emotional moment or message that reveals the humanity of the characters.

A nice feature of the series, so far, is that though the characters are all elected or appointed and certainly politically motivated, the underhanded, sometimes criminal activities that you see in movies or series such as House of Cards is entirely missing. These are characters that you can empathize with and feel good about the fact that they are running the country, at least fictionally.

From Mr. President, Martin Sheen who moves from the Oval Office to Situation Room where all the ranking Military meet to make major decisions, Charlie, his 21 year old personal aide, who does everything from getting coffee, to keeping unhappy problem visitors occupied until the President can get back to them,  C.J.,the Presidents Press Secretary, giving out news to the reporters assigned to the White House while keeping  Danny, the Head White House Reporter up to speed, on to Toby, Josh, Sam and all their secretaries,who know their bosses inside and out. There is no time too run out and get snacks and a drink unless you are watching reruns and can put it on hold. Rapid movement is the word for the show. Presidents of other countries, Commanders, Generals, and local heads of major companies around the country, find that the White House is busy and work long hours to 'make it all work' as best they can while also trying to meet and come to agreement with Senators and Representatives of Congress. Throw in travel to meet their constituents, around the country, bullets flying from groups with long term anger issues, and the daughter of the President dating her fathers personal aide, who happens to be black and you have a reason to 'Don't touch that dial' or make

The characters are complex, brought to life by the great cast.  You feel like you know these people and are inside the White House.  If you're still not sure about this series, watch the episode titled ""In Excelsis Deo"" - where a homeless vet freezes to death overnight in the Capital, wearing a coat with Toby's business card, very close to Christmas.  This show ends with editing scenes between a beautiful Christmas event at the White House, juxtaposed with the Arlington military funeral that Toby arranged.

1458261,5,B00005JLF3,"This show took a great concept and ran with it. The idea was to cover the people and situations behind the Oval Office and there is no show better at looking at the way politics works. If that isn't your thing, there's still great drama and comedy here, but it's especially delightful if you are interested in government.

The first season is arguably the best. The show pioneered the 'walk and talk' meeting with the camera following various characters as they walk through the White House. The President is interesting to watch but the behind-the-scenes snapshot of the West Wing means the President isn't necessarily the most interesting story of the week.

Acting is brilliant and many of the series regulars who were unknown when this first aired have gone on to bigger things, but this probably remains their best work. It's impossible not to watch Josh, Sam, Toby, C.J. and be fascinated with their strengths and many weaknesses. John Spencer's Leo is pitch perfect as he manages the chaos.

The West Wing was one that I really wanted to watch and have just finished all of the seasons.  In one way it was surprising how many of the plot lines corresponded to today's headlines.  While the players may change, politics seems to stay the same.  The actors are all talented and the writing is superb.  Although I limited myself to one episode a day during treadmill time, some of the episodes were so good that I was tempted to do another treadmill session just to see what happened next.  ;)  The quality stays consistent through all of the seasons so if one likes the show at the start, one can be reasonably sure of liking it until the finale.",1397952000,,797,4.344594594594595

Because some times the dialogue is so fast and very witty, one of the things I appreciate about watching it on Amazon is that if I miss what someone said, I can go back. And there are no commercials!",1397779200,,420,4.197530864197531

Six days ago I started to watch again and find I cannot stop, binge-watching often until 3:00 in the morning. I am now well into Season 2. What I never realized 14 years ago when the show first aired was how far ahead of the times the writers were. The political climate and the issues presented in the story-line are pertinent today. In a way it shows how little progress we have made in many areas of our politics in the last decade and a half. But at the same time, there were writers that foresaw the ever increasing stagnation of our political system so apparent over the last 8 years.

Who in this fantasy world is always right and always wins out at the end. If you dismiss the political brainwashing of the writers, the acting is good. The premise of non-elected people running the country seems to me (an independent) to be over blown. They are pushing the thesis that Americans who voted do not have a brain and cannot be trusted to have a real say in the governing of the nation. A real shame",1396137600,,562,4.466019417475728

I really enjoy being able to watch more than one show at a time. The show makes you feel as if you have a spy glass into the White House and the West Wing. The fast pace of the shows have an almost dizzying affect as the camera follows characters when they traverse the maze of offices and assistant pools that are in the West Wing. You really do feel as if you're there. The subjects of the plots are very close to many of the problems the White House is dealing with right now. I do realize it's another message show, however, it does entertain. It does make you think. It also makes you angry at times. Angry at some of the characters, angry at Congress, angry at the President. Any show that can produce emotions on that level is worth trying.  West Wing did leave me wondering how close to real life it is.",1395878400,,930,4.308571428571429

1458791,5,B00005JLF3,"This is American TV at its finest - lush cinematography, precise and detailed sets, rapid-fire dialogue scripting of the first order, intelligent characters with every human trait and foible imaginable. They rise to the occasion, sometimes falling to the floor, picking themselves up with as much dignity as possible and getting on with the business at hand. The directing is tight and clean, the camerawork superb, even if a little rapid as characters plunge through the White House West Wing.

And the acting! Every character is superbly cast, the interactions are as convincing as is possible in a staccato action drama, and the liberal (politically) slant to the story is consistent with many American Administrations. The entire ""feel"" of the first series is that this is as close as it gets to the reality of the high-pressure existence of staff in the West Wing.

My fiscally-conservative socially-liberal Republican philosophy rejects some of the positions of the depicted Administration. But the brilliance of the series is far too great to allow that minor clash to diminish the enjoyment I get from watching the denizens of the West Wing dance through the waltz of infinite themes that rise to the highest levels of government, occasionally stumbling over their personal weaknesses, but generally showing compassion, intelligence, humanity and astuteness.

I heartily recommend spending the time to work through the series, at your own pace. I'll wager that few who do will regret the experience. Like me, they will undoubtedly become addicted, and embark upon the full range of series, eager to see what next befalls the remarkable cast of characters.",1394496000,,1663,5.2209737827715355

So much of what we hear in political debate is about undermining the other side that we forget that our democracy is set up to invite people of principle to pitch in, to use their brains, to engage with others in a shared endeavor that makes policy that improves people's lives and makes a freer future possible. This show focuses attention on that aspect of the hard work of doing politics: people of good will, sifting through the frenzy of challenges and blind-side distractions, trying to find ways to get it right, so that their work does good things for other people.

1458953,5,B00005JLF3,"One of the ""presidential"" TV series which actually relied on past & current events for its material. Martin Sheen did an excellent job in his portrayal of Jed Barlet.",1393372800,,166,4.758620689655173
1458954,5,B00005JLF3,The dialogue is so crisp and smart.  The stories so intriguing and well paced.  Very little that is produced today comes close To the quality of this series.,1393372800,,157,4.571428571428571

1458957,5,B00005JLF3,"The West Wing is one of the best TV series ever  a real classic. The characters are so well defined and brought to life in an extraordinary way.  One of the things I really appreciate about Aaron Sorkin is how he presents men in deep relationships of respect, loyalty and love with strength and commitment: the relationship between the President and Leo is one example. Actually, all the characters are excellently formed, leading one to get more and more invested in them.  One could write pages about the characters!

The writing, the photography, the acting  all really first rate.  The fact that you may not be interested in politics is not important; the show will draw you in without insisting that you agree with anything.

Highly recommended!",1393027200,,750,4.858267716535433
1459003,5,B00005JLF3,"My husband had never watched this show when it originally aired. We started watching the episosodes recently, and are very surprised at the issues they deal with and how they are handled. Many of the issues are relevant to issues we face today.

1459004,5,B00005JLF3,"This is drama, as good as it gets in the mid-nineties. A little less tightly woven that ""The Good Wife,"" but engrossing, and well worth a second look if you caught the series while it was on TV.",1392940800,,194,4.131578947368421

1459009,5,B00005JLF3,"A great ensemble cast of relative unknowns brought cohesion and superb acting to our living rooms each Sunday night. If not for the unexpected death of Leo (John Spencer), the show would still be on the air with Jimmy Smitts in the roll of his life, running the Oval Office.

1459011,5,B00005JLF3,It is very relevant today.  People should watch The West Wing as it gives some insight into the many nuances of how decisions are made at The White House.  Being President is a very tough job and it is not a one man show.  Here one can vicariously walk a mile in the President's shoes.,1392681600,,285,4.1454545454545455

1459072,5,B00005JLF3,"Even though this show is several years old, it is still the best show ever put on television! Yes it has a liberal spin, after all it's based on a Democrat as President. I'm a Republican and love it, even though my friends and family won't watch it because it's too liberal. This show has the right cast and chemistry. The screen writing is superb, witty, funny, and educational. The first four seasons are great and I enjoyed the last season. Seasons 5 and 6 got a little stale. They should have added some new screen writers in conjunction with the original ones to add some spice. But if the show does not captivate you by episode 8 of season 1 (my favorite), then you probably should move on to something else. No disrespect intended, but if you are not addicted by episode 8, the show is just probably too intelligent for you to grasp the stories.",1392595200,,852,4.43312101910828

1459074,5,B00005JLF3,"For a second time I turned to Amazon to watch the entire series of The West Wing. An epoch continuum of entertainment, I  was driven by a need for mental stimulation, rich character development and plausible story lines - three factors in abundance from master writer Aaron Sorkin. The casting seems more inspired with each episode and years later, the premise, the acting and the writing are fresh AND refreshing. The quality of this production shames what passes today for entertainment.",1392422400,,489,5.037037037037037

1459079,5,B00005JLF3,"I forgot how marvelous this series was and is and has not become outdated. What is depicted in this drama is still occurring in D.C.  The acting is superb and the stories riveting. Dulle Hill shows ability far above the show he is currently wasted in. The interaction among the cast makes it one of the best series ever on TV. I watch in the evenings because it is far better than anything on currently.

1459080,5,B00005JLF3,"If you enjoyed ""The Newsroom"" you will enjoy this show.  It is laced with both the drama and the humor of political situations.

1459149,5,B00005JLF3,The plots are interesting and totally believable.  Each episode was masterly written.  The acting is superb and the love situations are never offensive.  Authors also managed to include some comedy.  I just loved this series.,1391990400,,225,5.3428571428571425
1459150,5,B00005JLF3,"First season is some of the funniest, well written dialogue of any tv series I've ever watched. If you can just pretend Mandy didn't exist, it's the perfect must watch!",1391990400,,168,4.633333333333334
1459151,5,B00005JLF3,I still can't get enough of this show. Watching just one episode tends to get me watching half-a-season of episodes.,1391990400,,116,4.85

1459155,5,B00005JLF3,"Brilliant writing and acting-should have gone on for more years than it did. A wonderful show for those who enjoy drama without violence. Yes, it's written from a liberal, idealistic point of view but the situations portrayed could just as well occur with a conservative White House. The characters are richly developed from the start & continue that development throughout the series.",1391904000,,385,5.225806451612903

1459359,5,B00005JLF3,"Unfortunately, very few shows on TV have the remarkable writing and character development that The West Wing has.  I don't know if it is the fault of the networks since they are running very short seasons so the audience just starts to get interested and then it is ""The Season Finale"" after 10 shows or because they allow very little time for a show to catch an audience or it is immediately cancelled.  Maybe it is partially the fault of the public for devouring the ""reality"" shows and badly written, predictable 30 minute comedies.  Whatever the reasons, although there are still some well written and produced shows available, The West Wing is one of the most  witty, engaging, thought provoking and entertaining series produced.  The actors are amazing and the story lines were sometimes amusing, sometimes heart-wrenching, and sometimes both.  Excellent",1391472000,,860,5.0638297872340425
1459360,5,B00005JLF3,"Somehow during the years the West Wing was on (I think '99-'06), I never watched it.  Recently, it was suggested to me by Amazon and as a Prime member made available.  I love love love it and am thrilled that there are more seasons in store!",1391472000,,241,4.217391304347826

1459414,5,B00005JLF3,"Not being much of a television watcher I missed this show when it was current, but heard great things about it. In early January 2014, I started going to the gym regularly, and I know how quickly I get bored when it comes to exercise. Music or the constantly running television won't do it for me. So I decided videos was the way to go. I download the episodes to my Kindle Fire, pug in my earphones, and watch them while on the treadmill.

This show is excellent, with a great ensemble cast and a story line that keeps me interested. There have been a few times when I stayed on the treadmill a few minutes longer because I wanted to see what happens next. I highly recommend this, and will be buying the next season soon.",1391299200,,723,4.2773722627737225

His staff and their history also attribute to the making of the new Presidency.  Current events occurring during the filming of this TV show were also incorporated into the Season.

1459635,5,B00005JLF3,"When West Wing was on originally I did not watch even one episode.  Recently a friend mentioned it and thought I'd enjoy and appreciate it.  The first few episodes were table setters for characters and overarching thematic elements.  Once that was established I found myself hooked!  Dialogue is smart, quick and topical even for today.  The acting is great, characters quirky and real, especially Allison Janney as CJ and Richard Schiff as Toby Ziegler.  Highly recommend it (especially since you can watch it commercial free!).",1389657600,,529,5.1647058823529415

1459836,5,B00005JLF3,"The West Wing is the reality of governance: high ideals, strong principles, flawed characters and daily crises. The writing of this show set a new standard of SMART -- issues, ideas, strategies, and a President criticised for being ""too smart"". Heck, isn't that the one you want at the helm?!?!  Every episode of TWW educates us on how government really works (when it's working) and how deals get done to move this country forward: compromise, communication, compassion, character, all are present in each story line, whether you agree with the outcome or not.

Every member of Congress should be watching this show from beginning to end at the start of every session. There are great lessons here about what Americans really want from their leaders.",1389139200,,751,5.0
1459837,5,B00005JLF3,"Great cast and superb writing. I had watched a few episodes when it aired.

""The Newsroom"" which we love was the original writer for this show for 88 episodes.  It is face paced and excellent.  Defiinitely a thumbs-up show.",1389052800,,400,4.823529411764706
1459840,5,B00005JLF3,OMG! I was hooked after the first episode...actually after the first 5 minutes. Aaron Sorkin knows how to create real-life fiction.

Just the fact that you can start an episode and stop two minutes in for whatever reason and then come right back to it....by far getting PRIME is the best thing I've done.  I just hope I don't run out of things to watch.,1389052800,,395,4.090909090909091

1459947,5,B00005JLF3,"I loved this show when it was in first run, but now that I'm older and know a little more about government, I appreciate it even more.  Writer Sorkin is so good at writing touching moments that you hear with your ears and feel in your heart.  The actors are superb at communicating these moments with words, but  also with their faces and bodies.  I am finding that the issues the characters deal with (gun control, hate crimes, veterans issues, etc.) are things we are still dealing with today.  The show holds up well over time.",1388880000,,530,4.479166666666667

1460074,5,B00005JLF3,Aaron Sorkin's idealized drama about the fictional Democratic administration of Jed Bartlett (played wonderfully by Martin Sheen) holds up very well more than a decade later.  Worth watching most nights that any sitcom is on network TV.,1388793600,,236,5.378378378378378

1460270,4,B00005JLF3,"I think the west wing was a very good series till about season 6.  Most people hate watching presidential races live, why in God's name they chose one for the topic of a season 6-7, let alone a show.  I just watched the pilot and there aren't two more arrogant, dislikable characters than Toby and Mandy.  No wonder she didn't make it, and Toby's character was unbelievably arrogant right until the end.  The pilot sucked.  Like the title says, cant believe it made it out of the gates.",1388016000,,486,4.4772727272727275

1460274,5,B00005JLF3,Watched one episode when it originally aired in 1999 but found it boring.  And I'm a huge Aaron Sorkin fan but I think I was still bitter over his abandoning Sports Night to work on West Wing so I never could get into it.  I'm so glad that I started to watch this now as a virgin viewer of the show.  It's smart and funny and as politically relevant today as it was 15 years ago.  Even if you were a viewer when the show was on TV I highly recommend that you revisit it today.  This is what made great television.,1387497600,,513,3.9901960784313726

I had also read good reviews on 'The West Wing' so I thought I'd see for myself. I was not disappointed! It's well cast, certainly well written and, although I've not been in The White House, the sets seem realistic. I especially like the quick pace of the dialogue and the insight
I've picked up regarding how 'things are done' politically.
All in all, worth watching.

1460571,5,B00005JLF3,"In 2013, TV viewers can watch reality TV, reveling in the banality and downright crudity of the common man, talent shows which are a moderately successful attempt to play upon the Horatio Alger myth, tugging on the public's heart strings by weekly parading the hopeful and the ne'er-do-wells in front of group of successful, but often overbearing or vulgar judges, whose behavior either adds comic relief or more drama to event that is ""staged"" in more ways than one.  The remainder of the ""watch list"" is either formulaic cop's shows combining Sisyphus with a Rube Goldberg script contraption: complex, lots of action, but little accomplished, and each week the process is repeated again and again and again, or comedy that plays upon the mundane to modest effect.

  While there are legitimate criticisms of the West Wing, these pale in comparison to the endeavor and its context.  The West Wing never played to crudity, banal sexuality or ""guffaw"" comedy when most shows did, and still do.  It offered a window, albeit a rose colored one, on the presidency and those supporting the office in the endeavor to govern fairly.  Better said, it was people coming to together to ensure no one got left behind.  Full of soaring, and sometimes saccharine rhetoric, it explored many issues of the day with insight and humor.  High-minded without being pretentious, the West Wing consistently provided food for the mind and soul, rare at the time, nearly impossible to find now.

  TV offers us so little in terms of vision.  Shows like the Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Desperate Housewives, while well done and entertaining revel in the worst, or at least the commonplace, in us, whether it was greed, hatred, lust or desperation.  If we heap plaudits and awards upon those shows that glory in people at their most base, vile and malicious, then certainly we must take a moment to praise those that try to achieve something  better, endeavoring to show people motivated by what is best in us: compassion, insight and the desire to serve .  The West Wing reminded us that while government is flawed because we are flawed, it can be, as we can be...an instrument of good.",1386374400,,2162,4.866120218579235

Mindless in that no one will read this, so it does not matter. One man's realization and nothing else.
A decade plus ago, we were blessed with a television series of consequence to those who had time to pay attention, to those that seem to realize time is flying by and will soon be gone, as in done, done-done. This series made a difference in my awareness of the grandness of things, of possibilities. Of possibilities lost. I'd like to think we are worthy but the reality is we are not. We are only people. Nothing special about any of us other than the love we unknowingly bring out in others.
The TV series?
West Wing: it's available start to finish, all 140 or so episodes, for nothing other than a Amazon Prime membership. I defy one to watch the first years episode 10 without crying as I did. We are only people. What a disappointment that is.

I won't even proffer a guess as to how many times I've watched the series, little marathons, if you will, but suffice it to say, it's quite a lot.

But the stories are rather boring and the show, over all, is preachy, pretentious and very sanctimonious.  Also, when you realize it ran at the same time as the Bush administration, you realize how absolutely unrealistic the show is. Overall, a nice distraction, but not a great show.  I think HBO's Veep is probably a more actuate portrayal of politics in Washington.",1378425600,,536,4.752688172043011

The issues that they presented about 13 years ago are still very relevant, even after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",1378166400,,367,4.575757575757576
1461312,5,B00005JLF3,"I loved this show when it was live on the air.  It is like having time with an old friend.  The writing is clear, concise, Intelligent and funny.  The acting is spot on!  I am thinking of starting a ""Bartlet for President"" group.  If only we thought that the real West Wing, either Democrat or Republican, worked this way.

With the original air date starting in 2000, I am amazed at how many of the issues that were used as backdrop in the show are the same issues that we are still dealing with today. . . . .  Gay rights, race relations, the death penalty, military spending, aid to education, just to name a few.  This is definitely the show for intelligent, thinking viewers.

That said, my Kindle HD 8.9 handles the video without a glitch,  The sound is clear and the controls are easy to use.  There is background info on the actors available.  I have moved on to Season 2.  Yeah, there are 9 seasons in total.",1377907200,,917,4.323529411764706

1461487,5,B00005JLF3,"Not only is The West Wing technically among the best dramatic presentations I have ever seen, the subject matter is so timeless that instead of the late 1990s, it might well be today. Many of the situations being faced by the Bartlett White House are echoing through the news media and the halls of Congress today. Moreover, the political maneuvering and horse trading necessary to get things done in Washington appears not to have changed at all.

From the intermittent reading of the Constitution to the trade-offs between idealism and practicality, this is American government writ large. I am certain that Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln would recognize the maneuvers and necessities as being the same ones they faced. This series should be required for all students, and for all citizens.",1377129600,,798,5.091603053435114

Witty writing and awesome actors make this drama-with-humor series one of the best shows ever to grace our television and now computer screens. The only sad note is that Martin Sheen's character sets the bar too high for any real-life president to even begin to live up to.

1461670,5,B00005JLF3,"I'm too young to say this, but I'm going to say it anyway: they just don't make tv like this anymore. This show was epic in the same way that Friends was epic (even had a tiny cameo appearance by Matthew Perry!) - just a different genre. The cast was amazing, and both the writing acting was of such an uncommonly superior caliber that the show remains one of the best there is.

Yes, you have to have a passing interest in politics to enjoy this. Personally, I think it's best if you occasionally take a break to watch something else so you can appreciate it again, rather than continuously watching it without interruption. Either way, solid gold performance by the main cast, including the dearly departed Kathryn Joosten, who played Mrs. Landingham, and John Spencer, who played the iconic and unforgettable cornerstone character of Leo McGarry.

Writing, acting,storyline,  It hits all sides of the political spectrum from joy to sorrow and every conceivable emotion in between.  Once you start watching one you cannot stop.

1461747,2,B00005JLF3,"The script is good and the acting is good. Great cast. So why only 2 stars? Because it drives me crazy that much, if not most, of the dialogue takes place why they are walking frantically down hallways. I'd say half of the conversations are conducted that way and I hate it. Conversations are interrupted while they walk to yell at someone passing them at an intersection of corridors. I just don't understand why they have to do that. I guess they want to show they everything is moving at a frantic pace - all the time. Very annoying.",1375228800,,536,4.424242424242424

The actors, the writing and direction, the settings, the continuity.... all are simply brilliant.  This series is a few years out of date, but I can still watch it over and over because it's so very good and so very different from the unmittigated schlock to be found in every corner of TV.

The acting is top-notch though sometimes the scenarios are a bit far-fetched in the name of maintaining pace. More than once I have compared the WW President favorably with today's leaders.

1462430,5,B00005JLF3,The writing by Aaron Sorkin is unparalleled -- often imitated but never equalled. Everyone would like Martin Sheen to be the real president. Too bad it is just fiction.,1371340800,,168,4.827586206896552
1462431,5,B00005JLF3,"When WW came out I was a SportsNight viewed. Loved the cast, characterizations and stories. I then heard that Aaron Sorken was developing another show and let this one drift off course. I resented the heck out of WW for just that. A few summers ago I caught the last of a run on cable but only got to see about a week's worth. That was more than enough to get me hooked. It truly spoke to me. My mission was to search for the Dvds for all the seasons which I did through Amazon.  The Dvds all came quickly  and in great condition. Then the fun began. I went through 3 viewings immediately. Everything I loved about SportsNight was quickly surpassed by the WW. These well used Dvds were viewed at least 3 to 5 more times until I purchased my Kindle Fire a year ago. Naturally I bought a subscription to Prime and saw that they offered the WW FREE! I was in hog heaven for now I could watch it anywhere and any time at my own convenience. What a bargain Prime is! The quality is as good as the Dvds and they download quickly.  I can truly say I have NO complaints about either format or their prices. BTW by using Amazon I saved a lot o
n the Dvds by buying used and new from their independent sellers. I encourage you all to do the same. You won't be disappointed.",1371340800,,1263,4.146938775510204
1462432,5,B00005JLF3,Loved it. At first it was slow to get the flow going. As you fallow the show it all comes into place. Don't know how accurate or as close to the real thing they got to it. It looked real to me as to how the West Wing would run. Once you start to see it you will not let it go till you see all 7 seasons.,1371168000,,303,3.4705882352941178
1462433,5,B00005JLF3,"Did not watch it during its original network run but heard it was a fantastic show.  Thank goodness for online streaming, I was not disappointed!  it is one of the best TV shows ever produced.",1371168000,,192,4.457142857142857
1462434,5,B00005JLF3,Well written and witty. Gives insight into some high political decisions whether truthful or not.  Interaction between different characters is interesting.,1371168000,,155,6.380952380952381
1462435,5,B00005JLF3,"One of the best TV shows ever produced.  I forgot how good the writing in this show was.
it's funny, to me, how the more things change the more they stay the same or how life imitates art.",1371168000,,188,3.9473684210526314
1462436,5,B00005JLF3,"Brilliantly written, wonderfully acted, from the pilot to the season finale it is excellent.  The first 4 season of The West Wing (Aaron Sorkin only wrote the first 4 seasons), are some of, if not, the best TV ever made.",1371081600,,220,4.5
1462437,5,B00005JLF3,"No commercial breaks, great resolution and sound.  The best way to get back with this old friend.  Check it out!",1371081600,,112,4.55
1462438,5,B00005JLF3,"The West Wing Season 1 was an outstanding viewing experience.  The show was very well written, and the performances by all were captivating.  This was some of the best television that I have watched since Friday Night Lights.  Highly recommended!",1371081600,,246,5.1
1462439,5,B00005JLF3,"I watched the original showings and have seen so many re.runs I can anticipate dialogue. Whether you agree politically or not, you cannot deny the writing will never be duplicated.",1371081600,,180,5.033333333333333

1462534,5,B00005JLF3,"The acting demonstrates what TV should be.  Every scene is so real. I haven't seen a show that held my interest this much since ""The Thornbirds."" Now I know what all the fuss was about and I regret not watching it first time around. I honestly can't say that one actor is better than another. They're all that good. I feel like I'm really in the Oval Office with the President of the United States. The dialogue is fast paced and not only is it high drama, there is a lot of humor. ""The West Wing,"" is proof that incorporating vile language is not necessary to write an intelligent and remarkable program. I look forward to watching all 6 seasons.  Thanks Amazon for making it available to those of us who were too dopey to catch it originally.",1370822400,,744,4.384057971014493

1462536,5,B00005JLF3,The West Wing has to be the best written show for TV.  You feel empathy with the characters and literally laugh out loud at the wit.  Great show.,1370649600,,145,4.142857142857143
1462537,5,B00005JLF3,"The dialog is witty, the topics relevant even today, and the characters are well-developed. There are some sloppy elements in some of the episodes, but these are usually insignificant. Overall, it is very enjoyable to watch a series that featured writing you simply do not find in current programming.",1370649600,,301,5.163265306122449
1462538,5,B00005JLF3,Love the characters.  Very interesting show.  Plan to watch the remainder of the series.  Highly recommended it if you like political dramas.,1370649600,,141,5.318181818181818

1462629,5,B00005JLF3,I enjoyed watching West Wing during reruns years ago and started watching the series from the beginning on the recommendation of a friend.  I had forgotten how well written it was and how fast paced the dialogue was.  The topics are surprising current.  I now enjoy the episodes with a different perspective and a new appreciation.,1370476800,,331,4.875
1462630,5,B00005JLF3,"This is our second time going through this series as a family. ( Ages 13-55)  Always appreciate good writing that can entertain and  educate with intelligence.

1462631,5,B00005JLF3,"I loved this series when it was new.  I'm really enjoying re-watching these characters who had become like good friends.  Even if you don't agree with the politics, it is very enjoyable, great cast, and good character development.",1370390400,,230,5.026315789473684

1462634,5,B00005JLF3,i noticed this is the 3rd season for this program that i had never watched.  1st season I was not able to accomplish much work at home until i finished the 22 episodes.  good entertainment and characters.  curious if this is a close to true version of how things really work around the White House.,1370217600,,298,4.381818181818182

1462728,5,B00005JLF3,"Even though the show deals with fictional events, it is well-written and acted.

1462732,5,B00005JLF3,"Even the second time around, this is a very entertaining fast paced romp. The dialogue and verbal pyrotechnics go by so quickly that one is tempted to back up every now and again to review. Sorkin and the cast were on the top of there form when this was made, and it even though a bit dated, it has current relevance. Some will be gratified and others annoyed, but all will be entertained.",1369699200,,389,4.342465753424658

1462990,5,B00005JLF3,I love this show.  Personally I have all the seasons on DVD but still like the convenience of watching it anywhere with my Prime membership. They don't make shows like this anymore that make you think!  If you never watched the series when it was on I highly recommend it. If you watched it while it was on you might want to watch it again. It certainly merits a second and third and fiftieth viewing!!! Personally I watch all the seasons from start to finish two or three three times a year. Best show ever!!!!!,1368921600,,512,4.378947368421053

1462995,5,B00005JLF3,"This is really a good drama on the inner workings of the White House. The charcters are believable, including the Prsident. There is some comedic moments to relieve the tension (i.e. the Presient trying to get 15 minutes of alone time with the First Lady) There even some touching ones. I started watching this series 2 seasons into the show. I am glad I can now catch up on the ones I missed and review the old ones. What I like about the series is that each show is stand alone and comes to an end each week. It is not an on-going soap opera type of show. The character og C.J. Crag, the press secretary, is based on Dee Dee Myers of the first Clinton adminsitration. She is even a consultant for the show.",1368144000,,708,4.2518518518518515

It took me a while to learn to follow the fast-paced and disjointed conversations happening on the screen. I guess I had anticipated the show to be more serious and leaning extreme to the left. Although there are times where that is true it is also a show packed with witty one liners that is not afraid to poke fun at any view point.
Great, entertaining show with stories you can get involved with. The politics are just a vehicle for the entertainment and can change as fast as most Washington's politicians opinions.",1367107200,,594,4.613207547169812

1464001,5,B00005JLF3,"I watched this series when it first aired.  Watching a second time, I forgot how great this show is.  There is a good mix of characters, as well as storylines.  Plus I learn a few things here and there.  Fun AND educational!",1363478400,,224,4.261904761904762
1464002,5,B00005JLF3,"While I only watched this series off and on when it was showing, I have truly enjoyed watching it back to back.  All the characters are believable in their roles.  It really gives you pause to think about all that seemingly goes on 'behind the scenes' of the White House.",1363478400,,271,4.4
1464003,5,B00005JLF3,"We watched the last few seasons on TV,  it is fun to catch up from the beginning using Amazon Prime, and our Roku!",1363478400,,114,3.9565217391304346
1464004,5,B00005JLF3,The characters are people you want to get to know and follow in their lives.  Having actual events blended into the scripts increases the meat of the plots.  I look forward to finishing the whole series.,1363478400,,203,4.611111111111111
1464005,5,B00005JLF3,"Look in the credits for Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme and you'll get good (make that great!) TV.
The West Wing has to be on everyone's top ten list.
One of the best TV shows . . .ever!
Crisp writing, perfect casting, credible story lines and very high production values earn this series a Five Star rating.
This my third time around watching this great series and each episode still feels brand new.
Getting a group (cast and crew) like this one together is catching lightning in a bottle. Doesn't happen too often and when it does you get a show worth watching (again & again).
There aren't too many shows that I consider flawless. This is one of them.",1363478400,,656,4.475
1464006,5,B00005JLF3,"I very much enjoyed West Wing when it first aired!  My husband and I now watch the next episode weekly. It's super cool to be able to watch the double episodes without having to wait a week (if we choose :-D) Watching it over, in sequence as it was shown all those years ago, we get to enjoy it all over again! AND I appreciate the perk especially as a Prime member!
Thanks, Amazon!",1363478400,,382,4.162162162162162

1464090,5,B00005JLF3,"This is a show all about politics, obviously. But it's so much more. It's touching, inspiring, witty, funny, intelligent, and thought provoking. And with all that it offers insight into all kinds of people's lives and political ideologies and helps to recognize that there are many different valid viewpoints, but underneath that we can still find common ground and work together.  It might be the best television show I've ever seen. I lean conservative, but as far as empathizing with the difficult lives and jobs of the white house, and thinking about how morals apply in difficult situations, this is it. But if you're looking sheerly for entertainment, every episode is quick paced, funny, and snappy.",1363219200,,706,5.086206896551724

I am re-watching the entire series from beginning to finish right now and I never tire of it. It is smart , and clever, and funny and serious, and tender all rolled into one fabulous show. I rarely watch tv. And it is rarer still for me to tune in every week to see any show. But The West Wing was my one exception. I love this show!",1363219200,,481,4.127659574468085

1464177,5,B00005JLF3,The fast pace and excellent character portrayals make this both an entertaining as well as informative series to watch.

1464264,5,B00005JLF3,"This is a feel good series about the way we wish things ran in Washington, where people care for each other and the nation as a whole -- where an individual is important and cherished.  It's also very funny as well as dramatic and addresses issues that are timeless.

I really wish Jed Bartlett was president.,1362441600,,341,4.2615384615384615

1464377,5,B00005JLF3,It continues to show what a fine series it was.  It gives an idea of how really bright and motivated the Presidents support staff must be.  For the most part the young ones are dedicated.  The work is hard their ideals are high...So much complexity in running of government in the White House. .,1362182400,,295,4.425925925925926

1464384,2,B00005JLF3,Can't understand why this show was popular.  The only good thing about it was Martin Sheen.  Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance.  I only watched about five or six episodes.  Couldn't take any more.,1361836800,,204,4.4324324324324325
1464476,5,B00005JLF3,This is a never ending story that Sorkin did and it's timeless characters are great.  The sense of humor and level of inteligence written for this program is FANTASTIC.

1464477,5,B00005JLF3,"I didn't watch this series when it was first broadcast, so have been delighted to encounter it online since. What wonderful scripting and ensemble cast! It's very well done and educational about the speed and multiplicity of issues that come to bear in our legislative and governmental process. It's always about so much more than the actual issue seemingly on the table. The West Wing provides a useful civics lesson each episode as well as pure entertainment for those who prefer theirs with a literate bent. I heartily recommend this.",1361836800,,537,4.977777777777778
1464478,5,B00005JLF3,"I am a fan. Yes, my political views coincide with this administration but the wonderful interplay of the lead actors is what kept me glued to the series. The opposition ( the republican view ) was refreshingly represented by Ainsley ....
I simply felt a part of the crew and identified strongly with each character. Though the beginning of the 5th season was less sparking, it finally picked up pace in the final episodes. Yes, the Aaron Sorkin four years were splendid but season 6 and 7, though a vastly different style satisfied. All in all, a definite 5 stars and worth every penny.",1361836800,,586,4.644230769230769

1464534,5,B00005JLF3,This is one of the best written scripts of any program I have ever watched. It is is written in such a way that each scene is able to stand on its own. It was one of my favorite shows when it aired and it is one of my favorite shows AA I am watching it again.,1361664000,,259,3.56140350877193

1464583,5,B00005JLF3,I forgot how good this series was. Fourteen years have passed but the writing holds up and gives you great stories. Hard to believe that many of the problems encountered on the West Wing could have happened in 2013. The characters are real and the acting is excellent. I love being able to watch these stories again.,1361404800,,316,4.56140350877193

This series teaches a little about government, political views (though with the obvious slant to the left) and also entertains.  The writing, directing, and acting are all top notch.  I'm still waiting for the reunion.  C'mon, Aaron, it's been way too long!!",1361145600,,344,4.590163934426229

1464645,5,B00005JLF3,I love  The West Wing. This series got me through the Bush presidential years. years. I operated in the alternate universe. Josiah Bartlett was my president during those years.

I realize that there isn't quite as much sunshine and happiness as is shown on television, but I have learned more about the deal-making and backstabbing that goes on - they certainly didn't teach us about that in civics class (how old am I, right?)  Anyway, what I thought was supposed to be a show about a noble profession has become just as drama-filled as any daytime soap opera.  So, it's enjoyable to watch, there's lots of things going on, constant crises and hardly any of them have to do with running the country.

I love it!  LOL",1360713600,,648,4.420168067226891
1464688,5,B00005JLF3,"Writing like this is a lost art.  This series was terrific, every show was great.  The cast could not have been better. The music is haunting.  I would recommend including this in everyones library.",1360713600,,198,4.764705882352941
1464689,4,B00005JLF3,"I've been watching the series streamed on my Amazon Prime.  Having never seen the show prior to this stretch, and really not following the critical acclaim for the show, I'd really never felt inspired to tackle the series until after watching and enjoying ""The Newsroom"" by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin.

I'm sure that the one or two of you that happen to stumble on my review, and have bothered to continue to read it, are probably more familiar with the show than I was, and regardless of what I have to say, have or will watch it regardless.  All I can say is that it is a real kudos to NBC that they let the show be produced with such a magnificent standard of intelligence that one has to either be sharp as a tack to follow it live, or else they rewatch a recorded copy.  Nonetheless, it moves fast in it's dialog and presumes that folks will keep up.

I'm currently now into Season 4.  I have no idea what's to come (other than I'd heard in advance about changes in the Presidents staff due to health and contractual issues with certain actors) but I'm thoroughly engaged in the action.  I'd also heard that Season 4 was the last for Mr. Sorkin; if the series noticeably suffers as a result, I may drop out of the series.

For now, I will say that the acting and writing is absolutely terrific, the flow of the action works well, and (perhaps the greatest compliment) that the show's various stories not only arc from episodes and moments within the season, but even moments from earlier seasons.  Which means that, to follow certain story lines, you really need to watch the whole series.  I so admire that in a series.  It works on it's own terms, and expects it's audience to comply.

For all of my heaps of praise, I will add that it's not perfect (thus 4 stars).  While NBC does deserve it's kudos, it remains a very idealized version of American politics.  So far anyway, it tackles some complexities but avoids others, such as the influence of money in politics and various matters of corruption.

Also, President Bartlett and his staff seem like an immensely likeable and extraordinarily intelligent bunch, fast thinking and amazingly clever, it's a bit irritating that there's hardly any noticeable deviation from this characterization.  I know this is Sorkin (I see it on ""The Newsroom"" as well) but it still makes the show feel like a show... contrived.  I start with shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Breaking Bad"" as the 5-star bar, where the characters are much more complex and fully realized.  On West Wing, the characters are simply less believable as real people.

So, to sum up, after 3-1/2 seasons, I'm really impressed with the groundbreaking standard of quality for West Wing as a network TV series, but for all of it's admirable qualities, it's not as great as some of the non-network TV shows I've seen.",1360713600,,2833,4.607569721115538

The outstanding dialogue and incredible acting made the the west wing seemed more real than our actual president at the time. It came out in 2000 just after the supreme court had decided an election rather than the voters. The real presidency seemed more unreal than the comfort-food presidency of Jeb Bartlett.

More than being comforting it motivated my politifcal involvement in the real world. That government might just be full of good people that want to do the right things to make the country better, but may disagree on how to do it. The inspriation of the west wing help me shake the words of President Regan when he said ""government is the problem"". It isn't the problem, unless it's made to be. Government can be a solution and I want to help it succeed in making things better for all of us.

I've already ordered the next three seasons so that I don't have to go through withdrawal when I finish the first one. The characters are first rate, and the actors, mostly not that well known, are very good in their parts.

The story lines hold your attention and seem plausible, and make me glad I never became President.

There's a bit too much of the ""too cutesy"" dialog where two characters repeat the same lines several times...same problem that happened with Sorkin's ""Sports Night,"" but they toned that down in that series, so I'm hoping it will slowly fade away in this one also. Otherwise, the best indication of how I like that series is that I watch one a day unless I am away from home.

MAY 2013 UPDATE: I'm now making my way through Season 6, with one more season to go, and I'm already feeling ""pre-withdrawal"" symptoms knowing that I won't have new episodes to watch in a few weeks. I'll watch it all again in four or five years (at my age I can forget a LOT in that amount of time).

Season six has a sequence of episodes that deal with the next presidential campaign, following three Democrats and one Republican, none of them Jed Barlett of course. I'm finding this ""campaign trail"" stuff less captivating than the usual day to day White House operations, but I'm sure we'll get back there soon. And they DID in fact tone down the ""cutesy dialog.""

I have to say I miss Rob Lowe, who was excellent in his part. His departure is balanced by my discovery of two actors I was not familiar with, John Spencer and Allison Janney. (Janney fans can see her in a sitcom coming in the fall of 2013, but of course, she won't be equal to CJ Craig.)",1354492800,,1829,4.383480825958702

1464990,4,B00005JLF3,"After watching ""The Kennedy's Miniseries"" on DVD, I needed to watch a more in-depth view of the Presidency and how it functions for our country. So I read many reviews and decided the ""West Wing"" was worth purchasing.  I loved the emphasis on the President's daughter so that the viewer could get a feel for how the Presidential family is impacted by the Presidency.  Also, Rob Lowe was such a refreshing part of the mix that I really missed him when he left.  The fact that the Republican female character who resided in the basement in the White House kept getting replaced made the show a little choppy for me, especially the character from the Deep South, who was intelligent, witty and a great asset to the show.

Through about Season 4, I was pretty fascinated and pleased with the series.  So I purchased the remaining DVD sets of ""The West Wing."" Unfortunately after Season 4, I realized I was burnt out and had gotten tired of the constantly clipped language of the players and bored with the show in general. I'll probably finish it in this next year.

All the actors are excellent, especially the President and the First Lady.  With 4 stars, I definitely recommend the series--just don't purchase too many DVD sets ahead as you are watching it.",1348272000,,1255,4.65158371040724

The political issues addressed in the series are the same issues being addressed in politics today.

1464998,5,B00005JLF3,"The West Wing is one of the best shows to have aired in the past 20 years, and probably in all of television. It is an hour long drama that focuses on the inner workings of the White House. The pilot finds the White House's staff still adjusting to their newly won roles: a deputy chief of staff makes a gaffe on television, the president injures himself in an accident, and most pressing, over 1000 Cuba refugees are currently making their way to Miami, Florida.  Viewers can expect similar plot lines packed into each episode.

Creator Aaron Sorkin (who writes almost every episode in the first four seasons of the show) does a fantastic job keeping the drama interesting and realistic. The characters are well developed, and the dialogue is spectacular. It's hard to keep up with what it is exactly everyone does here in this first episode, but it quickly comes together in subsequent episodes. There is political rhetoric here, and while the administration featured here is Democrat, much of the sensibilities here are populist rather than partisan. Republicans won't be angered, etc... Sorkin does a great job straddling the line and giving both sides great platforms.

The first season ends with a pretty massive cliff hanger that will leave viewers scrambling to watch the next season.  The ending isn't completely unexpected -- there are hints to it earlier in the season, but it is shocking nonetheless.

1465095,5,B00005JLF3,"I only watched occasional episodes during ""The West Wing""'s prime-time run...but loved it when I had the chance to be at home and enjoy the show. On the strength of that somewhat limited evidence of liking the show, I recently (on an educated whim)took the plunge and purchased ALL of the individual seasons when they were (all) ""on sale"" at Amazon.com.!

Am I glad I did! I am completely hooked! Over the last few months I have devoured the first 4 seasons, and can't wait to complete the journey...and then start over again. It is THAT GOOD!

It will be great to re-watch the entire run of the show, because the dialogue is often quick and poignant, and it really is a challenge to pick up on everything said on the first go-round. Also, what attention to detail set-wise and situation-wise...authenticity abounds! Why not? Dee Dee Myers being a consultant for the production, and all. If a former White House Press Secretary doesn't know the score, who does?!

This show has a truly ""blast cast""...and the character development, sometimes via flashbacks, is so rich. It is the acting and interacting of the stars that make this show go. Get to know these people at the West Wing stage...their strengths, as well as their vulnerabilities. If Martin Sheen isn't our absolute greatest all-time actor, he's in the top few! He IS President Bartlet! John Spencer as Leo....Awesome! Tobey, Josh, Charlie, Donna, Margaret, Sam, etc., etc.. Stockard Channing makes a great First-Lady, and the ""occasional players"" each bring their own magic to the episodes where they are featured.

There is little I can say that hasn't been said before about this masterful body of work. It's intelligent, clever, touching, humorous, poignant....brilliant! The actors are superb across the board, and the writing/acting are so carefully ""character-consistent"". Completely convincing that the roles they portray are NOT roles, but the actual people involved. That's the truest mark of GREAT acting.

While this review is technically positioned as describing the First Season, it really applies to the first 4 seasons I have seen thus far(and very very likely the entire run of the show). Great ""extra"" features (though not too many)...and consistently sensational episodes. I would say that Season I is probably my favorite...but they are all gems. Not a single episode was ""phoned in"".

I have noticed a few ""glitches"" in the discs...I think one episode had a moment when the picture ""froze"" momentarily, and on the Sony Blu-Ray player I have the ""prequels"" to the episodes at hand...""previously on ""The West Wing""...tend to be shown in a condensed screen image....recovering to ""full size"" image when the actual episode starts. Kind of strange, and I don't know if that's an oddity of my player or done intentionally(or accidentally) by the producers of the DVD's. The sound is awesome, the picture quality great (on the first 4 seasons which I've viewed). I've read other reviews commenting on disc ""issues""/""glitches"". Speaking only for my own experience, and the individual seasons I have purchased and enjoyed, I'd say the technical difficulties have been few...and a small inconvenience for the thrills of this landmark television experience!

1465172,5,B00005JLF3,"`The West Wing: Season One' is a political TV series that is made with intelligence, humour and gripping storylines. Following a Democrat president and his team of senior staff, this series explores various issues of American politics and world affairs. You don't need to know a great deal about politics to enjoy this show as there is a strong human element to the stories, but some background knowledge would only serve to heighten your enjoyment. This covers events such as the making of and controversy surrounding gun laws, privacy laws, the death sentence, reaction to terrorists and a conflict between India and Pakistan and that is just in the first half of the series! This is fast paced and intelligent and you need to keep your attention on the events on-screen or you can quickly become lost in the story, but this is a positive element in my view. This isn't dumbed down and the audience is treated with respect throughout. Although this is stylised, it does give some idea of what life must be like in the halls of high level political decision making and it makes for fascinating and gripping viewing. Once you buy this you will want to get the rest of the series' and keep watching the various stories unfold, especially after the end of series cliff hanger.

1465215,5,B00005JLF3,"They might learn something. Maybe. Look, I'm a situational drama junkie--I have to confess that right away. Cop shows, Doc shows, lawyer shows--I'm on board for the first season, unless and until seeing a few episodes shows me I have better things to do with that hour. I didn't know beans about Aaron Sorkin--his name didn't resonate with me like those of Dick Wolf, Jerry Bruckheimer, Stephen Cannell. But what I was hearing about this one intrigued me. Back in 1999 I wasn't under the constant onslaught from people I know of anti-gov rhetoric which back then was still pretty much the province of militia gun nuts. And the more this ""neo-anarchism"" grew, the more defiant I got. I was supposed to watch mean-spirited sitcoms instead? And I got nowhere (and still don't today) when I said to Washington-bashing friends; ""You guys are talking about our own capitol the way people did 20 years ago about the Kremlin."" So I tuned in to this series, and when it started bagging Emmys I wasn't surprised. You get dynamite characters like Rob Lowe's Sam Seaborn, Bradley Whitford's Josh Lyman, John Spencer's Leo McGarry, Richard Schiff's Toby Zeigler, a really likable girl-next-door type like Donna Moss played by Janel Moloney, who I later found out was the woman who as a kid had played Tiny Tim's big sister Belinda on a version of ""Christmas Carol"". And avuncular Martin Sheen was cast to type as a less-sexy New England version of Bill Clinton. And as the series progressed, we saw the President Of the United States, played by the guy with the biggest matinee name, as a supporting player. It was instead like the title suggests--about the lives of those who work in the White House, down to the grandmotherly presidential receptionist. In 1999 I was becoming a disafected Democrat, who later registered as a moderate Nelson Rockefeller/ Jerry Ford Republican. And you know, I never did tune in to boo at the bleepin' Democrats the way some people do with Stone Cold Steve Austin.

1465306,3,B00005JLF3,"Season one of The West Wing opens part way through the first year of the Bartlet Administration.  President Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen) is a first term Democrat from New England, and he has a strong staff helping him.  That is, when they aren't caught up in personal issues.  For instance, Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn's (Rob Lowe) new friend happens to be a prostitute.  Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer) is having problems in his marriage.  And Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford) is upset that they have hired former girlfriend Mandy Hampton (Moira Kelly) as a political consultant.  Never mind the fact that she is the best in the business.

But along with the personal drama, there are also plenty of politics as The White House seeks to get various bills through Congress, or even a Supreme Court Nominee.  Fortunately, CJ Cregg (Allison Janney) is on hand to properly deal with the press during all the ups and downs of the first year.

I know this show was popular when it aired, but I never even tried to get into it.  In fact, I only watched this season because my best friend passed it on to me.  The pilot confirmed my worst fears as conservative Christians come out of that looking like complete hypocrites.  But I pressed on.  Even from there, the show was a mixed bag.

I must admit, I have grown to love these characters, especially President Bartlet.  The one exception is Mandy, who is just too sanctimonious for her own good.  On the other hand, the conversations that Josh has with his assistant, Donna Moss (Janel Moloney), are often the highlights of the episodes for me.  While the show does present a liberal agenda very favorably, it does begin to have a more balanced portrayal of conservatives as it goes along.

However, the storytelling is very weak.  This is most noticeable in the first few episodes.  We are just dumped into a story and not really told who any of the players are.  I had to look them all up myself.  Multiple episodes are completely predictable, and not just because of a formula but because of cliches used too many times before elsewhere.  Several of the episodes are more a chance to preach to us then entertain us.  And some of the best potential storylines of the season are abbreviated for no reason I could find.

And, of course, the show is always praised for its writing.  Yes, it is fast paced, but I also found it too smug.  And the walk and talks?  Seriously, I was about ready to tell the characters to stand still several times.

Despite the weaknesses, I must admit, I need to know what happened next.  I am looking for ways to continue the series cheaply.

I didn't find this season to be as wonderful as everyone else, but there is still some entertainment value here.  I'm probably alone in this assessment, but you might want to catch some reruns before you buy this set.",1236643200,5,2876,4.611439842209073

Most of all, don't we want to be able to have faith in the people who have the power to get done the things for which government is responsible and know that our faith will not go unrewarded?

The West Wing's characters portray all of the above qualities, and more! Really great writing and fabulous acting combine to create characters that are as real as the people playing them, right out of the starting gate. Like characters in your favourite novels, you don't want the season to end; but alas all good things, eventually, do.... (Thank goodness for season number two.)

As far as the DVDs specifically -- one thing that I like, that some hour-long dramas don't include when reproduced on DVDs is the ""previously on. . . "" part before the episode starts.  This series does have that, and you sometimes need it to get caught up, since one obviously doesn't watch ALL of the 30 episodes at once.

The DVD packaging is rather good for a show. The discs are double sided, but episodes are not presented in widescreen. Inside is a booklet containing episode descriptions and a list of characters. On the flaps are lists of awards the show received in its first season as well as a list of special features.

This show is one of the best pieces of television ever created. Not only does the fast pace of the show, and complex story lines, intertwining of characters lend itself to quick,and meaningful character development, but the shows many political topics are unraveled with provocation and eloquence.

This show is a MUST see! It's intelligent, beyond any other show that I've recently seen, and the breadth and depth of topic examination remains relevant for our society today. The characters appeal to a broad audience, but each has his/her own eccentricities that makes the show interesting, and emotional.

From another angle, I've learned a significant amount about the ""behind the scenes"" political negotiation process, and the level of issue examination makes this a great conversation starter, and catalyst in really thinking about tough and fascinating issues, facing not just the US, but the world.

The first few seasons and the last two seasons are the best. There are a good deal of special features and this season was amazing.

I have all of the seasons. I received them all from Amazon (most were Christmas gifts).

4 of the sets had defective disks. There would be at least one episode that you could not play without it skipping. Please make sure you watch the episodes completely within the 30 return period to be sure that there are no defective disks. Amazon is very good about replacing the set if there are defects but there is a time limit. It is hard to get through 20+ hours of tv watching in 30 days!

Also- Sets 1-3 (and maybe 4) have programming on both sides of the disks. Seasons 1 & 2 are my favorites and have been watched many times. Over time the disks seem to ""split"" in the center and skipping occurs now throughout the programming. There are no scratches on the disks and the skipping is inconsistant (always happens on the disks now, but not always in the same place).

This issue does not seem to occur with the later sets (programming only on one side). There is no way to replace the disks once this starts happening. If you have a way to ""backup"" the first few sets I would recommend it if you plan to watch them often. Not an issue if you are only likely to watch them once.",1209427200,7,1308,4.326530612244898

The show picks up about a year into the Bartlett Presidency, and this season ender is the kind of shocker that leads nicely into season 2.  I liked the West Wing on NBC, and I bought season one because of the episode In Excelis Deo.  This episode is, in my opinion, the best one ever made.  I got sucked into the lives of Josh and Donna, Leo, and Sam Seaborn.  The end of every West Wing season is a cliffhanger leading into the next.  Before I knew what was happening, I owned all 7 seasons.

I don't really have much of a life, so once I had all 7 seasons, I took a vacation from work, and marathoned all 7 seasons.  I don't recommend doing that, but it was cheaper than driving somewhere, and more entertaining than my relatives.  Check out season one.  Put it in your Netflix cue, or whatever.

1465437,5,B00005JLF3,"I was never really interested in watching this show. I often saw it playing on TV while I was living in Toronto, Canada, but was never captivated to sit indoors and watch it (I spend most of my spare time in outdoor activities).

Then one day Bush junior took office. Then came September 11, then the US invasion of Afghanistan, followed by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Then Moore's Fahrenheit 911 hit the screens to become a box office hit. Then came Bush's second term, which I did not expect he'd win, followed by the lowest approval ratings in US history. Iraq was a disaster; Afghanistan was becoming another problem as the Taliban regrouped and regained strength; and Bin Laden was still evading capture.

Suddenly I found myself interested in American politics. I wanted to know more about what goes on behind the scenes. What makes a US President popular? How are decisions taken? Does the President act on his own or as a team? Can the President sleep at night when US troops and innocent civilians are dying? How does the secret Service protect the President? My questions could fill several pages. I could easily have gone on the internet and typed each question on Google. Better still, I could have gone to the Library, a trip few of us take today with the advent of the internet. But I decided to watch Season 1 of the West Wing, and am I glad I did.

The West Wing will give you an inside look at the American Presidency. You will really learn a lot about American politics. Did you know, for example, that the American Eagle holds thirteen arrows in the left talon and an olive branch in the right talon? When at peace, the Eagle faces the olive branch. When at war, the Eagle faces the arrows. In the halls of Congress the carpets are actually changed to reflect this.

Did you know that the Secret Service is aware at all times of the location of the President, even while he is in the White House? A Secret Service agent radios the Central Command when the President enters the Oval Office and when he leaves it. A Secret Service agent is practically positioned at every door in the White House, radioing where the President is at all times. There is little privacy for the President in the White House. Maybe being the President of the US is not as glamorous as we all think if one has to forego his privacy and freedom.

Every word the President utters must be well thought off, and the consequences of the words calculated ahead of time by his team. A US President goes through rehearsals before giving speeches and before standing in front of journalists. He is always surrounded by a team of experts advising him of how he should answer questions, and which questions should not be answered. One wrong word could mean a slide in approval ratings.

The Secret Service also protects the President's family. Could you imagine an unfriendly country kidnapping the President's daughter? What would the President do in such a case? Would he make the wrong decisions in order to save his daughter? Would his daughter come first, or the country? Would the President be relieved of his duties in such a situation as not to compromise US security? This series will answer a lot of these questions.

This series will also show you the relationship between the President and his staff. The Vice-President is not necessarily always on the President's side, and he often has his own agenda. Sometimes he would act to his own benefit in order to gain popularity for a possible run at the Presidency. Politics can be a dirty business, and a very selfish one.

I enjoyed learning about the press core in the White House, and how they retrieve news. I now watch CNN in a new light.

The characters in this series are well thought off, very believable, and likable. There is one character I did not particularly like, and I think he was later replaced in other Seasons. Martin Sheen plays the President, and I don't think anyone could have played the part better.

This series is exciting, with many twists. The series ends with an attempted murder at the US President and his daughter, and someone is shot, but we don't know who. You'd have to watch Series 2 to find out.

If you've always wanted to learn more about the US Presidency and US politics in general, this series will be a great start.  Get your notebook out and join US Presidency 101! You are going to enjoy this course.",1193529600,2,4394,4.576335877862595

1465439,3,B00005JLF3,"I was torn between giving this 2 or 3 stars.  I decided to give it three because it is better than so much of what has been on the main corporate media.  I also am an opponent of the militarist and exclusionary ""Christianity"" of the right-wing and share other political sentiments of the show.  Having said that, this characterization of the West Wing glorifies an executive branch (liberal and conservative administrations) that is thoroughly corrupted by big money.  This series gets liberal points for arguing for gun control and that sort of issue, but when it comes to the issues the Clinton administration was quite reactionary on - ""free"" trade deals like NAFTA, the war on non-corporate drugs, the demonization of Arabs who our empire has been targeting for generations, welfare ""reform,"" boosts in corporate welfare and privatization schemes - the show is really quiet on those issues.  Very quiet on important issues, and very heavy on the sappy patriotic music and constantly putting a portrait of Teddy Roosevelt or a bust of some other founder on the screen.
I don't like that term ""founding fathers,"" on top of diminishing the role of women and the general public, it's a slap in the face to the indigenous people, and the slaves and the migrant & native workers who truly built the country.

Given the girth of tiresome reality shows and the straining, over-the-top ploys of hospital and other ""dramas,"" its a good thing that the first season of ""The West Wing"" is preserved on DVD for those times when whatever is on the tube disappoints.

The season begins with an introduction of the various senior members of the White House staff, who help President Bartlett (Martin Sheen) with his job of leading the country. It continues with a focus on the staff and all the work that they put into running the country before things even get to the President, while offering plenty of glimpses into the charismatic and good-hearted President as he tackles the unique joys and responsibilities that come with the most important job in the world. We get a glimpse of Washington Politics and the extraordinary-yet-everyday people fighting the good fight to help make the country better.

This first season of ""The West Wing"" has it all - witty dialogue, moving and suspenseful story lines, and superlative acting and direction. From the introduction of the President in the first episode to the cliff-hanging ending, you won't be disappointed with a single of the twenty-one episodes in the first season. In addition to its pure entertainment value, its hard to watch ""The West Wing"" without becoming excited about American politics and our potential for great leaders, if only for an hour at a time. Easily 4.5 stars out of 5, with certain episodes worthy of the highest rating (""Mr. Willis of Ohio"" and ""In Excelsis Deo"" in particular).",1181779200,2,1598,4.9812734082397006

I caught a 1st season episode on Bravo one weekend (the show had probably been on the air for several seasons at that point), and I was hooked instantly. It's so smart and informative. And whether or not you're a Democrat or a Repulican etc, they make valid arguments for each political party. My favorite characters are Sam, Josh, and Toby. Although they can be arrogant at times, they're such good guys overall. I fell in love with all three of them. Anyway, my favorite episode of the entire series is in this first season--Celestial Navigation. It's so funny how badly Josh mucks things up the one time he takes over for C.J. during a press briefing.

1465517,5,B00005JLF3,"OK, let me start this out with some personal information. I'm a generally conservative Republican. The conservatism is more economic and financial than it is moral (I tend to be more libertarian on social issues). So, when it comes to the political aspect of things, I like the West Wing (which I at times sarcastically referred to as the Left Wing) more in spite of the politics than because of them.

Having said that, the series is wonderfully written. The dialog is sparkling, the plot twists are at times wonderful, amusing, and fun. The characters are well-drawn, intelligent, and the whole thing is as good as television's ever gotten. The series deals with various issues that the creative minds are interested in, and they make those issues interesting and present both sides of things more than you would expect. Though the writers usually take the liberal position, they're actually honest enough to present the opposite side of each of the arguments, and let the issues be argued back and forth. The episodes often don't resolve things, completely or at all. After the middle of the season the president gets more successful, though the assassination attempt at the end of the first season sidetracks the characters somewhat.

I enjoyed this series a great deal, and this first season has some of its best moments. I would recommend the whole thing to anyone interested in politics, or well-written television.",1173744000,3,1422,4.9957805907173

1465525,5,B00005JLF3,"1997. Penn State University. Michael Hauge was holding a seminar there on ""How to Write Screenplays that Sell."" I was about one year out of high school and really interested in the prospects of a screenwriting career.

For anybody who attends any sort of seminar, there is usually a certain film, script or work that an instructor uses to demonstrate the points of a successful story and/ or film. The script Michael Hauge had chosen was ""The American President,"" written by Aaron Sorkin.

I had no idea at the time of the calibur of storytelling I had in my instruction manual. I knew I liked the movie, but I didn't know why until the seminar had concluded and the film had been dissected to its core. I went on to learn that Aaron Sorkin had also written ""A Few Good Men.""

Those two screenplays alone are an education, brilliantly crafted, riveting in both plot and in the dilemmas and conflict of character, but the stamp of Aaron Sorkin's style comes in his use of dialogue. There are few other writers capable of crafting the intelligence, heart and wit that gets fired out of the mouths of Hollywood's most gifted actors.

West Wing provides time to focus on issues, life and love in a way no feature film can and each season leaves you wanting more. Aaron Sorkin was able to take one simple idea of a behind the scenes look at Senior Staffers in the White House and turn it into an extraordinary hour of television year after year. Due credit should be given to John Wells, Tommy Schlamme and other contributors who helped make the West Wing come alive and to the actors for giving those people heart as well as wicked tongues. So, in conclusion, the West Wing provides entertainment as well as an education whether you are a democrat or republican - an aspiring writer or director or maybe just someone in the mood for a well told tale.",1158624000,3,1846,4.551204819277109

1465600,5,B00005JLF3,"Lots of people like to intone the words of A. Lincoln by calling on our ""better angels"" to bestow upon us wisdom, compassion and strength.  Rarely does one find an entertainment vehicle that consistently aims for those exact angels.

The West Wing is a wonderful, complex and daring series that creates complicated, flawed characters placed in equally complicated and flawed circumstances.  Aside from some over-the-top preachiness from Richard Shiff (Toby Zeigler)and long-winded, wonkish monologues by Alison Janney (C.J. Craig), the show takes great strides to avoid patently obvious conscience-raising lectures and polemics designed to shove liberal dogma down the throats of the great unwashed.

It is true that religion and conservativism take a bit of a bashing from time to time.  However, a philosophy or faith that cannot withstand scrutiny is hardly worth the effort.  As a Christian, I usually draw strength from the criticisms leveled against people of faith in this show.  The points they raise force me to take a long, hard look at what I actually believe.

The characters, all interesting archetypes we see reflected through the media, move through a set specifically designed to give the viewer the effect of following them around the most powerful building in the free world.  The dialogue is crisp and the pace of movement is spectacular.  Conflicts are rarely resolved in the usual manner.  Oftentimes, characters that are warring will remain at odds with each other at the end of the episode.  Martin Sheen (Jed Bartlett), in particular, is a fantastic realization.  He is taciturn, contrary, arrogant and pious.  He is neither always right or always wrong.  I love how his character is portayed.  So much power in the hands of one person can be daunting and this weight is used to the writers' advantage.

More than enough has been said about this show.  It's a singular event in TV in that it offers contemporary stories dealing with issues we can all understand without forcing contrived resolutions or dream-like, deus-ex-machina endings that make no sense in the real world.

Watching the character, Toby Ziegler get caught up in a funeral for a homeless ex-marine veteran of the Korean Conflict was poignant and thrilling. Add the character of Mrs. Landingham and her story of what happened to her many Christmas Eves ago, and you have a classic. It reveals how you would like our government to treat and support, and I mean really support the veterans of our conflicts that is so sadly missing today.

As usual, ""The West Wing"" knows how to deliver a Christmas episode with a message of peace and caring for others who are simply our fellow Americans. No one sought to find out the dead marine's politics or beliefs. He was just accorded the honor that should be given to all our veterans. And this was just one episode.

Being more of a music than a film person, I'm saddened by the increasing use of ""compression"" (in the audio engineer's sense--I don't mean JPEG or MP3 compression) in music.  It makes CDs sound better in car stereos and on portable players.  But for listening on a good hi-fi at home, much of the music's drama is lost if there isn't much difference between the quietest and the loudest passages.

One of my favorite things about West Wing has been that it's unusually cinematic for a television series.  It isn't bright and day-glo.  Unlike most TV shows, which more and more seem to be converging with the techniques of television advertisements.

So, yes:  great cinematography.  But it was Sorkin's scripting which was crucial.  His ability to weave multiple subplots both within a show and from show-to-show remains unmatched by any other writer for television.  Some may object that what I've described is merely the ""soap opera"" formula:  but what soap opera ever had this kind of substance or emotional impact?

[SPOILER alert -- covering the next two paragraphs]

Think of the show where Josh is on stage narrating ""a day in the life"" at the White House:  the time he filled in at a press conference after C.J. had an emergency root canal and could barely speak.  Josh jokingly told the press corps that the President had a ""secret"" plan to fight inflation, and the reporters all take him seriously!  His verbal performance is cut in not only with shots from that past fiasco -- but also merges with the developing story -- which Josh follows via his cell phone, occasionally interrupting his talk -- that story taking place in parallel, in the present, where a teetotaling Supreme Court nominee is arrested on a groundless DWI charge, which was in fact the crime of ""driving-while-Hispanic"" in what must have been a very-white Connecticut town.

If only the judge had followed through with his initial intention to stay in prison, not only so that he can see the justice system from the other side, but presumably also develop a better cause of action to sue the racist cops who arrested him.  Yes, the plot might have slowed down too much...but what a spectacle it would have been.

[OK, this is where you can start reading again, if you didn't want to hear too much]

Most television producers imagine the audience can't possibly keep track of so many characters and plotlines.  Especially not timelines!  The success of West Wing has proven them s-o-o-o wrong.

I suppose it's too much to ask.  To expect that kind of brilliant writing to appear on TV again.

But we can always watch the Sorkin seasons on DVD.  Even on widescreen, although that wasn't done until Season Two.",1133395200,5,2822,4.7412731006160165

From the witty and sarcastic  one-liners to the character driven stories, the show always delivers. It created a tapestry of characters that are individually and collectively engaging.

Here are my personal top 5 favorite episodes of the season:

1. In Excelsis Deo - A great episode that has a very positively Christmas feel. The White House staff had to deal with different things, CJ with her position on hate crimes, Sam and Josh protecting Leo from the drug scandal, Toby inexplicably affected by the death of a homeless man. Ironically only the president seems to be in the Christmas mood with his holiday shopping. The episode ended with a great montage with the white house staff all lined up while listening to the Christmas carol and then the funeral of the dead homeless man.

2. Let Bartlet Be Bartlet - A great ensemble episode that showcased the unity and loyalty of the staff to the administration of Bartlett. It's a poignant episode that strengthens the viewers attachment and involvement to the characters. You root for them and you want them to succeed.

3. Celestial Navigation - I love this episode. Probably the funniest episode of the season. There's so many great scenes like Josh being hounded in the press room, Sam and Toby in the prison, and CJ with the root canal. Nice use of flashbacks.

4. What Kind of Day Has it Been? - I love this kind of style of storytelling. The episode opened with the last 5 minutes of the episode where nothing makes sense because we have no idea what happened prior to the scene. The opening scene ended with a cliffhanger. Then we get to see things that happened before the opening scene. I often see that kind of storytelling style in Alias, and I really like it. The last few minutes of the episode were suspenseful. A great season ender.

5. Pilot - A solid series premiere that established the mood of the show as well as introducing the White House staff.

1465674,5,B00005JLF3,"It has now become television legend that when the creator of The West Wing, Aaron Sorkin, pitched his idea about a show concerning American politics to the executives, he was almost laughed out of their offices. Absolutely no average American TV viewer would have an interest or the intellectual capacity to appreciate a series that expounds on political policy and the political machinations behind the scenes in the nation's capitol. A show about the president? Please, the American people have had enough ""real life"" drama during the impeachment of president Clinton concerning his deceptions about his sexual exploits in the oval office. Well, these savvy television executives were dead wrong. At the end of its first season, The West Wing won more awards and was the most watched debut television series in memorable history, continuing to produce many more seasons.

This series set a new benchmark for television drama. All said and done, however, this wonderful series is not about ""real"" American politics and their politicians; The West Wing is about how we would want our politicians to be - smart, ethical and human. This show is about wish fulfilment. President Bartlet may not be everyone's idea of a perfect president, but he certainly comes close. He is a Noble Prize winning economist and a politician with a family tradition that extends back the signing of the Declaration of Independence. He is ""presidential"", commanding respect, and is much too honest for his own good. Bartlet has surrounded himself with an exceedingly intelligent and loyal staff. These people bleed for him every day and would certainly die for the man. But the entire cast is strong, each character unique, contributing to the magical mix that makes this show so dynamic and personal to the audience.

The first season hits the ground running building momentum until its final episode, leaving the audience hanging and chomping at the bit for more.

Aaron Sorkin is an exceptionally talented writer and informed about world affairs, issues and American politics in general. I was astounded at one episode where two characters are discussing civil rights and possible monetary reparations for the great grandchildren of African American slaves. The amount worked out to be in the trillions of dollars. This discussion was simply an education and opened my eyes to this issue. Sorkin is a first class writer with a scary talent.

The West Wing Season 1 includes 22 episodes with extras of interviews with the crew and cast. If you are a fan of this show, having these DVD's at your disposal is a treat and well worth the investment.",1121126400,5,2624,5.039170506912442
1465675,5,B00005JLF3,"Premiering in September 1999, the original NBC series West Wing built an instant cult following with its seemingly realistic weekly excursions into the inner sanctums of the White House. The series became such a hit that some pollsters claimed that certain people actually believed Jed Bartlet was the real president (although, if true, this is more of a negative reflection on the intelligence of the electorate, and not necessarily an indication of West Wing's realism). But regardless, the truth of the matter is that West Wing definitely strikes a chord with certain audiences, providing entertaining brew of action, suspense, and drama on a weekly basis...

Seasoned Hollywood actor Martin Sheen plays the lead role of President Jed Bartlet. The day-to-day affairs of Bartlet's administration are run by a number of individuals who surround him, among them are: Claudia ""C.J."" Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), Leo McGarry (John Spencer), and Charlie Young (Dule Hill). West Wing follows these dedicated staffers as they work extended hours behind-the-scenes to help keep the White House running smoothly. Along the way, the stress of the job and the characters' personal lives make for an interesting glimpse into what many believe is an accurate portrayal of a real-life White House administration...

The West Wing (Season 1) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the series premiere in which we meet each of the recurring characters for the first time. The White House has their daily routine interrupted when President Bartlet falls off his bike, and Sam realizes the girl he picked in a bar the previous evening was a high-priced prostitute. Meanwhile, several members of the administration become embroiled in an ongoing feud with the ""religious right,"" prompting President Bartlet to personally condemn a group of fundamentalists known as ""The Lambs of God""... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Crackpots and These Women"" in which administration staffers spend their day listening to a number of crackpot, single-issue groups lobbying for federal favors, and ""Take This Sabbath Day"" in which President Bartlet grapples with the decision to commute the death sentence of a convicted killer following a Supreme Court ruling upholding his sentence...

1465676,5,B00005JLF3,My dad has been watching the show from the begining. I was very young when i started watching at the beginging of season 2. Even at a young age I appreciated the shows brilliant writting. When we got the first season on dvd for Christmas i was imediatly  sucked in. I loved every aspect of the show. I love the humor and the fast paced dialoge which as somehow been lost in the more recent seasons. Watching all of the first season on dvd made me  feel sad that this once brilliantly written show has become what it is now.,1110844800,6,523,4.22
1465677,5,B00005JLF3,"The West Wing is a show so delicious to watch - it is difficult to imagine that there are 22 feature films made in any given year that are as well-done and entertaining to watch.

It's wonderful to watch these episodes with a digital transfer and no commercials - my wife and I feel spoiled.  After watching a few hours of ""West Wing"" it feels like a real step-down to watch other network television, and it's the RARE movie that is as entertaining, thought-provoking and heart-warming.

The characters in this show seem very real, and even better, they seem very fundamentally ""good"" and concerned about each other, the country and their fellow man.  Time and again the characters take a step out of ""the usual"", but never with the intention of benefitting themselves.  Although this White House is democratic, you get a sense that they consider ""all sides"".  Every so often an event happens where various characters have the opportunity to ""do the right thing"" versus ""look good"", and invariably they err on the side of ""doing the right thing"".

One of the great things about this show is that it presents and ""teaches"" some of the fundamental political debates in our country in a way that is much livelier than a dry textbook or lecture.  For example, when C.J. pulls aside Sam and admits she understands basically zilch about the national census, Sam gives her a quick ""Census 101"" that make it very clear to C.J. - but also makes it clear to the audience as well.  We get to hear political debate - and although the Bartlett White House is full of liberal democrats we usually get a pretty good look at the opposite side.  Example: Donna discovers that there is a budget surplus of over 30 billion in this first season (at about the same time that the Clinton administration unexpectedly discovered the same thing). Donna thinks the taxpayers should get a refund. Josh, her boss, explains to her that democrats have a much better plan for the surplus and it just wouldn't be a democratic party kind of ""thing"" (any event or idea is a thing to these characters.)

Opposing viewpoints are not ridiculed for the most part.  Although a fictional account who wouldn't feel comfortable with a team like this leading our country?

Accompanying the complete first 22 episodes is a disc of ""behind the scenes"" documentaries that make it clear that the genius behind the madness is writer/creator Aaron Sorkin.

Seldom does writing, directing, setting and acting come together so in a manner so completely satisfying.  Mr. Sorkin says in one of the included interviews that one of their goals is to make every episode as good as the best one.  Everyone has their ""favorites"" among the episodes - me too - but in this first season every one is excellent.",1110758400,8,2749,4.731656184486373
1465678,5,B00005JLF3,"First of all, I'm a political science/history major and I'll still be the first to admit that I was a bit sceptical of this series.  I just didn't think that they could make this show as interesting, informative, and especially funny as it ended up being.  After watching about the first disk of the series, I was hooked and it had become my favorite show.  The first season just blew my mind.  I've now watched the rest of them, and they haven't let up a bit.

This is anything but watching an hour of Capital Hill voting on CNN, though.  There's an incredible cast including Bradley Whitford, Allison Janney, Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe who take you into the show and the world of politics.  It's nowhere near stuffy; full of humor, love interests, and interesting information.  From the first frame of the episode, you'll be glued to the TV.  If you're interested in politics, or even if you're not, give this series a chance.  You won't be sorry you did.

Martin Sheen is my President.",1109894400,6,984,4.565714285714286
1465679,4,B00005JLF3,"The West Wing has deservedly won a number of Emmy awards over the past few years - to the actors and as best drama.  Compared to shows of similar popularity, only Law and Order and ER can consistently boast the same levels of performance.  But both of these shows are becoming stale - there are only so many ways to commit a crime and so many different patient problems to fix.  On the other hand, the West Wing can be about anything since the President and government of a country will be involved in all aspects of that country's affairs.

In the first season we cover some of the standard ground that a president is likely to cover.  We have a war between India and Pakistan (two countries that are putatively allies of the U.S.), selection and confirmation of a new supreme court judge, discussion on whether to pardon a man sentenced to death, a hurricane, a couple scandals, and the passage of various laws.  However, what happens is not so important as how it happens.  We get an inside look at wheeling-and-dealing between the parties in Congress (and between Congress and the White House), arguments between staffers on the best way to implement policy, and the agony of a president forced to order troops into harm's way.  It doesn't hurt that the dialogue is often very funny, the political arguments are impassioned, and the characters are lovable.

The pilot is the first show on the disc, and the characters are almost fully formed.  The feel of the show - quick cuts, walking-and talking, constant bustle in the background of scenes - give the show a hyperkinetic energy that is surprising if you consider that most of what happens is dialogue.  The employment of several former White House staffers give the show a feel of authenticity (it's no surprise that Allison Chaney's performance as press secretary C.J. is the lynchpin holding the show together, as Bill Clinton's press secretary is one of these consultants).

The first few episodes are a letdown compared to the pilot.  There are some growing pains and the show moves a little more slowly, which robs it of its momentum.  Likewise, characterisations sometimes go off-character (Sam the socialist and Josh the pragmatist seem to switch philosophies in one episode).  It's not really until Episode 9 (The Short List) that the series settles down and becomes regularly interesting every show.  A second early problem is that the writers weren't always sure what to do with its female cast - the First Lady, Mandy the spin doctor, and some of the female guest stars are not well-written or interesting characters.  This also irons itself out by having C.J. and Donna rise in prominence while dropping Mandi after this season.

The show itself is worth having on DVD, because it is a single continuing storyline and it gives you new appreciation to see the shows close together.  That's good, because the DVD extras are not very interesting or useful.  The possibilities for extras on a show like this are endless - why not a commentary by a retired judge on the process of appointing a judge?  Why not an article comparing the Clinton White House to the one in the show?  Why not a Republican commentator to offer an alternative policy point of view to the Left-leaning Democratic president of the show?  Why not poli-sci profs or ex-Congressmen talking about the political process?  No, instead we get multiple narcissistic featurettes and commentaries on designing the style of the show, on how wonderful creators Sorkin and Schlamme are, and how much fun it is for the actors.  One such featurette was fun.  4 of them, along with 3 commentaries, was tedious.  That said, it was nice to see some cut scenes and to put a face to some of the behind-the-scenes people (especially the creators and the composer).",1107388800,10,3783,4.797839506172839
1465680,5,B00005JLF3,"The first season of West Wing shows us how good television can be. If you've seen the movie The American President, the look, feel, and sound of West Wing will seem familiar to you, because Aaron Sorkin also wrote the screenplay for the movie.

The focus for the West Wing is mostly on the staff, though, and that's what makes the show so interesting. The character development is absolutely superb-- you care about the characters, so you care about the storyline. In addition, the writing is so clever, and you will find yourself busting out with belly laughs at points.

If you have missed the first two or three seasons, and have only seen it in the last couple of years, you may be extremely underwhelmed and not see what all the fuss was about. The first season will answer that question for you. You can now catch reruns on Bravo and sometimes in syndication, but it can be hard to jump in in the middle without knowing who everyone is and what they do. This set gives you the perfect opportunity to see it from the very beginning.",1105401600,3,1037,4.481481481481482
1465681,5,B00005JLF3,"West Wing is my all-time favorite TV show, so I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed this collection.  I was pleasantly surprised by just how good it was.  After Aaron Sorkin left the show it seldom came close to the quality of the first few seasons.  The writing, acting, lighting and attention to detail made this show great.  Watching the first season after the first post-Sorkin season was quite a shock.  The difference in quality made it seem like a completely different show.

This collection also has some great extras.  There are interviews with cast and crew and some outtakes, but the best are the episodes with commentary from Sorkin, Tommy Schlamme and some of the other directors.  Any fan of the show will enjoy this stuff.  They talk about a lot of the little things, like the goldfish bowl on C.J.'s desk, which always has something in the bottom that is related to that particular show.  The viewer normally can't even see it, but they did this to ammuse themselves.

This is what TV should be.",1098144000,3,1007,4.6647727272727275
1465752,5,B00005JLF3,"I hate politics and avoid the news... but I LOVE this show.  These characters portray the noble people we wish our elected officals were. The show brings up complicated and sometimes emotional issues, often voicing both sides of it, and reveals the real life challenge of actually passing lesislation or providing political asylum or taking military action.  It shows the 24 hour nature of the Presidency, the personal challenges of a person and his family in that role, how he depends upon good advisors, and the myriad of ways that a good intention from someone in power can be thwarted by another or exchanged for a greater good.

Another appealing aspect is the way that the characters are developed... they are likeable, have flaws, have histories and their relationships with each other interesting.  It's tv for the head and heart.  The education is presented in a very palatable manner and the emotional content is almost never sappy.",1093478400,8,942,4.974522292993631
1465753,5,B00005JLF3,"If you don't own it yet, I highly suggest buying it.  I got into West Wing around the start of season three and have been watching it with dedication since then.  But through it all, my favorite episode is from Season One, ""In Excelsis Deo"" in which the episode mostly focuses on Toby, the humble giant, who deals with some issues.  The finishing scene, with the music playing perfectly along with the gun salute at the funeral.

Buy it, you will not regret it.",1093305600,5,461,4.4523809523809526
1465754,5,B00005JLF3,"Best television drama ever produced in my opinion. Extremely engaging dialog, wonderful plot development/execution, believable characters. After watching the full first season in it's entirety, it's difficult to watch the ""real"" political world. This show is a testament that quality writing still exists.

1465755,5,B00005JLF3,"The West Wing is one of the only shows worth watching on TV these days.  Unfortunately, our citizens have become politically apathetic, and seem to be criminally ignorant of how our country's government works.  And, while possibly not a 100% accurate, The West Wing is about as close as you are going to get to a real look at the goings-on inside Washington and, more importantly, inside the White House.  What is unique about this show, is that, although it takes place (mostly) inside The White House, it does NOT focus on the President.  Instead, it goes beyond any other attempt at political fiction, and focuses on the actions of the hard-working, and under-appreciated staffers that support the President and carry out his orders.  This show has everything... romance, political drama, suspense, humor, fast paced dialog, and most importantly, deep, intelligent, and easy-to-like characters.  Buy this for your collection and be sure to watch the hit on NBC!",1091145600,2,964,5.069620253164557

Finally, I learn something new about government, or people, or the world at large every episode. Makes you feel better about watching all that tv.",1089158400,,464,4.224719101123595

And, I have seen a lot of movies. One of the few movies that I agree with the critics on.
Warning: Be carefull, if you buy it or rent it you will be hooked. Very difficult not to start watching the next episode when the previous one ends.
The series deals with many current issues and shows us how the people behind the politics really try to do their best (in most cases).  Not that this is real life, mind you. But could sure serve as an inspiration to those that serve as our elected officials and those that aspire to serve in that capacity in the future.
What else can I say. Buy a copy, rent a copy but you just have to see this series. Then let us all know what you think.

1465758,5,B00005JLF3,"This series is, of course, the best on TV. I can't add anything to the praises in other reviews, but I will repeat that the writing and camera work are without equal. That said, I need to correct some misunderstandings.  Comparing it to the Simpsons, as one reviewer did, is silly; it's like comparing Robin Williams's standup routines to Kenneth Brannagh's Henry V. Both are brilliant, but they're entirely different creations, and are incomparable. Second, calling for a widescreen release of Season One is clear evidence of ignorance. Season One was shot for 1:33-1 showing; it was only in the second season that it was shot for widescreen. This collection is as it was meant to be seen. As for the extra (or lack thereof), with a show of this quality, extras are just that: extras. The show alone is worth the price.",1087689600,,820,4.734265734265734
1465759,5,B00005JLF3,"I, like many other people, am very glad Aaron Sorkin created ""The West Wing"". Seasons 1 through 4 of the series (written by Mr. Sorkin) represent, in my view, the best drama program on commercial television since ...... umm ...... give me a few months and I might be able to come up with something (but it won't be an easy assignment).

It would be extremely difficult indeed to come up with a TV series that had a rookie season as spectacular as ""The West Wing"". Each and every one of the 22 first-season episodes located on this 4-Disc DVD collection is truly memorable. Not a bad apple in the bunch, in my opinion -- which is remarkable for any series that was just getting its feet wet.

This tremendous batch of programs includes ""Five Votes Down"", ""Enemies"", ""In Excelsis Deo"", ""A Proportional Response"", and ""Let Bartlet Be Bartlet"". These episodes, and all the others in this 1999-2000 campaign, are so darn good, I felt like re-watching each one of them two minutes after viewing them via these DVDs.

The crafting of each episode is absolutely remarkable and worthy of high praise. The effort (and obvious care and precision) that goes into shooting just one scene is amazing. Take for instance one of the very first scenes ever filmed (for the Pilot; which is discussed by actor John Spencer in one of the very informative Making-Of documentary pieces contained on Disc 4 of this set) -- As Mr. Spencer explains in the featurette, the scene in question (one of those long, walking-the-White-House-corridors-while-talking-a-mile-a-minute type of scenes, a ""West Wing"" speciality) was originally written by Aaron Sorkin to be EIGHT different shots! But, instead, they filmed it as just ONE continuous ""hallway walking"" scene....and it's simply amazing.

The acting on ""The West Wing"" is equal to the excellent writing of Mr. Sorkin. Every character is drawn well and realized to their full potential by the great collection of actors and actresses that were assembled for this TV series. It's very difficult (I would imagine) for ANY ""West Wing"" fan to choose his or her ""favorite"" character on this show. They're ALL favorites. They're ALL that good.

We're not likely to see a TV program this well done for a long, long time. And it's a privilege now to be able to own these hall-of-fame-caliber shows on the DVD format.

These episodes look and sound just fine on DVD. Video is in the originally-aired television ratio of 1.33:1. (NOTE: Season Two's DVD set goes to Widescreen, even though that season, like this first season, was also originally shown in the Full-Frame (1.33:1) ratio. Season #2, however, WAS ""composed"" through the camera lens for EITHER a Full-Frame OR a Widescreen ratio presentation. And Season 2, just like #1, looks great on DVD.)

Sound comes from Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround tracks. Even though the shows are Full-Frame here, the Menus are anamorphic in nature.

A very nice bundle of Special Features is served up here, including Audio Commentaries for five episodes (in which Aaron Sorkin participates). Many other bonuses are located on Disc 4. Here's a look.....

....Two terrific behind-the-scenes Making-Of documentaries, entitled ""The Primaries"" (17 minutes long) and ""The Inauguration"" (29 minutes), which both give us interviews with many members of the cast and crew, including Mr. Sorkin and ""President Bartlet"" himself (Martin Sheen). Fabulous stuff here.

....Two other shorter featurettes are ""Capital Beat"" (8 minutes), which includes interviews with real-life political ""consultants"", who helped put a true-to-life political face on the series. And ""Sheet Music"" (6 minutes), which talks about the show's music.

....4 Deleted Scenes (total run time of just over 5 minutes). These scenes can be accessed individually, or played back-to-back via a ""Play All"" selection.

....""Gag Order"" -- A three-minute gag reel of bloopers and assorted oddball on-set happenings. There are a couple really funny screw-ups presented here. But this is way too short. It leaves you yearning for more. But -- it's fun while it lasts.

....""The West Wing Suite"" -- This is a montage of some scenes from Season 1 of ""The West Wing"", with appropriate musical accompaniment. But I'm not entirely sure what purpose this bonus is supposed to serve here. It's nice, I guess, as a kind of ""trailer"" for Season One. It has a running time of just under 2 minutes.

....""Off The Record"" -- This bonus segment (of 3.5 minutes duration) is a collection of outtakes from the four featurettes/documentaries on the DVD.

....Easter Egg -- There's a nifty little 2.5-minute ""Egg"" hidden on Disc 4 (the ""Special Features"" only disc). It highlights ""Manny: Head Of Security"", who is in charge of keeping people off the West Wing set when scenes are being filmed. This is a really fun Easter Egg, which also shows West Wing actor Richard Schiff having fun with ""Manny"" while riding around aimlessly on the studio lot in a golf cart-like vehicle. Kind of neat.

You access the ""Egg"" by hitting your remote's Left Arrow key followed immediately by the Right Arrow key from any of the eight Special Features Menu choices on Disc #4. After performing this ""Left then Right Arrow"" combination you'll see a ""Star"" come on the screen. Pressing ""Enter"" or ""Play"" with the star on the Menu screen will access the ""Manny"" Easter Egg.

Overall, it's a pretty satisfying batch of supplements offered up for this boxed set. But, in the end, this DVD collection would have been worth the price even if the 4th disc of bonus materials was excluded altogether. For it's the twenty-two magnificent episodes themselves that are truly the stars here.

But, as with his earlier series Sports Night, Aaron Sorkin again shows that he can write dialogue as good or better than anyone in television today.  The first season of The West Wing is cleverly crafted, fast moving, and politically idealistic.  One thing many people not familiar with this drama may not realize, the earlier episodes of The West Wing were funny.
The ensemble cast works great together from day 1 as if they'd been doing it for years.  Throughout season 1, you can see Rob Lowe in action at the time when he was considered a central character.  Of course in susequent years, Martin Sheen and others gradually took the spotlight which ultimately led to Lowe's departure.

The flow of the episodes is superb, especially without commercials!

The bonus features and commentaires are stellar (have you found the easter egg? I have). There are some similarities to ""The American President"" and one episode has the same title as a Sports Night episode, but all is forgiven because Sorkin really seems to have his finger on the pulse of DC.

Each of first season's 22 episodes are only 42 minutes commercial free minutes long and not one dog in the bunch! This show defines creative writing at its finest. It matters not what political persuasion you happen to be to enjoy this show for what it is, but for dramatic purposes the show's writers naturally had to pick a political party and run with it. So, like the proverbial coin toss, ""The West Wing"" happens to depict a fictional Democratic administration. Thanks to excellence in writing and acting, you may even learn some arcane details about our political process in a highly entertaining ways. The writers constantly challenge your intellect with amusing asides such as the President saying "" Four words in the English language begin with the letters dw. What are they?"" The rapid fire delivery of dialog by this superior ensemble cast is verbal poetry taking a brisk walk. This show is broadcast television striving hard to reach its finest potential. All the Emmys it has garnered speak for themselves. Highly recommended.",1076371200,24,1194,4.945273631840796
1465927,5,B00005JLF3,"I am a writer and, in my own opinion this is the only television show to achieve the level of perfection sought after by countless dramas, that end up adding up to nothing more than soap opera drivel.  Aaron Sorkin is the one writer on television worth admiring, I dare you to compare any of his scripts to the best of any other tv show, and then make an attempt to prove to me that Sorkin's isn't the only one you would want to see performed and brought to life.  Add to that, the best ensemble of actors in the history of commercial television and you have pure gold.  I don't agree with his (real-life) politics, however, Martin Sheen proves here that he is the only man who could pull off such a rich and distinct character.  While, Rob Lowe plays an idealist with a sense of absolute good, unseen on network television for being able to transform those ideals into being able to change and improve his country with what he sees and feels is right.  This succesful imaginative concept is breathtaking in its finished form.
  The season being aired now, season 5, is absolutely horrible, and it's not the actors fault.  Aaron Sorkin left the show after the fourth season, and now John Wells took over! Are you kidding me his pervious show, ER, is one of the dramas of soap opera drivel that I was reffering to earlier.  All of season 5's scripts are horrendous, and just downright sloppy.
  So stick to only getting seasons 1,2,3, and 4 on DVD.  And by the way season 2 was just announced for May 18th! and in widescreen nontheless.  However it'll be on only four discs like the 1st season, so that means that they'll be two sided again which i hate, i have a 300 disc dvd changer and what's the point of having a piece of tecnology like that, if you have to keep flipping the disc's to watch the next episode.

After some research I've confirmed that the first season of ""The West Wing"" was shot in 1.33:1 (full screen) aspect ratio and later seasons are in 1.78:1 (widescreen).
A 1.78:1 widescreen verison would need to be cropped from the original 1.33:1 full screen version and would lose part of the original image, something that viewers with multiple display formats offered by plasma screens can do already.  I recommend being happy with what we have - a faithful copy of the original program.
The West Wing is quite simply the best television that I have seen in a several decade of viewing across two continents. You could rent it, or borrow it from a friend, but you'll end up needing to order it anyway!",1072224000,3,854,4.842465753424658

Therefore, there is no reason for it to be in widescreen on the DVD.  In fact, if it wasn't shot in widescreen to begin with, it may not even be possible.
That said, ""The West Wing"" is simply one of, if not the most, intelligent shows on television.  It has a perfect blend of drama and comedy to make it believable.  In my opinion the best part of the show is the depth of the characters and how we really see many sides to them. None of them are caricatures of people we think would have their jobs.  You will learn something from every episode you watch, whether it's something about public policy, government structure, social issues, you name it.

1466081,5,B00005JLF3,"Watching the first season of ""The West Wing"" again from the perspective of fifth it is interesting to reconsider how the show began, especially now that creator Aaron Sorkin is gone.  When watching the pilot episode you have to remember that originally that President Jed Bartlett (Martin Sheen) was going to be a minor, recurring character, and that the series was really going to be about the staff in the West Wing: the authoritative Chief of Staff, Leo McGarry (John Spenser), the wunderkind Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), the cranky Communications Director Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), debonair Deupty Communications Director Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), and Press Secretary C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney).  However, getting Martin Sheen to play the President was just too good of an actor in too good of a role to ignore, and ""The West Wing"" became something else.
One of the best ways of noting how the series took off in a direction that was not originally anticipated would be to note how Public Relations Consultant Mandy Hampton (Moira Kelly) never became part of the family, while the role Donna Moss (Janel Moloney) became increasingly more significance, and she was added to the main cast for Season 2.  That was mainly because of her comic relationship with Josh Lyman, although I have to add that Marlee Matlin as Joey Lucas was a much better fit for the group as well.  Ironically, the Josh and Donna tag-team combined with the additon of Charlie Young (Dul Hill) as the personal aide to the President, derailed the idea that Josh was the son that Jed Barlette never had (the idea was to bring a person of color into the mix of the main cast).  The President refers to Josh as his son in the second season in his rant to God at the National Cathedral after the death of Mrs. Landingham (Kathryn Joosten), but clearly Charlie assumes that role, even without taking into account his dating Zoey Barlett (Elizabeth Moss).
All of this underscores the fact that the supporting cast is as good as the main roles.  Not only Donna and Mrs. Landingham that first season, but John Amos as Admiral Fitzwallace, Timothy Busfield as Danny Concannon, Roger Rees as Lord John Marbury, Tim Matheson as Vice President John Hoynes, and, of course, Stockard Channing as as First Lady Abbey Bartlet M.D.  That is without starting to check off the impressive list of guest stars like Karl Malden, Ken Howard, Edward James Olmos, and CHH Pounder.
The biggest flaw in the first season is the idea that the Vice President would be so out of the loop.  Even with the history lesson of the animosity that existed between JFK and LBJ, no New England intellectual elected to the White House is going to waste having a powerful former Senator from Texas in his administration.  Every since Jimmy Carter thoroughly vetted the cream of the Democratic party for his Vice President it has been an imperative that the spot be picked by somebody qualified to be president from day one, and other that Dan Quayle that has certainly been the case.  Gary Cole is a nice addition to the supporting cast, but Bartlett being 0 for 2 on Veeps is not a good thing.
That is why the idea this season that the Republicans would force some junior Congressman into the position is so offensive.  The key historical precedent would be the selection of Nelson Rockerfeller: qualified to be President and approved with the caveat this would be his final government job (i.e., he would not be on the ticket when Ford ran in 1976).  But if the show was intended to not be about the President but his staff, then the Vice President is a minor concern.  So it is interesting to be revisiting that idea this fifth season, just as it is watching Josh get into and out of the doghouse the same way C.J. does in a minor story arc in the first season.
Best Moments from Season One:  the first appearance of the President, quoting the First Commandment in the ""Pilot,"" Danny bringing C.J. a goldfish on the advice of Josh, Charlie coming to Zoey's defense in ""Mr. Willis of Ohio,"" the President getting a gift from the one Cabinet Secretary who will not be attending the State of the Union address in ""He Shall, From Time to Time..."", and the prophetic father's worst nightmare that Bartlett lays out for Zoey in ""Six Meetings Before Lunch"" (which also has the classic fight between Sam and Mallory on school vouchers).
Final Thought: It would be interesting if when Barlett's second is up if the show continued with a Republican Administration.  It will not happen, but it would certainly be interesting.",1070496000,25,4577,4.739622641509434

I thought that I might find the third (which is nearing the end of its run on cable/satellite television here) might be available in the US. No such luck! Nevertheless, while I'm here, I would like to record the pleasure and entertainment I derive from the series. If only the real West Wing were as Platonically high-minded and morally irreproachable as the Bartlett administration.
I do, however, have one real gripe about the show. There is a recurring character, ""Lord John Marbury"", who appears as an old friend of the President. Though shown to be a masterful political operator, not only is he portrayed as an arrogant, braying, upper-class English twit whose favourite pastime is putting down Leo, but the scriptwriters clearly have no idea about the realities either of the English nobility or the appointment of ambassadors. For the character to be ""Lord John"" he would be the son of a duke or a marquis, holding a courtesy title, i.e. not a ""real"" lord in his own right. Second, this ""Lord John"" is made British ambassador to the US, but it's clear from his earlier appearances that the man is no diplomat, and he is about as likely to be appointed ambassador to the US as President Bartlett is to be struck by a meteorite! And finally, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II would never be referred to as ""Her Royal Majesty""; if Marbury [sic] were presenting his credentials as incoming British ambassador, they would be signed by ""Her Britannic Majesty"". Details, I know, but as a Brit I get tired of caricature on American TV or in Hollywood films. But the series is superb overall.",1069632000,6,1728,4.668852459016393

1466150,5,B00005JLF3,"First this show is a masterpiece, in spite of the fact that it portrays an often bigoted view of the political ""right"" and make no mistake, many positions presented are exagerated.  One reason given for Rob Lowe leaving the show was that he was the only Republican member of the cast.
Despite occassional token flashes of Conservatives protrayed as acting in an honorable way, Sorkin's view of Republicans is drawn strictly from the furthest extremes of the party and does a disservice to the majority of Americans who refuse to subscribe to the fanatical fringe of either side, left or right.
That being said, it is an extremely entertaining show, even for Republicans, if you can choose not to let yourself feel offended by the stereotyping.  Sometimes, in fact, I find myself chuckling at the irony of Martin Sheen portraying a president often resorting to military force while the actor himself is so publically critical of President Bush's use of force with far more provocation!
Pres. Bartlet by the way, if far from being without flaw... he has lied to the American people by concealing the fact he has MS, and he has sanctioned the cold blooded murder of a foriegn dignitary and then conspired to conceal that fact.  They are flaws which make the character more human, and Bartlet often seems a man aware of his limitations... a trait it wouldn't hurt Mr. Sheen to learn.
By all means, enjoy... just remember always that the white hats are not always so white, and the black hats not always so black.  And seldom does one man, or one party have all the answers.
Alas, the current season, without Aaron Sorkin at the helm is proving to be disappointing so far.  Perhaps this will make the earlier seasons that much more of a joy to own.",1067558400,11,1743,4.701639344262295

What a poor show, this is one of, if not the finest drama ever ot come out of US television. The writing is sharp, the direction splendid, the acting and casting tremendous! The only bad thing about the West Wing is the depressing feeling you get after it when you realise that Jed Bartlett ISN'T the President! Get this DVD, its gripping stuff! And by all accounts, despite your wait, it seems you are getting a far better deal in the Extras department, so enjoy you guys..... Im actually a bit jealous!",1067212800,60,753,4.347517730496454

On November 18, the best show on television will be mass-marketed, hopefully opening the eyes of those who are not faithful watchers to the overwhelming power of the West Wing and maybe, just maybe, change American politics, making this awesome fairytale a reality.",1065916800,8,292,5.083333333333333
1466153,5,B00005JLF3,"As a UK resident you would think that I would not be interested in American politics. You would have been right, that was until I began whatching The West Wing on UK TV. A soon as the DVD was avaialble I had to have it, I now have Season One and Two. In Season One we get to meet the characters that form a close community who strive to provide us with an insight to the everyday goings-on in the White House. You immediately begin to warm to people whom you have never met before yet feel you could hold a conversation with if you met them. Season 1 leaves you with needing to know more, Season Two will not be issued quick enough for you. Season One starts well and finishes even better, well worth buying even if you are not a political fan but someone who enjoys strong story lines about people, places and events that surround one of the most talked about residences in the world.",1065657600,49,885,4.242603550295858
1466256,5,B00005JLF3,"This was the show that began the 'Government Craze' in television. The West Wing was truly original: a compelling drama, a trendsetting program, and a look into the inner workings of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue through the lives of the administration's most powerful people. That a show like this, without explosions and seldom a gunfight to be seen, could become so wildly popular is a testament to the ability of the American People to spot quality artistry. It certainly has renewed my hope in this country.
The premise of the show is that the viewers would see the inner workings of the executive branch through the most powerful people working there. Martin Sheen plays the President, Jed Bartlett, a highly principled and highly educated man who is nevertheless idealistic about America. John Spencer plays his Chief of Staff, Leo McGarry, Bartlett's closest adviser and confidante. Bradley Whitford plays Josh Lyman, McGarry's deputy and occasional loose cannon. Richard Schiff plays Director of Communications Toby Ziegler, a humorless, no-nonsense administrator. In the first few seasons, his deputy was played by Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn, who often brought humor and warmth to the show. There are countless other guest stars who would contribute to this show and deeply enrich it, making a show about politics both incredibly informative and deeply character-driven.
Some first season highlights include the Pilot, which introduces the characters in their element rather than just settling for lengthy exposition and has a few of the characters in trouble immediately with various groups. One need only watch the famed episode ""In Excelsis Deo"" to realize what a special show this would become. Other good shows include ""A Proportional Response"", in which the president learns the virtue of, well, proportion in foreign policy. ""Mr. Willis of Ohio"" is the story about a politician who actually makes decisions according to facts and conscience instead of polling and party lines. ""The Crackpots..."" features the first ""Big Block of Cheese Day"", which would become a kind of tradition in the show and afforded some humor as well as an examination of the fringe groups.
In short, The West Wing combines entertainment with education and, for what will perhaps be the only time, doesn't compromise either ideal. No wonder it's the most respected show on television. This belongs in everyone's DVD library.",1064793600,6,2407,5.238341968911917
1466257,5,B00005JLF3,"This show is the best and the most addictive television in my memory, and I remember watching first runs of the old Star Trek and Dick Van Dyke.  It portrays U.S. Politics as I wish they were, and is founded in a deep love and respect for our country and its principles.
Additionally, although it is unabashedly liberal in its viewpoint, it does not make the mistake of being unthinkingly partisan.  Issues are examined from both sides, some Republicans are portrayed as reasonable men of principle, and some Democrats are portrayed as hollow shells more interested in getting the job than doing well in it.  There is true balance that only the most dogmatic media watchers would fail to recognize.
As a recent convert to this show, my addiction to it is overwhelming, and I must admit my frustration with the fact that it is released in the U.S. slower than elsewhere.  This is the price we pay for having such a well developed entertainment infrastructure.  Companies release television shows slower here because they can run them on our many cable channels and pick up extra profits.  Obviously Bravo (where they are being re-run now) would pay less for the rights to broadcast West Wing if all its fans owned the entire thing on DVD.
Even so, it's worth the wait.  I record each show and watch it 2-4 times every day it is broadcast because the dialog is so good and so dense it generally needs repeat viewing to understand all the nuances.
Not only is this show a brilliant brass ring for us to strive for in our politics, it is equally a goal for our media companies to strive for when it comes to quality entertainment.  Add it to your wish list, it would be worth it at three times the price asked.",1063929600,4,1706,4.552287581699346
1466258,5,B00005JLF3,"Sadly enough, one of the few things that inspire me about American politics happens to be completely fictitious. But that's alright because I like Jed Bartlet, and we can pretend can't we? This series is absolutely incredible. Fantastic acting coupled with truly incisive, thought provoking episodes - you can only ask for one thing more, but unfortunately Bartlet can't run in 04. The West Wing has a decidedly left leaning stance, but more often than not the show tempers that with - and don't snicker - a fair and balanced view of the right. Though overall the politics of the show are quite liberal, the writers never smear it all over the place. I love the willingness to change things up in the plot, and to take on controversy head first. And really, this is one of the few shows I can watch and feel as if everything wasn't dumbed down for the lowest denominator.
Some of my favorite episodes: when the NASA probe is lost (including one of the best speeches ever about why the hell we still send men and materials up into the cold nether of space), and when an old politician filibusters his way into your heart.
I can't wait until November to realize I don't have enough money to buy the DVD, and then go out and rent it for three straight days.",1063756800,,1254,4.504385964912281
1466259,5,B00005JLF3,"I never fancied myself the type of person to, after watching a television show, pump my fist in the air and use the expression ""Now that's good television"". That was before ""The West Wing"", creator Aaron Sorkin's second foray into television and the first to be billed as a straight-up drama (but don't kid yourself, there are plenty of belly laughs to go around). Like its predecessor ""Sports Night"", TWW is built on an impeccably-casted ensemble group of actors and actresses, only this time they're in The White House. Also in typical Sorkin fashion, the series thrives on fast, punchy dialogue -- complete with wonderful Dr. Suess-like speech patterns and Chayefsky-like monologues.
In the first season, the drama and the stakes are never actually that high (until the cliffhanger season finale, that is), but you grow to believe they are as the staff works its way through various obstacles (from nominating a Supreme Court Justice to working past an information leak regarding the Chief of Staff's stint in drug rehab), sometimes triumphant and sometimes failing miserably. The fact that every little thing the staff does is so nationally scrutinized is the brilliance behind the show that can make the issue of passing one small piece of legislation into a what seems like national crisis.
The first season includes remarkable guest appearances, including Stockard Channing (who later becomes a regular), CSI's Jorja Fox, Edward James Olmos, hearing-impaired Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin (in a sexy recurring role), Karl Malden, and several bit parts for actors any ""Sports Night"" nut will surely recognize.
This Region 1 DVD release, which is being produced on 4 double-sided DVD-18 discs (in similar fashion to Warner's August 26th ER season 1 release), will surely be worth the wait for North Americans who chose not to order from the UK (since they've had theirs for about a year now), as this edition is set to include a host of special features not found on the R2 release. The greatest of these features is sure to be the commentary on select episodes from Aaron Sorkin (who wrote all 85 episodes of the series before his departure at the end of the fourth season) and producer/director Tommy Schlamme. I, personally, am also looking forward to the documentaries, gag reels, and deleted scenes.
I generally regard the last 10 to 15 minutes of each episode as some of the best television ever written, produced and acted. Fans of smart television shouldn't miss this one.",1063670400,4,2490,5.016908212560386

How disappointing then that US fans of this show must look outside their own country to buy the DVD set. I went to Amazon.co.uk (the British local site for Amazon) and found the West Wing Season 1 set there. Be forewarned, however: These are Region 2 discs, meaning they can be readily played only by folks in Europe, the Middle East and Japan. If you are in the US, with a standard (i.e., non-region free) US player, you are out of luck. Your only recourse is to buy  a ""Region Free"" player (many Web sites hawk modified low market players that can play any disc), modify your own player (don't even think about it), or try getting your computer DVD drive to play it.
This last option is what I've accomplished, and though I'm happy to be able to watch these West Wing episodes whenever I like, it's  a bummer to have to view them on my computer monitor. C'est la vie, I suppose.",1038960000,31,1109,4.404878048780488

Looking primarily at Amazon, I was more than a bit sad about that because I think the series is fantastic.  Anyway, low and behold whilst wandering through my local (store), I found the full Series 1 (2 DVD boxed sets of 3 DVDs each/all 22 episodes on DVD for ... some odd Assie dollars.
Fantastic - I'll get them I thought while I have the chance.  Not believxing my luck, I checked out the usually reliable US Amazon site to be informed (again) that ""...the studio is not releasing..."" WestWing just yet.  Well go figure because it is now occupying pride of place in my DVD library.  Interestingly, Amazon UK West Wing on DVD (albeit for a hell of a lot more money than my (store) locally (even with the postage).
I have spent literally thousand of dollars on Amazon DVDs (US) and up until now thought they were unbeatable in terms of movie range. I am dissapointed.  I am holding out for Series II (and III - which has not yet been aired in Australia).  Hopefully, Amazon will get back on the ball amd make these available to  audiences (including me) shortly. ...

The extras are interesting but to have each episode to watch again (and again) further reinforces how excellent the entire production is. The writing,as is often acknowledged,is A1 and in the frantic pace of the first viewing a couple of years ago, some of it was accidently missed. Now I can catch every word and expression and it adds so much to my overall liking of the show. It has also taught me a great deal about how the government ""works"" in the USA....very educational! Bring on the second series as quickly as possible, it is unfair to leave us hanging. If you are already a fan of the show, get the DVD's and relive the magic.
