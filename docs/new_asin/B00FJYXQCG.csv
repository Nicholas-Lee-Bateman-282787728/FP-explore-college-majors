5994089,5,B00FJYXQCG,"The four --- separate, 12 movie --- collections of the 48 Bowery Boys movies begin to slide downhill as regulars quit; get fired; die;
and just peter-out. I find the widescreen ones tremendously entertaining... trying to keep up with WHO is WHO. In fact, as the
""credits"" never mention WHO is WHO, they often don't mention everybody[either!].

The ""Dig That Uranium"" movie features an uncredited Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer... you know... ""Spanky"" and ""Darla's"" side-kick!",1384732800,,467,5.3108108108108105

I am 100% percent pleased with these 3 volumes.  Hats off to Standing Ovation for making them available. The copies I received are all pressed copies rather than on demand.
All that remains to be released are 12 remaining movies and the set will be complete!
It would be nice if the final 12 be released before the end of the year.
All of the Bowery Boys volumes released have been a total joy to watch and are indeed a trip down memory lane.
Watching them is like going back to the days when they were on TV and at the movies on Saturday afternoons.
It will make my day when all 48 are available!",1384473600,18,728,4.338235294117647

5994121,5,B00FJYXQCG,"As I've written in my other three reviews of the Warner Brothers' Archive Collection of the Bowery Boys, it is regrettable that these do not come with any commentaries, interviews or the disclaimers I think are necessary for all media products of the age before and at the start of Civil Rights.  The clarity and crispness of these restored works is, as I've said before about the others, wonderful.

We fans have waited decades for a proper collection of all 48 Bowery Boys films, and it must be a surprise to a lot of people that when these finally came out on DVD they were just the films and nothing else, a good eleven years after public proclivity for DVDs took hold and more than fifty years after the last film debuted. Because I love learning about the great part of United States history that took place in New York City, and because I enjoy watching these films with Leonard Getz' compendium From Broadway to the Bowery at my fingertips, I feel part of the reason for the delay must lie in people's eternal unwillingness to admit to the horrors / desperation / unchecked vices in their pasts.  It took an even longer time for the truth to go wide about New York's Five Points and the Bowery, so it makes total sense that somebody like Huntz Hall, who was from 30th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenues, wouldn't want to feature in anything that would upset the apple cart either family-wise or censor-wise. It also makes sense that as information goes wider via declassification, surviving stars and the families that succeed them upon their deaths go narrower and permissions become harder to negotiate. It is possible that some interviews, like the one where Hall mentions being in a childhood gang that included two girls good at shoplifting, would be the kind of reality check that would spoil the clean image the producers worked so hard to create out of some really tough, nasty talk and sometimes deeds. But for me, knowing this history and knowing that all that great dialogue was not out of nowhere but from the lives and histories of the speakers MAKES it fun. All the world's best loved epic stories feature good guys who were bad guys at the start, because a goodie ain't got what it takes to get other baddies. I hope the execs at WB, the families of the stars and others with a stake in the Dead End Kids, Little Tough Guys, East Side Kids and the Bowery Boys realize this and release more features with the kind of disclaimers WB attached to their Looney Tunes collection.

In this volume, I viewed Dig That Uranium and Crashing Las Vegas with some sadness, knowing the fates of both Bernard Gorcey and his son Leo. But I laughed all the same, as it is that kind of hardship that made the strong character and humor these guys touched us all with. They loved life no matter what it threw at 'em (or what they threw at it) and it shows.

Along with these great films, I recommend the compendium I mentioned earlier by Len Getz, the BBC America production on the old Five Points / Bowery district of Manhattan called Copper (available here on Amazon) and some historical maps of New York City (also on Amazon or other sites) for a good background on the areas mentioned in the films and on the places Leo, Huntz, Billy others lived. For example, in News Hounds (volume 2) Sach says Louie's Sweet Chop is on 3rd & Canal Street, and in a 1982 interview on David Letterman, Huntz Hall remembers going with his buddies a block over to yell at patients in the mental hospital, which shows up as the Bellevue Hospital, sanitarium and morgue, in it's old 1920s~'30s location.

Enjoy!",1414713600,,3598,4.561919504643963

5994123,5,B00FJYXQCG,"Once again Warner Archive have out did themselves with this great release. The prints themselves are beautiful. Films released in their Widescreen format are restored, and look amazing! Added bonus: if you order from Warner Archive direct you get pressed discs! Warner's seems to be ""sneaking"" in the Hall solo films instead of releasing the nine final films in Volume 4. This is fine with me as I enjoy have Sach hold the reins, although losing Gorcey is a major setback. At any rate you either loves these films or not. I LOVE them, and to be able to own these films is a blessing.

August 26th 2014: Today Warners released Volume 4. We now have all 48 Bowery Boys films, and I must say I never thought it would happen. Get your set today and show your support for these films. After all now comes the crusade to get the East Side Kids films released!!",1409097600,4,854,4.4743589743589745
5994124,5,B00FJYXQCG,I love watching these films. Especially the way some of the movies got that widescreen look. However I personally think they (the dvd makers) didn't carefully balance out the Stanley Clements films too well to have more of his films in the first 3 volumes as to avoid volume 4 from being Stanley Clements top heavy.  As a guess I think they realized this and that's why they are reluctant to release volume 4. Which makes me wonder wasn't the purpose of putting all these films in sporadic order to prevent volume 4 from being nothing but a Stanley Clements set in the first place? You SEE? This is what happens when you think marijuana is harmless. Because people who aren't stoned would have mapped out all 4 volumes more proficiently.,1407974400,2,737,4.625954198473282

There are no features what-so-ever, it would have been nice to have something. Even trailers would have been nice but I suppose WB has done us quite a service by finally releasing the films.",1404691200,,361,4.402985074626866

5994129,5,B00FJYXQCG,"I grew up with these guys. And one of my biggest disappointments was always thinking that I will never get to see the Bowery Boys again. The I found the Dead End Kids and the Clansey Street Boys but that wasn't good enough. That was going too far back in time for me and although they are very good to have, they were the episodes without Louie and his sweet shop.
Then came the Bowery Boys volumes 1 & 2. I got those right away knowing though that they were not complete. When 3 came out, nostalgia heaven. I have them all and I can relive my Sunday mornings of my child hood with Slip, Satch and Louie and the rest of the gang. I now have everything that Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Bernard Gorcey did.

5994130,4,B00FJYXQCG,"Great collection of the Bowery Boys. The series was starting to wind down in the late 50's. Sadly Bernard Gorcey { Louie} died in a auto accident after "" Dig that Uranium"" which really affected his son Leo {Slip Mahoney} He only made one more Bowery Boys feature after that {Crashing Las Vegas} and left the franchise leaving Huntz Hall and Leo's brother David as the only orginal Bowery Boys. Stanley Clements came in as Duke who replaced Leo and instead of Louies Sweat Shop it was Mike Clancy's luncheonette. All in al i really liked this volume and I understand Volume 4 will come out soon.",1402185600,2,594,4.5607476635514015
5994131,5,B00FJYXQCG,"I wrote Warner Brothers on 5/31/2014 and had the following dialogue with a representative: Me: Do you plan to produce a comprehensive chronological complete series of the Bowery boys soon; or are you going to settle for the 3 volume set?! Thanks!

W. B.  Yes. Volume 4 work is still in process. Thanks.

Me: Your answer ""yes"" is referring to what question? A 'new' comprehensive ""chronological"" complete set, or rather just adding another volume to the existing volumes?! Thank you!

W. B. There will be a Volume 4 thereby creating a complete set of all 48 films. There are no plans at this point to create anything beyond the final volume. Sorry for the confusion.

So  this seems to kill any chance for a chronological set! Oh well; better than nothing...huh?!",1401580800,,762,4.778625954198473
5994132,4,B00FJYXQCG,"This set,the next to last installment of the series,sees us going from Angels Alley(Mar/48) and ending with the next to last film of the entire series Up in Smoke(Dec/57).The set also contains Leo Gorcey's last film Crashing Las Vegas. This and the one before,Dig that Uranium(also included), shows a Gorcey not  in the greatest of shape. A bit wobbly at times,and looking like he had had a fortifier or two before the camera rolled. His father's death really hit him hard.
From the early 50s onwards the films change into w/s format,which most folks have never seen,unless they were in a theatre when they were originally shown. The last four films of this set are from the last seven Hall did to end the series and they were done with Stanley Clements. It is not that they were bad,it is just the dynamic we all came to love with Gorcey and the rest of the guys had almost vanished. Hall was now the star and his character became a little more forceful,not the weak clueless we had come to know and love.
The print quality,as like the previous sets,gets better the later the date of release. And like the ones before, Warners has done little to clean them up. What a shame. They could all sparkle if that had been the case. That is why all these sets I have reviewed get a four star instead of a five.",1401494400,,1303,4.451882845188284
