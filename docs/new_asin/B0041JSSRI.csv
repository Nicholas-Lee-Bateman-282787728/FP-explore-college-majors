4242834,2,B0041JSSRI,"Kill or Be Killed (Ivan Hall, 1977)

I've seen the sequel to this movie more times than I can count, but I'd never actually seen the first one until just last week. (Though it's tough to think of Kill and Kill Again as a sequel now that I've seen this one, which is only distantly related at best-- some of the actors come back, but in different roles than they have here.) As expected, it's mountains of cheesy goodness.

Steve Hunt (James Ryan) is a fighter who gets caught up in... honestly, I'm not sure I can describe this. There's an ex-Nazi and a Japanese guy who are accusing each other of cheating at the 1936 Olympics, and who want to put teams of karateka together to re-enact the Olympics to prove once and for all who's the best. (The fact that neither sticks to his own race is rather problematic, given this setup.) As well, these fights are explicitly stated to be to the death. (Which makes it somewhat odd when everyone gets restless with the death of one of the combatants, which doesn't happen until the match is well underway.) But I get ahead of myself. The bulk of the movie is taken up with the Nazi, Baron von Rudloff (Norman Coombes), putting his team together and training them. It seems that in the late seventies, no one had any problem with people walking around in full SS regalia and employing dwarves as personal assistants (and making them dress up as Nazis as well. Yes, I'm serious).

Yes, it's as bad as you're expecting given that synopsis. However, it's unintentionally hysterical most of the time, and on that level, it's well worth the hoops you'll have to go through to track it down. You thought Gymkata was bad? That's Oscar-caliber compared to this mess. But then, so is Kill and Kill Again. * ",1223510400,3,1739,4.511111111111111

4242836,1,B0041JSSRI,The movie quality and sound horrible; I regret buying it! Was it recorded with a vhs camcorder from a TV screen and then re-recorded unto a dvd? This should not even be for sale its a Rip-off!,1502668800,,192,4.216216216216216
4242837,4,B0041JSSRI,"I love cheesy action, horror and comedy films from the late 70s through the 90s and this is one that I have been looking for. It is a shame that the second film is so hard to find or when I do it the buyer wants a kings ransom for it. Both are great fun if one does not get to bogged down in the details of plot, acting, etc.

8412827,1,B0041JSSRI,"The action scenes are entertaining, but the acting is as bad as it gets, and the dwarf is not to be believed. The premise is ludicrous, with a modern day Nazi luring the best karate fighters in the world to his fortress in the desert to fight, all for the sake of avenging his humiliating defeat in the distant past to his Japanese arch enemy. This is crass and exploitative, to say the least.",1521417600,,393,4.324324324324325

8412830,3,B0041JSSRI,I am being so very generous here! I must be in a great mood today. Any other day and I would be stepping all over this movie. A martial arts champ is lured to a desert fortress where he's to partake in an Olympic-like contest. He then finds out the contest is headed by a criminal mastermind who happens to be German and has swastikas everywhere. He wants a team to take on his arch nemesis who happens to be Japanese and who he challenges to get his own group of fighters. That is the story in a nutshell and that is all it is. There is some pretty good fight scenes but awful acting and the story leaves much to be desired. It is totally predictable. We do get the requisite female that the hero is in love with and of course she is used as leverage. This was 1976 and I guess the helpless female was still a thing. I really would not recommend this except for a snowy cold night where you have literally nothing to do....at all.,1509580800,,931,4.149171270718232
8412831,3,B0041JSSRI,I have the sequel to this movie kill and kill again. At the time i purchased the sequel this the original was not on dvd. Finally years later it was available on dvd at a very low price. I liked the sequel. but was disappointed in this the original. The movie moves along but there are so many faults. I thought the movie could have been better. It displays on the cover  The Greatest hollywood Movie ever Made. Not so. Let me list several faults. James Ryan the star does too many acrobatics. Flips in mid air and what not. I don't doubt his skills as a martial artist. But I prefer more hand to hand combat. Perhaps the stunts were a Hollywood thing. Secondly the female lead seem to not take things seriously even in a difficult  situation. She almost always was smiling. And 2 of the opponents looked like  the living dead. Was that meant to be funny? Maybe just another Hollywood thingThere is some entertainment. After all its only a movie. But it could have been better.,1505174400,,977,4.416666666666667
