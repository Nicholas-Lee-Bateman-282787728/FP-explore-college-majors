8306213,5,097624540X,"This DVD series is popular with kids for a reason -- it makes drawing fun.

The creator of this award-winning series is an elementary school art teacher, who is also an experienced professional animator (who worked on Fox's ""Futurama"", and on shows for Disney TV), who cares enough about children to create a DVD series that shows them a fun approach to creating realistic drawings.

The importance of this series is that it takes something very difficult -- creating realistic drawings -- and makes it simple and accessible for people of all ages. In Volume 1, viewers are introduced to ""Secret Shapes"", which are the building blocks of realistic (and even cartoon-style) drawings.

90% of all people -- children and adults -- can learn something from this video. In just minutes, viewers can learn how to draw the basic shapes needed to create realistic drawings. The artist demonstrates how
to use these shapes to create a variety of objects, such as a hand, rose, ghost, house, car, drums, etc.,plus imaginative characters, including a skiing snowman and an ice cube robot. The host is a professional artist who makes drawing look deceptively easy. It is simple, accessible and fun, but it's not easy. Anyone who has left a negative comment about this DVD should try to actually do the lessons themselves. The artist makes it look like anyone can draw -- and they can -- but like anything
you have to learn how to do it. For example, if you don't know how to snowboard, and you watch a professional snowboarder on TV, you might think it looks easy and fun. Professionals get paid to make things look easy. When a professional offers to show you how to do something yourself, that's a golden opportunity. This DVD is a real golden opportunity to learn drawing from an actual professional artist.

There's a lot to learn about drawing on this DVD. Don't be put off by the fact that it looks simple and easy... that's the point! As they say in the series: ""Have fun drawing!""",1202774400,,1976,4.7354651162790695
8306214,5,097624540X,"The first volume of Drawing Power is a great tool to get children interested in drawing and on the path to honing their skills. Mastering simple shapes is the first step to conquering more complex drawings as your child progresses through the volumes. I've witnessed various children watch this disc repeatedly while following the lessons, becoming excited about bringing their ideas to life. Michael Moodoo is passionate about drawing and it shows in his presentation. This DVD provides all the knowledge your child needs to start on the path to drawing whatever their imaginations can conjur. I hope Amazon will offer the other videos in the series: Dinosaur drawing and Pirate drawing. They build upon the basics in this disc and teach children to draw a multitude of dinosaurs and various pirate-themed scenes.",1201910400,,814,5.12781954887218
8306215,5,097624540X,"Fantastic! My 3 grandkids (ages 3, 7 and 9) love this DVD! They watch it over and over, practicing and perfecting their skills. I also bought the Dinosaur and the Pirate drawing DVD's in this series.

Some other people gave this DVD a negative review, which I didn't understand, because this is a great DVD. My middle grandson didn't like art class or drawing at school. Through the wonderfully imaginative lessons on this DVD, learning to draw became easy and fun for him.

The kids love drawing the cool characters, especially the skiing snowman and the ice cube robot! The DVD also shows simple and creative ways for kids to draw a car, a rose, a ghost, a house, a hand, etc. I highly recommend this DVD.",1201824000,2,707,4.559055118110236
8306216,1,097624540X,"The previous reviewer was generous in saying this video might be appropriate for children. It is simply awful. Not worth the shipping costs.  Fortunately, I got it free through the public library.",1201737600,,196,5.125
8306217,1,097624540X,"I am a 5th through 8th grade art teacher in my 9th year.  I was looking for a DVD simple enough for a substitute to use.  Yes, this is simple, but my 5th graders would balk at how boring and simplistic this stuff is.

It states it is recommended for ages 5+.  I would say that 5 year olds are about the oldest child who would appreciate this ""Video 1""

The product description and DVD box are misleading.  The cover shows horses and monsters, which I thought would be fun for my students.

Apparently, there are 6 volumes.  On the back of the DVD it lists things such as ""My ultimate theme park"" and ""My ultimate portrait drawing""...I thought, great, this should be perfect for 10 year olds...but these are not on THIS DVD.  This DVD is only 16 minutes long and the following is what it entails:

1.  How to draw a cube and things that can be made out of a cube (like dice and a few other items)
2.  How to draw a sphere (a bowling ball plus a few other items)
3.  How to draw a cylinder (a pop can plus a few other items)
4.  How to draw a tube (a pencil plus a few other items)
5.  How to draw a sheet (a sheet??) (a magic carpet plus a few other items)

That's it!!!

I am very disappointed and going to see if a colleague who teaches kindergarten would even want it.  Or, since I already unwrapped it, maybe I can take it to my local used DVD/book store and see if they'll give me some of my money back.",1189900800,3,1407,4.036231884057971
