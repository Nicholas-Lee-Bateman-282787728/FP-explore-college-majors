7713345,5,B01DKC2A2K,"The ability to deliver quality asinine horror is no small achievement. Trust me, I grew up in the sixties watching all those films from the fifties. These five Tremor flicks are great if you are looking for something scary  but not too scary, gory  but not too gory, and has a sense of humor. If this description has now wet your appetite I highly recommend you assblast yourself up a copy of this economical collection and you (*probably*) won't be disappointed. Also, don't forget to check out the oneseason (13episodes) TV series spinoff that ran on the SciFi channel.",1465776000,7,571,4.757575757575758

7713352,5,B01DKC2A2K,"Tremors is a classic.  I knew that coming into it.

But I was very pleasantly surprised how well 2 and 3 hold up, and how well written they are.

4 makes granddaddy Gummer too low down, but I do recommend the making of special.

They made a bad decision in making 5 too serious.  And going CGI.  Loses the charm.

Still, get deal.",1523750400,2,330,4.142857142857143
