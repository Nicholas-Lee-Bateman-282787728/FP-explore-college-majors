2745296,4,B000MRJPZ2,"Cardio Party Remix is part of the Turbo Jam Live series.  Here, instructor Chalene Johnson is unscripted--she talks more, moves about the class, and displays a higher energy level overall.  The workout itself incorporates many sequences from the previous three Cardio Party workouts.  In particular, the 4-minute warm-up was reminiscent of CP1, with virtually the same moves, just performed in a shorter time frame.  Other familiar exercises include plenty of knee lifts, turbo twist, Tai punches, howzit, zig-zag knees, punch high-low, and of course finesse/jenga.  I was a little disappointed that there weren't more kicks; there is a front knee/back kick combo and a section that includes a few side kicks, but that's about it.  However, I did like that this workout wasn't a space hog, particularly in terms of side-to-side movements (my exercise space is limited!).  Finally, for fans of the high-energy turbo segments, this workout includes two turbos back-to-back with only a brief water break in-between (at about the 20-minute mark).  The workout concludes with a 3-minute cool-down and 2-minute Tai Chi stretch, bringing in the total time at 31 minutes; as with all Beach Body videos, there is a helpful countdown clock on screen.  The only really negative I see to this video is that Chalene gives even less instruction and cueing than she does in her other workouts.  She seems to assume that you already know the moves, so if you've never tried Turbo Jam before, I wouldn't recommend starting with this DVD.  For Turbo Jam fans, however, this is a great workout to add to your collection--overall 4 1/2 stars!",1177372800,48,1622,5.083018867924529
2745337,4,B000MRJPZ2,I love Chalene! She always delivers a great workout. The choreography was a little harder to follow than cardio party-which is my all time favorite- but still a great workout!,1447113600,,175,4.866666666666666
2745338,5,B000MRJPZ2,I love it.,1439769600,,10,2.6666666666666665

2745340,2,B000MRJPZ2,Love Chalene but live was waste of money.  Not worth it.,1407974400,,56,4.090909090909091
2745341,3,B000MRJPZ2,"This is the 4th Turbo Jam video I tried after getting a little bored with the others. It is a little tougher than Cardio Party 3, which is still my favorite. A faster pace, more jumping. Good workout. Still recommend starting with Learn and Burn to begin with, and building up to this.",1402358400,2,285,4.39622641509434
2745342,1,B000MRJPZ2,"Didn't like it. Found the comments annoying ""Orange County"" over and over.  Tried it a second time with the sound off. Still didn't like it.",1392681600,,140,4.6
2745343,5,B000MRJPZ2,Fun and awesome workout! I like that it is 30 minutes long. This one will definitely give you a sweat.,1385683200,,102,4.15
2745344,5,B000MRJPZ2,"This is an awesome DVD from Chalene Johnson and the Turbo Jam series! There are 2 ""Live"" DVDs, both filmed in a gym class. I like that there are a lot of people in it that are in other videos as well. It truly is a re-mix - there are routines (and I mean exact routines, down to the music and everything) from Cardio Party 1 and 2 here, but they are much faster versions than on the original DVDs. I love combo from CP1 with the Tai Kwon Do punches, but I like this faster version! Also, there are 2 turbos back to back in this one, which is rare in Turbo Jam. I think if you can do this one, you are ready to try Turbo Fire. It is that much faster than most Turbo Jam DVDs are!",1384473600,,678,3.85
2745345,5,B000MRJPZ2,i was very happy with the entire process. the service was very fast and very efficient. a very happy customer,1363651200,,109,4.5
2745346,5,B000MRJPZ2,I loved it! It's a quick 30 min workout with 2 turbo burst. The music was great & so was the workout. It took me a couple of times to get the moves but once you got it you got! I loved it because it was simply fun to do. Plus they have someone modifying the moves if its too difficult.,1351900800,,285,3.6885245901639343
2745367,5,B000MRJPZ2,"this is probably one of my favorite turbo jam workouts, it's quick and really gets the heart pumping.  it's very fun too!",1350259200,,121,4.5
2745368,5,B000MRJPZ2,Only DVD I was missing for my complete set.  Very fast delivery & in great shape. On my way to my goal weight. I absolutely love the Turbo Jams work outs. Chalene really gets you pumped up and excited to do a work out. Thanks,1346889600,,225,4.0
2745369,4,B000MRJPZ2,"Dont get me wrong, this gives you a great workout in a shorter time period, but I do prefer the other Turbo Jam workouts over this one.  Ive been doing Turbo Jam for a while now, but during this workout I felt confused and had to stop and say, "" What?"" a few times.  Im used to always knowing what moves are coming up.  Still a good workout though and Im sure I'll be fine after doing it a few times.",1316736000,,400,3.9135802469135803
2745370,4,B000MRJPZ2,"I still like the original Cardio Party best, but the 30 minute time is a nice compromise between the 20 minute and 45 minute routines.",1308182400,,134,4.4
2745371,5,B000MRJPZ2,"I LOVE turbojam (I think I've mentioned that in a few of my previous reviews :)). This is one of my favorites for a quick workout. If you have only 30 minutes, this is the one to do. Great music and high energy. I have a 2 year old, so finding time to get my workout in is a workout in itself, but the music is so good that I can ""talk him into"" doing a few kicks and jumps with me - therefore keeping him busy/ happy. By the time he realizes that he doesn't have mommy's full attention the workout is over - PERFECT. Did I mention this is one of my favorite turbojam videos ?!?!",1304035200,,579,3.9152542372881354
2745372,5,B000MRJPZ2,Another great DVD from Chalene!  30 minutes of a great make you sweat workout with an awesome cool down.  I love it!,1241395200,,116,4.2272727272727275
2745373,4,B000MRJPZ2,"This is a 30 minute workout but feels like a 50 minute one! It has 2 turbo's 30 seconds apart in the middle. There's one thing  that tends to  bother me a little with all the workouts is that Chalene seems to get the right and left sides mixed up an awful lot because she forgets if she's talking about here right or your right plus she always talks about working out as their mirror image so ""your right is her right as well"" (when in actuality that's not what a mirror image is- your right is their left). And in this particular one they forget to stretch one side of the body on a particular stretch. Of course after you do it enough you learn how to fix it up yourself a little. It's just these minor things that I'm giving it a four. The workout itself is fun.",1232323200,10,765,4.093333333333334
2745374,5,B000MRJPZ2,This is a great addition to all of my Turbo Jam Workouts. It is really fun and it is only 30 minutes so it is great to do when you are short on time. All of the moves are from the Cardio Party's so there isn't anything new to learn but the combo's are different and you are sweating in a really short period of time. I would highly reccomend if you love TJ!,1226793600,3,357,3.8378378378378377
2745375,5,B000MRJPZ2,I usually don't do such a short workout but it's so intense and so fun and so HARD! I just run before I do it. You won't regret buying this one! Music is good. Very casual setting. One girl needs to take off her hat. Geez silly! Other than that distraction very very good workout.,1217894400,4,280,4.109090909090909
2745376,5,B000MRJPZ2,"As the other reviewer said, this is an intense workout in a short time period.  It is definitely a condensed version of CP1, and the 2 turbos really make it a great cardio workout. I love this one.  I wish Chalene would do more 30-min. workouts.  Some days I just don't have 45-60+ minutes to devote to my workout!  Also, you need to be familiar with the Turbo Jam workouts and moves before attempting this one.  It is lots of fun and you will SWEAT!",1198368000,21,450,4.247058823529412
8171464,5,B000MRJPZ2,Great!,1526601600,,6,6.0
8171465,2,B000MRJPZ2,This DVD is hard to follow and is mostly boxing - hardly any lower body work.  It was not a good workout for me and I couldn't get my heart rate up doing it since I was too concerned with trying to follow the moves.  Would not recommend unless you like a lot of boxing and complicated choreography that isn't cued beforehand.,1519603200,,325,4.225806451612903
8171466,4,B000MRJPZ2,"I've got 3 of these Turbo Jam videos and use them a lot. This is my favorite. Works best if you've done #2 or #3 first and are somewhat familiar with the moves. This one is brief, focused, energetic, feels great to do. Not a wasted moment. As usual, Chalene's cuing is confusing, hyper, scatter-brained and inept. But I love the routines and they are simple to learn.",1516060800,,367,4.411764705882353
8171467,5,B000MRJPZ2,its a great workout,1515888000,,19,4.0
8171468,5,B000MRJPZ2,Excellent!,1510704000,,10,10.0
8171469,5,B000MRJPZ2,"This is a tougher workout if you mostly do Turbo Jam. I still do Turbo Jam AND Turbo Fire - this DVD is like right in between these both based on hardness, in my opinion.

One caveat - she does not do a great job explaining the next move before she does it- I believe it's called ""cue-ing."" If you are new to Turbo Jam, I would NOT start with this DVD. However, if you are familiar with her moves, you should be able to pick it up after a few times doing it.

I really enjoy the shorter length and the multiple turbos. Great energy by all in the video, and fun music!",1500422400,,567,3.9649122807017543
