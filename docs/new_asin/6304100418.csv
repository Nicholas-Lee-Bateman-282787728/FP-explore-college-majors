7861565,4,6304100418,"Funny....The first one with Mira Sorvino was nominated for an Academy Award and directed by Susan Seidleman. So...maybe you all were looking for light porn...this is called ""erotica"" which implies a bit of ""art"". Anyway, clearly I like it more then not.",1488758400,,253,5.0476190476190474

7861567,4,6304100418,"I have no idea where the first reviewer is coming from. I watched the film very easily although my DVD had flaws so there had to be a lot of stopping, reversing and fast forwarding. In the first segment Mia Sorvino gets entranched with a Dutch painting and tries to become part of the
scene to fulfill some fantasies. I found this segment to be the weakest.
In the second, one young man keeps following a beautiful woman around the beach, in the hotel dining areas and even tries listening from outside her hotel room. He hears buzzing sounds which turn out to be didios for
her gratification. Finally catching up, he finds reality is far different
than reality. This is fun. The third segment by Melvin Peebles is a wild gem.  VROOM, VROOM, VROOM takes a young virginal guy on a fantasy voyage when a spirit helps meet his needs. The music is lively and fun red hot.
Finally, a beautiful lady enters a bathtub sales firm just as it is closing, to use the washroom. She then tries to get the manager to let her try out bathtubs.  Using her sexy guiles, she gets him to let her sit in one with all the jets going. The end is funny and unpredictable. I can see 4 stars for this segment and VROOOM alone.  But there is very little
sex or erotica. There is a lot of playful pyscho-sexual enjoyment.
My real rating is 3***. In no way can I see this rated any less. So, I have tried to even the first reviewer's pitiful 1*.  Have fun and enjoy the hot tub.",1213401600,2,1450,4.281021897810219
7861568,1,6304100418,"This movie may have raised erotic feelings in me when I was twelve years old, but at sixty-two, it raised nothing. Mira Sorvino is one of my favorites, but even her presence could not help elevate these juvenile stories to a level worth watching.

If you do decide to watch this movie, at least sit at your piano and practice Beethoven while watching, that way you will not be totally wasting your time.",1212364800,,403,4.52054794520548
7861569,3,6304100418,I was very disappointed in the role Mira Sorvino played as a black haired dental aid dreaming of sexual activity of men and women in a picture in a gallery. I liked her better as a blond sexual symbol.,1145577600,,201,4.17948717948718
7861570,5,6304100418,"The movie was pretty much a dud until the final one ""Wet"". WOW!
They saved the best short film for last! Cynda is incredibly gorgeous and the camera didn't miss her beautiful body. It was tastefully done and it didn't go overboard with exploitation. The eye popping ""money shot"" is when she stood up in the tub with suds running down her backside, WOW!!
That shot alone gives this movie 5 stars from me. This review refers to the DVD version",1069804800,,441,4.45679012345679
7861571,2,6304100418,"The Video ""Tales of Erotica"" which has 4 short movies is basically Tales of ""Silliness"" since none of the stories are based on erotic reality. My favorite was the final story, ""Wet"" which featured the beautiful Cynda Williams. The only erotic and exciting thing about this video is it's 4th story ""Wet"" and the nude shot of Cynda William's perfectly shaped buttocks as she rises from the hot tub dripping ""wet"" from the bubbly water......she is definitley worth looking at.",1017878400,6,473,4.925
7861572,2,6304100418,"The Erotic Tales video I'm reviewing has Mira Sorvino on the cover as pictured, and is 4 short stories. The Mira Sorvino one is so forgettable that I can't think of a thing to say, only that Mira doesn't get particularily erotic or nude. The Melvin Van Peebles episode was laughable, repeditive, and again not erotic.....no, only the Ken Russell episode made this worthwhile. Not erotic ""spank"" material to be sure, but it kept me interested, and I found it intriguing, erotic to a degree, and I was dissappointed when that segment finished.",992736000,5,541,4.827956989247312
7861573,1,6304100418,I like erotic movies but this one was just awful.  I REALLY disliked it.  The plot and the acting was not done well at all.  Save your money and your time.,957225600,13,155,3.935483870967742
