8707193,4,B00UKG6WX8,"First off, I got say I'm a sucker for any backstage/Hollywood story. Hollywood Story was a movie I watched ages ago and have been waiting for it to turn up again. Thanks to TCM it's back again. The transfer seem good for such an old, obscure film. Robert Osborne does a quick intro and the movie has some location work, including the old Chaplin Studios on La Brea. Richard Conte was an always overlooked presence in films, and here he delivers a solid performance. I would say if you like old Hollywood, you'll like this film.",1434931200,11,527,4.5
