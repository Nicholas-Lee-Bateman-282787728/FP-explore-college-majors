8310559,5,B000NKL8E4,"Good quality DVD about the Hamilton watch Co. My husband just purchased a  1940""s Hamilton Railroad Pocket watch; this is a great way to explore the background of this company and watch making in the US. It is a factory tour as well as illustrating how a good hand made watch is constructed.",1385596800,,291,4.490566037735849
