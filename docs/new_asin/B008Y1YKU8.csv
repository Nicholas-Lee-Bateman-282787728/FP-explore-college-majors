5189962,4,B008Y1YKU8,"As a retired solider, I enjoy most all of the military based television programs.  This one portrays some good things and some difficult things about military life.",1355529600,,164,5.074074074074074
5189963,5,B008Y1YKU8,"If you are looking for excellent, common-person-accessible drama from the early 1960's -- or if you are a rabid ""Star Trek"" fan who wonders what pre-Trek things this excellent series creator, Gene Roddenberry, had done, look no further -- ""The Lieutenant"" is in the house!  This sterling example of good, adult-level drama (that is, where it's smart enough for grown-up tastes) is, well, sort of a ""Army Wives"" type of show from the military male point of view.  It's a wisely-done series, one where the show's protagonist, Marine 2nd Lt. William Tiberius Rice (that's right, Trekkers -- ""Tiberius"" -- played by Gary ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" Lockwood) is a flawed protagonist who often gets a lecture by his superiors, often in the form of Capt. Rambridge (Robert ""Man From UNCLE"" Vaughn.)  This show is a ""journey show"" about a Marine still learning the ropes of the Corps -- which in and of itself makes for high-caliber drama beyond compare.  Check out ""The Lieutenant"" -- and march forth!",1355443200,4,991,4.916167664670659
5189964,5,B008Y1YKU8,This  series is  an often overlooked  gem by Gene Rodenberry.  Made in the  early 1960's it only lasted a season but  each episode  tackled what it  was  like to be a  marine Lieutenant  in the  period.  Not  seen  on tv  for  decades it has  finally been released on  dvd and it is a must  get. It has  a  great cast including Robert Vaughn in his  pre Man From UNCLE  perion.,1350950400,2,377,4.057142857142857
5189965,5,B008Y1YKU8,"I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw this old fave of mine on Pre-order, I NEVER thought I would. I have recently received my two half seasons, in excellent quality by the way, and have started to go through them. It is interesting to note that supporter Robert Vaughn went from this (1 season) to his big hit, ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E"",after having done ""The Magnificent Seven"" earlier. I really am enjoying what I am seeing, the wole season appears to be building to the events in the last movie length episode when all problems will be answered. Star Garry Lockwood went on to do 2001, a space odyessy, later in the decade and tended to fade from sight. Great theme by veteran composer Jeff Alexander. I'm so glad I got mine.",1349654400,5,732,4.470149253731344
5189966,5,B008Y1YKU8,"The Lieutenant is a 1963-64 dramatic series starring Gary Lockwood and Robert Vaughn. Lockwood is excellent in his role as a newbie US Marine officer, second lieutenant William Rice. Lockwood expertly portrays Rice with both sensitivity and strength of character. Vaughn is his captain in charge and plays the role with the seriousness and intelligence that one can expect from him. Created by Gene Roddenberry the episodes contain a variety of human emotions and the tele-dramas play out well and hold one's interest right to the end. After watching the first part of season one episodes (which you must buy separately) I knew I was going to want to see the rest of the season's episodes and they are equally satisfying. The series didn't make it to a second season back in 1964 but that wasn't because of reviews or viewership. It garnered good reviews and was gaining an audience but reportedly things fell apart as Lockwood wanted to pursue a career in motion pictures rather than television, Vaughn wanted to star in his own television series and CBS was wary of continuing the series anyway as U.S. involvement in the VietNam war was escalating and the network didn't want to be accused of ""toxic programming"". It's all history now and The Lieutenant was a drama that came along and went in one brief season but is certainly worth viewing again now. Good writing and acting never fail to please. I'm thankful that the Warner Archives decided to release this series on DVD..now if they will release Mr. Novak the great 1963-65 TV drama series about high school teacher John Novak we will have another intelligent series on DVD.",1348704000,14,1632,4.853046594982079
5189967,5,B008Y1YKU8,"Mid-sixties television.  Everyone smoked, everyone drank, and clean cut preppy was the norm.  The Marine Corps was still the Marine Corps.
Robert Culp turned in a perfect portrayal of a hard nosed Marine Captain.  Gary Lockwood is a 2nd Lieutenant and the dynamics between the two is as it should be.  Hokey at times, sexist at times, but a time capsule of a simpler time in America.",1474070400,,383,4.6716417910447765

5189969,4,B008Y1YKU8,"A very dated show. However, the storylines were often interesting and even thought provoking. Showed how the Marines trained prior to the build up of American forces in Vietnam.",1472169600,,177,5.137931034482759

5189971,5,B008Y1YKU8,"Excellent television series. My father fought as a Marine in WWII. The dramas and lessons are relevant in 2016.
Lockwood does a very good job playing a newly minted officer.",1469318400,,173,4.8
5189972,5,B008Y1YKU8,Very cool old series from the 60s. I love it. I was in the Marine Corps. in the early 70s and this is very true to life and realistic. Gary Lockwood is great!,1468368000,,158,3.8181818181818183
5189973,5,B008Y1YKU8,"The Lieutenant is a great series to me. I saw a couple of the shows on a reto tv station a few weeks ago and liked them enough that I wanted all the shows, It was produced for two years and are on dvd as part 1 and part 2. I had to have all the shows so bought both and really enjoyed all of them. I was in the Army in the same time frame as this shows setting and we did a lot of the things as these Marines so it is realistic. The story lines are very good also. They had some good writers. Would buy again.",1466899200,,509,3.6363636363636362

5189979,5,B008Y1YKU8,"A continuation of the thought-provoking, short-lived series by Gene Roddenberrry. This second season continues to showcase the talents of a parade of guest stars (and future stars to come). Each episode continues to be a character study, and each one will make you think. This series aired in 1963-1964, at a simpler time in our history, and this season finds Lieutenant Rice in the position as a military advisor to Vietnam. It was America on the brink, and each episode is thought-provoking. Gary Lockwood and Robert Vaughn were two of the finest talents of their time, and I only wish this series had had a longer run. Two seasons didn't do justice to all who were connected with the making and production of one of the best television series of its time.",1440892800,,758,4.75

5189982,5,B008Y1YKU8,"Good Show.. Watched it some when I was a kid. I've not watch everyone, but some. I like Robert Vaughn. Wished they had more stories around him. The tapes came in fine. The only thing is I would of preferred the whole season as one, and the price was kind of high for each part... But nonetheless a great show..",1430611200,,310,4.183333333333334
5189983,5,B008Y1YKU8,Excellent series.  Accurate depiction of the Corps just prior to our involvement in Vietnam.  Every episode a winner.  This was a Gene Roddenberry pre Star Trek production.  The man was ahead of his time and The Lieutenant proved it.,1430611200,,233,4.897435897435898

5189986,5,B008Y1YKU8,"A great, yet short-lived series concerning the professional and private life of a USMC second-Lieutenant.  It stars Gary lockwood in the title-role, and Robert Vaughn as his Company-Commander.",1415923200,,192,5.857142857142857
5189987,4,B008Y1YKU8,"If you enjoy the ethical viewpoints of Gene Roddenberry you will enjoy these short stories. It reminds me of the early original series Star Trek episodes. Duty, honor, and service trump self interest. It may be simplistic to some, but then codes of ethics are simple. The challenge is live up to the code. The show takes place in a marine training environment at the ""advisor"" stage of US involvement.",1412812800,,401,4.742857142857143
5189988,4,B008Y1YKU8,The Lieutenant aired in the early 1960's with Gary Lockwood. It was great and showed the men in the Marines like they are. When Vietnam came television seemed to cut programs like this. What this shows is the courage and commitment those in our armed forces have. They are not responsible for how they may be used. I think it points out why those of us not in the armed forces must be involved so these men are not abused. Part 1 was better.,1404518400,,441,4.261904761904762
5189989,5,B008Y1YKU8,"This kind of gives you a peek into how the creator of Star Trek thought TV drama should work. It's got a much broader appeal than Trek, since it's not space opera, but would be of particular interest to Trek fans. Quite a few actors who appeared in the '60s Star Trek show up here, too. The stories themselves are fascinating, albeit what we might call ""simpler"" than TV tends to be today. (Read that with a slightly sarcastic tone: modern stories tend to be about issues that arise in contexts involving a lot of money and/or unlikely personal or career situations; these stories are more akin to what I think real people would face in their, you know, real lives.)

Looks like it got dumped for being a bit too prescient regarding social issues and the military at a time when those things weren't a good fit for popular consumption. Wish it had gone on longer, though. It's a good piece of work.",1388707200,4,898,4.475609756097561
5189990,5,B008Y1YKU8,"A series that I had always read about and never had the opportunity to view. Hard to believe it is now fifty years ago,almost fifty one that this fine series was produced, and when I was born...A slew of amazing guest stars throughout the series and semi-regulars such as Richard Anderson, John Milford and to a lesser degree Christopher Connelly.
The feature version of To Kill A Man varies somewhat from the original episode. I watched them back to back and noticed that we have more depth of relationship between Rice and the James Shigeta character in the episode. The feature spends more time on Rice's relationship with Anne Helm and Linda Ho and although James Shigeta's character has some extra scenes which actually make sense, I  preferred the way they played out in the episode. Having said that, I recommend watching both together as they are fitting finale to this excellent series.",1388016000,,895,4.849673202614379
5189991,5,B008Y1YKU8,"This is essentially the same review I posted for Part 1.

ABOUT THE SERIES:  I watched this series when I was twelve years old.  I really liked the series Combat that began its run in 1962 when I was eleven.  I recall how different The Lieutenant was from ""war"" movies and television shows that I'd watched before.  This series, from my twelve year old perspective, was serious and seemed real.  I liked Gary Lockwood very much.  I also liked Robert Vaughn as the company commander.  He was definitely in command, but also seemed truly concerned about his men.

ABOUT THE PACKAGING AND DVDs:  The single-sided DVDs are well protected in the plastic case.  Don't look for any booklet or details on the individual episodes or any extras on the DVDs, except for the international release of the episode ""To Kill a Man"" in movie length.  The menu is simple and straight forward, but effective.  It does not appear that the episodes were remastered, but the quality is still very good.  I'm watching it on a 40"" LED Samsung HD and the picture appears pretty sharp and clear.

Since this is the first product I have owned on DVD-R media, I was concerned about how they would play.  So, this evening I placed each disc in my Sony Upscaling DVD Player (model DVP-NS710H/B) which I purchased new in 2010.  Each disc loaded.  I checked out the menus and scrolled through the options.  I played the beginning of two episodes on each disc.  They played fine.  I'll watch all the episodes in their entirety later.",1386374400,2,1500,4.6273764258555135
5189992,5,B008Y1YKU8,I enjoyed all of the episodes that make up the second DVD set.  I enjoyed seeing Ann Helms in the last episode.,1377129600,2,111,4.045454545454546
5189993,5,B008Y1YKU8,"I got this because I also own COMBAT series... and let me say, they don't make TV like that anymore!  For many, that's probably a good thing but for me... I like some of those old series.  They are entertaining... and I love watching shows where common sense rules.  There is no political correctness... a good series, I would recommend.",1368748800,,337,4.583333333333333
5189994,5,B008Y1YKU8,Worth it for the human factors alone. Society was more clear-eyed before liberal media fuddled us up. This is America with clear vision.,1360022400,,136,4.956521739130435
5189995,3,B008Y1YKU8,It was just O K. I did not realize it was a series.  I thought it was the complete movie at once.  My fault on this one.,1356739200,,120,3.4074074074074074
5189996,5,B008Y1YKU8,It is a shame this series only ran for one year. The quality of each episode is much higher then some of the more 'famous'  series  I saw these the first time around in 1963. They are just as impressive now. For those who have never seen any of these -give them a try. The quality of the discs and packaging is excellent.,1356566400,4,321,4.079365079365079
8532279,5,B008Y1YKU8,"Great series.  Of course no longer on TV, but would be neat to have it made again.",1528329600,,82,3.823529411764706
8532280,5,B008Y1YKU8,"This was an excellent show! And lots of Star Trek people, both main cast and guest stars, are in this. And of course, the main character was a guest  on the second pilot episode of STOS.",1526083200,,186,4.166666666666667
8532281,5,B008Y1YKU8,"I watched this series when I was a teenager.  Viewing it again after all these years has been a trip down memory lane.  The series is as good as I remember.  Gary Lockwood does an excellent job of portraying a Marine Lieutenant.  I grew up an Army brat, so I am well acquainted with military life.  The series is well acted and the characters are relatable.  I give it the top rating.",1523318400,,384,4.263888888888889
8532282,5,B008Y1YKU8,great old series on TV and well worth getting....acting is superb........,1511654400,,73,5.7272727272727275
8532283,5,B008Y1YKU8,"This series could arguably be compared to the more recent ""JAG"" series.  It follows the life of a young officer at Camp Pendleton, focusing not only on military situations, but personal as well.  Quite interesting that this was Gene Roddenberry's project immediately prior to Star Trek.  Also fun to see who the guest stars are in some of the episodes.  Many actors who became famous later on.",1496793600,,393,4.82089552238806

8532285,5,B008Y1YKU8,"Excellent DVDs for a top quality series that many have forgotten.  Though it is set in the 1963 -64 timeframe, the stories are timeless and are told only as a Gene Roddenberry production can.",1486425600,,191,4.617647058823529
8532286,5,B008Y1YKU8,Great show if you like B&W shows from the 50s.  This one written by the same guy who later went on to do Star Trek.  Interesting plots.  The film and audio is excellent.  Very well done.  I bought both DVD sets.  Nicely packaged too.,1481500800,,233,4.181818181818182
8532287,5,B008Y1YKU8,I enjoyed this hard-to-find TV program. It tells about the trials and travails of a freshly minted Marine officer during the immediate pre-Vietnam War era. I highly recommend it as a gift for  any former Marines.,1480982400,,212,4.888888888888889
