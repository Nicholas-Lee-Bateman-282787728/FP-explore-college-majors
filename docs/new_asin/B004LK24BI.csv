4401444,5,B004LK24BI,"I work a lot of hours, and have trouble getting to the gym as often as i'd like. This video has been a lifesaver because when i work late, i can still sqeeze in a great workout at home regardless of how much time i have to workout. It's broken up into individual segments that you can customize, so i like to mix em up so i won't get bored. If i'm pressed for time, i can do just cardio segments and 1/2 of the weight sections and still get a great workout in about 1/2 hour! with summer coming, i like to do outside cardio like running/swimming/biking, so i'll definitely reach for this video for the weight sections to help tone up. The moves are super easy to follow for uncoordinated people like me,but are not the same boring moves that are in every video. Some of the arm segments are my favorites of any i've done in classes or videos. i find myself doing them on my own when i do make it to the gym. Highly recommended!!!",1301875200,5,929,4.166666666666667
4401445,5,B004LK24BI,"This workout DVD has simple yet effective moves!  Easy to follow, yet challenging enough to get your heart rate up.
Afterall, that's what produces result right?

I like the count down clock, so you know that you can get through each segment.
I also like that you can customize the workout.  I go back and forth between weights, and cardio to get a well
rounded workout.

Great price too!  Highly recommend it to everyone!  Way to Go Angie!",1301529600,3,439,4.564102564102564
4401446,5,B004LK24BI,I am a 59 year old Grandma. I work 10 hour shifts so I am tired when I get home. I usually don't feel like doing an entire video so this video is perfect for me!  I can pick and choose which section I want to do and how intense I want to do it.  I love that it has different sections and I can do the entire video if I want or just pick sections that I want without having to fast forward to find what I want. And I like that you can get to the next section within seconds. I usually stick to Level 1 but can do Level 2 on some of them. It's easy to follow but it's a good work out for any age and level.  I highly recommend it.,1301529600,6,628,3.6029411764705883
4401447,5,B004LK24BI,"I am a new mom of an 8 week old, and finding the time to workout is difficult. But not fitting into my pre-pregnancy jeans is also difficult! haha!

This video is just what I need.
The video shows the 3 different levels of intensity. Since I am just starting to workout again, level 1 is working well for me. But I also do level 2 on certain portions of the video. It is nice to have all 3 on the same screen. And in having this DVD, I will also be able to move on to level 2 and 3 over the next few months.

It is awesome!!!
Definitely a must for the new moms, and anyone else wanting a great workout!!",1299801600,,603,3.894308943089431
4401448,5,B004LK24BI,"I am a working mom, and time to exercise is at a premium.  This video is divided into several segments, so you can do as much or as little as you want...this is a great feature for me.  The other night I popped it in while my husband gave our child a bath.  Before I knew it, my short workout with the level 3 exercises had me huffing and puffing like I had worked out for 45 minutes!  We all know that ""something"" is better than ""nothing"" and these shorter segments help you do shorter workouts without feeling like a failure for not doing the entire video.

Have more time?  You can customize your workout with as much cardio and/or weight training as you want...not only that, you can customize what level you are working at.  This video is truly a one size fits all that you will never outgrow.  It will work for everyone from brand new moms trying to get back into working out to a fitness buff that works out every day.

Angie is very motivating, and I would recommend this workout to anyone I know.  I would love to see more workouts from Angie Gorr!",1299801600,,1057,4.266331658291457
4401449,5,B004LK24BI,"This exercise video is amazing!  The first time I did it, I loved the three different levels that are shown.  If I felt like it was too much for me, I took it down a level and visa versa.  I love that I can push myself in my own basement and with little equipment.  Angie does a nice job of keeping you energized and excited for the next move.  I really like the timer at the bottom of the screen. It keeps me  motivated.  I highly recommend this video for busy people who want to get and stay fit.",1298160000,,498,3.9696969696969697
4401450,5,B004LK24BI,I am a Physical Therapist and Fitness Instructor myself and this is my FAVORITE DVD by far!  I love how Angie gives 3 levels of intensity (inlcuding a great alternative for low impact cardio which is a godsend to postpartum women or any woman with pelvic floor issues that still allows them to get their heart rate up safely).  Personally I love how the cardio is broken up into 4-6 minute segments meaning I never get bored and can get the recommended 25-30 min of cardio easily!  With the winter approaching this is a great way to get your cardio indoors---you won't be disappointed!,1350691200,,585,4.605769230769231
4401451,5,B004LK24BI,"This dvd is fun, challenging, user frienidly and gives you lots of flexibility in your workout. As with  Angie's ""Cardio and Strength"" dvd, which i also recommend, you can customize quickly what kind of workout you want, how hard and long you want to work and get your sweat on. You also may go back and forth among the three intensity levels for each and every section in the video.  The arm, ab and leg workouts, while seeming easy, will leave you  begging for it to end, and begging for more. The cardio section is terrific too.  The format of this DVD will keep you sweating, and your muscles guessing what's coming next for a very long time.  That translates into results.",1341100800,,677,4.516393442622951
4401452,5,B004LK24BI,"When I first put this dvd on, I thought my machine was freaking out because this girl has some serious energy! Her instructions are clear, and her 'tone' is encouraging without being too cheerleader-y...I hate that! There are variations to each exercise and I like that she encourages you to do which ever one you can do that day...some days are just easier to workout than others...and she gets that.
This is definitely one I pull out when I need some serious cardio. She uses weights as well but you don't have to if that is too much.",1330732800,,536,4.479591836734694
4401453,5,B004LK24BI,"This is a GREAT workout! Let me say, first, that Angie is TOTALLY LIKEABLE! I not only felt like I was part of the class, but I felt like I was working out with a friend. I hate when instructors give the 'tough talk', and act like pompous jerks, nothing makes a workout drag more than that. She has 3 different models, each doing a different level, and each level, you can clearly see form. The workouts are short, but effective. I work out 5 days a week, doing yoga, pilates, weights, and the treadmill, level 3 kept me challenged and a couple of times I had to drop down to level 2. I am not big on doing cardio on a video, but the weights portion ALONE is worth the purchase.",1327017600,,678,4.143939393939394
4401454,5,B004LK24BI,I love that you have so many different options with this video.  I can choose one or two cardio workouts with either lower body one day and upper body the next.  It doesn't take long to work up a sweat.  I like you can get a great workout in less than 15 minutes.  Can't wait to try the next one!,1321142400,,296,3.8833333333333333
4401455,5,B004LK24BI,This is an effective and easy-to-follow workout DVD that targets the whole body with cardio and weights. I love how it's broken down into sections which makes the workout go by fast and keeps it fun. There is a countdown clock for the sections which is a nice reminder of the progress you are making and also helps to keep you going. Angie's instructions are clear and she keeps you motivated throughout the whole DVD. Highly recommended!,1319414400,,438,4.701298701298701
4401456,5,B004LK24BI,"I've used many video workouts and have to say that Custom 3 Fit is one of the best.  The different levels of fitness, the explanantion of how the video works and the overaqll presentation and style makes you want to work out!!  You certainly get your heartrate going and best of all its FUN!!",1314748800,,292,4.388888888888889
4401457,5,B004LK24BI,"This video is my surprise hit of the year. I love that i can do my choice of 3 levels depending on the type of workout i want that day. Angie is sweet and offers great advice. The cardio is fun and easy to follow.. i do level 3 for the most part and get a great workout. the weight are high rep, low weight and you get a good burn. Looking forward to her new video...",1313107200,,367,3.779220779220779
4401458,5,B004LK24BI,"I have a lot of home exercise DVDs. This one doesn't have the high production value and budget behind it.  BUT, Angie understands how to give great cues and make a workout that is suitable for people of different fitness levels and with different physical challenges.  I'm flat footed with slight scoliosis and can't do tons of impact. It doesn't matter, I can follow level 1 or 2 on the cardio, listen to Angie's cues for making the cardio more intense at my level and get a great sweat. I also have a nagging tennis elbow injury that prevents me from lifting heavy weights.  I used 7, 5, 3, and 2 pound weights with the workout and have gotten some really nice muscle definition and tone.  I'm looking forward to Angie's next workouts as they get the job done and are enjoyable.",1310083200,,780,4.471830985915493
4401459,5,B004LK24BI,"I have tried so many workout videos in the past.  None of them is as good as Angie's.  I had the pleasure of working out with Angie and it was great fun! So, I bought her video to workout at home. I love the customization of the video, the cardio sections and the toning sections with weights. The video also shows the different levels of intensity, a beginner's, intermediate and advanced and this is great because you can do the workout at your own pace and at your own level of intensity. Angie also demonstrates the safelty measures to correctly follow the techniques in different sections of the work out. I love this workout video! Since I have started working out with Angie's workout video, I have toned my muscles and I am able to maintain my weight goal! I highly recommend Angie's video to others and I can't wait for her second video to come out!!",1309392000,,859,4.464968152866242
4401460,5,B004LK24BI,"This is a great workout video!! I love the customization of the video. The cardio section really gets your heart pumping. The video also shows the different levels of intensity by showing 3 different people doing a beginner's level, followed by intermediate and advanced. This is great because as your body gets used to one level, you can intensify your workout by doing the next level and so on. I also like that Angie has a safety portion to her video that demonstrates the correct way to squat, pick up your weights, etc. Angie made a great point about the common mistakes that are made and how to do those exercises correctly. I love this workout video and highly recommend it to others!!!",1309219200,,693,4.642276422764228
4401461,5,B004LK24BI,"I ordered my DVD and got it within a few days with zero issues!  I really like how you can pick a level to work out at... I had even broken my toe and could easily choose which workouts to do to avoid re-injury.  Then, after I was healed, I could do the entire workout but needed to work back up to ""level 3,"" so loved that I could tone it down to level 1 or 2.  I have done other workout videos, from Pilates to P90X, but what makes this one great is that it's not too mellow or too intense because YOU choose how hard you want to work!  A+!",1307836800,2,542,3.8125
4401462,5,B004LK24BI,"I love this DVD!!  Angie did a great job of breaking up the workouts into manageable segments of time.  I have a very demanding job and do a fair amount of travel - I take this DVD with me and can ALWAYS get a workout in - and a workout that actually works!  Angie leaves no room for excuses - I really like that she shows 3 levels so on the days I might be tired or less than eager to work out I can take it down to level 1 and still feel like I exercised.
She uses a variety of equipment - which I love, again, for my traveling I use bands when weights are not available.
I like that I can choose which cardio workout I want to pair with which toning section - very cool!
And I love that Angie is so encouraging - ""When you feel like you can't do any more push-ups, do just-one-more"" - YES!!
I love your ""live"" classes, Angie, and really appreciate all your hard work to put out this video.  When I can't be in class, I can take you with me; thanks!",1305072000,,951,3.911917098445596
4401463,5,B004LK24BI,"I enjoyed working out with the Custom3Fit DVD because it was fun and customizable.  Angie Gorr, the fitness instructor, did a great job leading the exercises.  She gives the right amount of motivation to get you through the tougher sessions.  This DVD is particularly unique for several reasons.  First, there are two different sections (Cardio & Weights) which are further broken down into several different workouts.  You can pick and choose which workout you want to do, whether it be all ""Cardio"" or all ""Weights"" or a little of both.  Second, the countdown timer is helpful in letting you know how much time is left before the end of the workout session.  Third, there are three different skill levels to follow.  Level one is beginner, level two is intermediate, and level three is advanced.  You can stay at level one throughout the entire workout or you can mix it up a little if you need more of an intense workout.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone, no matter what your fitness level is!",1304899200,,1012,4.731428571428571
4401464,5,B004LK24BI,"What an awesome aerobics video!!!

From the moment the video starts to the moment the video ends, Angie has you in constant motion.  She gives you the perfect blend of cardio and weight training.

I first started and thought my legs were going to fall off, but within minutes, I had undergone the perfect warm-up.  By the time the video was over, I felt as if I put an excellent workout to all of my muscles.

Awesome job, Angie!  You said in the begining of the video I was going to get in a work out.  Believe me, I definitely did!",1303862400,,533,4.217821782178218
4401465,5,B004LK24BI,When I first tried this workout video I was excited to see that I was able to burn just as many calories in an hour as I would at the gym!!  I was ambitious and tried out the whole video - it was worth it.  What kept me going was the timer on the bottom of the screen; having the segments broken down into 5 minute sessions helps you stay motivated to keep on going.  The examples of the three levels is also helpful.  For different sections I tried different levels and that also kept the video challenging yet within my limits.  This is a terrific video whether you have ten minutes or sixty.,1303430400,,594,4.175438596491228
4401466,5,B004LK24BI,"I love this dvd for a workout- you can do a custom workout of your own of any length or do the full hour - I did it the first time with 3-4 cardio rotations and did the abs, legs and arms. all at level 3... my abs still felt the workout two days later- love that! I highly recommend this video if you want someone to keep you  going and keep you from getting bored.",1303430400,,365,3.8026315789473686
4401467,5,B004LK24BI,"I am 50+ and loved this video---not to discourage those young, fit types who will also be challenged by Angie's routines.  I thought the different levels were extremely helpful, and Angie was positive and clear in her instructions. I would encourage all fitness levels to purchase this DVD.",1302739200,,290,5.041666666666667
4401468,5,B004LK24BI,"I have only had a chance to do the weights portion so far but hope to have time to try both soon, but the weights portion alone is a great workout.

I did Insanity last year and do several yoga videos and Jillian Michaels shred videos but overall this one has been the best in terms of actual muscle workout.

I enjoy (afterwards!) that Angie focuses on one muscle group at a time with several different exercises.  I don't lift as often as I should but I come away feeling I am getting more out of these upper body workouts using 5-10# weights than I do spending the same time at the gym with heavier weights and regular reps.

Most workouts I have tried switch things up a lot in between so you maybe do 30-60 seconds on a particular body part before it switches up.  Angie does 1-3 minutes on each without really letting up (but does give you the option to lower the weight or try an easier level to just make sure to keep form and finish the workout).  In particular the plank work and the bi/tricep workouts.

I enjoy plank work for core and the exercise she has you do is simple but effective.  I was so used to putting my leg down for a second rest between reps and constantly switching legs but this program never tells you to put the leg down (in levels 2 & 3) and works one side at a time, so you really feel it.

The opening punch sequence is pretty intense but when she focuses on the biceps and triceps you are doing them for 2-3 minutes with negative controlled lifts and pulses that really work the muscles the entire time.

I hope to try the entire workout sometime soon but I think this one has a lot to offer that differs from other workout videos and gym classes I have tried.",1302480000,5,1695,4.219814241486068
4401469,5,B004LK24BI,"I am a mother to a 7 year old and a very active 20 month old. As most moms out there you basically have no time to exercise as much as you would like to making everything right with the house, kids and other chores.  I found this video to be fantastic and I can fit it to my hectic schedule.  Each part is different and separate so you can pick what work out you want to do with how much time you have.  Another great option is a count down clock on the bottom of the screen which shows you how long you have to go so you won't give up and my favorite option is a 3 level work out from level 1 beginner to level 3 advance.  You can pick your own pace but as Angie recommends in the video ""push yourself"" keeps me motivated.
I highly recommend this video to any working mom or stay at home mom that just doesn't have time to do an hour of work out or just gave up on trying.",1302220800,,873,3.8333333333333335
8434453,2,B004LK24BI,This one definitely not for me!,1470096000,,31,4.333333333333333
8434454,3,B004LK24BI,"This DVD is about thirty minutes of cardio and then thirty minutes of weights. The cardio part is excellent. It's fast and challenging. Just be careful when transitioning to new moves. She moves quickly and nobody wants an injury...that I know of. It had some moves similar to Taebo, some kind of dancy, kickboxing stuff, but mostly she did her own thing, which kept it fresh.
The weight section is odd. It claims muscle groups are about to be worked and then exercises a completely different muscle group. It was strange. I'm not sure if it's just a lack of knowledge on her part, or a mistake when the DVD was being put together. I suspect it was the latter, because she designed a great and interesting cardio workout.
The other problem I had with the weight training part is that it was just too easy. I'm no bodybuilder, but I lift weights for an hour each session in the gym, so weights on home workout videos are often lacking for me, though not always. The weights portion seems geared more toward beginners and low intermediate while the cardio feels advanced. Heavier weights might help, but there just weren't enough repetitions or exercises on each muscle group to make it challenging.
Like I said, though, the cardio portion is great and will get your blood moving. It can be a challenge to find advanced cardio videos and this one delivered. While I won't be buying a weights only DVD of hers again since it doesn't fit my needs, I would definitely get another DVD of hers if it was just cardio or mostly cardio. She did a good job.",1433548800,,1546,4.544802867383512

I'm a bit disappointed with the weights segment. I prefer to have the option of heavy weight/low reps or low weight/high reps and it is not really possible with this DVD.",1389139200,,206,4.594594594594595
8434458,4,B004LK24BI,Great cardio and weight training.  Several modification options demonstrated.  Fun and challenging.  Bright set and upbeat music.  Pleasant instructor.

8434462,5,B004LK24BI,"This is a great workout video for those of us who aren't already exercise fanatics. Angie comes from a place of having an injury and having to get into exercising by taking it more slowly at first and working up to more. She emphasizes safety in this video and shows three different levels of intensity at the same time with her three assistants working out at the different levels at the same time, so you can watch this and adapt easily to what level you are most comfortable without feeling that you are being a wuss. Or you can workout with a partner who is at a different level than you are and you can both get a good workout from watching the same exact video. I've had knee replacement surgery, and, with Angie's emphasis on safety and with the enthusiasm in the video, I enjoyed doing this workout.",1355184000,,807,4.422818791946309
