stylized metal work and engraving and the influence it shared with calligraphers to be fascinating. Watch & enjoy!",1208304000,22,323,4.785714285714286
2568546,5,B000FII2NO,"This DVD takes you up close and personal. It's a guided tour much more personal than you could get if you were visiting the Book of Kells in person. The close up shots of the detail, together with historical details and comments by noted historians, make this DVD well worth the money. I rented it first at the library but I knew I'd want to watch it many times so I purchased it. If you are interested in Irish history and culture, this will be well worth the money.

2568547,5,B000FII2NO,"This past summer I was able to visit the exhibit on the Book of Kells in Dublin and I felt  overwhelmed at this amazing work of art and spirituality.  I wondered if something might bring home the rich world that opened to me in that experience - the brilliant, rich, deep treasure that we experienced.  I orderd this video hoping for something interesting.  And when I watched it I felt stunned... the music, the photogrphy, the ability to draw near to ""see"" the intricate figures and lettering, the artful way the film wove together the roots of the Book of Kells with the work itself... from swirling prehistoric rock art, to illuminated manuscripts that preceeded the Book of Kells, to intricate metalwork...  The transitions from other art forms to manuscript were  so seamlessly made that they virtually took you from one medium into the other.

The DVD  is exceptional in so many ways, and brings inspiration and insight for time after time viewing.
But be careful, once you have seen the DVD you may find it hard ot resist going to Dublin, Ireland to see the exhibit and a few pages of the book itself!

You may also want to see more, learn mor or or have material images to savor.  Bernard Meehan, Keeper of Maunscripts at Trinity College Dublin has created a wonderful, modestly priced and richly illustrated (110 color illlustrations) book that allows the reader to continue the delight and learning.  (ISBN 0-500-27790-7)

These experiences (DVD, exhibit, and book) took me from thinking of the Book of Kells as a peculiar aberration in the history of art to an experience of it's overwhelming beauty, the flower of rich roots which stretch across vast times and territories.",1189987200,80,1686,4.815972222222222
2568548,5,B000FII2NO,"This DVD is absolutely marvelous, and essential in describing and deciphering the Medievel marvels of the Book of Kells, also called ""the most beautiful book in the world."" Highly recommended, couldn't do without it. Had the slip-case book with color plates for over 30 years and loved looking at the pictures, but until I found this DVD I never understood any of it.

The DVD has become a ""Rosetta Stone"" of sorts for me and for everyone that watches it. I sent a copy of both the book and the DVD to my beloved Irish 5th grade teacher, and she invited all of her friends over to have a ""DVD watching party"" and enjoy both the book and the DVD.

The other essential companion for all things Celtic is ""Ireland's Treasures: 5000 Years of Artistic Expression""  by Peter Harbison. Priced very well on Amazon.",1182384000,37,806,4.583333333333333
