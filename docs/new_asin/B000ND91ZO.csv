8176719,5,B000ND91ZO,"Thanks to Jayasri Hart for telling this very important story that would have been lost to the ages.

8176721,5,B000ND91ZO,"Great documentary for Black history month, women's history month, you name it.  It's just wonderful.  The movie is not about the entire Civil Rights Movement.  It's focuses instead on the Civil Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama.  At the end, it focuses on the changes that women religious or nuns have gone through since the 1960s.  I love women religious.",1352160000,,356,4.966101694915254
8176722,5,B000ND91ZO,"This documentary captures for all time the compelling courage of those individuals who would burst the social or institutional restrictions of their lives to stand up for what is right. The original 6 Catholic nuns (and those who followed them) burst through the images, perceptions, and biases of their own church members (and others) to take a stand against the dehumanization and moral objectification that is the foundation of racism and every form of human oppression. Racism is far from dead. Turning people into ""objects"" is alive and well. We do it in race relations. We do it between women and men. We do it between those who supposedly have power and those who do not. In short, culture too often is built upon domination, power and hatred --- all of which have fear at their very roots. This film calls all this into question. Its message it not just about things that occurred in 1965. Its message is for all time. I certainly hope that this film does not go ""out of print"" so to speak. That would be a shame and a scandal. Its message is far too important especially in today's world where we value ""metrics of productivity"" more than ""the merits of human substance and goodness."" This is a film that teaches all of us that compassion is far from weak. Compassion is that form of ""suffering with"" that stands up, boldly says ""no"" to oppressors, and just as boldly says ""yes"" to every form of respect for human dignity, and the right of all persons to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.",1333411200,,1507,4.626865671641791
8176723,5,B000ND91ZO,"I am working on a doctoral dissertation that is dealing with women's engagement of patriarchal structures; in particular the ways that Catholic nuns interacted with the hierarchy of the Church during the 1960's.  As I watched this DVD, I was taken back to those turbulent times and remember watching live news coverage of the Selma marches.  If you were alive during those times, this DVD will re-inspire you to the call of activism to fight injustice.  If you were not yet born, this DVD will tell you the story of how peaceful interventions, determination, and collaboration among a diversity of people was possible and continues to be possible.  This DVD has helped me reflect on how we need to rethink history ... to look at visual memories of people standing up to oppression, especially the Catholic sisters who broke their silence, I am encouraged that social change is a possibility.",1206662400,4,891,4.92
