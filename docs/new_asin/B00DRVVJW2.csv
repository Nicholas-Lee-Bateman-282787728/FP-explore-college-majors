8596909,5,B00DRVVJW2,"An epic indie fantasy, this film takes place in the world of Paladin: Dawn of the Dragonslayer. It's a thrilling adventure from start to finish. The action sequences are incredible, especially the climactic confrontation with the monster on the sea cliffs.  The real heart of the story, though, is the relationship between Elenn and Aedin. The dance from antagonism to friendship to romance is superbly depicted by Amy De Bhr&uacute;n and David Haydn. Also excellent is Tim Treloar, who brings a sinister gravity to the villanous Magister Corvus.

It's a great movie, which hopefully will find the acclaim and the audience it deserves. Give it a try!",1379030400,,650,5.065420560747664
