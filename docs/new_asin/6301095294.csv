I had this film on VHS but with this DVD copy I appreciate the sharp contrast and colors even more. Even more I was impressed with the special features portion of the deleted scenes, alternate videos, and a Traffic video not used in the final film. Don't forget the interviews with Sir Paul and Ringo.

312048,5,6301095294,Always a Beatle fan.  I've never heard the sound as good as this soundtrack.  They should do all their albums in 5.1 or whatever the next big thing is.  The 4K cleanup shows details never seen before because of all the grain they eradicated.  I really enjoyed the bonus scenes they left out of the original movie.  You think people were different back then but they are just as funny as today especially the backstories on all the actors they hired to make this masterpiece.  Paul McCartney was ahead of his time.  You could tell he thought everything fit however strange plus the other Beatles had a lot of input and had fun doing it.  It took a while to get here but was worth the wait coming all the way from England.,1504742400,2,720,4.360902255639098

312078,4,6301095294,"A lifelong Beatle fanatic, I had never seen the actual TV special.  I had heard it was not very good, so I was prepared for the worst.  And it was not very good, lol.

If you aren't a Beatle fan or a fan of poorly executed ideas, skip this and listen to the sound track. It's really hard to watch.  If you are a Beatle fan, then you have to watch it just because there's so little footage of them from this era.  You do get to see John and George in off the cuff moments, just playing along with the lark.  I got the feeling that Paul always knew he was being filmed and Ringo was actually acting a role.

The pity of this is that were some very good ideas here.  The premise itself would have been comedy gold with an actual script.  Or if they had more interesting people on the bus.

Just imagine Chris Guest, Harry Shearer, etc with this premise, it could have been a riot.

You can also see seeds of some Monty Python (dining scene, army scene) and Harry Potter (tents) bits here.

The very best part is the music (except blue jay way--ugh!).  Fool on the Hill, I am the Walrus and the finale of Your Mother Should Know are top notch.

I'm glad I watched it for completeness sake, but I don't think I'll watch it again.",1494201600,4,1224,4.13135593220339

312128,4,6301095294,"The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein passed away on August 27, 1967.  A month later, under the direction of Paul McCartney, the Beatles filmed ""Magical Mystery Tour.""  The 52-minute film was first broadcast on BBC1, in black-and-white, on December 26, 1967.  The improvised, stream-of-consciousness dialog and meandering plot didn't go over well with the British viewing public.  Nearly fifty years after its initial release, ""Magical Mystery Tour"" offers a unique look into the personal eccentricities of Misters Harrison, Lennon, McCartney and Starr.  The 2012 DVD restoration is excellent; the colors are vibrant, the video quality is very good, and the audio remastering is exceptional.  Whether you like the pythonic humor of the action, or dislike the self-indulgent silliness of the plot, depends on the point of view of the viewer.  The real treasures of the film are the musical performances, which I will rate individually.

""Magical Mystery Tour"" - The opening number is a classic song, and sets the tone for what is to follow. (A+)
""The Fool On The Hill"" - It's a magnificent McCartney song, and should have been a hit single. (A+)
""Flying"" - It's an undistinguished instrumental, only noteworthy for having been written by all four Beatles. (C)
""I Am The Walrus"" - It's a bizarre Lennon masterpiece, nicely complimented by the surrealistic action swirling around its performance. (A)
""Blue Jay Way"" - It's George Harrison's psychedelic song, with touches of Indian classical music.  (C+)
""Your Mother Should Know"" - Written by Paul McCartney, it's a British Music Hall ballad, with a memorable melody. (B+)
""Magical Mystery Tour"" (reprise) and ""Hello, Goodbye"" (finale played over end credits) get an incomplete rating.

The bonus features include a making of the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" documentary, a brief overview of the supporting cast, versions of ""The Fool On The Hill,"" ""Blue Jay Way"" and ""Your Mother Should Know"" that include footage not shown in the original film, and a complete promotional video version of ""Hello, Goodbye.""  While not everyone's cup of tea, ""Magical Mystery Tour"" includes enough performances of Beatles' songs to make it well worth purchasing.",1486425600,14,2185,5.268011527377522

312131,4,6301095294,"Fans at the time would have happily overlooked the fact that this film came out originally in black and white, and was ""different"". Their main focus, of course, was the new batch of Beatle songs. Those songs were like magic puddings that pushed the frontiers of pop experimentation and creativity.
Magical Mystery Tour was released in late 1967, seemingly a time of promise for a new age of freedom and surrealism in pop culture and perhaps in the wider culture as well. However, that promise quickly dissipated when the rock and roll revival hit town, delivered  by the Beatles themselves with the release of ""Lady Madonna"" in early 1968, while John Lennon dug up Little Richard and Chuck Berry, and dragged their bodies around a concert stage in Canada. The subsequent ""White Album"" had a few experimental songs, but these were mainly afterthoughts.
In respect to this cinema verite, the inexplicable appearance of the ""Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band"" apparently had something to do with a sick running joke about Paul McCartney having died in a car wreck. ""Death Cab For Cutie"", the Walrus, and a black carnation were the clues. Pay close attention to the truly disturbing face masks the bonzo bandsmen sporadically wear.
 In reality, McCartney didn't die in a car wreck. His car wreck came a few years after the Beatle split when he emerged from a ""Withnail and I"" scenario and formed the band ""Wings"", where he came to follow trends (like a canny businessman) rather than set them.
In the broader cultural context, the ""rock and roll revival"" was a political backlash delivered by more mysterious parties, and it constituted a betrayal of the future, which, in turn, caused people to long for a past that could never return.
Now, the magic is no more. All that remains is the business transaction.",1485388800,2,1794,4.840390879478828

312189,2,6301095294,"A few notes about this film:
Magical Mystery Tour was meant to be a TV special for British audiences only, which was broadcast on Boxing Day (December 26th) in 1967. It was intended to be a gift by The Beatles to their home country; there were no plans for it to be shown anywhere outside of the UK. And for a long time, that's how it turned out ...
Although the film was shot in color, there were only 200,000 color TVs in Great Britain, and its initial broadcast on BBC1 was, therefore, in black and white - and it looked horrible. It was re-broadcast in color a few days later on BBC2, but to an obviously limited audience. But it wasn't the format that was the problem - it was the film itself: I finally got to see it during a theatrical release in the mid-'70s, and about the only thing that was good about that showing was the specialized sound equipment in the theater used to play the songs - the sound of the film's dialogue was another animal entirely. It was about as muddy as a cheap cassette recorder of that era (trust me, not good), and I couldn't tell you what anyone said from beginning to end.  Bottom line: this film was a dog, and even the Bonzo Dog (Doo-Dah) Band's performance of ""Death Cab for Cutie"" couldn't save it. It was the first release that caused The Beatles to issue an apology to those subjected to the broadcast.
Now, as to the Magical Mystery Tour ALBUM:
This one was amazing for a couple of reasons - first, Sgt. Pepper was still selling extremely well, and had that album been released today, you wouldn't have seen another Beatles album for at least three years. But out comes this record almost six months later, and they swapped places back and forth for the #1 and #2 position on the charts at the end of 1967 and beginning of 1968.  As a 14 year-old at the time, all of us aspiring garage band members were wondering how they would top an album like Sgt. Pepper, and we found out in record time!  If you didn't have the TV special to get in the way, you were blown away - I know I certainly was.

So now you must ask yourself: do I buy this thing or not?
Well, if you need to have it in your collection, hold out for the Blu-Ray edition. While there is so much that can be done with a film originally shot in 16mm, it's as good as you're ever gonna get.  But before you put it on, you need to realize that, above all, this film started out its life as a dog.",1476403200,,2402,4.2017353579175705
312190,5,6301095294,"It's taken a long time for this shaggy dog of a film to be properly appreciated, because like so many shaggy dogs, it's messy, running in all directions at once, shedding on the furniture -- but enough overdrawn simile. It's also friendly, loveable, goofy, and an all-around delight. Essentially a long home movie from the end of the Summer of Love, the boys are having fun in a proto-Pythonesque way, the viewers are getting some wonderful songs (proto-music videos, really) & a torrent of surreal imagery, and the make-it-up-as-you-go spirit of the 1960s is very much alive & well every step of the way. Add to that the generous extras on the disc, and you've got a splendid trip with no bad side effects -- but only if you enter into it without any expectations of professional, plotted filmmaking. It wasn't made for the critical eye, but for the imagination. Just sit back & let it take you away!",1473811200,7,901,4.672955974842767

Really only half of the Magical Mystery Tour album... additional reason for the slam is used for the movie.  TO ME the main reason to own this is for I am the Walrus... sounds fantastic, reason I bought it but hard to justify for the price for one song.  The other songs sound great but not really stand out Beatles tunes remember half of the album - all OK tunes, I like them but not killer stuff.  To get those you would have to go to 1+ which looks and sounds great but two pricey buys to get all the tunes on the album on blu-ray so another ding.  Another thing I'm not happy about is you can't just play just the tunes... duh what is the technology for.  They do include Hello Goodbye (complete) in the bonus.  Tough call.  as I said for sound, what's there, it's be best sound you're going to get... if that's important to you.  5 stars for the walrus but 3 stars for the whole as entertainment, with I actually think is two stars (most of it sucks) but I'll go with It's OK... the sound is nice. i am the walrus koo koo kachoo",1471046400,,1108,4.15962441314554

312271,3,6301095294,"What is it?

Experimental, self-indulgent, musical fantasia.

Artists portraits and self-portraits do not necessarily always work. Picasso did it right in Le Mystere Picasso.
Dali, not so well in his late (decades after the Bunuel collaborations,) experimental, home movie style, Happenings. In one he and Gala come out of an egg, spilling milk and blood. In another one Dali attempted to paint the inside of a plastic bubble, only to have the paint not cooperate with the slick inner surface, and with Dali just splashing paint around in frustration.

The Beatles (and post) tried it a few times, as late as Give My Regards To Broadstreet, earlier in Draculas Son, but the earliest is this effort, filmed independently and broadcast in Boxing Day by the BBC. It is much of the same.

It is claimed that the film was for the most part improvised, and it shows. There is also a blatant lack of chemistry between the players. Ringo and his Aunt never connect. The Aunt and her winter affair gentleman (Mr Bloodclot, or whatever) seems most uncomfortable in their caresses and kisses.

And where we expect to have chemistry and warmth, in the scenes with the four Beatles together they seem at a loss on what to do or say. Their scenes are ill put together and are absolutely pointless. What is the point of the four Wizards?

George just seems embarrassed by it all, mostly hiding under a giant hat or behind dark shades.

I like the album, I like the individual songs, but the film fails to jell for much of its length (at 60 minutes its pretty hard for it to overstay its welcome.) Best approached as a proto music-video compilation, its music segments nevertheless pale in comparison with the modern edits of those same songs.

The one song that works, in my estimation, is Flying, a non-sequitur sequence that takes us into an unexpected space. Would only the rest of the film be able to achieve something close to this.

The problem is therefore not its obscurity or attempts at being avant garde, it is its missdirected (or lack thereof) self indulgent nature.

The non music skits feel much like the worst of the Monty Python skits or at the point where they have gone off the rails and require the knight with the dead chicken to come in and end it once and for all.

In one of the skits, a greasy John Lennon looks much like a pencil mustachioed Eric Idle at his most unctuous. As a further almost Python connection we also get a performance of Death Cab for Cutie from the The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.

Being as I was about 11 and this was punk times, I actually had to ask him what mono was and which point he frowned and ignored me.
So I didn't buy it.

X Million years later, after I've forgotten to buy the box on release, I find it at a bargain price here on Amazon.
And I have to say that if, like me, you're wondering whether this is a 'worth it' item, then be assured that it's pure class from the magnetic snap-to lock (which may initially leave you wondering how to open it but is part of the pleasure!) to the detailed new book by Barry Miles.
I haven't yet inspected BluRay anything but even the DVD here is 'Gasp!'
Magical Mystery Tour as a film has had a tiny audience relative to the rest of The Beatles work. So much so that in Britain where it's been shown on television only a handful of times since 1967, it had become an obscurity that was remembered as still-frames rather than as a film.
This set shows why, despite this, the film had an influence way beyond its viewing figures and critical panning. Martin Scorcese is here explaining why it was important and Terry Gilliam is here (not quite) admitting that Monty Python took a lot of its cues from it.

Personally I was so astonished by the improved colour and incredible sound that I sat right close up to the television so that it would fill my view and in that respect I returned to being the kid who tried to buy that EP.",1442534400,2,1668,4.2421383647798745

In Fool on the Hill, most of the action consists of closeups of Paul's face while he rolls his eyes.

The music comes out at you with glorious definition and impact. I can't wait for the The Beatles to remaster their catalog to, I hope, 192 kHz 24 bit. Please correct me if I am wrong, but this Bluray offers the first wave of high resolution Beatles music. The other blurays- Help, Hard Days Night and Yellow Submarine are all 48 khz, 24 bit.

I am wondering if the producers of this Bluray knew to make this Bluray special, they needed to concentrate on the music (because the movie is universally panned), hence I believe a thorough remastering occurred.

The original idea for the Mystery Tour was Paul McCartney's. He and Jane Asher celebrated her 21st birthday by flying to San Francisco, where Paul hung out with members of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jefferson-Airplane/dp/B007PV9DNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jefferson Airplane</a>.

These supposedly random day coach trips into the country invariably ended up at the seaside resort of Blackpool.

No room here to dissect all its scenes, yet some are worth a mention.
Video for ""I Am the Walrus"" was shot at an abandoned US Air Force base. The concrete obelisks we see bobbies standing on were put there to deflect bomb blasts.

An improvised beach love scene to an instrumental ""All My Loving"" between Ivor Cutler (Buster Bloodvessel) and Jesse Robins (Ringo's aunt) was axed from the original broadcast by an uptight BBC exec who feared it would offend the obese and elderly. It was later reinstated.

Although MMT was credited as a Beatles project, it was essentially Paul who made it happen. At the time, John Lennon was heavily into heroin and LSD, so beyond the realization of a dream he'd had of being a Brylcreem-haired waiter shoveling spaghetti on a fat woman's plate, John had little to offer in the way of plot. George and Ringo may have been agreeable to the film but neither were active in scene planning, so McCartney  (and Mal Evans) carried the load.

The actors and others riding on this picture's bus were told at the start that everything, including dialogue was ad lib. This made some uneasy. One old vaudevillian named Nat Jackley (as the eccentric-walking Rubber Man) hated the way he looked in this film and became one of its loudest critics. But Jackley's potshots weren't necessary, as MMT was destined for inglory.

After its completion and sale to the BBC for a paltry 9,000, Paul's wish that MMT air on Boxing Day night (Dec. 26th) was granted. Because it was shown in b&w, the film lost much of its power, and its target audience, Britain's youth may have been elsewhere that night. Older generations naturally couldn't understand it and MMT was roundly dismissed. Even a Jan. 5th full color rerun didn't help, as color TVs had only been available for six months and few homes had them.

Poorly as it did in the UK, presented in American theaters as a short movie, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR found an appreciative audience. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/US-record-album/dp/B0057H2N2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">US record album</a>, with four additional songs, was a big hit.

312338,1,6301095294,"Yes, it's The Beatles. Yes, the songs are timeless classics. But, why do I give this DVD the lowest possible rating? Because I am reviewing the film, and it is the complete opposite of what the music is. It lacks any plot, any character we - the audience - may want to like, or even follow along. What the movie ends up being is a tax write off of the most humiliating kind. By the time the film was made, The Beatles had recorded and sold millions of records worldwide, but with the untimely death of their incompetent manager Brian Epstein due to a drug overdose, the band found themselves without a guardian. Paul McCartney, reluctantly took the reins as Ringo was clueless, George's head was into religion and uncommercial Eastern music, and John was not only incompetent, but an unreliable business partner who couldn't care less about anything. Finding themselves as orphans in the inhuman world of the British music business, they decided to follow Paul's good intentioned but naive and inept idea of making a movie about ""anything that happened in a magical ride on a bus"". They really should have hired the services of professional American (not British) - filmmakers and screenwriters as the ""Old boy Victorian simpatico English"" stereotype just ran thin and out of steam by the first 5 minutes of the movie. The BBC broadcast it in black & white in 1967 - and though defenders of the film argue that the essence of the film was lost as it was made in color - the truth is that this is like watching a slaughterhouse of talent and money, bleeding all over and feeling sad, pitiful and impotent at not being able to find one single thing about the work that could be its saving grace. Yes, it's The Beatles, but after watching the filma few times over the course of the past 20 years, I still cringe at just how awful this is. And I feel very sad for the band as they were really trying to please the audience, and failed miserably. Just buy the record or the CD and be happy with it. If yo must see the film, search it out for free in the internet, and you'll save the $20-.

In the movie, the Beatles decided to hire a psychedelic bus, take a trip into the English countryside, and film the results, no matter how bizarre or boring. With a motley cast of characters, the group basically tramps about the landscape with occasional music cues to give the film a bit of flow.

This is definitely a must-see for Beatles buffs and anyone interested in how the '60s looked as they were happening.

In addition to that, a BlueRay and DVD with the film and bonus material is for me, an extra, as I was first an foremost looking for the EP. Now, in my mind, this should be pat of the original Beatles reissues instead og the American MMT LP, and rather put the extra songs (Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, All You You Need Is Love etc) on the Past Masters album. That would make the Past Mastars more complete too. The current Past Masters jumps from Rain (1966) and straight into the lap of Lady Madonna (1968); i.e. nothing from 1967. This makes it a strange and incomplete singles cronology.
Anyway, this reissue looks, as far as I can see, very much like the original 1967 one, but with 2009 instead of 1967 written on the records, and ""Printed in the USA"", which it obviously was not back then. These things do not matter. Also, it plays great, sounds great and so forth. In  mono, which it was back then also. Maybe both, I am not sure.
My package has two holes in the back, all the way through the back of the outer MMT box, not leaving any damage to the DVD/BR, book nor the great double EP.

The Beatles were on drugs (MJ, LSD, etc.) during this time. And I think this movie shows an attempt to convey what was in their newly opened minds, to us.

313090,5,6301095294,"This review is for the ""Magical Mystery Tour Deluxe Box Set (Blu-ray/DVD/double-vinyl EP)"" Edition

First off, if you have never seen Magical Mystery Tour, it's going to take a couple of viewings to digest it all. Don't look for a plot or a purpose, just sit back and enjoy the ride through the English countryside while watching The Beatles basically invent what would become known as a Music Video. From ""The Fool On The Hill"" to ""Blue Jay Way"" you'll be amazed at how the images and the music come together so well. Until of course you get to the ""I Am The Walrus"" sequence, then your mind will officially be blown.

Next, on to the set itself: It's absolutely stunning and packed with extras. Not only do you get the Blu-Ray and DVD, but a high quality full color book with production info, on-set photos, notes and text from Paul McCartney and much more. Then there's the double-vinyl EP set, faithfully reproduced just like the original complete with the attached booklet, pressed on high quality vinyl 45rpm records!! There's even another little surprise in the box that I'll keep a secret because it's THAT awesome. Real care and passion was taken into making this set, and it shows. This is all boxed in a high-quality, high-gloss box with a magnetic closure. An absolutely amazing package!!

If you know someone who is a Beatles fanatic, they will love the deluxe box set.",1407628800,2,1382,4.702479338842975
313091,5,6301095294,"Everything you expect to find in a Beatles deluxe release. I do think there could be more extras, but overall I'm happy with the ones included here, as well as I am with the packaging, the book, the photos and even the film restoration, which is not perfect, but well better than the pirate copy I had. Just beware of the EPs: they sound really bad. I don't know if they were trying to make them exactly like the original ones released in 1967, but, if they were, they managed to because their sound quality is low (besides being in mono) and they play too fast, even in the recommended speed (45 rpm).",1407542400,,602,4.336283185840708

313142,5,6301095294,"By late 1967, the Beatles had conquered the music landscape like nobody had ever done before. For Christmas in the U.K., they offered a special television film called ""Magical Mystery Tour"", which aired on Boxing day. This VHS reissue of the film is superior in every way. In addition to having the movie itself on the videotape, it has now been completely resequenced and reimagined in a slightly different running order. All of the songs are now in their very best presentations. Even better is the inclusion of every 1967 promo song film for the remaining selections that were released on the American album. These clips are now brilliantly incorporated within the framework of the film, thus making this version the most definitive presentation ever made available for public viewing. The additional songs are ""Penny Lane"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""All You Need Is Love"", ""Baby, You're A Rich Man"" and ""Hello, Goodbye"". Even the song ""A Day In The Life"", which was not featured in ""Magical Mystery Tour"" is also part of this program. By adding these extra tracks into the film, what you have here is the most essential version of the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" film from 1967 ever released. It is almost like having a video companion of the album, ready to watch on your home screen. The extra song clips actually make this film a much better presentation. satisfaction guaranteed!",1404950400,,1386,4.952789699570816

Don't try to read too much into it but let the imagery flow  over you when you just need a break and something to unwind and or share with others.,1403395200,,362,3.9178082191780823

313179,5,6301095294,"If you are a die hard Beatles fan you will like this film. There are many funny scenes, especially for John Lennon fans. Check out the scene of John interacting with the little girl on the bus or the scene where he is shoveling the spaghetti onto the big lady's plate. Hilarious moments. Plus, he narrates the film and you get a live video of I Am The Walrus. Overall, not as good as Help! or A Hard Day's Night but still essential for Beatles nuts.",1402704000,,449,4.232558139534884
313180,3,6301095294,"I had always been annoyed by the perennial question, ""The Beatles or the Rolling Stones?"" The debate is, to quote Herman Cain, ""apples and oranges."" Both groups exemplify rebellion - for the Stones, it's sex, and for the Beatles, drugs. Despite the screaming teeny-boppers at their concerts, the ""late"" Beatles were almost sexless, like preadolescents. One scene in Magical Mystery Tour involves a visit to a strip club, and the ""boys"" are quiet, wide-eyed, in awe, as most little boys would be in that setting. Mick Jagger would have at least climbed onto the stage for a little frottage with the dancer. This scene also provided the explanation for the name ""Death Cab for Cutie.""

The other difference is that the Stones were primarily musicians, while The Beatles were an entire entertainment package. Maybe a film like Magical Mystery Tour is little more than a historical oddity now, not aging as well as the music, but at the time of its release, it was the only opportunity for visual contact with the band members, as they had ceased touring by that time.

The film is described as an extended music video, barely held together by the frame of a bus trip. The scenes deliberately defy explanation - you are looking at it the wrong way if you expect to figure it out. You're not supposed to figure anything out. The ""four or five magicians"" are played by the Fab Four - we get it, they are the magicians bringing us the Magical Mystery Tour. Like in A Hard Day's Night, Ringo is accompanied by an odd family member, in this case, his Aunt Jessie, who in one scene is shown dreaming of being served mountains of spaghetti by a waiter wielding a shovel (although she does not actually eat any of it). The scene with the shrieking, babbling Army officer is a parody of military behavior, heavy-handed, but at the time, probably new and daring.

The DVD seems to be little more than a direct transfer from VHS, with scenes and credits added. It would have been immensely improved by subtitles, a little video remastering and color correction, and maybe some short segments with the surviving Beatles, Paul and Ringo, discussing the film. For a teenager of today, the same age I was when I first heard the Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour would not be the best introduction to them. The music seems to defy definition, virtually embodying its own unique genre. But the images are almost those of a lost world, as remote as grainy films of 1920s flappers, an anthropological record of a party that ended a long time ago.",1402617600,,2519,4.6945701357466065
313181,5,6301095294,"If you are a Beatle nut you MUST get your hands on this, simply as that; this is not for your average pop fan, this is pure and raw trippy fab four psychedelic, furry-ass walrus awesomeness. The packaging is just superb, the box opens from the right-hand side and snaps neatly onto a magnetic flap, once inside you get a Magical Mystery Tour ticket, the big book with new photos, which could perfectly be worth the price alone (I managed to get the whole package new for 20 bucks), then below a small gatefold cardboard with the DVD and Blu-ray discs, which by the way, the Blu-ray comes as an all regions disc, I was concerned about it being region limited; and then finally you get the awesome 24-page book you'd get on the LP but shrinked into EP size, with a vinyl on the cover and back, which are reproductions of the original UK Parlophone pressings, they're on remastered mono sound; it's actually interesting for me to own these mono EP's since honestly if you are a Beatles fan you own a billion versions of the stereo mixes, so what gives?

In some cases, this is true, but not here.  Sound is improved as well.  As far as content is concerned,...  Well, it's Magical Mystery Tour.  It's The Beatles in post Sgt. Pepper 1967, experimenting with cameras, costumes, and a rag-tag group of tourists out in the country for a day.  Elaborate home movies?  Yeah, but memorable.  Some of the characters are kind of annoying in the skit parts of the movie, but the musical parts more than make up for that.  Easily, the forerunner of concept/abstract videos that later occupied MTV back when it had music videos on it.

Book: Very resourceful and helpful in learning about the production of the Magical Mystery Tour movie
DVD/Blu Ray: Contains the movie. Great movie
EPs- This is why I wanted it. The replicas are awesome and a good listen. Here are the songs:
Magical Mystery Tour: Catchy song that sticks in your brain.
Flying: Most people hate this song, but personally its a relaxing instrumental
I am the Walrus: My favorite song in this. Doesn't need an explanation of why it's good.
Your Mother Should Know: Probally my least favorite, but still it's a catchy song
The Fool on the Hill: Good song with interesting lyrics describing... well a fool
Blue Jay Way: One of my favorite Harrison songs. His voice is soothing and the lyrics are easy to remember.

313394,5,6301095294,"I often feel The Beatles' ""Magical Mystery Tour"" film has been treated rather unfairly by critics in the past. Of course, you might sense a hint of bias on my part because I'm such an enormous fan of the Beatles, but I genuinely think the film has a lot to offer if approached the right way.

The film was made for television in September 1967 and shown on BBC1 on Boxing Day evening that year. It was meant to be a colour extravaganza but the BBC broadcast it in black and white so even the 200,000 or so people with colour TV receivers in Britain at the time would not have been able to watch it as it was intended to be presented. Therefore, the aerial views shot over Iceland that were used for the ""Flying"" instrumental sequence would have been lost on initial viewers. Even so, that wouldn't have been enough for critics and viewers alike to pan the production. I suppose it was pretty far out and not at all what people were expecting, especially for festive period viewing from the biggest band in the world with whom they associated the stuff of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help!"" when it came to Beatles' films.

The Beatles (particularly Paul) had been experimenting with making home movies and from this grew the idea for making ""Magical Mystery Tour"". The group's manager, Brian Epstein had just died and, as the story goes, Paul came up with the project as a means to keep the band actively involved with one another at a time when Epstein's death could have splintered them. They had stopped touring and had only recently released an album (""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"") and single (""All You Need Is Love""), so the idea of doing a television film was, perhaps, the best direction.

Some fans and music critics like to blame Paul for the Beatles' failings after Brian died. Indeed, John Lennon did so himself later on, accusing Paul of keeping the band going for his (Paul's) own sake. Perhaps there's some truth in that but I don't think Paul was being entirely selfish. The Beatles were still a band and, therefore, still had a job to do. Paul was always prolific when it came to writing music and coming up with ideas and I think he was just excited and keen to run these by the group and commit them to tape. John might have later complained about Paul always being the one to call the other three band members up and saying it was time to make another record, but if he hadn't then the other three would have just sat around being unproductive. Thus, Paul became the driving force in the band's later years and was almost forced to take charge after Brian died just so as to get things done. Paul often gets the blame for ""Magical Mystery Tour"" but don't forget George, Ringo and John all happily went along with it and made their own contributions. If they didn't like it they could have always vetoed the idea.

I first saw ""Magical Mystery Tour"" in 1992 when I bought a copy of it on VHS video tape from the local supermarket in Withington. My dad bought my mum a Betamax video recorder for Christmas in 1984 and by '92 it had breathed its last. He replaced it with a VHS video player but when we installed it we found, for some odd reason, that it would only play video tapes in black and white. I find it pleasingly ironic that my very first viewing of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" was colourless, just like the people who originally tuned in to watch it on the television 25 years earlier. Dad took the video recorder back to the store to get a replacement and I was then able to rewatch ""Magical Mystery Tour"" in colour. Unlike the viewers' anticipating its original broadcast in 1967, I had the benefit of watching the film for the first time knowing that it had not been well-received and had been saddled with a bad reputation for all these years. In other words, my expectations were allowed not to be high but I was still extremely excited to see 53 minutes of footage of the Beatles that I had never seen before but had only heard about. I could, and still can, understand how people would have been disappointed with the nonsensical aspect of it all, especially as there was no plot. The film consisted of segments, often very surreal ones, which had seemingly been `thrown' together. Indeed, most of it was improvised. Having said that, I love the ""marathon"" chase around the airfield in Kent and I think Victor Spinetti's incomprehensible army drill sergeant is brilliantly hilarious and the best of his three performances in the Beatles' films. Just as funny are the scenes between Ringo and his Aunt Jessie, played by Jessie Robins and I love the nighttime sharabang scenes where everyone's drinking and singing songs to an accordion accompaniment. Derek Royle and Ivor Cutler are terrific as Jolly Jimmy and Buster Bloodvessel respectively, and I wish the John Lennon-directed ""Nat's Dream"" scene of Nat Jackley as Happy Nat The Rubber Man chasing women around the Atlantic Hotel's outdoor swimming pool has been kept in the movie as it's a great little sequence, I think. It is included as a deleted scene on this 2012 DVD release of the film.

The one thing I haven't yet mentioned about ""Magical Mystery Tour"" is perhaps the most important thing of all - the music. The six new Beatles' tracks featured in the film that formed the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" double EP are all wonderful and the film serves as a means of providing six little ""music videos"" for each of them. I've never been very keen on Paul's ""Fool on the Hill"", I have to admit, but I can appreciate its merit and why it's one of his most popular songs. The footage of him in France that was shot for the song's inclusion in the film is beautiful. Likewise, George's ""Blue Jay Way"" isn't a big favourite of mine but there's some wonderful, psychedelic projection art used by and for the camera to play over the song. Paul has said in retrospect that one example he uses in defending ""Magical Mystery Tour"" is the section with ""I Am The Walrus"", citing it to be the only chance to see John Lennon in fully psychedelic regalia performing the song with backup visuals of policemen and `eggheads'. It truly is a striking glimpse into John Lennon's beautifully baffling imagination from the summer of love period.

It's strange how the Beatles' first failing should follow directly from what is widely believed to be their greatest achievement, the ""Sgt. Pepper"" album. Paul has said that ""Magical Mystery Tour"" was made more as an ""art"" film than a ""proper"", conventional film. I don't think people in 1967 were ready for something like that, particularly from the Beatles, but I enjoy watching it from time to time. I think it has to be said that it would have been better had a plot been thought through for it and a script written but, as I've mentioned, there are plenty of delightful little moments to make it entertaining enough.",1377734400,6,6839,4.583333333333333

The Hello Goodbye promo film is actually the Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper outfits playing the song on a stage in a theater in London somewhere.  Near the end some Go-go girls come in and dance with them.  Why that was not included is beyond me.  They should have also included the Our World TV broadcast of the Beatles recording All you Need is Love.  It would have been great to add in real promo films for Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields as well. The two I mentioned should certainly have been included. The Deluxe falls short.

313551,5,6301095294,"I have not been a huge fan of Limited Edition/Collectible type musical product, generally being more particularly focused on the music alone.  This Box Set, however, may have awakened in me an appreciation for well-presented nostalgia.  I was so excited when it arrived, tearing off the shrink wrap and marveling at the contents within.  Everything about this package is beautifully done.  The booklet, the vinyl, the DVD/Blu-Ray discs are all housed and presented impeccably.  The inclusion of the ""Tour Ticket"" actually adds to the sense that you're actually about to experience something that takes you somewhere else.  And it does.

As many other reviewers have stated, it doesn't matter that the film sequences themselves are silly and unfocused, it's The Beatles, man!  To see the Fab Four just as they were at, arguably, their absolute creative peak is a charge, no matter how ridiculous the setting.  And when you spend ten minutes watching a meandering story-line that's book-ended by such remarkable songs as, say, ""Your Mother Should Know"" and ""I Am the Walrus,"" what is there worth complaining about?

Which brings me back to the music.  The 5.1 is stunning.  The craftmanship of the writing and production of these classic tunes has never been more apparent, or more timeless.  I sat alone in my living room as giddy as if the boys were actually there performing live for me.  The only drawback for me is that, having been originally exposed to this music on the 11-track American album version, I really felt a little short-changed by the omission of the Side 2 tracks.  Especially since ""Hello Goodbye"" is teased over the closing credits and as a stand-alone promo video, why was this not also presented in glorious surround sound?  Plus, knowing that promotional ""music videos"" were shot for ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane,"" I wondered why this would not have been an appropriate place to have presented those clips in 5.1 as bonus material.  At which point, it would have only made sense to have taken one last extra step and at least presented ""Baby, You're a Rich Man"" and ""All You Need is Love"" in surround as well.  My hope is that the reason is that there is more Beatles 5.1 on the horizon, and that there will be a more appropriate package to present such material in the near future.

The extras are fun as well with interviews from Paul and Ringo and previous interviews from George and John. But one thing that bothered me... I enjoyed the mini-bios of the supporting cast but where was the entry for Mandy Weet/Miranda Forbes who played Wendy Winters? She easily had as many lines and scenes as the others and for my money was the best looking gal in the film. Though she's passed on it would have been nice to see her included, perhaps with a bit from her later TV career. Oh well. If you are a Beatles fan or at all interested in this rather odd little film, buy nothing other than the blu-ray. One star deducted for general TV quality of print.",1365552000,,923,4.341040462427745

313781,5,6301095294,"It seems to be the fashionable thing to trash this movie, something that it doesn't deserve.  Yes, the Beatles were amateurs and probably in over their heads in trying to make a movie on their own, but the result was much better than it was given credit for.  If Monty Python had put this movie out, everyone would be ranting and raving about how great it was.

This film was a precursor to the Monty Python style of comedy, as well as music videos in general.  If anything, the Beatles were ahead of their time in making this movie.

I watched this DVD soon after purchasing it.  This was the first time I had seen the movie since it was originally released.  The quality of this DVD, both sound and video, is great!  After watching the movie, I watched the track with the commentary by Paul McCartney.  I don't know what group I will be placed in for saying this, but I really enjoyed this movie.  It was fun, it was funny, and watching the Beatles perform their music was such a treat.

313850,4,6301095294,"So how do you follow up an album like ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" (no pressure, right?).  There are a goodly number of otherwise diehard Beatle fans who would prefer to pretend that ""Magical Mystery Tour"" (the 1967 film, not the album) never happened. But it did. Right after Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play. And try as we might, we can't change history. Now, for all you youngsters in the audience this evening, MMT was originally presented as a holiday special on BBC-TV in December of 1967. According to a majority of critics (and puzzled Beatles fans), the Fabs were ringing out the old year on a somewhat sour note with this self-produced project. By the conventions of television fare at the time, the 53-minute film was judged as a self-indulgent and pointlessly obtuse affair; a real psychedelic train wreck. Added up over the years, it's probably weathered more continuous drubbing than ""Ishtar"" and ""Heaven's Gate"" combined.

However, despite the fact that this tragical history lore has become the meme, this newly restored Blu-ray release begs a critical reappraisal (after all, it's been 45 years). Granted, it remains unencumbered by anything resembling a ""plot"", but in certain respects, it has actually held up remarkably well. Borrowing a page (one assumes) from the Merry Pranksters, the Beatles came up with a simple premise. They would gather up a group of friends (actors and non actors alike), load them all on a bus, and take them on a ""mystery tour"" across the English countryside. Everybody was encouraged to improvise around the, erm, ""script"" that did exist (sort of). They would just film whatever happened, then sort it all out in the editing suite. The resulting footage provided transitional padding between the (slightly) more choreographed music numbers.

It's the musical sequences that benefit the most from the audio/video cleanup; those washed out VHS prints with horrendous sound quality that have been floating around for years certainly did no favors for the film's already tarnished reputation. The luxury of hindsight reveals that several (particularly ""Blue Jay Way"", ""Fool on the Hill"" and ""I Am the Walrus"") vibe like harbingers of MTV, which was still well over a decade away. Some of the interstitial vignettes uncannily anticipate Monty Python's idiosyncratic comic sensibilities; not a stretch when you consider that George Harrison's future production company HandMade Films was formed to help finance ""Life of Brian"". As for the film's episodic approach and surrealist touches, it falls right in line with some of the work being done at the time by art house darlings like Fellini and Godard. That being said, MMT is far from what I'd call a work of art, but when taken for what it is (a long-form music video and colorful time capsule of 60s pop culture)-it's lots of fun. Roll up!",1360713600,,2849,5.031779661016949
313851,5,6301095294,"The hype (most of it) that has surrounded this movie basically said: ""It's a silly nonsense movie, not worth your time, etc."" Well, the silliness and the nonsense are precisely the point. There is a ""Zeitgeist"" here from 1967 which is kinda ""the hippie vs. the Straight World"" or ""Authority vs. Fantasy/Dreams""...or you may have your own description. If you followed the Beatles ""down the rabbit hole""/as they evolved so-to-speak you'll know what I mean.  For me, since I've gotten it, it is one of my most watched DVDs. For exactly the reason that it IS more a ""vibe"" than about anything ""concrete"".

And the music never sounded better.  The extras, such as the remix of the video for Fool on The Hill are wonderful.
I also bought this box set for the double-vinyl EP, which is also stellar. If you are familiar with the show and like it, then buy it.

313897,4,6301095294,"The year was 1967, and the Fab Four (also known as The Beatles) were at the pinnacle of their career.  They had just solidified their position atop the music world with the ground-breaking ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" For their next project, they decided to make their third film, ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" in conjunction with the album of the same name. Their feelings of musical immortality led to the creation of a movie that would have no script; they would gather the cast, and along with a film crew would take a bus tour of England's countryside, filming whatever scenes and moments the four young men decided were worthy of taping. The self-directed movie was premiered on the BBC1 on Boxing Day (December 26th) in black and white, and the commercial uproar prevented a U.S.  release, and very limited distribution throughout the world.

Yet now we can enjoy this cinematic fantasy in glorious color, as it has been restored and remixed for a new release. The improvised story provided opportunities for the Beatles to stretch their skills, as Paul McCartney handled much of the direction, and Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr) is not only credited with being the Director of Photography, but he is the dominantly featured actor of the quartet.

The songlist included the classic title track, along with ""Fool On The Hill,"" ""Your Mother Should Know,"" and the iconic ""I Am The Walrus,"" with the infamous film footage of the band performing on an abandoned airstrip in Kent singing in fur coats and animal masks.

The many Bonus Features include brand new interviews with McCartney and Starr, along with old quotes from both George Harrison and John Lennon.

I think this is unduly harsh for a couple of reasons. First off, the music is really good -- ""I Am the Walrus,"" ""Fool on the Hill,"" and ""Your Mother Should Know"" are terrific songs, ""Blue Jay Way"" is underrated, and the title song is good too. Second, don't think of it as a rather incoherent story; think of it as a variety show with linking material. Some of it is kind of silly, some a bit surreal, and some downright weird, but there isn't a lot that isn't kind of entertaining on some level. And finally, the digital makeover has helped to make it look more like the Beatles intended it to look before it went out (in black and white!) on the BBC in 1967. It may not be the climax of that year (which, after all, saw the release of the ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" LP and the ""Penny Lane""/""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""All You Need Is Love"" singles), but it's good, (mostly) clean fun and, again, it has some music which has aged WAY better than a lot of that era!",1356566400,,1144,4.276497695852535

He jotted down his ideas on his return flight home on April 11 and presented them to the rest of the band a few days later. Paul enjoyed making movies on his own and essentially, MMT was one of his films on steroids. The first MMT recording session took place April 25 with the title track.

  It is interesting to note just a few of the events going on during this period: Finishing touches to Sgt. Pepper were still being recorded up through April 21, Yellow Submarine recording sessions began May 11, the Sgt. Pepper press release party was held May 19 where McCartney met Linda Eastman, ""All You Need Is Love"" was performed live on the BBC for the Our World Live broadcast June 25, in late July the Beatles went to Greece looking to buy an island where they could live and record together, Ringo's son Jason was born Aug. 19, the Beatles manager Brian Epstein visited the Beatles while they worked on recording ""Your Mother Should Know"" at Chappell Recording Studios, the last before he died on Aug. 27. The Beatles met at Paul's home Sept. 1 to discuss their future plans where it was decided to continue with the MMT project and put everything else on hold. Filming for MMT began September 12, Apple was formed Nov. 17. MMT was premiered in monochrome on BBC Television Dec. 26th, 1967.

  MMT was released on VHS in Hi-Fi Digital Stereo in 1988 (all songs supervised and re-mixed by George Martin, visual and dialog materials restored and re-mastered by Ron Furmanek), on DVD in Dolby Digital in 1997 (just a transfer of the 1988 production where the film negative was transferred to video at VTR Studios, London on 6/23/88 and the sound relayed from the original mag track and digital audio masters at Abbey Road Studios on 6/24-25/88), and now in surround sound in 2012.

Video: The company of Eque, Inc. under the supervision of Paul Ruttan Jr. (Yellow Submarine) was responsible for the picture restoration. Cleaned up are all the film dirt, damage and defects found in the original, as well as the colors enhanced from anemic to vivid. To compare what was to what is now, check out some of the extras, which do not have all the clean-up administered. That's the way the 1997 DVD looks throughout. Understand, this was not a high budget 35mm film and that it was intended for television broadcast in 1967, so the original material was never intended to be seen on the big screen in high resolution. Still, it looks good considering and the clean-up job is most appreciated.

Audio: Many people were involved in the audio reproduction of the 2012 re-release of MMT: Sound Producer was Giles Martin (Sir George's son). The soundtrack and songs were re-mixed at Abbey Road Studios by Sam Okell. Project coordinator was Allan Rouse. Assistant Engineer was Matt Mysko. Audio restoration was by Simon Gibson. The original recordings were made by Geoff Emerick and Ken Scott.

The audio sounds good with much improved dynamic range and very little ""flash"" given to the surround sound channels, which I'm happy about. The DTS-HD Master sounds superior to the Dolby Digital 5.1 as typical.  However, similar to the 2012 Yellow Submarine Blu-ray, though the dynamic range is actually improved by 5.6 dB over the Dolby Digital DVD, the over-all level is set more than 10 dB above reference level, so be cautious!

Bonus Features: There are eight, including Paul giving commentary of the whole film, but my two favorites are ""Meet The Supporting Cast"", which has many fun and interesting tid-bits, and the big surprise to me, Traffic's ""Here We Go Around The Mulberry Bush"". I never knew about this video or that it was made to be a part of the film. Fun to see the original Traffic line-up making a silly music video back in the psychedelic days.

There is also a 10"" square deluxe box set, which includes a 60 page soft cover book, two vinyl EPs of the original UK album, and both the Blu-ray and DVD.",1355011200,8,4225,4.7023004059539915

314104,2,6301095294,"I am a major Beatles fan, and my wife will attest that I am just short of obsessed with them.  I'm 62, and have clear memories of the first appearance of Capitol Beatles promotional material in record store windows, and was glued to my tv set on the Sunday night in February when they burst into ""All My Loving"" on Ed Sullivan.  I LOVE the Beatles.  But because of what I heard about Magical Mystery Tour when it first came out and the bits a saw in various Beatles documentaries, I resisted seeing it.  However, when this set came out, I took a chance.  I think ""I Am the Walrus"" is one of the top twenty Beatles songs, and while I was never a major fan of Blue Jay Way and think ""Fool on the Hill"" is overrated, I like the music from the soundtrack well enough,  so I figured this set with the 64 page book, and the 5.1 blue ray mastering would be worth watching.

I was wrong.  Everything that the critics said was wrong with MMT is accurate.  It is simply a self-indulgent, meandering, tedious waste of time and music.  Paul McCartney's commentary will only serve to sadden Beatles fans because Sir Paul while making it clear that the Beatles simply made use of their fame to make a film without a script or point, is unwilling to admit it is less than a wonderful piece of ""art.""  The only really stand-out scene is the wonderful performance by Victor Spinetti, who appeared in both Hard Day's Night and Help.

The book and packaging is very good, and for those who don't own the original two 45 Britsh release of the soundtrack, that is a wonderful souvenir.  And, finally, any release of Beatles music in 5.1 surround sound is great.

But the main course, the film itself, is close to terrible and serves to establish that the loss of Brian Epstein, whatever his shortcomings in financial acumen, seems to have left the Beatles without any sense of direction.  The synergy and genius of John, Paul, and George with some input from Ringo, was such that the boys continued to produce great music after Brian's death, and, almost miraculously, amid the near certainty that they were in the process of crashing and burning, they turned out one of the ten best albums of all time, Abbey Road, as a finale.  But MMT is the signpost that pointed to a likely disintegration of the group.  I'm certainly glad i didn't see it in 1967.",1354320000,5,2331,4.459905660377358

Unfortunately, the movie is of historical interest and is actually annoying after the first or second viewing.  The reason we want to watch this is the.... MUSIC.  It is great to watch the restored I am the Walrus or Your Mother Should Know. However, the original Magical Mystery Tour album/CD contains a second side of songs including Strawberry Fields Forever, Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane, Baby You're a Rich Man and All you need is love.  None of the videos for these songs are on this disc except a boring alternate video for Hello Goodbye.  For $25 bucks couldn't we get these extra videos with good sound and video quality?

I wasn't expecting much due to reviews of previous incarnations of this movie so therefore I wasn't really disappointed in the movie itself. I mainly got this to rip the surround music tracks in order to make a Beatles surround compilation from this and other sources such as Yellow Submarine, Help, Anthology and the Love dvd audio. A Hard Days Night unfortunately had little in the surround channels. My complaints with MMT was that although they included a video clip for Hello Goodbye in the Extras it was only in stereo. I was also disappointed that they did not include the Strawberry Fields video clip at all in the extras.",1354233600,,698,4.682926829268292
314108,5,6301095294,"Magical Mystery Tour was The Beatles first real production, and project since the death of their manager Brian Epstein serveral months before it's release. It is common knowledge that although all 4 Beatles had a hand in production, Paul Mccartney was the major producer and director. This was made during a very sad period with the group losing their manager and their escallating drug usage. The group at the time of his death were lost, confused, and not sure what direction to take. Of course their music didn't suffer, but other major problems were starting to arise. As far as this movie (or experimental film, depending on who you ask) was concerned, no one knew much about it before it's release. It is part avant garde meets Monty Python. It was shown right before Christmas 1967, in black and white, and was seriously panned right away by all the critics. Yes The Beatles had their first flop, no question. As of today the film now has a strong cult following and is enjoyed by many who now understand it. You are either going to love this film or hate it. The Beatles themselves look tired and drugged out to say the least. No happy and crazyness like ""A Hard Day's Night"" or ""HELP"" here. But the film has some good moments. I believe the best is the ""I Am The Walrus"" musical excerpt. If you are a Beatles completist you must have this in your collection. As for the blu-ray itself, it looks like a brand new recently discovered print was used and it trumps over the previous home video and dvd version. Most scratches and debris have been removed, and picture is sharper, colors brighter and more detail. Although this is far from hd demo quality. The audio has been remixed to DTS HD 5.1, and sounds spectacular. You also get a new Paul Mccartney commentary, plus some other extras, plus a couple of hidden easter eggs, if you can find them. So weird as it all is, if you are a Beatles fan, you definitely want to upgrade to the Blu-ray version of Magical Mystery Tour. Highly recommended.",1353974400,,2003,4.566666666666666

314182,3,6301095294,"We waited years in the U.S.A. for ""Magical Mystery Tour"" to be released and eventually it did see the light of day on cable TV and video release decades too late.  The main saving grace is the music itself, some of the Beatles finest to be sure.  However the film itself was a disappointment to me.  In the ""spirit"" of the times it had a very loosely defined point which is to say there isn't much of a plot.  But most die hard Beatles fans will want this in their collection of course and now we have it on Blu-ray.  I'm writing this just to alert potential buyers that it may be wise to shop around for a better price.  At this date, Thanksgiving eve 2012, I've seen it at Target for their everyday price of $19.99 for the Blu-ray edition.  They did not carry the deluxe version or at least I didn't see it.  I would guess that other retailers have about that price, as Target tends to price according to local market competition (Wal-Mart, Best Buy, etc.).  For such a less than best film it's probably worth finding a lower price but I wouldn't wait too long as this may be one of those items that becomes rare down the road.

314185,5,6301095294,"This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  THe Beatles have done what no other band of their era could do, at least as good as they have - go off on some weird experimental thing, like the Monkees' ""Head"", for example.  Head was cute, but nothing compared to MMT.  It's true, I do wish I was on that bus, and I wish I was one of the lucky viewers on December 26, 1967, at 8:30 pm British time.  After the Petula Clark show, the Beatles were going to be in a new special, and after getting everything I wanted for Christmas and with some time off from work for the holidays, what better way to digest all those Christmas leftovers than to watch the new Beatles tv special.  For years, I'd take out my old VHS copy and watch it on December 26 to recreate the fun that at least some of the viewers had - the viewers who didn't make it into the papers the next day.

This can be seen as a sort of drug-induced sequel, or even a parody, of A Hard Day's Night, wherein you have a cantankerous relative in the care of one of the band members - Jessie Robins steals her scenes just as Wilfred Brambell had in ""HDN"" - also, the songs just happen to pop up with no real build up from the previous scene, no dialogue led you into them, but they're such great songs no one even cares.

People try to see this as a long-form video, but it's more than that.  It truly is the story of a bunch of charabanc bus passengers seeing and experiencing some pretty weird stuff as they head for the Blackpool Lights - all guided by 4 magicians.

So, where's the bus?  It's 10 miles north on Dewsbury Road - and you'll have a lovely time.",1352937600,,1634,4.1424050632911396

314280,4,6301095294,"The Beatles have left a legacy within great portions from monumental to experimental.  And it is the latter, which shows in their 1967 BBC Christmas special ""Magical Mystery Tour and one of the last projects that the band had to fulfill after Manager Brian Epstein's death.  The wackiness of a ""Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help,"" unfortunately is lacking in this film, and there appears to be an attempt to recreate the animation but with much eccentricity.  But fans and the Beatle curious may want to keep in mind that the film and the soundtrack came out after the legendary ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band"" and yet another transition that was happening not only in the band member's personal and musical lives, but the beginnings of a counter culture and revolution of the 1960s youth.

The film shows the members of the Beatles and their cast of unrestrained actors in multicolored scenes that appear not to make sense.  But with the sound of the band's post Pepper production, one can say that the band has progressed with the allotment of songs that are included in the film and the album and British EP that was released there is the that continuity of creativity and experimentation by each member that differentiates the Beatles image and sound apart from the rest of bands and artists that attempted to emulate the band's sound and image.  For fans that have followed the numerous re-releases of the film, this most recent release and re-mastering of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" lacks a certain quality that previously releases possessed, such as the first re-master that came out over almost 20 years ago - the picture quality had much more clarity. But by far, the soundtrack itself has only improved for this release as well as the additional previously unreleased clips that accompany this release, ""Your Mother Should Know,"" the almost student-film like quality for ""Hello Goodbye"" and a new cut of ""Fool on the Hill.""  Other surprises include Traffic's ""Here We Go Around the Mulberry Bush"" where viewers can see a very young Stevie Winwood.

At first I thought the $26.00 price tag was a little steep for a film with a running time of less than one hour but the video and audio quality are absolutely amazing.  This film benefits from some great bonus HD features, many of the video numbers being extended and tiny bits of additional footage being added.  Unless you count the remix on the ""LOVE"" album, this marks the very first time ""I Am The Walrus"" is seen and heard in full stereo and in glorious HD which makes the entire package worth the money.  Most Beatles fans are aware that the second half of the album version of that song is in fake stereo.  Some shots, such as the General who talks gibberish, sections of the ""Spaghetti"" scene, ""Bluejay Way"" and certain other random shots are quite grainy, which is understandable given the 45 year age of the film, but overall it was remastered incredibly well.  The colors are vivid and the picture looks like it was filmed recently.  The songs sound bright and crisp, as does the dialogue.  One scene that sticks out in particular is ""Fool On The Hill.""  In closeups, when Paul is twitching his face, you can see the moistness of his eyeballs, their bright color, their reflection off the camera and every blood vessel.

314285,4,6301095294,"Most of the people getting the DVD have seen it before, and wanted to get this and ""Yellow Submarine"" on Blu-Ray. There's nothing much to say about the actual film itself- they tried to do an Electric Kool Aid Acid Test meets the Blackpool Lights. It does make one wish Terry Gilliam or Richard Lester to make it more cohesive, but as a long form video, the meat and bones of the film are the songs put to film.

I can't imagine what the audience who saw this on Boxing Day made from this movie. They weren't the four lovable moptops people loved in ""Help"" and ""A Hard Days Night"", that's for sure. The vibe was ""we're the Beatles, we can do anything we want, and people will love it"". Not when this came out! The bloom was off the rose, and it would be less than a year when John and Yoko would put ""Two Virgins"" out.

I think for the fan club secretaries who are in the ""making of"" and played extras, it was a great time for them because when else would they have had access to the band?

I do find it interesting that none of them had their wives and girlfriends in it, even though they filmed it close to home. Maybe not Cynthia or Maureen, but I figured at least Patti Boyd & Jane Asher would've made some sort of appearance in it because people were familiar with them.

I think the scene with John shoveling food has all sorts of things going in it, kind of disturbing, but knowing his dad did menial work (Paul mentions John looking like his father in the commentary), John's weight issues, and a little bit of the tone of ""In His Own Write"", is not so surreal.

The restoration looks as good as we're going to get. I'm got a DVD copy from the library just to compare picture quality, but I didn't see much of a difference, but listening to it was worth getting it. I am enjoying hearing the Beatles on Blu Ray though!!

The commentary by Paul - some of it's familiar stuff, but still interesting to hear him talk about.

The bonus about the actors was interesting and the outtakes were really cool to see.

As far as Ringo goes, it's not like he ever made great movies, but he did get to work with great actors and the most natural in front of a camera.

Paul as a filmmaker - you would've thought this would've let him stick to just making music and videos, but no, he did ""Give My Regard To Broad Street"". His animation DVD is great and his music video compilations are awesome, but as a filmmaker? I think when George became a producer for Monty Python and other films, he should have done something with Ringo and Paul.

Why the promos weren't included, makes no sense unless there's plans for a video collection, but to not include ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""Penny Lane"", and the two other versions of ""Hello Goodbye"", but was pretty cool seeing the promo on the DVD. One of the best things to see is the footage of Traffic.

The question will always be whether or not they should've made a film around ""Sgt Pepper"".

Summary: the DVD & Blu Ray visual quality doesn't make much of a difference but look good, the bonuses are good, and commentary by McCartney make it worth getting.

Unrelated - DO watch the great ""Magic Trips"" documentary about the real Merry Pranksters.

MMT is more the ""merry because they're high, but not all that Fab...but at least the music's great"".",1352332800,3,3291,4.364975450081833

I saw it on screen in my college days at one of those midnight showings at a local Jerry Lewis Cinema along with ""Reefer Madness"" and some other similarly-themed film epics that attracted the dazed fans. It is silly, fun, pointless, Python-like, and a real treat for Beatles fans. I never thought of it as a home movie as critics describe. It's more of a stream-of-consciousness effort created by some very rich and very high musicians who owned the world.
My sole gripe about the creation itself is that John Lennon appears to be sleep walking through most of the movie. Obviously bored, he seems to be there only out of obligation. His best scenes come when he injects a bit of the Lennon humor: shoveling spaghetti; falling over in the ""Your Mother Should Know"" ending; and talking to Nichola. Also, I think that's him selling Ringo the tour tickets at the beginning. At his best (""I am the Walrus"")he is brilliant as Paul is in ""Fool on the Hill.""In his later days, he said the film was Paul's project and he didn't have much to do with it because he was sick of being a Beatle. I think he was either too stoned, too lazy or both. Too bad. It was his chance to put his zany stamp on on something that has stood the test of time just like any of the Beatles' works.
George is George, relegated to one song. He too needed to be more in the forefront. Watch some of his later solo videos to see how talented a filmster he could be.
To me, Ringo and Paul make the show a delight. It's their interest and involvement that keep the magic in the tour.
As far as the packaging goes, where's the ""Hello Goodbye"" video? How about some more of the actual criticism at the time? In addition, this is obviously a blueprint for the future works of Monty Python. Why not put some of their comments in?
Even the printed material could have used more industry and historical perspective.
Still, I've watched it four times since I bought it four days ago. I particularly love Paul's commentary although he could have used a cup of expresso before he taped it.
(Next, chronologically, we should get ""Let It Be."" But I guess that there's some difficulty with the music licensing as the band went through quite a few cover versions.)",1351987200,,2241,4.454987834549878
314349,4,6301095294,"I host a Beatles show here in Seattle every Sunday morning so of course I had to check out the TV show the boys made for The BBC to air in black and white on Boxing Day. While the actual show was pretty disjointed(pun intended) the music was fantastic. Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George, did a bang up job remixing in 5.1 surround. I have a good laugh every time I watch the spaghetti scene and a sentimental feeling for The Fool On The Hill segment. The Bonus footage is great. While the story line or lack there of is weak, the music more than saves the day. John Paul George and Ringo looked like they were having fun and you will too.",1351814400,3,649,4.2
314350,4,6301095294,"Sir Paul has stood by this film for many years. He defended it in the ""Anthology"" interviews in '95 and he took the time to do a commentary track for the Blu-ray release. Viewing the film in restored clarity made me realize that Magical Mystery Tour is a sort of diamond in the rough... buried two feet underground.... in solid waste. However, there are some interesting things going on here. It's ahead of its time in many ways. For example, ways of editing scenes that have actually become far more commonplace now than in the era it was produced. On the other hand, the whole film is pretty silly and everyone involved spent more time smoking herbal jazz cigarettes than trying to create a riveting viewing experience.

If you aren't a Beatles fan, you may want to steer clear. For Beatles fans, however, it's worth watching if for no other reason than the ""I am the Walrus"" sequence. This is a great little music video from a time when there was no such thing.

Check out the extras as well for some interesting bits. T & A alert... you'll see a lot more of the stripper than you did in the final film.",1351728000,4,1106,4.443349753694581
314351,4,6301095294,"I first saw MMT as a Biafra benefit showing in January of '69 in Santa Rosa, CA.  It think it was only one of two American screenings at the time. The other was at a now defunct and torn down Haight Street theater in San Francisco. I was into it at the time because it WAS The Beatles and it was rare.  Later on I saw MMT on video and it did seem amateurish and dated.  No wonder it was considered The Beatles first ""flop"" in '67.

I like that the reissue is with dual vinyl EP's, just like the imports we used to see in the record stores alongside ""With The Beatles"" & ""Beatles For Sale"". The Capitol LP we had in The States also included the two singles that bookended Sgt. Pepper and were not included in the movie. That's the way they repackaged The Fabs for the American audience back then.

This reissue is for die hard psychedelic Beatle fans and should not be the initial introduction of The Beatles to younger, innocent, and curious viewers. Start with ""Please Please Me"" and work your way forward to MMT.

2012 Apple DVD

This Apple version of the television special is a true remaster and the only version worth owning.  Still, it never was the greatest bit of entertainment ever made, in fact, for an hour-long show; some of it is downright boring.  However, it is worth owning for its visual versions of ""I am the walrus"", ""Fool on the hill"", ""Blue Jay Way"", and ""Your mother should know"".

This DVD has a commentary track by Paul with is nice, but not as informative as one would expect.

There are various re-edits of the songs as bonus bits, but the visuals are mainly pieces of footage that are not an improvement over the original film versions.

The best bonus feature is the inclusion of Traffic's ""The Mulberry Bush"" (which was left out of the original film).  Seeing this very early version of Traffic is a real treat.

The film (even at its best) is only a 3 1/2 Star film, but its remaster plus the bonus features make this a Four Star DVD.",1351123200,3,978,4.4858757062146895
314355,5,6301095294,"Long the victim of a bad reputation, ""Magical Mystery Tour"" redeems itself with this release.  Critics have long criticized the film for not being a blockbuster, but it was never meant to be. The new release offers a cleaned-up, brilliant print and soundtrack memorializing the Beatles' whimsical foray into the English countryside first broadcast the day after Christmas, 1967.  That first showing of the Beatles' ""home movie"" on little B&W television sets failed to convey the color and energy of the project; enjoying it on a normal TV screen with proper sound -- it's a whole new ball game.

Included in this release are a commentary by Paul McCartney, deleted scenes, ""remixes"" of some songs, information about the supporting cast, and an interesting ""making of"" documentary.  (Did you know those aerial scenes from ""Flying"" were leftover footage from ""Dr. Strangelove""?) The film is, in turns, funny, touching and bizarre, but always entertaining.  And let's face it, the music is fabulous.  I highly recommend this, the greatest home movie of all!",1351123200,4,1054,5.170588235294118
314356,5,6301095294,"MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was filmed in the fall of 1967, and was The Beatles' first major project after the death of manager Brian Epstein.  While the film's soundtrack (a double-EP in Britain, an 11-song album in America, which was also imported into the UK, where it was eventually released on cassette in 1973 and on LP in 1976) was an enormous success, the film was not.  It was first shown on the BBC on Boxing Day (26 December) 1967 in monochrome (most British viewers had black-and-white TV sets) and was not received well by the public, or by critics (""blatant rubbish"" and ""tasteless nonsense"" were two of the milder descriptions).  A second colo(u)r broadcast appeared on BBC2 on 05 January 1968, but only the few Britons who had ""colour"" TVs saw it, and the damage was done.

In America, both ABC and NBC withdrew their bids for a network broadcast of MMT; the film made its U.S. debut at New York's Fillmore East a few months later as part of a fundraising concert.  Over the years, Apple rented the film to colleges and indie movie theaters.  The film did not appear on American TV until it was syndicated in 1985, which was where I saw it for the first time.  A few poor-quality VHS tapes appeared in the early-to-mid-1980s, but the first proper video release was in 1988, when Apple and MPI Home Video released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/an-official-VHS-tape/dp/6301095294/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">an official VHS tape</a>, with a restored soundtrack by George Martin.

MMT has been out of print for years, although it has been bootlegged, but has just been re-released by Apple in DVD and Blu-ray format, as well as the Deluxe Collector's Edition, which I purchased.

To be honest, the film is no CITIZEN KANE or even A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  But it is a good piece of entertainment, and contains seven terrific Beatles songs:  the title track, ""The Fool On The Hill,"" the instrumental ""Flying,"" George Harrison's ""Blue Jay Way,"" the classic ""I Am The Walrus,"" which appears in full stereo all the way through, and Paul's ""Your Mother Should Know,"" which is the film's closing production number.  ""Hello Goodbye"" plays over the closing credits.  The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band's rendition of ""Death Cab For Cutie"" (featuring future Monty Python member and Rutle Neil Innes) is also an hilarious classic.  One of the outtake scenes, Nat Jackley's romp around the pool with pretty girls, directed by John Lennon, features an unreleased Lennon-McCartney instrumental called ""Shirley's Wild Accordion,"" played by accordionist Shirley Jackson.  The stereo and 5.1 surround-sound soundtrack is excellent, and the picture restoration is good too, although some of the colors have faded over time.  There are also four deleted scenes that are hidden on the main menu in the form of ""Easter eggs""; two of them can be accessed by going to the ""Play Film"" option and clicking on the up-arrow or left-arrow key on your remote; the other two can be accessed by going to the ""Audio Options"" option and using either the up-arrow or right-arrow key.  Sir Paul McCartney's Director's Commentary can either be listened to, viewed with subtitles if you don't want to override the film soundtrack, or both.  There are two sets of subtitles; one for the main film, the other for Paul's commentary (11 languages in all).  The subtitles also apply to the special features.

See Amazon's product description for more on the special features on the DVD and Blu-ray.  The Deluxe Edition is worth having for the additional 60-page book, including essays by Sir Paul McCartney and Barry Miles, and an ""itinerary"" of the scenes shot in the film.  There is also a reproduction of the original mono vinyl double-EP that was issued in the UK in 1967.  This brings my MMT collection full circle; I purchased the stereo EP years ago as an import; I have three versions of the vinyl album - the original 1967 Capitol LP (with three fake stereo Duophonic songs), the all-stereo German issue from 1971 (with the pink cover) that was the template for the later CD release, and the 1976 UK Parlophone pressing that is identical to Capitol's.  I also have the original CD from 1987, the stereo/mono CD version of the EP, issued in 1992 as part of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Compact-Disc-EP-Collection/dp/B000008DB7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Compact Disc EP Collection</a>, and the remastered mono and stereo CDs from 2009.

While it's not the best film, it's worth having, especially if you're a Beatle fan.  Stripped of the dialogue, it would make an excellent long-form music video (unfortunately, there is no ""songs-only"" option).  4 stars for content; 5 stars for packaging and quality.

314428,4,6301095294,"I admit, the first time I watched ""Magical Mystery Tour"" I could not even sit through the entire thing. The second time I was a little more impressed but still thought it was a terrible film. The third time, however, while listening to Paul McCartney's commentary was much more enjoyable. It made me understand the film much better. It is not just an ""acid trip"" movie like people assume. And watching it in high-definition makes the experience much greater. I am pretty impressed with restoration. Though it is not as perfect as the restored version of ""Yellow Submarine"" it appears as though Apple still knows what they're doing. And most importantly, the movie is not cropped to widescreen. It is in its original aspect ratio, which was not done in the Blu-ray version of ""A Hard Day's Night"" (I refuse to buy it for that reason).

Some of the film's best moments are of course the music videos. If you watch it for no other reason just watch it for this. Especially ""The Fool on the Hill"", ""I am the Walrus"" and ""Your Mother Should Know"". Another great scene is of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band singing ""Death Cab for Cutie"". The singer's voice and movements are hilarious. Besides the music videos it is the best part of the movie.

The special features are wonderful as well. Though I was disappointed because I thought The Ed Sullivan Show version of ""Hello Goodbye"" was going to be included. But Paul McCartney's commentary and the making of featurette make up for it. Paul even mentions the ""Paul is Dead"" rumor at the end of the film. More importantly, he goes on to say that they loved to give clues to fans to mess around with them. And we finally know who the walrus is; Paul and John both trade costumes throughout the music video. Anyone who still believes the ""Paul is Dead"" conspiracy is a complete idiot. I once was skeptical about it, but once you learn as much as I have about The Beatles you realize it is impossible for it to be true.

""Magical Mystery Tour"" is far from your conventional film. I find great charm in this and am glad I purchased the Blu-ray. I am not into artsy films to be honest, but if it's The Beatles it feels different. They were so talented at everything they took on it is hard to not love everything they have done. I really hope to see a restored version of ""Help!"" on Blu-ray in the near future.

314430,4,6301095294,"and even Paul McCartney admits on the commentary track it suffered from indulgence. At the time of its first (limited) run in theaters, I recall most of my friends agreed... that we could no longer consider our beloved Beatles perfect, and certainly not as film makers. However, the concept was a good one and had it been left to seasoned film makers, perhaps it wouldn't have seemed so hodge-podge and, having benefitted from a script, would have been more coherent. The structure of Michael Nesmith's Elephant Parts is really quite similar, but without the bus.  (3 stars on the film)

As far as the new blu-ray is concerned, a satisfying print was somehow gleaned from the substandard 16mm celluloid and the music compositions have been given a remarkable surround treatment, one of which I'm happy to say has finally been remixed in stereo from beginning to end (I Am The Walrus). It's worth the price if only just for the music videos (Fool On The Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, I Am The Walrus, and Your Mother Should Know),  which can be directly accessed on the search menu. One personal mystery was solved; I always thought the aerial footage utilized on ""Flying"" was derived from Stanley Kubrick's  Dr. Strangelove.

Its my favorite among the five films simply because it stands out as the unique one among the lot and it also ushers in my favorite period of the band. With that said having read reviews by others I am suprised to find that no one touched upon the look of the restoration.

I have purchased this film in numerous formats over the years beginning with the 1988 vhs official mpi copy that was superb by the way, the 1997 first official dvd mpi and now the restored dvd. Regarding this new dvd I have to say I am a bit disappointed with the restoration. The picture does look beautiful as others have pointed out but the one issue that I have to address is the long shots ... they are out of focus and a bit blury where as The close ups are perfection.

Am I the only one that has noticed this? At first I thought ok its a made for tv movie from 1967 and it was shot by The Beatles by the seat of their pants and maybe the long shots were always out of focus? Well I slipped on my 1997 mpi dvd copy and found that the long shots were just as clear as the close-ups! So as the title of my review states it's a mystery to me. All of the people who worked on the restoration and no one noticed this? With that said and off my chest I welcome the opinions of others on this issue to see if Im not the only fool on the hill that noticed.

I will say that regardless of the imperfection its still worth the purchase of this reissue for the extras alone. They make it all worth it and a splendid time is still guaranteed for all",1350518400,8,1561,3.964968152866242

314433,5,6301095294,"We can all agree that the movie itself is either a hot or cold response as you either take it for what it is, or you just don't find much to like about it. But I'd like to talk about the package you are buying more than the movie you'll watch (on DVD or BluRay).

The first round of DVDs released early on in the dawn of DVDs were very good. Even Magical Mystery Tour looked and sounded great. But, it was just another way to watch your favorite Beatles movies. VHS/Beta/Laserdisc/CED formats all covered most of their films. They even issued video CDs of their movies. I even bought a Quicktime movie version of A Hard Day's Night back in the day. That day wasn't so long ago but it seems it now - 1993? But with each subsequent format came subsequent releases on said format. DVD was just the latest format back in the late 1990s. Video compression schemes' quality varied company to company and has been constantly improving since the advent of DVD. But a DVD can only hold 10mbps of information within it's ""stream"" of digital content. So no matter how well you could compress the video, it could only ever be ""so good"". BluRay, which is a high definition format, changes the game yet again. It forces every movie release to be improved upon to the best possible quality possible. As a result, even the DVD release looks better than the 1999 version of this movie on DVD because the master was of the highest quality.

Sound-wise, 5.1 or stereo doesn't change much, for this movie. But it does offer you choices of audio so you can't go wrong audio-wise. I recall the ""official"" VHS release of MMT and the first remixing of the soundtrack (at least the songs) done by George Martin specifically for the release. It sounded better than ever! So no surprise this release sounds great. VHS as you may recall delivered very high end Hi-Fidelity Stereo sound. But for those who prefer a good 5.1 surround sound, you won't be disappointed. It delivers! It delivers in DTS and Dolby Digital as well on the BluRay as well as a stereo PCM track. (PCM - Pulse Code Modulation) offers the listener the highest possible audio reproduction for the home shy of having the master tapes.

As for the Printed items, again it delivers. Like I said before, this movie has been delivered on several formats several times each before. From bootlegs to official releases the content of the film has been available for quite some time. So to just release the movie isn't such a big deal to me which is why this set was so attractive to me. To have the reprint of the booklet that came with the LP back in the day as well as an expanded version of information and rare ""behind the scenes photos"" makes this set a nice addition to your Beatles collection. Even if you have the miniature version of the booklet which was contained in the 2009 stereo & mono remasters or the 1993 EP Box Set, this is a great way to see it large again like in the LP.

I already came across a perfect copy of the original vinyl EP years ago at my favorite record store. So really, that didn't do much for me, but most people do not have this so its inclusion is a real treat! For those in the states (or who didn't have access to imports from England) this was how Brits got this new music. So its inclusion is really a part of the package - film & music - that England got to judge this movie and its music from. They didn't get to also have the whole second side of an album with classics like Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields Forever and All You Need Is Love.  In the UK, Strawberry Fields & Penny Lane were released a year prior to MMT. In the states we got spoiled as we had the album with a whole collection of great non-soundtrack songs and since we didn't see the film on TV, we imagined for years what the movie had to be like from the music. So this helps put it into historical perspective as a set. (I won't be playing my vinyl though. I haven't played my original EP either).

Since all things can be improved upon, the only thing they could have done better was to do what they did for the 2007 re-release of HELP! with a deluxe book and two discs. I love that release with the fun replica objects and hand-written lyrics etc they placed within the book. (Something you can't get from a Kindle version). But this film isn't long enough to warrant 2 discs. The special features and the movie are each 53 minutes long. But the special features are new! They include new interviews and scenes which were cut from this film. So for those of you who feel they didn't really edit this movie well, check out the stuff that didn't make it! lol But again, HELP! was HELP! and this is totally different kind of movie - Free Form and rather non-linear. It tries to be linear in parts to appease the masses, but really, it wanders from idea to idea, much like a Monty Python sketch show. lol But it's nitpicking as there really isn't anything wrong with what the did do here with this release. I just like that style of books.

As for Bonus stuff and extras, the real stand out extra is the commentary by Sir Paul himself (who was more of the director than anyone else for this project). His insight, though defensive of the film, adds a new layer of how to watch this film and what to watch for when viewing it subsequent times. It helps give perspective and sets the stage, so to speak, for viewing this film in context of how it was made and why they made the choices they did.

Let's face it, you're not even considering this set if you aren't a Beatles fan. Not at the price! So anyone who isn't already a fan is going to look for the stand alone DVD at the lowest price, if they are even curious. So for a Beatles fan, this is a must! It's just the way they should have honored their work. Put it into perspective and tell the story the way the Beatles want to tell it. Critics have already had their chance.

I now hope A Hard Day's Night get the same respect and treatment as Yellow Submarine, Mystery Tour & HELP! have. If the Beatles were actually more hands on with the animated feature, Yellow Sub, I'd expect more than just a few nice reprints included in that package. But they did that release right as well.

However, make no mistake, this one is for fans ONLY! It took my several attempts before I could even make it through the whole thing without cringing. This is essentially a home movie that the Beatles made the mistake of broadcasting. - The commentary track from Paul is good and there is a nice 'making of' segment, but I think they could have done a little better with the extras since they know the movie itself is not that good. They also hid a few cookies on the main menu, which I think should have been just listed in the extras to make it easier for everyone.",1350259200,14,695,4.2727272727272725
314435,5,6301095294,"I first saw the film at a local theater shortly after John's death. It was on the same bill with ""Shea Stadium.""

 They really did a great job with the video and audio, and it has great special features, as well.

 So far, I've found four 'Easter Eggs.' They are as follows:

""Fish and Chip Shop""-4:44
""Missing Dining Room Scene""-4:10
""Magic Alex Sings Walls of Jericho""-1:31
""Jessie's Blues""-2:17",1350259200,2,397,4.779411764705882

314498,5,6301095294,"I'm mainly writing this to stress that there are multiple versions of this film available on DVD, and Amazon can't seem to differentiate among them.

If you're looking at Amazon's listing of the 2012 DVD release of this film, you're looking at a great disc. If you're looking at a DVD released prior to 2012, you're looking at a bootleg, and a poor bootleg at that.

From 1963-1970, the Beatles made five films: A Hard Day's Night (1963/64), Help! (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967), Yellow Submarine (1968 - they didn't really have much to do with it), and Let It Be (1969, released 1970, not on DVD as of this writing). If you're into the Beatles at all, you really need all five films.

If you've ever seen it before (and not many have), this is the best that Magical Mystery Tour will ever look. The Beatles were on their own, their manager and friend Brain Epstein having passed away a few months prior. They did the film on their own (mostly Paul McCartney), without a script, and it was a mess. Nevertheless, it contains videos for six songs that are classics in the Beatles' canon, and the videos for the most part serve the songs well.

The extras on the 2012 DVD are too cool to ignore and make the DVD well worth the price of admission.",1350172800,5,1248,4.4605263157894735

314501,5,6301095294,"...and this time, they got it quite right.  The smiling begins the moment you open the Amazon box and lay your eyes upon the beautiful nearly 10 x 10 box which encases this very nicely put together set.

Some may complain about having to pay for the two disc formats; if it means, however, getting this overall deluxe package, it's worth not letting this one detail get in the way.

Before getting to the ""main event"", we have a nice set of bonus features.  My personal favorite of these is the ""outtake"" video of Your Mother Should Know in which we see ""the boys"" clearly enjoying themselves amidst smiling stumbles and do-overs.  When I was getting to Hello Goodbye i expected the ""usual"" Sgt Pepper outfitted performance video.  Instead I saw something I, myself, had never seen before..a black and white sort of scripted concept piece set to the music interspersed with scenes of the group going over parts of the film on a viewing machine.

One thing to point out about the bonus sequences is that the video quality of these outtakes was not 'corrected"" all that much if at all...there's a little bit of ""grain"" and ""scratch"" but not something to get too upset about. Also, in the musical sequences, the sound, while quite good, is not as aurally enveloping as in the actual movie.

The book which accompanies this box is, in a word, a delight to read and look through.  In words, it aptly catches the spirit of the times both in terms of The Beatles' world and the world around them at that phase in their careers.  Pictorially, it's beautifully layed out adding effectively to the overall ""flavor"" and 'color"" of the Summer of 1967;  some shots are very familiar, some not as familiar...it's all good.

The double EP vinyl set-a reproduction of the original-was, for me-a vinyl lover-quite a treat and, perhaps, the main reason I salivated over this deluxe version.  We get the original mono versions of the six movie songs pressed on Parlophone repro labels.  Not only is the sound quality deep and vibrant, the actual heavy quality vinyl pressings are quiet and near flawless.  These, by the way, are far superior to the Capitol 45 RPM re-issue pressings appearing in the Target and record Store Day boxes.  As a continuing fan of the ""record"", I'm extremely happy with these.

...and, finally, the movie itself;  as  always , it continues to be a joyful watch as a time piece representing-as the book states-The Beatles within the context of The Summer of Love.  The visual quality-given the shortcomings of the original film-is gorgeous;  the sound-with most consideration given to the song sequences-is breathtaking.  This is, by far, the very best these songs have ever sounded in my opinion.

If you are an average fan of The Beatles I recommend the bluray/DVD disc on it's own.  If, however, you happen to fall into that sacred group of ""serious"" Beatle fans, this deluxe version is a must-have as far as I'm concerned-most especially if you're a fan of vinyl-not only for the records but for the beautiful reproduction of the story book as well.  Well done, Apple.",1350086400,7,3080,4.7443609022556394
314502,5,6301095294,"This newly restored Blu-ray edition of Magical Mystery Tour is still the great curio of entertaining visuals and sound that I always considered it to be. Though it was initially reviewed as unintelligible and indulgent,this film was way ahead of its time. Felliniesque,Monty Pythonesque,this film defies categorization. In a mere 53 minutes,the film is an off the cuff storyline in a bare-bones format featuring the Fab Four leading us along the British countryside with an odd assortment of characters like Ringo's Aunt Jessie(Jessie Robbins)and Mr. Bloodvessel(Ivor Cutler),that sometimes tests the viewer's patience but ultimately yields a well-balanced product of humor and psychedelia buoyed by 6 new songs with special kudos to ""I Am The Walrus"".Other than the performance of this song,the strongest visual for me is John serving Aunt Jessie a mountain of spaghetti with a shovel in a dream and Neil Innes' Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band's performance of ""Death Cab For Cutie"".There's some slight color fading but it's still a marked improvement over previous editions. The lossless sound offers crisp clarity and fidelity one would expect from the Beatles. As one of the final images of the film reaches its finality:the Fabs ascending the staircase in ""Your Mother Should Know"",the realization is there--a film,a group that defied definition but was yet,very mythic.",1350086400,,1366,5.417840375586854

While previous releases were muddy in both picture and sound, we now have a crisp clean print with great sound to match. The 5.1 DTS is especially impressive. Paul's bass on ""I am the Walrus"" sounds as if he's playing in the room with you. Anyone who has seen this movie knows that the story sections are at times meadering and unfocused, but it's still fun to see the boys goofing around. The real reason for getting this DVD is of course the music. Six great Beatle tunes and a campy cameo by The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band performing ""Death Cab for Cutie"" make this a worthy purchase. There are also many extras including a making of documentary and ""new"" cuts of three of the songs created from outtake footage, a deleted musical scene featuring a young Stevie Windwood and Traffic and a rare BBC promo film of ""Hello, Goodbye""  Bottom line: If you love The Beatles then this new release should be a part of your collection.

In their relative short history, The Beatles did it all. All that remains in popular music are the imitators.

Magical Mystery Tour is an avant-garde comedy musical. It fails at times (sometimes miserably so as in the scene with the army drill sergeant), stumbles about without coherence for intervals, but in the end comes together as the total silly spectacle that only The Beatles could pull off.

The musical numbers are of course the best part, but I also like viewing the world of the 1960's. The retro styles in the clothes, the hairstyles and the scenery are interesting to say the least. I get a sense of melancholia when I realize the world of the 60's is streaming out well behind us now.

The whole thing has been completely visually cleaned and a very fine audio mix as well. For me personally, the best mix of this is I Am The Walrus. The second half is in true stereo which has never really been available since the original true stereo master for the second part is lost, which is why we have the phony stereo mix on the album. Also, we have Paul, Ringo and others involved in the project share experiences in the Making Of documentary. Among other special features is unseen footage including sequences that were cut from the final film (one of them featuring Traffic) notes for supporting cast, and alternate music sequences for The Fool On The Hill, Your Mother Should Know, and Your Mother Should Know. Also Hello Goodbye from the Top Of The Pops.

As a reccomendation for serious collectors, I would still keep the VHS version since there are some original auido mixes for some of the songs and other bits there that are not found anywhere else. Again, the VHS version from 1988 has a good hi-fi stereo sound for its time. So if you don't have the VHS, you should probably get that too.

The film in my opinion is an odd but enjoyable one. The 1967 ""oddity"" was written and produced The Beatles, the film had no script and was made up as it went. The remastering was done by the same guys who did Yellow Submairne. The film looks perfect.

So finally, Apple has decided to re-release the Magical Mystery Tour film with fully remastered film and soundtrack. At least they are doing the soundtrack right this time. When I bought the remastered Help! DVD, the soundtrack was only either in stereo or 5.1 DTS. I don't have DTS on my A/V receiver, so I couldn't listen to it in full surround sound. Magical Mystery Tour is in Dolby 5.1 surround sound, so that's a good thing (too bad Help! wasn't). I've seen MMT a few times, and I've had mixed feelings about the film. On the one hand, it's The Beatles, and like many Beatles fans, I tend to scoop up anything Beatles. So seeing them in a film, ANY film is one I'll watch. However, the film is what it is. This was The Beatles first foray into making their own film, doing it their own way, without any real professional help or guidance. And it does show, since MMT doesn't have the type of direction their other movies had (sans Let It Be). But MMT is an enjoyable film nonetheless, and I will be looking for it at Wal-Mart to see what their pricing will be on it. I'll only get the single DVD release. While the box set looks nice, what I'm more interested in is the DVD, and seeing how good the remastering process was for this DVD. So now the question: Will Let It Be come next?? While Beatles fans have clamored for Let It Be to be released and remastered, for the Beatles, this was the one movie they would have probably preferred not to release, since it is essentially as Paul McCartney put it ""watching the Beatles break up on camera"". It's got great music, and the rooftop concert can't be beat, but it is a somber chapter in Beatle history. But it does bring to an end what Beatles publicist Derek Taylor once called the Beatles ""the twentieth century's greatest romance"".

UPDATE (10/9): Today is MMT day, and I went over to Wal-Mart to get the Magical Mystery Tour DVD. They only had the single DVD though. I didn't see the Blu-Ray version or the box set. Anyways, I got it home and watched it. Apple did a very good job with remastering the movie. For the DVD, everything look pretty crisp and clear. I can only assume how good the Blu-Ray version would look. The audio mastering was very good too. Even the spoken dialogue was cleaned up and sounds good. When I used to watch MMT, I could never understand what the couriers on the bus were saying through the hand held mics during the film. With the audio remastering, you can hear it really good. So it's not just the songs that benefit from the sound makeover, but the movie dialogue as well. The single DVD has a 6 or 7 page book inside the case with pics and liner notes on the DVD. I liked the special features section of the DVD, especially the cut-out scenes from the movie, and the Steve Winwood/Traffic song 'Here We Go 'Round The Mulberry Bush'. I had heard about this song, but didn't know it had been considered for the MMT film. So 4 stars for the remastered MMT film.",1349568000,11,3130,4.378006872852234

And to augment them, the film is packed with super 8 footage (and outtake photos) of the Beatles.  So what if you don't hear the Beatles performing Magical Mystery Tour songs?  We all own the album.  But who has ever seen these home movies of the trip?  As a bonus, Neil Innes shares the origin of ""Death Cab For Cutie.""

Geez, people, have a heart.  This is actually the most I've ever learned about what actually happened on the Magical Mystery Tour.  All the bios say, nothing much, and share nothing much as a result.  And, indeed, nothing essential DID happen for the band, or for rock historians looking for sordid details.  The magic was for the locals, and it was The Beatles themselves, coming to town with miraculous randomness, then disappearing.  And apart from John snubbing one hotel worker's autograph request, it looks like they were actually having a good time hob-nobbing.

To echo one reminiscing passenger's suggestion, it really is too bad they didn't incorporate the incident of the bus getting stuck on a small stone bridge (holding up their caravan and 30 cars of traffic) into the film.  You'd think ""the boys"" might've appreciated the absurdity.

I'm glad this was made.  And it's exactly what it says it is on the box (right down to, there are no Beatles performances in this film).  In fact, there was far more footage of the Beatles than I expected.  Thumbs up from here.",1349568000,4,1746,4.708609271523179
314610,5,6301095294,"This Review is for the box set edition of  The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour 2012 release. I have used  the basic content in order as listed in the press release and on the box itself and will elaborate on it based on my viewing of  both the Blu Ray and DVD  set which I was lucky enough to receive on October 5th.
 The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour is basically their 1967 home movie which bewildered audiences at the time.
Today it allows us to look back at a time when the Summer of Love seemed endless and possibilities were limitless.
This box set contains the DVD & Blu-Ray, as well as a very nice softcover 60 page book with background information, photographs and production notes. The book also contains period reviews of the film,which were not so kind.and also includes a faithful reproduction of the mono double 7"" vinyl EP of the films six  Beatles songs. The discs are pressed in the USA on reproduction Parlophone labels.,and mirror the original  British issue which accompanied the films 1967 TV premiere. The EP is remastered,possibly from the 2009 Mono Masters set,but I'm not sure.

Special Features include:

Director's Commentary - by Paul McCartney. Very anecdotal,with several interesting McCartneyesque quips,and some sharp barbs at BBC censors.

The Making of Magical Mystery Tour (19m 05s) - Features interviews with Paul and Ringo, along with other cast members and crew. Includes unseen footage. Very enjoyable,and adds some much needed background to the proceedings

Ringo the actor (2m 30s) - Ringo describes his role in the film and mentions his other acting experiences.

Meet The Supporting Cast (11m 27s) -  Nat Jackley, Jessie Robins, Ivor Cutler, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Victor Spinetti, George Claydon, and Derek Royle are profiled. Again,not essential,but adds a little to the depth of the filmby way of additional outtake footage.

`Your Mother Should Know' (2m 35s)
`Blue Jay Way' (3m 53s)
`The Fool On The Hill' (3m 05s)
- These three songs are presented in previously unseen  edited editions.  These alternate versions will especially be interesting to Beatle collectors,as they have not been released officially or bootlegged. They are,however,not quite as crisp visually as the remastered film itself.

`Hello Goodbye' (3m 24s), as featured in Top of the Pops 1967
- The Beatles had the BBC  film them in the editing process  when they were working on Magical Mystery Tour. the resulting film was edited  to create a promo which was subsequently  broadcast on Top of the Pops.  Done in Black and white,this is a great addition to any Beatles collection and it also makes its DVD debut here.

Nat's Dream (2m 50s) - This deleted scene from the original film was directed by John Lennon  and features Nat Jackley.
 Of interest to Beatle collectors is the music soundtrack to this deleted scene,""Shirley's Wild Accordion"",a Lennon-McCartney instrumental composition,recorded at Abbey Road during the Blue Jay Way sessions on October 12,1967. and produced By John Lennon. This features Shirley Evans on accordion,Paul McCartney on maraca,with some incidental background yelling,and Ringo Starr on drums. Never released until now.

Ivor Cutler - `I'm Going In A Field' (2m 35s) - Cutler  is featured performing on a keyboard `I'm Going In A Field',  and it is the weakest of all the bonus material,.This deleted scene features no other cast members.

Traffic - `Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush' (1m 53s) -Traffic's excellent  `Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush',is slightly reminiscent of the Strawberry fields forever Beatles promo. It was commissioned by The Beatles who at one point planned to include it in the film. It survives today as an outtake.

All in all this box set is a beautifully packaged  commemorative edition,with the book containing a diary of events as they unfolded.
The DVDs are in a laminated  folder and individually enclosed in laminated mini sleeves for protection.
The vinyl  mono EP is also a faithful reproduction,but the sleeves seem a little too snug for the enclosed discs. The remastered film is beautifully reproduced ,both  visually and musically. I will have listen more closely to note sonic differences between the Blue Ray and the regular DVD.At present,to my ear The Blue Ray  5.1 stereo is about as good as it gets.
As far as the film itself,It should be looked at for what it is,53 minutes of the Beatles being themselves. That should be good enough for anyone.
As far as the price,I hedged a bit at first,but such a quality package makes it an essential purchase for the avid Beatle collector.",1349481600,14,4582,4.9828947368421055

The real magic is conveyed by the tunes alone. But such music wrapped up in material of this sort is beyond a real fan's dream. It does not matter that it was then considered a poor quality movie.

314675,4,6301095294,"This film was a stinkin mess when it was aired. My Dad made better home movies. And who knew it would be followed up by a chronicle of their break up? Among the many points categorically established, however, was that as a band, they were quickly becoming Paul's back up guys. The walrus was indeed Paul. As Ringo stated in the Harrison film, he and Lennon were always hiding from being called into the studio, and George took their absence to find the time he needed to explore and assemble tunes that would be rejected by L & M and then form the core of All Things. Harrison was finding the backbone to pursue his own interests as well and was learning how to keep Lennon & McCartney at arm's length.
They were a band and a business without a manager at this point, less than fully committed to marshalling on, and yet, for all that, the tunes they came up with were brilliant, musically, sonically and technically. It was a time when they were re-writing how to score a number 1 hit. To that end, this is mostly an extended and sloppy series of music videos.
I have the usual prurient interest in seeing the bits that were left out, but more importantly, hearing the music in blu-ray. The film can't help but be better having been re-authored for blu-ray, but it will be the enhanced depth and detail of great songs, at least from my youth, that will carry the day.

[review of this product to be inserted HERE]

.....................................................................

Addendum:

Roll the clock back to 1967.....

Imagine an alternate reality in which the Beatles were still getting along famously and the group was not disrupted by the sudden death of manager Brian Epstein (to quote George Harrison, ""by 1968 the rot had already set in""). Imagine it was acceptable for Beatles record singles to simultaneously appear on their respective albums. Now imagine the Beatles, after just releasing SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, have focused their efforts on making another fantastic album instead of becoming sidetracked by movie projects. Finally in 1968 they emerge with a psychedelic masterpiece to rival SGT. PEPPER'S. The end result is a double album - the definitive MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR album!

This revised and expanded collection of classics would consist of material recorded from the first SGT. PEPPER sessions (that didn't appear on that album) up to before THE BEATLES (White album) sessions. This includes all the songs from the original MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (American album/British EP set), the Beatles songs from the original YELLOW SUBMARINE soundtrack, the singles from this time period, plus unreleased instrumental music from the MMT soundtrack recorded by the Beatles. As a special limited edition release, how about a double gatefold vinyl LP mixed for that format (still arguably the best fidelity around today). The cover could be more psychedelic, perhaps in 3-D, the inside could contain special photos and text (why not from the original British double EP?) and maybe even a Beatles adventure/story about an alternate reality that lead to this album.

There's really no need for purist Beatles fans to get touchy with a little revisionist history since the whole project was pretty confused from the beginning. Had the Beatles maintained the focus they had with SGT. PEPPER'S they might have created the ultimate psychedelic album. In my view, this little idea of mine would come pretty close to achieving that.

With the following collection of songs, you can create one side of 5 songs and 3 sides of 4 songs. The first side could contain the original ""Flying"" instrumental while each remaining side could include ""Flying 2,"" ""Flying 3,"" and ""Flying 4."" The extra ""Flying"" tracks would consist of instrumental soundtrack material recorded by the Beatles and never before released on record (Beatles fans would no doubt love to get their hands on this stuff): ""Shirley's Wild Accordion a: Waltz b: Freaky Rock"" and ""Jessie's Dream."" Thus, you could have 4 sides of 5 songs each. Otherwise, there are a few other unreleased Beatles cuts that might be worth considering as well. Of course, the ""Flying"" idea could easily be discarded in favor of sticking strictly to Beatles' songs that have already been released.

Immediately following is my recommendation for the running order which I tinkered with and fine tuned extensively before creating my own copy. I found it useful to put 1 of George Harrison's 4 songs as well as original MMT songs on each side.

314747,1,6301095294,"The Beatles did so many great things in their time and they have held up extraordinarily well.  This, however, is a profound stinker.  Scriptless, witless, pointless and often flat out stupid - this was our first hint of McCartney's self-indulgent insipidness that would later become evident with Wings and many of his other projects.  The scene where he's dancing around during ""Fool on the Hill"" makes you cringe with embarrassment - you think, ""Were these guys HIGH?""  And the answer of course, is ""very.""

The extremely high quality of blue-ray is only going to make the crappy 16mm film look even more pathetic.  The songs, of course, are a different matter.  ""I am the Walrus"" is brilliant.  The rest are not bad - but certainly not among their best.  (Remember, the b-side of the album is not a part of the movie.  The MMT soundtrack was released as an EP in UK - in the US they added a second side with singles which beef up the album substantially.)

I mean, if you are a real die-hard Beatle trivia nut, you may want it.  But if you're not, you'll watch it once and put it away forever.  It is really, truly, completely, profoundly BAD.",1345939200,23,1146,4.5588235294117645
314748,5,6301095294,"If this is that which I think it is, I've been awaiting it since the first VHS from the 80's. I first saw it in NYC at the Philharmonic in '69. Seems that it's due to be restored with care. Yay!",1345852800,3,194,3.7560975609756095
314749,5,6301095294,"If anyone should ever doubt the Beatles greatness, this will NOT be the film to change their mind. It is a silly film. In fact, it is a very silly, very amateurish trifle. In fact it is downright bad. So why do I give it five big ones? Because it's The Beatles, of course. The Beatles were cranking it out for only seven years. There's a limited quantity of Beatles' product and that makes every bit of it precious!

Nevertheless, the casual viewer will probably be quite bewildered by this goofy curio of psychedelia. It has no script, no plot, and no acting to speak of.  So, if you've never seen it, go in with LOW expectations. First off, understand that this is not a Beatles feature film. It was originally presented as a one-hour Beatles TV special, nothing more. The first viewing is apt to disappoint; but repeat viewing are apt to be rewarded. It is not a ""good"" film (in fact it is a ""bad"" film). But it is imaginative and energetic, it has its moments and it's Beatles!

For Beatles fans this lavish-attention release of MMT is way more than welcome! For the first time, we'll be able to see it in better than ""bootleg"" quality, much better! Just to hear the songs in remastered/remixed uncompressed (!) surround sound is reason enough to celebrate. Then there are the many extras and intriguing aspects (extra scenes? Songs ""re-edited""?). I can't wait!!

Addendum: Having now experienced the blu ray, I like Magical Mystery Tour even more than before. It has a hip quality. It moves fast. The songs, of course, are great; and the accompanying videos are equal to anything M-TV would produce. The greatly improved picture and sound lift the film up a notch or two. Now that it sounds good, even the incidental music contributes. Everything comes off better than before.
The Beatle music itself sounds particularly fantastic! It's been noted that the songs sound even better here than they do off the 2009 CD re-masters. I think that's true. And I think there are at least two good reasons: 1) This is what happens when you take your sound directly from the original multi-track source recordings and remix from scratch. 2)This is what you get when you refrain from adding compression in an effort to make the music sound ""louder"" (so it will sell in today's CD and mp3 markets).

I just wish ALL the Beatles' archive of music, films, and concerts were available in an equally superb presentation.",1345766400,156,2408,4.68321513002364
314750,5,6301095294,"I immediately pre-ordered the Blu-ray of Magical Mystery Tour - confident that the Capitol label and McCartney's personal involvement would guarantee this to be a genuinely fine high definition experience. 16mm film is capable of looking very impressive on Blu-ray (a prime example is ""Peter Gabriel - Secret World Live""). The quality of the restoration for this first official MMT release is truly astonishing - and that's in regard to both the video and audio. The main soundtrack is in either genuine stereo (i.e. not simulated) or a skillfully mixed and very impressive 5.1 surround.

Paul McCartney's commentary track is well worthwhile - he shares some interesting first hand knowledge in a very laid back manner. Ringo adds his comments to camera in the ""Making Of"" special feature, and there are archival comments by John and George.

I love this film not just because of the Beatles music, but also because it features my favourite Scottish artist, Ivor Cutler (as main character ""Buster Bloodvessel"") - I'm very happy to see that he performs in one of the bonus features. MMT also includes my clear favourite comedy music group, The Bonzo Dog Band singing ""Death Cab For Cutie"".

For any fan of Ivor Cutler, The Beatles and/or the Bonzo Dog Band, this official Blu-ray or DVD will be a invaluable addition to their collection.

Prior to this October 2012 release the only 2 DVD versions that had been available were transfers from very noisy film (with the out of print ""MPI"" release being vastly superior to the ""Avenue One"" atrocity).

MMT is a wonderful diversion - an eccentric delight which I've enjoyed 100 or more times over the years - and which I will enjoy even more in years to come.",1345766400,10,1704,4.862068965517241

314814,5,6301095294,"Some individuals explain in detail reasons for owning this DVD and why it is indispensable, but then abruptly do U-turns, proceeding to mock and dispose of it, as if it were ""garbage."" Some even label it as such. I am baffled by their explanations, some of which appear on the verge of anger - not straightforward, objective, or unemotional reviews. I don't get it. This is a fun album and film.

This film is art imitating art, not art imitating life - that might be where they appear conflicting and lost. MMT was a low budget film and period piece, not intended for the big screen or for your everyday ""Help!"" connoisseurs or screaming Beatle fanatics. That said, it is still essential art and goes hand-in-hand with the psychedelic landscape of the film's backdrop and the late sixties era in general, not to mention the album chuck full of sublime classics on MMT. There will never be another ""I Am the Walrus."" John Lennon even said MMT was his favorite album, ""because it's so weird."" Regarding the film, not the album, Paul bouncing around those hills with ""The Fool on the Hill,"" playing ever so sweetly, is not merely a must-see, but a must-own. There was nothing like that at the time in 1968. Like Monty Python, MMT is very British. For me, that is exactly what makes this special film so innovative.

It is clear some reviewers were not there and that truly makes me sad, because it was such a cool time. By being there, I mean being in the heart of the sixties rock music pop culture - in the moment, as only one could be by actually living, breathing, and soaking up the renaissance age - as this certainly was a renaissance during the height of the Beatles' symbolic writing period - ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" is loaded with metaphor. Unadorned screening of the film shows through in some reviews, which indicates to me some reviews of the film were from a literal perception, which the film is not intended to be viewed.

It bothers me that decades later some still Monday morning quarterback about the world of avant-garde, which they have neither experienced nor bathed in with all of their colorful senses, because they wear sunglasses to keep out the glare to reduce the inconvenience. Doing so, unfortunately reduces the color, too. There is something about fear of light that prevents our seeing its beauty from another perspective. This experimental art is now sadly taken out of context to be jammed into square pegs it has no business being forced into. I have never seen such limited view of beauty than I have in recent years, which permits me to spot green miles away. It is so unhip and un-cool that it startles me, because it signals to me it may be too impractical to explore art that was relevant and vital to a specific bygone era, which has now become homogenized to the extent we are slowly becoming sedated and numb to where we can no longer feel comfortable with it.

My recommendation is to buy this DVD and hold onto it dearly. Yes, it may be unusual. It may be bizarre. But, it is Magical and no mystery to me.

314818,2,6301095294,"The Beatles/ Magical Mystery Tour (DVD television special):  First of all, as of the writing of this review (in 2011) there does not exist a good quality transfer of this television special on DVD.  The DVDs and Tapes that exist today sometimes claim to be `remastered', which is a lie.  I hope that there will some day be a decent release of this show but until that release comes (if it ever does) do not bother buying any copy of this show.  As to the show itself, it was a huge disappointment when it was first show on television (back in the days when all television was in black and white) and the original Color version wasn't that much of an improvement.  However, with that being said, this is the best way to see the video versions of ""fool on the hill"", ""I am the Walrus"", and ""Blue Jay Way"".  For those moments alone, I hope that someone makes a good version of the show someday.

314820,1,6301095294,"I once bought a three-pack VHS collection of Beatle Movies that featured Hard Day's Night, Help!, and Magical Mystery Tour.  More enthusiastic about the other two--especially Help! because that's the kind of humor and plot I can relate to--I dragged my heels on MMT.  Fortunately, my niece watched it first and her verdict?:  ""It's so stupid it's like a retarded version of Sesame Street.""  Mind you, she was 12 at the time!  Despite her warning I put it in, and it was the beginning of counting down the longest 55 minutes I have ever sat through in my life.  Weird, plotless, and boring, I only sat through the entire thing because--just like a lot of other reviewers here--it was the Beatles.  So?  Just because you love an artist, actor, or musician doesn't mean you have to blindly love everything they do.  Well, I definitely don't love this.  If you're a completist, I'm betting you only have it just to have it.  That's okay, because I do that with artists like Basia.  If you're not, beware unless you only want to see the musical numbers.  Hey, up until 1980 or so, I grew up without too many musical visual aids and let my own imagination do its work.  There's my advice for you:  buy the soundtrack and let your own mind fill in visuals to your individual taste.  Unless this is given to you or it's super cheap, I wouldn't put it in my collection.  It's just too embarrassing for such a brilliant group to have sunk so cinematically low.  Guess psychedelics do a body good, huh?",1318809600,4,1491,4.541353383458647

The transfer is sad and tired, at times so overexposed there's barely a decipherable image.  From all accounts, Paul McCartney is credited (blamed) for the idea behind this misfire.  It was first shown in black and white in England on the day after Christmas.  (If this was meant as a Christmas present, I'd rather have coal.)
For that time period, it wasn't particularly daring, it certainly wasn't avant-garde or psychedelic.  Instead, it runs the gambit from a silly home movie to an amateur production done by a class of grade school students.  The graphics are slapdash, the `story' aimless, noisy, and confused.  Paul poses constantly, John showed up late, George appeared self-conscious, but at least Ringo looked like he was having a good time.  There's an odd sing-a-long on a bus, a stopover at a strip club, a creepy nightmare sequence in a restaurant, and a weird production number for the finale.  The only segment that was halfway decent was I Am The Walrus.  With only a handful of songs represented, it's almost not worth the effort, especially considering they shot almost 10 hours of film to end up with this embarrassing mess.
Still, it is The Beatles; reason enough to put in my collection for future viewing (when I'm 64).",1313366400,3,1336,4.799126637554585

The movie was filmed in Black and white and recolored, its broadcast on the BBC at premier, I believe was also black and white which was a total waste as the color aspect of the film is lost and hence its a snore fest.

Everyone is so strung out or post trip that really its a total shambles as far as any perceived plot. The only scene that gave me a laugh was of John shovelling spaghetti on a plate. Otherwise, the music scenes of I am the Walrus and The Fool on the Hill were a total waste even if you had dropped a blotter to relate.

I rarely post really really negative reviews, but in all honesty, save your money, this sucks in a supremely quantum fashion. It should be a one star, I gave it 2 because I love their music so much. Sure, everyone had taken acid or done drugs, thats not the issue. This is a rambling directionless film directed and edited in some futile hope that you get it and in reality there nothing to get, everyone basically trips their nads off and you have to see the genius in it.

(And a decade later we had George financing Python's first feature film `The Life of Brian', a true comedy classic.)

For me, the Beatles films served mainly to inspire the creation of more Beatles songs. Paul took a lot of heat for this project since it was not exactly a roaring commercial or critical success. But he kept the boys together and busy and writing and recording new songs--so good on Paul.

What really irks me is that some influetial critics, like the late Ian Macdonald, insist that the Beatles peaked with `Sgt. Pepper' and declined thereafter. I agree that they perhaps peaked with `Pepper'; I just don't believe there was EVER a decline afterward. The heart of the `Magical Mystery Tour' [MMT] album is `I Am the Walrus', an out-and-out masterpiece that rivals anything on `Pepper'. The only reason why MMT ever seemed a bit of a dip was packaging: The non-album `Yellow Submarine' deprived MMT of excellent tracks such as `It's All Too Much' and `All Together Now'. A charity album swiped the George Martin version of `Across the Universe'. And `Lady Madonna' and `The Inner Light' were left off.

In fact, the Beatles' material from that era was so good that you could add `Strawberry Fields Forever' and `Penny Lane' to `Pepper' as a prelude (as they were originally intended) and `All You Need is Love' as a `summer of love' addendum, and there would still be enough left over for a glorious MMT sequel to `Pepper'.

The `Hey Jude/Revolution' and `White Album' period that followed was anythjing but a ""coming down."" Next came the `Get Back' sessions, which provided all the material required for an absolutely brilliant `live' album featuring the raw feed of the 6 best tracks from the rooftop, but this opportunity was squandered. More brilliance followed with `Abbey Road', their most sophisticated studio album and George Martin's favourite. ""Coming down, Mr. Macdonald?"" I think not.

Then in 1973 came the greatest pop album-set of all time--'Black Box' (1973) alias `The Black Album', with a mind-boggling 46 tracks. Except that--the music was never released in that package. You have to put it together yourself because EMI/Apple ain't up to the task. The Beatles as the `Beatles Releasing Collective' could be said to have recorded more-or-less separately but released collectively right through to 2010. You can bring the resulting six album-sets + into existence yourself. There was never a `coming down', and it was never over.",1301184000,,2694,4.977777777777778

The horrible sound, vaccuous, drug-induced lyrical crud and lack of real musicality signals this vomit as possibly rivalling the Bee Gees Sgt. Pepper's film as the worst rock film of all time. At times dressed in plushy outfits and filmed in the oh-so-blah countryside on oh-so-blah grey days, the four Beatles indulge themselves in being the cutesy and oh-so-witty(because we WROTE it that way) boy-band of their era. The result is the same as with every film that vainly tries to promote a band that is uninspired: a trash heap. The songs stand as simply the least well-performed and least interesting of all of the Beatles' repertoire. ""Fool on the Hill"" is a drab, lack-lustre experiment with pseudo-melancholic tonal structure and forced psychedelic-cool nonsense lyrics.

It's just not entertaining, nor is it featuring any truly strong songs.

The reliance on Brit terms (""Roll Up"") gets as boring as listening to another treatise on Brittania's rightful role. Lennon strings some poorly-conceived chord exchanges in a drab production of his (famous?) ""I Am The Walrus."" ""Strawberry Fields"" has no reference visually in this trash film.

No script, no thought, no concept... this film pales in comparison to the other films by this most-important group. I recommend ""A Hard Day's Night"" or even ""Help!"" before wasting your time getting this trainwreck.

This newly produced hour long documentary on the making of the Beatle's third film - ""Magical Mystery Tour"" - can be highly recommended to TRUE Beatles fans who want ALL the inside info. (These are the folks who covet every CD made of news conference interviews with the Fab Four). For those who remember seeing the film once, or have never seen it at all, it's worth an hour to watch, though references made by the interviewees won't mean much.

Show on high quality video, the documentary is ""hosted"" by Victor Spinetti, the British actor who appeared in all three Beatles films. He is personable. With two or three exceptions, the persons telling their ""memories"" are individuals who happened to live in Cornwall when MMT was filmed in 1967. There is the man whose father owned the smal newsstand and the local policeman who had his 15 seconds of fame in the film. We learned how the Beatles were just ""regular folks."".

The two ""names"" in this doc are musician Spencer Davis, who tells a few good short stories, and Neil Innes from the Bonzo Dog (Doo Dah) Band, who actually sings a song. (The rest of the music in the film consists of instrument versions of MMT songs - none performed by the Beatles.)Oh yes, we get Paul McCartney's brother, Mike, - who is back to using the family name after many years as ""Mike McGear), mostly slumming off of his sibling's reputation.

There are 11 short interviews on the DVD as ""bonus material).

A nicely done package, but as I said above, really aimed at the Beatles completist.

Yes the story really doesn't come together (maybe a better ending would have made it good) but the songs and performances are great!  Flying with it's psychedelic colors is wonderful.  Fool On the Hill with Paul on the countryside is great.  Blue Jay Way is just plain weird and kewl.  Also, you HAVE to see it for the only ever performance of I Am the Walrus.  Also, there is a part of another band in there called the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band.  The band is very closely tied to the members of Monty Python (Neil Innes of the band especially, who also wrote all those Rutles songs).  Paul did some producing for them, so he asked them to be in the movie.  Plus if you notice the song they sing is Death Cab For Cutie . . . now you know where that ""new"" band got it's name.

Like the many purported DVDs of ""Let It Be"", this looks a bit iffy.  I've seen VHS releases on MPI Home Video in the '80s, which used to also have the US video rights to what some fans consider the Beatles' only two real movies (we all know which ones!), as well as a few TV specials.  It would make sense if Apple and Abbey Road Interactive (formerly Picture Music International, Capitol/EMI's home video arm) reissue it themselves like they just did ""Help!"".  The bonus features could be the videos (then short films) for most of the B-side of the US LP, and lost footage (I've heard there's some out there).  Maybe interviews with supporting cast members like their old friend Victor Spinetti (who plays the speed-screaming recruiting Seargent [not Pepper!]) in one memorable scene) and Nicola could seal the deal.
The movie is cinema verit to sum it up simply.  There's no script or feasible plot.  An assorted cast of characters.  Costume changes, early music videos, a stripper, a pub on wheels, maybe some acid and such, a document of the age.  Some people may have assumed Magical Mystery Tour was a live tour, though those stopped the previous year, as we all know.  You have to take it for what it is.  A lot of what happened at this time is well documented in Beatle lore like the rest.
I think that The Who's US label Decca/MCA must've ripped off the concept for the ""Magic Bus"" LP cover just to cash in (Paul McCartney and Pete Townshend are famously friends).
This aired in late 1967 on Boxing Day (the day after Christmas for those of us outside the Commonwealth) in black and white on BBC 1 (not everyone had a colour TV in those days!).  The critics finally had a chance to let the Beatles have it.  This was the generation gap, of course!  It was their first failure since making it, proving that life is not a success-only journey.  It was aired in colour a week later, but the damage was done.

315424,5,6301095294,"Magical Mystery Tour is a superb, mostly surrealistic film produced by The Beatles. Magical Mystery Tour employs all sorts of technological tricks, fantasy and reality to produce an appealing motion picture that you won't forget anytime soon--it's THAT good. The DVD is a print copied from film taken several decades ago, so prepare yourself for a DVD experience that's not exactly digital. The film works well anyway.

The film opens with Ringo and his Aunt Jessie getting onto the Magical Mystery Tour bus--late, after just about everybody has boarded. Ringo and his Aunt Jessie ham it up big time with petty arguments that are rather well acted by the both of them. We are introduced to Wendy, the attractive tour guide and another gentleman who also guides the tour. Alf, the driver, is present only in name.

The tour gets underway--and that's when the ""magic"" begins. We are guided through the English countryside, seeing it in multiple colors and hues just as one might if they were stoned on some drug. We also see the tour guides gently poking fun at more traditional tours by pointing out to the tourists some old ruins from ancient times that, of course, are impossible to see no matter how hard you look.

Along the way the action gets accompanied by the songs of the Magical Mystery Tour record album; this music provides an excellent accompaniment to the fantasy and ""magical"" experiences. Look for Aunt Jessie to be served spaghetti by John Lennon dressed as an Italian waiter; and there's a scene in which the members of the tour disembark and crawl through a tent tunnel that leads them into a movie theater! I was reminded of the genius of the film Being John Malkovich when I watched this part of the movie.

There are also a few segments of the film that simply feature the band as themselves; look for an excellent performance of ""I Am The Walrus"" and ""Your Mother Should Know"" closer to the end of the film.

It's also interesting to note that on the tour there seem to be no boundaries about who may participate: we see persons young and old, slender and heavyset, short and tall. We also see nutty characters like Mr. Bloodvessel and more mainstream types including the male tour guide.

Overall, this movie is an impressive fantasy journey through time and space without limits. Many scenes are surrealistic; and they work well to bolster the film. The plot is razor thin but you'll never notice because the film is so much fun to watch.

I highly recommend this film for Beatles fans; and people who enjoy surrealistic art will appreciate this film as well.

315463,5,6301095294,"Five stars for the original film, but only two stars for this DVD.

This DVD is in acceptable video quality - but it shows video artifacts which indicate that it was saved at one stage in the transfer to DVD as an inferior quality ""SVCD"" file. An A/B comparison shows that my 1988 MPI VHS has vastly superior video quality - and the colours are much richer.

The problem with the MPI VHS was that it was all in HiFi mono (even though the cover claimed it to be stereo) - and the songs were dubbed from only the left channel of the stereo recordings (so they all sounded odd).

This DVD has clearly had a stereo effect applied to the dialogue and incidental sounds, but the Beatles songs sound very much as if they were transferred from original master tapes at Abbey Road Studios, as is claimed on the DVD. The Bonzo Dog Band track ""Death Cab For Cutie"" has been given the same phony sounding stereo effect as the dialogue (and they're miming to their original album track - which was in excellent stereo).

There's no good reason why this DVD couldn't have at least looked as good as the 1998 MPI VHS. It really is only just worth the budget price being charged in Australia (approx. US$8)

One major point of value in this film is that it contains the only feature film appearances by both Scottish performance poet Ivor Cutler and The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Magical Mystery Tour may be silly in places, but that's just par for the course considering everyone involved - and it's about the best quality silliness you'd ever expect to see.

My favourite musical sequences are ""Flying"", ""I Am The Walrus"" and ""Death Cab For Cutie"" (by the Bonzos).

People might be tempted to quibble about minor errors (like synch in ""Blue Jay Way"") in the film's editing, but at least the music is all here in its glorious stereophonic entirety - and this version may be as good as we're likely to get as a DVD release.",1159660800,6,1905,4.441260744985673

So don't expect HD clearity, not by a stretch. What you do have here is a prestine copy of MMT, primarily shot from hand-held, somewhat primitive equipment, at least by today's standards.

None-the-less, there's a warmth and a subtle charm in watching the boys in one of their very last video performances. They ham it up with the same sort of wreckless abondament which won us over with on A Hard Day's Night and Help. Consider this, Magical Mystery Tour preceeded M-TV by at least twenty years and can be seen almost as a prototype of that format.

And finally there's the sublime soundtrack: I Am The Walrus, Your Mother Should Know, Baby You're A Rich Man, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields Forever, Fool On The Hill, Penny Lane, Flying, (The Beatles one and only instumental) and George's pyscidellic sitar opus Blue Jay Way.

315468,3,6301095294,"""Magical Mystery Tour"" is a 50 minute or so TV special that the Beatles shot and directed in 1967, and originally was shown on Boxing Day in that year in England. John, Paul, George, Ringo and his aunt take a tourist bus around England, a ride where anything can happen, and some of that anything does. The many adventures they have include a foot and car race, watching a movie in a tent bigger on the inside than the outside, a stripshow, and a singalong on the accordion.

The first CD I ever bought was ""Magical Mystery Tour"" by the Beatles, and I loved the music. I used to think to myself, ""Wow, the film that goes with this soundtrack must be amazing."" I'd seen the video clip for ""I Am The Walrus"" and thought it was pretty neat. I wondered what the rest of the film would be like. I imagined a great little dance sequence with Paul singing to children in ""Your Mother Should Know"", I imagined lots of colour and wonder. A few people I knew didn't like it (they said that nothing happened in it) but I was sure it couldn't have been as bad as all that. I finally got my hands on a copy the other day and had a look.

Basically, it was better than my friends said it was, but still not nearly as good as I'd imagined it would be.

The music is, of course, great. Energetic drumming on the title track, nice early use of flange on ""Blue Jay Way"", ""Fool of the Hill"" is nice and whimsical. I could live without the ""Death Cab For Cutie"" song though, an Elvis-ish song sung during the strip show by some sleazy looking fellow (from the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah band).

There's a lot less of the actual Beatles than I expected, and hardly any Beatle banter. They're passengers, they're wizards too, but the film doesn't really seem to be focused on them. What is the plot focused on? It's hard to say, it's all very weird, but not in a colourful Yellow Submarine or a funny Monty Python way. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. Things will be happening on the tour and then they'll cut to a music video. The music feels a little tacked into the plot, which is a strange thing to do for a Beatles film. The music videos aren't too shabby though. I quite liked the ones for ""I Am The Walrus"" and ""Fool On The Hill"".

For those who follow the ""Paul is Dead"" phenomenon, there's a couple of clues in this film. Paul wears a black rose while the other Beatles where red. The number of wizards is described by the narrator as four or five (a replacement for Paul perhaps). There's also the Walrus, of course. Personally, I reckon Paul's very much alive, and he'll probably outlive all the other Beatles, making these references very ironic.

Worth a look for Beatles fans, though I'd recommend seeing ""Yellow Submarine"" first. Definitely get your hands on the album though, the CD has all the Beatles songs from the film, plus classics such as ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""Penny Lane"" and ""All You Need Is Love"".",1149379200,5,2904,4.368518518518519
315469,4,6301095294,"Magical Mystery tour is a cool little film with some funny scenes and some good music. So what if it's ""weird"" or offbeat. It's the Beatles!

315470,4,6301095294,"In the Anthology series, Paul McCartney used this phrase to describe what the Beatles (Paul, mostly) were trying to create with Magical Mystery Tour.  The resulting product, shown in black and white on TV in Britain, was widely panned.  Some critics went so far as to say that the film was proof that the Fab Four had lost their shine.

Magical Mystery Tour was certainly no great cinematic work.  In fact, it's of virtually no consequence to anyone other than hard-core Beatles fans or stoners that like its psychadelic bent.

Whatever it lacks, it has a surreal, quirky charm that makes it worthwhile.  Some scenes are just plain bizaare, like the dream sequence in which John Lennon, a mustachioed waiter in a posh restaurant, shovels a table full of spaghetti onto a fat lady's plate.  Not surprisingly, Neil Innes of Rutles fame (or infamy, if you prefer) is in the The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, who performs the song ""Death Cab for Cutie"" -- recognize the name, kids? -- while a dancer does a striptease.  Only in trippy movies like Magical Mystery Tour, or its cousin, the Monkees' Head, can you see stuff like that.

Most of the movie is nonsense but some scenes are quite funny.  It's the kind of thing you'd expect if you asked a pot smoking pop group to put together a Monty Python episode.

If nothing else, the movie is, more or less, like an hour show of Beatles videos.  Nowhere else can you see videos of ""Fool on the Hill,"" ""Your Mother Should Know,"" and ""I am the Walrus.""  You know that can't be bad!",1146096000,6,1517,4.553505535055351

315542,2,6301095294,"MMT has long been one of my favorite Beatles' albums, and I was expecting this movie to be just as good.  After all, even though it originally bombed, a lot of other films which are now considered classics also did very poor business and got scathing reviews when they were first released.  Part of the reason why it originally got such horrid reviews was that it was shown in black and white, even though it had been shot in color and was really meant to be seen in color, like for some of the musical sequences.  You wouldn't get the full impact in black and white.  Just like there are some movies you can't picture being in anything but black and white, there are some movies that only belong in color.  This is one of them.  And it was also aired on Boxing Day, which wasn't the ideal day for most British people to be watching movies on television.  But even now that we can watch it at a more opportune time and see it in its original color, I still agree with the critics who originally lambasted it.  This really was a big ego trip for Paul.  He used to be my favorite Beatle, and he really does seem like a nice guy, but only a die-hard sycophant would deny that he does often come across as being a bit of an egotist and perfectionist, and trying to rewrite Beatles' history so that he comes across as the band's savior and the leading creative force, like when he once claimed that he, not John, was really the avant-garde one.  Writing a few songs like ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Fixing a Hole"" doesn't change the fact that many more of his songs were ballads and lightweight cheesy fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that type of music in moderation).

Anyway, this movie is nothing like YS, AHDN, or 'Help!'  It lacks their wit, humor, and fun.  Even most of the musical performances aren't as great as the ones in their other movies, despite the fact that we're talking about 6 really good songs here.  There doesn't even seem to be any plot to it at all.  The concept that was so common in England at the time, getting on a bus and taking a day trip to nowhere, might have played out better had there actually been some substance to this film.  Basically all we see are some musical performances, some dream sequences, a few scenes of The Beatles dressed up as wizards in a laboratory, Ringo fighting with his Aunt Jessie, and the tourists doing not much of anything exciting.  I normally love surrealism, psychedelia, and all things avant-garde, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  There were some nice avant-garde and surreal scenes, like the ""Flying"" sequence, but they were overwhelmed by the lack of a plot and substance.  This is even worse than a bad home movie, although since The Beatles are in it, it can't be completely dreadful.  If you want to see a psychedelic, surreal, avant-garde, drug-influenced movie from this era, see something like 'Yellow Submarine' or 'Head.'  Those movies might be really weird too, but at least they have substance and plots, and inspired imagery and themes.",1142467200,5,3028,4.519266055045872

Now that I own it, I can honestly say I understand why it took so long to release it to the public.  That thirty years of isolation, locked up in a vault somewhere in London, only improved its standing in my imagination, not on actual film.  The BBC was right to bury this.  As a film, or television special, it's horrible.

But as a fan, I had to have it.  Now, that's all I can say about it; I own it.  When will Let It Be be released?",1142208000,4,717,4.064285714285714
315544,2,6301095294,"Those who read this review are, no doubt, familiar with every word, note, and film frame of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.  In short, the DVD transfer is horrible.  Granted, the original 16mm film was not a professional job either, but this DVD appears as if it was derived from a very poor copy of the Beatles' film.

I have seen MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR in many formats.  Years ago I found a 16mm film copy in the library.  I borrowed this print several times.  The the picture was very clear, but the sound was poor.  Later I bought a VHS copy through MEDIA.  The original VHS copy was about the same quality as the film, except that it was convenient to play on a video cassette recorder.  Still later I bought a ""remastered digitally enhanced"" VHS copy.  The picture was about the same as previous editions, but the sound was greatly improved.

Recently I bought the DVD release.  I was somewhat concerned that the DVD did not display the Apple Logo, but I had heard that this film drifted into the public domain a few years ago.  I was sadly disappointed at the quality of the DVD.  Nothing was done to improve this copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.  The color is washed out, picture is grainy, and the sound is worse than the original 16mm film.  About the only benefit of the DVD is that enjoys the semi-permanence of being on DVD and you can jump from chapter to chapter.

As for the film itself, this was the Beatles first attempt -- outside of some of their music promos -- at making a film.  It was designed to be for television, so it was captured on 16mm color film.  The plot is simple: The Beatles and friends load onto a bus to take a sight-seeing tour of England.  These tours were standard fare for Brits in the late 1960s.  Along the way the passengers and crew of the bus encounter some odd scenery and situations.  In between there are some great Beatles musical numbers.

Okay, the film itself is not Oscar material.  It is more like something you would expect from someone showing off a new home movie/video camera.  However, it is classic Beatles.  There was not much of a script for this movie and John, George, Paul and Ringo all took part in the production.  Apparently all four Beatles were involved in the editing, though never at the same time.  As such, the film took on conflicting directions depending on who was in the editing room.  Paul even slipped in his solo ""Fool on the Hill"" promo from Southern France.

We have all heard the legend.  This film bombed on British television.  It was broadcast in black and white.  Later it was rebroadcast in color in a bad time slot.  Worse yet, the film was blown up to 35mm and premiered in theaters.  Still, it heralded the creation of Apple.  All four Beatles would be involved in numerous other film projects and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was good experience.

If you do not already have a VHS copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, I recommend that you wait for Apple to re-release a restored copy.  On the other hand, the DVD is affordable.",1139616000,4,2993,4.474074074074074
315545,1,6301095294,"This review is for anybody who enjoyed Yellow Submarine, A Hard Days' Night, or even Help! and is thinking that this would be a good, enjoyable follow up.

Think again. The most egregious mis-step in the Beatles' career, this thing is, despite sporadic musical brilliance, an interminable mish-mash of stagey home movies, pretentious avant-garde hoo-ha (wrestling midgets! Chroma-key effects! Strippers!), and badly-acted skits.  The boys themselves, impossibly far from the fresh-faced naifs of A Hard Day's Night from just three years earlier, seem alternately bored (or, more likely, simply stoned beyond caring) and insufferably smug.

Others have commented on the terrible video quality, which is an artifact of the project's origin as a TV special using early portable color equipment, but it's the content that makes it truly unwatchable.

For the casual fan, this is simply a waste of time and money; any of the other Beatles movies or the CD soundtrack (or any other Fabs album for that matter) would be a more worthwhile investment.  For the budding Beatlemaniac, note that almost all the worthwhile bits from this film are included in the Anthology DVD set, including the proto-videos for ""I Am the Walrus"" and ""Your Mother Should Know"" (The other musical highlight is the instrumental ""Flying"", but the visuals here are nothing but tinted landscapes, so buy the CD and close your eyes and you won't have missed anything); far better to put your money towards a copy of Anthology than suffer through the drek here to get to the songs.

315753,4,6301095294,"I can understand why Magical Mystery Tour has been the victim of so much harsh criticism.  One thing that film purists may complain about is the amateurish style of the camera and editing.  However, Paul himself pinpointed the biggest trouble with the film back in the day:  people were looking for a plot, but there wasn't one.  But Magical Mystery Tour isn't a ""regular"" movie.  The beauty of this film is that it's a complete fantasy and therefore a real, developing plot isn't necessarily needed.  One legitimate shortcoming of the film is that it is a Beatles movie, yet it's actually not self-indulgent enough.  The Beatles admitted that they were like bit players in their own movie, which is mostly true.  The Beatles, along with Mal Evans, each play a character on the bus (only Ringo's character has more than a few lines, though) as well as the ""4 or 5 magicians"" who cause the magic to happen.  (John also serves as narrator, among a couple other one-scene characters.)  The other characters get about equal exposure as the Beatles (not including the songs themselves).  It's been put around that, because Magical Mystery Tour was largely Paul's idea, the movie revolves around him, which is completely untrue--I don't believe that his ""bus"" character even says one word on-screen thoughout the whole movie.
Magical Mystery Tour is less than an hour long.  There are a few scenes which are a bit too silly, but there's also plenty which are enjoyably funny:  pretty much anything Ringo says to his auntie, Victor Spinetti's two-minute mumbo-jumbo speech, and, of course, the spaghetti dream.  Naturally, however, the highlights of the film are the songs!  The Beatles had been making promotional films (AKA ""music videos"") for their singles for over a year, and the visuals for these songs were the best-looking yet (the sequences for ""Fool On The Hill"" and ""Blue Jay Way"" are particularly stunning).  If you need any proof that the Beatles spearheaded the style of music videos we know today, then watch Magical Mystery Tour!",1077062400,4,2038,4.932551319648094

They're not Richard Lester,(who directed ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help""), by any means. This was first a black and white tv special, that was later shown in color.  It's the first major project the Beatles did without Brian Epstein, (their manager who died in 1967), and it shows how important he really was. There are supposed to be a lot of ""in-jokes"" for people in the 'inner circle', but, the 'inner cicle' does not include the average person who will neither find the film funny, or interesting.  ""MMJ"" is the only real disaster the Beatles had, which isn't bad considering their large output from 1962 to 1970.

315756,1,6301095294,"It's pathetic to see so many reviewers parroting a bit of McCartney hype. In ""Anthology"" McCartney says he ""defends"" Magical Mystery Tour by pointing out that it includes the only performance of John Lennon's ""I Am the Walrus"" on film. In other words, he ""defends"" Magical Mystery Tour by blaming John Lennon for it. This is typical of McCartney's behavior since Lennon was murdered He deflects criticism of himself by issuing Lennon a backhanded compliment. In any case, the most obvious problem with his remark is that there is NO performance of ""I Am the Walrus"" here. The scene in question can't even be called lip-synching considering that the mouths of the Beatles are obscured by animal masks.
According to Rolling Stone (December 14, 1967), ""The original idea to make a TV film about a bus tour was Paul's. He thought it up in April while on a week's vacation in America and started to work out the song, `Magical Mystery Tour' on the plane back to London."" The film was shown on BBC television on December 26, 1967. The British papers called it ""Chaotic, appalling, naive, puffle, flop, tasteless, contemptuous, nonsense."" A front page review in the Daily Express allowed, ""I cannot ever remember seeing such blatant rubbish."" According to Rolling Stone (February 1968), ""The visual ideas of the wonderful 'I Am a Walrus' are literal -- there are lots of egg men and a walrus, but the film tries to move the way the song moves, so that one finds a silly one-to-one relationship between the juxtaposing of sections in the song and the editing of the filmed scene.""
At the time McCartney defended the film by remarking, ""It was a mistake because we thought people would understand that it was 'magical' and a 'mystery tour.' Maybe we should have had someone saying: 'We are going magical now, folks.'"" By the time of ""Anthology"" he seemed to have abandoned that line (it was pretty feeble anyway), but we nevertheless have reviewers here parroting IT as well.",1071964800,5,1966,4.819526627218935

315762,3,6301095294,"This is a McCartney project from the get-go. On the heels of Brian Epstein's untimely demise, Paul felt a need to show the world the Beatles still had a sense of creative autonomy. In actual truth, the germ of inspiration for MMT came to PM while they were still making Sgt. Pepper. The resulting acid-tinged filmed bus excursion through the scenic (yet unsuspecting) English countryside was a ""splendid time guaranteed for all...."" (""all"" EXCEPT maybe the ENTIRE brittish TV audience that tuned in to watch it on Boxing-Day, 1967 and were collectively aghast, it seems) Widely known as the Fab's first and ONLY ""failure"", the Magical Mystery Tour film is nevertheless HISTORIC on several levels. But there are misconceptions to clear up : Firstly, it has been interminably criticized for being ""plotless"" and ""scriptless""------but what people don't understand was that THIS was Paul's precise INTENTION. It was made during the height of PSYCHEDELIA (a phenomenom the Beatles THEMSELVES helped to usher in earlier that same year with the advent of their magnum opus ""Sgt. Pepper's"") Working class people in the North of England--of the same ilk the Beatles themselves arose, would frequently take leisurely coach trips or day journeys on weekends into the country. They were called ""Mystery Tours"" --- because more often than not, the passengers were kept uninformed as to the journey's final destination...it was kept a ""surprise"" or, ""mystery"". Paul's idea, according to his well-written autobiography ""Many Years From Now"", was to make a hippie-era, psychedelic variation on this theme...and call it a ""MAGICAL Mystery Tour"" (the LSD implication was obvious-- and I'm SURE he was cognizant of Ken Kesey's trans-continental bus ""trip"" across the US that took place three years earlier with the ""Merry Pranksters"") As with the conventional ""Mystery Tour"" passengers, the motley assortment of circus freaks and hangers-on that accompanied the Lads from Liverpool on THEIR version were ALSO not told of the final ""destination"".... but did anyone care ??? Hell NO!! THAT was the very point. Paul was INTENTIONALLY paying homage to the French new-wave avante-gaurde film directors he apparently admired so much privately. The clueless and UNsavvy English film critics establishment at the time couldn't figure out WHAT the point was. The ""point"" was it was supposed to be a 60's ""happening""...a ""non-event"" that was filmed. On THAT level it certainly DID succeed. The film is now widely credited for offering the first self-contained ""music videos""--- an innovation the MTV GENERATION owes to Sir Paul directly. Disjointed, aimless and self-indulgent a relic as it may appear to many, Magical Mystery Tour is also deemed a bold, inventive and whimsical piece of Flower-Power Age ART (in the Peter Max tradition) that is appreciated more and more as it ages (albeit UNgracefully), and gathers a larger and larger cult following.

The music is, of course, absolutely impeccable and the videos are so much more engaging than current MTV fare. In fact, the clip for I Am the Walrus-- with its dancing ""eggmen""-- may just be the coolest, most off-beat song promo ever filmed. The spot for Fool on the Hill --with Paul gazing high atop the Pyrennes-- is absolutely beautiful and quite befitting of that elegant song. Also, you just gotta love that silly wizard garb the guys break out for their performance of the title song. On the downside, the DVD itself is subpar. The picture, in dire need of remastering, is inexcusably grainy. Quite frankly, the film looks like a cheap VHS transfer. So why 4-stars for a plotless movie wrapped in a lousy DVD presentation? One word: MUSIC! More specifically, great Beatle music. That is the saving grace of ""Magical Mystery Tour"".",1005696000,26,1561,4.850187265917603

However, Magical Mystery Tour was something I can't imagine why they did it.  I know the Beatles wanted control of their artistic ability especially after Brain Epstein's death.  In Hard Day's Night, the Beatles were fun and amusing, in this film they were wierd.  I know Beatle humor has always been off beat, but they were really off beat this time.  The scene where the Aunt being scowled by her boyfriend in a stoned looking atmosphere was a nightmare.  This was the Beatles' farse.  The music was great, as all Beatle music was great, but the Beatles' really had no business making this film.  They are too great to have done this.",1005091200,3,752,4.593984962406015

I have the DVD, and let me tell you, that is the ONLY way to go, if you want to own this. That way, you don't have to watch the whole movie, if you just want to enjoy the music.

(Did you know that they were going to release this as a full length feature film? Were they tripping?) For years, this film was not available, and BEATLES fans, who were not old enough to see it in 1967, had to contend to hearing second hand from hippies, about what the film was like. WEll, now you don't need some burn out trying to remember their mescaline trip, to discover what the film was about. Now, if NEMS would only release LET IT BE, life would be complete, eh?

It certainly wasn't what the folks at home were used to for their holiday television. In hindsight, we can see ""Magical Mystery Tour"" for what it is: a slightly sluggish but fanciful art film, filled with engaging music videos and bits of offbeat comedy. This film predates MTV by a good 13 years, and includes great Beatles recordings (I strongly recommend the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" soundtrack album.)

Seen as separate music videos, the songs all hold up. They're also slightly remixed from the way they eventually appeared on the corresponding album, so that's kinda neat.

315900,4,6301095294,"When I first saw this film I simply couldn't understand why so many people ganged up to trash it. I've seen it two more times since then with friends and my opinion has only strengthened.
To me this is a far more interesting film than overrated boomer nostalgia like a ""Hard Day's Night"" because it gives a better look into their personalities--this is their film, and the truest test of just how much you're on the Beatles' wavelength, which means a liking for Goon-show type humor and pop surrealism. Therefore people who expect every movie to have a ""point"" or nice understandable plot should go back to kino-kindergarden and skip the film. (The sort of people who beat words like ""self-indulgent"" and ""weird"" into the ground to describe what isn't instantly understandable) MMT is basically a set of music videos loosely held together by the various goings-on during a Ken Kesey-esque coach trip. And at 55 minutes it's too short to be boring anyway. The entire point is to sit back and not bother--to quote Bob Dylan--shoveling each dream into the ditch of what each one means.
The film of course has large flaws. There are quite a few comic situations, but the Beatles don't really develop them.(John and George are more out of it than Ringo and Paul too.) Some of the lightly sketched sequences do drag a bit as a result. But the movie's strength lies in its resolute silliness--like an overlush, parodic seaside ""love affair"", John dressed up as an Italian waiter endlessly shoveling mud-like spaghetti for a obese woman, or the Beatles capering around in wizard's outfits like kids who've eaten too much sugar. That silliness shades into genuine pop surrealism with the primitive, excellent videos for ""I Am the Walrus"" and ""Blue Jay Way,"" featuring the most captivating use of superimposition, odd props in even odder locations, children, extreme lighting, and fleet-footed but purposeful intercutting.(McCartney made for an occasionally clumsy but effective director) They live up to the mood of the songs--they seem genuinely dream-like and make a good match with the Beatles' captivating videos for ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane."" Those videos, especially the former, freaked parents out in their day, and an extended music video like ""Magical Mystery Tour"" still manages to irritate people to this day.

A colorful (psychedelic, at that) film is now flat and washed out, the print itself speckled and grainy. This film cries out for restoration!

It could  have been a masterpiece, but ended up being an innovative (but sometimes  weird to the point of boring) film by a bunch of amateurs.

Pepper; a TV special, written and directed by the Beatles themselves, where they would board a bus with a bunch of crazies and film whatever happened.  Now, on album, the Beatle's are unsurpassed, but they knew little to  nothing about making their own film and it shows.  This is a weird,  improvised movie that despite a great soundtrack seems a lot longer than it  is.  The nonmusical sequences are sloppy, with everyone talking at once and  no one sure where they are going next.  The musical sequences range from  good to bad.  George's ""Blue Jay Way"" is the best musical sequence, despite  being one of the weaker songs, and John's ""I am the Walrus"", gives you  images that are as strange as the song.  The worst has to be ""Your Mother  Should Know"", where the Beatles shuffle around in a big Busby Berkeley like  production that only emphasizes what an amateurish project MMT is.  This shouldn't dissuade you from buying the soundtrack, which is very good,  especially as it has several songs not in the movie.

But, if you are a fan of the Beatles, please note: the music on this video-tape (I don't know about the DVD) is a unique mix, and sounds  very different (and much better) from the MMT cd.  For instance, there is  an additional cello overdub on this version of Blue Jay Way.  Also, instead  of the tinny ""fake stereo"" effect on the second half of Walrus,  this version has it in full mono, a GREAT improvement! All of the other  songs are also considerably different on these special video mixes.  A true  Beatle fan will want these special remixes in their music library, no  matter what they think of the video itself.
What do I think of the video  itself?  For me, it's a chance to see the actual Beatles in 1967, walking,  talking, interacting, dancing.  That is pretty rare, as they made few  appearances that year.  However, here is precious little merit to the  actual film; the dialog(?) is poor, there is little humor, and John and  George seem very bored. But, as has been said so many times, it's the only  place to see Walrus, and the Flying and Your Mother Should Know sequences  are quite good as stand alone videos.  Fool on the Hill is innoculous; Blue  Jay Way is tedious. That's as videos, though.

316139,3,6301095294,"OK, OK.. I'll give it another chance.  I've only watched this movie once... 15 years ago, after which time I felt no need to ever see it again.  This, from a guy who's a bigger Beatles fan than Aunt Mimi.  However, I've  always thought the ""Walrus"" video was ground-breaking.. the  ""Fool"" segment intriguing.. and even the ""Your Mother Should  Know"" number well-orchestrated.  Now my 7-year old son is asking for  more Beatles stuff.. so here goes... OK.. GIVE IT TO ME ON DVD, BABY!  (Then I can always just punch to ""Walrus"" and skip the rest)  Plus, I guess it IS kind of funny when Ringo's aunt tells him to shut up on  the bus and he goes ballistic!",944179200,,654,4.411764705882353
316218,4,6301095294,"Magical Mystery Tour is more interesting not for what it was but for what it would become. It was a musical video album before MTV; a series of Monty Python skits before Monty Python's Flying Circus first hit the air; a  performance by an Elvis impersonator before the King died and his  impersonators were everywhere.
One can wish that Richard Lester had  directed it, or that the Beatles had actually given Federico Fellini a call  to direct it since it's obviously an homage to him; or even that Terry  Gilliam had been given this film as one of his first directing jobs.  It's  not as funny as it should be but that could just be my prejudice as an  American not tuned to the sensibilities of English Music Hall burlesque  skits.
Nonetheless, the Beatles' music was magical and this film contains  some of their best.",941673600,,821,4.6

Don't listen to the people who say it doesn't make any  sense,this is a great movie. Surely the best highlight,is when John sings I  am the Walrus. You,and your family will enjoy this film. So watch it!!!!",940636800,4,358,4.5625
316220,4,6301095294,"We can judge this film from a critical cynical point of view, and it'll be awful because it was a rush job. That's not the point. Watch the film with an open heart, enjoy the sillyness, enjoy the music, let the magic work on  you. We all need a bit of colour in our lives, and this film provides a  breath of fresh air, frees us from our normal hectic daily lives, and takes  us into a different world where we can be children again, jumping and  frolicking without a care in the world. In this context, the food dream and  the strip show scene are out of place, which is why I give only 4 stars,  but I nevertheless felt heartened and enlightened by the film. I'm glad I  bought it.",938995200,,683,4.128787878787879
316221,4,6301095294,"The Laserdisc remains the definitive version of this film.  A poorer quality film transfer is used (the color is very washed out on the DVD, while on Laserdisc it was much more vibrant) and for some odd reason the  opening sequence was altered, showing a zoom in and out shot instead of the  'stardust' after the opening titles and also the 'released' version of the  title track was used rather than the film's exclusive version, with the  spoken intro.
  For all those who are critical of the film's lack of  plot, you are taking the film much to literally.  Think of the dialogue as  a segueway between musical numbers (like a long form music video) and it  becomes much more impressive and entertaining.",934934400,5,707,4.666666666666667
316222,2,6301095294,".......The movie sucks.  It really has no point whatsoever, and I really think they were on drugs and experimenting wirth cocaine when they made this film.  If you really watch this movie it has no point, and is nothing  but a bunch of crappy stuff thrown together.  But not that I don't love the  Beatles. They are the best.  The album ""Magical Mystery Tour"" has  some of their best music.  But this movie isn't the best at all.  ""A  Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help"" have some sort of story to  them, and are excellent.",932774400,2,516,4.382978723404255
316223,5,6301095294,I found Magical Mystery Tour interested and well done.  It looks like a well-done home movie.  Although it does drag in the middle. It has a kind Monty Python flare to it.  My favorite songs were Fool on a Hill and I am  the Walrus.,930268800,,232,4.088888888888889
