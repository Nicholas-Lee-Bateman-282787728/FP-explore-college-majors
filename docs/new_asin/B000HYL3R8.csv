Sorry but that was the best scene in the movie it was not on the dvd got. Still very good.",1185148800,3,260,3.7454545454545456
8169252,5,B000HYL3R8,"Emanuelle in Bangkok is another of my favorite movies from late night cinemax years ago. This uncut version even has scenes you didn't see on cable, Emanuelle (Gemser) goes to the Orient (pleasuring men along the way) uncovering some kind of political problem by taking certain pictures she shouldn't have ...blah ...blah, c'mon it's got the lovely Laura Gemser, and Gabriele Tinti in it, do you really care about the plot? I just wish it had an english audio option or subtitles but the movie is still enjoyable regardless, especially the scenes with the ping-pong balls, and the naked bellydance. THE WHAT? THE WHO? Well, I see I've caught your interest...",1171584000,8,658,4.936936936936937
