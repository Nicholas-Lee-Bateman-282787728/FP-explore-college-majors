8220743,5,B000VZRLS8,"A must see for anyone with missing ancestors from Hudson Co, NJ, as well a history enthusiasts.  Be sure to have the tissues ready.  There is a very good chance my great grandfather is lost somewhere there as a 1930 census list someone with the same name and approximate age as a resident in the almshouse.  I can remember my mother mentioning ""Snake Hill"".  Even as a young child, I could tell that was not a good place for anyone to wind up, just from the sound of her voice when she mentioned the place.  I am glad that even though she never knew her grandfather, that she will never know he may be one of the many forgotten souls lost at Snake Hill. Worth watching!!",1468886400,,670,4.285714285714286
8220744,4,B000VZRLS8,Great documentary.  An accurate but sad portrayal of how things have operated in Hudson County.,1464652800,,95,5.333333333333333
8220745,5,B000VZRLS8,"What a crazy story! We live in the area and I heard of this from a neighbor. I did not believe it but when I looked into it, this video came up. I can't believe that we live just steps away from a huge historical area. The story behind this is amazing and this video did do a good job of explaining what used to be Snake HIll though a lot of the focus does tend to be on the building of the NJ turnpike. However, if you are interested in the history of Snake Hill and Secaucus, it's a good addition to the research.",1410825600,2,515,3.914285714285714

8220747,5,B000VZRLS8,"Saw this a few years ago with friends and was simply overwhelmed that this site in NJ that I had drove past so many times,  as a child with my parents and as an adult, had this amazing history!  How they were able to uncover and literally unearth this information without authorities and public officials aware that they were making this documentary is anyone's guess. This is a definite ""Must Watch""!",1360022400,,401,4.633802816901408
8220748,5,B000VZRLS8,"Fast Delivery, reasonable price. Something I have wanted to see since the article posted online years ago. I would always drive past what is left of the Hill driving on the highway and never quite  new what it was until now. Thank you for having this dvd available,",1355097600,,265,4.520833333333333
8220749,5,B000VZRLS8,"I was both fascinated and appalled by this documentary.  It seems impossible that an entire village such as this could simply disappear and be ""buried"" by the Turnpike.  I have given it to both my children (adults now) to view.  Highly recommend.",1325116800,2,246,4.809523809523809
