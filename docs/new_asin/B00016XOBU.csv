8007570,4,B00016XOBU,"In all fairness, I had to add my review. My daughter (10 yrs) has rented this movie twice from Hollywood where she gets it for 5 days and watches it every night of those five days. Obviously, it isn't as bad as the other reviewers would have you believe. It's apparently good enough that she asked for it for Christmas, as well. Is it as good as the other version by director David Wu? There really is no comparison. If you saw the theatrical version first, this one would likely be disappointing, as it would be if you expected it to meticuluosly follow the original fairy tale. However, it is entertaining to the young and deserving of viewing for those who enjoy cartoon fairy tales. She recommends it as one of the better movies for kids.",1099526400,8,742,4.463235294117647
