6860337,4,B00Q7SBAVW,"The Shield was one of the most violent trio in the history of the WWE that defeated even the best of the legends. Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns all became superstars after the trio broke up, due to a very unlikely break-up and betrayal. Roman Reigns soon rose to fame very quickly after their break-up.

This is definitely not for kids given the number of items being used such as steel chairs, ladders and tables and they do have to know that these athletes are professionally trained and despite that fact, there's still a degree of pain involved that's not suited for the ordinary being.",1424476800,,604,4.644859813084112
6860338,5,B00Q7SBAVW,"If you have the WWE NETWORK, don't buy it. It's the same Road to Summer Slam taping just with a different title. None the less at great video to watch, let's you in on the journey of each member of The Shield and how the came to be so dominant in and out of the ring.",1424476800,7,267,3.7857142857142856
6860339,5,B00Q7SBAVW,"The Shield was my favorite faction in WWE, so this was a must-have. Great documentary and very insightful interviews. Glad to finally have it.",1424390400,,142,4.958333333333333
6860340,5,B00Q7SBAVW,"Never before in history had individuals who made a name for themselves on the independent wrestling scene came through the WWE developmental territory living up to their hype only from there only to have such an impactful debut & build from there not only defeating but also taking out some of the biggest superstars & legends in WWE history to the point where they were either involved or main eventing PPV's both as a group & individuals as ""the Hounds Of Justice"" themselves in Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns also known as The Shield.  Now this was a unique presentation from WWE as the documentary portion was originally aired as a special presentation for the WWE Network only for it to now be released onto DVD with additional comments & footage (similar to a ""Director's Cut"" version of a movie) as the documentary featured comments from The Shield members themselves along with other personalities such as Paul Heyman, John Cena, Triple H, Daniel Bryan, Michael Hayes, Cesaro, Sami Zayn (formerly El Generico), former ROH employee & DragonGate founder Gabe Sapolsky, wrestling trainer & promoter Les Thatcher, Drake Wuertz (formerly Drake Younger), The Usos, John Laurinaitis, Billy Gunn, Terry Taylor, Bill DeMott, and William Regal.

Normally I give my summary at the end of the review but I'll just give it now in that the positives for this set are that they gave a slightly different presentation than the one already available on the WWE Network by adding more chapters & comments & using some different footage than before while WWE continued the trend of expanding outside of their ""universe"" to get additional footage & comments from those currently involved in other promotions (ROH/CZW/DragonGate) along with their own archives as this is the first time I can recall matches & footage from their FCW developmental & current version of the NXT brand used on a DVD presentation.  The only things negative I can say about the match selection is that I would have loved to see the six man tag with Orton & Kane & Bryan actually giving The Shield their first loss as a Blu-Ray replacement for the Payback tag match later in the week while I wish they didn't edited the finish of the Regal vs. Ambrose match or at the very least switch the camera angle so it wouldn't have been as noticeable but past that I have no complaints.

The documentary begins with various superstars describing what they think The Shield was & what each member brought to the group before going into each members beginnings from Seth Rollins' going from a backyard wrestler to Ring Of Honor & what went wrong there causing him to just say ""I'm going to WWE"" before talking about Dean Ambrose's training & work in both CZW & DragonGate along with his one specific talent that got him noticed by a specific WWE producer followed by Roman Reigns' background as far as his family lineage in wrestling to the point where he played high school football with two current WWE superstars & why ultimately his football career didn't work out in the end.  The instant chemistry & attention the Ambrose vs. Rollins rivalry in FCW was discussed next before going into each man's time in NXT from how Seth was the face of the new NXT brand but running into problems backstage to the point where he was almost fired & Roman's learning ability along with the frustration Dean was having including what went wrong with a planned feud he was scheduled to have with a Hall Of Famer.  The documentary continued talking about all three men forming The Shield & their immediate impact from their first appearance & debut match to the different top names & importance of the championships they held to each member before going into other important landmarks of the group such as their first Survivor Series & Royal Rumble matches along with the feud with Evolution followed by the reasoning behind the breakup to the group.  Each man's journey to SummerSlam was the focus for the rest of documentary discussing next along with what each superstar brings to the table as an individuals, each man's different training methods, analyzing their matches with one man saying about the Rollins vs. Randy Orton match, ""Orton made his name being a legend killer but now Orton's the legend & Reigns is the killer"", and following each man before & behind the scenes & after their matches with one superstar discussing the Rollins vs. Ambrose saying ""what's the last thing they'd expect"" in a lumberjack match before concluding on what's in the future for each man with one member saying it perfectly, ""friends or enemies, we're going to own the business.""

Matches Include (with a member of The Shield give a brief commentary about the upcoming match):
FCW 15 Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - It should be noted that the FCW 15 title were matches contested under ""ironman rules"" where the winner with the most falls within the 15 minute time limit was the winner while it was also pointed out on commentary that this was their first ever meeting.  They started out back & forth in the early moments with both men being very evenly matches as neither man had an advantage for very long as Seth resorted to his high flying style with offense coming off the top over over the top rope or a springboard position while Dean used his unorthodox methods of strikes along with strategy such as clawing & scratching at his back as both men continued to trade momentum down to the last second with the final statement left by one competitor ensured this was only the beginning.
""FCW"" Aug. '11

FCW 15 Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - This was the third match in their trilogy over the championship with the time limit being increased to 30 minutes while it should be noted that FCW Champion Bo Rotundo & Aksana & FCW General Manager Maxine were setting at ringside to watch this match.  Both them wrestled a very technical styles starting out while exchanging chops & forearms as they were evenly matched before one man decided to use the strategy of ""sacrificing"" to get the advantage as they continued to trade momentum as both men continued to deliver offense that not only hurt their opponents but themselves in the process as well while countering & reversing whatever their opponent gave them to where they literally wrestled into exhaustion in a wrestling clinic that ultimately came down to ""sudden death"" to the point where everyone from the fans to talents at ringside to even the announcers gave both men a standing ovation.
""FCW"" Sept. '11

Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins vs. Leakee - It should be noted how Ambrose gave William Regal at the commentary booth an acknowledgment before the match as Leakee was the odd man out in the beginning being singled out & worked over by both men only to showcase his superior strength taking down both men together causing Seth & Dean to form an unlikely alliance to keep Leakee down & out of the match before it eventually broke back down to being every man for himself with one man being able to execute a move on one opponent them immediately hitting another the other or avoiding one's move then hitting their own on the other or just taking out both opponents at once in what was a great match telling a good story.
""FCW"" Feb. '12

Dean Ambrose vs. William Regal - This was a year in the making after Regal dislocated Ambrose's arm a year earlier which Regal targeted right away with various stretches & twist while along with moves such as the keylock & repeatably dropping his weight on it as both men played mind games with each other as Regal kept allowing Dean to get to his feet only for him to respond ""you better take this arm home with you!"" which resulted in the intensity being heavily picked up with both men using the ringside environment to their advantage to focus & repeatably pound on a certain part of the body to the point where one man was so heavily effected by it that the trainer had to get involved to see if a participant could continue only for his response to signal his opponent to put him out of his misery in what was a great physical match based off not only the storytelling but an aftermath that resulted in the entire staff having to get involved in this situation.
As a side note, the match is edited to go to black & white instead of color towards the end due to the amount of blood.
""FCW"" July '12

NXT Championship Match: Seth Rollins vs. Jinder Mahal - This was the finals of the Gold Rush tournament to determine the first NXT Champion as Seth controlled Jinder early with wrestling & using his own momentum against him causing Jinder to resort to dirty tactics & taking advantage of the ringside environment allowing him to heavily ground Seth heavily working over his lower back to the point where Seth showed signs of it even when performing his own offense as they traded momentum with Jinder continuing to focus on Seth's weakened back while Seth resorted to his high flying offense from the top rope & springboard positions resulting in a competitive match & definitely the best Jinder Mahal performance you'll ever see on DVD.
""NXT"" Aug. '12

Roman Reigns vs. CJ Parker - This was debut of Leakee under the name ""Roman Reigns"" for where showcased dominance easily overpowering Parker & catching him in mid-air at one point while also heavily working over a body part throughout the match.
""NXT"" Oct. '12

T.L.C. Match: The Shield vs. Ryback & Team Hell No - This was the first T.L.C. match (but not the first ladder match) where you can win by pinfall & submission and you saw exactly how this match was going to go when all the teams started brawling on the floor the moment The Shield made their way to ringside. There were plenty of hard hits & falls as expected in this type of match like one man sandwitched in between a ladder with a chair striking it, a DDT on a chair, a double suplex onto a ladder, a powerbomb through a table, a double suplex from a table setup on the top turnbuckle & Kane's top rope clothesline from that same table that turned one of The Shield inside out, a spear through the barricade before being buried underneath everything in sight, Daniel Bryan doing a ""NO Lock"" to everyone in sight, a curb stomp onto an open chair, and a dangerous fall off a ladder through tables. This was definitely a highlight performance for everyone involved as Kane & Ryback were made to look like monsters, Daniel Bryan came off like a little pitbull who kept bringing the fight, and The Shield looked like a tight unit who kept using the strategy of trying to single out one person for double & triple teaming.
T.L.C. '12
[Blu-Ray Edition of Wrestling's Greatest Factions]

Dean Ambrose vs. United States Champion Kofi Kingston - Reigns & Rollins didn't accompany Ambrose to ringside making this match truly one on one as Kofi started out with his typical face paced offense of some high flying moves mixed with various kicks while Dean implied more of a grounded & slower pace with moves such as an impactful clothesline & crossface chicken wing plus showing that he's scouted Kofi at one point backing away from the Trouble In Paradise before both men hit some big moves like the S.O.S., double arm suplex, springboard crossbody, a Trouble In Paradise that knocked Dean to the outside, and one hell of a face plant. Solid match.
Extreme Rules '13

Tornado Match: Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins vs. Tag Team Champions Team Hell No - Tornado Tag rules are simply that everyone in the match is legally allowed in the ring at the same time & The Shield was represented by Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns as Dean Ambrose already wrestled earlier in the night. Bryan & Kane came out strong with Kane hitting a running DDT & Bryan holding Rollins in a surfboard setup for Kane to score a low dropkick but The Shield stuck to what kept working for them in the past using their numbers game by double teaming one individual at a time by beating them down in the corner but offensive moves such as a double suplex before Hell No kept using their teamwork such as back to back top move maneuvers & Kane taking both men over the top rope so Bryan can deliver his suicide dive. This was another solid match.
Extreme Rules '13

WWE Tag Team Champions Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns vs. The Usos - The Usos took control early relying on their fast pace double teaming offense keeping one member away from his partner not allowing The Shield to build any momentum at all before The Sheild was able to rebound by grounding their opponents slowing the pace down & using The Usos own strategy of isolating their partner & double teaming against them as both teams traded momentum pulling off their signature offensive throughout the match from The Usos high flying to The Shield's hard hitting impactful moves.
Money In The Bank Kickoff Show '13

Elimination Match: The Shield & Real Americans vs. The Usos, Rhodes Brothers, Rey Mysterio - A traditional elimination match here with four of the top established tag teams & the return of Rey Mysterio that had various highlights such as pre-match twerking (yes, you read that right), how one participant ""talked himself out of the match"", back to back giant swings, the teamwork between all the team members, and one of the most dominate single performances in Survivor Series history. This was a fun opening match.
Survivor Series '13

The Shield vs. The Wyatt Family - Both teams had the same strategy in the beginning in that they isolated one member of the group working him over in their corner with their teammates making quick tags & having no problem taking their shots in on the apron with members of each team delivering offense that we haven't seen from them previously such as Luke Harper's dropkick & suicide dive along with Seth Rollings series of aerial offense that made the commentators compare him to Spiderman before things eventually did break down in the all out brawl between all six men that went not just in & outside of the ring but throughout the crowd as well that resulted in participants in the match being taken out one by one allowing the numbers game to take effect. This turned out to be the intense fight you was expecting with Jerry Lawler describing it best saying ""what a battle"" with the crowd being hot for this with duel chants for both teams & ""This Is Awesome!"" before they touched along with this match causing one of the funniest Twitter trends in WWE history.
Elimination Chamber '14

No Holds Barred/Elimination Match: The Shield vs. Evolution - Before I get started, apparently ""Bluetista"" didn't get the memo on what to wear for this match as he stuck out like a bodybuilding smurf leading to the funniest WWE related trend I've ever seen on Twitter. This started right off the bat as a war with all six men fighting throughout the crowd & ringside area all the way to the stage before the action finally settled into the ring with each team having the same strategy of working over a member of the other team in their half of the ring either individually or through double & triple teaming with frequent tags with the action eventually breaking down once again into a huge brawl going all over the building with one man getting knocked out with what looked like a metal sheet while another body went through the spanish announce table to bodies were flying out of what seemed like nowhere including the top of the titantron along with bodies being punished with various weapons from chairs to kendo sticks. While the other matches on the card I described as physical or a brawl, this was both of those descriptions as both teams were evenly matched throughout the contest making this match & entire feud up to this point come off as an all-out war between both teams with the factor of when the eliminations happened along with who was & wasn't eliminated I didn't expect.
Payback '14

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Jack Swagger - It should be noted that Bad News Barrett was injured earlier in the week eliminating him from this match as this match was full of various highlights including Ambrose staying true to his word targeting Rollins right away fighting into the timekeepers area, the unique way Kofi caught himself falling off the ladder, ladder used as a weapon, superstars sacrificing themselves to hurt the other, one man getting taken out due to injury only to return later, one man backdropped onto a scaffold ladder, a chair coming into play, signature moves executed using the ladder, and ""there's always a Plan B."" This was one of those ladder matches that had tons of hard work & crazy spots where everyone has having their moment to shine with my opinion being Jack Swagger being the M.V.P. of the match getting without a doubt his strongest singles performance in almost a year.
Money In The Bank '14

Lumberjack Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Dean dominated early punishing & torturing Rollins while taking advantage of the lumberjacks on the outside tossing Seth to them more than once before Seth attempted to use the lumberjacks the same way only for Dean to react differently having no issues fighting back with the lumberjacks as both men traded momentum in the ring before the action went to the outside with both men fighting the lumberjacks to either get to or away from their opponent with the action spilling out throughout the crowd with the lumberjacks eventually having to physically carry to men back to the ring with the action just being unable to be contained between the two legal men in the match. J.B.L. pretty much said it best, ""this was the wildest most chaotic lumberjack match in history.""
SummerSlam '14

Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton - Reigns went after Orton right away with punches & headbutts taking the match to the outside where Orton was able to reverse the momentum in his favor slowing down the pace working him over with offense such as the garvin stomp & a superplex with both men going back & forth as Orton used the ringside environment on his advantage while Reigns kept fighting with his trademark apron dropkick & superman punch as they continued to counter each other's signature moves while executing their own in a great match.
SummerSlam '14

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Both former Shield members started trading blows against each other in the ring right away & continued throughout the crowd onto the stage area before making their way back into the ring where both men found creative ways to use a chair against each other along with other weapons such as a kendo stick as they were able to counter each other's signature moves while continuing to just beat the hell out of each other including sacrificing themselves just to hurt their opponent to the point where the only way this match stopped was that one man had to take it too far to ensure the other guy wouldn't get back up.
""RAW"" Aug. '14
[Best Of RAW & SmackDown 2014]

Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins - They were already scheduled to go at the Night Of Champions PPV later in the week but couldn't wait as Reigns was in control early tossing Seth around & beating him down in the ring & around ringside including sending him clear over the announce table at one point before Seth was able to find an opening keeping him grounded while executing his own such as the suicide dive as both men traded momentum showing how well they know each other by countering & avoided each other's signature offense as it just came down to one man being able to catch the other.
""RAW"" Sept. '14

(Blu-Ray) FCW 15 Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - This was a rematch from their first encounter with the time limit increased to 20 minutes with Seth showing that this was more personal than before by fighting before the bell & brawling around ringside including using the steps while Seth did a much more technical approach with various submission moves while adding his own twist to it such as rubbing his forearm across the face or bridging his body as they continued to go back & forth to the point where the ring just couldn't contain these two as they beat on each other until neither man had nothing left with William Regal on commentary after the match challenging not just those in FCW but on the main roster of WWE to step their game up because these two just ""raised the bar"".
""FCW"" Aug. '11

(Blu-Ray) Dean Ambrose vs. Undertaker - This was Undertaker's first match on SmackDown in 3 years but was outnumbered from the rest of the members of The Shield at ringside which caused a distraction right from the start allowing Dean to get some punches in before Taker retaliated with his series of strikes as they traded momentum with both men trading punches throughout the match with both men with each man executing offense such as the legdrop on the apron & DDT as the bigger story of this match was the aftermath that resembles the phrase ""you won the battle but lost the war.""
""SmackDown"" Apr. '13

(Blu-Ray) WWE Tag Team Champions Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins vs. Randy Orton & Daniel Bryan - The Shield used the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" as they worked over each man individually by double teaming in the corner & keeping them grounded while taunting their partner allowing them to distract the referee before Orton started to fight back suplexing one into the other in the corner while Bryan attacked both men over with dropkicks & a suicide dive that hit Orton as well while later Orton went for the RKO only to collide into Bryan & later shove him into a spear from Reigns. This tag match wasn't much past continuing the build the issues for weeks between Orton & Bryan while also still playing off the fact that The Shield wrestle as a team while their opponents wrestle as individuals.
Payback '13

(Blu-Ray) Royal Rumble Battle Royal - Various moments include two previous World Champions from another ""honorable"" company starting out, the various surprise entrants including one man making his debut from NXT, Kofi Kingston making his yearly Rumble elimination highlight reel, Zeb Colter's signs depending on your sense of humor, the Cesaro Swings, who really believed in The Shield?, a new record broken after over a decade, the crowds response to one man being excluded from the match, the reaction that couldn't be denied at the end no matter how high they tried to drown it out with theme music and as of right now (a week & a half later after the event) what looks like to be the final performance of one of the biggest stars in recent years. It was your typical Rumble match that had it's entertaining & shocking (good & bad) moments.
Royal Rumble '14

Blu-Ray extras include additional discussions about the Dean Ambrose vs. William Regal rivalry & Roman Reign's character ""Leakee.""  I already stated my positives & negatives but this was without a doubt the strongest faction in the past few years in the WWE with each man moving on to become a superstar in their own right currently in WWE with the matches from their FCW developmental territory being lost gems or maybe even go as far as a ""lost classics"" so it's set I would definitely recommend.",1424044800,13,23189,4.66601419133839

6860363,5,B00Q7SBAVW,"The Destruction of the Shield was awesome & is a must own to any WWE fan of the Shield. Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose & Roman Reigns are the real deal & are future WWE World Heavyweight Champions in the future.",1427932800,,207,4.2
6860364,3,B00Q7SBAVW,"I was expecting WAY more for one of the greatest factions in the history of WWE. First off, I didn't like how they tried to basically paint Reigns as the ""god send' to the WWE and the other two just happened to be there. (This is solely based on the interview and documentary part). It seemed that they were in character the whole time and they didn't really connect, which I understand but if it's supposed to be on the men behind the shield, I'd want to know more about them specifically. I also did not like how short it was. There were a lot of topics that could've been expanded on but they were quickly mentioned and then off to the next topic. It didn't really feel like a documentary, but maybe a 30 minute history of The Shield. Again, it could've been a lot better but it wasn't incredibly terrible. Also, I have a problem with Reigns in the front on the DVD cover. But maybe that's just me.",1426636800,3,901,4.2748538011695905

6860366,3,B00Q7SBAVW,"I was really expecting more than this, something along the lines of the Sting collection. The Shield only fought EVERYONE. I wanted to actually see full matches. Didn't get a one, just interviews. Also, it ended too early, I really wanted them to cover the Hell in a Cell match that shafted Dean Ambrose so badly, explain some of the reasoning behind that.",1425686400,,356,4.666666666666667
6860367,5,B00Q7SBAVW,The destruction of the shield tells the story about the hounds of justice and how they split up. But watch how Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns went to stardom when they separated and Plus theres matches from when they just started their career. Plus the blu ray has bonus features on it so if your a fan of the hounds justice get this set so believe in the shield.,1425081600,,362,4.260869565217392

I will update after I watch it. Lol",1424995200,,166,3.742857142857143

8690804,4,B00Q7SBAVW,This is a great compilation DVD.  Lots of different matches that you won't necessarily see anywhere else.  As well as all of the great matches they had once they formed The Shield and made it to the WWE.  The only thing that could have made it better was to include some of the promos they did and showcase some of the buildup to their rivalries.  But other than that I absolutely love all the matches included.  The Blue Ray is definitely the way to go with this one - the extra matches included are worth it!  They included a bunch from their time in FCW and didn't just highlight their time on the main roster.  The Shield is one of the best factions in WWE history and this is a great showcase of all their talents.,1445472000,,719,4.242647058823529
8690805,5,B00Q7SBAVW,A great in-depth look at the Shield. Great backstage footage.,1442188800,,61,5.2
8690806,5,B00Q7SBAVW,I was not a fan of these guys at first but as I kept watching them in the WWE I was slowly changing my mind each night watching them on TV it was well worth the change of tune for me. So glad I was able to get this DVD as I don't have Blu-ray but I enjoyed learning about each one of them its clear to see why Seth is the Big Diva he is today...LOL....but well deserved. I wish they would have added more to this DVD but I hope this give people a little more insight as to how Great Each Man will be and How they are the Future of WWE.....BELIEVE THAT!!!!,1441584000,,555,3.793103448275862
8690807,5,B00Q7SBAVW,"This is a surprisingly entertaining and informative documentary on the wrestlers Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns. I'm a fan of Seth Rollins since he became the WWE World Heavyweight Champion and recently United States Champion at Summer Slam. I wanted to know more about his genus and this was a good starting point (I don;t recommend the internet which strangely brings up a lot of slash fiction from Tumblr, as a means to investigate these three pro-wrestlers. It's a well-produced piece with highlights from a number of matches and gives great background on the three characters in the current iteration of the WWE Universe. Plus if you're a Rollins fan there is one of his workouts which is three minutes that in HD justifies the price of the download - no lie! Oh, and I'm not even a WWE fan! So this has appeal to just about anyone!",1441411200,,850,4.673333333333333
