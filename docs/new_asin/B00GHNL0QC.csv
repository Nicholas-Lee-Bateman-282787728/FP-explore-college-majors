6076279,5,B00GHNL0QC,"This is truly a fantastic documentary. You really get a sense of the man, of who he really is. It was incredible to see video footage of Pope Francis as bishop and archbishop. This is really the first time in history where we've had an extensive video record of a Pope before his election. And this documentary does a beautiful job of combining those primary source materials with interviews from his closest companions and leading Catholic commentators, to tell the full story of Pope Francis' life and mission.

6076282,5,B00GHNL0QC,"I can't wait to watch it again. Veered into the political sometimes but not too much. I love how he refused to be politicized and just kept repeating, ""think of the poor."" Very well done film. His message is so simple and so Christ-like. But he sounds like a good adminstrator as well so he has the perfect mix of positive qualities. A wonderful choice. How lucky we are to live in his time.",1467936000,,391,4.297297297297297

6076305,5,B00GHNL0QC,This is a beautiful and moving story about Pope Francis before he became Pope. I first viewed this with a group of friends and many were moved to tears. After seeing his simple love for the poor we decided to get our families together and make dinner for 200 local homeless people. I bought this so my family could see the movie. The makers of the movie interview people rarely interviewed (the poor and homeless) and common people who met Pope Francis on the subway. I learned that not only did Pope Francis not own a car he also did not use taxis because he wanted to be with the people. He knew the people of the slums because he walked their streets and visited with them. If someone asked for help he knew who in the area could help them because he had a personal relationship with the people. There is so much more in the movie. You will have a greater respect for Pope Francis after viewing  this movie and a better understanding of what it means to love the poor.,1428796800,,971,4.306010928961749

6076328,5,B00GHNL0QC,"Pope Francis is often spoken of as a new kind of leader for the Catholic Church. This book reveals his true giftedness to the world. His focus is not truly new. It is the focus the church was given by the best of the past. Pope John the 23rd and Pope John Paul II both focused on the same. ""The church has needed to open the windows and let the Holy Spirit in.""  This Pope certainly has and does listen to the Holy Spirit and is encouraging others to do so.",1394841600,,457,4.021978021978022

I DISAGREE WITH THOSE COMMENTS, TO PROPERLY UNDERSTAND OUR HOLY FATHER ONE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONDITIONS OF THE TIMES IN WHICH HE GREW UP AND CONTINUED TO LIVE AS CARDINAL.  ONLY THEN CAN WE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY HE MADE THE DECISIONS HE DID AND WHY HE DEVELOPED THE PHILOSOPHIES HE BROUGHT TO HIS MINISTRY AS CARDINAL AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE PAPACY.  I THINK THAT IT WAS VERY WELL DONE AND PRESNENTS AN ACCURATE STORY AS TO WHO POPE FRANCIS IS AND HOW HE THINKS THE CHURCH SHOULD BE",1392508800,,651,4.311475409836065

Viewers can gain a deeper understanding of this new Pope and be inspired by his life style.

However, the printed comments at the bottom of the video are unfortunaely not always easy to read.",1390003200,,450,4.894736842105263
6076357,5,B00GHNL0QC,"This glossy 51-minute documentary on the life of Pope Francis, produced by the Knights of Columbus, gives a great overview of who the first Jesuit and (South) American pope really is. I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about the passions, personality, and cultural background of Pope Francis. It is talkier and more interview-driven than other Pope Francis documentary DVDs sold here on Amazon, but it also does a better job of highlighting his care for the poor than any other video. It is the best and most professionally done Pope Francis documentary.

The video has good location footage in Argentina. There are no extras on this Janson Media disc, but simply a language choice (English or Spanish) and chapter menu. Some interviewees are Americans and English speakers, but most are Italian and Spanish speakers over-dubbed in English. The pope's words alone are subtitled in English, so we can hear his natural voice.

The content of the material is quite insightful at times. The interview footage is well chosen, with a strong preference for Argentinians -- from politicians to ordinary poor folk -- rather than talking heads or media analysts. A disproportionately large number of the interviews feature native Argentinians who knew ""Father Jorge"" before he was pope, lending a real poignancy to their recollections, and the film is quite good when it lets them share their love of the man's ordinary habits (one woman talks about riding the subway with him) in simple words.

Other interviews, kept tactfully brief, are done with American Catholic observers like Supreme Knight Carl Anderson and Bergoglio's friend Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston. Rather than plunging the program into an analysis by American talking heads, these interviews have a positive effect, lending just enough of an English-language flavor to the program to prevent it from feeling entirely like a Spanish production translated for U.S. viewers. The English-language interviews and narration do give this video a leg up over ""Who Is Pope Francis?"", another documentary being sold through Ignatius Press in the United States that features so-so English dubbing with occasional mispronunciations. The stock footage is also pretty good, including some concluding video material from World Youth Day in Rio (July 2013) not available on earlier Francis biopics.

In the final analysis, my favorite documentary on the new pope is now this one, as it's a bit more substantive than the earlier ""Who Is Pope Francis?"" (see my earlier review of that product) from Spain-based Goya Productions. This video gives you a deeper picture of the man that is concise, broad and fast-moving. ""Francis: The Pope From the New World"" features superior interview material. Whereas the Goya Productions video features interviews primarily with Spain-based commentators and a few Jesuits from Argentina, the Knights of Columbus video features truly heartfelt insights from people who know Francis intimately as friends. While it is talky, this new video is at its best when it simply lets people who know Francis intimately talk about why they love him, and the fact that these people are ""real"" human beings (poor, average, faithful South Americans) is ultimately the biggest point in this video's favor.",1389744000,5,3277,5.236190476190476
6076358,5,B00GHNL0QC,"I really like everything I have read and heard about this man. I was quite curious to learn more about him.

6076359,5,B00GHNL0QC,"The knights of Columbus has sponsored this documentary and I am a member of the Knights. I wanted a copy of the DVD, as well as, our Pastor of our Church. I ordered the DVD and was most impressed with the originality and authenticity of the material presented. The many people who spoke about the Pope in his own country of Argentina impressed me. Because of the worldwide interest in this special Pope, many people will be taking advantage of ordering this DVD to show to show in Parish groups and organizations within the Church. I consider the DVD a documentary of great instructional value as well as being inspiring and informative. I would highly recommend this DVD to all members of the Knights of Columbus throughout the world, as well as, an informative tool for students both in schools and universities. I also think many seminaries in the world will be showing this DVD to its future priests as a guide as to what a Servant of God should be to their parishioners. All in all, a big thank you to the Knights of Columbus for sponsoring this most extraordinary documentary of Pope Francis. John Roberts - Knights of Columbus.",1389312000,7,1134,4.646766169154229

6076363,5,B00GHNL0QC,"We chose it because it portrays the man, the disciples of Christ.  Shows that he is still who he always was.  We have shared it with our son and his wife, who with some of their friends, have a picture in their minds of a pope who will ""bend with the times"" and will see from this that Papa Francis is a man of God, and who knows that God's truths never change.",1387756800,,361,3.9315068493150687

6076366,5,B00GHNL0QC,"The only documentary of its kind to interview the people who knew him best in Argentina. The access the film makers were able to get to those who knew Pope Francis so well for so long makes this a must see movie. It's eye opening, riveting, and very smooth, which is a rarity among documentaries. Long before he was TIME's person of the year,"" he was Argentina's man for all seasons. I have already watched it three times and got more out of it every time.",1387152000,12,456,4.313953488372093

6076369,5,B00GHNL0QC,"This documentary shows the real Pope Francis!

After the way he's been portrayed in the media over the past few months, I wasn't sure what to think of Francis. I couldn't form a clear idea of who this new pope really was because the news was only giving me sound bites! So when I saw this documentary advertised on TV, I tuned in.

This documentary is great! It has lots of interviews from people who knew Francis at all parts of his life: childhood friends, priests, politicians, and parishioners. You learn about so many endearing stories, like how Bergoglio saved a Jesuit priest from execution during the Argentine civil war, how he frequently visited residents of the Buenos Aires slums, how he confronted Argentine politicians in his homilies, and even how he's had a lifelong love of the San Lorenzo soccer team!

If you want to know who Pope Francis is and where he comes from, this is the best resource out there.",1385078400,37,922,4.644171779141105
