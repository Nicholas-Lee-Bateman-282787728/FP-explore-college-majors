8510199,1,B000UUFTG0,"Ok, I gave this one star because you have to. But this is the worst ""DVD"" I have ever seen. I have done better videos with my digital camera and put it to my own bad music that at least does not skip. All they did was have one person sit in one spot and tape Cherokee's go bouncing past. I was actually thinking of getting into jeepspeed until I saw this ""video"" and was completly turned away. Please please please do not buy this. I already called Amazon to complain and return this and was told sorry, no refunds, so I am doing you a favor in telling you to NEVER BUY THIS!",1219795200,,575,4.052631578947368
