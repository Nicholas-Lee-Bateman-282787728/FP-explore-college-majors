7901119,3,8474029236,"""Sweet~Sweet Spirit"" was recorded in the Gaither Studio in Alexandria, Indiana in 1999. Each of the Homecoming concerts has a unique difference, yet with a familiar warm spirit that emanates love, affirmation, and inspiration which transforms ""spectator entertainment"" into ""participatory active worship.""

The musical selections on this production relied heavily on the volume, beat, and sheer numbers of the singers. I was deeply moved by a few of the numbers. I especially enjoyed ""There is a River"" featuring Gerald Wolfe and ""Lead me Gently Home"" featuring Glen Allred. I enjoyed The Trio made up of Anthony Burger, Ivan Parker, and Kirk Talley singing ""Glory Road.""

Dan Miller's testimony was especially challenging and uplifting. I enjoyed his arrangement of ""Joy Comes in the Morning."" Other featured artists include: Lillie Knauls, Buddy Greene, Guy Penrod, David Phelps, Joy Gardner, Jesse Dixon, and many others.

Overall I missed the spontaneity, excitement, and quality which usually make up a Homecoming Friends production",1313539200,,1037,5.550632911392405
