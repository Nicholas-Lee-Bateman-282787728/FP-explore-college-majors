188379,5,157132528X,"My 19 month old son actually sits still while watching this Barney DVD! A great collection of songs, as well as a good diversity of kids. An added bonus for the parents: Check out Barney singing in Spanish...it's too funny!",978998400,7,223,4.6
188390,5,157132528X,"With Barney Songs haunting me I would give it a 2 star rating.  But seeing my daughters smile, and her dancing and singing makes Barney a 5 star package all the way.",1424217600,,165,4.15625
188391,5,157132528X,"Got this DVD for grandson, he loves it, what more can I say",1424131200,,59,3.6153846153846154
188392,4,157132528X,"This video is just another episode, it is NOT an episode that focuses on extra songs.  It does however have another option for another episode.  So it's kinda like getting 2 videos in 1 which is nice.",1402876800,,200,4.378378378378378
188393,5,157132528X,My two year old loves Barney.  The more singing and dancing the better.  This is perfect to keep in the car for  when she is tired of being in the carseat.,1396915200,,155,3.935483870967742
188394,5,157132528X,My grandchildren love this dvd. They like the different voices and they know the kid's names. And all of the songs!,1395878400,,115,4.523809523809524
188395,5,157132528X,"Great video.  My daughter loves it and I don't mind watching it with her.  The songs are very good.  I hate to say it, but I find myself singing Barney songs now after watching the videos with my daughter.  This is one of my daughters favorite Barney videos.",1376524800,,258,4.3125
188396,4,157132528X,"My baby just love watching this even though she doesn't have a clue to what's its about.
It's a must seen.",1357516800,,106,4.095238095238095
188397,5,157132528X,i bought this product along with Barney's imagination island and i absolutely love them both!! so glad i made the choice to buy them! my daughter loves them both and it reminds me of when my nieces and nephews were small!,1340323200,,221,4.414634146341464
188398,5,157132528X,"This is a great DVD for the little ones - it has a lot of good features on the DVD so you're not stuck watching the same video over and over again. My son is almost 2 and absolutely loves ""Narny"" videos. This is the second one we've purchased that he adores. It's almost exclusively music, which is what holds his attention the best. I highly recommend this video if your little one is into Barney!",1278115200,,398,4.25
188399,4,157132528X,"i took this for my niece. i liked it, hope she will like it too....",1221782400,,67,3.533333333333333
188410,4,157132528X,"My twenty month old daughter really enjoys watching this.  There are actually two videos on this dvd and all the songs are good ones.  It has a lot of features compared to more recent dvds. I especially like the jukebox feature that allows me to select one or a few songs to play at a time.  There are songs about washing hands, brushing teeth, and eating healthy snack as well as toddler favorites about animals and dancing and clapping hands.  Yes, it's Barney, but my daughter really connects with the singing and dancing.  Just be careful, you'll end up with these songs in your head!",1214265600,,588,4.561904761904762
188411,5,157132528X,As long as my baby enjoys it then that's all that matters. Personally I don't care for it.,1214006400,,90,4.055555555555555
188412,5,157132528X,My daughter just loves Barney and this video is one of our favorites to date.  Would definately recommend to any Barney fan.,1200528000,,124,4.636363636363637
188413,1,157132528X,This dvd has no more songs than a regular episode of Barney. I purchased it thinking it was a dvd of songs.  Hence the title states!!!  But it is not.  If you want to pay that much for a single episode of barney then go for it!!!  Very disapointed:-(,1174348800,2,250,4.040816326530612
188414,4,157132528X,"My three year-old daughter likes it a lot and has been watching it once and again! Still, (as an adult children's song lover) I personally liked some other ""Barney Songs"" better.",1174003200,,178,4.774193548387097
188415,4,157132528X,"My son loves More Barney Songs.  It is fun to interact with him as we sing the songs and do all the motions.  The DVD has some great extras including a song juke box that we play most of the time.  It features a bunch of fun songs and includes the words.  A definate plus for this Mom to learn and teach.  It is the ""old"" Barney voice but my son doesn't seem to mind.",1120867200,4,367,3.84
188416,5,157132528X,"I had never actually watched Barney before this was given to my 18 month old son.  He loves watching videos and he loves this one the best. He will watch this video straight through, sometimes sitting mesmerized in front of the TV.  I don't put this on unless we have time to watch it to the end because he gets upset if I turn it off.  This is great when I'm trying to get dinner on the table.  Sometimes I worry though that he is a little bit too captivated by watching this video.  What is it about Barney that is so appealing?  I only let him watch it every few days but it is a winner every time.  I like this video because the characters are warm and friendly and teach good values while having lots of fun and singing and dancing.  The songs are very catchy and I know the words to them all now.  Overall, a very good video.",1090281600,12,831,4.080246913580247
188417,5,157132528X,"I owned 3 Barney's DVDs. My one year and three months old girl likes this title the most.  We've been playing this DVD at least once each day since she was one.  It is now a bedtime must.  She have to go through all the songs through the 'Video-jukebox' before too tired to sleep. I don't have all Barney's discs, so not in a position to say it is the best.  But I am sure that this should be one of your collection.",1076284800,4,416,3.9759036144578315
188418,5,157132528X,My 19-month-old son loves this DVD.  We rented it from Blockbuster and when we had to take it back he was very disappointed.  I bought it the same day.,1075334400,3,151,4.172413793103448
188419,5,157132528X,"She will stand in front of the TV whenever this comes on and stare it for the entire length of the tape.  If I need to do the dishes or throw in a quick load of laundry I know that my daughter will be entertained for a few minutes.
She sways with the music and smiles from ear to ear!",1051056000,,284,3.7333333333333334

7797403,5,157132528X,"I purchased this DVD for my son. This is his third More Barney Songs DVD because he loves it so much!!!  The price was great so I didn't hesitate when he told me that his last one was scratched.  Barney is a classic and if your little one loves Barney songs, they will love this DVD.  I highly recommend this DVD.  You and your kiddo will not be disappointed:).",1458691200,,361,4.188405797101449
