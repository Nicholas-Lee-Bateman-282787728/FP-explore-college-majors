8213335,5,B000UHT4VY,"this is a great DVD comparing the 2004  gt automatic,  Mach 1  manual and cobra convertible Shows them on a race track, drag strip ( exterior and in car views) Also shows engine bay, interior, exterior.  If you are a fan of the new edge mustang , you will like this. Was shot in 04 when these were new cars , the film quality is pretty good for DVD.  It basically is a DVD version of a magazine car comparo review.",1465603200,,414,4.061728395061729
