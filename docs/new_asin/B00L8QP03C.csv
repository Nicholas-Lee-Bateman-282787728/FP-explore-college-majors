6475152,5,B00L8QP03C,"I came looking for They Live.  It has one of the best fight scenes of all time.  I was thrilled to find it packaged with the other 3 movies.  The Thing is awesome, it does have questionable special effects, but it an outstanding movie on its own.  Virus is another great movie.  I had forgotten all about it.  Then the classic Village of the Damned.  Each of these is worth the price of the DVD, but getting them packaged for one low price is fantastic.",1433289600,24,453,4.258823529411765

I read a few people posting about image/film quality issues. I saw none when watching on a 1080p screen.

My main objective was to have ""They Live "" & ""The Thing"" on D.V.D. the other 2 movies were a pleasant bonus.  My player had no problems playing the compressed movies & both the audio & picture quality was great!!!  I saw a interview with Roddy Piper on ""Info-Wars"" & right before his ""Heart Attack"" & he was tweeting & telling his fans that the movie ""They Live"" was closer to a documentary than a science fiction movie. Not so much that those in control were aliens but were ""Aliens"" to the true human condition, very interesting interview.

6475476,5,B00L8QP03C,"This pack is a great value.  You get four A-grade movies for five bucks, how can you go wrong?
As for the quality, yes all the movies are on one single sided disc, but the transfers are pretty good, we watched on a 46"" screen with no real dip in quality.  But that can maybe be attributed to the Blu-ray player we played the disc with and it's up convert to higher resolution function.
It's worth the five bucks alone just for They Live and The Thing, and the other two aren't so bad either.  This is a great way to watch these movies if you haven't seen them before and aren't sure you'll like them, you won't spend a small fortune springing for the Blu-rays for each movie.  Worst case you can upgrade later.  Though you probably will like them enough to upgrade.
Even if you have three out of the four and just want this for one of them, it's five bucks, what's it really going to cost you?",1446336000,2,893,4.1988304093567255
