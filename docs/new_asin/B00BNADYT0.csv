5658178,5,B00BNADYT0,"I believe the film mentioned that for the first time that a camera crew had been allowed to filmed in that part in Russia. I really enjoyed seeing so much area of land that has probably remain virtually as it was when God created it, as well as all the footage of animals who are native only in that part of the planet. The film makers did an excellent job, there were really no dull parts that I can remember, and for the price you get 3 and1/2 hours of documentary. Would highly recommend.",1375056000,3,491,4.23404255319149
5658179,2,B00BNADYT0,"WARNING!!!!  This is a shorter version of ""Animal Planet's Wild Russia"", which I purchased 2 years ago.  ""The Majestic Wild"" is 38 minutes shorter than ""Wild Russia"".  ""The Majestic Wild"" is basically the same with less content.

If you have not seen ""Wild Russia"", this is a must as ""Wild Russia"" is beautiful and have watched it several times. But we cannot now find ""Wild Russia"" available at Amazon.com or elsewhere.

If I had not already seen this on ""Wild Russia"", I would have given ""The Majestic Wild"" a 5 (plus) rating.",1373587200,16,528,4.695652173913044

8571582,4,B00BNADYT0,"This is a wonderful documentary! I bought this because I loved Wild Russia ... Just an FYI, this is Wild Russia but it is missing one segment of the complete series. It is about one hour short of the full series, so that is my only complaint...just wish it was complete. Lovely footage! Beautiful!",1453507200,4,297,4.518518518518518

8571584,5,B00BNADYT0,"Absolutely thrilled with this DVD. I know other reviewers have mentioned it is an abridged version but that did not matter to me. The footage is beautiful, the narration is not Attenborough but still very pleasing and interesting. Love that it shows these unusual areas, the team did a great job! I've watched all 5 episodes twice since I bought it a week ago! The only small aspect I didn't like is the cheesy Gaiam ad at the start of the DVD that we are forced to watch.
If anyone can direct me to the unabridged version, please let me know where to find it. Thanks!",1445558400,4,568,4.367924528301887

Even if you got money it is not possible for us to go there to see such beautiful scenery and animals especially in such country like Russia. Thanks for delivery of such good documentary show.,1392940800,2,245,4.72093023255814
