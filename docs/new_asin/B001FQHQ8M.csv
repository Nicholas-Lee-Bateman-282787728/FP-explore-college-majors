8302408,1,B001FQHQ8M,This is a great documentary but after two copies from Amazon neither worked on multiple DVD players and a bluray/dvd combo player. I also tried it on my computer. Disappointed it didn't work.,1404864000,,191,4.818181818181818
8302409,3,B001FQHQ8M,"Spectacular climbing up and down a ""tepui"" table mountain in South America.  They overly hype the scientific value of their adventure.  So get it for the thrills.  Characters speak in Slovakian but narrator speaks in English.  Standard definition resolution; didn't look very good on our HDTV.",1387670400,,293,5.304347826086956
8302410,5,B001FQHQ8M,"What these foks accomplished, let alone were able to document, is nothing short of amazing!  Anyone who loves the remotest of the Venezuelan jungles should watch this.  Having lived in Venezuela myself for 32 years, I still find it hard to believe.  The team adopted the style of not leaving a trace behind them.  As to the Indigenous Myth about the Auyantepui, they had this to say:  ""At the end of our journey I finally found the footprints of the bad demon of the Canaima of whom whole generations of Pemones were afraid.  If you're looking for him there on the table mountain but he lives in an entirely different place.  He lives in each of us.""  Highly recommended.",1342742400,,671,4.579831932773109
8302411,5,B001FQHQ8M,"This was a very well done documentary by a small group of world-experienced climbers who had to deceive the natives to accomplish the project. If you look at some of the rocks on top, you can see similar geological formations to those where tectonic plates have shifted and jutted up large portions of rock. The VARIETY of environments is pretty astounding, especially the chasm where nature is so effective at absorbing the water that it all but disappears. The ending was very well tied off. Highly suggested for anyone to see, especially if you find our world interesting in any way.",1334966400,,586,4.811881188118812
