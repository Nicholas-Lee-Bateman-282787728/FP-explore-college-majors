8339896,5,B001SJNOPK,I recorded this movie from TCM  and was going to remove it from my list because it sounded old and uninteresting and had captions in another language but managed to start it my mistake and continued watching it!  It was so impressive and a movie that should be re released!  It remains in my thoughts and I plan to save it to rewatch again!  Wish I could get a copy of it but cant afford that much money!  The whole message of the movie is powerful and the man it portrays is a man who truly practices what Jesus did!  It was like watching a man who gave of himself totally to his fellow man without wanting nothing for himself and yet he did get his reward in love and devotion from the people he gave himself to!  I do this movie gets more accolades in our time!  We could use the lesson it teaches today!!,1515801600,,808,4.134615384615385

8339899,5,B001SJNOPK,"My father was a small town Doctor from 1938 to 1990. He made house calls delivered babies at home. He ended up in Laredo by a fluke and togethwr with my mom a R.N. made a life together raising a family This is a well made movie and very realistic about athe demands upon a physician's life.  Even in the ""New Era ""of Modern medicine. This m ovie is an astoundingly accurate depiction of the small town doctor that literally did every conceivable medical procedure imaginable for the times. This movie is a tribute to the ""old school"" physicians ...and to my beloved father and the one remaining practitioner of that Era extant who still practices.
 Thank goodness a copy was found and preserved in the Netherlands.",1429660800,2,714,4.6141732283464565
8339900,5,B001SJNOPK,"Not many today watch A MAN TO REMEMBER or even have heard of it and that is a loss not only for fans of film but also for humanity.  The topic is one that Hollywood currently finds unfashionable or politically incorrect. Screen writer Dalton Trumbo has created a caring and trusted small town doctor (Edward Ellis) who faithfully serves the ungrateful and nitpicking residents of that town. He cares little for money. His concern is for those who have little of that so he accepts alternate means of payment. In one memorable scene he takes a pig as payment for medical services rendered and then tries to use that pig as legal tender in a store. Ellis portrays this doctor as an infinitely wise predecessor of all future film physicians from Dr. Kildare to Marcus Welby.  If he gets angry at the penny pinching bureaucrats who seek to evade his commonsense approaches to the myriad of problems that lie in his path, he shows more crusty wisdom than misdirected spleen. He takes in an abandoned child left literally at his doorstep and raises her as his own flesh and blood.  This child grows up to be a loving daughter (Anne Shirley who made a career of playing the sweet daughter) who helps him cope with those foolish and greedy small town minds that come straight out of Sinclair Lewis' MAIN STREET.

Much of the film is divided into chapter-like markers of written medical receipts, which collectively contour the good doctor's benign outlook on his many decades as a small town doctor.  There is also an inexplicable translation printed on the bottom of the screen which looks like Dutch.  A MAN TO REMEMBER was filmed quickly, quietly, and cheaply and was released with little fanfare. Still it has stood the test of time to emerge as an indelible mythological imprint of what we would like to think is what motivates future doctors to study medicine. By the closing credits, the man to remember has become a film to remember.",1427673600,4,1933,4.704142011834319
8339901,5,B001SJNOPK,"In both real life and in movies it is rare to find individuals who display unyielding integrity--those exceptional men and women who consciously choose to create purposeful lives and uphold their virtues as so many others betray their values for popularity or quick money. Doctor John Abbott, the hero of this story, is a genuine treasure who lives an honorable and fulfilling life despite resistance and ridicule from the town politicians. By living virtuously he creates a meaningful life and makes himself a man to remember.

The movie opens with a parade scene as a crowd of townspeople honor Doctor Abbott after his passing, circa 1920. Inside a nearby office building, a small group of pompous local bureaucrats gather in a board room with Abbott's lawyer, eager to receive a pittance from his estate. A small money box contains a record of services rendered and debts owed to Abbott. The character of Doctor Abbott and the significant impact he had on his town are thus revealed through a sequence of flashbacks showing the events surrounding each letter. Interestingly, I have read that this little-known movie was one of the first to use the flashback technique which subsequently became quite popular.

That Doctor Abbott has a central purpose in life is clear in every moment. His competence in practicing medicine is impeccable; his dedication to expanding his knowledge and skill is continuous; his desire for his son to receive the best education is admirable; his care for his patients and the town is immense. We see Doctor Abbott treating poor patients and accepting potatoes and pigs (or, sometimes, a slap in the face) as payment... and we see him treating the crooked politicians who condescend and mock his career. We see him saving money to proudly send his son to the best medical school in Paris... and we see his son betray him to work for a flashy doctor across town. We see his tireless effort to convince the council to build a hospital... we see them dismiss and ridicule his passion... we see them and their ostentatious wives take credit and glory when the hospital is finally built... and we see the scoundrels passive-aggressively set up a ridiculous rule that prevents Abbott from working in the new hospital. We see Abbott plead to the council to cancel the circus due to an outbreak of infantile paralysis (polio)... we see them strip him of his medical license because they do not want their ""reputation"" with the circus advertisers to be compromised... we see him pay with his own money to print fliers warning families not to attend the circus... we see him single-handedly  vaccinate every child in town against polio... and we see that Westport ends up being the only town in the region without a crippling polio outbreak. Parts of the story are devastating but Abbott is not broken by the disappointments; he continues to live purposefully and meaningfully.

A few other reviewers have described Doctor Abbott's character as selfless and self-sacrificing, but I believe this is a grave mistake. Notice that Doctor Abbott is the one character who holds him-SELF as sacred. He is the one character who does not allow social pressure to influence his independent judgment of the facts. He is the one character who values his integrity more than he desires second-handed admiration and popularity. This is the hallmark of a truly self-honoring, heroic man.

The lead actor, Edward Ellis, does a marvelous job of showing the mannerisms of a man of substance. He moves quickly, with adept mannerisms and a bright, enlivened expression. Similarly, the actors who play the bureaucrats do a hilariously good job of representing resentful pencil-pushers, their expressions alternating between derisive smirks and suspicious, guilty glances.

This movie was considered a B-grade film that was made in only 15 days. There are no action scenes or flashy special effects--just a captivating story about the kind of man all people should want to be. The only surviving copy has Danish captions, but I found the story to be so engaging that I barely noticed the captions on the screen. As of December 2013 the DVD from Amazon is on the pricey side due to this movie's rarity, but a more affordable copy is available from TCM. (Still, this movie is definitely worth the Amazon price!)

A Man to Remember is a must-see for anyone who longs to see a person acting on the courage of his convictions, or for anyone who too often feels lonely and alienated in a world of disappointing second-handers who betray the hero in their soul. In Doctor Abbott we find a gentle hero acting with rationality, honesty, independence, integrity, justice, pride, and productiveness. This movie will provide spiritual fuel and serve as reinforcement that, should you choose to live well and embody what it means to be a quality human, then a happy, meaningful life is your earned reward.",1388361600,6,4892,4.951278928136419
8339902,1,B001SJNOPK,"I received this product and put it in the dvd player...after 11 minutes...it stopped playing.  I tried this on multiple machines and wouldn't play.  I sent it back to the WORST company I've ever delt with.  They said it worked fine...(which it obviously didn't) and sent it back to me and would not refund anything.  Horrible people and hope that AMAZON stops doing business with them.

thanks!

8339903,2,B001SJNOPK,"""A Man to Remember"" (1938) is a remake of ""One Man's Journey"" (1933). It was based on a novel ""The Failure"" and tells the story of a country doctor's life at the start of the 20th Century.

The film stars Anne Shirley, Edward Ellis, and Lee Bowman.

Anne Shirley (1918-1993) began her career in the silent era and was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Stella Dallas"" (1937) - the same year she married actor John Payne. Among her more notable films were ""Anne of the Green Gables"" (1934), ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" (1941), and ""Murder, My Sweet"" (1944). Shirley plays the adopted daughter of the country doctor.

Edward Ellis (1870-1952) is best known for his work in films like ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932), ""Thin Man"" (1934), and ""Fury"" (1936). He plays Doc Abbott.

Lee Bowman (1914-79) is best known from his TV series ""The Adventures of Ellery Queen"" (1951-2). He plays the son.

The film is directed by Garson Kanin (1912-99). Kanin was nominated for an Oscar for writing 3 times (""Pat and Mike"", ""Adam's Rib"", ""A Double Life""), in each case with his long time wife Ruth Gordon. He was known primarily as a writer, but directed 18 films including ""The Great Man Votes"" (1939). This was his first outing as a director and the pace is slow and absent the more sophisticated material we come to expect from Kanin.

Dalton Trumbo (1905-76) is credited with the screenplay, but it's basically a copy of the 1933 film with a few variations that I don't think were well advised (e.g., he eliminates the position of the housekeeper and introduces a sub plot about building a hospital).  One change he made that did work well - Trumbo tells the tale in flashbacks. 3 years later Orson Welles would use this to better effect in ""Citizen Kane"".

Trumbo is best remembered  for his blacklisting during the McCarty era. He won the Oscar twice (""The Brave One"", ""Roman Holiday"") and was nominated a third time (""Kitty Foyle""). He won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes for ""Johnny Got His Gun"" (1971). He wrote ""Spartacus"" under an assumed name, and when Kirk Douglas insisted that his real name be used, this broke the black list.

The NY Times praised the film as ""a distinguished and unusual film"" and said ""Ellis's portrayal is splendid"". It may be, but the original film and the quality of the acting is far superior. If you have time for only one film about a country doctor in the start of the 20th Century, watch ""One Man's Journey.""

PS - I gave this film a 2 rating largely because I prefer the original and see what could be done with the material. I guess if you didn't see the original you might give it a higher rating.",1303344000,,2646,4.53781512605042
8339904,5,B001SJNOPK,"I happened upon ""A Man to Remember"" while perusing Thanksgiving Day ads for Black Friday. TCM was broadcasting it and, initially, it caught my interest right after the opening credits rolled. I was hooked. It is that kind of movie. Unpretentious, humble, but packs a whallop. The story of a small town general practitioner (doctor) whose incredible gift of unselfish devotion to medicine, and the healing of those entrusted to his care;  his ideals, character and integrity, are the hallmarks of this incredible story. This picture was one of the first to use the flashback in telling his story. From a background article found on TCM, Orson Welles used this device in Citizen Kane after viewing A Man To Remember. This movie screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo (yep the same) and directed by Garson Kanin. This film has a fascinating history. Read more on the TCM website. Suffice to say, it is warm, humane, and a rare priviledge to view this wonderful movie. Don't miss it.",1290729600,6,980,4.868263473053892
8339905,5,B001SJNOPK,"There are many stories within this movie that may move you to some interesting emotions. I believe it is well written and much worthy of a purchase. There have been similar plots before and after but for me this one has the best story. This is a far different apraoch to health care that what we are seeing today in the 21st century. You will not see major big time actors but they pull it off extremely well.
This kind of movie will touch some in different ways but I can't imagine most not enjoying this movie.",1266364800,6,512,4.288659793814433
