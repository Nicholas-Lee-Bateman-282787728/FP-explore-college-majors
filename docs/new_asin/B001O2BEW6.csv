8328893,5,B001O2BEW6,"Unforgiven is a British movie / mini series divided into more than one episode following a character named Ruth who is paroled 15 years after being imprisoned for murdering two policemen. It follows her as she faces trying to rebuild her life.  This also follows the reactions of the sons of one of the officers she was imprisoned for killing as they seek revenge upon her.

Although I can not see an American getting out of prison 15 years after two officers were killed, that may be plausible in England.  Regardless, this is a great story with exceptional writing by Sally Wainwright and great acting by the cast.  If you like this story check out Happy Valley ( a TV series with 2 seasons so far) also written by Sally Wainwright.",1466380800,3,734,4.580152671755725

Unforgiven is a mainstream psychological drama with crime elements.  Written by the superb screenwriter, Sally Wainwright, it includes several top-line British character actors.  Those include Siobhan Finneran from Downton Abbey, here playing a sympathetic lawyer rather than a scheming housemaid.  The protagonist, Ruth Slater, is played by Suranne Jones.  Peter Davison (one of the former Dr. Whos) appears as Siobhan Finnerans husband.

Ruth Slater has just been released from a 15-year prison term for killing two police officers.  Ruth (then a teenager) was raising her little sister on a Yorkshire farm.  Their mother had abandoned them and their father had died; he had also defaulted on his rent, thus losing their tenancy and, thus, bringing the police to their door to evict them.  What actually happened on that day is revealed in the third of three 45-minute episodes.

Released from prison, Ruth lands a distasteful but reasonably well-paying job in a meat packing plant.  She longs to be reunited with her sister (if she could only find her) but the adoption agreement of yore requires them to stay apart.  She meets Davison and Finnerans characters (he is a lawyer also) when she walks on the grounds of her old farmhouse (now converted into their posh residence).  Davison agrees to try to help her reconnect with her sister, but advises her to keep it low-key, lest she spook the adoptive parents (who are not even required to meet with her, much less inform her of where theyand her sisterlive).

There is, unfortunately for Ruth, a bitter complication.  The sons of one of the murdered policemen discover where she is living; one is determined to either bludgeon her mercilessly or assault her sister, thus teaching her the lesson in loss which they deal with every day.

This is the set-up and the plot proceeds with a great deal of conflict-generated drama and other ominous elements (the musical score, for one, the rumor that the farmhouse is inhabited by a ghost [one of the dead policemen?] for another).  The acting is superb.  Suranne Joness mastery of the local accent is very impressive.  The suspense is edge-of-the-seat intense, but not turn-your-eyes-away oppressive.  The conclusion is very satisfying, but not maudlin or unearned.  The direction and cinematography are first-rate; a 10-minute behind the scenes piece describes such technical details as the choice of color palette and the ways in which it is achieved.  This is first-rate British television drama; relish it.

Now for the DVD player issue.  Do not purchase this disc unless you have an all-regions player.  It will not work on a standard U.S. machine.  However, it is very easy to acquire an all-regions player now and they are simple to operate: you put in the disc (from whatever region), the player reads the code and plays your show.  Done and dusted, as the British say.  Amazon.com sells these players.  You can get a good one for approximately $100.  I recommend those made by Pioneer.  Once you have one you have two clear advantages.  You can pick and choose according to price.  (In the case of this show, e.g. the Amazon.co.uk is selling it for 8 pounds, approximately one-half the cost of the currently-available American version (the same disc).  You can also get shows that are released in the U.K. first, without having to wait for the U.S. release.  The all-regions player pays for itself very quickly and also gives you first crack at many U.K. productions.",1455667200,4,3570,4.991525423728813

8328898,5,B001O2BEW6,"This is a clean DVD, and a really well done movie.  Good writing, good casting, good directing, good cinematography.  I don't have a region-free DVD player, so I use one of my old Mac Powerbook G4s to play Region 2 DVDs like this one and use the video-out and audio-out ports to connect it to my TV.  I was already familiar with screenwriter Sally Wainwright and actor Suranne Jones from the Scott and Bailey TV series, so I took this step back in time to see them both in the context of a very different story.",1439769600,2,511,4.302083333333333

8328901,5,B001O2BEW6,"""Unforgiven"" is one of the most enthralling mystery-dramas to come from UK telly in the past decade. It's a RED Production (they gave us Queer as Folk, Scott and Bailey, Last Tango in Halifax, Single Father, The Second Coming, and many more) and stars the fantastic Suranne Jones (formerly Karen on Coronation Street, now Rachel Bailey on Scott and Bailey).
The rest of the cast is equally brilliant and features the absolute cream of Northern British drama: Peter Davison (Doctor Who #5), Jack Deam (Clocking Off), Douglas Hodge (Red Cap), Jemma Redgrave (Bramwell), Siobhan Finneran (Downton Abbey), the dreamy Matthew McNulty and the studly Will Mellor.
The Yorkshire locations are stunning and the presentation is first rate. It's a great shame that this 3 part ITV drama never made it to US television but you can get it here, for quite a low price. Don't be put off by the Region 2 warning: most dvd players are easily hacked to allow discs from other territories to play and digital television has removed the NTSC/PAL divide.",1383523200,6,1033,4.908571428571428
