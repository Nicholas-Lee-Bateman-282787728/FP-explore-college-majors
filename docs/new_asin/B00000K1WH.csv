Watch paint dry or grass grow, tweeze eyebrows, or visit the dentist ... all of these seemed more pleasing options than  watching some ""train movie.""  But in my attempts to get in this  friend's best graces, I agreed to act interested.  Thing is ... I didn't  have to act.  It wasn't a documentary about cogs and coal ... it was truly  a human interest story that drew me in.  The story unveiled itself over the  course of the 2 year span in such a way that I truly felt a part of the  journey.  Having viewed both videos, I wish that I would have actually seen  the Freedom Train when it came through my town in 1976.  Nevertheless, this  film's retracing of the Freedom Train's conception, vision, planning,  mishaps, course, precious and interesting cargo, and familial bonds  developed makes me feel even more a part of the whole adventure than if I  had been ""dragged"" to see it in '76 when I was a whiny little  girl.  I have a higher appreciation, not only for the idea and vision  itself, but for the incredible efforts contributed by those with this  dream.  I encourage any of you with the opportunity to share in this  experience to do so.  You may not only be surprised by the appeal of this  film, but also by your own expanding array of interests.",943401600,,1362,4.434959349593496
