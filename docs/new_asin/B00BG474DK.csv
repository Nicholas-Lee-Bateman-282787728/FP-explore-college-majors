5615888,3,B00BG474DK,"A stark and minimalist film that seems to capture the drudgery and struggles of farm life in the ""Old West"" following the Civil War.  The language is often garbled and most likely reflects the authentic speech patterns of that class and era.  Even the subtitles are rife with notations that read, ""Inaudible.""  Of historical interest in the unrelenting and deadly animosity wrought within families whose sons and fathers had to choose between fighting for the Confederacy or the Union. At times, this is a violent movie filled with themes of suspicion, rivalry, greed, sadism, fratricide and patricide.  The Three Star rating reflects the uncommon slowness with which the story unfolds as well the dialogue issues cited above.",1371513600,3,726,5.17948717948718
5615889,5,B00BG474DK,"The genre is alive, well and evolving in a positive way.  What I particularly liked was the depth of the story and its intensity with the absence of cliches and audience pandering.  Also, one could viscerally experience the grittiness of the frontier and be mentally provoked by the contention between morality and self interest. Finally, the cinematography was superb in the old fashioned way.  There is much more to this film than the usual fare. A must see for anyone serious about Westerns.",1371427200,10,494,4.927710843373494
5615890,5,B00BG474DK,"I cannot recommend this film enough.  The acting is superb; each aspect of the production is authentic to the time period and locale.  These elements, in combination with the compelling storyline, make this film an immensely enjoyable ode to classic westerns such as Once Upon A Time in The West.  It's also beautifully filmed on 35mm!",1369958400,,335,4.946428571428571

5615894,4,B00BG474DK,"Above average script and acting make this a bit of a revelation. So many backyard westerns made by over zealous devotees or country music stars (talkin to you Trace, Dwight, etc.) are just bad ranging to awful. So it's a bit of a shock after throwing away things like ""Swift Justice"" when you see a coherent story with decent acting making good use of the country around it. I may be grading this a little higher because of it but I don't pretend to be Ebert, Siskel or Kael. And this film deserves a little extra for standing out.",1472256000,6,531,4.373737373737374

5615901,3,B00BG474DK,"This film had potential to be great. The scenery was great. Parts of it felt real, but other parts felt so amateurish. I enjoyed Barlow Jacobs' character Wade McCurry the most. I disliked the ending although it was unexpected which, ironically, is what people have come to expect. Yea...the ending somewhat killed it for me. The antagonists felt like one out of a hallmark film. Again though, I wish there could've been more focus on Wade McCurry.",1379289600,,447,4.818181818181818
5615902,4,B00BG474DK,"When the movie started off, it was definitely slow paced. You are thrown into the middle of events you don't yet understand and it takes a while for the strands of the movie to weave together. Towards the end, there is definitely tension and the urge to see how the movie is going to end. Good performances from the leads, mostly unknowns, good cinematography and a slight mystery set in the west, this indie film won't be for everyone, but fans of westerns will find themselves at home and those who like drama of bang bang shoot-em-up plots will be pleased. I recommend this movie to western and drama film fans.",1378598400,5,614,4.54054054054054

*Plot analyzed*

Dead Man's Burden is a completely average Western film. Although it is commonplace, it is still nice to see Westerns being made. The New
Mexico scenery is always stunning to behold, but the acting is quite average. No one stands out at all. Some of the scenes are just plain
routine, since the cast can not elevate them beyond the limits of their paltry acting range. Some may like this style, as it reflects a
homegrown flavor that are found in many of today's Westerns.

A brother returns to home to find most of his family dead, and his sister may be responsible. It is slow, at times a bit soporific. It's
still worth a watch.
