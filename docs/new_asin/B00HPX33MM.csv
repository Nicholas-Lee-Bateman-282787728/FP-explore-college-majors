6195396,4,B00HPX33MM,"First a brief note: . I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as reviews of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by Most Recent first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to the Bluray Combo pack.

This is a co-production from India and France (though there is nothing French about it  except that it screened at the Cannes Film Festival). The film played a bunch of other firm festivals and is now making its way to home video.  (I was provided a screener from the US distributor.) I will leave you to read earlier reviews to learn about the plot, but will say that the story of two people (a young woman who is trying to keep her marriage together and an older man  a government employee ready for retirement and lonely since his wife died) unfolds slowly, like the messages that they exchange in lunch boxes that are delivered each day in Bombay. (I was unaware of this amazing system , which employees over 5,000 delivery men, until watching this film. The acting is superb and you are drawn into the characters.

Now on to the Bluray/DVD version.  The film, by first time Director Ritesh Batra (who has lived in the US for many years), is in both Hindi and English. What is strange is that there seems to be no rational reason for when the characters speak each language. A conversation will stat in Hindi and switch to English and vice versa. Its confusing. But, more important are the subtitles.  Recent films from Sony Pictures have had subtitles that were easy to read  often in bright yellow. This film has all the English subtitles in WHITE letters and  because many of the scenes have yellow or white backgrounds, it is extremely hard to read the subtitles, even on a large screen TV (mine is 42). I had to strain  and often hit the pause button  to follow at many parts and, honestly, there were words that were impossible to read. But I got through the film  and really liked it. I just wanted to alert you about the contract in those subtitles. And that is the reason I deducted a star from my rating.

The BD has one bonus (well, other than the two-minute trailer). It is a full length commentary by Director Batra. I did not listen to the full commentary but only the first 10 minutes or so  mostly to hear about the history of the lunch box system in Bombay. Batra, who I said, has lived in New York for many years has virtually no accent and is easy to understand. If you have the time (108 minutes) yiu may find the commentary interesting.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6195398,4,B00HPX33MM,"Written and directed by Ritesh Batra, The Lunchbox (Hindi title ""Dabba"") is a wonderfully intimate film about two lonely people whose disparate lives are accidentally connected by the mis-delivery of a lunchbox.  In the hands of a lesser director, it would've probably been merely a light romantic comedy.  But in Batra's very talented hands, The Lunchbox is much, much more than that, bringing us deeply into the characters' lives and showing how sometimes it's the smallest things that can make the biggest difference.

Saajan Fernandes (marvelously played by Irrfan Khan) is a lonely accountant working in the claims department of a company in Mumbai.  Middle-aged and approaching retirement, he exists more than he lives, having lost any feeling for anyone or anything since the death of his wife some years earlier.  Ila (Nimrat Kaur in an equally marvelous performance) is a lonely young wife/mother who lives with her young daughter and emotionally distant husband in an apartment in Mumbai.  Her only real human contact comes from her upstairs neighbor, an older woman, ""Auntie"" Deshpande (Bharati Achrekar), whom we never actually see but who carries on conversations with her through their open windows, chatting about their daily lives and giving advice about cooking.  Wanting desperately to revive some sense of connection with her cold and indifferent husband, Ila tries to prepare special lunches for him, hoping as the old saying goes, to find a way to his heart through his stomach.

A chance of fate intervenes when Ila's specially prepared lunch mistakenly ends up being delivered to Saajan's office instead of her husband's.  Although Saajan notices that something seems different about his lunch, he gives the matter little thought.  He does, however, eat all of it, finding it quite delicious, and so when the lunchbox is returned to Ila that afternoon, she is surprised and delighted to find it completely empty, thinking that her husband must have enjoyed it for once.  But when he comes home, he is just as cold and indifferent as ever, and only when she asks about it does he say anything, mentioning that the cauliflower was okay.  Which tells her that something is amiss since the lunch she prepared didn't have any cauliflower.  The next day, she prepares another lunch, this time sending it off with a note inside, telling whoever the lunch gets delivered to that he must've gotten the lunch she had prepared for her husband by mistake, but that she appreciated the fact that he had clearly enjoyed it, judging by the empty returns, and that it made her feel appreciated, if only for a little while.  Reading the note, Saajan is hesitant at first, but afterwards sends back a note that that day's lunch was a bit salty.  Which prompts Ila to fix something spicy for the next lunch - with a new note.  Which prompts Saajan to send back a note about his having to eat a banana to dampen the heat in his mouth from the spice, mentioning off-handedly that he sees that so many people have nothing but a banana for their lunch.  Gradually a correspondence between them builds as they share their observations, their thoughts and eventually their feelings, he about missing the life he had with his wife, she about the life she doesn't have with her husband.

There are a number of side-plots occurring in the film, foremost of which are Saajan's having to train an overly eager new-hire Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) as his replacement, Ila's having to deal with her father having terminal cancer and her mother's having to take care of him, and Auntie Deshpande's husband who's been in a coma for years. The real importance of these sub-plots is that through them we see how Saajan and Ila are both starting to see the world around them with new eyes, both of them coming alive again, their perspectives changing as a direct result of their chance correspondence. It is to writer/director Batra's immense credit that he imbues his film with a great deal of subtlety, little things like the sound of a particular song, the visual of a ceiling fan, the news of a random tragedy, each seen and reacted to by Saajan and Ila in their separate lives but making the point that they're both in the same world.

Another small but delightful detail is how Batra portrays Auntie Deshpande's character.  You never actually see Ila's chatty upstairs neighbor though you hear her voice, hear her changing the music and looking through drawers for things. But you do see this basket she lowers to share cooking ingredients with Ila, and through the way Batra has the basket bob and weave, he gives the audience a visual feel for Auntie Deshpande's personality.  I've never seen a dangling basket that manages to coax, tease, and nudge the way this one did in the film.  An extraordinarily nice touch.

Important note: if you're not from India or familiar with the dabbawala system of lunchbox deliveries, I strongly suggest either googling it or looking it up on Wikipedia (from which I derived much of the following description) as it is important to fully understanding the film. It is also something of a fascinating subject in its own right. Started in Mumbai back in 1890, the dabbawala system is a complex, highly organized and remarkably reliable delivery system that collects hot food in lunch boxes (or ""dabbas"") from the residences of workers in the late morning, delivers the lunches to the workplace utilizing various modes of transport, predominantly bicycles and the railway trains, and returns the empty boxes back to the customer's residence that afternoon. They are also made use of by prominent meal suppliers in Mumbai where they ferry ready, cooked meals from central kitchens to the customers and back. The workers who handle the deliveries are ""dabbawalas"".  What is also important to understand is that the chances of a lunchbox being delivered to the wrong place are on the order of once in every eight _million_ deliveries. Which is what makes the key event in ""The Lunchbox"" such a remarkable oddity.

In truth I only have two criticisms about the film.  The first is strictly a technical one.  Being an English speaker, I'm dependent on the sub-titles in films to follow what's going on, and I found that the choice of sub-title format in The Lunchbox often made them difficult to read, being very light text against what was frequently a light background.  The other was what I felt was a loss of focus and pacing in the latter part of the film which made it a bit harder to follow what was going on and also felt less intimate than what came before it.

But that aside, The Lunchbox is truly something worth seeing, engaging you in a way that too few films ever do and prompting us to think about our own lives and about what really matters to us.

Highly recommended.",1399680000,21,6807,4.848144952545297
6195399,4,B00HPX33MM,"THE LUNCHBOX has emerged as top-grossing foreign film at the US, and deservedly so.  Set in contemporary Mumbai, it is a gentle tale of a burgeoning relationship between about-to-retire office worker Saajan Fernandes (Irfan Khan) and homeworker Ila (Nimrat Kaur), who are brought into epistolary contact with one another due to an honest mistake: every day Ila makes lunch for her husband Rajeev (Nakul Vaid), but those responsible for delivering it inadvertently deliver it to Saajan's office instead.  Hence Saajan comes to love Ila's cooking, instead of the cauliflower ordered daily from a commercial firm.  Ritesh Batra's film is about loneliness, as experienced by Saajan as he commutes daily to a pen-pushing job in an office, and Ila as she stays at home trying in vain to please her spouse.  Batra's camera contains numerous close-ups of the two protagonists as they conduct their daily lives, each trying to make the best of a stultifying routine.  Eventually they find a way out through letters written to one another, and sent in the lunchbox: Ila writes letters in the full lunchbox, Saajan replies and puts then notes in the empty lunchbox.  However this film eschews easy solutions - although the two arrange to meet in a local caf, Saajan finds that he lacks the courage to fulfill that meeting, as he becomes conscious of the age-gap between himself and Ila, and his own feelings of mortality.  The film ends much as it begins.  The film explores an interesting paradox: while Mumbai's streets teem with people, cars and human life, its citizens are prisoners of their own lives.  We seldom see Ila except in inferior shots, as she cooks food or sorts through her washing; Saajan is photographed either sitting in his dingy apartment, or in an office full of workers in which no one actually speaks.  He establishes a good working relationship with fellow-worker Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), but we always feel that Saajan is keeping himself in check, either unable (or unwilling) to commit himself to a lasting friendship.  Director Batra explores other paradoxes: the film contains images of perpetual movement - Saajan travels daily on the train to work, Ila takes a taxi to find Saajan's office - but the protagonists' lives are dominated by stasis.  Perhaps that's one of the characteristics of all metropolitan lives.  Batra's screenplay contains a fair amount of humor, arising principally from the contrast between the eager-to-please Shaikh and the inhibited Saajan (just watch him looking guiltily around at his fellow-diners as he enjoys another one of Ila's delicious meals), that helps to render THE LUNCHBOX a memorable experience.",1398902400,2,2663,5.122401847575058
6195400,4,B00HPX33MM,"A small but interesting film about simple people in India today, simple is a way of speaking since the main character is dealing with public finances. But that is not really important. There is no ostentatious Hindu religion. There is no Muslim religion. We are obviously living among Hindu people and on the train to and from Mumbai, now and then there is a group of children reciting mantras in order to get a coin or two: in other words they are begging. We may also have a set of adult males doing the same, reciting mantras, we assume all along the trip. But that's little. This absence of Hinduism enables the film to be totally silent on the worst problem of India today, the Dalits. This silence on this social problem is surprising, or maybe not so surprising after all. Let's push that modern form of slavery under the table or under the carpet and it does not exist.

The film is just a story about a man who is going to retire. He is aging. Due to a mistake in the lunchbox delivery system he gets the lunchbox from a woman who is trying to re-conquer her husband by cooking special lunches for him. An epistolary relation starts via the lunchbox: message to and message fro. Till a meeting becomes possible. But it is then the aging man discovers he has no right to entertain some illusion about that younger woman, nor nurture illusions in her about a rejuvenating love affair which is nothing but a compensation for her inability to have a relation with her own husband. And he has no right to flatter his ego with the idea that he might still be young, to the point of maybe not retiring after all.

So everything goes right in the end, and he retires and his successor can take over. This successor is a total mystery since he is an absolute orphan but he is not a Dalit, and cannot be one since after some time his girlfriend who eloped with him gets the benediction of her rich father and they get married. Such a man who educated himself and who got experience in other countries before coming back to India is fascinating in a way because we can see everyday in our cities these Hindus from Sri Lanka (Tamils) or from India (Hindis or Tamils) selling fruit at the entrance of underground stations. To expatriate themselves, at least for a while seems to be part of the life experience of a certain proportion of Hindis and Tamils for very different reasons at times, since the Tamils of Sri Lanka mostly went to Europe or Australia and Canada to run away from the civil war of the terroristic Tamil Tigers, though they were then the preys of these Tigers who blackmailed them with their relatives in Sri Lanka to force them to pay the ""revolutionary tax."" The film does not really say how and why that young man expatriated himself.

That's the most surprising aspect of the film. It remains very vague on details and explanations. And in the end it is a very sad film about aging accepted by the main character but that leads him to a life of total idleness he turns into some kind of voyeurism from his terrace into the home of what appears to be a Christian family. Nostalgia for real life, with a family and an activity.

India has to cope with this problem fast otherwise the country will do the same as the population: it will age in idleness and the inability to be productive and creative.

6195401,4,B00HPX33MM,"""The Lunchbox"" (2013 release from India; 105 min.) brings the story of Ila, a house wife stuck in an unhappy marriage. She makes her husband's lunch meal every day, and it gets delivered through Mumbai's famous dabbawalla (an intricate delivery systems). Somehow a mistake is made and the lunchbox is delivered not to her husband, but to Saajan, a widower. Soon Saajan and Ila start communicating back-and-forth through handwritten notes left in the lunch box. Then Ila finds out that her husband is having an affair. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the feature debut of writer-director Ritesh Batra, and what a debut he gives us! Second, the movie addresses many different themes in fine fashion, including of course what constitutes true love but also true happiness. At one point Ila writes to Saajan that she wants to move to Bhutan, ""because they don't have Gross Domestic Product, but Gross National Happiness, and people are always happy there"". There are several parallel secondary stories in the movie, including Saajan being asked to train a newcomer at work, and also Ila's family, with aunts and uncles, and the responsibilities of taking care of older parents. Third, the movie, shot on location in Mumbai, gives a glimpse of what life is like there. I haven't had a chance to visit it yet, but would very much would like to at some point. Fourth, the acting performances, in particular from the 2 leads (the beautiful Nimrat Kaur as Ila and Irfan Khan as Saajan) are outstanding. Last but not least, there is a nice soundtrack, composed by veteran UK film composer Max Richter.

""The Lunchbox"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and the matinee screening I saw this at was PACKED I am happy to say. ""The Lunchbox"" has all the makings of a very solid hit on the art-house theater circuit. I read somewhere that the production budget for this was less than $2 million, proving once again you don't need $100 million or a comic book super hero to make a compelling movie. If you are in the mood for something that is light years away from your standard Hollywood fare (or even Bollywood, for that matter), you will be in for a treat. ""The Lunchbox"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1396742400,8,2327,4.771712158808933
6195402,5,B00HPX33MM,"Brace yourself. This gentle PG-rated drama has no gunshots, no car chases, no sweaty bodies and no blowie uppie stuff. It does, however, have several people to root for and a very clever premise.

An unappreciated wife prepares her husband's lunch each day but he never acknowledges the effort and planning she puts into it. One day, through some sort of clerical error, the lunch is delivered to a widower who thinks it is from the contractor who usually furnishes his meals. He eats every bite and she is gratified to see that her food is appreciated. Her husband however, says he liked the cauliflower, which wasn't in the lunch she sent.

We smile with:
  * Irrfan Kahn (""Life of Pi"") is the widower, soon to be retired, but delighted with the food that comes daily from the wrong cook! He wants to be left alone, but has a deep fear of aging.
  * Nimrat Kaur (""Peddlers"") is the lovely but unappreciated wife, happy that her food is finally being enjoyed.
  * Nawazuddin Siddiqui (""Liar's Dice"") is the ebullient (and VERY handsome) young man hired to replace our hero when he retires. His mother says, ""Sometimes the wrong train takes you to the right station.""
  * Nakul Vaid (""Stalker"") is that unappreciative husband. He has many things on his plate, but his wife's cooking is not one of them!

Mumbai's byzantine lunch-box delivery system is famous for its efficiency. (You have to see it to believe it!) When our heroine tells the deliveryman her lunches are going to the wrong person, he tells her the system was studied by Harvard and they don't make mistakes.

The actors switch seamlessly between Hindi and English, so if you don't see any captions, they are probably speaking English.  When the DVD is available on Amazon, I'll pre-order it. I want this one in my library.",1396051200,23,1788,4.6923076923076925

I saw this movie in the theatre and want the DVD or a digital copy. Get some Indian takeout or sprinkle some curry powder on your popcorn and enjoy a nice movie night.",1394755200,6,430,4.5256410256410255
6195404,5,B00HPX33MM,"This movie creates a touching new twist on a story that might have come across as corny, but doesn't. Mr. Saajan (Irrfan Khan), a retiring accountant, is grieving over the death of his wife and Lla (Nimrat Kaur), a young mother, desires more attention from her husband. Lla sends her husband a special lunchbox and, by accident, the lunchbox is delivered to Mr. Saajan instead. Realizing the meal was misdirected, Lla writes a letter, places it inside the next day's lunchbox and what unfolds are sincere and beautiful messages that changes their lives.

The plot's not unique, but the writers produce an atmosphere in this script that sets it apart. Shot in Mumbai City, India, we roam through the streets and are allowed to observe the people, their traditions, their homes and their work establishments. The dialog is in English much of the time but at times in Hindu with English subtitles which immerses you further into the culture. Irrfan and Nimrat's characters have their own stories that are spectacular to watch and, once these characters start writing to each other, we see a whole new side to both.

My favorite character is Mr. Saajan. Khan creates this man who reaches out to someone who he does not even know. His role is heartbreaking to see and you feel the emotions he is experiencing. For anyone who has lost a loved one, you can really identify with his emptiness.

My favorite scene is when Mr. Saajan is watching a show that his wife had taped. He remembers watching her and watching the show that made her laugh. You see his face change as he understands the joy she got from the comedy. We see how, a moment that brought joy in the past can still bring joy now, only in a different way.

The message in this story is, Sometimes the wrong train can bring you to the right station. Lla is unsure what to do when she realizes the lunchbox is going to a perfect stranger. Mr. Saajan is not sure what to do when the notes start to touch his heart. So they both feel they are on the wrong train.

I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to age 11 to 18. There is use of cigarettes and subject matter that is not appropriate for younger audiences. Check it out to see what I'm talking about.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE LUNCHBOX [2013] is director Ritesh Batras debut feature film, where we see a romance that takes place in Mumbai, but its style is more Hollywood than Bollywood, and Old Hollywood at that. Though director Ritesh Batra and his cinematographer Michael Simmonds, shot the film on location in the bustling modern Indian city, with a naturalism alien to both American studios and present-day Indian musical extravaganzas.

THE LUNCHBOX film has the measured pace and classical restraint of a romance from the 1930s or 1940s. The comedy is more wry than uproarious, the melodrama gently poignant rather than operatic, and the sentimentality just sweet enough to be satisfying rather than bothersome. The main characters Ila [Nimrat Kaur], a neglected housewife, and Saajan Fernandes [Irrfan Khan], a widowed office worker nearing retirement and communicate through personalised handwritten letters and home-cooked meals.

Their world has been only lightly touched by the latest social and technological advances. Ila launders her husbands shirts by hand and cooks his lunches that are supposed to be delivered to him, via bicycle, rail and the shoulders of white-jacketed couriers called Dabbawala (Lunchboxes), through the streets of Mumbais elaborate and storied meal-delivery system. Saajan Fernandes, labours at a wooden desk in a crowded workplace that is anything but paper free. For 35 years, without error or complaint, Saajan Fernandes has doggedly ploughed through endless stacks of folders, keeping accounts with a ruler and pencil.

With Saajan Fernandes he has a warm heart that lurks beneath his dour exterior and is something the audience will assume right away and this is a comfortingly familiar kind of film we come to expect from the continent of India. Saajan Fernandes relishes understatement, occasionally allowing the characters suppressed emotion to peek out from behind his quiet, standoffish demeanour, and is plagued, and eventually befriended, by Shaikh [Nawazuddin Siddiqui], the eager young man who is his designated replacement. Shaikh is an orphan who subsists on a few pieces of fruit at lunch and an inexhaustible supply of positive thinking, represents the striving of poorer Indians scrambling toward the middle class.

As the days go by, Ila and Saajan Fernandes use the lunchbox notes to unburden their thoughts, relieved at having a confidante in each other. Though chaste and brief, the messages become the focus of their days, zeroing in on their loneliness and dissatisfaction with society today and they also exchange appreciations of old TV shows. Director Ritesh Batras adeptly plays on the tension of will they or won't they meet, making good decisions based on character and situation rather than the need to uplift an audience without causing any tension.

Here director Ritesh Batra has an understanding of visuals, in collaboration with Michael Simmonds (Director of Photography), results in a meaningful use of space, such as the way the multi-stacked lunchbox sits at the far end of Saajan Fernandess desk, a conspicuous tower separated from him and his paperwork. Even more important for composition and character, early scenes of Saajan Fernandess commute have him in the middle of the packed train cars, clearly hemmed in by society, while later on he is shifted to a space by the open window, allowing him to breathe in the possibilities opening up before him.

Director Ritesh Batra, who has also done the screenplay for the film written THE LUNCHBOX, has allowed his smashing actors tremendous room to improvise, all the while himself sketching in nuanced details about the city, its food-ferries, the Dabbawala (lunchboxes), and the many disparities in the city of Mumbai is crammed within the film scenario. It is a film of multiple pleasures, small ones and overwhelming ones and exquisitely crafted ones and layered one on top of the other, with something for everyone, and  so much for the cinematic feast before your eyes, you wish you was in the film enjoying all what you view. There are plenty of moments to treasure in THE LUNCHBOX, and they are all small and delicately crafted. Those looking for romance will swoon with delight as they discover two lonely people can find a way to make things work. All in all, the director Ritesh Batra certainly delivers what he intended the film to portray about all aspects of human life in India and is the most optimistic film to be released in 2013, especially when you realise Indian cinema is undergoing a renaissance, right in front of your eyes.

Blu-ray Image Quality  Curzon Artificial Eye has pulled out all the stops with this Blu-ray release, as the 1080p image resolution looks spectacular. Certain scenes and environments have a very pastel look to them and there were no signs of contrast or sharpness fluctuations whatsoever and it has a flawless presentation. With all the food you get to view, you feel you want to feast on it all, and made me want to get my passport out and take a trip to Mumbai, and you can almost feel India right there in your living room. Black levels remained deep and inky and the colour palette is sensational. There are many uses of colour throughout the film and it is a very cool colour palette that puts the viewer at ease and they are a work of art unto themselves and its one of my favourite things about the film. Flesh tones look also very natural, so making this a very clean and natural looking pristine image of the film and are a flawless victory throughout the film. You get very nice subtitles, but sadly they only give us 50% of what the actors are saying and found this very frustrating and so I found this to be very unprofessional om the part Curzon Artificial Eye. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Curzon Artificial Eye brings us two audio experiences in the form of Hindi: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Hindi: 2.0 LPCM Audio Stereo, but luckily with English subtitles. For such a low-key film you would not expect to have that oomph factor, but during those scenes that feature any given character out and about in the streets of Mumbai and either walking, driving, or taking the bus, the elements and busy-ness of the environment really livens up the surround audio track. I felt like a fly on the wall riding the bus and it is a very immersive track. There are many instances where you may hear an engine revving up or when the bus is revving up, and the speaker channels get a real revving up in itself. The City of Mumbai is heavily populated and busy and you will feel as if you were walking the streets as the rear channels have every background noise coming at you at the same time without feeling cluttered. Its an extremely clean ambient experience. Dialogue is crystal clear, so be prepared for many instances of English being spoken by many of the characters and seem to be very fluent in both languages and the centre speaker handles it perfectly well.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Short Film: Caf Regular, Cairo [2012] [1080p] [1.78:1] [10:58] Director Ritesh Batras award-winning Arabic language short film Caf Regular, Cairo has been screened at over 40 International Film Festivals and won 12 awards. For the most part this is a charmingly frank film that mostly gets by on how very simple it is. Here we see a young couple having a discussion at a table in the Caf Regular in Cairo. They have been together for two years but for Mai there are frustrations bottling up and the divorce of her sister and an interaction with some foreigners on a train have brought the subject of sex to the fore front of her mind and a subject that Alaa is not particularly comfortable discussing in a public place, who is a typical Egyptian, who is a typical misogynous dinosaur in his attitude towards discussing sex. The film is essentially a dialogue scene for just over 10 minutes and means that the challenge is to hold the attention of the viewer and for me this worked really well. Fortunately, both Abozeed and Ezzat are very natural with one another, nervous of those around, taken aback with one another but yet still intimate as a couple and in this regard the film works very well. For the most part the subject matter works very well and mainly because it is a very natural discussion, even if it is culturally taboo in Egypt. It does still work because of the script direction and the nature of the discussion allows us to see the desire of the next generation to not be restrained by tradition but at the same time still have the desire to observe these two people talking frank, especially when it comes the subject of having sex to be the central subject. That said it was still a very enjoyable little short film thanks to the topic and how naturally it was presented. Cast: Alaa Ezzat and Mai Abozeed. Director: Ritesh Batra. Producers: Alaa Mosbah, Guneet Monga and Wajdi Elian, Screenplay: Ritesh Batra. Cinematography: Islam Abdelsamie.

Special Feature: RITESH BATRA: Director of THE LUNCHBOX [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:55] Here we have a very intimate interview with director Ritesh Batra. Here Ritesh explains that in 2007 he wanted to make a documentary about the people who deliver the Dabbawala (Lunchboxes) and was involved with them for a couple of weeks and just personally with them finding out all what they do, with just Ritesh on his own without notes and camera crew, and in the process Ritesh became very close friends to these people and heard all about their intimate stories in what happened to them. So as things moved on with hearing all these intimate stories, this is when Ritesh started to do his screenplay, especially with more fascinating characters he encountered. One of the men started to tell his story about a bored housewife who did different cooking of meals every day and how a mistake in the delivery of the lunchbox changes their lives forever. So as Ritesh went through the process of the screenplay, more characters started to evolve and Ritesh also informs us that although he was brought up with the Hindi language, he had to write the screenplay in English and some of the cast helped him translate the words into the Hindi language. Ritesh also informs us on the Directors he admires, which include Louis Malle [French film director] and Ingmar Bergman [Swedish film director]. As Ritesh explains his thinking about the process he went through for his film THE LUNCHBOX, we also get several clips from the film. Ritesh also allowed the main actors to improvise, as he felt very confident in this situation. Also the main actress Nimrat Kaur in the film, Ritesh took ages to find this actress, and found her performance in the film totally perfect. Despite the interview being just over 10 minutes, it was still fascinating hearing the personal views of the director Ritesh Batra talking about the process of producing and directing this film and is at the same time really fascinating to hear him talk and someone I could listen to for ages, as Ritesh Batra is a very engaging young man. This definitely gets a five star rating from me. The interview was carried out by Journalist Anne Tezenas du Montcel.

Special Feature: NIMRAT KAUR: THE LUNCHBOX [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [00:00] Here we have the second intimate interview, but this time we have the actress Nimrat Kaur who was the main character of the down trodden housewife in the film THE LUNCHBOX, that was directed by Ritesh Batra. Nimrat informs us that the housewife was like a prisoner in her own home and at the same time feeling trapped, as is Saajan Fernandes, the ill-tempered Mumbai office worker, and both characters are also prisoners in their own world, but hoping one day that a ray of sunshine will enter their lives. When Ritesh Batra was in Berlin, met up with Nimrat Kaur, while viewing clips from her previous films, and when Ritesh and Nimrat met up in Bombay later on, Nimrat felt the meeting went very well and also felt a great energy from Ritesh, who eventually let Nimrat read the scriptand really fell in love with the whole concept of the film, and of course was now really keen to appear in the film. Because of the character Nimrat plays, feels again trapped, because the housewife is not allowed to be independent from a her husband, because most of the time he is very cold towards his wife, but has also not in love with her anymore, so this leads her to feel slightly cold towards her child, but tries her best to not show the child is not loved. Nimrat comments about the one scene in the film that really resonated towards in a very strong way, which was when Nimrat had to visit her Mother, because her Father had died, and was expected to be emotionally upset, because normally in India there is a great deal of pouring out of great emotions when someone in the family passes away, and Nimret found that scene particularly interesting, and especially felt her character should have everything revolve round her, especially because of the way her husband is so cold towards her and is crying out to be loved. To prepare her part as Ila, Nimrat spent six months with the script before shooting started, and felt it was a very satisfying process, and felt working with director Ritesh Batra was totally brilliant and very rewarding, as well as being very democratic experience, especially over the 29 days solid filming, and was also at the same time very exhausting, especially working is a very confined apartment, especially with all the crew in the rooms as well that really tested their endurance. Nimrat has met many Indian women who were very happy to just be a housewife 365 days of the year, but also has met other Indian business women who were very successful, but also felt at the same time felt very lonely, especially not having any kind of emotional outlet. Nimret also gets very upset when she hears especially via the news media about the terrible violence against women in India and feels this is down to a lack of education on the part of the men and also feels it stems from the common man who has to change their ways, especially their old fashioned misogynous attitude. Once again we get lots of clips from the film where Nimrat Kaur is illustrating different aspect of her relevant comments relating to the film. Once again this was a very engaging interview and the actress Nimrat Kaur is really lovely and like the previous interview I could have listened to Nimrat for a very long time, as all her conversations were very interesting to listen to. This also get a five star rating from me. The interview was carried out by Journalist Anne Tezenas du Montcel.

Theatrical Trailer [2013] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:47] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE LUNCHBOX. This has English subtitles that is far superior to what you get to view in the film.

Finally, with the film THE LUNCHBOX we find two strangers fall in love over a lunchbox and their letters that get exchanged and do they ever meet? Like a tiffin carrier, THE LUNCHBOX has so many levels and it is the story of a man so lonely, he has forgotten what any companionship really means. It is the story of a suburban housewife, who is deeply alone. It is the story of meeting via eating. It is a love-story and a love-letter at the same time to Mumbai, to the trains that go click-clack over long distances, to Dabbawala (lunchboxes) and rain, to love and life, sugar and spice, the despair and the hope that mark every heart. Warming this feast of delight is the wonderful screenplay, you have sound recording that must be heard to be believed. Its finesse qualifies this charmer as India's potential entry to the Oscars, and of course got rewarded with lots of Awards and Nominations. THE LUNCHBOX film is an unusual banquet, raising a bitter-sweet toast to life, so dig in! Highly Recommended!

This tender, touching story focuses on the quiet lives of desperation many ""ordinary"" people lead.  The harshness of these realities can be achingly close to home for many of us, but are rendered a more safe distance by the exotic location and another culture.  The totally sad moment when we hear of the tragic jump of mother and child reminded me of an identical even that happened in Boston a few years back when an expatriate Mom from Asia jumped with her children from a luxury apartment.  Desperation and the sorrow of loneliness are interwoven with our human experience and often lead us to do extraordinary things to end our psychological suffering - even when it is completely invisible to others.

6195550,5,B00HPX33MM,"Saajan (Irrfan Khan) is an accountant near retirement, working at his desk in the crowded offices of a Mumbai business. He receives his lunch from a delivery service every day, and takes it to the common lunchroom to eat. (The lunchbox is an Indian style&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiffin-Food-Carrier/dp/B005S4LYS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiffin Food Carrier</a>, which by the way looks like a very practical and useful alternative to our very pedestrian brown bags!)

One day he finds a hand-written note in his lunchbox. He also discovers the food is suddenly of a much higher quality and taste. Somehow the delivery service (known as dubbawalas) has mixed up the lunch boxes, bringing him one not from the local provider (of what is probably mediocre quality lunches) but rather a home-made lunch, made with love and care by a housewife in Mumbai (Nimrat Kaur). She has written the note, intending for her husband to receive it, looking to recover some of the spark in their marriage through the mechanism of the daily lunch preparation and her notes to him.

As you might expect, a romance (at a distance) develops, between the much younger housewife, who feels neglected by her husband and begins to suspect that he is having an affair, and the older accountant who is simply making his way through his final days at the job and beginning to think about what he might do in his retirement.

It's quite a lovely story, with the characters portrayed with understatement and compassion. Both Khan and Kaur are superb in their roles, and with the added spark of Nawazuddin Siddiqui in a supporting role portraying a younger accountant in Khan's office, who is hoping to take Khan's place when he does retire.

Another enjoyable aspect of this movie is the picture it gives of modern day life in Mumbai, India, showing in the various scenes some images of how the life of the city and it's inhabitants is actually lived, without being dressed up or exaggerated.

Altogether well done and delightful. Nominated for a whole list of awards in 2013, and winner of awards for the actors, screenwriter, director, and movie overall. Unfortunately, the film was not submitted for consideration at the Academy Awards that year. It seems that only one film from India can be considered each year, and for some reason the Film Federation of India decided to submit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Road/dp/B00EJLYSCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Road</a>&nbsp;instead.

A shame, but in spite of being overlooked at the Oscars it seems that this film is now receiving some well-deserved exposure and attention here in the U.S. I watched it myself recently on the Starz network. I recommend it highly.",1437782400,,2798,5.362186788154897

MOVIE REVIEW: THE LUNCHBOX @ANDPICTURESIN #LUNCHBOXANDYOU : EXCELLENT STORY FOOD

There are three good artists in this movie  Nimrat Kaur  as Ila, Irrfan Khan  as Saajan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui  as Shaikh. There is another good actress of her time  Lillette Dubey  as Ilas mother. The movie Lunchbox has been directed by Ritesh Batra, and was able to bag Filmfare Award 2013 for the best movie. It also bagged Critics Week Viewers Choice Award also known as Grand Rail dOr. The movie was honored by screening at International Critics Week at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

The story goes like this. Ila has a neglectful husband Rajiv who does not pay attention to her. She tries to impress her by sending her lunch cooked by herself. All such lunchboxes are delivered by Dubbawala (delivery guys). The lunchbox lands into the hands of wrong person (Saajan) who is a widower and orders his food from a restaurant. His Lunchbox also comes through the same Dubbawala.

Aloo-Gobhi has a good role to play in the story. Ila gets completely clean lunchbox that day and thinks Rajiv would praise her in the evening after coming back from office. But it does not happen. Ila gets to know that the lunchbox had landed into the hands of some other person and it is that person who consumed and enjoyed all the food that she specially cooked for Rajiv to impress her. Next day she sends a letter in the lunchbox stating that she knows that the lunchbox she had sent for her husband had got exchanged and the guy who enjoyed it is you, perhaps. Saajan sends a reply that the vegetable had excess of salt instead of a Thank you note.

The story evolves with more such interactions between Saajan and Ira where they start exchanging their views on many issues, one among those issues is Ilas neglectful husband. The friendship grows further and the story takes an interesting route.

A must watch  for all who love to watch natural acting, good story and an offbeat theme. The movie grabbed substantial number of awards from various Institutes of Awards/ in various Film Festivals.",1423872000,,2193,5.058333333333334

6195629,5,B00HPX33MM,"The reviewer here is a Texas native.  The Lunchbox (2012) is among the all-time very best movies to come out of India, along with Gandhi (actually a British/Indian co-production, 1982), Salaam Bombay! (social content, 1988), and Chhoti Si Baat (Bollywood comedy, 1975).  At the theater, the movie primarily was in Hindi with subtitles, but there was a smaller amount of English, with south Asian clipped accents, absent subtitles.  One can observe this occasional audio English from a YouTube of the movie trailer.  On first impression, after picking and buying, on Amazon, the cheaper Indian import DVD in preference to the more expensive American DVD that comes coupled with Blu-Ray I didn't need, I thought maybe I'd made a mistake.  That is, looking online again at the import DVD specs, I thought I had a DVD that dubbed Hindi on top of the smattering of English and then subtitled the Hindi in English, rather than just preserving the small amount of English from the original theatrical release.  Not so...once I checked by actually sampling the import DVD.  From all appearances, it's the same as what was at U.S. theaters.  The potential advantages of the Hindi/English subtitled import then become that the Amazon offerings tend to be cheaper than the U.S. DVD/Blu-ray combo, and instead of the Blu-ray a buyer gets a second DVD disc with film commentary by the director and the leading-role actor and actress.",1418428800,2,1420,5.012765957446809

6195640,5,B00HPX33MM,"""The Lunchbox"" is one of those slow, simmering dramas that takes a while to get going. It unfolds against the backdrop of cosmopolitan Mumbai, where a bored and unfulfilled young housewife, Ila, (played by Nimrat Kaur) wonders what is wrong with her marriage. Her life revolves around her young school-age daughter and spending her days preparing lunches for her husband. Once she cooks the meal, she places it carefully in a lunchbox or popularly known as tiffin carriers which is then picked up by a dabbawalla (men whose jobs are to pick up and deliver similar lunchboxes all over the city). Ila hopes her culinary efforts will arouse some emotion in her husband who is aloof and distant towards her. Her efforts are encouraged by an upstairs neighbor (whom we never see, but whose disembodied advice filters down to Ila on a daily basis).

The story gets going when Ila's lunchbox gets delivered to someone else by mistake. The recipient is a lonely widower, Mr. Fernandez (played by Irrfan Khan, who also starred in ""Life of Pi""). A curmudgeon by nature, Fernandez is loath to help train a young man, Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who is to take over his position once he retires in a couple of weeks. Over a period of days and weeks, Fernandez begins to thaw, as he samples one culinary delight after another. Ila, who by now has grown to enjoy the correspondence via the lunch notes exchanged with Fernandez, also begins to blossom as she realizes she has found a kindred spirit who understands her loneliness and is warmed by the well-meaning advice provided by her ""pen-pal"". Fernandez and Shaikh too begin to develop a friendship, especially after Fernandez learns that Shaikh is a lonely orphan with a very kind heart.

I loved this film because it is subtle in its portrayal of loneliness. Fernandez spends his lunch time alone, eagerly looking forward to reading Ila's notes; he returns home to an empty apartment and in the evenings gazes out to the apartment across, where a family dines happily during their evening meal. Ila too is a lonely soul, pining for some affection from her cold and aloof husband. Something about this film resonated with me, partly due to my childhood memories of watching my mother prepare similar lunches for my father in the same type of tiffin carrier. I was but a child, but I could sense the effort and love that went into preparing those meals (the only difference is that my dad genuinely appreciated her efforts). The overarching theme of loneliness and of two souls connecting was also something that appealed to me; it felt very real and credible.

Irrfan Khan is a consummate character actor. He is only in his 40s (I checked) but plays the role of a soon to retire older man very convincingly. Nimrat Kaur too shines in her portrayal of the lonely and yearning Ila. I was rooting for this pair all the way through the film. Some viewers may find the ending rather anti-climactic and unsatisfying, but I felt it was apt. We can't know for sure if these two lonely souls find their way to each other, or if they go their separate ways, and I rather liked the possibility of either. Life itself isn't always neat and tidy and the film reflects that. If you enjoy a gently unfolding human drama, ""The Lunchbox"" just might be something you like.",1416096000,3,3296,4.728695652173913

6195654,4,B00HPX33MM,"While the Amazon listing labels this (among other things) as ""Bollywood"", this is about as far from my impression of what comes to mind when I hear ""Bollywood"" as you can get.  No musical numbers, no melodrama, quiet and 'small' in the best way.  I love Bollywood movies, but this is closer in spirit to a terrific ""indie"" film.

It's a good hearted and well told, subtle 'dramaedy' about the on-paper relationship between a lonely, ignored housewife, and a grumpy older insurance case-worker who starts getting the lunchboxes meant for the woman's husband.

The two soon start writing letters back and forth, which are carried in the filled and emptied lunchbox, and an odd friendship develops. At the same time, the self-isolated insurance worker (Irrfan Kahn in a lovely, understated performance) starts to reluctantly form a friendship with an ambitious, poor young man who has been hired to replace him when he retires. There have been films using the gimmick of two leads having a non face to face relationship before (e.g. 'You've Got Mail'), but this is both quirkier and more low key. The focus is less on romance, and more on these two lonely souls simply getting to know each other, and to tell their stories to someone in a world where no one seems to care.

Nimrat Kaur does a terrific job as the lonesome housewife, as does Nawazuddin Siddlqui as the orphaned worker slowly taken under the wing of his older counterpart.

This isn't a film that will make you laugh out loud, or reduce you to tears. But under the excellent direction of first timer Ritesh Batra, this Indian ""indie"" film will touch your heart and make you smile as you slowly get to know these sad, sometimes foolish, often wise, and always very human characters.",1414454400,,1743,4.774086378737541

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

Saajan Fernandes is a civil service accountant in Mumbai, India, with one month to go on his job before he retires. He subscribes to the ""dabbawalas"" system, where he has his food delivered to his desk from outside of work. Saajan's food comes from a restaurant but due to a mix-up, he receives lunches prepared by another man's wife, Ila. When Ila receives the lunch containers back, they're licked clean and she assumes her husband liked what she made for him. After speaking with her husband, it becomes apparent that he never received the food she had prepared. She decides to keep preparing meals for the stranger, who seems to be enjoying them.

The next note from Saajan suggests that that food is a tad bit salty. Not insulted, Ila decides to adapt her concoctions to his specifications, and seeks culinary advice from her neighbor one flight above, by shouting to her through an open window (we never see the neighbor, Auntie, who apparently is an older confidante).

'The Lunchbox' takes its cue from the old 1940 Lubitsch classic, 'The Shop around the Corner', where two anonymous correspondents form a relationship. The relationship between Saajan and Ila is at the heart of the narrative but it plays out strictly through the off screen narration of the principals.

The dramatic tension arises over whether Saajan can free himself of his depression, as he is a widower, who was devastated by the death of his wife. Ila also faces a crisis when she discovers that her husband has been cheating on her and must decide whether she wants to leave him.

A sub-plot involving Shaikh, the 'orphan' scheduled to take over Saajan's job is perhaps the most charming aspect of the film. At first, Saajan virtually ignores Shaikh and keeps postponing training sessions for the newly hired employee. Shaikh ends up having to forge ahead on his own and incurs the wrath of the boss when it's obvious he has no clue how to do the job. The boss fires Shaikh but Saajan takes the blame and saves his job. Eventually the two become friends, and the friendless Shaikh asks Saajan to be the best man at his wedding.

'The Lunchbox' denouement is designed to be bittersweet but hopeful. Saajan and Ila finally agree to meet; but when Saajan gets cold feet when he shows up at the restaurant where Ila has been waiting for him, she decides not to send him anymore meals. After Ila's father dies, she looks for Saajan but he has already decided to move to another city. Then she decides to move to outside the country to Bhutan, and leave her husband. Saajan changes his mind about moving and on a hopeful note, decides to look for Ila.

Ultimately, the burgeoning romance between Saajan and Ila is not enough for us to completely fall in love with this narrative. One big problem is Saajan's personality. He's such a one note dour character that it's hard to like him for most of the film. Yes I understand he finally comes out of his shell but is this depressing guy really someone you're willing to go along with for the ride for so long? Similarly, Ila is also a bit of a one note, downbeat character too. Her crumbling marriage seems a little too pat and the relationship between her and her husband, seems woefully underdeveloped.

In reality, I hardly think Saajan and Ila are a good couple. Perhaps Saajan's instinct that she was too young for him was a good one. Nonetheless, he's off (in Hollywood fashion) to seek out the newly separated Ila, and win her heart for good.

As a first time director, Ritesh Batra is to be commended. He has a flair for directing his actors and getting most out of his cinematographers. Special mention should go to the composer of some very nice, highly atmospheric music. 'The Lunchbox' was the subject of great controversy in India after the Film Federation of India failed to nominate it for the Academy Awards. Some members felt the premise was flawed since the Dubbawalas could never make such a mistake as delivering the wrong lunch. I would have denied it on the grounds that the simplicity of the screenplay, with its dour principals and sentimental ending, would have precluded it from earning an Oscar nomination.",1412467200,,4222,4.700947225981055

6195680,4,B00HPX33MM,"This in an interesting movie. The all-region DVD played just fine in my relatively old DVD player. The production quality is very different from American-made movies...not filled with background music or a lot of sound, and the film is not as sharp and colorful as we are used to. Be aware that unless you understand Hindi you will have to watch it sub-titled. There is very little action, or scenery, and my husband thought it was quite ""slow"". However I have shared the DVD with a number of friends who agree with me that it is a very touching and worthwhile movie, and a much more realistic portrayal of life in India than...say...Bollywood movies.

BE SURE to check out disc 2, which is the movie with a commentary track. Something I read said the commentary is not subtitled, and it isn't...but it is in ENGLISH, not Hindi! An great added bonus.

I bought the movie because none of the video stores in my area bothered to get a copy. I thought the price from the Amazon seller I chose was very reasonable and my copy arrived quickly.",1411862400,9,1038,4.545454545454546

6195695,5,B00HPX33MM,"The Lunchbox is just what I needed. Its a movie that not only restores my faith in the genre of feel-good dramas, but it reinforces the fact that something simple isn't always a bad thing (and can actually be pretty powerful). From the cinematography to the acting, I cant complain, and thats pretty rare. But somehow, the ingredients that make up this delightful little movie never falter. There wasn't a moment that I wouldve changed, especially when it comes to the original way our two main characters meet.

Their sweet relationship begins due to a mistake in Mumbais lunchbox delivery system. Ila, a young housewife, takes up the task of making her husbands lunch each day and unexpectedly, its not getting to him. She spends hours and hours making a wonderful feast but it ends up going to Saajan, a widowed man who works in an office, by accident. She decides to send him a note in the lunchbox one day and they begin communicating back and forth, turning a simple mishap into something beautiful.

And honestly, its one of the most sincere films Ive seen in a long time. It doesnt feel the need to be in any way grandiose, keeping a quiet and reserved tone throughout (with some comedy sprinkled in at the perfect moments). Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur (who play Saajan and Ila) are absolutely superb, playing off of each other perfectly in every scene.

And whats even more miraculous is that all of this is coming from a first-time director. It has the style and confidence of a film made by someone with years of experience, and I have to commend Ritesh Batra on his outstanding work. It would be a crime if this doesnt receive a nomination for best foreign-language film at the Oscars this year.",1411257600,8,1707,4.645695364238411

6195697,5,B00HPX33MM,"This wonderful little movie is a double treat: it's a sweet, tender story of connection and serendipity, while at the same time giving viewers a fascinating look into the daily inner workings of the city of Mumbai.  That alone is almost worth the price of admission. It's like director Ritesh Batra decided to sneak a secret documentary into his script.  Who in the west knew, for example, about this vast complex of human machinery that delivers lunch to its millions of office workers? Riveting.  [Not to mention that today's hip, tech-centered Open Plan offices have nothing on old-school, top-down Indian workplaces.]

I love Irrfan Khan and would watch him in anything.  While he doesn't disappoint here, the real treat was Nimrat Kaur (less well known here) as Ila, the very definition of understated beauty.  Her plaintive, expressive face lays bare her pain and loneliness.  [Don't be fooled by her smiling visage on the coverbox.  That's never the mood of the film.]

""The Lunchbox"" features one of the best endings I've seen in a film of this nature.  It's subtle, powerful and respectful of the intelligence of the audience to figure it out.",1411171200,,1152,4.953125

6195717,4,B00HPX33MM,"Everyday at midday, something quite unusual happens in Mumbai, India: dozens of bike riders fan out to deliver homemade lunches to workers all across the city. These lunches are literally homemade, produced principally by the wives of these working men, though various restaurants participate in the deliveries as well. One day, the lunch that Ila (Nimrat Kaur) has intended for her husband is mistakenly delivered to someone shes never met, a widower named Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan), a man soon to be retired from his job as a government clerk after 35 years, who lives a life of solitude and loneliness with nothing but memories of his late wife for companionship.

Out of this simple situation, Ritesh Batra, writer and director of The Lunchbox, has fashioned an endearing and observant tale of two total strangers who forge the unlikeliest of long-distance relationships. Through the notes that they pass back and forth to one another along with the lunches, Ila and Saajan open up their hearts in ways that Ila finds herself unable to do with her husband and Saajan has been unable to do since the passing of his wife. For though married with a child, Ila is clearly as lonely and unfulfilled in her life as Fernandes is in his.

Protected by the cloak of anonymity, Ila and Saajan carry on an old-fashioned pen-pal romance in an era in which the rest of us have moved onto chat rooms and instant messages. Then, of course, comes the inevitable momentshould they meet in person, potentially deepening their relationship - or possibly ruining forever the very rare and special thing they already have?

It is best suited for those that are or have been married. It's about rediscovering yourself. It's about feeling dead and feeling alive. It's about loneliness and connection. It's about the sadness of having nothing to look forward to and joy of anticipation. It's about silence and being heard. It's about betrayal and trust. Last but not least, it's about the power and beauty of the written word.

Irfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur, portray the ache of loneliness beautifully, and as time goes on the hope of life and love so poignantly. We see it. We see, we aren't told.

Both Irrfan and his co-star Nimrat Kaur were superb.  There are subtle twists to the plot that should not be mentioned here, but the ad on Amazon for this movie could be misleading, because it suggests this movie could be a light-hearted comedy.  It has a lot of subtle humor but the emotions are intense making the portrayals very real with much compassion for the lives of the participants.

6195822,4,B00HPX33MM,"Written and directed by Ritesh Batra, The Lunchbox (Hindi title ""Dabba"") is a wonderfully intimate film about two lonely people whose disparate lives are accidentally connected by the mis-delivery of a lunchbox. In the hands of a lesser director, it would've probably been merely a light romantic comedy. But in Batra's very talented hands, The Lunchbox is much, much more than that, bringing us deeply into the characters' lives and showing how sometimes it's the smallest things that can make the biggest difference.

Saajan Fernandes (marvelously played by Irrfan Khan) is a lonely accountant working in the claims department of a company in Mumbai. Middle-aged and approaching retirement, he exists more than he lives, having lost any feeling for anyone or anything since the death of his wife some years earlier. Ila (Nimrat Kaur in an equally marvelous performance) is a lonely young wife/mother who lives with her young daughter and emotionally distant husband in an apartment in Mumbai. Her only real human contact comes from her upstairs neighbor, an older woman, ""Auntie"" Deshpande (Bharati Achrekar), whom we never actually see but who carries on conversations with her through their open windows, chatting about their daily lives and giving advice about cooking. Wanting desperately to revive some sense of connection with her cold and indifferent husband, Ila tries to prepare special lunches for him, hoping as the old saying goes, to find a way to his heart through his stomach.

A chance of fate intervenes when Ila's specially prepared lunch mistakenly ends up being delivered to Saajan's office instead of her husband's. Although Saajan notices that something seems different about his lunch, he gives the matter little thought. He does, however, eat all of it, finding it quite delicious, and so when the lunchbox is returned to Ila that afternoon, she is surprised and delighted to find it completely empty, thinking that her husband must have enjoyed it for once. But when he comes home, he is just as cold and indifferent as ever, and only when she asks about it does he say anything, mentioning that the cauliflower was okay. Which tells her that something is amiss since the lunch she prepared didn't have any cauliflower. The next day, she prepares another lunch, this time sending it off with a note inside, telling whoever the lunch gets delivered to that he must've gotten the lunch she had prepared for her husband by mistake, but that she appreciated the fact that he had clearly enjoyed it, judging by the empty returns, and that it made her feel appreciated, if only for a little while. Reading the note, Saajan is hesitant at first, but afterwards sends back a note that that day's lunch was a bit salty. Which prompts Ila to fix something spicy for the next lunch - with a new note. Which prompts Saajan to send back a note about his having to eat a banana to dampen the heat in his mouth from the spice, mentioning off-handedly that he sees that so many people have nothing but a banana for their lunch. Gradually a correspondence between them builds as they share their observations, their thoughts and eventually their feelings, he about missing the life he had with his wife, she about the life she doesn't have with her husband.

There are a number of side-plots occurring in the film, foremost of which are Saajan's having to train an overly eager new-hire Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) as his replacement, Ila's having to deal with her father having terminal cancer and her mother's having to take care of him, and Auntie Deshpande's husband who's been in a coma for years. The real importance of these sub-plots is that through them we see how Saajan and Ila are both starting to see the world around them with new eyes, both of them coming alive again, their perspectives changing as a direct result of their chance correspondence. It is to writer/director Batra's immense credit that he imbues his film with a great deal of subtlety, little things like the sound of a particular song, the visual of a ceiling fan, the news of a random tragedy, each seen and reacted to by Saajan and Ila in their separate lives but making the point that they're both in the same world.

Another small but delightful detail is how Batra portrays Auntie Deshpande's character. You never actually see Ila's chatty upstairs neighbor though you hear her voice, hear her changing the music and looking through drawers for things. But you do see this basket she lowers to share cooking ingredients with Ila, and through the way Batra has the basket bob and weave, he gives the audience a visual feel for Auntie Deshpande's personality. I've never seen a dangling basket that manages to coax, tease, and nudge the way this one did in the film. An extraordinarily nice touch.

Important note: if you're not from India or familiar with the dabbawala system of lunchbox deliveries, I strongly suggest either googling it or looking it up on Wikipedia (from which I derived much of the following description) as it is important to fully understanding the film. It is also something of a fascinating subject in its own right. Started in Mumbai back in 1890, the dabbawala system is a complex, highly organized and remarkably reliable delivery system that collects hot food in lunch boxes (or ""dabbas"") from the residences of workers in the late morning, delivers the lunches to the workplace utilizing various modes of transport, predominantly bicycles and the railway trains, and returns the empty boxes back to the customer's residence that afternoon. They are also made use of by prominent meal suppliers in Mumbai where they ferry ready, cooked meals from central kitchens to the customers and back. The workers who handle the deliveries are ""dabbawalas"". What is also important to understand is that the chances of a lunchbox being delivered to the wrong place are on the order of once in every eight _million_ deliveries. Which is what makes the key event in ""The Lunchbox"" such a remarkable oddity.

In truth I only have two criticisms about the film. The first is strictly a technical one. Being an English speaker, I'm dependent on the sub-titles in films to follow what's going on, and I found that the choice of sub-title format in The Lunchbox often made them difficult to read, being very light text against what was frequently a light background. The other was what I felt was a loss of focus and pacing in the latter part of the film which made it a bit harder to follow what was going on and also felt less intimate than what came before it.

But that aside, The Lunchbox is truly something worth seeing, engaging you in a way that too few films ever do and prompting us to think about our own lives and about what really matters to us.

Highly recommended.",1406419200,16,6785,4.848144952545297

6195828,5,B00HPX33MM,"Brilliant delivery and performances. A simplistic story with complex implications and nuances.  Although Ila and Saafan lived in two different worlds in so many ways, ( She, a young neglected housewife and mother; He, a widowed accountant on the verge of retiring from his company) somehow through the magic of the lunchbox which was intended to be delivered to her husband at his work site, gets delivered to Saafan, by mistake, thereby their lives intersect. What really connects them is the food that she so lovingly and dotingly prepares and the series of notes that they begin to send back and forth. The lives of each of the characters reflects the defining line from the movie ""Sometimes the wrong train will get you to the right station.""  Each of them has something ""wrong"" in their lives, but eventually reach the right place in spite of the painful cost. This is a gentle, tender story against the backdrop of a culture that is still filled with ancient vestiges that co-exist in a modern world. The two characters are vulnerable and lonely, but stop just short of pursuing the passion and yearning that was just beneath the surface. We want them to fall in love, but know realistically that they are mismatched for each other.

6195851,5,B00HPX33MM,"Brace yourself. This gentle PG-rated drama has no gunshots, no car chases, no sweaty bodies and no blowie uppie stuff. It does, however, have several people to root for and a very clever premise.

An unappreciated wife prepares her husband's lunch each day but he never acknowledges the effort and planning she puts into it. One day, through some sort of clerical error, the lunch is delivered to a widower who thinks it is from the contractor who usually furnishes his meals. He eats every bite and she is gratified to see that her food is appreciated. Her husband however, says he liked the cauliflower, which wasn't in the lunch she sent.

We smile with:
  * Irrfan Kahn (""Life of Pi"") is the widower, soon to be retired, but delighted with the food that comes daily from the wrong cook! He wants to be left alone and has a deep fear of aging.
  * Nimrat Kaur (""Peddlers"") is the lovely but unappreciated wife, happy that her food is finally being enjoyed.
  *  Nawazuddin Siddiqui (""Liar's Dice"") is the ebullient (and VERY handsome) young man hired to replace our hero when he retires. His mother says, ""Sometimes the wrong train takes you to the right station.""
  * Nakul Vaid (""Stalker"") is that unappreciative husband. He has many things on his plate, but his wife's cooking is not one of them!

Mumbai's byzantine lunch-box delivery system is famous for its efficiency. (You have to see it to believe it!) When our heroine tells the deliveryman her lunches are going to the wrong person, he tells her the system was approved by Harvard and they cannot make mistakes.

The actors switch seamlessly between Hindi and English, so if you don't see any captions, they are probably speaking English. Amazon has shipped my DVD, so I should have captions for both languages. Hurrah!",1405900800,39,1783,4.731391585760518

6195859,5,B00HPX33MM,"THE LUNCHBOX: 2014; Written and directed by Ritesh Batra; starring Irrhan Khan (Slumdog Millionaire, Life of Pi) as Mr. Saajan Fernandes, an elder accountant about to retire; Nimrat Kaur (Peddlers) is Ila, the lonely housewife and mother; and Nawazuddin Siddiqui (Talaash, Kahaani) as Shaikh, an orphan and Fernandes new assistant. He quotes his mothers favorite expression: Sometimes the wrong train can bring you to the right station.

Mumbais Dabbawallah lunchbox system delivers home-cooked lunches to 250,000 workers each day averaging 1 mistake per 6,000,000 deliveries. Even Harvard is impressed. The films plot concerns that rare delivery gone wrong. But maybe its a miracle? The film introduces Ila, whose husbands teal green lunchbox is accidently delivered to Saajan Fernandes work desk. Saajan, a widower, is pleasantly surprised with the delicious meal since he was expecting an uninspired cauliflower lunch purchased from a restaurant. But on this auspicious day the sad-eyed taciturn Saajan finds metal tiffins are filled with a variety of spicy string beans, sauces, and homemade parathas. If love has a scent, it smells of curry, coconut, and fresh bread.

Ilas upstairs neighbor, the unseen Auntie Deshpande (voice by Bharati Ackrekar), lowers baskets of advice and spices to Ila via her open kitchen window. Later, when the dabbwalluh return the lunchbox, Ila is curious that the food is all gone, the tins wiped clean. Is this a sign that her husband appreciates her again? That night, when Rajeev (Nakul Vaid) returns home from work, he complains to his wife about the cauliflower lunch he ate. Now she knows that her meal went to someone else, and that person appreciated her cooking.

The plot thickens when a series of notes are exchanged between Ila and Saajan via the lunchbox. He writes her a note stating that the food was too salty. What? The next day he receives a very hotly spiced lunch. He sends her another note kindly stating that the salt was just right this time but he needed a banana to help settle his stomach. The humor and caring go back and forth between Saajan and Ila which is delightful and poignant. Unbeknownst to them, they are on journey of awakening their semi-comatose souls: Ila has a broken marriage, and Saajans wife has died but that does condemn them to live without happiness in the constrained world they feel caught in.

There are many little scenariostouches of magical-realismwhich reveal the coincidences that are drawing these people together: simultaneous fans spinning overhead or flies bothering them or a song sung by street children which is also heard coming from Aunties apartment. Meanwhile, the assistant, Shaikh, tries hard to please Saajan, eventually gaining some ground when he is asked to share Saajen s food. Until then Fernandes has treated Shaikh as an irritant. But Shaikh understands love; he knows how to create family since, as an orphan, hes had to. He has retained his sweetness for life and marvels at the incredible food Saajan gets to eat, food infused with such care.

In a touching scene, Fernandes, in a note to Ila, recounts a time when he was fixing his bike on his porch and looked through the living room window and saw his wifes face reflected in the TV while she laughed at a favorite show. He said he looked away but now wishes he hadnt.

The movie is close to perfect. Its directed with restraint and fine acting. Even the voice of Auntie, though shes never seen, is alive and full of character. Also good is Lillette Dubey (Best Marigold Hotel) as Illas financially strapped and depressed mother. Arrhan Khan is to Indian film what Henry Fonda or Paul Newman are to US film: all are consummate artists who get better and better at their craft as they age. The beautiful Nimrat Kaur is a marvel of subtlety, grace, and strength. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is all charm and control as he portrays a simple tender man striving to exceed societies low expectations of him. And Lillette Dubey is a national treasure and a fearless actor. Watching this movie is a master class in acting.

The Lunchbox is a slow-paced, intimate romance where less is more. It has a subtle heart-felt emotional path where the main characters evolve through a chance encounter via the rarest dabbwallah mistake. The magic-realism is not computer generated but rather seen in the facial expressions, the whirl of a fan, the need for fresh air, and the song of the dabbwallahs as they travel on the train home at night. Joy to us who strive beyond a boxed-in life: if you can smell it, and taste it, its sweetness can lead you to happiness. Or so I believe. This is an exceptional movie. Im trilled that India has opened its Bollywood doors to of movie of this caliber. Everyone will benefit. Go rent it. It might change your life.",1405641600,3,4799,4.895448954489545

Note: the majority of the dialogue is in Hindi; there are English subtitles.

The story is set in Mumbai, where an extraordinarily efficient daily lunch delivery service operates to send hot meals from people's homes to the workplaces of their loved ones.

The delivery service is the device that gets the story going. Through an unlikely error in the delivery of a lunchbox, two unlikely people meet and a relationship develops between them, as they write daily notes to each other- delivered through Mumbai's lunch delivery service.

We see their relationship develop at the same time as we are taken into the daily lives of the two main characters: one a widower contemplating retirement, the other the mother of a young child who is contemplating the future of her marriage. All this is set against the backdrop of bustling Mumbai.

The story sensitively explores their lives, while the sensitive direction, superb cinematography and nuanced performances from the excellent cast deliver a rewarding experience.

It may be a little slow for the average American audience but it's worth watching for people who enjoy subtle human interaction..  The two principle actors give impeccable performances.

One complaint I have is that the story is so heavily loaded with tragedies---the dead brother, ""Uncle"" in a coma, the orphan at work who can only afford bananas for lunch, the unfaithful husband, the father with cancer, the dead wife, the suicide of the young mother...Have I missed any?  Oh yes, the fact that the mother can't afford to pay for her husband's cancer medicine.  Fortunately  there's enough humor and warmth to keep it from being totally depressing..

6195900,2,B00HPX33MM,The interesting concept of finding human connection falls apart over the course of the movie since nothing significant happens.,1404691200,2,127,5.7368421052631575

6195907,1,B00HPX33MM,"This was sooooo slow and boring. I mean there were at least ten, maybe twenty, drawn out scenes of just looking at lunchboxes. Whether they be on the kitchen table, on a desk, in a cart, on a bike, in the hand, at the office, in a house or with a mouse! And throughout the whole movie I'm waiting for Auntie to fall out the window or just anything to kick-start this movie, but nope. The only thing that kept me awake was her screaming every ten minutes. Ah, but to have someone lower you food every now and again... not a bad idea. Oh, I almost forgot! There is the main storyline somewhere in there but if you blink, you'll miss it. Or fall asleep.",1404518400,4,650,4.166666666666667

6195909,5,B00HPX33MM,"Interesting story line and wonderful actors.  The movie was filmed in India and gives the audience a range of sights, sounds, customs, and food flavors.  The characters are interesting and well-developed.",1404432000,,204,5.548387096774194

6195912,3,B00HPX33MM,"Average, cool shots of India but story line weak and predictable.",1404432000,2,65,5.0
6195913,5,B00HPX33MM,"A truly heartwarming story of ""how the wrong train can take you to the right station.""  The food delivered in the lunch boxes is a character unto itself, and one that looks positively delicious (the aubergine dish especially).  Both central characters grow into more confident and happy people as they interact through their letters, sharing stories and dreams (and conveying messages with the food itself).  While their romance does evolve in a very sweet way, the more important storyline is how they each become stronger people, at peace and ready to take on the world in a new way.  Seeing the workings of the incredible lunchbox delivery system is another highlight of the film.",1404259200,,683,4.964912280701754
6195914,5,B00HPX33MM,"The Lunchbox is an excellent film. For people interested in the strains of modern life. For people who love great camera work (Kurosawa, Ozu). For people who love great acting. For foodies. For people who are obsessed with cities. For Mumbai-wallahs and wannabe Mumbai-wallahs. No Bollywood numbers, no elaborate costumes, no shirtless hunks or wet sari scenes. No Slumdog melodrama. Just an excellent film. Bahut acha hai.",1404172800,2,423,5.3283582089552235
