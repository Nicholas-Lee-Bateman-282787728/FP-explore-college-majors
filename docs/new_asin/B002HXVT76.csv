8414542,5,B002HXVT76,"Donny Gruendler: Creating & Performing Drum Loops short review. I'm a teacher and love the way Donny has presented his concepts on this DVD. Technology is always evolving(softwares,equipments), but the principles and tips Donny shares with us will last forever. You just need to keep up to date with technology. If you are an advanced drummer pay close attention to the ""Playing on, behind and ahead of the beat"" section. You will love it. I highly recommend Donny Gruendler's Creating & Performing Drum Loops.",1391558400,,510,5.083333333333333
8414543,5,B002HXVT76,"is an honor tu be the first to give my review on this fine product but let's begin.
first i had the experience of having mr. gruendler as a teacher and believe he really nail all of the useful concepts that he teaches at musicians institute in this dvd.
this will set you appart of all the nonsense chops dvds that saturate the market today, and give you a great insight integrating drum loops and backing tracks to your musical suitcase.
he begins by explaning the crucial concepts behind the drum loops and the comtemporary aplication of them.
but what i found very and i mean very useful is the live triggering and acoustic drum triggering sections.
and the complemantary demo versions of live 7 and bfd2 are just great.
be sure to read the midi premier before getting yourself involve in the dvd so you can understand everything.
my final words are that this dvd is an eyeopener for all the drummers that want crazy independence and superhuman chops, this is the modern alternative for a new genarations of drummers
thanks alot donny for sharing this info with the drumming comunity.
and be sure to check out his book working with loops too.
