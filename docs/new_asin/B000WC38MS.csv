2964288,2,B000WC38MS,"Ditto what I said in my review of ""Best of Bravestarr.""
Great release for fans of the series.
I just thought it was one of the worst shows produced by the best animation company of all time.
I hanker for more of Filmation's 1970s and 1960s shows (especially those controlled by Warner Bros and Paramount & Edgar Rice Burroughs executors, such as Superman, Batman, Brady Kids and Tarzan respectively).",1204675200,,400,4.811594202898551
2964289,5,B000WC38MS,"I missed this show as a kid. It came out when I was probably a senior in high school and would have been off my radar at that point, though I was a child of the 80's Golden Age of Animation (He-Man, Thundercats, Voltron, etc.).  Anyway, boy did I miss out on something.  I picked this up because the themes intrigued me, and the reviews I read seemed to indicate it might be up my alley.  I will not go into all the detail others have, but felt I needed to tell folks that if they are a fan of the He-Man/Thundercats era of animation, then this is something you have to own.  Not only is it apparently an important piece of animation history (being the last American animation project of any real size), but it is a body of work that stands the test of time.  Watching a show like the original He-Man has nostalgic value to someone my age, but those episodes do contain a certain amount of cringe-value, and I don't know if my kids will enjoy them as much as I did for as long as I did (though I sincerely hope they will).  But Bravestar really lacks that dated, this-would-never-fly-today feel that you get from some of the vintage animation those of us who grew up in the 80's have such a soft spot for.  Good stuff.  Has the main character giving the viewer the moral for the day as He-Man used to--which is something you just can't picture a show doing anymore, but also can't figure out why the heck not.  Great production values, great transfer.  Great extras.  Really a pleasure to view and I am really glad I rolled the dice on it.  If you want the feature movie that kicked this series off, you need to get the Best of Bravestar DVD release.  It's worth owning as well, and the extra episodes it brings with it are just a bonus, especially at the price it's going for now (like 12 bucks).  All the Bravestar products are highly recommended.  I really hope the second volume actually comes out and I will definitely be picking that one up, too.  So should you!",1198800000,9,1968,4.307065217391305

2964293,4,B000WC38MS,"I'm 33 years old now, but I can still remember the greatest cartoon decade ever, the 1980s, so fondly. Now with many of the cartoons being released on DVD, reliving those fun days isn't so far away anymore. Bravestarr was one of those toons I really enjoyed watching because it was a wicked mix of sci-fi and western style, turning it into an animated ""Westworld,"" only without Yul Brenner going out of control. Having a Native American-style character in the lead was impressive, always referring back to its culture, even if the action took place on a whole other planet. The character mix couldn't have been more diverse, especially with characters like Thirty-Thirty, Fuzz, J.B., Shaman, and a whole bunch of others. Looking at them all made it such a pleasure to watch.

Now, it's possible Thirty-Thirty's gun Sarah Jane and Skuzz's cigar-smoking may be a bit bothersome for some, which by today's standards is completely understandable. However, go on and have fun watching the marshall and his friends maintaining law and order on New Texas!

Edit: I'm thrilled to see my all-time favorite (and the series' only two-part) episode: ""Sherlock Holmes in the 23rd Century""! I made the earlier mistake of saying it would be in the 2nd half of the series.",1195862400,7,1256,4.892018779342723
2964294,4,B000WC38MS,"Bravestarr is the end of a long line of great cartoons from Filmation studios, and this also ended the era of television animation done completely by Americans (today, animation is outsourced).  In 1987, following Ghostbusters, Filmation created Bravestarr and sold the rights to Mattel, who then made the toyline which had special electronic guns (which are often shown during combat scenes).

Bravestarr is a hybrid of two common television themes, half science fiction and half western.  The main character, Marshall Bravestarr (a native American) is the primary law enforcer on a planet called New Texas.  New Texas has a valuable mineral called Kerium, which yields a great deal of energy when destroyed, but emits a gas that causes hallucinations if the Kerium is partially damaged.  To help Bravestarr, his primary sidekick is a robot horse (Equestroid) named 30-30 and Bravestarr has a prairie humanoid deputy named Fuzz.  In addition to 30-30 and Fuzz, there are a number of other characters, with a local female Judge who goes by the initials JB (a romantic interest is hinted at, but not really explored on the TV series), a bartender named Handlebar and finally a mentor and spiritual protector to Marshall Bravestarr known as Shaman (an older more traditional looking native American).

Predictably, Bravestarr is good versus evil.  Bravestarr's criminal roster includes Tex Hex (the main nemesis), Outlaw Skuzz (the opposite of Deputy Fuzz), and several other villains.  Tex Hex answers to a powerful spirit named Stampede, who is the rough equivalent to Shaman.

The transfer quality is good, although there are visual artifacts here and there, and the audio is nearly flawless for a monaural soundtrack.  The 4 DVD's include the first 33 episodes and includes interviews with Lou Schiemer, Pat Fraley (voice of Bravestarr), and two directors.  On disc 4, Filmation apparently did an experimental show that would have followed as a spinoff to Bravestarr called ""The quest of the prairie people"", although the spinoff does not feature any of the main Bravestarr characters.

The DVD packaging is of good quality-two discs per side, stacked in a way I haven't seen before (one DVD tray on top of the other, which fold out), and while it doesn't have an embossed package like in He-Man, it is easy to tell that a lot of effort was made here.

Unlike most all other Filmation shows, this show doesn't rely so much on stock footage (for example, there are no shots of anyone laughing based on the original Tarzan Lord Of The Jungle stock animation).  While the show was targeted towards children, adults can still enjoy the show as the plots aren't really ""dumbed down.""  Filmation studios has no problem saying the ""K"" word unlike most other animation studios, past and present.  ""K"" meaning kill, of course.

""The Legend Of Bravestarr"", which is not included, explains background information on all the characters.

If you like Filmation cartoons, this is a good final effort from them, and I wanted to see all of the episodes I missed when it was broadcast long, long ago.  I'm giving the boxed set a ""4"" because on disc 3, many of the episodes have a full stereo musical soundtrack.  If this had been a minimal release (all mono-soundtrack, no DVD extras at all), the show by itself is pretty average-closer to a ""3"" in Amazon's rating system.  Sherlock Holmes in the 23rd century started out very interesting, but by the second half of the episode I didn't think too highly of it.  Anyway, a big thanks to BCI Eclipse for treating Bravestarr respectfully in Filmation's afterlife!

Because this is a hybrid western/science-fiction show, it has aged pretty well.  As far as the stories go, they are average in quality but I still personally like Flash Gordon and Tarzan Lord Of The Jungle (unreleased) better.

Note-for some reason, on my Lou Scheimer interview, halfway through the audio completely cuts out.",1195603200,15,5139,5.232926829268293

It's shocking how hard it is to find The bravestarr cartoon But THANK GOD for AMAZON!
I just can't believe how under rated this cartoon is.
None of my friends have heard of it neither has my girlfriend And since i'm the first to write a review which by the way is my first time writing a review.
For as popular as this cartoon was back then it gets no respect today.
But if you are reading this in my mind And i'm sure in the minds of people who love cartoon Animation This cartoon may not thrive but IT WILL NEVER DIE!

This has the feel of He Man but with the Texas Western style.

Here is a list also of how characters are similar.

Bravestarr:  He-Man but without the magic sword
Tex-Hex:  Skeletor
Judge J.B  Teela
Thirty-thirty: Gringer/Battlecat
Sandstone:  Kobra Kong
Vipra:  Evilyn
Thunderstick: Trapjaw
Shawman:  Sorcereress

you kinda get the idea.
I didn't get to see this show very much due to limited recording devices at that time (NO DVR) and limited cable channels back when cable TV was just starting to come around in rural areas.
