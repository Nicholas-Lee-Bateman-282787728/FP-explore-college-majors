7803749,5,6300136523,"DVD is impossible to find. This flick has everything to enjoy--good actors, conflicts, reality, imagination, connections between public and private, some nudity--everything except you cannot buy it in DVD. But sure I make DVD myself and the heck with it.
Excellent music makes impression Italians understand music better than anybody and as a piece of Italian history this movie one of my favored in huge collection I accumulated.
Multiple layers of private lives manage to fit perfectly, people behave as we see them in real life, gee--Italian movies are the best.",1346803200,5,565,5.21978021978022
7803750,5,6300136523,"I saw Wifemistress in its cinematic release years ago, and I still remember the wit, acting, beautiful cinematography, and evocative musical soundtrack of this ensemble film featuring Mastroianni and Antonelli at the peaks of their craft.  The film is romantic, amusing, and engaging, and makes for a wonderful evening watching it with one's significant other.  This film begs for restoration and re-release in its complete European release version on Blu-ray by Criterion.",1294358400,9,473,5.555555555555555

7803753,4,6300136523,"It's almost 30 years now that I have seen this film in its original italian version. What a great movie! One of the strongest depictions of passion I have seen on the screen! As for the actors,those of you who appreciate european cinema will have the opportunity to watch a great Mastrogianni and a formidable Antonelli,an actress I realised I'm still in love with besides the many years I had to see one of her films. Now, let me comment on the VHS I bought. The quality was fine. I couldn't expect more!..Still, the english version has been cut here and there as if it was heading for distribution in Saudi Arabia! This is the only great minus of the video that I noticed with utter frustration. Besides, the story is stil comprahensible and realy worth seeing.",1076112000,14,763,4.576642335766423
