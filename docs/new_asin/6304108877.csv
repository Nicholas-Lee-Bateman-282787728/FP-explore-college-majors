791043,5,6304108877,"Having actually worked on this film, I decided to have a look more than 10 years later, only to find it just as entertaining and clever!  Excellent performances, taut editing, and slick Mamet dialogue, (along with some  twists and turns!) help make this one of the coolest flicks of all  time.
It's no wonder that Roger Ebert called it the BEST FILM OF THE  YEAR.
Be sure to give it a look.
PS - Chic, I miss all the fun we had  working together, hope all is well with you!

791044,5,6304108877,"The beauty of David Mamet's superb ""House of Games"" is that it keeps you guessing, right up until the end.  The film is about con men, but it is Mamet's screenplay that pulls the real con, getting viewer thinking  it is headed in one direction and then veering off somewhere else.  This is  what ""The Sting"" might have been like had it not been a comedy.  The real strength of the film is in the performances, particularly the  leads Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna.  The supporting cast are all from  Mamet's theatrical company and they don't so much perform their roles as  they inhabit them.  Overall, this film proves that David Mamet is as good a  film director as he is a playwrite.",963964800,4,688,4.512195121951219
791045,5,6304108877,"Worth it just for seeing Ricky Jay's film debut. He's the cleverest magician out there, putting the likes of the overblown David Copperfield to shame. This is a subtly acted and directed film, worthy of multiple  viewings. There is so much going on and there are so many layers of  metaphor, it's a veritable chinese puzzle. There are very few movies, or  books for that matter, that reward repeated exposure. This is one that  does. Joe Mantegana, who might as well be labeled a protege of Mamet's,  delivers his most complex and fully realized characterization to date. His  timing is perfectly in tune with Mamet's cadences, which become  spellbinding. Crouse is understandably confused, but by no means  unintelligent or unaware, which makes for a complex interpretation. She  buys into the con, but holds onto her integrity in the process. This is one  of those films where the audience, if they are paying attention, shift  allegiances about fifteen times. The nearest approximation in Cinema  history is ""Diobolique,"" starring Simone Signoret (remade as  ""Games""). Like that great film, the audience doesn't have any  idea who to side with until the end, and even then we are left with  questions. This is a great film for anyone interested in the intricacies of  con games, the cinema directorial debut of an important American  playwright, or anyone else who just enjoys grand entertainment.",963532800,8,1400,5.0701754385964914
791046,5,6304108877,"Whenever you watch a Mamet film, you're in for the most subtle mind manipulation you're likely to get at the movies. Mamet is so skillful at his craft it's scary. 'House Of Games' is the quintessential Mamet film,  not because it's the best, but because it has all his elements; a twisting  and involving plot, perversely attractive characters and a big wallop of an  ending, as expected by the master of manipulation. The film is admirable  because of it's subtlety, it has no big noisy scenes, no real action scenes  and no steamy romantic scenes, Mamet could of easily added one of each but  that would of marred the effect of this expertly crafted film. The dialogue  is right on the money, Mantegna talks just as a small-time grifter would  talk, no one-liners or really smart conversation, just a low-key dose of  reality. Lindsay Crouse if quietly effective as the thrill-seeking  pyschiatrist who gets the experience of a lifetime. And Mantegna is  perfection as the alluring con-man who does his job fatally well. An  extremely well mounted film that leaves the intelligent viewer gasping.  Extras: spot William H. Macy in a cameo. From a scale of 1-10 I give this  film a 9!",963187200,31,1184,4.768472906403941
791047,5,6304108877,"David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debutwith ""House of Games,"" a character study fraught withpsychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into thedark world of the confidence game.  Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel, ""Driven."" Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability.  When a patient, Billy Hahn (Steven Goldstein), confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf.  This takes her to the ""House of Games,"" a seedy little dive where she meets Mike (Joe Mantegna), a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world.  Instead of the ""twenty-five large"" that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars.  And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she'll agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room.  In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the ""tell"" of one of the other players. By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. The dialogue, and Mamet's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing.  As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her.  From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a ""tell"" is and how it works, to the lessons of the ""short con,"" to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless.  And nothing is what it seems.  In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself.  She changes; and whether or not it's for the better is open to speculation.  Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does.  Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, self-assured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated.  She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well.  The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum (Joey), Lilia Skala (Dr. Littauer), J.T. Walsh (The Businessman), Ricky Jay (George) and William H. Macy (Sergeant Moran). ""House of Games"" is the quintessential Mamet; he's written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future.  But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. You'll find it under ""Perfection."" This is one great movie you do not want to miss.",959472000,12,3150,4.720802919708029
791048,5,6304108877,"This movie is probably David Mamet's best, although ""The Spanish Prisoner"" comes in at a close second. While the acting is superb, Mamet's direction gets all credit here, keeping the viewer on the edge and  never ceasing to amaze us with a new twist. I never get tired of watching  this movie.",949968000,,293,4.615384615384615
791049,4,6304108877,"Maybe we've just become too clever since this movie was made, but most of the twists and turns are predictable. Ten years ago, I think more people would have been fooled.
A bigger problem with the film, though, is that  the actors don't seem to mesh with their dialog. This is especially true of  Linday Crouse, who can't get in synch with the screenplay, and I think her  mistakes detract from/obscure Mantegna's job. (Come to think of it, she's  sort of like this in Buffy, too...)
Mamet films -- even the ones he  didn't direct -- have a particular flow and tone to them, but the actors  louse this one up a little. I think this was Mamet's directorial debut, so  maybe that contributed to it. By the time Spanish Prisoner came along,  everybody knew what it meant to act in a Mamet film, and so that movie  flows a lot better than this one.
On the upside, several of the  supporting performances are great, and there are many familiar faces (look  out for William H. Macy, who shows up for about 10 seconds).
All in all,  it's worth seeing, and is obviously essential for Mamet fans, but I liked  the Spanish Prisoner more.",943574400,8,1127,4.465686274509804

791164,4,6304108877,"A while back in reviewing the first film of the Ocean trilogy (you know 11, 12, 13 and then they ran out of legitimate cons and so mercifully closed down the film caper) I noted something that I believe applies in duplicate to the film under review David Manets The House Of Games. Here is what I said there:

Lets face it everybody loves a con, loves a con artist at least since old Herman Melville made a big literary deal out of such characters in his 19th century novel The Confidence Man . Well everybody loves a con, a con artist as long as that personage is conning somebody else and not ones good self. Better if the con is on some super-rich guy who made his dough by walking over a pile of people, hell, maybe a pile of corpses. And that latter premise is what makes George Clooneys remake of the 1960s Frank Sinatra-led classic con story Oceans Eleven go the distance.

Well we have no superrich personage here but rather a best-selling psychiatrist who specializes in addictions, Doctor Margaret Ford played by Lindsay Crouse, and we have a con that beats whatever Danny and Rusty in Oceans could come up with-almost.

Heres the skinny. One of the good Doctors clients had a gambling addiction and was ready to commit suicide over the huge deal he owns to a gambler, Mike, played by Joe Mantegna, but she is able to dissuade him from that drastic action. She in turn goes to Mike to try to persuade him to forget the debt. To rope her in he makes a deal with her to play his girlfriend while playing poker against a Las Vegas big wheel. Her role is to see what quirk belies his hand. When the gambling gets going Margaret noticed the tell-tale jerk of his ring that Mike had been looking for which told him the other guy was bluffing. Mike made bets based on that quirk. And lost, lost big. Trouble was he was betting on credit. No go. The Vegas wheel wanted his dough and produced a gun. Margaret feeling responsible agreed to write a check for the money owed. Beautiful, almost. She noticed that the gun was a water pistol. No sale but she was hooked even though she was to be the victim.

Her own life is a drag despite her latest best-selling so she gravitates toward Mike and his very upfront con artist ways. Gravitates to his bed as well. The next caper is a beauty. The found money gag which has been around since Adam and Eve and the serpent gag, maybe before. She wants in on the caper at least to see the play. Mike, his roper, and the mark find a suitcase with eighty thousand big ones in it. They squabble over what to do with it but it winds up that the mark is going to take custody of the dough until the split by giving Mike a check for thirty thou (no way they were returning the dough). Like finding money, finding a real thirty thou on the ground. Except the mark is a cop pulling a sting operation. Mike had to kill the cop in a melee and the three have to flee with Mike implicating Margaret in the scheme to get away. Oops, they lose the suitcase with the dough in it in the rush to get away. The dough had been borrowed by the mob-ouch. Then Margaret offered to pay the lost dough. Bingo. Eighty large and no heavy lifting. Almost.

See something wasn't right when Margaret saw that client of hers at Mikes hang-out and so she slipped in and overheard how they had, Mike, the client, the dead cop and the roper, pulled this bigger caper on her. Well she had played with fire so she should have expected to get burned. She had a better idea though. Pretending she thought they were still on the lam she told Mike that she had been freaked out by the caper and had taken all her money out of the bank and they should go away together. That dough was catnip to Mike but in a final confrontation once Mike knew she knew about the scam that had been pulled on her she wanted him to repent. No go. A con is a con and that was that. She killed Mike on the spot without remorse. Sorry.

Like I said everybody likes a con as long as it is not directed against them. Ask Mike if you don't believe me.",1484956800,,4026,4.242503259452412

Yet the film watches quick; the dialogue is all about making contact and moving the action. The delivery is artificially clever and dramatic.

791277,4,6304108877,"Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) is a celebrated psychiatrist who, at the beginning of the film, we learn has just published a bestselling self-help book. However, she is not as good a therapist as she is a writer. She interrogates her patients with subtle intimidation which causes them to pull away from her well-intended treatment. One of her patients comes to his appointment and claims an underground speak-easy of gamblers are out to get him because he owes a large gambling debt. Her patient tells her she must speak with ""Mike"", and Ford decides to take investigate.

She wanders into a shady bar with a gambling room at the back. There she finds Mike (Joe Mantegna), an amiable and well-dressed man who happens to engage in gambling. Turns out her patient's gambling debt is not as high as he had said. Mike makes the psychiatrist a deal: if she'll help him out in a current poker game, he'll forgive the debt. She agrees, and thus becomes enraptured with this cutting edge world of gamblers and grifters. She learns Mike is a grifter, a con artist who uses deception and cunning against marks who willingly give him money.

Dr. Ford, bored with her position as a psychiatrist at a local medical institution, decides she'll devote more of her time to writing. Her subject: gamblers and grifters who live on the periphery of mainstream society. She insists Mike teach her everything about con games. Not just gambling games, but the games he plays to extract cash out of unsuspecting victims, many of whom don't realize they are being conned.

David Mamet's foray into the world of grifters is one of the better offerings of its type. Similar fair include ""The Sting"", ""The Film-Flam Man"" and ""The Grifters"". Mantegna in particular makes the perfect con artist, whose charm and likability pull in marks from all social strata. In an interesting scene, Mantegna demonstrates why the ""con"" of ""con man"" means confidence in which the grifter gives his confidence to the mark. He compels a young soldier-in-training (William Macy) into giving a sizable amount of cash to a complete stranger at a Western Union office. A well-done and thoroughly entertaining film.",1437609600,,2169,4.9046321525885554
791278,4,6304108877,"House of Games is truly a treatfrom the acting to the musicand reminds you why great movies are so enjoyable. In the film, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) is a successful psychiatrist and author, who finds herself concerned for a suicidal patient with a large gambling debt. This worry leads her to the shady underground world of gaming, where she meets Mike, a con man, to whom she becomes immediately attracted. Mike (Joe Mantegna) proceeds to teach Margaret the art of conning and she accepts the instruction with alacrity. Eventually, however, you begin to ask yourself who is duping whom as the movie progresses. This is precisely why House of Games is so entertaining, because just when you think you have figured it out, there is a new twist that causes you to reevaluate everything. Watching this movie is not a passive experience, it is an active one.

The character of Dr. Margaret Ford is fascinating, because just like real life, very successful people are often attracted to danger, as its an escape from the tedium of everyday life. Margaret is a sophisticated, fastidious, and urbane woman, who lives alone, constantly smokes Camel Lights and genuinely cares for the welfare of her patients. One woman whom she helps is a prison ward patient, presumably guilty of murder. During an exchange with her mentor regarding this patient, Ford laments: Why do we listen to their troubles when we cant help them [] its a con. Margaret sees how much of life is a con, a game, a fraud, a performance, an act. This is why she is so attracted to Mike, who seems to be honest about being a cheat. By the end of the movie, however, Margaret has gone beyond just fraud, and does something that surprised me. Due to this action, she has to take her mentors memorable piece of advice for life: When youve done something thats unforgivable, you have to forgive yourself.

Like Woody Allen, director David Mamet is an American treasure, and watching his work is such a delight. In this movie the viewer is challenged rather than condescended to. Crouse and Mantegna are superb in this film, and the late great J.T. Walsh nails his role perfectly. House of Games is a captivating neo-noir Hitchcockian thriller that entertains you, and youll remember this movie for a long time.",1437350400,,2275,4.786259541984733

Discussion: Whats more fun than human nature? Mike snarls cynically. And what makes for better drama than the very same? Mike and Margaret are two sides of one coin: Shes got intelligence and training; hes got experience and street savvy. Shes mesmerized by his skill and hooked on the gut-level thrills he provides, spicing her immaculately ordered but essentially empty life. He admires her for her guts and sharp eye. But in a movie that openly revels in its multiple levels of deception, can we really expect anything to be what it appears? And when you pit two experts in psychological motivation against one another, the only real bottom line lies in separating the personal from the professionaland hell hath no fury like a woman scammed.

Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Mamets directorial debut is impressive, and his script even more so; its sleight of hand that is anything but slighta gripping film worthy of superlatives. There is real intelligence here; real power and emotional intensity; real suspense and real surprise; real danger and real drama.

Oscar-winning actor Martin Landau, who teaches acting on the side, once told an interviewer words to the effect that acting is not about showing emotion; its about showing people struggling to *prevent* themselves from showing emotion. Crouses performance is a classic example of this school; her subtle portrayal of an overly-controlled obsessive compulsive slowly succumbing to her own most deeply suppressed desires is itself a masterpiece of self-control. And Mantegna deserved an Oscar for his bitter, obnoxious, edgy Mike. Neither actor has ever given a better performanceor performed in a better script.

The surface story, punctuated by Mamets trademark precise dialog, gives us a fascinating insight into the age-old con game, revealing such insider secrets as the tell, and providing us with a crash course in how to set up and pull off a short con or a big sting. But the film is much more than just a modern noir. One layer beneath this veneer is a Jungian animus fantasy: Margaret secretly yearns for a shadowy, mysterious, fascinating stranger to subdue and possess her; when she finds him, she is drawn deeply into the dark side of her own nature.

In addition to the satisfying twists and turns of the plot, the film is grounded in the psychology of its characters. To play the confidence game requires confidence: in ones knowledge, skills, perceptions and desiresand particularly in ones self. House of Games moves beyond mere mind games to raise unsettling questions about Big Issues like ethics and self-interest, right and wrong and good and evil, sanity and acceptance, and ultimately, of life and death.",1423180800,,3964,4.971342383107089

791699,5,6304108877,"This has now becomes my favorite film by director David Mamet. This clever, psychological thriller is about a successful psychiatrist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford, (Lindsay Crouse). She lives her life in a very clearly defined way, often getting vicarious thrills through her troubled patients. When one of her patients is in trouble with a loan shark Margaret decides to help him out. This decision leads her into the dangerous but exciting world of the hustle and into the arms of the seductive, king of scam, Mike, (Joe Mantegna). Mike teases Margaret into exploring his world and Margaret, for the first time in her life, lets go of her conventional, boring world of black & white, right vs. wrong and enters a world where she is never sure where one hustle ends and the next one begins. This cleverly written screenplay, also by Mamet, brings the audience into the seedy life of the grifters and teaches us a lesson or two about the life of con men.

791750,5,6304108877,"This is the first film directed by Pulitzer Prize playwright David Mamet.  His wife, Lindsey Crouse, has the lead role as psychiatrist Margaret Ford.  A patient with a gambling addiction tells her he has amassed a huge debt he can't pay back--except with his life.  Dr. Ford goes to the House of Games in an effort to get her patient's debt excused.  Like the proverbial moth to flame, she is attracted to this world of con men and their elaborate psychological games.  Every trick they reveal to her has another behind it.  All this is made more intriguing due to the sexual attraction developing between Dr. Ford and Mike, the chief con man, played by Joe Montegna.
  The dialogue often has a clipped staccato rhythm that adds to the treacherous. threatening, urgent,seedy atmosphere.  Mamet as film director follows his philosophy of acting in the theater. He does not want ""acting"" and keeps emotion to a bare necessity, for the most part just saying the lines naturally, sincerely, is all he requires.  The result is a certain coldness that adds to the less than friendly atmosphere.
  There are lots of twists and turns in this movie but they are actually purposeful and believable.  Too often, contemporary movies jerk us around with  arbitrary twists that leave the viewer alienated from the story.  In House of Games we still care.

And to top it off, you are afforded some laughters with the real display of great creative thinking.",1311897600,,410,4.269230769230769
791753,5,6304108877,"The superficial message of the movie -- the mental patient saying to the psychiatrist, ""Do you think you're exempt from real life?"" and the scamming of the psychiatrist which proves that she is not exempt -- is meant to distract us from the deeper themes.

The subtle truth of the entire movie is that the doctor herself is a bad person. Mike, in dying, correctly says to her, ""You're a bad pony, and I'm not going to bet on you."" Her interest in her patients, her compulsivity, conceal a selfish, infantile, ultimately homicidal personality which causes her to steal Mike's knife and to steal the woman's lighter in the restaurant at the end of the movie.

The second subtle truth is that Billy's initial visit to her as a compulsive gambler in trouble with the mob is already part of the scam. The con men heard about her success and set out to scam her.

Her parapraxes, ""The only pressures in my life,"" meaning, ""the only pleasures in my life,"" are a perhaps clumsy device on the part of Mamet to set up the final damning parapraxis, ""I took your knife"" instead of ""I took the knife from the hotel.""

Her desire for the thrill of joining Mike in the scam at the hotel, culminating in her theft of the knife, illustrates her pathology. Underneath her civilized veneer she is a thief, a criminal, a narcissist. (Fans of Mamet will note that in HOMICIDE Detective Bobby Gold commits the identical departure from his professional obligations in joining the radical Jews in blowing up an anti-semitic propaganda shop. Gold's professional obligation -- ""I took an oath"" - is superseded by his personal weaknesses. Mamet can't make the movies without his heroes at some point behaving out of character.)

One thing you notice if you've seen the movie many times as I have, is that when the suave con man suddenly becomes vulnerable and beseeching - ""I'm terribly embarrassed, but I have to ask you to lend me this money"" -- the experienced psychiatrist should smell a rat, should see a crack in his performance. But without this naivet on her part, we wouldn't have the finale in which she kills Mantegna for scamming her and symbolically raping her. The device has to be used, even though it strikes a faintly false note throughout.

The same goes for the eavesdropping by which she finds out the whole thing was a scam. Eavesdropping is in itself a clumsy device, but it has a venerable history in theater, film and literature. Marcel Proust used eavesdropping throughout REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST to allow us to see the side of a character that has not been seen before. The first instance is when Billy comes to her office after the purported murder and she sees him driving away in the red Cadillac that was part of the scam. This leads directly to her eavesdropping on the crooks blithely talking about her foolishness and expressing reluctant admiration for her badness in stealing the knife. From this scene we go directly to the airport where she kills Mike.

The final irony is that the experienced con man is murdered by his victim. He chose the wrong mark, he made an error in his professional judgment, and ends up with six bullets from Billy's gun in his dead body.

But he wasn't killed as an act of justice. He was killed by a criminal who, in the next scene, steals a lighter from the purse of the woman sitting at the next table in the restaurant.

The movie is a reflection on badness, the badness in all of us, which can be found in places where it is not expected to be, such as the psyche of a therapist.

I have always thought David Mamet was limited by being a bit less clever than he thinks he is. And indeed, if you're looking closely enough, the cracks are there, the flaws in structure and motivation.

But his best movies are intriguing to watch for the weaknesses of the characters and the director.",1307145600,5,3827,4.588579795021962

It's all talk...you do nothing""(says Billy,the victim of a debt who seeks her help).That is the challenge he sets up to induct her and us into a world of vicarious pleasure,a life of crime that is a series of ingenious games,until the realisation that he/she was the victim of a master game that reached back to the beginning of the film. Small cons lead onto a bigger con,cons operate within cons,language is like the guage with its pauses and repetitions and cadences,polished from Mamet's theatrical world,featuring players he brings with him as a company and family(including ex-wife Lindsay Cruise),who are all tried and tested deliverers of Mamet's crafted dialogue. Within a situation that is carefully prepared,where the environment,the `script'and the required behaviour are very familiar to the players, something is undertaken involving risk and challenge,the unexpected and the unpredictable,so the person(heroine,audience)for whose benefit it is all being staged will be tempted to participate,will be drawn in.

That House of Games,Mamet's 1st film,works in film terms,smoothly dovetailing theatrical-rhetorical and cinematic-minimal. This is a psychological drama as well as a scam:human curiousity,greed and vanity are the counters in a game in which control is achieved through fantasy. Margaret Ford has written a best-selling book,Driven,a study of compulsive behaviour,she is a successful practitioner,she has a mentor to whom she confesses what she does is a `con game',she can't help people,she makes a Freudian slip about her father telling a murderess(she's seeing in prison)she's a whore. Her mentor tells her to relax,enjoy herself. She says she enjoys writing her book. She keeps a notebook:'""Help me-no one will help me.""`The character Mike,the unbeatable gambler-seen as omniscient,who doles out punishment.'Turning a page:`The House of Games  211 Beaumont Street'
`The necessity to find a place to be humiliated-a place you can go back to again and again. He romanticises the scene...soft lighting...'This may all be part of a novel she is writing.

We cut to a night scene in the House of Games. Mike(Mantegna) is the charismatic hustler and practitioner of the card-sharping House of Games. She has come to ask him to stop threatening Billy and finds the debt is $800 not $25,000. She can cancel the debt if she does Mike a `favour'.He informs her what a `tell' is,then proceeds via a poker game to draw her into his world. She is conned into thinking she has seen through their con to get her $6000. They say ""It's only business,it's the American way"".This becomes the guarded,deadpan mode in which their courtship is played out-a double seduction in which Mike offers the kind of danger and excitement Margeret has only known at second-hand through her work,and by his demonstration of the psychological clues and ploys in gamesmanship which pique her as a professional in the field.

Mike tells her ""to trust no one"".She asks him if he'd engage with her in a study of the confidence game. He says ""you want to see how a true bad man plies his trade?""He describes why it's a confidence game,""because you give me your confidence?No,because I give you mine.""He demonstrates how to get money when you have none:he gives William H.Macey his"" confidence,I ask him for help,what he gets is he feels he's a good man.""He thinks she gets something from this transaction:she ""wants somebody to come along and possess her. To take you into a new thing.""The con artist maintains control,until the repressed,morbidly fascinated doctor flips out,asserting
control in the only way available to a woman scorned. Or does she?The last piece of Mamet's puzzle might be the possibility that this all takes place in the heroine's mind,while she plays doctor to herself. Remember the notebook,before she goes to the House of Games,the Freudian slips,is Mike the father she has killed?Is her mentor her doctor?As for empathy...",1275091200,4,4294,5.273391812865497
791777,5,6304108877,I have seen David Mamet's House of Games many times on cable since it was released in 1987. It looks great in the recent Criterion release and the special features give further insight into the human psychology which lies behind the film. This is a deep movie which rewards repeated viewing.,1274486400,2,291,4.7254901960784315
791778,4,6304108877,"A psychologist (Lindsay Crouse) becomes seduced by the shadowy world of con artists when she meets a charismatic grifter (Joe Mantegna) who recognizes the almost sexual charge she gets from transgressive behavior.

David Mamet's film holds easily holds its own against the plot twists of classic con films such as ""The Sting"" and ""Nine Queens.""  However, he does them one better by extending the arena of duplicity and doubt into the subtle, murky depths of character motivations so that the surface maneuverings of a confidence game pale beside their psychological implications.  I enjoyed this film for the richly detailed portrayal of its world, filled with the nuts and bolts of running a con, but I was also fascinated by its bleak, nuanced take on human nature.",1272844800,2,767,5.071428571428571
791779,5,6304108877,"Very 'Precise', if said in one word. In this film you will witness day to day life characters, the plot is simplified but its not just about a psychiatrist getting acquainted with a gambler, its much more deeper than that. Joe Mantegna is simply brilliant, succeeds in playing the role of a gambler to perfection, he is very precise and shines with flamboyancy throughout the film. Lindsay Crouse is excellent and her chemistry with Mantegna is so strong and deep, you can't help but glue your eyes to the pair, every single dialogue, every single action or even a movement grabs your attention. The film gets dark slowly, situations slowly get unpredictable and then you start wondering whom to trust and whom not to. The film is wroth watching many times, its totally a joy ride.",1268352000,4,781,4.75
791780,5,6304108877,"Too often con movies fall flat because they are too easy: they assume an ignorance of the viewer, and build up to a gimmicky twist upon which the entire film depends. If you manage to figure it out in advance, the film collapses. In ""House of Games,"" writer/director David Mamet tackles the idea of con men in a new and different way: this film is not about cons themselves, but the characters who are drawn to that lifestyle. The more interesting twists here are not the plot ones, but the character ones, as they get sucked deeper and deeper into this dark yet alluring way of life.

The film centers around Margaret Ford, a therapist whose patient owes a large debt to a man named Mike at the titular ""House of Games."" Ford goes to speak with Mike, and gets lured into his seedy world of greed and confidence games. At first Ford is hesitant, but she is drawn more and more into Mike's world.

The film itself is a ""House of Games,"" and there are a number of well-placed plot twists that keep the film engaging and surprising. As I mentioned, however, the twists are not the point of the film, and what is most fascinating here are the characters. The film functions primarily as a character study of Margaret, a woman who is seduced into this world and finds herself unable to leave or escape it.

Mamet's writing is as strong and engaging as ever, with characters constantly talking over one another and interrupting themselves and each other in a desperate search for clarity and understanding. His direction is careful and slow, but never boring: his camera is a very objective one, following the characters as they go further down the rabbit hole and deeper into his house of games.

""House of Games"" is a taut, neonoir thriller that is well-crafted and intelligent. It isn't your average con man movie, but it tackles much larger themes of human nature and addiction and seduction and greed. You won't be disappointed.",1266537600,5,1927,4.642228739002933
791781,4,6304108877,"I am going to describe to you the facts of this case. The entire situation in this movie takes place in the mind of the woman. It is, in effect, a dream created in her imaginary writing.

Right from the beginning, you should not accept that she is a successful psychologist. She is, in fact, a patient in a mental ward. It is important to remember that the only real person is her doctor. (The mentor) All the material about cons is a novel she is writing and living in her imagination. Each scene that begins a con, she is shown in a dark room beginning the imaginary adventure, SUDDENLY, she is there, and the adventure begins.

How do we know this? It is shown to us in the film. The characters patient files and folders upon close inspection reveal that ""Mike"" is a character that she has created in her writing, He is written down as ""The unbeatable gambler"" and ""a deliverer of punishment"", The trouble is she has not met him yet! Also along with the address, including the ""House of games"", with a brief written description of the scenes!

Notice also the gun used in the initial gambling scene in ""House of Games"". The gambler lays down a true combat Colt 45. After Margaret writes out the check to ""C.A.S.H."" for $6,000 she is unable to cope with the gun and says it is a water pistol (imaginary once again) The next shot shows a distinctly different pistol than the original combat 45 that was laid down the first time! (it has a water-gun cap on the end of it!)

Also there is the illogic of money. First she is told that her ""patient"" owes $25,000. Later Mike tells her he owes only $800 dollars! If she had the money she reveals later, it would be logical to pay the $800 to Mike immediately but she is conned into a situation where she is ready to hand over $6,000! Later she hands over $80,000! and still later she hands over $250,000!!! Didn't anyone find that strange? The character, William Hahn, tells her she is ""rich, successful, making lots of money"" NOT LIVING IN REALITY BUT IN A DREAM WORLD. (It's a clue!)

 ALL of the adventures do not exist. It is all in her mind.  This was at the suggestion of ""The Mentor"" (in reality, her doctor) in the beginning. She is ""busy"" and told to ""relax"" and start an interesting distraction. All in All, because she is really a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane, she only writes 2 pages. LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE BLACK BINDER AND READ IT.

 We are also shown 2 patients. BOTH OF THEM ARE REALLY OUR MAIN CHARACTER! The imaginary situations of patient/psychologist talks, the woman in the white gown (in reality a reflection of our main character, who has murdered her father)including the ""man with the gun"" who you are led to believe gets her involved in a trail of gambling and con man scams. In reality it was her attempt to commit suicide after she killed her father, most likely for rape.

 The image of Margaret that you see throughout the movie is how the real mental patient wishes she looked like. A ""normal"" person in her mind. (The opposite of her) Blond, Blue Eyed, Sexy, successful, a novelist, rich beyond the dreams of avarice, wearing clothing and a haircut that looks like she stepped out of Vogue magazine! Our only clue to reality is her constant chain smoking, which mental patients are known for, especially to keep them calm in traumatic situations! CAMEL non filters, one of the strongest on the market.

The novel is her attempt to cope with the tragic reality of her shooting her father. This comes out constantly in conversations with her ""Mentor/Doctor"". First at the Restaurant when she says ""pressure"" instead of ""Pleasure"". The second and most important is after the second interview with the ""murderess"". She finds the Doctor in the hall looking over a clipboard. Didn't anyone notice the fade out scenes of the bars/security guard (who disappears yet is in front of her) and the darkened hall? She approaches the doctor and discusses the case of the ""murderess"". She is taken ""outside"" in the more ""pleasant"" surroundings (I believe this is the doctor's office, where she is free to let her thoughts be expressed) and REVEALS THAT SHE MURDERED HER FATHER. To which the Doctor says she was NOT Responsible. She is not a murderess. Another freudian tongue slip!

 The character ""MIKE"" IS IN FACT, HER FATHER in the movie. The character is trying to work out her guilt. He is rough, nasty, but willing to show her the ""dirty"" side of life. He constantly uses her. She is ""learning"" the ropes. Eventually she begins a relationship with him. She ""makes love"" but if you notice, you don't really see a love scene. Just two people in light banter and suddenly separated, one on a chair, the other getting dressed on the bed. The ""Hotel"" is not real either. Look carefully how this entire scene began, you will notice it is in her imagination again, beginning in her office.

Later he degrades her and the final shooting scene which seems so out of place makes perfect sense because that was how her father was killed, she shot him while he was hurling abuses at her and the ""urge for more"" on behalf of the character is not bragging, but ""he asked for it"" in her deranged mind. Notice the accent on the word ""Whore"".

ALL THE CONS SHOULD BE IGNORED Which by the way, are the oldest tricks in the books on con games that almost anyone with street savy knows by heart. That is why ""Mike"" says it is ""Dinosaur"" cons. She is incapable in her mind of plotting anything better.

Everything involving the ""plots"" with the cons are reflective of what happened in real life to the psychologist but are ""desguised"". The 3rd scene with her ""mentor/doctor"" outside the classroom (the doctor is giving a lecture on obsessive compulsive disorders.) She approaches her once again (the doctor having all the time in the world for her despite an obviously busy schedule) notice that the backround is not pleasant but dark and problem oriented. She is close to resolving her imagination into reality! She returns to her ""office"", destroys her writing (the black binder) , the TWO FILES OF THE SO CALLED PATIENTS, picks up her ""successful best-seller on obsession/compulsion disorders. Which by the way, if you look closely has a picture of a gambler on it that ""looks"" like Mike and throws it at her imaginary degree,(once again too perfect, John Hopkins University and Harvard before that!) she picks up the phone (there is no one on the other end) and effectively CANCELS HER CAREER AS A PSYCHOLOGIST.

Yet one patient gets through, the suicidal, who now looks a lot better! He gets into a VERY DISTINCTIVE RED CADDY CONVERTIBLE!(The ""stolen"" vehicle, which any cop would find in 5 minutes of a reported theft.) The color RED is used again and again as ""entry"" and ""exit"" symbols from her imaginary adventures! She follows him to the ""Charlies Tavern"" (2 red streaks on the street leading to the bar.)How she followed him is not shown (because it is in her imagination again!) Here she hears from her Lover/Father's own lips how she was abused and plans a BIG REVENGE!

This leads to what to some was the mysterious shooting at the airport, that a lot of people found odd, but of course now makes perfect sense, because it is an imaginative coping mechanism by which our character is working out her guilt.

In the end, she is at the ""Waldorf"" with her doctor once again in beautiful surroundings (imaginary). She has ""escaped"" her situation. Her doctor says she is looking better, as if the guilt or something on her mind had eased. Once again they never eat. She follows through with the original advice of her doctor. A man comes up for her to have her book signed. She uses the very words of the doctor. ""FORGIVE YOURSELF"" she writes as she ""signs"" the book. Any real psychologist can tell you that often a lot of committed people imagine they are doing something very important and the ""book"" is her importance, from beginning to end.

Once again, the doctor is called away by a nurse (waitress) just at the moment they would order food in the ""Waldorf"". Remembering now to take a ""momento"" from what her father taught her, she steals an imaginary lighter from a woman at the next table, and lights a cigarette right in front of her with the ""stolen"" lighter.

All of the background scenery regarding the cons are ""perfect"" hollywood style noir film locations. This was probably due to the experience of the character, creating scenes that are ""movie"" locations where exciting things happen all the time.

If you doubt anything I have said here, go back and look at the film scenes I spoke about and LISTEN to what is being said. It is VERY important. The facts of the movie will bear it out.",1262563200,6,8676,4.6049222797927465

House of Games is for the most part an intriguing thriller about confidence men which shouldn't be terribly predictable even if you've seen a lot of these types of films, but it flies off the rails in the final act (when a character says ""Thank you sir may I have another"" I was rolling my eyes very hard) and Mamet could certainly have used a better actress in the lead than Lindsay Crouse (aka Mrs. Mamet); House of Games is a decent movie but the director's later effort The Spanish Prisoner takes similar ideas and does them much better.

791834,4,6304108877,"House of Games was playwright David Mamet's directorial debut and it's subject matter is one of his most familiar: con men and the art of the con. In a rare move the main character is a female who happens to be played by his then wife Lindsay Crouse. Dr. Margaret Ford (Crouse) is a bestselling author whose latest book is about compulsive behavior. She is too busy to enjoy her success and she throws herself into her work. This concerns her colleagues who worry about her frame of mind. A nervous patient shows up in Margaret's office one day claiming that he is in bad to a dangerous man named Mike (the excellent Joe Mantegna). The patient is armed and threatens to blow his brains out since he'll never be able to come up with the money. Margaret calms him down and offers to speak to Mike on his behalf and see if she can work something out. She learns that Mike plays poker at a smoky bar called the House of Games. When she tracks Mike down he asks her to come in on a con with him. Mike is trying to read a fellow player's hand and he tells Margaret that if she can distract the other guy he will reduce her friend's debt. The con works and Margaret is fascinated by the mechanics of it and is eager to learn more. Mike is all too happy to show her with the help of his associates (including Mamet regular Ricky Jay) and they give her the history of the con until the early morning hours. Margaret becomes obsessed with Mike and the two start seeing more and more of each other. Mike draws her deeper and deeper into his world and Margaret is all too willing to go along. We are as seduced by Mike as Margaret is. He's a smooth talker who could convince anyone to do anything based on his charm alone. Mamet tricks us into identifying and focusing our attention on him rather than the good doctor. This film is a clever, and fun ride the way all well made con job movies are. . Mamet's directing is very sparse and he only gives a little information at a time which suits the material well. In a film where knowledge is power Mamet gives us as little as we need to figure things out on our own. Since it's a Criterion disc you know that the image is going to be amazing and the bonuses are going to be informative. There are two recent interviews with stars Joe Mantegna and Lindsay Crouse who talk about their relationship with Mamet. There is an archival making of shot on location by the producers which has good footage of Mamet tirelessly rehearsing his actors so that their delivery is in perfect rhythm. The best extra is the audio commentary between Mamet and Ricky Jay. These guys are as hilarious and colorful as the characters they create which makes for a very wild commentary.

But as a Criterion Collection release, ""House of Games"" has precious few additions.  It is nice to get a commentary by Ricky Jay and Mamet himself, and the other brief interviews and video footage are okay, but for me personally it doesn't justify the SIGNIFICANT price increase over the original bare-bones video release.

I'm a fan of Mamet's plays, books, and films, and so it pains me a little to have less-than-complimentary things to say here.  But this edition should qualify as rental-only for anyone who already owns the previous release.  Since no store in my area carries this Criterion title, I reluctantly made the choice to purchase it and hoped I would be overwhelmed enough to justify the extra $$$.  I enjoyed the bonus features, but had a bit of buyer's remorse due to the high price.

Mike-  Played by Mantegna is an old school con man a dinosaur of con men.  He can talk with the best of them.

Easily, the highlight for David Mamet fans is the audio commentary with the man and actor Ricky Jay. These two old friends engage in lively philosophical discussions on a variety of topics, including why President Bush is such a terrible liar, the art of the con game and why psychiatry is a scam. Ricky Jay talks about the nature of the con and some of the lingo involved while keeping Mamet talking by prodding him with questions. Mamet is his usual blunt self as he constantly talks about how Orion messed up distributing the film in this engaging and thought-provoking commentary.

There is an interview with actress Lindsay Crouse who mentions that Mamet wrote the role of Dr. Ford for her (They were married at the time) and says that he spent five years trying to get the film made because the studios found the material too dark.

Also included is an interview with Joe Mantegna. He talks about his history with Mamet that goes back to Chicago theatre in the 1970s. He eventually appeared in the stage version of Glengarry Glen Ross when Al Pacino turned it down and went on to win a Tony for it. He talks about how he related to the character of Mike and recounts some amusing anecdotes about filming.

""David Mamet on House of Games"" is 25-minute making of featurette that the film's producer and his wife shot in Vermont while Mamet was preparing the film and in Seattle while he was shooting it. There is some great footage of Mamet and his buddies playing poker in Vermont. The same guys also appear in the film in the poker scene.

791902,5,6304108877,"This is hands down one of my all time favorite movies.  It's an exercise in psychological warfare that will leave you wondering who is the bigger con artist; the artist himself or the psychologist who diagnoses him as such?  It is the story about a famous, well respected psychologist and author who falls for a con man and discovers traits in herself that she would rather not know about.  She is an addict waiting for a fix and finds that fix in a con man named ""Mike"".  The story then turns into a cat and mouse tale where the hunter gets captured by the game. While the theme is somewhat predictable and you sense what is going to happen, the ending is entirely unpredictable and you are rewarded for seeing it through.  The dialogue is slow and highly stylized, more like a play than a movie.

*** SPOILER ALERT ***

Mamet plays with the notion that you never really know who anybody is.  Is he a small town gambler or a pawn in a game?  Which brings me to the poker game.  The poker game has, what, 5 or six players (I'm doing this by memory): Mike, Joey, George, and two or three other players.

Now, even though they leave after the ""game"" (as in poker) ends, are they part of the con?  What about the bartender?  You could even go as far as asking if anyone from that world isn't in on it.  And then you can ask, well what about Dr. Ford's friend, Dr. Littauer?

Then you have the mysterious and charming ""gambler"", Mantegna, who acts as her guide.  The two of them enter what appears to be a wonderfully seductive and fascinating relationship that only grows more complicated and unpredictable as the film progresses - I do not want to play the spoiler here.

791905,5,6304108877,"In his 1987 directorial debut, HOUSE OF GAMES, master writer David Mamet delivers a chilling account of the relationship between Dr. Margaret Ford and a low rent gangster named Mike who tries to seduce her.

A psychological thriller that features the acting chops of Mamet's then wife, Lindsay Crouse and character actor Joe Montegna, HOUSE OF GAMES really stars Mamet's brilliant dialouge that captivates the audience with its hypnotic rhythms and captivating sentence structures.

In a nutshell the plot is simple.  In this dark drama, Dr. Ford is an emotionally conservative psychologist and best selling author of a self help book.  Through one of her patients she meets Mike, an underworld gangster type who charms her with his tales of the cons he and his cohorts use to swindle seemingly innocent people.

Believing she is becoming privvy to the secret world of gamblers and con artists, Dr. Ford drops her guard and follows Mike through a series of cons that seem to work flawlessly.

At times a suspicious person who trusts no one, Dr. Ford at other times appears to be pliable stooge, easily manipulated by a seasoned con man.  But is she really as innocent and as naive as she appears?  Or is Mike the real stool pigeon?  It is never easy to say for sure, even when the film ends.

But one thing is definitely clear half way through the film: Dr. Margaret Ford is not as honest nor as much in control as her patients believe.  But who will pay the price for a con gone awry?  No one knows until the final scene closes and you are left to wonder what secrets lie behind the faces of the innocent and the guilty alike.

791906,3,6304108877,"Many years ago, someone recommended this film to me, and I can understand why. It's a clever film, full of surprises as the protagonist psychiatrist is drawn into the world of confidence men, finding herself fascinated by their very different life. Mamet is known for his dialogue, perfected on the stage, that tries to recreate ""normal"" speaking patterns. It might be normal, but it's not necessarily realistic. What I like about it is the quickness of it (something also from the stage), moving on from character to character without necessarily waiting for the audience to follow.

Unfortunately, I must have seen enough of these kinds of movies because I was able to predict a number of the surprises, including the major one. Still, I enjoyed the movie and would be willing to see another one by Mamet.",1140825600,5,807,4.890510948905109
791907,3,6304108877,"When I first began House of Games, I hated it.  I hated the language, I hated the characters, I hated the tone, but then something changed.  Mamet finally took control of this film and pulled the audience in by tricking all of us into thinking this was a film about a young love and the darkness of the world, when instead it was all about something deeper.  If you go into this film expecting the classic 1980s clich of woman meets man, man is a criminal, woman changes man thus leading to a sloppy wet ending, you will be utterly disappointed.  This structure is initially how I envisioned this film, and with the first half an hour filmed the way it was, there was no doubt in my mind that I had been suckered into just another average crime film.  Then, midway through the picture, the tones and themes dramatically change.  I didn't even see it coming, but when you least expect it, like the ""con"" performed in this film, it will blindside you quicker than a deer on the highway.  House of Games leaves you with this perfect example of just how dark David Mamet is.

This is a film that most will either hate or love.  The reason that I say this is because the language of the film is extremely ""stagey"".  Before this film, David Mamet had found his success with his plays.  The power of his characters, the unjustness of his plots, and the vile of his villains were key elements to packing his plays full of patrons.  In House of Games he attempts to bring the stage to the screen without any changes.  You can literally hear the beats between the characters when they are talking.  The language that they use feel and sound as if they are acting in front of a live audience, not just for the camera.  This makes the words a bit stale at times.  You can visually see this film as a play because of the language that is used.  Again, some will hate this about the film, while others will see it as nothing short of classic Mamet.  For me, I hated it at first, but as the film developed, I began to see the logic behind it.  The quickness of the conversations between the characters gave more definition to the ""con"" that they were trying to perform.  I always felt as if they were quickly getting something by me.  About the middle of the film, I began listening to every word said afraid that I would miss a key element that would unravel this tight plot.  I began waiting for scenes where Margaret (Crouse) would stumble on her words, change the meaning, thus allowing us to develop the evil that was within her.  Slowly and steadily this ""stagey"" language worked for me, and it gave just a small addition to the characters.

For anyone that has ever seen most of Mamet's film versions (and some of his stage performances) you will notice that he is notorious for using the same characters throughout.  I like this quite a bit.  Christopher Guest uses the same technique.  While I have talked to some that think that it only shows the repetition of his originality, I think that it gives Mamet definition and substance.  I loved watching this early film of Mamet's and see a young William H. Macy in a scene and his use of my favorite J.T. Walsh.  It is fun to watch these actors grow in Mamet's films.  Many of them you can see in State & Main and Heist.  Does that mean that they are necessarily good actors then?  I don't think so.  While I liked the continual use of the same characters, some (more than others), have trouble with the characters.  For example, in House of Games, it was obvious that Lindsay Crouse did not have control over her character.  She seemed fake in her scenes, and did not counter will with Mantegna (who gave a great performance).  She seemed on a different beat compared to the others in this film, and I think it hurt House of Games somewhat.  She wasn't the strongest actress that Mamet could have chosen.

While I loved the ""con"" throughout the film, I did feel as if the ending was a bit on the weak side.  Without giving it away, it started to feel used before it was over.  I knew deep within me where it was going, but I kept waiting for the big ""hurrah"", but alas, there wasn't any.  That is where Mamet missed his mark.  The ending needed to be stronger.  I loved watching this simple woman transform into evil and the entire themes that went along with that, but I needed more.  I loved the anti-romantic notion of this film, but I needed more.  I loved the character interactions in this film, but I needed more.  That was exactly how I felt about this film.  I loved House of Games, but I needed more.  Mamet ended the film without giving us closure, and while the rest of the film was exciting to watch, this ending just left me soured.

Overall, I loved it, but I don't think that I could watch it again.  Mamet is one of the greatest writers of our generation providing us with some very ""cult"" anti-Hollywood cinema, but this first film was a rough-cut.  It was smart, intelligent, and overall a stage version of his play onto film.  A stronger transition was needed from stage to screen.  The characters were somewhat developed and the plot was sensational.  The darkness by the end of the film caught me unprepared.  I liked this film, but a second viewing is not in my future.  I love David Mamet's work and cannot wait to submerge myself into more of his films later.

791979,4,6304108877,"Margaret Ford is cool, detached, removed--an observer--traits that are the basis for her success as a psychologist and writer of well-paying pop-psychology. One of her patients, a gambler, is in debt to a fellow gambler and hustler named Mike. Confident in her powers to persuade others to act contrary to their immediate best interests, Margaret offers to talk to Mike. It is, of course, an act of hubris, an act of self-appraisal wanting correction--an act of pride inviting a fall. So that night, she makes her way to the House of Games, a seedy little bar in a dark, desolate corner of Seattle where Mike and his crew gather to play cards in a dark still--in an atmosphere resembling her own office. Mike is cool, detached, removed--an observer--traits that are the basis for his success as a gambler and con man. He makes a rather extraordinary offer: he will tear up the IOU's if Margaret will help him in the execution of his present hustle. Mike talks close, talks in a low knowing whisper. She's either in or she isn't. Then he gives her a glimpse of his method--he shows her how he watches for ""tells""--little tics, twitches and hiccups, as it were, in the body language of his victim--unconscious signaling of what someone is thinking, what someone knows, what some had meant to hide from others. It must seem frighteningly familiar to a psychologist--but so very intriguing when applied to another and evil purpose. She accepts; and so begins a series of twists and turns that oblige you to wonder, till the very end, at which point the con actually began.

The language of this film is characteristic of Mamet at his best. It is highly stylized, an endless succession of ellipses, faints, and echoes. Every statement seems suspect, delivered in heavy quotes. There may only be a single additional second between sentences, but it seems so long, so otherworldly. Outwardly ordinary-looking statements seem busy with other meaning, with mystery and possible misdirection. It is a language befitting both psychologist and con man--observers who ultimately seek control over others, though admittedly for very different ends. But as the film gradually unfolds, you may find yourself laboring to discriminate between a con man who manipulates and controls and a psychologist who steers and directs. In the end, they only succeed in conning themselves, having forgotten that they are dealing with human beings who, possessed with powers of reason tempered and bent by emotions, often skid, slip and spin down unexpected, unintended and sometimes unlovely cul-de sacs.",1112745600,3,2574,5.042253521126761
791980,4,6304108877,"This review contains spoilers.

I wasn't aware of this movie when it was released and heard of it only recently because I got to know and like the work of actress Lindsay Crouse in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Hack.""

The movie got high marks from the IMDb crowd and on Amazon.com, but I've been burned that way many times so expected to be disappointed by ""House of Games,"" too.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie far above average. I'd put it in the top 10 percent of all the movies I've seen.

I'm so glad David Mamet decided to make this movie with his wife in the lead and his friend Joe Montegna playing Mike. Both actors are perfectly cast.

That said, I do have three minor quibbles with the movie. (Spoilers coming.) First, it seemed obvious to me that Lindsay's character was being conned when the briefcase containing $80,000 went missing and Lindsay offered to reimburse the con men. Concomitantly, it didn't make sense that Lindsay's character wouldn't catch on at that point that she was being conned.

Later in the movie, Lindsay visits the bar where the con men hang out. She enters late at night through the back door, which was all too conveniently unlocked.

Lastly, when Lindsay and Joe have their final confrontation they are in the baggage handling area of a large airport. And no one else is around. Not even close enough, apparently, to hear six gunshots.

But these are small complaints compared to the overall quality of the movie. ""House of Games"" is a gem.",1111190400,2,1498,4.626415094339623
791981,3,6304108877,"David Mamet's directorial debut manages to impress, even with less than perfect execution. The talented writer delivers a compelling story which handily makes up for the few awkward points of strained acting or poorly executed dialogue. At times this movie seems predictable, and yet throughout, Mamet manages to exploit that predictability and turn it upside down. When you watch this movie, you find yourself equally nonchalant and fascinated. Joe Mantegna does a good job as the cool con-man, and delivers a performance both more realistic and more comfortable than the protagonist, played by Mamet's then wife Lindsay Crouse. Although Crouse does manage to pull off several critical scenes well--particularly the last scene, which is one of the best in the movie. In House of Games, like in so much of Mamet's work, we really see the characters develop: they resist and flounder, but they grow. So many movies these days fail to achieve that simple, yet crucial, development of character. This is definitely worth seeing.",1093392000,2,1025,5.218181818181818
791982,5,6304108877,"David Mamet's ""House of Games,"" is another of that director's giant flip jobs.  I've been working my way through the Mamet catalogue, and one can't help but feel the director sees the world itself as a giant con.  Well, that's perhaps a bit simplistic, but Mamet does cling, in movie after movie, to some core principles.  One of these is that you must trust no one.  In ""Spartan,"" ""The Spanish Prisoner,"" and ""House of Games,"" this very line is uttered, usually by a villain to an innocent.  This sounds like a negative credo, but it really isn't.  First, consider who's issuing the warning: the villain.  Will the innocent learn from experience?  And will the learning result in corruption? (Important questions for Mamet.) Second, trusting yourself and knowing yourself (weaknesses included) in a dangerous world is advisable, necessary, in order to survive .  I have to believe Mamet is a big reader of Joseph Conrad.
The story behind ""House of Games,"" involves Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford, a doctor and popular author.  Her ""big book"" is titled ""Driven,"" about compulsive and addictive personalities.  It doesn't take long to figure out the book is about herself.  So driven is Margaret that she is beginning to make Freudian slips in her conversations, slips that reveal dark corners of her own personality.  She may be heading for a breakdown - and a teaching colleague warns her, tells her she must slow down.  But ""slowing down"" comes as another writing project presents itself, seemingly accidently due to the dilemma of a patient , when Margaret is introduced to the world of the Con at a local bar and pool hall called ""House of Games.""  This introduction comes at the hands of Mike (Joe Mantegna), a handsome and slick con man who is willing to provide a tour - though he does warn her: ""Trust no one.""
To reveal any more would be telling.  Like all Mamet films, the dialogue is essential.  I don't think I've ever seen a director make such interesting use of dialogue.  On one level the dialogue in all of Mamet's films (that I've seen so far) is seemingly stilted.  But it works!  Why?  I can only attribute this to Mamet's precision as a director.  What seems stilted, comes across instead as elevated speech - as in Shakespeare.  Mamet is a dramatic poet who no doubt has Shakespeare's great maxim engraved upon his mind, and present in the framing of each scene: ""Suit the action to the word, and the word to the action.""  (Good actors must love working with this guy.)  So pay attention, there's no fat in a Mamet film, and always plenty to ponder. ""House of Games"" is no different.  See it.",1089936000,11,2614,4.71523178807947
791983,4,6304108877,"As one other reviewer here very accurately put it: ""we've become smarter since this movie was made"". Especially when we've since seen mega-stunners like the ""Usual suspects"" or ""Sixth Sense"", movies that took the ""film with a twist""-genre to a whole new plataeu.
  A hotshot psychologist finds out the hard way that her trade doesn't cut it much down at the streets when she becomes emotionally (and otherwise) involved with a con-man and his circuit. As she's awed by all the ""rules"" and even more so the tricks that make the con-world spin, she asks to be ""shown more"", only to see that being shown more includes being caught in an invisible and catastrophic spider web. I don't want to give the plot away since this is obviously the strength of the film, but ""House of Games"" was one of the premier twist films for the time it was made, even if it might seem dated today.
  Some of the twists might (emphasis on the ""might"") be somewhat predictable but that would be the case only for the very initiated viewer.
  Mamet has got some great scripts under his belt, but if there's one thing that seriously undermines his film hee (he also directed it) is the acting of J.Crouse. While Joe Mantegna (the other lead in the movie) is in my opinion absolutely great, Crouse gives a half-dead performance, wooden and surreally uninspired, especially when one considers that she was acting (?) a part in a solid story. Were it not for her terrible performance this movie would be elevated into whole new heights.
  Some people thought that the dialogue was problematic, but in my view it's exactly the bizzarity of the dialogue that makes the ""House of Games"" all the more special. The dialogues are unique in the way things are being said and not in what is being said.
  But otherwise, this is a great film, also in a historical way, since it provided a cue for many scriptwriters since, with maybe better results but this doesn't diminish this film's importance.

791984,5,6304108877,"House of games is one of my eternal favorites ones. I watch it at least once each year. It's a Pandora's box for everyone. First at all Mamet is a very clever scripter. And after watching Winslow's honor six months ago I think he's one of the most creative directors in the american cinema.
Joe Mantegna has never been best. Lindsay Cruise in his role as psychiatrist is widely believeable.
Grey my friend is all theory, and green the golden tree of the life. This smart sentence in Fausto, would seem to be the starting point for Mamet about the develpoment of this psycodrama that you may well without too much effort, to classify it as a modern film noir.
A famous psychiatrist, that knows everything about the behavior's phenomens of the human being, is really a woman who never has experienced many issues. Suddenly the evil presence of Joe Mantegna will break all her theories , and literally will throw her by a world of new emotions and sensations. An authentic journey by the hidden face life. Interesting script with a high sense of suspense with Hitchockian accents and a touch of Chabrol. This well known and distingued scientist is seduced in the widest sense of the word, by this mysterious man and the world he lives. Slowly you'll be sinking with her in the underworld almost without realizing.
Mantegna works out as a link between Mefistho and Don Juan, and he really wins.

791985,4,6304108877,"HOUSE OF GAMES presents the audience with one who craves relief from a life of quiet desperation.
Lindsay Crouse is Dr. Margaret Ford, an author/psychiatrist specializing in addictive behavior. Margaret is also tightly wound. Her workspace is compulsively organized; she wears little make-up; her attire is colorless and severely simple. Her manner of speaking is forceful, but devoid of emotion. And Dr. Ford no longer believes that her professional efforts matter. She hasn't got a life.
During an office therapy session, an anguished patient brandishes a pistol and threatens suicide. Margaret promises to help the man if he'll give her the gun. He does, then reveals that he owes thousands of dollars to a gambler named Mike, and he'll be physically hurt if he doesn't pay up. That night, the doctor goes to THE HOUSE OF GAMES, confronts Mike (Joe Mantegna), and demands that he lay off her patient. Taken aback, Mike claims he's owed only eight-hundred dollars, and will write off the debt if Margaret will join him at his side in a back room card game and help him outmaneuver an opponent. Ford agrees, unaware that the whole scenario is a set-up to bilk her out of six thousand dollars. However, a mistake by one of the scammers allows the mark to detect the ruse. Confronted by Ford's natural outrage, an embarrassed Mike and his co-conspirators say, ""Hey, it was nothing personal, just business"", and proceed to make amends by becoming sociable. Attracted to Mike, Margaret seeks him out again the next night, and a relationship develops between the two as the latter becomes fascinated with the shadowy world of con artistry.
The hurdle I immediately had to get over was Crouse's way of delivering her lines. My wife thought it was just abysmally bad acting. But, on reflection, I decided it was part and parcel of the uptight Ford character along with the attire and personal appearance. Having accepted that, I went on to savor the evolution of the plot, which included a twist that was, in retrospect, perhaps not so surprising.
Filmed in Seattle, certain late night scenes are evocative of Dennis Hopper paintings wherein people wait in brightly lighted places for something to energize their lonely lives. As the camera focuses on exterior shots of ""The House of Games"" or ""Charlie's"" bar, the neon and florescent signs broadcast their false promise of warmth into the cold darkness of deserted city streets.
In the last scene, Margaret's now-colorful clothing is indication that she's experienced a catharsis. Boy, has she ever!",1072828800,,2544,5.002358490566038
791986,2,6304108877,"The thing about House Of Games is that you're sure its lame until the last 30 minutes or so and after you've finished watching it, you still can't decide if you like it or not. Regardless, it doesn't hold up to repeated viewings.
The horrible acting (especially from Mamet's then-wife Linsay Crouse) and stiff dialogue, along with the ill-advised lighting homage to film noir almost play into the ""con"" Mamet is playing on the viewer. Still, that doesn't make it *enjoyable* to watch.
The theme of pairing pyschology with the con artist is loaded with potential. However, it is not explored enough. The scenes between the doctor and her patient are Ed Wood bad. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad photography and, most of all, empty. Similarly, the scenes with Maria, the older shrink professor, are too obvious. The ""Freudian slips"" are just amateurish. There is no excuse for this, as these scenes can't be explained away by being ensconsed in the world of confidence games, where neither party has their guard down and may be trying to lead the other on. For more on this, read Mike Stone's review below.
Overall, while the plot becomes clever in an unconventional way, there was way too much raw potential that went unrealized. The cons are somewhat obvious and lame. We know the ""big con"" before Maggie does and what she does from there isn't clever, but instead relies on the character development, which was pretty much nil up to this point. Mamet crowbars the subtle aspects of her character in there. Subtle as a flying mallet. And yet, he doesn't want to spend too much time on them (wisely) so he relies on singular scenes with the mental patient or her mentor Maggie and all I can say is these scenes are woefully lacking in all aspects. Good scene writing escaped Mamet in this movie. Not to mention any dialogue that rises above *painfully* bad.
The script, in this sense, is its own worst enemy. The basic structure is fine, but the scene-to-scene execution is pitiful. Couple that with bad acting and (at times) cheesy cinematography and it's just too bad that a solid idea was so underdeveloped.
I wish Mamet had done two things: (1) Revised the script a number of times and made it far better and (2) Let someone else direct it. He adapted the scrpit for The Verdict which was, in my opinion, a fine job of screenwriting. However, Sidney Lumet's direction and Newman's acting sent it over the top.

792049,3,6304108877,"Watching the con(s) play out was the absolute best aspect of this film. Everything was rolled into everything else. As with THE SPANISH PRISONER, we don't get the --perhaps-- more enjoyable perspective of the conners, only of the conned. This isn't necessarily bad. HOUSE OF GAMES is a classic for many reasons, I think the direction is not at all bad, and the overall plot is interesting. However, I think it suffers many of the problems that beset THE SPANISH PRISONER.
Mamet's dialogue is always kind of obtusely overwrought. No surprises there. This isn't problemmatic, however, if the actor succeeds in making delivering these lines so that they seem natural. When that does succeed, the dialogue can seem brilliant and provokative. Witness, for instance, Gene Hackman or Danny DeVito in THE HEIST. When it doesn't, it comes across absurd, self-indulgent, and farcical.
That brings us to the chokingly bad performance of Lindsay Crouse. She is the woman pshrink with the best-selling book and godawful ""eighties"" hairdo. No empathy is deserved here, nor earned. After seeing some of Rebecca Pidgeon's performances, it seems Mamet has a penchant for actresses with the vibrancy and subtlty of drying paint. Beige paint. Crouse's line delivery had the painful quality of chewing plywood; one begins to think that in the middle of a line she will fall asleep or something.
Joe Montegna is excellent, deftly playing out his character to attract not only the woman pshrink, but the audience as well. In his final scene, where we are subjected to just how awful he is, we are shocked at the romanticized perspective we took of the con-man lifestyle.
All in all, HOUSE OF GAMES has become a classic of sorts. Mainly this is because most of the other movies of its era were simply awful (what to do when E.T sets the benchmark?). It certainly exceeds the garish, silly, and painfully inept THE SPANISH PRISONER. The psychological gaming is simply far more sophisticated. The directing --and for a first-time director-- is commendable. Mamet plays with a couple of twisting shots, but mostly he lets the murky and wet city-scape do his work for him.",1019347200,3,2145,4.977715877437326
792050,4,6304108877,"The script of ""House of Games"" probably has some of the most brazen plot twists and wicked undercurrents that I've seen in all of film. You'd almost think the director, David Mamet - who won a Pulitzer for a 1984 play - holds the audience in contempt, since the main character in the movie, a psychiatrist with a best-selling motivational book, experiences every deception and con with as little perspicacity as the viewer (unless you know what to expect).
The movie is basically a study on ruses and truth. It's funny to see Dr. Ford being strung along by Byzantine plots throughout the film; but kind of disturbing to see how the experience has affected her in the end. The ploys perpetrated by the confidence men in the film should inspire some slack-jawed admiration and awe, even if there success in real life would be questionable. I think in certain works it is OK to accept these kinds of slightly dubious happenings if they further the thematic purpose of the film. I mean, how many people out there would really fall for Chance's unwitting faade in ""Being There.""
I hold the opinion that ""House of Games"" would have been an even greater achievement as a book. It might be one of those films where reading its screenplay is superior to actually watching the final product. The direction is good from a layman's perspective, but there's a strange forced, muted quality to the actor's interactions. They talk to each other like, well, con men and ultra-professionals. The actors are told to perform in a way that doesn't appeal to me much, but maybe I'm missing the point.
The doctor is a strong character - tough, competent, yet still with that hidden, unexplored crevice that cries out for genuine human affection and attachment. The warmer side of her personality is vital to the film's success because the audience couldn't identify with her if she was made of iron and never got hurt. It's also doubtful that she would have fallen into the long, convoluted trap that she did otherwise. The ending of the film is compelling and rather twisted, and probably created some good material for psychology term papers.",1018656000,8,2122,4.784741144414169
792051,3,6304108877,"House of Games is a very interesting movie. However, there are things that drive me crazy about it. For some reason, David Mamet's scripts always have people repeating each others questions. This gets really annoying after only 30 minutes. Plus, the acting seems bad because all of the actors seem so emotionally detached from the goings on. They are like teenagers reading from a script, with zero emotion or interest. Then again, maybe it is simply bad acting.",998697600,,462,4.935897435897436
792052,5,6304108877,"This is an absolutely mesmerizing film. A wonderful addition to that genre known as ""film noir"", the movie is superlative in every way. In his directorial debut, David Mamet shows a keen understanding of the concept ""less is more"".
 The two main characters in the film are a well known psychiatrist with a best selling book, Dr. Margaret Ford, played with chilly determinism by Lindsay Crouse, and a slick con man, known only as Mike, brilliantly played by Joe Mantegna with a sinister, charismatic charm. She is stiff and formal. He is casual and seemingly easygoing. Each is involved in a field of endeavor that requires a keen understanding of human nature.
 They meet by virtue of what each of them does for a living. Dr. Ford is treating a young patient, who claims to be despondent over getting in over his head financially, while gambling at a disreputable and seedy locale known as the House of Games. She is worried about her patient's potential for suicide, so she decides to go to the House of Games to see if she can straighten out the whole mess.
 There, she meets Mike, the person to whom the debt is owed. From the moment they meet, there is a latent, sexual tension between them and an aura of danger and seduction that permeates the air. Intrigued by him, she is drawn into his world, where things are not always what they seem. There are many twists and turns in this most unusual film, which deftly manipulates the viewer.
 The film is tautly crafted, and the dialogue itself is highly stylized with its own peculiar cadence. This serves to add to the air of mystery and suspense which infuses this film. There is an excellent supporting cast whose strong performances contribute to the overall quality of this multi-layered film. There is even a small cameo by William H. Macy. It is with good reason that this film was touted by critics as one of the best films for 1987. It meets the high standards set for this genre of film by the late, great director, Alfred Hitchcock. It is simply a stunning tour de force.",998697600,43,2033,4.607734806629834
792053,1,6304108877,"Lindsay Crouse does a hilarious impression of Keanu Reeves on horse tranquilizers, but that can't save this movie.  The plot twist is as deceptive as in ""Rocky IV"".  The dialogue, oh, the dialogue.  Here's a sample:

Margaret: I do not mind.

792054,5,6304108877,"I am a great devotee of the Con Artist movies.  The Sting, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Spanish Prisoner (also Mamet) and Traveller all were fine films, but none of them approach House of Games.  The reason for that, I think, is that nearly all of these other movies leave the viewer on the outside looking in and the con is always discernable to a person of average intelligence or better.  Here, however, Mamet cons the viewer right along with the female protagonist not once, but twice.  The effect is terrific.  There are a few rough edges in House, but overall it's Mamet's best work outside of Glengarry Glen Ross, which is in a class by itself.  It takes a small amount of patience to become involved in the action through the apparently boring opening 20 or 30 minutes, but that is the psychological key to the effect.  It would have been very much easier to start off with a bang like The Sting or Indiana Jones, but the initial subtlety of the screenplay (and direction) is what sets up the psychological aspect of the drama and allows such a big payoff at the end.  Like most of Mamet's work, this is a thinking person's film and in this regard, in particular, it is a better work than his other effort in the field The Spanish Prisoner.",991353600,7,1274,4.508695652173913

Mantegna was never better as the shark who implicates the icy best-selling psychiatrist (played equally well by Lindsay Crouse) in his nefarious games.  The photography is suitably slick and noirish, and with Mamet's usual corral of character actors (some of the best since Hollywood's studio days) and a script that will thrill, puzzle, and delight the viewer, there is nothing short of perfection in this tightly constructed movie.",987724800,4,724,5.513513513513513
792097,4,6304108877,"I didn't like ""House of Games"" while I watched it.  A lot of its elements were poorly executed, and they added up to an unfavourable experience for this member of its audience.  But given a few days reflection, I came to realize just how right those elements actually were.
First, there's the comparison between psychiatry and confidence games.  At first I felt this was inadequately explained, but then realized that neither side wanted to reveal its hand, to tell the other exactly what their goals were, for fear of being found out and losing the victim's confidence.  It reminded me of kung fu, in that the strengths of your opponent must be used against them first, before your own strengths are conjured up to finish them off.
Second, the dialogue was terribly hammy at times.  An indiscretion like this can be forgiven easily if it was another writer/director.  But this is David Mamet we're talking about.  Sure his scripts may not have a high pedigree when it comes to realistic talk, but they are usually stylish and interesting.  Here, there are some real clunkers.  Joe Mantegna, in the space of one conversation, actually says ""cut to the chase"" and ""gonna blow me into a billion bits and pieces"" (the second quotation may not be exactly what was said, but it's ineptitude still comes through) with a dead serious straight face.  Now, this comes fairly early in the story, so my justification is pretty much the same as above: he didn't want to show the full range of his intelligence, so he resorted to tired cliches and ridiculous alliteration (two signs of a weak mind!) to fool his mark.  Later, Mamet does uncoil some lines that are just pure gems, so if your patience prevails you will be rewarded.
Third, Lindsay Crouse was just unwatchable.  Now, I'm willing to admit that I had certain negative expectations for her (call it ""The Curse of Acting in a Mamet Film While Married To Him""; for further examples, see Rebecca Pidgeon in ""The Spanish Prisoner"").  And she lived up to those negative expectations.  It's the coldest, soulless performance I've seen by anyone not Glenn Close.  She has no spark, no emotion.  And when we get to a scene where she needs to call up some emotion, it looks like acting.  Well, she is forgiven for one simple reason: her character is a renowned psychiatrist.  And how does one become a renowned psychiatrist?  By subjugating their own fears and desires, so they can absorb the fears and desires of others.  Crouse's Dr. Margaret Ford never strays from her calculating clinical persona, even when she becomes involved in nefarious events.
The one element that I cannot justify is the finale.  Explaining why would give away the ending, so I'm not going to do it.  But I will say that the epilogue, a cynical recap of the movie's themes, was good enough to wash away any reservations I had.
A couple of words about the things I did like on first viewing.  It was fascinating to see the machinations of the con games.  It gave me the same thrill as when I watch a good Penn and Teller performance.  The abandoned nighttime streets were a nice touch, adding to the loneliness of the characters, though they were probably more a necessity than anything seeing as this was Mamet's first movie.  The con men are all portrayed with style.  Mantegna, an actor who's work I usually don't enjoy, does a nice job.  As does Mamet regular (and real life con game theorist) Ricky Jay.  And even though I figured out most of the ending fairly early, the story was charming and kinetic enough to keep me entertained.",984873600,4,3554,4.696284329563813

792099,5,6304108877,"There are films that are just plain nasty, like almost anything involving Quentin Tarantino.  And there are films that are just plain perfect of their kind.  And there are films that are just nasty enough to be genuinely disturbing,  yet perfect of their kind.  'House of Games' is in this category for me, and I put it loosely in the same shoebox with 'The Usual Suspects' despite enormous differences of style and tone.
House of Games is a terrific exploration of deception, detachment, and control in human interaction.  What's the difference between a clinical psychologist who's a best selling self-help author, and a professional con artist?  Not much, apparently.  This film would be less disturbing if I were able to disagree more with this basic premise :-)
The con artist and the psychologist both stand at a distance from their ""patients"" and analyze them;  both watch for the ""tell,"" the giveaway, the crack through which they gain an advantage and peer into the other person's secrets.  Both have an agenda;  the con artist is going to let you hang yourself by giving you a nice bit of silken rope, and the psychiatrist is going to ""help"" you, or at least pretend to help you, find peace or resolution.  Both are guiding, nudging, pushing, tricking their ""client"" along, with deliberation, towards a goal. Both trade on the confessional urge in people, the need for connection, the hunger for sympathy.  Both make their living off the unhappy, the desperate, the lonely -- and a good living it is, too.
There is so much going on in this film that I felt rather tired after watching it.  There's the truism that psychiatrists are seldom very healthy people themselves -- it takes a rather cold and calculating personality to survive this kind of work, and that's a personality that peeps out from behind the surface respectability and professional pseudo-warmth of our female protagonist.  It's hard to forget the deadpan, affectless authority with which she instructs a disturbed patient to ""put the gun down"";  there is not a trace of fear in her  eyes, no indication that she is not in perfect control of him and of the situation.  Already the viewer must be wondering what kind of person this is.
There's a truism that street smarts will always beat rich-kid smarts;  and this cliche' plays out at first predictably, but then gets overturned.  Who's outwitting whom here?  At first, our con man is calling all the shots.  But his victim is also his protege'e -- in fact, his pretence of making her his apprentice and showing her how it's done, has caught up with him.  She really *has* learned, as he finds out to his cost;  she started out ignorant, but she's smart and she learns fast.
Mamet surprised me several times in the course of the film;  by the time when, considerably later, the red convertible drives away leaving our protagonist desolate by the side of the road, I knew what was up.  But up until that point I had the fun of being surprised more than once;  this is not a one-trick film with a slow buildup like U.S., but a magic show with one card trick after another.
This film was recommended to me highly by a feminist friend despite the obvious ""problem"" plot:  strong, competent, successful professional woman makes idiot of self over masochistic, romantic obsession with wily, low-class grifter.  The ""rich independent woman is really a needy, pathetic little girl yearning to be dominated by lower class stud"" theme is boring as well as offensive, and if that were all there was here, it would be a flick to miss.
What rescues this film from being another 'Swept Away' (or any other D.H. Lawrence dittohead effort) is that our female anti-hero is in fact not pathetic, and not really needy.  She may be temporarily dazzled by body chemistry and the promise of adventure and romance, and there's a lingering longing in her heart for the love and approval of a (hinted) brutal father.  But there's a cool sociopathic core to her personality which makes her a match for the hardened criminal she's keeping company with.  People have criticized L.C.'s acting, and she is a bit wooden, but I think in this case her woodenness works:  it expresses the fatal flaw in her character's personality, a lack of affect, an emptiness, a coldness at the heart.
This is imho a lovely, nasty sendup of the genre theme ""protagonist undergoes adventure and discovers True Self.""  Our protagonist has a wild adventure and she does indeed discover her True Self.  And what a self it is.  Perhaps Mamet's suggesting that it would be just as well if some of us never discover our inner nature :-)  In fact, I don't know exactly what Mamet's suggesting here; rather than a message, a moral, or a motto, this film is a character study, a candid portrait of two characters locked in a power struggle from which only one can walk away.
In general I don't enjoy movies about characters who are all dislikeable.  Perhaps it's a tribute to that genius which everyone ascribes to Mamet, that this film about two very amoral, quite unpleasant people is so fascinating;  it isn't just the clever matryoshka plot that kept me glued to it, it's the dreadful unravelling of a character which at the beginning was apparently integrated with the world, positively engaged, even beneficial; and by the end has reverted, *happily*, to pure predator.
The most powerful scene in the film, for me, was the moment when our damp, bedraggled anti-heroine sneaks into the House of Games one last time, to see the whole cast assembled and reviewing the con.  On the table you can see her ""file"" scattered -- her book, reviews, newspaper clippings, all the research they did on her to discover who she was and how to play her.  Just like her files on her patients... As she glimpses this, she hears her quondam lover quip lightly that sleeping with her was ""a small price to pay"" for the cash they tricked out of her;  and with this casual cruelty you can see her education is complete.
I could describe House of Games as a brutal variation on the Pygmalion story; in fact the play 'Pygmalion' by GBS has a somewhat similar, though less noir, ending;  the girl educated (and bullied) by a condescending and patronizing master profits by her education to defy him and leave him behind.  In House of Games, chilly and very noir indeed, he's left behind dead, and unmourned either by the viewer or our anti-heroine.
Perhaps the greatest riddle of this film is why it's so damned fascinating.  One can make a film about evil people easily enough, and most such efforts are merely unpleasant or outright revolting ('Very Bad Things' comes to mind as something I would never voluntarily sit through again).  But in House of Games, Mamet has managed to fascinate the viewer with the same promise his con man uses to lure in the prey:  come on in, and we'll let you see behind the scenes.  We'll show you how it's done, and you'll be in the know instead of just one of the damn-fool public.  And you know, it works.  We really do want to know which one of these smart, amoral, predatory people is going to win in the end.
Think of it as ""Survivor"" for intelligent audiences.  And perhaps worry a little, about how captivating it really is.",980294400,14,7220,4.709394904458598
792100,5,6304108877,"This is a very intricate movie written and directed by David Mamet. Unlike lesser talents, he can make a convoluted story totally understandable to the viewers yet surprise you every step of the way.  Lindsay Crouse, his then real life wife, played the woman psychiatrist who has just written a bestselling book and become the toast of the intelligentsia in New York. She's also had quite a bit of money roll in from her book. One of her young male patients exhibits great distress and she discovers he is in mortal danger because he owes some big guys in crime a lot of money that he can't pay.  Although she's not supposed to become personally involved with patient's lives, this time she decides to talk to the head man in question and see if she can reason with him for her patient's welfare.

That crime man is played by Joe Matagna who does a tour de force acting job showing every facet of this con man, trickster character.  The psychiatrist is attracted to him and Mantagna can make this guy attractive. But there is no doubt that he can be a very bad guy and an expert con man. You find yourself drawn further and further into the con games going on until they seem like one of those Russian nesting dolls which keep breaking down into yet more dolls.
