8058334,5,B00097E6U4,"This movie is hilarious.  Obviously the other reviewer took this too seriously.  I have had PARTIES based on this movie!  We laugh and laugh!  Years after coming home late one night, this was on the Television.  I instantly threw in a VHS tape and recorded.  Years later i was thrilled that someone took the time to release this on DVD.  AMAZING!  Seriously, you will laugh hard.  The acting, characters, music, setting, it is all great.",1141603200,15,437,4.72
8058335,1,B00097E6U4,"This is a family film that even kids will find boring, I'm sure.  A young boy tells the headmaster at his boarding school that he has met, talked to, and shared Coca Colas with the legendary Bigfoot.  This of course ticks off the headmaster who threatens to have the boy expelled.  The boy hitchhikes home to his father, who happens to be a park ranger charged to find a mysterious beast that is attacking the wildlife.  Next comes a musclebound US Marshal/Big Game Hunter who happens to believe the little boy's tale of Bigfoot.  The movie spends is time showing stock footage of some animals, we meet the kindly lady vet, and the ranger's Indian friend, and little else happens except Bigfoot saves the day and the game hunter gets his just desserts.  It's all poorly written, edited, acted and directed, so don't waste your tears on the wilderness, save them instead for this movie.",1137369600,6,885,4.67741935483871
