4982492,5,B006BZ6YMQ,"Braquo is an addictive series . I recently bought it after reading a review putting it in the same category as Spiral. I watched all episodes over two days I have ordered season 2 . I strongly recommend buying both series and plan on a long fabulous series binge.

4982493,4,B006BZ6YMQ,"Braquo concerns a group of French cops who break every rule and quite a few laws to get the bad guy. Keeping one step ahead of the those within the police who wish to bring them down. Yes you have it, The Shield has come to Paris. However this is no mere French copy of an American original. The main difference between these cops and the Strike Team is that unlike Vic and the boys they do not commit crimes for personnel gain but to catch the bad guys and keep themselves out of even more trouble. Their leader Eddie is also far more likable than Vic. Like the other French cop series Spiral, these cops do not comply with the French image of elegance, black leather and stubble being their look. If you like the tough school of cop drama then Braguo is for you.",1399593600,4,764,4.239726027397261
4982494,5,B006BZ6YMQ,"This series is, according to review, akin to The Wire, which I watched avidly, being pleasantly surprised that an Amercian production could hold my interest !!  However, this is even better in some respects. The storyline is that of mounting intensity. The acting is superb and without ""glamour,"" i.e. ""warts and all !!"" I am an enthusiastic follower of Scandanavian and British thriller/detective productions, and this is an equal parallel in excellence. Would highly recommend this DVD.",1398211200,,488,5.337662337662338

4982496,5,B006BZ6YMQ,"One of the pleasures of 2013 for me was buying a universal region DVD player. Now I can watch discs from France, Denmark, Australia with no problem. ( I bought it new on eBay). So, this is a series about a squad of French detectives who are under cover, or at least plain clothes. They get in trouble with both the underworld criminals and the spineless police brass-no doubt a universal problem. The series follows them through 3 years, but I have only watched 2. Year 3 is $60 plus dollars, and I am just not that ready to part with that much money yet. I do recommend the series. It is not very brutal, can be slow at times, but for fans of this kind of genre-like me-itnis entertaining.",1387584000,6,690,4.315384615384615
4982497,4,B006BZ6YMQ,"Braquo is the story of a group of Paris police officers caught up in an escalating web of coverups and corruption.  Max, Eddy, Theo, Walter, and Roxanne are elite members of the police force.  They operate in that area where the lines between the police and the criminals are sometimes murky.  Unlike what we would call a ""Vice Squad"" here in the U.S., this small group of plainclothes officers deal with crimes from prostitution all the way to homicide.  Their methods, some of which bend the law itself, are very effective.  They are good at what they do.  And they get the job done, that others could not.  As such, they are the tools that are not appreciated, or acknowledged, but are considered to be necessary for the fight against crime.  They're tough, street-smart, and dedicated.

The story starts off with Max interrogating a rape suspect.  Unable to get a confession out of the suspect, Max loses his temper and stabs the suspect in the eye.  The suspect, Bennaissa, is taken to the hospital, Max is taken into custody.  Internal Affairs proceeds with an inquiry into Max's conduct and history.  Dismissal seems inevitable.  Which would mean losing his pension.  During the inquiry, Max commits suicide.  Max was dismissed from service, posthumously.  Because of the circumstances, Max's family are denied his pension.  His squad reasoned out that if they could make Bennaissa recant his testimony and retract his charges, Max would be reinstated posthumously, and the family would become eligible for pension.  They then formulate a plan to sneak Bennaissa, the rape suspect, out of police custody and convince him to recant his testimony against Max.  Wearing masks and armed with shotguns, they sneak into the hospital and kidnap Bennaissa.  The plan was to scare him into agreeing to take back his testimony against Max, and then return him back to the hospital.  They take him to a vacant area outside of the city limits and proceeds to try to intimidate him into retracting his statements, as well as naming his accomplices in the rape.  Just as before, Bennaissa proves to be stubborn and refuses to cooperate.  Theo, high on drugs, loses his temper and shoots the suspect in the head.  Now, the group will have to find a way to coverup the mess.

With an equally corrupt Internal Affairs officer hot on their trail, it is all the four could do to stay one step ahead.  This is a story where all of the characters are grey and suitably complex.  Those who enjoy HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" will enjoy this French import.  Needless to say, this is for mature audiences only.  Highly recommended.",1363219200,5,2609,4.823927765237021

4982512,4,B006BZ6YMQ,"This series starts amazingly, but frustratingly falls off somewhat in the 2nd half of the season as logic starts to breakdown, the main characters do -- and somehow get away with -- ever more outrageous stuff, and coincidence plays a bigger and bigger role.

That said, theres still a lot to like in this exciting French series about rogue cops who are only a bit better than the criminals they chase.  Playing like Sydney Lumets great 1970s and 80s films about New York cops on steroids, this show about a high profile band of morose, angry police whove long since abandoned the rule of order pulls off something quite amazing, which is making you care about these morally almost  but not quite completely  corrupt people.

The acting is terrific, as is the casting.  These cops look like real people, not TV actors, yet still have just enough sexy cool and charisma to ensnare you.  And the show has a look that is edgy and gritty in an effective and exciting way, with lots of camera movement, shadowy lighting and interesting angles (profiles seem as common as head on close ups).

The bad guys in this case are not just the truly scummy criminals our group faces, but also Internal Affairs, who are constantly looking for a way to bring these cops down.  Thats tricky, since the squad is politically popular for getting results and solving high profile cases, so IA cant go after them without an airtight case, which these guys make very hard to do. They know how to cover their tracks.

If only they hadnt felt the need to fill the show with quite so many complex plot lines that don't quite hold up on closer examination, and how can they possibly get out of this moments often resolved in ways that are hard to buy, this could have been a classic.  As it is, its still well-worth seeing.",1415577600,,1795,4.5607476635514015

4982516,5,B006BZ6YMQ,"Wow!  What a series!  I had a different expectation when I first started watching this series.  I thought it would be like - Spiral (Engranages) or like other foreign TV Detective series, but I was so wrong.  This is a deep, dark experience into the underworld of an A team detective group.  This series keeps you on the edge of your seat and shows a blurred vision of who the good guys and who the bad guys are.  Great characterizations, great plots and great action.  It was like watching people fall, fall, fall into a deep abyss and praying that they'll get out alive!  Jean-Hugues Anglade is a wonderful actor that captures your attention in everything he does. All of the actors are simply wonderful.  The character of Theo is one explosive guy! I was so hooked, that I had to order Season 2 right away.  I highly recommend purchasing this season.",1408579200,2,853,4.552631578947368

8496213,4,B006BZ6YMQ,"This French series is quite violent. It handles mature audience subjects, and gives this particular police group a bad name. After you get to know a few of these police officers, you have the same judgement. They are not likable, but have some redeeming qualities. This is a rogue group of policemen who have never been reigned in, and do their own thing.

The four police agents in the Hauts-de-Seine area of Paris are  Eddy Caplan, played by Jean-Hugues Anglade, Walter Morlighem, played by Joseph Malerba, Tho Vachewski, played by Nicolas Duvauchelle, and Roxanne Delgado, played by Karol Rocher. Their colleague Max Rossi was accused of criminal misconduct, and commits suicide. His guilt is presumed by all, except for the other four.

In the first series, the four police decide to do whatever is necessary, to clear Rossi's name.  However, Vogel, of the police internal affairs bureau, an enemy to Caplan is out to get them. The four have personal lives, and we see how they handle their own lives. They are very respectful of their fallen brother's family, and provide sustenance for them. The series is addicting in some odd way.

8496214,3,B006BZ6YMQ,"$$ A note about price $$ Last year I purchased the 3-season Blu-ray set of Braquo for $35 (the cost of shipping included in that price) from Amazon's UK site. If you are able to play Region B discs, consider looking overseas first.

*Comment* If you're not familiar with France, there are some cultural differences to consider when watching a French show about a squad that routinely deals with armed criminals (""braquage"" means robbery in French). Living in the US, it's easy for us to forget that guns are not as commonplace in places like France. The estimated rate of private gun ownership here is 101 guns per 100 citizens (obviously not everyone has a gun, it's just an average), whereas in France it's only 31 guns per 100 citizens. I'm not making a political statement with these figures: this type of data simply informs the viewer of one reason policing differs in different nations. My other comment is that we've had a rough week here in the States with citizens being shot by and then shooting the police. In this review I'm trying to take a neutral, objective stance, viewing Braquo through the lens of an anthropologist.

*Review* There are two types of people in the world, those who love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire/dp/B00UCOXZLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire</a>, and those who love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shield/dp/B00DJYJRHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shield</a>. (Actually there are two types of people in the world: those who think there are two types of people in the world, and those who dont). And then there is Braquo, which throws a wrench into that dichotomy. Although The Telegraph called it ""France's answer to The Wire,"" I think such a conclusion is not only insulting to The Wire, but a wasted opportunity to call it ""France's answer to The Shield,"" which is far more apt (but still not accurate). Braquo is done well, but it's not the work of art some proclaim it to be; while The Shield was a new angle, it was far from a masterpiece.

In Braquo, its clear the screenwriters want us to feel empathy with the quartet of cops who don't play by the rules (cue the piano music during scenes where sympathy is also asked of us). The flipside is that we are fed a parade of mostly two-dimensional, solidly reprehensible villains; due to this (and as a fan of The Wire), I feel slighted by the lazy writing. In The Wire, almost as much screen time was spent following the lives of those on the other side of the law, which made for a rich tapestry when you saw their interactions with other characters and especially the detectives. That said, if Braquo isn't trying to be The Wire (which it probably isn't), then this shortcoming shouldn't be an obstacle for most viewers.

An underlying theme of Braquo is gang culture: the police squad is one gang, and there are several other gangs who are naturally their enemies in the Parisian criminal ecosystem. As with most gangs, the squad members will go to great lengths to protect one another (this aspect is not fiction, it's just the sociology of the badge). What arguably makes Braquo worth binge-watching is an alarming downward spiral as the quartet dig themselves deeper and deeper into precarious situations (after initially ""crossing the line""). The program suggests these ""crooked"" cops are no sociopaths (they seem to have occasional moments of clarity, feeling flashes of remorse and regret from time to time), but instead are simply reacting out of adherence to ""the code"" of a gang (here, the blue wall of silence). The criminals are mostly props or mirrors to reflect the actions of the squad.

A problem for me was a failure of Braquo to instill a sense of empathy with the squad (not for a lack of trying: the actors are decent). Each agent has his or her own personal failures (as we all do), some of them more problematic than others. While they may be ""effective"" as a team, you get the distinct impression too often that perhaps these guys shouldn't have service weapons and a shield. The only character I could connect with was Roxane Delgado, who was practically born into the force and was seemingly the most reluctant to continually cross the line. I watched 6 out of 8 episodes of season 1 over a weekend, but then stopped and lost interest. I'm sure I'll pick the series back up eventually.",1468022400,,4412,4.956756756756757

8496217,4,B006BZ6YMQ,"I can see why reviewers would mention Braquo is reminiscent of The Shield but actually it's quite different fundamentally. The Shield IS the story of entirely corrupt cops, which the viewers are enticed to root for, simply because the characters are rather likeable. The cops in Braquo aren't as ""likeable"" (these guys/gals, do they ever SMILE?!) but they aren't really corrupt per se. Their fall from grace is due primarily to mistakes and bad luck---albeit that requires classifying Theo's use of cocaine, which leads to him stupidly gunning down a suspect, as a ""mistake."" The biggest mistake made in Braquo, actually, is to blindly follow the axiom, which is mentioned more than once, that ""a cop never turns in a cop."" The group could have avoided 4 seasons of endlessly digging themselves deeper and deeper into a hole of criminality if Walter had admitted his gambling addiction and Theo admitted his drug addiction and both of them sought the career counseling which surely is available in the French police.

But then we wouldn't have an exciting crime series to watch!",1442275200,,1078,4.988888888888889

In terms of the story line its very much like ""The Shield""; rogue cops, who dish out punishment to really bad criminals who deserve it and all while their personal lives are train wrecks. These 4 cops shoot guns, drink alcohol, have sex and rarely ever bathe--what's not to like? My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the 'formula' of the show doesn't change much over all 3 seasons. And after about the 10 episode of backstabbing, double-cross, near death shootouts over & over it actually starts to get a little repetitive. You'll have to be quick reading the english subtitles to follow along but really, with all the action you don't much need them to understand the episodes.
