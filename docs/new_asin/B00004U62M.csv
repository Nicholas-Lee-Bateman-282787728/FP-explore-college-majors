1354293,5,B00004U62M,"this show shows off the amazing acting techniques of mary-kay and annie. There characters are riviting and real, and the writing is funny. The parents are losers, but the nanny should win an EMMY! He's great! These episodes are so fun, and you'll watch them over and over again.",1111449600,2,278,4.6938775510204085
1354294,5,B00004U62M,"The twinS growing up before our eyes. And what a great show So
Little Time is..Appeals to all ages..My only complaint is where is the rest of this show..There are still 2 episodes missing from the dvds..Including my fav one where they play sick and then everyone gets sick for real. And there are about 3 unaired episodes. Its been almost a year since vol 4 hope they didn't forget. And the bloppers on here are HILARIOUS too. The character of Maneulo is classic tv comedy character. A laugh riot. And you get to see new sides to the Twins too including rocker metal girls in leather and wild hair just to name one (episode Girls just want to have fun NOTE that episode is on Vol 1).There are many suprises. A JOY all the way around. Get all of this show. Its one of the best shows in years.
I also want to say where is TWO OF A KIND?? GET THIS YOU
WON'T BE DISAPPIONTED AND GET OLSENIZED with solittletime dvdseries......",1074297600,2,922,4.335260115606936
1354295,2,B00004U62M,"I liked the first ""so little time"" tape. In this one I barly laughed. The stories just reapeated themselves. Im not saying I don't like the twins, but the script was alittle lame this time.",1065916800,,189,4.428571428571429
1354296,5,B00004U62M,"I love this show very much. I saw it on TV and it's really, really good. It's really, really funny. I simply cannot understand why some people think Mary-kate and Ashley are just snobs. Personally, I think they are just jealous or plain stupid. Those people, I mean.",1058140800,2,266,4.5625
1354297,4,B00004U62M,"I don't actually own this dvd, but i have seen the episodes over here and they are funny! I had never heard of the twins before but i really like the shows (and their clothes!). I don't know them or anything, but I get kinda annoyed when people say that all of their fans must have no imagination n stuff cuz it just makes them seem jelous of their success. Doesnt their success show that these episodes and movies that they've made must be pretty good and have a high rating? I just don't understand it. Anyway, peace and love!",1040428800,,528,4.29
1354298,5,B00004U62M,"I think Mary-Kate and Ashley are great on this DVD. I really enjoy this new show of theirs and this particular DVD really makes them seem older and it's funny. Plus there are cute boys. Another fabulous point, they dress soooo well and I just really wish I was one of them.",1035072000,3,273,4.269230769230769
1354299,5,B00004U62M,"I wrote a review on Volume One School's Cool from the So Little Time DVD's. This DVD is the best my favorite episode is The New Guy because Riley and Larry show more affection towards each other and it's kind of sad, but funny too. The whole DVD rocks buy it now you won't be disappointed. It's not like the other Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen comedy shows. Although I did wish Two Of A Kind went out on DVD, this one is still a really good DVD!",1031184000,2,442,4.091954022988506
1354300,5,B00004U62M,I think that this is a great idea!  I am a HUGE FANatic of the Olsen Twins and I'm always trying to tape the shows on tapes just so I have them on hand but having them on a DVD is so handy.  You can just click and go instead of pushing fastforward a hundred times and rewind the same!  It's great that they are allowing for their fans to see extra stuff too!  Sometimes you just can't get enough *smiles*.  I highly recommend purchasing this item if you are a fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley or just enjoy the show SO LITTLE TIME.,1029888000,5,526,4.019230769230769

7923670,3,B00004U62M,"So Little Time was a very cute series, I enjoyed it when I was a pre-teen, each episode made me laugh. I think the reason it ended so fast was because there wasn't enough of a long term story line to keep the series going. The mother and father were still obviously in love and the moment they got back together the show ended, and if they didn't angry viewers would make the show end.

I also didn't like the way that Riley treated Larry, he worshiped her and she used him like a tissue. She let him follow her around like a lap dog and then didn't date him. I thought he was cute.

I would still recommend the series.",1372550400,,619,4.107438016528926
