3661217,3,B001JXPCGO,"Outside of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh was probably the most recognizable reggae musician in the world.  His deep baritone voice gave real substance to his songs of rebel cause and social justice.  His talent reached across oceans and different continents. He reached a commercial peak during the late 70's when the Rolling Stones signed him to their record label, after hearing his performance at the One Love Peace concert in 1978.  Mick Jagger introduced him to a nationwide American TV audience, when Peter and Mick sang ""Don't Look Back"", on Saturday Night Live, drawing praise from critics and fans alike.  .  Peter Tosh had a long history in the music circles, dating back to the original Wailers, with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer.  This 3 disc set ""The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience"", is both hit and miss.  The enclosed acclaimed documentary ""Stepping Razor Red X"", is one of the best documents about a pop star that I have ever seen.  The problem that I have with this set, is this documentary is available without this package, which leaves us with a cd of rare and classic recordings, which is good, but nothing that is not available in some other form.  Still it has 14 cuts, with 4 being previously unreleased.  The 2nd DVD,  concert and interview clips, is where this set falters in a big way.  The concert footage is is just awful.  It is grainy 8mm type film in lots of cases, with horrible sound quality, as well as picture quality.  Yes, they are rare clips, but I would say for hardcore fans only.  If you are looking for an introduction to Peter Tosh, I would not start here.  I would buy the DVD ""Stepping Razor Red X"" seperately, and buy ""Honorary Citizen"", a 3 cd boxed set overview of some of his finest work, but by no means all.  Single album releases, such as ""Legalize It"", ""Complete Live"", and ""Equal Rights"", are also a good place to start.  A biography of Peter is due to be published in September of 2013, called ""Steppin Razor', the life of Peter Tosh, which from all indications, will be the definitive story of his life.  Peter Tosh's body of work, although not as popular as Bob Marley's with the masses, is in many ways just as important in the annals of Reggae and world music.  Reggae, to this day, has not recovered from the premature deaths of Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, but they left behind a recorded legacy unmatched by any of their peers.",1363651200,3,2380,4.581560283687943
3661218,5,B001JXPCGO,"It's impossible, to find a documentary or live DVD about Peter Tosh in Germany. So, I'm very proud, of finding this DVD/CD collection in amazon.com. The shipping was very fast and without any problems.

I think, it's one of the best documentary of the life of Peter Tosh. The second DVD contains a lot of sections of different concerts. The quality is sometimes not the best, but who cares.

Also the CD with rare versions is ingenious.",1340582400,,436,4.64935064935065
3661219,5,B001JXPCGO,"I'm very glad I purchased this ""ultimate experience"" box of my hero, the great Peter Tosh. I especially love the dubby versions of Legalize It and Let Jah Be Praised on the CD.  I only have one nit-picky question: How come, on the second DVD, Track Nine is labeled ""Legalize It"" when it is clearly the song ""Bush Doctor?""",1255910400,,321,4.440677966101695
3661220,4,B001JXPCGO,"My hat off to Mr Steffens; rarities, previously unreleased materials (both audio and video)...all that a serious collector would like to have in such a box. The inclusion of the ""Red X"" movie is a nice addition to an already highly interesting package.

My only recommendation (for the future) if I may: the audio tracks' dynamics on the CD are highly compressed; indeed, the tracks are somewhat ""louder"" than what they should have been and that gives a sense of a wrongly-perceived ""better clarity"". That's why I removed one star from my rating.
In any case, the loudness war on CDs is everywhere and highly detrimental to the music.

So Mr Steffens, for a fan of the golden era of reggae and a true audiophile, I would have enjoyed a better remastering of the tracks; for instance, maybe you should have involved the folks at Abbey Road Studios. I'm sure they would have done a significantly better job.

Does this diminish the value of this set ? definitely NOT and, anyone serious about roots reggae in general and the Wailers in particular has to go out and buy this. A true MUST.

Once again, thank you Mr Steffens for your unvaluable contribution in keeping the spirit alive.",1252454400,2,1182,4.695652173913044
3661221,5,B001JXPCGO,"Agreed with Roger Steffen's comment regarding the first 'review' - can't even begin to explain that person's mindset or intentions in chiming in. All I know is that I devoured the Red X DVD even staying up waaaaay too late wanting to finish it... and I wanted more when it was done. I've always been a fan, but both the DVDs gave me (a relative youngster) an awesome view into Peter Touch's life and his art. The documentary indeed showed a complex ""tortured"" man but at the same time someone extremely proud, principled and hardcore in the best possible way. And the concert clips DVD is the next best thing to being there, esp. for someone like me who was just too young to ever see this kind of reggae greatness.

The Rare & Classic Recordings CD is just a cherry on top...

Bottom line: quality + quantity, must-have for lovers of reggae, or anyone interested in a true revolutionary artist in his time.",1240444800,,907,4.524390243902439
3661222,5,B001JXPCGO,"No disappointment in this corner of the globe.  Even though I have owned the first dvd ""Stepping Razor,"" on VHS and DVD and have seen most of the second DVD and have about 80% of the cd tracks, I was still thrilled to see some new concert footage of Peter.  On the No Nukes Concert footage set of ""400 Years"", the box set mistakenly lists the next song as ""Legalize It"" (extended jam version), but it is a blazing ""Bush Doctor"" and ""Don't Look Back""; they were both worth the price of admission.

For those newly exposed to Tosh, after watching the Nicholas Cambell ""Stepping Razor Red X"" you will see how the vampires that Peter fought against eventually get their meal and kill him in cold blood. The Red X tapes were Peter's personal recordings that were later found after his death. I have watched this film many times and the question still remains... There were three men that burst into Peter's home and shot him face down, execution style. One man has been indentified as Dennis Leppo. ""Who were these other two men?""

Roger Steffens' interview excerpts offer a rare glimpse into this Revolutionary Music Man.

Hopefully, this is an indication of things to come from the Tosh estate as some of this rare footage was only previously available through bootleg recordings.  Now if we could only get some more ""full length"" remastered concert recordings.

Peter Lives!!",1239235200,13,1373,4.7196652719665275
3661223,5,B001JXPCGO,"It is despicable that the review previously posted should have been printed here. You ask folks for reviews, not putdowns by someone proudly boasting their ignorance in not watching even one of the two dvds, and not listening to the cd enclosed in this fine box set either. How can you ""review"" something you haven't taken the time to experience.  The two-stars must not be factored into any average of any succeeding postings here, as it is obviously not a valid ""review"" in any way whatsoever.
In fact, the widely encompassing Tosh box contains a vibrant new exposure for the award-winning ""Red X Stepping Razor"" documentary film on Peter's tortured life. It also contains live music performances, including the previously unavailable ""No Nukes"" show, as well as excerpts from two video interviews I did with Peter in 1981 and1983. There is also a cd of music that includes previously unheard Tosh dubplates.  There is very little Tosh in the vaults that has not been released, so this is an important addition to the canon. More importantly, unlike some other Tosh projects available, this one actually pays royalties to the Tosh estate, instead of enriching bootleggers.  Highly recommended for all Wailers' fans.

3661224,2,B001JXPCGO,"I probably didn't read the description carefully enough, but I was expecting an all music DVD and not a documentary. I became bored halfway through the first DVD and turned it off. I haven't played the CD yet.",1236988800,,209,4.526315789473684
