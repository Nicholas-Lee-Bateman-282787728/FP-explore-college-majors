4707596,4,B005I0B54W,My daughter loves to learn how to belly dance.  She's really good at it and is a good excerise for a flat belly,1331856000,,111,3.8260869565217392
4707597,1,B005I0B54W,"Moving one's arms about isn't something super complicated but this video breaks it down sooo much that it's more like a 10 minute lecture followed by 30 seconds of the actual movement.  I don't consider myself impatient but this video was a real chore to watch and I ended up fast forwarding a lot.  I appreciate the ideas and that's what I need, but I wish it was being delivered in a more concise way.  I also have the video by Neon - the Bodylanguage of bellydance. That is by far a better investment and is chock full of arm movements and poses, and gives each a meaning.",1331251200,4,575,4.305555555555555
4707598,5,B005I0B54W,"I am new to bellydancing. As such I never know what to do with my fingers, hands or arms. In class I am so focused on what my feet and hips are doing that my arms are just sorta hanging out there. This video is invaluable. I like the angle of the filming so I can follow from the back which makes it clearer which is left and which is right.  I also like that the pathways all lead to a full combo that is practiced many times over. My favorite section was the drumsolo.  I would love to see Ruby do an entire video on drum solo. I'm not big into the barrel rolls and turns. And if I have one complaint about the DVD it's that her arms are almost the same color as the wall.  So when your trying to focus on detail on the fingers and hands it can be a little hard to see.",1326844800,,771,3.8364779874213837
4707599,5,B005I0B54W,"Honestly, this video exceeded my expectations.  I was totally prepared for yet another skinny minnie to show me the Egyptian Walk, but I was so pleasantly surprised to find Ruby well versed in other genres of belly dance (Turkish).  Her presentation of the lessons were very articulate and contained information for both the beginner (but not a complete beginner...you must have some knowledge of the dance or you cannot execute these moves) and the seasoned dancer.  If you are a seasoned dancer and you do not find anything useful on this DVD, then perhaps YOU should consider teaching.  I have a VAST collection of belly dance videos from a host of top notch dancers, but in my opinion, this one far outweighs the others in every aspect.

One reader claimed the video quality was poor; however, I completely disagree.  Ruby presented the lessons in front of a full length mirror so you could see every angle; the lighting was more than efficient, the instruction was detailed and broken down in easy to follow steps, and the practice sessions both with music and without was a huge bonus!

I loved everything about this video and if I had to make one negative comment, it would be the performance piece...and only because the lighting was a bit poor in this section, but it took nothing from the instructional sections.

I will certainly be looking for more from Ruby and will purchase every one!",1320796800,33,1399,4.775933609958506
4707600,3,B005I0B54W,"I purchased this DVD because I was looking to expand my dance arm repertoire and polish my form. While I think Ruby is an excellent dancer, I was disappointed with this DVD.Here's my breakdown:

This DVD is best for beginning dancers and people who haven't trained/learned basic things yet, like arm placement, simple hand flourishes and want a well taught overview on the subject matter.

 The production values are really not up to snuff with other bellydance DVDs (the lighting in the studio is drab and horrible... Making it hard to concentrate on the lessons) and the camera felt a bit too far off to show good detail of the moves).

The ""frames"" range from good to ""duh,"" with Ruby covering really basic positions that are no brainers. I wish there was a bit more in-depth at look at linking frames up with specific moves or qualities of music (I.e..... This frame is great for when you have a dramatic pause and want everyone to stare at your gooey hip work in taqsim)

The best part of this DVD is the choreography. I really liked her drum solo piece and think its a nice basic dance to learn. Again, nothing hard core or mind blowing, but well choreographed and fun.

In the end, I wouldn't have bought this is I knew it would be so basic in nature and have such poor production values. Was expecting more from cheeky girl, since I love their DVDs. Hoping from A to Zoe is better!",1320364800,12,1389,4.492063492063492
4707601,5,B005I0B54W,"This is such a difficult aspect of belly dancing for many people. This DVD fulfills a real need. Even if you think you don't need it, get it.  There will be something on this CD you will benefit from.",1320278400,5,200,4.128205128205129

8474037,5,B005I0B54W,"I'm not a fan of instructional DVDs.  I prefer going to an actual class, where my form can be corrected.

That being said...I REALLY love this DVD!

Ruby's instruction is clear, and it is easy to see what she is doing.
I've studied belly dance for 12 years, and I was still challenged by aspects of the DVD.

I agree with one reviewer, you should have some knowledge of this dance form before getting into it, but there is something for everyone here.

I love the combinations, and the explanations.

Well done, Ruby, and Cheeky Girls!",1405900800,,535,4.520833333333333
8474038,5,B005I0B54W,"I think this video goes well beyond just arms. Arms are sooooo important when dancing, kind of the way shoes are for an outfit; they make or break it.
I am lucky when I was younger I did flamenco for many years and it really helped me as an adult to just be aware of those two things sticking out of my torso when I dance, lol. This video however, has helped me understand how to better use them along with everything else! the choreo is easy to follow, but not for beginners. There are no explanations of how to do mayas, omis or figure 8's... you need to know those prior to this video. If you don't know what those are than you won't be able to get this dvd's worth as you will need to focus more on the arms, posture and overall grace rather than the actual moves.
The zill part is awesome although I don't plan on playing zills. I played castanuelas and I was never particularly fond of them.",1393891200,,897,4.160919540229885
8474039,5,B005I0B54W,"I love this teaching DVD.. She is a wonderful instructor!!! Easy to understand and follow, yet a great work out.

8474040,4,B005I0B54W,Great video. Shows wonderful arm moves and different ways to use the moves in a choreography. Many of the moves are unique and the video is easy to follow.,1370390400,,155,4.379310344827586
8474041,5,B005I0B54W,Love this DVD! It has a lot of content and some great ideas. I can't wait to use some of them!,1362700800,,94,3.5238095238095237
8474042,4,B005I0B54W,"I have been dancing for 6 years, but my arms were always my weak point. Ruby doe a very good job of giving information in a way in which beginners are seasoned dancers can benefit!",1358380800,,180,4.171428571428572
8474043,4,B005I0B54W,"At one time, a few years ago, we used to yearn for DVDs on arms. And no one would produce any! There were two or three and no single DVD seemed to satisfy everybody. Today it's a different picture. There's a variety to choose from. I have to say from the outset that I would not choose this DVD. Not because it isn't good, but because it isn't based on my favorite style of moves. It's all very Egyptian (If I've got that right) and even set to music that usually makes me leave town. Not my style, not my style. But I know other dancers would choose this video for that very reason. So I'll set aside how I personally feel and pen down my impressions. This is not a review in the real sense of the word, because I've only watched and not actually used the DVD - and I will not be.

Another group of dancers this video is NOT for is absolute beginners. It really is about taking arm work to another level by fitting it right into the dance, not about the basics. Since the arm work is combined heavily with actually dance moves, you have to know your basic belly dance. More than know it. You have to be someone who's well into dancing. I'd say intermediate-advanced. There will be no explaining what a maya is or how to do a turn or a shimmy. You've got to come to this video with all that pretty much down pat.

This whole DVD is full of the type of moves that go with a big fluffy skirt that you can use as muh as you do your own body. Lots of those Egyptian high kicks - that kick and lean back to push up your upper body move - lots of turns with their associated sweepy arm moves, and lots of balance moves. There are passes and kicks sprinkled all over. The arm work is not general purpose and pretty-pretty. Neon's Body Language of Belly Dance would be in that category. So would Bozena's Arm Flow belong in the same category. But this video is unique and almost specialized.

The preliminaries involve posture and a quick section on frames. This isn't about your usual first position, second position but about some typical frames that go with the moves to come along with something on how to transition to them. It's a short but informative section.

Also countable among the preliminaries is a small spell of wrist circles, hand undulations and then snake arms. At this point I was wondering what was the big deal about this video anyway. Actually Ruby could have even eliminated this whole bit, though you need some way to get into the arm work - you can't very well have a DVD with a middle and end and no beginning. Still, it wasn't the best explanation or run through I've seen of either wrist circles or snake arms. It was also at this time that I found myself comparing what Ruby was doing with Bozenka's arm work, not because they're directly comparable but because I've just seen that DVD very recently. Bozenka's is a DVD more suited to beginners, definitely. But the poise of the two dancers is quite starkly different - on the DVDs. I don't know how they compare in general performances and who's considered the better dancer, but Ruby, whom I thought looked wonderfully poised in other DVDs didn't seem to that graceful on this one. But again, that's my subjective impression. As they say ""just sayin"".

The arm pathways are the real meat of the video and  must say, they're very meaty indeed. There are altogether thirty pathways (I didn't count but Ruby said so) and instead of each being a separate bit you can get to from the menu, they're gathered in bunches to fit into three dance formats: slow dancing, finger cymbal moves, and drum solo. Each of these makes a solid separate section with sub sections to explain the basic moves, string them into a combo which is explained, a run-through of the combo with counts (no music yet), practice with music, and finally dancing the combo. That's quite a bit of break down but you really need it as these combos are not easy. Unless you're a pro at Egyptian.

Slow performance pathways are introduced with some impressive tips. Just to tell you one of them: because you're exposed for longer periods, you tend to protect yourself with more closed arm moves. And that's a mistake. Open up to make more expansive moves that'll draw the audience in not close you off. And expansive moves is what you'll do here - lots of arm sweeps, circles, hair combs, arms up to trail down, barrel turn arms, etc. These are not the pretty nuanced emotive type of moves. Unfortunately I happen to prefer those. But anyway, these are arm moves that will almost echo the large movements of a full skirt. There's about as much footwork to do as there s arm work - and that's one of things that's unique about this video. Lots of explanations and tips throughout. I've already described how the instruction is broken up.

You may be surprised, in the finger cymbals section, to see no sign of zills till the end. The thing is, the combo is long and complex. There's just a whole lot to do and while some may want to approach t by using the zills right from the start, Ruby doesn't take that route. I can see why. This isn't about teaching you the basics of finger cymbals and nor is it showing you how to layer basic arm work with zills. It is what it looks like - a big combo into which zills come in. What do you learn? Well, zill-typical arm work! You will probably find something similar only in a choreography video, not one on just zills or just arms.

The moves in the zills section are also sweeps, head roll with arm circles, cross over turns with arms, etc. The combo is again long and involves no end of kicks and balance steps and turns, jumps, drops, hair tosses. I'm a hundred percent sure I wouldn't be able to do it.

It's a solid combo, almost a little choreography, and it'll give you lots to work on for a whle. The zills come in towards the proactive, with no zill explanations except for the counts written on the screen. How you're going to look at the screen while you're turning is up to you!

The drum solo moves also start with excellent tips. For example, you need to pay special attention to no-hesitation moves with your arms else there'll be a very strange difference between sharp hip work and accents, and uncertain looking arm work. That's a great and critical tip! In learning drum solos, one probably focuses much more on the other moves and not the arm work whch is an afterthought. What Ruby says makes sense because you need to put enough work into the arm work as well.

The drum solo combo is also very complex. It's about half a choreography worth of stuff. I'm really thinking they may as well have done full usable ones, but perhaps that's not the objective.

Again, get your balance in order because one-leg moves are used in this mini choreography - and with a drum solo, you could quite easily topple over if you decide to get enthusiastic on one foot!

Phew. There's just a lot of work on this DVD and it can be enough to keep you quite busy. Because of the extensive explanations it would have been difficult to replay the video, but because there are separated practice sessions, working with it again is more easily done.

There's an arm strengthening drill added to the contents here. Exercises with weights that I'm familiar with because I do work with light weights very often. And then there's an ""Arm Puzzle"". And I think I should leave that unsaid so that anyone who wants to buy the video can at least be surprised about some part of the instruction.

Of course, the mandatory (though they all call it bonus) performance is at the end and it does include many of the moves taught and even some of the combos.

I'd give this video a 5 for the amount of content it has, all put together with a lot of hard work. But Ill reserve the right to lop a point off because I hate each of the moves. It's clearly not for everybody and that bit of a waring needs to come in somewhere.",1342742400,8,7880,4.4010989010989015
8474044,5,B005I0B54W,"I had no idea there were so many pathways with arms. This video is a wonderful dictionary of arm positions, poses, and the pathways arms need to travel to get from one frame to another. It is not only a dictionary, Ruby makes sure to explain why you don't want to lock your chest by forcing your arms too far back and other important techniques that people may not have had the opportunity to learn. I look at this video as an opperating dictionary. Very nice job. This video has a bit of stiffness in its poses, but I think it is necessary for dancers who are unable to keep their hands and arms still when they need to. In other words, if you are unaware of how much you are moving those appendages, caught a video of yourself dancing, and said ""oh my God! Why didn't you tell me I was doing that?"" Than this video is GREAT!!! The stiffness and control are needed when correcting a problem like that. Otherwise, I was hoping that the idea of extension would be covered. Great job all around. Very wonderful resource that I will use for years to come. Thank you Ruby!",1341360000,,1068,4.318407960199005
8474045,3,B005I0B54W,"I've seen Ruby perform on video and live several times. Each time she was breath-taking, graceful, masterful, and nothing short of astounding. Particularly graceful were her arms... always poised, always powerful and perfectly placed. This is why I was so excited about this video. The description showed a tremendous amount of material for a variety of levels, and I felt that I would have plenty to keep me busy for a long while with this DVD.

Having gone through the DVD, I wish I had not spent the $20 on it. As other reviewers mentioned, the production quality seemed low, but this was not the most disappointing part. In order to actually get through the moves, the viewer has to sit through a tremendous amount of lecturing. I found myself standing with arms out in position waiting while Ruby chatters about form and dance theory. While the commentary is helpful, it became a chore the second and third and fourth viewing to sit through or have to fast-forward through it. I would recommend having a separate part for tips and technique from the actual drilling, or have a separate voice-over to describe the theory while she drills. That way when I want to drill the moves I can just get to it, which brings me to my next critique. After all the talking the actual drilling of the move is short, making it have very little ""Bang For My Buck"" time-wise. It's a chore to use for drilling. This wouldn't be so bad if the moves themselves weren't so simplistic. A lot of time is spent on rather basic forms. I was excited about the bonus ""Arm Puzzles"", but instead of finding fun and challenging patterns for my arms, I found a tutorial on how to create my own ""arm puzzle"" using the positions she taught. Where I come from, we just call that ""choreography"".

I did come away with some interesting and worthwhile tidbits that I found helpful, but I don't think that overall this DVD is a good investment, which is too bad because I absolutely love Ruby as a performer.",1334620800,10,1974,4.589235127478753
