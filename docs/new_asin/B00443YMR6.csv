8415794,5,B00443YMR6,"Off the break this is a claasic. Im from DC and grew up during the Marion Barry years. He was simply a man for the people. Im a product of the SYEP program which every year gave youth in this city a summer job. Great man, great film a must buy.",1419552000,,244,3.803921568627451
8415795,5,B00443YMR6,"I watched this film on Hulu as suggested by a reviewer. What a powerful story. With all his problems, I don't think he ever forgot about the people he served, nor did he forget where he came from. Can you imagine all this took place near the white house? The power that he had was taken away by a Republican congress, hence DC went back to where it was before Mr Barry. Black Power scares some white people, do you wonder why?",1403308800,,426,4.2073170731707314
8415796,5,B00443YMR6,"A well-designed documentary recalling the turbulent years of Marion Barry's service as mayor of Washington, D.C. Well done and never dull.",1399334400,,138,5.619047619047619
8415797,5,B00443YMR6,"I loved this documentary and I'm not a Marion Barry supporter, nor did I know anything about him until he was arrested for using crack.  What drew me into the movie was how they showed Barry early in his political career trying to make a difference in a community and achieving it for a while...then he fell from grace.  A thought provoking documentary that you can currently see on Hulu.",1393200000,,388,4.5285714285714285
8415798,5,B00443YMR6,"I loved this documentary from start to finish. I saw it when it first appeared on HBO. I even wrote the film makers an email because it was taking them so long to release it on dvd. They show the human side of Barry. And I don't know if they intended to, but the film is also a case study on the flawed way that America handles addiction. Marion Barry was a brilliant political mind. He created the largest black middle class in American history. He created a program that put felons back to work, he engaged minority communities in the process of government in a way no one had before him. All the while he was struggling with addiction. Imagine what he could have accomplished if we invested in treatment the way we invest in prisons? My heart breaks a little for Barry and his loved ones, and the support systems for any addict. This film is a must-see.",1371600000,2,856,4.35625

8415800,4,B00443YMR6,"Marion Berry is a well educated country boy, ghetto and a bourgeoise (Boule')negro member of the AOA fraternity, and Ward8, South East Washington DC the hood loves him, he represents them to a T. Marion is labeled Mayor for life but as most people he has issues, drugs, prostitutes,fast women,etc the DVD did a very good job showing his pluses and minuses, his pros and cons. This low budget documentary's point is well taken .",1294704000,2,427,4.706666666666667
