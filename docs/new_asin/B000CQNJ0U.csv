2470220,5,B000CQNJ0U,"I agree with the previous reviewer: Don't miss the extra feature, which is a  Thich Nhat Hanh's lecture at Berkeley. The philosophy is there; the methodology is there; the spirit is there; the practice is there. You don't need too many ""vehicles/rafts"" to be happy and/or enlightened. And ""the finger is not the moon"". Thich Nhat Hanh is popular for his ""deceptively simple"" words. As in his many books, Thich Nhat Hanh deploys skillful means for us to apply into our daily life. Take the real message and you will get benefited. Don't forget to practice and relax though.",1193097600,3,572,4.777777777777778
2470221,5,B000CQNJ0U,"Moving role model of how each of us can choose to become peacemakers with every step we take.

Thanks to TNH for his many shared lessons ... may everyone be touched by their loving counsel.",1190073600,,189,4.4
2470222,5,B000CQNJ0U,"This is a very well done portrait of Thich Nhat Hanh.  The most important and engaging aspect of this production is that is conveys Thich Nhat Hanh's personality and soul.  This is what I find to be the most transformational aspect of his Being.  To bring this forth so beautifully, constitutes art.

While the documentary covers some highlights from the Vietnam period, the underlying message is really about finding peace in yourself and sharing this in your sphere of influence.  Part of this message is that everything and everyone is interdependent, Thich Nhat Hanh refers to this as ""interbeing.""  In other words, love and happiness by its very nature is intersubjective and individual happiness apart from others is an illusion.

The film also portrays Plum Village, which is Thich Nhat Hanh's headquarters in France.  This is a worldwide retreat center and monastery and the film gives a feel for the day-to-day life of Thich Nhat Hanh.

What I really value here is the portrayal of the inner life of a world famous leader and peace activist.  It conveys the power of love and non-violence that is embodies in this gentle and humble man.

The film is also appropriate for younger people.  While there are vignettes of Vietnam, there were no violent scenes.  I think this makes the film ideal for kids 10 and older.  Thich Nhat Hanh is a great example of the power of vulnerability, sensitivity and gentle persistence coming from a grounded and loving place.  I believe this is a very worthwhile message to convey to our youth and the film length at less than an hour is idea for classroom environments.",1178323200,42,1610,4.824817518248175
2470223,3,B000CQNJ0U,"It was more about the ""Vietnam War"" and less of what I expected in the medication aspect.  It was interesting, just not what I expected.  I love how soft spoken he is and he's calming and soothing to listen too.  Just not the content I expected.",1174435200,11,245,4.282608695652174
2470224,5,B000CQNJ0U,"Everything done and said by Thich Nhat Hanh should get attention from everyone, everywhere.  This man is a saint; a truly enlightened human being.  Buy this DVD and share it with everyone you know.  (His children's books are wonderful as well.)",1172707200,11,244,4.902439024390244
2470225,5,B000CQNJ0U,"I've been aware of Thich Nhat Hanh for about 10 years,have read about five of his books, and listened to a lot of his lectures on tape.

He has a very beautiful message and a pleasant way of presenting it.

I think he's the 'real deal' and he practices what he 'preaches'.

He's a very good speaker and easy to follow because his message is so simple.  Listening to him speak, but more importantly, practicing what he's speaking about could save your life.

He also wrote 'The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching' which is a good book if your curious about that subject.

I'm glad I bought this dvd.",1168473600,21,594,4.4036697247706424
2470226,5,B000CQNJ0U,Peace is every step is especially helpful for those of us who have had some difficult issues to strugle with. It teaches us to come back to the present moment and deal with any given situation.,1168387200,11,193,4.388888888888889
2470227,5,B000CQNJ0U,"I don't recall having ever seen a DVD in which the ""Bonus Extra"" surpasses the feature itself.  But the added ""extra"" is, in my opinion, the ESSENCE of Thich Nhat Hanh.

The biographical main feature is engaging - even beautiful.  But what would you rather see, the biography of a famous painter, or the paintings themselves?  The biography of a famous football player, or the actual film clips of the player in action?  The biography of a famous Buddhist monk, or the actual words of the monk as he describes his practice and teaches us how to incorporate compassion in our everyday lives?

I watched the main feature many times and certainly benefited from it.  But the ""extra"" is more than beautiful - it's transforming.  It seems that no matter how many times I watch it, I keep learning new things from it each time.",1168128000,81,821,4.613793103448276

2470229,5,B000CQNJ0U,Fantastic film and the dvd is extra special because there is a bonus filmed at one of his lectures. Very inspiring,1139270400,20,114,4.476190476190476
2470230,5,B000CQNJ0U,"I like Thich Nhat Hanh and have several of his books, CDs. This book is an insight into human nature and the spiritual path. I also recommend Wherever You Go, There You Are.",1401753600,,173,4.2727272727272725
2470231,5,B000CQNJ0U,Very interesting bio of Thich Nhat Hanh and well done.  I agree with other reviewers that the bonus program is the best part of this DVD.  This man should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize when he was nominated.  I hope to see it happen.,1392249600,,243,4.239130434782608
2470232,5,B000CQNJ0U,"I have liked everything I have purchased by Thich Nhat Hanh. He speaks in a way and writes in a way that the peace in his soul comes out and helps you to feel peaceful and free.  His breathing, exercise and meditation instructions are exceptional. There is nothing you will get that will ever disappoint you. Peace be with you.",1371254400,,327,4.45
2470233,4,B000CQNJ0U,This DVD has a number of parts.  My favorite is simply Thay giving a Dharma talk.  He sits quietly and speaks quietly -- but his words shake be every time I listen to him.  This is one of the best presentations of Thich Nhat Hanh that I have seen.,1353542400,,247,4.0
2470234,5,B000CQNJ0U,"Thich Nhat Hanh transmits peace just with his presence...his teachings and his example are a welcome guidance in a world that can be confusing, hectic and painful. Thich Nhat Hanh gives us practices that lead to more productive lives. I recommend this DVD to every person who is looking for sound human advice; advice that is not charged with a political, social or religious agenda....it is just straight forward sound  advice on how to come home to our true human nature. I am exteremely grateful for Thich Nhat Hanh's generosity.",1344988800,2,532,4.911111111111111
2470235,5,B000CQNJ0U,"Peace and reconciliation are the main themes presented in this interesting and moving video. A simple and humble Buddhist monk and teacher speaks eloquently and compassionatly of the experiences of his people, and of Americans as well, before, during and in the wake of the troubling years of the Vietnam War.

  Thich Nhat Hanh's healing message of reconciliation for war veterans, widows, orphans and refugees is a bright beacon of hope, as relevent in today's world as it was in the 60's. The 90 minute Bonus Feature ""Touching Peace"" gives us an intimate glance into the heart and soul of this modern day St. Francis in saffron robes. It is a truly remarkable and inspiring film.

He has spent the last 50 years telling people of the futility of war, after himself surviving it in his native Vietnam.
Very humbling, peace instilling film.",1234483200,5,209,5.0
2470238,5,B000CQNJ0U,Great introductory film on Thick Nhat Hahn's life.  It will move those who have seen him teaching or read his books and hopefully it will inspire those who haven't just yet.  Here is a real master of compassion and engaged humanity but also a humble monk and meditator.  The DVD offers a narrative about his life and work and a public speech; both equally captivating.,1225497600,2,368,4.630769230769231
2470239,5,B000CQNJ0U,"Peace Is Every Step and the Bonus, Touching Peace, are very different...but, both are good.  You will learn who the man is in the feature, and you will get some powerful insight on war and peace.  In the bonus, Thich Nhat Hanh is your teacher...just like you attended the talk in Berkley yourself.  This dvd has so much healing potential.  I wish everyone could see it.",1201305600,8,369,4.545454545454546
