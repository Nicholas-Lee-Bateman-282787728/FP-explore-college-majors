8378953,1,B002RXM7Q8,Absolutely do not buy this particular video. I bought the Baby Songs and Playtime both by WeSign.  Those are just wonderful.  Babies & Toddlers are instructional videos for adult. There are no follow along songs so you could watch it with your child.,1358726400,,250,4.790697674418604
8378954,2,B002RXM7Q8,"I thought this dvd would be something my daughter and I could watch together to learn more signs.  Boy was I wrong.  She reviews about two signs a minute with no explanation at all and no symbol or picture to show what she is signing.  This dvd is only good for advanced signers who already know a lot of signs.  I simply cannot see how anyone can learn signs this way.  She shows each sign twice, says what it is and then moves onto the next one.  My daughter was completely uninterested in the dvd, which is odd since she loves most things on the tv.  She could have cared less that it was on.

The presentation of the signs are very straight forward and bland which is fine for adults but not for babies and toddlers, which this claims to be marketed towards.

If you want a good signing series look at signing time.  Everything is broken down into smaller parts, there is repetition, music, pictures, other children and babies, and songs. My daughter is captivated by it and gets excited when we put it on.  Each dvd shows you about 20 signs or less which is more manageable than the overload on this dvd.",1310428800,,1109,4.334951456310679
