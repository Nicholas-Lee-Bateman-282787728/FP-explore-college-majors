1802051,5,B000077VTL,"I originally viewed this movie in a theater catering to the liberal elite of Houston.  It is very fair to suspect that few in the audience were of a fundamentalist religious persuasion.  Nonetheless, the consensus opinion of these viewers after the movie were of utter disgust and pity for the pathetic Ms. Chong.  This documentary follows Annabel Chong around as she allows others to belittle and take advantage of her.  She claims to be a champion of sexual freedom and female rights,  but this is not in the least bit convincing.  Never for a moment do we take seriously her pseudo-intellectual rants.  Chong's low self esteem is readily apparent.  Annabel aims to please and personal degradation is a price that she is more than willing to pay.  The porno film makers don't hesitate to cheat her out of money and are carelessly indifferent whether she contracts a venereal disease.  I am utterly convinced that if this were a work of fiction the audience might be tempted to conclude that the story line is a bit over the top.  In this particular case, true life is much more compelling than make believe.
Many of Chong's friends wish to be nonjudgmental and pretend that she is doing nothing out of the ordinary.  Try as they may, these individuals fail to carry it off.  A most telling scene is where Chong tells a platonic male friend that she is a porno movie star and has had sex with hundreds of men.  The young man initially seems to think that Chong is pulling his leg.  We then observe his horror as he realizes that Annabel is not joking.  Eventually Chong's parents learn of her exploits and are rightfully shocked and appalled.  This film is not easy to watch.  Are you looking for erotic titillation?  If so, you will want to avoid The Annabel Chong Story.  This documentary may inadvertently present the best case against pornography ever presented to the general public.  Is pornography a victimless activity?  Even those espousing a very libertarian philosophy will have a hard time answering this question in the negative.  The Annabel Chong Story is ceaselessly sexually explicit and definitely not for the faint of heart.  Almost certainly, this is the only reason why it didn't receive an Academy Award nomination.  It is well worth a few hours investment of your time. Paul Schrader's recently released Auto Focus should also be on the top your list. The latter film indirectly deals with the consumers of Annabel Chong's dubious talents.",1038614400,51,2463,4.821002386634845
1802072,4,B000077VTL,"`Sex: The Annabel Chong Story' is a sort-of-biography of Grace Quek, who under the name ""Annabel Chong"" became a porn star infamous for the ""Greatest ever gang bang"". Despite its title, we don't really discover that much about Chong's story, and the film is flawed in its presentation. But while it probably fails at its main job, it does provide a fascinating and penetrating look at the porn industry, and the way that women within the industry are exploited and degraded.

The biggest flaw here is that we're never given much insight into why Chong decided to subject herself to all this. We are told that she was gang-raped as a teenager, and later in the film Chong has an extended rant against the repressive social culture of Singapore. The message seems to be that Chong's porn career is an extreme form of liberation from these ordeals, with Chong herself spouting the usual clichs about pornography being empowering to women and not exploitative. Here is where I have big problems: Chong is clearly an intelligent young woman, and surely she cannot be so nave as to believe that her pseudo-feminist rhetoric will resonate with male porn viewers. I somehow doubt that most men who watch gang-bang porn would have enlightened views about female sexuality. On the other hand, Chong is clearly not some poor, uneducated type who desperately needs the money. So why does she do it, and what does she really think she's really achieving? Chong herself is not particularly forthcoming, and her comments are often confused and inarticulate. She is clearly emotionally messed up, but was this before or after she got into the industry? We can't say.

The rather haphazard nature of the production doesn't help in our understanding. While there is some interesting material here, it isn't presented in a coherent, logical manner. The film basically throws together a collection of interviews, clips of Chong, pornographic scenes, chats with her family and friends, and discussions about the industry seemingly at random. The large cast of porn directors and actors who wander in and out of the film don't contribute much either. Predictable lines about Chong's orgasms and reactions being 100% real (yeah, right) are trotted out, plus some half-hearted pleas for pornography to full legalised and accepted as legitimate art. The attempt by these guys to portray their craft in a positive light is particularly ironic, given the bleak picture this film paints of the industry.

While there are plenty of explicit scenes, `Sex..' is certainly not titillating. In fact, the overwhelming emotion from this is sadness and despair. Whether Chong really was nave enough to believe she was making a feminist statement, or was so messed up she didn't know what she was doing, her pornographic career didn't bring her happiness, and it certainly didn't bring her respect. After her ""gang bang"", established porn actors regarded her as an upstart who was too stupid to take precautions against STDs, while directors simply saw ways to exploit a woman who would do almost anything on-screen. Chong is clearly depressed, uncomfortable and humiliated by the whole experience, and her claims that she ""doesn't care"" and ""loves what she does"" are so transparently false they're almost painful to witness. And involving Chong's mother the way they did amounts to little more than a cruel joke; it's deeply unfair to Mrs Quek and should have been left out.

So despite its flaws and its overwhelmingly downbeat nature, `Sex...' is still interesting for the unflinching look it takes at pornography. Seeing the way Chong is chewed up and spat out by the industry, only to have her come crawling back for more, is brutal and heartbreaking. While probably not intentional, this film manages to be the best anti-porn message out there. If someone as intelligent as Chong can get used and abused as badly as she does, it makes you wonder how other actresses fare.

Sex: The Annabel Chong Story is one of those documentaries that could have been made much more professionally; it tells Annabel's story well but not as well as it could have. There are gaping holes in the story: for example, at one point in the film Annabel is raped by a gang of men and you can tell she is emotionally scarred by it. However, it gets little more than just one or two minutes of footage with very little voiceover by Annabel. However, the clips from her adult movies never seem to end; I often felt I was watching something more along the lines of an adult film instead of a documentary about this young lady!

In actuality, Annabel Chong's real name is Grace Quek. Grace was born in Singapore; and we first meet Grace after she has changed her name to Annabel Chong to make it in the adult movie business. Annabel is interviewed quite a bit and comes off as manic or having some attention deficit disorder at times; she often looks around at all angles as she speaks while avoiding looking into the camera or at the person interviewing her. We also see her remarkable drive to break a world's record for having sex with men--251 men, in fact, in just 10 hours--more than double the world's record which had been made by a ""sex worker"" in Amsterdam, Holland.

Annabel has her work cut out for her. Will all the men she has contact with be properly tested for HIV? It turns out that not all of it was ""safe;"" and ultimately Annabel must go for an HIV test that actually doesn't seem to faze her too much. Of course, when Annabel returns to Singapore to see her parents, she may want to finally tell at least her mother what she's actually been doing to finance her way through college. How will her mother take all this? And, if Annabel is to honor her mother's wishes, why does she return to the adult movie industry? We're left merely guessing; and that's something I don't like.

After all is said and done, however, the movie goes along at a pretty good pace and even with so many unanswered questions that would have made this truly special, you won't exactly get bored unless you're easily offended by the adult movie industry--and in that case you shouldn't watch this movie. We do get a very good sense of what Annabel's life was like when we meet some of her friends, in particular Alan, onscreen. We also see what Singapore is like when Annabel returns to her parents' home for a visit. Wow, Grace could never have stayed in Singapore; she was too different for that society.

There is bonus footage about Grace as well.

Overall, Sex: The Annabel Chong Story isn't a bad documentary; but I've seen much better documentaries. We essentially see a young woman driven to deal with her issues by having sex with as many men as possible and make a few bucks in the adult movie industry although she was never fully paid at least according to this film. I recommend this for people interested in these psychosocial issues.",1247443200,,2956,4.505597014925373
1802075,3,B000077VTL,"I came across this movie and it jogged a memory.  I'd read this in the local arts weekley that Annabell Chong was coming to town to show her documentary and be there for a Q & A session afterwards.  Having never met her (and still not wanting to meet her), I wondered why would someone want to star in the adult film industry let alone have sex with 251 men in less than 10 hours.  She set a new world's record, outdoing (no pun intended) a sex worker in Amsterdam.  What exactly is the point of doing this?  I didn't know before and still don't know why afterwards.

Girls who star in porn movies are pathetic.  Annabelle is no exception to this.  She tries to come off as making some kind of pro feminist statement that she is having sex with so many men.  What kind of statement?  That she has no fear of AIDS?  That she thinks so little of herself to preform on camera with not just one but all these others?  Some may say ""it's just work"".  Per Ron Jeremy, he assured the audience that all the guys participating were wearing condoms and had been tested.  Is that supposed to make me feel better?!  We only saw hints of the real person.  Is she hooked on drugs?  Was she ever forced to preform on camera against her will?  Why does she keep going back, because she's ashamed?  The possiblities are endless.  And she said if she did get AIDS she wouldn't be sad, because she had an experience.  I hope no one takes that seriously.  But guess what?  She's a cutter.  She wants to feel something, release the pain inside.

Perhaps the scariest aspect of this is the unassuming interviews with her mother.  Her mother clearly has no idea she is doing this.  What would her reaction be?  Would she even acknowledge that she knew her?  What is she supposed to feel?

This is a haunting look at the realities of porn.  A must see for anyone who thought it was glitz and glam.",1221004800,2,1873,4.311239193083574
1802076,4,B000077VTL,"I saw SEX - THE ANNABEL CHONG STORY at a film festival when it first came out and, happily, Chong herself was there for a Q and A afterwards.  The movie itself explores the interesting, and often contradictory, personality of Annabel Chong.  Born Grace Quek into a traditional family from Singapore, Chong had, as it seems, a taste for something a whole lot more.  The film tries to get at exactly what it is that drives a woman to gain infamy as the receiving end of the world's biggest gang-bang.  Given the type of person who would aspire to such, it is not surprising that it does not quite succeed despite an admirable effort.

Chong comes off as troubled at times (she cut her arms with razors at one point), but, as a whole, more put together than coming apart.  Pleasant and appreciative of her fans, she seems to have a decent sense of the moral quandries of her actions.  The scene in which her mother discovers her daughter's true work is particularly tough.  And the actress who breaks Chong's gang-bang record is so nasty and self-centered that Chong cannot help but seem like a decent person if only by comparison.

Chong never achieved true fame through porn.  Her name is not as well known as, say, Jenna Jameson or Tera Patrick.  But her films are so wild that she gains in notoriety among those who do recognize her what she lacks in name recognition.  During the Q and A she seemed nice though a bit overwhelmed in front of so many people and being peppered with (for the most part friendly) questions.  SEX - THE ANNABEL CHONG STORY is worthwhile for those interested in a bit more backstory to the porn scene.",1204416000,4,1630,4.522184300341297
1802077,4,B000077VTL,"What makes this movie work is the unique character known as Annabel Chong. Actually Annabel Chong is the ""porn name"" of a young USC student named Grace Quek. Grace grew up with a religious family in the ultra conservative society of Singapore. Apparently Grace began to rebel against these strict social conventions, especially after being exposed to more permissive people and cultures in London and California. Grace was a serious student who was seeking to combine her feminist perspective with her intense interest in sex. She became famous by appearing in a porn movie where she had sex with 251 different men in a 10 hour period.

Grace is clearly an intelligent woman who was attempting to push the sexual boundaries (and buttons) of conservative society. She was also someone with ""issues,"" as made clear by her admitteded drug abuse, weird mannerisms and inarticulate ramblings. Quite likely she was still getting high while this film was being shot. But yet I found her to be an interesting person. Remember she was just a college kid and an especially adventurous one at that. She was also someone who wanted to experiment with her sexuality outside of what mainstream society considers acceptable. Of course, a woman having sex with so many different men is disturbing to most people. But I think that is exactly what Grace wanted to do, to ""disturb"" people and to challenge the social stigma against the free and full expression of wanton female sexuality in its most extreme form. So, personally, Annabel/Grace I commend you for your courage!

My primary complaint with the movie is that Gough Lewis is a pretty mediocre director. The documentary seems to lack a clear storyline or purpose and is instead just a confusing mishmash of different scenes thrown together. Not enough attention is devoted to explaining Grace's past or why she wants to do the ""gangbang"". Also on the bonus documentary, which was filmed 4 years after the movie, Grace complains that Lewis included certain scenes out of context. For example, the original film shows a scene of Grace mutilating her arm with a knife and makes it seems like this is something she does on a regular basis. But Grace says she only did this on a single occassion, the day that she and the director broke off their romantic relationship, and that he not only encouraged her to do this but took part in the self-mutilation himself.

In any case, I'm curious whatever became of Grace. This world doesn't always treat it's weirdos and extremists all that well. But hopefully she is doing OK. Whatever your opinions on the actions of ""Annabel"" this is still a movie well worth watching.",1180742400,3,2650,4.884444444444444
1802078,3,B000077VTL,"This documentary tells, in a rambling, confused style, the story of Annabel Chong, the woman who participated in 251 sex acts in 10 hours.

Although not being a fan of the porn genre, I have always been curious to understand why people would choose to give their working lives to such an appalling industry. This documentary - in a fragmented way - gives a suggested explanation in Annabel's case.

Grace (Annabel's real name) was brought up in a fairly strict, but loving, family in Singapore and given a first-class education. She then came to London for a brief period to further her studies. Tragically, there she was brutally sexually attacked by multiple assailants. This seems to have set her on a new course in life: looking for something to alleviate her pain and come to terms with what has happened.

She then decides to study sexuality, in particular ""female empowerment"", at USC. I have since learnt that Grace was reading Law in England, hence this represents a radical step - something the documentary-makers completely fail to discuss or even mention.

This quest for empowerment leads to her misguidedly seeking sex with as many men as possible. It's only a step from there to the notorious ""gang bang"" movie. Of course, the men who run the Californian porn industry are delighted to have such a promiscuous and hard-working ""talent"" on their hands and go out of their way to exploit her apparent enthusiasm.

After the event, Grace clearly has not found the sense of self-worth she was looking for. Quite the reverse, she descends further into harm and unhappiness; the most upsetting scene of all is when her mother finally finds out what she has been up to in the States.

Don't watch this film if you are looking for titillation. It is one of the most distressing, least sexually exciting films ever made. And expect to come away with more questions than answers.

The story of this woman is a wake-up call to anyone who thinks that porn is just a bit of harmless fun. It's just a shame the producers weren't more committed to their subject.",1153008000,8,2062,4.759103641456583

( after all, dating the main subject of the doc may sku things wrong.) She is a beauty in an unconventional sense and as far as I am concerned she is right.

  A guy bangs a thousand women and he is to be looked at as a special significant player. A woman admits to having sex with more than one man and she is human filth. We have a double standard that should be burned away in our society.

The fact that Ms. Quek is a voting member of society now and a republican to boot, should give all fair warning that to pigeon hole her would be a vast mistake.",1134172800,4,720,4.013986013986014
1802080,4,B000077VTL,"This is the story of Annabel Chong surrounding the record setting ""Worlds Biggest Gang Bang"". I was hoping to see more of her carreer in the porn industry and her personal life. Instead of just dealing with this one, although big, event of her life.

The extra with Annabel answering questions about this film when it opened, where in my opinion too short. I would like to of seen her answrer a few more questions.

Over all, I would recomend this to others. As documetries go, this does hold your attention to the story.",1128297600,2,521,4.531914893617022
1802081,3,B000077VTL,"You could make a powerful argument that this film belongs on the reading lists of most abnormal psychology classes. The life of the poor, disturbed, and massively depressed Annabel Chong is displayed and its sight is repulsive. Her misery is so profound that it created feelings of deep empathy within me; which I never believed would be possible based on the fact that she is a radical feminist icon.

Speaking of radical feminism, here we have irrefutable proof that the ideas spat about in the universities have major repercussions in the outside world. Chong has been educated, or indoctrinated as it were, in the art of womyn's studies while at USC, and we hear her rail--between the tears, self-mutilation, and exploitation--that she is ""constructing a new sexuality"" by having sex with all comers. Chong's anxiety and depression are impossible not to notice. She speaks occasionally with bravado of how she is no different than men, but it is the porn star we see cutting herself with a knife begging to actually feel something in this life. Her promiscuity even leads to her being raped in London, and, in true masochistic fashion, she goes back to survey the scene with a camera. It is a miserable sight to behold. She is universally reviled as, somewhat astonishingly, even porn stars look down upon her and express views that she is a disgrace. With having to deal with such hostility from society, only the coldest of hearts can resist pitying her.

This documentary should be re-titled ""Sucker"" because it is the most descriptive term with which to describe the beaten down Annabel Chong. She has bought into the feminist dream and the result is anxiety over AIDS transmission and a body drenched in seminal fluid. Who was liberated through her permissiveness? For one, the producers of her films. They took her for $10,000 via her participation in the biggest gangbang ever. She did all the work (251 guys!) and received nothing more than endless worries about disease.

Annabel's real name is Grace and she expresses the opinion that the United States is a repressive society, yet it is in her native Singapore where she is truly not accepted. Her vocation shames her mother, and yet another scene is shot in which Chong is crying. She promises her mother to make her proud one day, but the audience knows that day will never come. Like a mentally retarded child she has practically no understanding of the workings of the world around her.

Thirty minutes in, I craved for this one to end as I could bare no more of Chong's suffering. As always, there is a law of unintended consequences, and the beneficiaries of the 40 year feminist crusade against human nature are the Ron Jeremy types who profit off her denigration as if she were 1990 options of Microsoft.",1123113600,8,2777,4.8277310924369745
1802082,3,B000077VTL,"Anyone looking in this film for an empowering tale of women's sexuality or a cautionary tale about the evils of women's sexuality will be disapointed.  All you get here is a portrait of a girl, sexual and empowered, used and vitiemized, all at the same time.  This film is about her contrdictions.

She is a liberal feminist who gets into porn to showcase her sexuality, but the porn industry degrades her.  In some ways, she lets herself be degraded.  Her repressive Christian background certainly seems to be playing into it, she seems to be wanting to run in the opposite direction from Singaporian respectability.  What starts as a strong positive message about sexual double standards and female sexual empowerment gets lost as gets deeper into the business, which seems to cause depression to set in.  Maybe she was naive in her goals, but the porn industry lies to her (telling her all her partners have been HIV screened), refuses to pay her, and in the end brushes her aside for the next fad.  So what you're left with is a story about the contradictions.

Anabell Chong is intelligent, but makes some really bad calls.  She's empowered but also kinda messed up.  She's articulate but sometimes you wonder if she really means what she says.  She conforms to a very idealized image of Asian beauty for her work, but spends most of her time in a slovenly apartment with a shaved head.

1802084,3,B000077VTL,"A critic once said that this movie was ""....like a car crash on the motorway, you can't stop yourself from watching"" - this summarizes it very well. Sometimes its painful to watch (mainly due to the undignified acts Annabel puts herself through) and the movie itself is not that well structured (jumping from segment to segment in a fairly random way). But, the story being told here is fascinating in a ghoulish, extreme-reality tv kind of way - and consequently makes riveting viewing.

Why did she do it ? How did she get to the stage in her life when she wanted to do this ? These are the questions that viewers are seeking the answers for, and of course there is no clear answer - just stories and images from which we are left to make up our own mind.

The film is a fly on the wall style documentary of Annabel before, during and after the world's biggest gang bang. There are interviews with her mother, her friends, her teachers and herself giving a mosaic (at times random) view of her life. Sometimes the film is a traditional interview, sometimes just as a passive eye on the proceedings and never does the film pass any judgments directly in a Michael Moore fashion - and this style works well for this movie.

My opinion is that there is also a bizarre mask about what everything she says and does, that makes me think she is not being honest even with herself, for example :
- she claims to be having the time of her life during the act itself but eventually has to give up due to internal injuries and the line of the most ugly wannabe porn stays taking their place in the queue surely could not be much of a turn on (or could it ??).
- she does not get paid her $10,000 for the whole event but claims she did not care about ripped off for the whole thing, cause she wasn't after the money.
- Finally, she says that if she catches AIDS out of the whole thing then so be it and considers it an occupation hazard.

After statements like these I found myself shouting at the television telling her to sort herself out and to look at the reality of what she was doing. So if a good documentary produces a strong reaction in its audience - then this one is pretty reasonable.

I see on her web site, she has abandoned her porn star persona and is now making a good living as a computer geek. Good for her - I hope she is very successful - you could say it was inspirational to see have a crazy lifestyle while younger and then and successfully reinvent themselves.",1100044800,6,2475,4.302575107296137

Unfortunately, with such great material the filmmaker doesn't do a good job.  First of all, this documentary is just like an Annabel Chong Home Video collection done by the ex-boyfriend (which is what the director was).  It follows all her through her daily and not-so-daily life and nothing more.
Never does the filmmaker ever ask ""Why?"" Why does she do this? How has her past trauma (being gang-raped) affect her (it barely even acknowledges the rape)?  Why does she go back to porn after promising her humiliated parents to make it up to them?  It just lazily notes these things and moves on to her going around and doing her daily tasks.
Worse, at times it misrepresents Chong.  There's one scene where Chong is cutting herself without explanation.  Wow. Screwy, right?  Except in the BONUS MATERIAL, you learn that that's the scene when the director breaks up with her and SUGGESTS they take turns doing cutting themselves and films it.
The filmmaker may be incompetent but that's not to say the DVD isn't interesting.  With a life as... complicated... as Chong's it's hard to make it boring.  The most moving part is when she moves back with her parents in Singapore and they discover from strangers her secret life has having being the center of the world's biggest gang-bang.

What was she trying to prove?
Off I went to find out with a very open mind willing completely to forward my sympathy to a woman who did something so maverick, if nothing else. Unfortunately, the answer never came.
For one thing, it would have helped the creators of this putative muss to have at least gotten their own act together. We are first told that the whole motivation behind this supposed expression of female empowerment was an ""ultimate ego trip"" ...to have all these men wanting to have sex with Chong.
A few minutes down the line, we find out more about her sordid past which included, lo and behold, a teenage sexual assault (gang r*pe) and drug abuse, the obvious implication being that this drove her into promiscuity.
Which is utterly unconvincing in its own right, but as though this were not bird-brained enough we are then presented with an interview with Ms. Chong on channel 4's ""The Girly Show"" (clearly a benchmark for intellectual debate now isn't it?) talking about how it was ""a p*ss take on the whole western ideal of masculinity"" or how she felt that it ""was an artful expression"".
Right. An*l hand-jobs and ""triple penetrations"" - how very vintage Da Vinci!
In the end, this 90 minutes of burlesque gibberish leaves the viewer sighing. This is NOT a look at sex or any offshoot thereof as seems to be promised from the title, but a look at the psyche of Annabel Chong and the only thing it ends up conveying is that she is one troubled human being. Playing neither the role of a defiant punk slut rebel or a vulnerable woman-child entirely convincingly, she ultimately comes across as a very confused young woman desparately scrambling for an identity.

However, the shock value of the film's central focus eventually wore off, and the filmmakers-- intentionally or not-- leave us with a portrait of a woman with a uniquely admirable quality: Miss Chong shows herself to be unapologetic about her passion for sex (incidentally, with both men AND women), is completely intergrated with the sexual side of her personality, and has no regrets about her astonishing act-- even though she faced an HIV scare afterward, and got stiffed (no pun intended) for the $10,000 salary that she was supposed to receive for her work in ""The World's Biggest Gang Bang."" Annabel Chong, of course, is not the first or only person in the world who has expressed her sexuality and sexual desires without apology. At the risk of portraying an adult film star as a role model, however, Miss Chong's comfort level with her sexual attitudes and activities is refreshing. Her honesty and freedom of expression form a sharp contrast in our society where even as we slowly break down barriers dealing with sexuality, confronting our sexual behaviors and activities still remain a potential source of conflict (both internal and external) to us. It's debatable over whether Annabel Chong's life warrants an 86-minute documentary-- but nevertheless, this is fascinating stuff.",1042588800,10,1745,5.191489361702128
1802089,4,B000077VTL,"The Vidiot is making one of his regular visits to the video store when he spies this in the new release section. A highly acclaimed doco about a 22 year old College student who decides to have sex with 250 men over a 10 hour period to break the record for the World's Biggest [love fest]. At seeing this The Vidiot assumes his not-so-famous Roger Moore acting position- right eyebrow raised, left eyebrow raised and then re-reads the video slick. Yep, his eyes did not fail him. Being the lover of controversy he is, and with his interest in the darker side of human nature he rents it.
First I'll make one thing clear: This is not a porn movie. Those of you after cheap thrills can get your fix elsewhere, this may change your ideas on pornography forever.
Annabel Chong is the stage name for Grace Quek, a humanities student who decides the break the WB[love fest] record. The viewer is never given a good reason as to why she chooses to do it, just a multitude of [weak] excuses about being a powerful woman. To any normal person, being filmed having sex with 251 men you don't know is not the way to go about being a normal person. It's just downright sad. Quek tries to have us believe that she is a strong woman in control of her destiny, but even the most gullible person won't be fooled. There are scenes of Chong self mutilating, her family's heartbreak when she tells them what she does, and the utterly sad and pathetic scene where she inevitably turns on even the film crew making the documentary, eventually seeking comfort in the arms of a porn director who specialises in rape videos. Yuck.
SEX is endlessly fascinating, as well as being emotionally draining. You won't want to see this picture more than once but you should see it. But be warned it's not for the faint hearted and is definately NOT recommended for anybody under the age of 18 (or 17 depending where you live). However there is one memorably amusing scene of ...actress Jasmin St Clair verbally abusing some stupid dolt while trying to break the Gang Bang record.",1041897600,18,2045,4.52972972972973
1802090,3,B000077VTL,"This documentary supposedly tries to give an insight in the life of Grace Quex aka Annabelle Chong whose most famous achievement was to participate in the first biggest-ever [lovefest].
I was expecting to find out what her motivations were for participating in such a degrading thing, but no answers are given. She tries to steer random pseudo-feminist explanations that are just not credible. As always, the viewer concludes that the sole reason for people wanting to go to the porn industry is that they are simply losers who don't know better. I would have been glad to find other reasons given in this documentary, but they just weren't there.",1039132800,4,647,4.944954128440367
