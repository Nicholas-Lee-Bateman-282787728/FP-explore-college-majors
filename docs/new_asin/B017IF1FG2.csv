8739406,5,B017IF1FG2,"This DVD program was designed to teach kids how to block attacks from bullies and schoolyard fights, without being suspended from school. By showing examples of all the different types of martial arts blocking moves that can be used, the program aims to keep your child out of trouble when faced with a bully's attack. In this day and age when being bullied can cause great physical and emotional harm, anyone who comes up with a program such as this one may potentially save lives. Kids of any age and size can be taught these basic blocking moves, and the parents are also advised to practice these moves with their kids in order to sharpen their reflexes and co-ordination. Instruction in how to construct a home made bow-staff like item is also shown, to aid in the practice of blocking blows from said staff, which is padded to help prevent injury when practicing. This should also be done under adult supervision. In summary, I feel that this program would be a helpful addition to anyone's skill set when it comes right down to it, because bullies will never stop bullying, and we must teach our kids how to deal with them in the real world. If I may add a link to a short video demonstration here, titled Little Kid Fights Off Attacker on you tube, you can see for yourself. https://youtu.be/cpvp3q_tnE",1446940800,,1310,4.650862068965517
