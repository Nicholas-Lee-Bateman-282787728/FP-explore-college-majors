He knows his alphabet (both visually, verbally, and in ASL) now, thanks to these videos. Plus, watching these with him gives us both a way to have fun learning and interacting. Being a stay-at-home mom, this helps keep my mind active as well. This video is all about sports and he gets so excited to practice kicking and shooting hoops after watching.  Can't say enough amazing things about the entire Signing Time series!",1431388800,,521,4.5212765957446805
8236066,5,B000ZN71Q8,"This DVD had become our recent favorite! The theme song is catchy and creatively includes all the sports vocabulary. Great videos of kids playing soccer, baseball, football, and basketball. The game at the end is my daughter's favorite and she likes to quote the lines throughout the day. We love Rachel, Leah, Alex, and  of course Hopkins!",1404777600,,340,4.964912280701754

8236070,5,B000ZN71Q8,"Purchased this DVD to help my students understand the signing of a classmate. We all enjoy the many Signing Time DVDs, they are topic specific, last about half an hour. Real children are shown signing, so children have many opportunities to read the signs on other children's hands.  Very beneficial to us. Purchased used in excellent condition. This DVD covered most of the common sports in schools and communities.",1336089600,,416,5.028985507246377
8236071,5,B000ZN71Q8,"My 3 year old daughter loves Signing Time videos and has been watching them since she was 2.  She loves this one and has learned many signs and also learned about the different sports.  She sings along, signs, dances and throws her (indoor ;)) ball while watching.  A hit!  Only wish they were less expensive.  Great learning tool and fun!",1334102400,,339,4.583333333333333

8236073,5,B000ZN71Q8,"We have all of the Signing Time DVDs.  I've purchased 4 other companies sign language DVDs and none of them can hold a candle to these.  The songs are fun, the signs are easy to understand, the graphics are bright and cheerful, they use children of all abilities, they have poured their hearts into these episodes and it shows.  My son brings them to movie day at school and the kids choose to watch these over Finding Nemo, Cars and the teachers love them.",1208563200,,457,4.416666666666667
