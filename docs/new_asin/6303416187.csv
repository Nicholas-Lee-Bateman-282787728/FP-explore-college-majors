7847172,5,6303416187,"This is the best cartoon I have seen in years.  It is the movie that started all the insect movies.  When watching it you see a lot of the Ideas that are used in both ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"".  This is a must for anyone that has children, or just wanting to see a good cartoon for a change.  This movie is great for all ages.",999475200,,326,3.8208955223880596
