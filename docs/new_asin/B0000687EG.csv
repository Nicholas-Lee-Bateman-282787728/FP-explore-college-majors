1722670,5,B0000687EG,"The cream of the Broadway Theatre Archive, this production has it all--the stories of Anton Chekhov, Neil Simon to mold the stories into exquisitely timed and hilarious theatre, and a cast that is hard to duplicate.  Starring Marsha Mason, who plays everything from a maid to a lady of the night; Ed Asner who is a terrific,  blustering general; and Lee Grant, who ranges from a wily and assertive employer to a wild woman with a ""nervous disorder,"" the production also includes Bob Dishy, who has an elastic face and expressive eyes, starring in ""The Sneeze"" and ""The Seduction,"" and Gary Dontzig as the ""Drowned Man"" and a 19-year-old son about to be introduced to sex for the first time.

The seven Chekhov stories which become one-act plays here are filled with dry humor, surprise endings, and clever common people in confrontations with ""superiors"" which end in absurdity.  ""The Sneezer"" cannot apologize enough to the general who is his boss at work, then believes that he himself has been humiliated.  In ""The Governess,""  an employer (Grant) tricks a subservient governess (Mason) out of 80% of her pay.  ""The Seduction"" shows a man-about-town (Chamberlain) using a husband as the conduit for his seduction of the man's wife, a story with a twist at the end.  ""The Drowned Man"" (Dontzig) claims to be in the ""maritime entertainment business"" and will ""drown"" for a small fee.  ""The Defenseless Creature"" gives Grant her star turn, and she is hilarious as the clever wife who wants money from a banker (Chamberlain), threatening him with a curse if he refuses.  In ""The Arrangement"" a father takes his shy, 19-year-old son to a house of ill repute, then realizes that the son will no longer be a boy.

The most stunning episode is ""The Audition,"" and anyone interested in acting would do well to study Marsha Mason, who is magnificent here.  Playing the parts of all three sisters from the conclusion of Chekhov's The Three Sisters, she is sensitive, bursts into tears on cue, then becomes rational and straightforward.  As Mason convincingly plays the three different roles, one witnesses a truly great acting moment.  Each of the scenes is beautifully produced and sensitively acted, and the viewer comes away from the production awed by Chekhov's writing, Simon's dramatic sense, and the ensemble cast's incredible talent.

I wanted it on DVD but like many of them that I have ordered they played once and never again or not at all.

7963820,4,B0000687EG,"Neil Simon wrote this play starring Richard Chamberlain, Ed Asner, Marsha Mason, and Lee Grant, which is made up of seven independent comic vignettes based on stories written by The Good Doctor, Anton Chekhov. Richard Chamberlain plays Chekhov and acts in most of the main parts. The stories include:

The Sneeze is about an employee who happens to sit behind his employer at a play, tries to impress him, but then accidently sneezes on his head. The employee is flabbergasted and, although the employer reacts in an understanding forgiving manner, goes overboard in trying to seek the employer's pardon. He behaves to his disadvantage.

 The Seduction concerns a seducer who shows how to seduce another man's wife by having her husband tell her all the praises that he says about her.

 In The Drowned Man, a man gets Chekhov to agree to pay to see him jump into the water and act as if he drowned. The man cannot swim.

 The Arrangement is a tale where a father takes his nineteen year old son to a prostitute as a birthday present and bargains with the prostitute to get the best price. This is his son's first experience with sex.

 The stories are clever and humorous, but Chamberlain seems to act as if he were in a Shakespeare play.",1278288000,4,1239,4.646788990825688
