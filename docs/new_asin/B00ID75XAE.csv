6259286,5,B00ID75XAE,"Four of Marilyn Monroe's finest films, all comedies, in an easy-to-afford collection.  In a nutshell, they are:

GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES (1953) - This musical was adapted from an older play and stars Marilyn and Jane Russell enroute to Paris, where Marilyn's long-distance boyfriend (Tom Noonan) keeps strict tabs on her.  Musical numbers include ""Bye, Bye Baby"" and the knockout ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.""

HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE (1953) - Fox's first widescreen comedy (CinemaScope) has Marilyn, Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable as New York City models who rent a swank Sutton Place address in search of husband material, start pawning the furniture to pay the rent, and let all hell break loose.

THE SEVEN-YEAR ITCH (1955) - Adapted from a very successful B'way comedy, starring Marilyn as ""The Girl"" (her real name is never given), as the upstairs neighbor to a would-be seducer (Tom Ewell), who gets notions one hot summer night.  Great supporting cast.

SOME LIKE IT HOT (1959) - The only film of the four not produced by Fox stars Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who go on the lam from the 1929 Chicago mob,  head to Florida disguised as part of an all-girl band, flirt with and are eventually conquered by Marilyn and Joe E. Brown.  One of Hollywood's funniest comedies ever, close to non-stop laughs.

6259308,4,B00ID75XAE,"Big fan of Marilyn Monroe's and these four comedies showcase her great timing and charisma. It's sad that this talented actress, because of appearances that worked against the possibility of male-dominated Hollywood taking her seriously, that she wasn't recognized for her comedic brilliance in her lifetime.

For instance, when I read articles about these movies that were written when she was alive, almost without fail the writers give the credit to the director. They'll say, ""the director managed to wring a great performance out of an actress who can't act."" If every single director she worked with managed this feat--then doesn't that mean she can act, and brilliantly?

During her lifetime it was a knee-jerk, herd-like response to deny her credit for anything she did. But now, years later, we can watch these films and recognize her talent for what it was.

On a side note, the one film I don't think *should* hold up as well as the others is Some Like it Hot, which--ironically, I think--is considered a classic of the cinema to this day. The reason why I say *should* is because the humor for this is based on the, at the time, taboo of same sex romance. It was funny because of its irreverence toward the taboo. Curiously, because people still say this is comic genius, it suggests that the taboo is still present deep down, despite lipservice toward supporting the gay community. I find this movie very strange because of it.",1490140800,2,1440,4.845528455284553

6259335,4,B00ID75XAE,"I have been a fan of Marilyn Monroe for more than a decade, and I have seen the majority of her motion picture work. I haven't purchased this set specifically, but I do own all four of these films, so I thought this would be a good way for me to review all for of them in one sitting.

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953/Color/91 minutes): This delightful musical comedy is an adaption of the successful Broadway play written by Anita Loos. Marilyn and Jane Russell (who gets top billing) are two showgirls that get wrapped up in some serious trouble while taking a luxury liner to France. Includes Monroe's famous rendition of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"".

How to Marry a Millionaire (1953/Color/95 minutes): This romantic comedy is undeniably old-fashioned, but still overly enjoyable. Marilyn is one of three models who rent a penthouse in New York in hopes of finding millionaires to marry. Betty Grable (who gets top billing in the opening credits) and Lauren Bacall are the other two ladies. While this movie isn't the best, it shows Marilyn in her prime and definitely worth a look-see.

The Seven Year Itch (1955/Color/105 minutes): This big screen version of a rather controversial 1952 play is quite amusing. A middle aged man (Tom Ewell) falls in love with his new upstairs neighbor (Monroe) while his wife and son are away for the summer. Most of the sexual innuendo and the scenes which explicitly reveal that the man and girl have an affair were completely removed to meat Production Code requirements. While some may see that as a let down, this is, nonetheless, a great classic without a doubt.

Some Like It Hot (1959/B&W/121 minutes): This is perhaps Monroe's most famous movie (but sadly one of her last). She's a ukulele player and singer in an all girl jazz band in 1929. She is befriended by two new additions to the band, although she's oblivious to the fact that they're actually men! Hilarious. Timeless. Comedy at its best.

These four movies showcase Marilyn Monroe's obvious sex appeal, her powerful screen presence, her singing abilities, and her spot-on comedy timing. Some Like It Hot is arguably the best of these four, followed closely with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, then The Seven Year Itch, and lastly How to Marry a Millionaire. I think How to Marry a Millionaire is the weakest because, in all honesty, it hasn't aged all that well. While Some Like It Hot may be the most popular of this batch, I believe that Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is the true ""Marilyn Movie"" here. She's in it from start to finish, and she's the ""blonde"" for crying out loud. This is a good introduction for those films buffs looking to see what Marilyn the Actress was, but overall, I do believe the movie choices could have been better.
