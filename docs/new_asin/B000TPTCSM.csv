2907650,5,B000TPTCSM,"This was by far one--if not the best workout DVDs I have ever used. I've tried all different kinds, but this one truly gave me an amazing workout that was fun, easy to follow and slowed down when I had trouble with a step. (thanks to the slow motion feature this DVD has!) Alec  and Edyta are very personable and it made it seem like you were working out with friends rather than with an instructor. It goes by quickly as well.....you barely realize you are working out! I recommend this to anyone who wants a fun workout",1193443200,23,521,4.316326530612245
2907651,5,B000TPTCSM,"Being a fan of the show I ordered the product, not expecting the workout to be much of a challenge as far as cardio goes.  Wow, was I wrong!  My heart rate was up, and thanks to the setting and wonderful instruction from Edyta...you almost forget you are working out!  As a personal trainer, I know that cross training is key to keeping the results coming, and this is something that I will incorporate into my program on a weekly basis.  It challenges my body in a completely different way than anything I get at the gym, and I love it!  Highly recommended! This proves the theory that trainers have been saying for years....working out IS fun! :)",1191801600,38,648,4.4576271186440675
2907652,5,B000TPTCSM,"I own both this DVD and its companion teaching DVD.  Both are wonderful, with easy to follow instructions.  In the fitness DVD, Edyta is your instructor, and she's everything you could ask for in a teacher.  There is even a helpful feature where if you have trouble figuring out a movement, you can have it broken down so you can learn at your own pace with just the touch of a button on your remote.  I've lost 30 pounds over 4 months with the help of this DVD, and I'm still just on the beginner workout, preparing to advance to the intermediate.  I found this DVD easier to follow and complete than the Dancing with the Stars one that features Ashly, Kym, and Maks.",1191369600,36,668,4.354838709677419
2907653,2,B000TPTCSM,"Poor instruction.  Slow-motion help does not break or slow down the steps adequately.  During routines, instructions are given with directions for the dancers behind he instructors -- not the DVD viewer.",1305936000,,203,5.516129032258065
2907654,3,B000TPTCSM,"This DVD is a little too slow for my taste. Even the advance section is not that difficult and you can't get a great workout out of it. I would recommend the DWTS DVD's instead. Sorry, even though I love Edyta.",1280707200,,210,4.146341463414634
2907655,5,B000TPTCSM,"There is something for all levels of dancing experience.  Although I have been dancing for a while, I always have to start from the beginner level (low impact) to get used to the moves.  But it's great!  I really feel it in my legs when I'm done.",1273363200,,246,4.191489361702128
2907656,5,B000TPTCSM,"Love it! Have ballroom background, so I skipped the basic section, and moved on to the 2nd and 3rd levels. They got my heart raising and I definitely felt like working out and dancing at the same time. Footwork was clear and easy to follow. The only thing I wish they hadn't done as much is focus so often on Edyta's face when she was giving instructions--we know she is lovely--it be best to focus on the her legs and feet. But again, definitely not a deal breaker.  This will be a DVD I will do over and over.",1271462400,,511,4.161616161616162
2907657,1,B000TPTCSM,"I was totally disapointed when I received this DVD.  I expected a good work out, good instruction, and specially to have fun.  I mean, if I didn't care about that I would buy a boot camp workout dvd, and not one with the DWTS logo on its cover.

Did I receive a good workout? NOOOO! I have to say I am a dancer that has been off the dancing floor for more than 4 years now, but back in my days I even worked as a Latin dances teacher.  I know my way around the latin dances moves, but after 4 years of a full time desk job I am utterly unfit.  So far with this DVD I've gone through the Beginners, and Intermediate workouts, and neither have made me break a sweat, and after it I had to go to my older videos and do another full session to actually feel like I had worked out.  And bear in mind I am not what you would call a fit person... I have to wonder, how would someone with adequate fitness feel after doing this?  I am sure it would be just like tickles to them.

Now, the instruction... it couldn't fail more grandly! Honestly I don't know why the guy even appears in the cover, as he doesn't say a single word for the 2 workouts I have gone through.  It seems to me he only stands there to show that unlike the people behind him, he can actually sweep his hips real nice.  Only Edyta does the actual instruction, and she is booooooring. I think I saw her smile only like 3 times through the workout, she gives no motivation at all, and her tone when she speaks reminds me of how I did my night prayers when I was little.  She doesn't give adequate description of the new steps, or even slows down to show the actual combination.  I have dancing training, and have difficult with some of the steps.  To make matters worse she addresses the audience behind her for her instruction, and not you.  She uses right and left the way her audience behind sees it, and now the way you, following her from the front, have it.  BIG INSTRUCTION MISSHAP!  To top it all, the guy coordinating the cameras must have been on vacation when the video was being filmed.  Most of the time they focus on her face, or even the ""student"" faces, and  totally forget about showing you the leg movement.  This would be ok from time to time, but not when a new movement is being described.  I mean, they don't take the time to break down the step, the least they could do is to focus on the legs so that at least you could see what the new movement is about!

Is it fun? Perhaps you can conclude from my opinion above I think it is not.  If they say they are going to use certain rhythms to dance your way to fitness, I'd expect some actual dancing, which for me is what would make it fun.  This felt to me as an Aerobics class, to a sort of chacha/zamba/etc music.  It teaches you virtually no real move you could actually use in the dance floor, and fails to give you a good workout, so to me it fails in both accounts.

I would honestly recommend the actual DWTS dvds, over this ""fitness"" dvd.  So far, I've tried the Cardio Workout, and the Dance off the Pounds (my favorite!) DVDs and I've enjoyed then thoroughly.  I've read the others are not that good, but I wouldn't know.  Also real better is the Dancing with Julianne.  That is a DVD that I would rate with 5 stars.",1269388800,,3258,4.151515151515151
2907658,4,B000TPTCSM,"I really like this workout. It's very different from your standard cardio and, although cuing may be a little lax at times, it's easy to follow (for the most part). Not only can you choose from different workout levels, you can choose which of the dances to do in each level. That makes it easier to get a short workout if needed. The only thing that I don't like, and it is a fairly large inconvenience, is that you can't pause, rewind, or otherwise navigate. While that may not seem like a huge deal, it is extremely irritating when your phone rings and you have to choose between starting the dance over later or taking the call.",1262736000,,632,4.410256410256411
2907659,5,B000TPTCSM,"""Fitness with the Pros"" is a three-level program that features Edyta Sliwinska, from Dancing with the Stars, as the instructor.  Her husband (Alec Mazo) is on the DVD with her, but he says nothing the entire time.  The workout is divided into three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.  There were four dance styles taught, but they were not necessarily on each level.  I will be breaking down this DVD by dance style.

Waltz:
Beginner - This was a very easy, very slow-paced set of movements.  There were only a few steps to learn in it, and Edyta explained them rather well.  This isn't very good cardio, but it works the legs a lot due to the many lunges and calf raises that you do in the moves.  Overall, the waltz is a very leisurely, beginner workout.

Cha-Cha:
Beginner - Although the moves in this section are very basic and easy to do, Edyta expects you to know them already and she will just call out the name of the step and expect you to follow.  It shouldn't be too hard to pick up as the moves are basic, but maybe you should just watch the first time.  Also note that there is a ""break it down"" option on each move that will allow you to watch the move in slow motion if you just can't get it.

Intermediate - This was a little bit faster-paced.  There were some moves from the beginner section, but there are several new moves introduce.  At the end of this section Edyta puts all the steps together for a short routine.

Samba:
Intermediate - The moves are basic Samba moves; however, once again, Edyta just calls out the moves and expects you to know them.  This is a bit fast-paced, and it may be a but harder to pick up than the Cha-Cha, but once you get it, it is a great cardio workout.  There is a lot of bouncing in the legs, so you may even get a bit of toning in this routine.

Advanced - The moves are much quicker in this level, and more arms are added.  The moves get a bit more complex, but this is a great section for people who really want to get a good workout while doing REAL dance moves.  Once again, if anything gets too tricky, the ""break it down"" option is still available.

Jive:
Beginner - The jive isn't too hard to pick up in the beginner level, for it consists mostly of basic jumps and kicks.  However, it is a huge cardio segment as you jump or kick almost constantly.  The moves are simple but high cardio.  At the end there is a short ""pelvis"" exercise, which is basically an ab exercise.

Intermediate - A few new moves are added into this level, so a new dancer might be thrown off as Edyta, yet again, just calls out the moves.  But the new moves are very simple, and most people will catch on.  However, this moves a bit faster than the beginner jive, and it is just as (if not more) challenging cardio-wise.

Advanced - This is the most intense workout of them all.  This routine is super fast will a lot of jumps, kicks, flicks, fast footwork, and more.  It will be challenging, but like I said with another workout, this one will have you working out with REAL dance moves.  Unlike the other workouts which all come in at about 10 minutes, this segment is a whopping 20 minutes.

Each style of dance has a music track that plays with it no matter what level you are on, so some might get sick of the music, but I rather like it.  And there are cool-downs after each section, which can be annoying if you are doing multiple in a row, but you can use the fast-forward button.  So, although it has a few flaws for non-dancers and easily frustrated people, this was the perfect workout for a dancer like me, and I find myself doing it at least once a week.  It's great because you can start at beginner and eventually built up to a huge workout.  As a final note, this DVD was a follow up to ""Dancing Like the Pros"" which was a teaching DVD.  This might be the reason Edyta expects you to know the moves, but I don't own this teaching DVD, so I'm not sure.  Once again, this was great DVD with multiple levels and styles that all should like!",1259712000,3,4003,4.266932270916334
2907660,4,B000TPTCSM,"I found this to be my favorite of the current three ""DWTS"" DVDs I have purchased thus far. It has three different levels, and a ""help"" in slow motion for more explanation. It's more difficult than the DVD hosted by Ashley, Max and Kym, but it's a lot of fun. It does perhaps lack the warmth of that one--which is charming, but simpler. This one has really helped me tone, esp. my lower body and core.",1255392000,,400,4.276315789473684
2907661,5,B000TPTCSM,Love it!,1252800000,,8,3.5
2907662,5,B000TPTCSM,"This video is really setup well. It has three impact levels and three dances within each level. I have two other dancing with the stars videos, but this one is my favorite. I really like the instructor and dances.",1251936000,,213,4.487179487179487
2907663,3,B000TPTCSM,This video does have some merit but I actually found it hard to follow as Edyta does not project her voice that well.  Plus I have a carpeted home and doing this on carpeting just doesn't work.  You do need an uncarpeted room to do this in. I was disappointed but at the same time I thought it appeared to be a good and challenging workout.,1248393600,,340,4.136363636363637
2907664,4,B000TPTCSM,"This is a great fun workout. I wish it were a little longer in duration, but you can mix and match which dances you want to custom make your workout which is nice. Would recommend to someone wanting out of a workout rut.",1246320000,,220,4.1395348837209305
2907665,4,B000TPTCSM,This video really gets my heart rate up!  It's fun to do even though its a little hard to follow (but they do have a slower help section if you need it).,1244505600,,153,3.78125
2907666,5,B000TPTCSM,I love dance aerobic dvds and this by far is better than Dancing with the Stars.  So give it a try!!,1243987200,,100,3.761904761904762
2907667,5,B000TPTCSM,"Even the low-impact version will have you slightly sore the next day... By your 2nd pass at it, you're dancing like a pro!  Great job!",1234483200,,134,4.36
2907668,3,B000TPTCSM,"To start, I have absolutely no dance experience at all.  This DVD does not teach you HOW to dance, but uses a sequence of dance movements to give the viewer a good workout.  There are 3 levels... beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  If you're like me, and don't know how to dance, it will probably take you some time to go through and figure out what exactly they are doing with their feet!  But once you figure it out, this DVD is SO much fun to do.  I use this to motivate me into exercising when I don't feel like doing anything else!

I would give this DVD 5 stars if they did a better job at explaining what they're about to do (especially for the ""beginner"" section.)",1232409600,,675,4.275590551181103
2907669,5,B000TPTCSM,"This a great DVD to work out with, simple and nice with great dance moves. Buy it and you won't regret it. Edyta is really good and she encourages you to do better.",1227657600,,164,4.0
2907670,5,B000TPTCSM,"This is an excellent DVD  workout for all ages. Im in my forties and Ive been working out with almost everyday for the last 4 months. It has 3 segments(low,medium and high impact),I haven't reach the high impact segment as yet and the total duration is about 90 mints. Its easy to learn, its rhythmic. Ive never danced before but after this workout, the chacha,waltz,jive and samba seems not too difficult at all. I highly recommend this DVD. Its not only good for your health,but its fun and at the same time you get to learn something new.
 S.Pamei",1225670400,,550,4.545454545454546
2907671,3,B000TPTCSM,Edyta needs to do more explanations of the steps; it's as if she assumes her viewers know them. I would have liked Alex to have taught as well. Good workout however,1225324800,,164,4.32258064516129
2907672,5,B000TPTCSM,"I recently received this and I can't stop using it! Edyta and Alec make the work-out extremely fun since the routines are more dance-based. The workouts have three-level of impact from low to high so it's ok for beginners to start and ease their way into it. The workout also really helps dancers or those studying dance to improve their technique. For non-dancers, the work-out may be a little difficult at first since they can go fast but the DVD has a help option during the workout that slows down the movement and breaks it down for you. Getting fit is like dancing, you must stay committed to it to see results, so if you stay committed to this DVD you'll get into the moves easier and improve your coordination. Edyta will have you sweating within minutes.",1213920000,5,763,4.576642335766423
2907673,3,B000TPTCSM,"The workout itself is OK.  You will work up a sweat and feel it in your legs and abs but it is not a lot of fun.  Also, there is not a lot of cueing, the music is boring and repetitive and the camera angles are terrible.",1212537600,2,220,3.6595744680851063
2907674,4,B000TPTCSM,Fitness with the Pros is a really a good workout. I have numerous workout tapes & DVD's and gave up on them after several tries as I found them boring.  This is the best one that I have tried so far.,1210291200,,199,3.8536585365853657
2907675,4,B000TPTCSM,"It is a solid workout, relatively easy to master ( dance sequences are not overly complicated, even on the high impact level ) and it will definitely make you sweat. Another plus is that, for a dance workout, it does not require too much space.
Now some minuses:
- Edyta is the only one that seems to have some fun doing it. Don't get me wrong, I hate artificially enthusiastic, constantly smiling exercises in the background but this bunch looks really dreadfully serious, if not bored ( especially the blonde girl standing right behind Edyta )
- camera angles could be better - sometimes you can see Edyta's face or upper body only when she's introducing new steps",1206576000,3,666,4.6525423728813555
2907676,4,B000TPTCSM,"This workout it well structured.
There are three section:beginner, intermediate and advanced.
Each section is 30 mins long.

I think that it is true what some others have voiced. Yes there seems to be more focus on executing the moves than on having 'fun' while exercising. The majority of communication consists of announcing the moves and getting on with the program. You won't find a friendly back and forth banter betweeb presenters here....Alex Mazo hardly or does not say anything at all. I have to criticize the expanation of moves. Firstly moves are introduced by their dance terms and immediately the move is performed a tempo. This is extremely difficult to follow through with the first few times you watch, you would HAVE to hit the slo motion and pick it up from there (that in itself consists of a brief exhibition with an explanation that is sometimes difficult to follow). I think that perhaps more time to pproperly lead followers step by step into the moves would have helped. I do latin and ballroom dancing for a a little while now, I love it and usually pick up the steps with relative ease, but I admit that initially I had prolems with a few of these steps...with a little bit of practice though I was fine.

It is a fair work out, I work up a sweat. Once you  have practised through the routine steps it becomes easier. But the choreography is more diverse than that which we saw with the Cardio dance,there are more moves and I like the variety...it also includes a waltz session which I find a brilliant idea, it give some good lunges work outs...(I think it is creative just like the Paso Doble section in the cardio dancea good way to incorporate ballroom and latin dancing into cardio).

If you prefer a more friendly banter with your workout with a fair work out then choose the cardio dance...I have used them both.
If you want more variety and a bit more of a challenge then choose this.

Bottomline, it is a great work out, challenging in terms of steps and creative choreography but if you are a beginner start with  cardio dance then go to this, you will see what i mean when yo get to the intermediate and high intensity. Also if you are an exerciser who needs motivation, then this may not be for you, there are no ""you can do it"" ' s or ""come you're doing well"" 's .

I felt that somewarm up stretches should have been done but the stretching done in between dance style changes were good and I could really feel them hitting the muscle groups worked.

Finally I think that the music could have been a little more 'fun' there are so many very nice swing/jive hits that they could have used the music from and perhaps changing the music up and not using the SAME tune for samba and the SAME for each jive would have been fun.
And also a littl more ethnic variety in the back up team of dancers, just a thought....Maks and Kym did that!

So not a 5 star but if you are looking for a good workout, it delivers.",1204329600,5,2945,4.4288354898336415
2907677,3,B000TPTCSM,"Menu Options:
Beginner - Waltz, Cha Cha, Jive
Intermediate - Cha Cha, Samba, Jive
Advanced - Samba, Jive
All are 10 min each, all have a Help option during the workouts to see a SHORT 30 second slow-mo camera speed with Edyta in voice over telling you how to move your feet. Moves that most never heard of like volta point, step point twists, etc. are all taught this way. All dancers ALWAYS face you, never show their back or side views.
Stage - large hardwood floor going back a good 40 ft. to tall white, simple backboards with the black ceiling exposed with extra colored lighting. There are 8 men & women behind Edyta & Alec. Everyone looks serious about perfecting their dancing & the idea of fun is the furtherst thing from their minds. Edyta calls out the type of step & counts. Barely any other instruction is given. The camera stays on Edyta's face & other beautiful dancer's faces & rarely shows their feet.
The direction/teaching style looks more concerned with looking cool/stylish rather then helpful. It does have beautiful production, but I'm not happy it's at the sake of helping one to follow the steps.
The dancing has many steps I'd never seen & everyone dances well.
The moves are good overall, it will definitely make anyone break a sweat with it's fast pace & vigorous movements, I just like a more relaxed, fun, body awareness type of dancing or at least fun/centered on burning calories. Not this style on perfection/stiffness.
I actually found this harder to follow then ther Dancing with the Stars: Cardio workout dvd, since at least that one contained dance steps/moves that are popular & found on other dance workout dvds.
If they added a 1/2 speed teaching of all the steps instead of a quick slow-mo, more camera work showing the feet even of background dancers, showed some laughing or smiling & had fun, this would be 5 stars.
This is good for those who can learn with minimal instruction, who are already dancers or have had dance class training or at least an extensive dvd collection.

I have now tried Dancing with the Pros. That is the more instructional set, while this is the cardio/practice set. Why split it up to be more confusing & giving it different names? Makes no sense, like the content. The Dancing with the Pros splits the dances to beginner, intermediate, advanced for each that run consecutively & each difficulty is about 10 min each. This time they teach in 1/4 (very slow), exaggerate the steps a couple of times, then FULL tempo which is quite jarring. I do best with 1/2 time for a long time WHILE giving instruction & later full tempo as many dances are truly fast & very few dancers can keep proper form going so fast so soon. Again, with all the couples behind them, same stage, they never turn their back to you, the camera likes to look cool by showing the upper body so you can't even focus on the feet.",1203984000,15,2867,4.58869395711501

This DVD offers some fast paced routines with interesting steps, and the music is somewhat infectious.  I was sweating a lot with the advanced level routines.  The other routines are fine for learning steps or when you want something less strenuous.

Trying to learn the advanced routines would have been very difficult, even with the slow motion help, had I not slowed the entire routine down to 70-90 percent speed (I used my laptop and VLC media player).  The steps are repeated enough that the camera taking on different angles shouldn't be a big problem for anyone once you do the video a couple of times.

On the contrary--I ordered it with ""Dance Off The Pounds"" from Dancing With The Stars and THAT one turned out to be garbage. Easy to follow and can also help to learn dance moves!! Thanks for an easy to follow video...would recommend to everyone!!!",1362873600,,355,4.476923076923077
8210302,5,B000TPTCSM,This is a great workout at all three levels! Loved every minute of it! And you WILL burn calories even with the low impact. Took me a couple of times to get the moves down but moves are fairly straight forward. Edita is awesome!!,1362009600,,229,4.2272727272727275
8210303,5,B000TPTCSM,"Fun, challenging and a total cardio blast! Before you know it, you will have gone through the 3 levels while getting a workout you did not think possible from a ""dance"" DVD.

This is not an instructional DVD; it does have a ""Help"" feature that you can invoke from within the workout itself. It may take you a few views to get all the steps, but you will have a blast doing so and when you are done you will want to do it all over again.

There are a couple of really funny things, like when the camera focuses on Edyta's face as she is trying to demonstrate a step. Really? I know she is gorgeous; can I please see her feet?? hahahaha. I also would have loved if it was shown mirror style, so I can match my movements to what I see on the screen. Still, I would not trade this one for anything. I find myself coming back to it over and over again.",1352073600,,847,4.035714285714286
