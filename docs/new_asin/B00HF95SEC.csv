6160939,3,B00HF95SEC,"Three stars is a bit generous but I feel this is okay for a standard low-budget zombie action film. They just keep making them, though the limitations of the genre prevent anyone from really doing much that's different than anyone else. In the zombie universe, these are infected, the relatively fast types caused by a virus. However unlike most infected types who are just raging humans (and thus respond like humans and die when given any lethal wound), these can only be killed by being shot in the head and dead people are seen becoming one of them. So it's a mix of infected and zombie attributes.

One thing makes this different. It's shot in Israel with an Israeli cast and production team. However this does not make it that different. The politics of the Middle East are there but do not take a front seat and besides fueling a few arguments and reactions are not much of a dactor here. Considering the small budget, you get the accordingly small cast in deserted or rural locations and limited CGI effects. If any of those things turn you off, then look elsewhere. Basically a small team of elite soldiers is sent on a secret mission to Lebanon to kidnap the #3 man of Hezbollah. Everything goes awry when it turns out that a zombie-creating virus has been released in the area. Now Hezbollah is the least of their worries. What follows is scenes of talking broken up by zombie attacks. The attacks grow larger and more frequent as the film progresses.

Overall, Battle of the Undead has the feel of a competent homemade film or an inexpensive cable movie. The basics are there. The focus is on action, though none of the action sequences is particularly well done or memorable. In fact nothing about the film is really memorable. It's one of those films that is okay while you're watching it and then will never be thought of again.",1472774400,,1843,4.615853658536586

6161045,3,B00HF95SEC,"A  ""B"" Zombie Flick with an interesting twist. Worth watching and provides a zombie fix for those fans looking to digest something of the genre... Its an OK movie - but not a great one. Premise is that the Isreali Defense Force starts the zombie apocalypse and a special forces team is sent in to retrieve patient 0. Of course along the way - it uses EVERY SINGLE trope that there is. Starting with the evil one eyed general, and his mysterious civilian called back to duty to do ""one last mission"". It goes downhill from there. Obviously the zombie genre requires you to suspend disbelief, but sometimes you can just go too far. Does the IDF, with world famous special forces, not have any active duty people to handle a mission? Does their health care plan not provide a general with a glass eye instead of a pirate patch? Can their military officers not read?  ""That thing you signed did you think it was an NDA, you reupped for five more years!"" GIMME A BREAK. Also - if you were sending a special forces team into the middle of a zombie apocalypse - wouldn't it be a good idea to you know - BRIEF THEM ABOUT THE ZOMBIES? Maybe let them know that this patient 0 your are trying to extract is a dead guy who is running around eating people and that you might find Lebanon crawling with zombies when you arrive??? That falls under the category of ""useful facts"" that  might prevent the team from getting an unpleasant surprise when taking a leak. (Yes, seriously it actually happened - yet another trope. Soon as he unzipped I knew what was coming.) Its not as bad as a SyFy Saturday night movie - but this is one of those things you should watch for your own version of Mystery Science Theatre - watch it, get drunk, and wisecrack through it.",1439078400,,1745,4.413043478260869

6161078,3,B00HF95SEC,The first zombie movie out of Israel that I have seen is this one.  The story is basic.  Israel Special Force's of some sort are sent into a hostile Palestinian area to get a scientist.  There are a few hints that perhaps something unusual is happening and a vaccine may be needed.  The small group of soldiers are quite surprised to find the latest in zombies chowing down on some folks.  Will the small band get the scientist out with his daughter?  Watch it and see.  It isn't an awful zombie movie.  One can tell the actors are talking a different language with English coming out.  The CG isn't horrible.  The blood is a bit too red.  Something about women wearing Hijab's and eating people seems to me-just too amusing to pass up.  I feel it is worth watching just for that visual.  I wouldn't own this movie.  Rent is enough.

Not so great:
special effects - primarily explosions looked like something from the 70's or 80's.

Lack of excitement, gore, and a real apocalyptic ""feel"", this one leaves zombie fans feeling a bit cheated.  My advice:  Don't pay for this one guys.",1407196800,5,518,4.410526315789474

6161149,2,B00HF95SEC,"Not to bad some of the acting was over the top.
Which I mean they tried to hard and over did it.
Some of the dubbing was off in certain scenes.

All in all not too bad, but I could only give it 2 stars.",1402963200,,202,3.488888888888889
6161150,2,B00HF95SEC,"I gave this two stars for no other reason than the out take during the credits was mildly amusing. Everything else about this movie was 1 star worthy. This movie was bad and I don't mean funny bad. Everything about this movie was preposterous. The acting ranged from so-so to ho-hum. One does not really expect high class dialogue from a zombie movie but this one hit new lows. I could not turn off the subtitles which did not always match the dialogue. Sometimes this was amusing. This movie does have a plot but is absurd. Would the Israelis really be stupid enough to fund a turncoat Hezbollah agent at a lab beyond their control inside Hezbollah controlled territory to produce a biological weapon? If a scientist did develop a biological weapon, would he really test it on himself--thus becoming the first zombie? I have probably seen worse zombie flicks but this one is at the forefront right now.",1400889600,3,903,4.685534591194968
6161151,1,B00HF95SEC,Poor is an understatement of this flick. It has very little originality and it was overrated in the ratings listing. I wish I could get my money back. Don't waste your money. So now I am poorer for ordering this.,1400198400,,212,4.325
6161152,3,B00HF95SEC,"As I've said in other reviews I'm a big fan of B horror movies and this one kind of caught my eye. Once I started watching it I realized that this was the first Israeli horror movie that I had come across. As a zombie horror movie it was somewhat typical of the genre with some pretty good action sequences! On another level this movie was totally fascinating for the portrayal of Israeli racial mores and attitudes and they didn't pull any punches. The interaction among the Israeli spec ops squad and how they talked about each other was more than a little interesting. Oddly it reminded me of my days in Bosnia when I went out with an Englishman, Welshman and an Irishman! The way they talked about and to each other was exactly the same. Anyone who thinks America has the market cornered on racism is mistaken. Again, as a zombie horror movie it's decent enough with good action what makes it really good is the interaction of the squad who is on the mission. You want to learn about another culture, check this one out!",1399939200,12,1024,4.452127659574468

Absolute and utter trash without even a scintilla of merit on any level. This garbage should be given negative stars. And lots of them.",1526256000,,303,5.204081632653061
8632237,4,B00HF95SEC,"I am very interested in Israel and I try to support israeli films. I also love zombie movies. This is an Israeli zombie movie and is pretty good.
There are some shocking elements of racism against black Jews in this movie. Much of the dialogue is focused on racist insults against a black Jewish soldier. It is very strange, specific racism. I guess it was scripted to raise sensitivity and awareness about racism against black Jews. I hope that is the reason. Otherwise, it is just terrible racist insulting dialogue that is unecessary to the film.
The story is pretty good. The acting is pretty good overall. The action is choreographed well. the special efects are decent.
I would have really enjoyed the fim more if it did not include that racist dialogue. The film itself is not racist...the sympathy is for the black Jewish soldier, Moti and not for the racist, Daniel. It is just strange to have extreme racism in a zombie movie.
The movie is good. Racism is bad.",1522195200,,970,4.645348837209302
