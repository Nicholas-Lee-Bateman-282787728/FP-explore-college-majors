2458440,3,B000CDFZPK,"I have loved this movie for many years.  I was really excited to get it in DVD.  However, the quality of the movie is not good.  It was obviously just copied off the VHS.  Too bad, because it is a great family movie.",1362182400,2,216,3.953488372093023

2458443,4,B000CDFZPK,It is simply a heartwarming story.  No fancy production or intense moments - just a good story of the Christmas spirit.  Watch it with the family and then talk about it.,1356307200,,169,4.419354838709677
2458444,5,B000CDFZPK,"I fully agree with the reviewer that said this movie is not the best production value, BUT it is definitely worth watching. I second that opinion and second that review -- make it two. Ditto on the above. Watch this if you want a new take on the Christmas Story -- a take that shows the inclination of all humans to be Scrooges, and yet the beauty and benefit that comes when we transcend that natural state in the Grace of Christmas. Powerful story. And type-casting is perfect. Force yourself to get past the poor production quality and enjoy a narrative well-told. Merry Christmas whenever you watch it -- even in June!",1340582400,6,622,4.5625
2458445,5,B000CDFZPK,This a truly a beautiful and heartwarming movie for the whole family.  The simple story reminds us of the true meaning of life to love our neighbors as ourselves.  The snowy Utah scenery in the movie is breathtaking.  I certainly recommend the movie for people of all ages.,1331683200,4,273,4.645833333333333
2458449,5,B000CDFZPK,"We first saw this movie on SHOWTIME in 1983 and fell in love with it. We have been searching for it everywhere for over 25 years!!! It is one of the best family Christmas movies ever made. Slim Pickens is a riot to see in this movie. If your looking for a movie the whole family will enjoy, this is it.",1260230400,3,302,3.9672131147540983
2458450,4,B000CDFZPK,"Not exactly the best production quality, screenplay, score or acting, but a powerful and poignant Christmas message that underscores the true meaning of Christmas with a western twist. Recommended for the casual viewing and a good change of pace from the Christmas classics.  Unlikely that you will make it part of your annual holiday ritual, but you are missing something if you don't see it.

This is well suited for kids, probably under 15, and will likely get many watchers choked up.",1260057600,8,488,4.939024390243903

2458454,5,B000CDFZPK,"Christmas Mountain (a.k.a The Cowboy Angel), starring the late and wonderful Slim Pickens and Mark Miller(Savannah Smiles,various TV series) was made in 1981. It is an absolutely charming holiday film about the true meaning of the spirit of Christmas. Slim Pickens  stars as The Cowboy Angel who comes to the cowboy character played by Mark Miller (Pickens' old cowpoke friend), in the middle of the night not unlike Marley in A Christmas Carol. The drifting cowpoke wanders into a mountain town on the border where Mexicans tend sheep. He gets caught in a blizzard. It is nearly Christmas.  He eats a sumptuous meal and then can't pay for it.  He is thrown in jail but is later bailed out to do the bigoted town peoples' dirty work for them. They press him into service to deliver some pathetic hand-me-down gifts of clothing and stale food to a ""poor"" family in order to assuage their own guilty conscience over being fat, dumb, comfortable and warm in their little village while those ""Mexican Sheepherders"" are up on Christmas Mountain alone. The Spanish family is a recently widowed young mother, pregnant and due any minute, her young son and old mother. The towns' people celebrate Christmas service patting themselves on the back for the good deeds they have down during the past year which of course are delusions of the real truth of their selfishish and money grubbing. The Cowboy goes to the mountain delivering the gifts and stays over night in the shed because ""Cow Folks and Sheep Folks"" don't mix. Of course his Cowboy Angel appears to him in the night telling how he must mend his past sinful ways if he is to get his own wings someday and get into heaven. Slim himself is almost there, and all he needs to graduate is to save his old buddy by putting him on the right path, and then Slim will finally get his wings.

It is a complelely charming and delightful story though on a parallel course of so many other classic holiday films, with one soul helping another to see the right and virtuous light. THIS IS MOST DEFINITELY A FAMILY FILM FOR ALL AGES and will warm anyone's heart who enjoys nice happy endings. Despite its obvious low budget, it blends wonderful acting with beautiful western vistas, and a real feeling that we are all the same afterall, under the skin and in our beliefs, feelings, hopes and dreams. I have watched this film every year at Christmas beginning from when my daughters were young over 25 years ago right up to the past Christmas when my old VHS tape wouldn't play any longer and I gratefully found the DVD on Amazon.",1169078400,35,2566,4.645374449339207

2458456,3,B000CDFZPK,"Christmas Mountain is a wonderful family movie...a movie for all ages. It has a wonderful message of love and caring, a little action and the acting is well done. Slim Pickens is fun to watch as a Christmas angel. This is not an academy award winning film by any means but it is enjoyable for holidays.",1168300800,16,302,4.410714285714286
