Full of effect and nice script.
The only bad thing is that there is no Russian language in the first DVD.
So, it's a very good choice for those who like action/fiction/with-cool-effects movies.",1205020800,7,211,4.888888888888889

Was disappointed not to be able to listen to the Russian

Otherwise, I enjoyed both DVDs.",1202688000,19,213,5.085714285714285
2931410,1,B000V6LSL8,"if you buy this movie based from the great preview like I did you are making a mistake. the previews are the only scenes like that, no more action just boring stuff. I sold it on Amazon the next day!",1202515200,3,199,4.0
2931411,3,B000V6LSL8,"As long as you go into watching these movies understanding they bear little resemblance to the fantastic series of books, you'll enjoy them.  Daywatch is the better of the two films.

If they ever make a ""Hollywood"" version and actually follow the books more accurately.  Here's who I picture in some of the parts:

Anton Gorodetsky-- Robert Carlyle  (he's the only one that can play the part!)

Gesar--Ed Harris

Zabulon--Terry O'Quinn

Olga--Cate Blanchett",1202428800,4,458,5.178082191780822

2931413,4,B000V6LSL8,THE FIRST ITEM WAS LOST BUT YOU WERE VERY QUICK WHEN I CONTACTED YOU ABOUT NOT RECEIVING IT. THANK YOU,1200009600,,102,4.15
2931414,5,B000V6LSL8,"This DVD set includes both the brilliant urban fantasy NIGHT WATCH as well as the more toned down DAY WATCH.

NIGHT WATCH follows Anton Gorodetsky (Konstantin Khabensky) as he discovers he isn't a normal human and is an Other with magical powers.  Anton chooses to join the forces of Light and spends his time hunting vampires, trying to remove a witch's curse, and stop the end of the world from happening.

DAY WATCH continues the story begun in NIGHT WATCH.  It takes place two years later and deals more with the internal struggles of Anton as he struggles with the demons of his past while continuing to do the right thing.  In the meantime, someone has framed Anton for the murders of Dark Ones.  Anton finds himself on the run while trying to locate the mysterious Chalk of Fate that could enable him to reverse the wrong decisions of his life.

NIGHT WATCH and DAY WATCH form the first two films of a planned trilogy and owning them together in one set for the price of one film is a great bargain.  Of course, you might just want to wait a few years until after the third film of the series, TWILIGHT WATCH is out and then just get all three.",1198627200,26,1151,4.421800947867299
2931415,5,B000V6LSL8,"I saw both movies in the series - and I can only say whoa; Ive send plenty of us action movies - but this movie made them all look like by third graders. The special effects are just mind-boggling. The story really takes wild twists and turns - you have no clue what to except next (compare that to cookie-cutter hollywood plots). I guess some people might say that story is hard to follow because - i liked - but even if - the end of the movie makes it all worth it. Character acting makes the scenes feel creepingly real - as they are very melodramatic moments from real life. Even if you are not usually into vampires & witches - still watch this movie - as the movie will quickly succumb with you in variety of different cinematographic elements (too bad its not availalble on blu-ray).

BEST damn action movies PERIOD",1197676800,18,822,4.372549019607843
2931416,4,B000V6LSL8,Both of these movies are like nothing you can expect. The director has taken the viewer on a cinematic adventure through his mind. Watch both movies in order and I promise you will not be disappointed.,1196985600,11,201,4.611111111111111
2931427,4,B000V6LSL8,these two movies are great! if you love vampire movies from russia,1409097600,,66,4.583333333333333
2931428,5,B000V6LSL8,I saw a preview for these movies and looked them up. Decided for their price to give them a shot. Glas I did.,1403568000,,109,3.782608695652174
2931429,5,B000V6LSL8,"To describe these as well-made films would be an understatement.  The actors and actresses are superlative, the special-effects are thrilling, the themes and plotting are riveting and also quite poignant. Everything about this film is beautiful, even the very violent scenes. That's one thing to watch out for, it does have a good deal of violence. But it's not gore like B-grade or C-grade horror/slasher films.  Although special effects are used, the violence has ""the feel of real"" to it.  The films can be watched in English, but I prefer to watch them in Russian with English subtitles. One especially well done part is..... Nah, I don't want to spoil it for you. Let's just say these films more than deserve their blockbuster status.",1402876800,4,739,4.943548387096774
2931430,5,B000V6LSL8,I love Russian films.  They don't follow the standard American or western European lines of having the same hero type and the same villian type.  These two packaged together makes for a great buy and definitely worth the time for true sci-fi fans.,1402012800,,247,4.72093023255814
2931431,5,B000V6LSL8,"The Night Watch/Day Watch movies together make a great moral play done in high camp.  The beginning and the end of the movies is the moral  ethic and the rest is a fun romp.

The movies do not follow the Watch series, but use some of the characters and settings of the Watch series.

Enjoyed it very much.",1398729600,,305,4.206896551724138
2931432,3,B000V6LSL8,"New and different ways of showing from the Hollywood format, which is great.  Tendency to drag and not carry the viewer through too well.  But still worth having!  Because it is different!",1372550400,,188,4.8125
2931433,3,B000V6LSL8,"I'm a huge fan of the book series and wanted to see it on screen for a visual experience.

Keep in mind: This was made and produced in Russia, with subs or dub in english.

That said, it isn't exactly to the US standard of effects, but does the trick for visual. I recommend watching it with subs. Dub is attrocious!",1368662400,,316,4.163934426229508
2931434,4,B000V6LSL8,It was definitely a whole new take on this kind of movie..some parts I liked..but some areas were quite slow!,1362614400,,109,4.5
2931435,3,B000V6LSL8,"Well, because I like special effects, maybe Russian humor doesn't translate well.  Still I liked both movies.  Two movies that do need to be together.",1358726400,,150,4.96
2931436,5,B000V6LSL8,I love the film. I am a big science fiction fan and enjoyed the theme. I would recommend it to anyone who loves the supernatural.,1354665600,,129,4.2
2931447,3,B000V6LSL8,Saw the previews and wanted to see the movie for the special effects. Strange and hard to follow the aspects of the story line in the first movie. Just what you expect of a movie produced by a Russian. The second movie followed many of the same cast of characters and would not make any sense without watching the first movie. I enjoyed watching the movies and understand why others would rate it a confusing and minor film. One of those films that would probably have to be watched several times to catch all the subplots that are happeining against the main character.,1351468800,,570,4.543689320388349
2931448,1,B000V6LSL8,"I have read the entire Daywatch series twice. I was incredibly excited to find out that they had been translated into film. That didn't last long. They completely destroyed the series. Even if you haven't read the books, such as my girlfriend, these movies are a complete disappointment. You have no idea what's going on half the time. This is the worst film adaptation I have ever seen. I would pay somebody not to watch these movies. The books are amazing though so I highly recommend reading them.",1330905600,,500,4.693181818181818
2931449,5,B000V6LSL8,"Just watched these Russian made Action Sci-fi movies and I have to say they are rather good. The visual effects are very, very cool. I did prefer Night Watch to Day Watch, but only because it seemed to have more happening than Day Watch. An action movie has to have action and at times I felt like Day Watch was more a Drama then an action movie. Even so they are very entertaining and I would watch both of them again. Don't let the made in Russia part scare you off if Russian isn't your native language. Both movies are dubbed in English, French, and Spanish Languages as well as subtitles in each language. But it's not the cheesy kind of dubbing where the guy is finished talking but his lips are still moving. Of course with any dubbing that will happen but your barely notice it when it does happen in these movies and it rarely happens. Strangely enough for a movie made in Russia the first movie in the series, Night Watch, doesn't have Russian Language or subtitles as options in this DVD.",1326931200,2,999,4.405405405405405
2931450,3,B000V6LSL8,"These first two parts of the trilogy are, honestly, a mess. Visually there is too much happening and the steps the story takes almost make zero sense. When you strip it down to its basics--good vs. evil--it does work. When the director gets into flashbacks or parallel worlds it just gets wonky.

Having said that, the shots of Russian city streets at night are mindblowingly great. The B-movie vampire/werewolf/shapeshifter babe factor should be upgraded when the director does the third part of this trilogy.

I will give Count Floyd (the lead actor is a dead ringer for SCTV's Joe Flaherty) props.

The English dub of Night Watch is decent in addition to being able to watch it in the original Russian. I still found Day Watch a far more linear story and had a much more understandable setup.

If you're a fan of the Matrix, you'll dig this series. Vampire movie fans, I think you'll be left wanting more.",1321920000,,908,4.6918238993710695
2931451,1,B000V6LSL8,"I saw the first movie before I new they were based on books. When I discovered the books, I got sucked in and read all four right through, then went to watch the movies (first ""Night Watch"" again, then ""Day Watch"". The first is sort of bearable, if terribly wrong in many ways. The second is utter rubbish. Wish I'd never seen it.",1302220800,,330,4.253968253968254
2931452,5,B000V6LSL8,"it took me awhile to figure out how to play the movie in russian but overrall satisfied with my purchase. the dvd's were exactly the condition as listed.

2931453,5,B000V6LSL8,I really love the creepy feel of this movie. It is extremely well done for a foriegn film. I prefer watching it with subtitles to the dubbed version. It seems to lose a little of the creepy in english. The sequel doesn't give you the choice it is dubbed. I like that they came as a double feature. It had some pretty cool special effects.,1299888000,,338,4.2153846153846155

2931455,5,B000V6LSL8,Loved the books and loved the movies too. did a fantastic job making the films from a very complicated but fantastic tale. Excellent job. Highly recommend.,1284076800,,155,5.0
2931456,5,B000V6LSL8,"This is a review of Night Watch and Day Watch. I knew nothing at all about these movies; they simply came up as an Amazon recommendation and I ordered them. This (the two movies taken as one film) is one of the most interesting and exciting (weird and odd) movies I have ever seen. Another reviewer here gave this movie a low rating because (he said) he did not understand what was going on. For me, that was part of the fun. Mysterious events happen . . . peculiar characters behave in unexplained ways. As the movie progresses, one is rewarded by solving the mysteries . . . and explaining the (previously) unexplained. The constant surprises and non-stop action make this movie quite a thrill ride. I look forward to the next movie in the series.",1274054400,6,749,4.514705882352941
2931467,4,B000V6LSL8,"These are both great films but for some crazy reason the American version of Night Watch is not available with a Russian sound track.  If you want to get Night Watch in Russian then order it from Amazon UK - the soundtrack is in Russian and there are subtitles in English and the Scandinavian languages. Also the European version has an extra character who has been cut from the American version. You will need to have an ""all region"" DVD player to play this as the discs are Region 2 (Europe and Russia). If you have an old DVD player then it will play as all region, they have only had regional DVD players in the US for about 4 years. If you have a Cyber Home DVD player then it can be converted to all region by checking the internet for the code to type into the player. Americans are the only people who have to put up with this regional stuff introduced by Hollywood; everyone in Europe just converts their players to ""all-region"" so they can play DVDs from anywhere in the world.",1254182400,13,987,4.335135135135135
2931468,2,B000V6LSL8,"I am going to preface this with the fact that I think the books are absolutely amazing. Easily in my top 5 for fiction. I just watched this about an hour ago with my dad, and he had absolutely no idea at all what was going on in the movie. They cut out or changed a lot of the parts in the book that actually explain what the story is about. Movies have to cram a lot of material into an hour and half, I understand that. The problem is that...its almost like the director couldn't keep a coherent thought on what he wanted to do. It wouldn't be that bad if the acting had been at least decent. And I cant figure out why everyone is raving about the special effects. The truck driving around Moscow is just fast forwarded film, and it shows...horribly. Anton constantly mumbles so you need to turn the volume up very loud. As soon as its loud enough to hear what he is mumbling the special effects are deafening. Its an embarrassing movie to watch. I actually had to explain the whole story to my dad after we finished the film, since the movie could not.",1248912000,3,1055,4.227722772277228
2931469,5,B000V6LSL8,"These two movies were fun to watch. It is always interesting to watch foreign films. There was a lot of action, but not too much. The plot and storyline were original. Great package for a movie buff!!",1248912000,,200,4.4324324324324325
2931470,3,B000V6LSL8,"The film is quite good. Better that I expected for a foreign fantasy film.
I suggest getting the two DVD pack to view the whole story.
I believe there is a third component in book form available as well.
Special effects are good, but too few. The car racing across the front of a building was very good.

I bought this because the concept of a truce between the forces of good an evil  maintained in today's world intrigued me.

The characters are interesting.
But I must say that I was lost looking for the motivations behind some of the characters.
I attribute this to cultural differences.

I think a Hollywood remake would make it a major film.",1246924800,2,648,4.466101694915254
2931471,5,B000V6LSL8,"Night Watch/ Day Watch are vividly choreographed Russian action horror/thrillers with vampires and shape-shifters. It's similar to the Matrix with in-between worlds unseen by mere mortals and the never ending theme of good versus evil where the line between is not clear cut.  The characters are flawed, creepy and sometimes humorous. Watch them in sequence to make sense of the story line, but definetly watch them.",1245715200,,416,5.303030303030303
2931472,3,B000V6LSL8,"I give the movies 5 stars. They are fantastic. I am reading the books as well, although I am just on the first one.

One interesting thing is these two movies are actually based on the first of four books alone. What other book do you know of that gets two movies instead of one? That is how awesome it is.

Anyways, I give this DVD combo a rating of 3 stars (I was tempted to even give 2), because the first movie (Night Watch) is not available in Russian with the original CG subtitles. I first watched this movie on VHS, and it was in Russian with custom CG subtitles that interacted with what was going on in the movie. They were really well done, as was the Russian voice acting.

To watch it in dubbed-over English without subtitles just wasn't the same.

This was extremely disappointing.",1245196800,,795,4.351351351351352
2931473,4,B000V6LSL8,"Ok, I'm not saying these movies are ""must-see"" material, but I finally checked them out on Netflix and I was pleasantly surprised. I had already heard of these movies almost a year ago, but I just never got around to them until now (that they've been released on BD).
They were both made by the same guy who made the movie Wanted this summer, the movie with Angelina Jolie & James McAvoy.

The reason I wasn't expecting much was because these movies happen to be action/sci-fi/fantasy foregin films and that's a very rare thing since most foregin films are low-budget and/or dramas. Plus, I don't think I've even ever seen a Russian movie before now.

So Night Watch is the first one and Day Watch the sequel.
I would loosely describe them as a cross between The Matrix, Underworld, and Harry Potter.  I read that they're supposed to be 2 parts of a trilogy, but after seeing them both I have no idea what they'd do in a 3rd. To me these movies go with each other kinda like Kill Bill vol. 1 & vol. 2. Because together they make one solid story. Day Watch is virtually impossible to understand unless you have seen the 1st one.
But even though they are 1 continuous story, Night Watch has a much darker tone & ironically Day Watch has a more light-hearted tone (at times). And if you happen to watch the English dub version like I did, it actually works out pretty good b/c for once the English voices sound rather believable. (And the English subs actually match the spoken English dialouge). Since I'm sure this movie was made on a budget not even comparable to American films, I'd say the effects are rather impressive.

I would describe the movies further, but while on the one hand tjey seem rather original, they really does borrow a lot of their style, substance, and content from the 3 movies I mentioned earlier. Slick looking action scenes, hidden world within the human world, many supernatural happenings, and at times a complicated plot to follow with a lot of double crossing and hidden agendas. At times you almost have to take notes to keep up with the story.

So there you go, take it or leave it. Together I'll give them both a 4 out of 5. Check 'em out if you're in the mood for that kinda thing.",1221350400,,2215,4.4727722772277225
2931474,1,B000V6LSL8,"I don't know why people rated this so highly (Evil Dead was another one). I thought it was amateurish and boring.  If they are supposed to be so bad that they are ""campish"" I might understand it, but if it was meant to be a serious attempt at scaring me, fugedaboutit. I quickly donated it to Goodwill.",1218931200,3,302,4.298245614035087
