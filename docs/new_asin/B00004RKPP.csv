7921393,5,B00004RKPP,"I was fortunate to have the seen the entire film elsewhere on-line and now want to own it---UFA (the German equivalent of Warner, Fox, 20th) put out so many great musicals, comedies and dramas during the war, to entertain the masses and keep their spirits up, even while Germany was being bombarded heavily by the Allies---this film is this one of the best, and Marika Rokk was the best of the best when it came to dancing, singing and comedy---as Janine, she steals the show (and everyone's heart) from the preposterous Yvette, and finds her true love after a hilarious identity mix-up---please, please, please, someone make this film available thru Amazon on DVD in a U.S.-viewable format---I'll snap it up in a heartbeat!",1266278400,,724,4.894308943089431
