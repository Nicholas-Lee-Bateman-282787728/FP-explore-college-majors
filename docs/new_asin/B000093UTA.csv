7989034,5,B000093UTA,"'Bad Breed One: King Of The Mountain' includes the full 8 man 'King of the Mountain' tournament of fights, including UFC vets Nick Diaz and Jeremy Jackson, along with a super fight between Brian Ebersole and Bret 'The Angry Hick' Bergmark.  It also has training with Tank Abbot and an in depth interview with Monte Cox.  This DVD was excellent, and exceeded my expectations.  I would recommend it to any UFC, Pride or MMA fan.  I will probably now be getting the rest of the Bad  Breed DVDs.",1156204800,2,491,4.534090909090909
7989035,5,B000093UTA,"Your out of your mind!! This was one of the best independent fight DVD i've seen. It has an 8-man tournament and after fighting 2 other guys that night the winner knock his opponent out in devastating fashion - this is one of my favorites and I have many BJJ & MMA dvd including UFC, Pride, KOTC, ROTR, IFC etc.",1145404800,,311,4.2
7989036,1,B000093UTA,"I do BJJ & Judo and bought this hoping to see a lot of fights.  But this is not a fight dvd - it is primarily a behind the scenes look at some tournaments interspersed with boring shots of someone getting a tattoo and also has some big name interviews.  This DVD will disappoint anyone who has seen any Pride, KOTC or UFC tapes/DVDs.  I am big fan of these three promotions and I have various other fight DVDs with a large collection of DVDs and videos totaling about 700 fights. This DVD ranks as one of the worst I have bought in terms of content. The disappointment is ballooned by the fact that the price is too high on a per fight basis.  Even the big name interviews disappoint - good fighters do sometimes make good interviews, but not on this DVD.  Good points - the opening shots counting 42 Muay Thai leg kicks in a very one-sided fight were notable, Poppa Schnake is a charismatic person (but he is not worth the huge amount of time given as he says nothing of note), and i cannot think of any more good points.  I have now given this DVD to a friend just to see the 42 kicks and do not want it back.  Save your money and wait for the new Pride, KOTC or UFC 43 DVDs coming out soon.",1075852800,2,1193,4.116379310344827
