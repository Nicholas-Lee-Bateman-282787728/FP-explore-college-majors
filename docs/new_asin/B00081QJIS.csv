8186017,5,B00081QJIS,"Rin Tin Tin is one of my favorite movie characters, so be definition I loved this movie. I've always found him much more interesting than Lassie.

This is an interesting type of film as well.  Unlike most westerns, you don't get a lot of white hat/dark hat confrontation. Instead you get a mystery story that just happens to be set in the time of the old west.

The mix of the two generes is origninal and allows the story to develop in unexpected and interesting ways.",1146787200,,469,4.430232558139535
