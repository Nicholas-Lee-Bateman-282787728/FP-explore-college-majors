6991133,5,B00SK7B1PI,"I own all sets of this series and it's the best ever. Perfect it you want to brush up on your Italian, but there are English subtitles so even if the language doesn't appeal to you, you will still enjoy this show. The characters are very believable; they start to feel like people you know. The acting is outstanding. Good humor. Good story lines.",1440201600,,347,4.4375

6991135,5,B00SK7B1PI,"I love all Terence Hill films and the Don Matteo and Un Passo Dal Cielo series is his best works. Mr. Hill and his partner actor Bud Spencer have made some of the best films in Italy. If you like to laugh their films are for you. I hope Don Matteo will continue in the future, and we can see the rest of the series on dvd's.",1436572800,,324,3.8507462686567164
6991136,5,B00SK7B1PI,Love these stories. But is there no Set 11?????,1433808000,,47,4.333333333333333
6991137,2,B00SK7B1PI,"Disappointed that they repeated episodes on each CD, so I've actually paid twice for the same shows.  Not good business practice!!!",1430179200,,131,5.238095238095238
6991138,5,B00SK7B1PI,"Wish I could get Season 7, 8 and 9 on DVD...Shows are 3-5 years old and still not for sale on DVD?",1429228800,,98,3.5
6991139,5,B00SK7B1PI,"This series is such a splendid set that I wish I could give it ten stars! The episodes are quite entertaining and if you watch enough episodes I  think it virtually impossible not to be enamored with the characters; after awhile you feel like you are looking in on family and friends.

While crime, including of course murder, establishes the plot line for each episode, we are mercifully spared the gory and grisly scenes that most other shows of our era insist on displaying. There is no sensationalism in the crime scenes. Even dealing with serious matters the shows manage to inject humor and frivolity; think of a Father Brown/Jessica Fletcher combination to envision Don Matteo. This priest always to impart some wisdom to the perpetrators, whether drawn from the saints or philosophers of good will, and his focus is more on redemption and forgiveness rather than punishment. He always mages to ascertain the guilty party, however, (much to the chagrin of his Caribinieri friends who are one step behind!) and insists on appropriate punishment. No value-free environment here!

If you are looking for violent scenes, fights, blood-letting and cursing wrapped in an oversexed environment this series isn't for you. If you want wholesome entertainment, beautiful Italian scenery and people whom you can identify with through each 50 minute episode, this will do nicely!",1427932800,4,1374,5.125
6991140,5,B00SK7B1PI,I love watching the Don Matteo series!  I am already anxiously awaiting the next sets to get me through seasons 7 and 8.,1427414400,4,120,4.217391304347826
6991141,5,B00SK7B1PI,"This is the last four episodes of season 5 and the first 8 episodes of season 6. So if you think you are getting season 10 you are not, this is SET 10. I really appreciate how Don Matteo interacts with people. And the tension in each series between Don Matteo and the police captain. Who also cannot appreciate Don Matteo's relationship with Cecchini, as well as his parishioner's?  Don Matteo often frustrates the character of the captain because he figures out crimes like most people figure out a word puzzle in the paper.
Note the four episodes of season 5 are with  the other captain Anceschi and the mayor Laura . Season 6 is when you get the newer captain Tommasi and his fianc&eacute;e Amanda. I personally cannot wait for the episodes with Tommasi and Patrizia. However Don Matteo is the Italian version of Father Dowling mysteries with Tom Bosley. With the scenery of Gubbio and all the lovely customs and characteristics of Italy.
I  respectfully wish instead of selling this series in sets they would sell them as seasons.",1425600000,28,1034,4.701657458563536

8698701,5,B00SK7B1PI,"I love the series. I have 13 of the fifteen produced.  I usually paid about $25.00 plus for each set.  I was stunned to see the major price increase.  I only need sets 9 and 14.  One said it wasn't available and they didn't know when or if it would ever be. The other was $74.50.  That was quite a price raise.  Maybe it's because it is not available like it was earlier when it first came out.  I hope maybe the price will lower significantly.
Thanks. Tanya B.",1530748800,,461,4.112359550561798

8698706,5,B00SK7B1PI,Like I said with all of the sets - these area great for someone who ever wanted to travel to Italy's small towns and or for someone who likes detective programs without all the gruesome details of images that are unnecessary to get the point across. I love Italy and lived in Sicily for 2 four year tours. I love the details in the Don Matteo series. I feel like I am back in Sicily living and my heart sings songs of joy. Simple pleasures . . . the subtitles help me to recall the language. I love these series.,1458518400,,512,4.13
