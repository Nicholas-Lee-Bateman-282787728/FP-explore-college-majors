8483225,5,B005QC64P2,"Is one of the most enjoyable movies about West Point and its traditions from the beginning (after the revolutionary war). George Montgomery plays Joe Dawson (a back woodsman from Kentucky) who becomes an Army cadet, Maureen O'Hara plays Carolyn Bainbridge (an a arisocratic belle) who captures Montgomery's eye. John Sutton plays Howard Shelton, a stuck up colonial aristocratic landowner who applies to West Point as a cadet. This movies shows the hardships, triumphs and antics during the days at West Point after the Revolutionary War. Definitely worth watching and owning if you are a movie collector.",1401148800,2,605,5.3125

We've been looking to buy it for years, and I guess we will have to continue our search.  They sure don't make movies like this anymore!",1387929600,,249,4.3478260869565215
8483227,5,B005QC64P2,"One of DH's favorite movies ever. Says he's always liked it, but it is very hard to find. George Montgomery, Maureen O'Hara, and an interesting time period in the U.S., early to mid 1800's. And special for anyone interested in West Point and it's history. Old fashioned but good film",1374278400,2,283,4.68
8483228,4,B005QC64P2,"I ordered this movie on April 03, 2013. It finally arrived April 24, 2013, within stated delivery date. Received email stating product was shipped April 06, 2013 from Lonoke AR to Fort Smith, AR. I think the seller could improve on their delivery reliability. Product was received as stated and professional done. Video quality is so, so, but you can't expect HD from a 1942 B/W movie. I am very satisfied with the movie and quality. Only gave 4 stars due to discrepancy in date shipped vs date arrived. Something is not right. I noticed this seller has less than 5 stars due to their delivery. I would purchase again from this seller, but not satisfied with shipping choices. I would have paid more for quicker delivery options.",1366761600,,729,4.703125
