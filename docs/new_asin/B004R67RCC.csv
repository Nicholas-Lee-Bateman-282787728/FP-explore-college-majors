4457287,1,B004R67RCC,"With up-and-coming British stars including Aaron Johnson (""Kick-Ass"" ""Nowhere Boy"") and an immediate subject matter of the internet, ""Chatroom"" (2010), a new film from director Hideo Nakata (original Japanese version of ""The Ring"" and ""Dark Water""), is more like a psychological thriller than a horror. This is not surprising as Nakata has already directed a psychological thriller ""The Incite Mill"" (2009) in Japan. Well, I hate to say this, but after watching his latest film, I am beginning to think that he has lost his touch.

The story centers on a group of teenagers meeting at a chatroom named ""Chelsea teens!"" - William (Aaron Johnson), Jim (Matthew Beard), Eva (Imogen Poots), Emily (Hannah Murray) and Mo (Daniel Kaluuya) - all of whom have problems in their real life. As the five chatroom members meet more frequently each other online, some of them find themselves drawn to the dark side of their personality. And perhaps someone with a malicious intent is encouraging them ....

One novel idea of the film (based on a play by Enda Walsh) is that the ""chatroom"" is shown as a physical room. This means the five characters physically enter a small room and ""chat"" there. The scenes go back and forth between the real world (where the characters are seen watching PC screen) and the internet world (where they are seen talking to one another ""in person""). It is certainly unique.

The novelty soon wears off, however, and the film descends quickly into dullness. Besides the shaky narrative that switches between the two worlds, the film suffers from a lack of tension throughout, caused by one-dimensional portrayals of the main characters, and the logical lapses in their online interactions. In short - whether on the net or off - you just need better skills to manipulate someone else than are shown here. You have to be cunning and calculating, always seeing through your target's mind. Yelling over someone's head is not enough, especially when acting is not very good.

With clumsy storytelling, underdeveloped and superficial interpretation of the titular topic, and the too obvious message about the downside of internet communication, ""Chatroom"" has nothing really interesting to offer except the visual gimmick of the chatroom.",1314576000,3,2250,5.0894308943089435
4457288,3,B004R67RCC,The three things that made me watch this movie till the end were: 1. Cinematography was great and creative given most of the movie was set in rooms. 2. The music was cool and to the beat. 3. The acting from all actors (especially Johnson) was pretty good. But all in all the the storyline was good but could've been executed better and the ending left me asking: that was it?,1313107200,6,375,4.295774647887324
4457289,3,B004R67RCC,"""Don't you have any real friends?""  When loner William (Johnson) decides to start up a chatroom with other teens that are withdrawn they think they have a place where they can be themselves.  Soon William begins to manipulate them and the fun for him begins.  This is a very strange movie.  Not a terrible movie, but very slow moving for what it is.  William is unbelievably psychotic and Johnson does a great job of making him seem very creepy.  The other members are not really innocent and have thier own problems, and each actor does a good job of playing them.  This movie is not so much scary as it is disturbing and hard to watch in some parts.  Be ready for a couple shocking scenes that will be hard for you forget right away.  Nothing really special and if you want a scary movie there are better options.  I have a feeling that the stuff that happens in this movie probebly happens more then is reported. Overall not bad, more disturbing then anything.  I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - I doubt it.",1307750400,6,1015,4.3689839572192515

Little did I know it starred Aaron Taylor Johnson (KickAss), Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out and Black Panther) and was Directed by Hideo Nakata (Original Ringu Movie).

It's not perfect for sure, but the plot line and execution of Chatrooms as physical Rooms was pretty Clever. Better underlying development of each Kids Issues would have given it some more depth, but I watch a LOT of movies in this Genre. And, if like me, you also wade through a LOT of tough movies to get all the way through.

But I can confidently recommend, Chatroom is a  pretty decent Movie to watch if you like the Genre. There's certainly some unique aspects to it, and anymore that's enough reason alone.
