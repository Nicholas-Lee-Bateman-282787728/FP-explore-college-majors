8295611,5,B001DZN63O,"All I can say is the less you read about this movie, the better. I have yet to see anyone write a review about Sway that doesn't give away the entire plot and ending for the sake of analysis. Read those after you've watched it.

Although Nishikawa is adored by critics and her movies routinely win awards both domestically and abroad, she's probably under-appreciated by fans. Her stories have emotional depth and subtle twists that leave you thinking long after the movie is over. Sway is a prime example of this. Hopefully her 2009 film ""Dear Doctor"" will get released in North America someday too.

For the most part, Teruyuki Kagawa is great in everything he does, but this was the movie where Odagiri truly broke out as an actor and not just a cool leading man type. He obviously takes film acting very seriously and that's an increasingly rare attitude in Japan.",1338854400,3,868,4.666666666666667
8295612,3,B001DZN63O,"Takeru (Jo Odagiri)is a celebrity photographer in Tokyo and younger brother of Minoru (Teruyuki Kagawa).  They are the offspring of Isamu Hayakawa (Masato Ibu), who owns the local gas station.  Minoru works at the gas station.  Minoru is kind, gentle, and responsible: the typical good guy. Takeru is a player.  On the one year anniversary of their mother's death, Takeru visits his hometown. His girlfriend at the time, Chieko (Yoko Maki)now works at the gas station.  Minoru likes Chieko, Chieko still has feelings for Takeru. For one night, Takeru has feelings for Chieko. The three go an outing at the waterfalls. Chieko dies. Minoru is arrested.

Since Takeru's return, Minoru has been the peacekeeper between Takeru and Isamu.  But after the arrest, it is the other way around. The synpopsis on the cover reads, ""years of suppressed anger and betrayal come to the surface, revealing a gulf of jealousy and resentment between the brothers that threatens to tear their family apart.""

The synopsis is the action that is displayed on the screen. The night before Takeru is to testify at the trial, he argues with Minoru. Then at the trial, he says what he is saying is to get his brother back.

The last scene does bring the story together, and it is so subtle that it is easy to miss. During their argument, Minoru says something to Takeru about Takeru's personality.  The ending didn't make sense to me until I remembered that exchange.  The result is that Takeru realizes it is not Minoru who had to be redeemed, but himself.",1277510400,2,1531,4.827586206896552
