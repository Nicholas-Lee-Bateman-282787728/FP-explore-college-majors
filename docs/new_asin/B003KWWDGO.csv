8398987,5,B003KWWDGO,One hot rocking  smoking heavy blues concert video.  This one packs a punch like few others can deliver. I was very impressed with the whole performance. I bought it out of curiosity.  Man am I glad I picked this up.  Sound quality is above average and video is ok.  Play this one very loud if your speakers can handle it.  My Klipsh's can....,1443484800,,343,4.365079365079365
8398988,4,B003KWWDGO,"I grew up listening to cactus they consisted of two members of the vanilla fudge and Jim McCarty from the Detroit wheels original singer Rusty day is not on this DVD but his replacement does a fine job if you like cactus but never saw them live I would get this DVD, there's only a few things that are not right about this DVD, the person who shot it fooled around too much with throwing in special-effects during some numbers but the music is great",1437609600,,449,4.294117647058823
8398989,5,B003KWWDGO,Great insight to this group. I just wished that there was some live footage of Rusty Day even if it were only an interview. Video gives a better view of someones persona than just audio alone. The new line-up is kicking and I'd love to see them live in a concert setting myself.,1435449600,,278,4.264150943396227
8398990,4,B003KWWDGO,"Outstanding, hard hitting blues/boogie band!
You can find no better band in this department.
Jim McCarty is a great guitarist, just GREAT!",1373760000,,138,5.318181818181818
8398991,3,B003KWWDGO,"The concert is great. I love the music. Video and sound quality are pretty good, but not great. Still very watchable.  So why 3 stars ? The cheesy post production edits that are interposed on the video of the concert are just ridiculous. Example, the color flashes superimposed on the video during ""One Way or Another"" are not only annoying, they detract from the live feel of the concert. Are they intended to simulate an acid trip or something? Whatever. They suck. Another example, superimposing bats, skeletons and other halloween crap on the video during ""Evil"" is not only childish, it misses the point of the song. Evil is not about goblins. It's about the bad things going on in the head of the guy who is the subject of the song. ""I'm warnin' you brother, you better watch your happy home"" is not a suggestion that his house is haunted, it's about what he might do to destroy his family and relationships by his actions while he is away from home. Then to top it all off, the pictures of children flashed on the screen during ""Rock And Roll Children"" made me want to throw up. I can't believe the band allowed this kind of post production crap on an otherwise outstanding concert video. It's like some moron got his hands on a cheap video editing program and just went ape s***. I still like the concert and would recommend it, but boy, what I would give for an unedited version of the entire show.",1369526400,5,1407,4.49609375
8398992,5,B003KWWDGO,The most underrated yet influential rock band in history. I'm not gonna waste your time. Buy this dvd NOW! These guys are still one of the all time heaviest blues rock quartets in history. They haven't lost a thing!,1362268800,,215,4.538461538461538
8398993,5,B003KWWDGO,"Wow, 40 years... some of the faces have changed, but the heart of Cactus--drum god Carmine Appice, bass legend Tim Bogert, and guitar hero Jim McCarty--remain in place, supplemented by vocalist Jimmy Kunes (ex-Savoy Brown) and harmonica player Randy Pratt. This DVD was filmed during the band's `reunion' (of sorts) tour of 2006/07, at BB King's in New York, and it is a thrilling testament to the greatness of Cactus, the original US masters of heavy blues rock. OK, live DVD, sitting at home, having a good time... but when the band kicks in to `Evil' (followed by an amazing demonstration of drum supremacy from Appice) and when they close the show with a blistering take on `Parchman Farm', it's more of an on-your-feet, having a GREAT time vibe! Bonus features include an incredible jam at the annual NAMM convention with Pat Travers, Warren Haynes, and Joe Bonamassa joining in for an out-of-this-world run through `Oleo'; the music video for `The Groover' (a song from this line-up's `Cactus V' album of 2006, which I heartily endorsed in MM awhile back); band interviews; and testimonials about the legend and influence of Cactus from Ty Tabor (King's X), Uli Jon Roth, Vinnie Moore,  of Anvil, and members of bands ranging from Arch Enemy and Megadeth to Red Hot Chili Peppers. THIS is rock `n' roll.",1293926400,7,1309,4.869955156950673
