2317575,5,B0009SCV7I,"Who knew skip/rope jumping could be so interesting?  When I first watched this DVD (I watched it without skipping to begin with) I was blown away at the variety and expertise of rope jumping.  I also wondered if I'd ever be able to actually do the moves - it looked difficult.  I realised that as I was an inexperienced rope jumper, my skipping was not up to this level. I needed to buy the beginner DVD.  It was definitely worth the money.  The beginner DVD shows you all the different moves and gives you tips on how to learn them.

This DVD more or less assumes you know the moves & gives you a workout.  I'm steadily working my way through learning all the moves - you don't need to be able to do them all before doing this Advanced Workout - just modify the workout.  I try and learn one different move each week - of course some you get very easily and others require a little more persistence.

I liked this Advanced Workout DVD - it's a quality presentation that has a motivating workout.  Eric Niles is a very reassuring and encouraging trainer (by the way, he can really skip!).  I also like the CD that matches this workout (an additional purchase).  You can save it to your iPod and workout anywhere - very handy.  Thoroughly recommend this DVD BUT if you haven't done ropesport before it's worth buying the beginner DVD first.  One things for sure, the more I skip, the more my fitness improves and my skipping ability.

One further important item - the jump rope.  You have to have the right type.  Plastic or leather jump ropes don't do the job.  I've got both and Eric Niles states on his beginner DVD that you need the right rope.  He's right, the plastic or leather ones are not flexible enough & get tangled up too easily.  I purchased my jump rope from the jumprope website.",1189123200,15,1794,4.395136778115502
2317576,5,B0009SCV7I,"I love this workout tape.

I started with the Ropesport intermediate DVD and moved up to this one. It's a great half hour workout with a variety of jumps. The intermediate stops and starts, but this one has a quick ten minutes of jumping and you've already started working up a sweat by the time the warm up exercises start.

If you get bored with the jumps featured in the video you can add different ones, detailed in the DVD (the intermediate DVD has a bunch of alternative jumps as well, which I actually prefer more).

Yes, the ""celebrities"" are annoying and the participants in the tape yell and whoop so much that it becomes annoying, but considering how good the actual workout is, I've gotten over these annoyances. (And to be truthful there aren't that many jumprope DVDs, so there's no alternative but to adjust.)",1170979200,22,824,4.63013698630137
8066128,5,B0009SCV7I,"Great dvd!  Start with the Basic one, then progress to the Intermediate one before attempting this one.  Good production!",1415923200,,121,5.315789473684211
8066129,4,B0009SCV7I,"Good instruction, but would prefer a little more explanation and video on the more difficult moves. Overall a good product.",1357257600,,123,5.2
8066130,5,B0009SCV7I,"I purchased this along with the Intermediate DVD. This workout is great! You are sweating within the first 10 minutes of the DVD. I am a very active person who takes boxing classes, does spinning classes, and runs. This workout has proved to be very challenging. If you find some of the jumps to fancy, you can modify to do what you feel comfortable with. I like this workout better than the intermediate because there is a push-up and ab routine after you are done jumping. You get a great total body workout in less time! I do this at least 3 times per week in addition to my other activities. Great DVD!",1315440000,3,606,4.371681415929204
8066131,1,B0009SCV7I,"This went straight into the trash.
I buy many workout dvds and this was the worst one I have ever seen.",1260748800,,103,3.9523809523809526
8066132,4,B0009SCV7I,I went from the beginner  Ropesport DVD straight to the Advanced and am glad I did.  I was having to replay the beginner DVD at least 3 times to get the results I wanted.  The workout on this DVD is longer and has some fun (new to me) exercises; that I'm still trying to master.  I love it I can get my heart rate up and keep it up as long as I want or slow down and not miss a beat.  I definatley recommend this after you've mastered the beginner DVD.,1236384000,,452,3.869565217391304
8066133,3,B0009SCV7I,"I thought that ""Advanced Workout"" meant that it was for individuals who were prepared for a challenge, but the workout felt really short and I barely reached my exercise heart rate zone. Additionally, it didn't seem very planned out. The cast frequently would just start doing their own thing. It was fun, even without a jumprope, but I cannot believe that you're burning 1,000 calories an hour. I thought the most challenging part of the workout were the last couple minutes of abdominal exercises and push-ups.

Overall, it was a decent DVD, but nothing impressive. At least the guy was sexy.",1234656000,3,594,4.881188118811881
8066134,4,B0009SCV7I,"If you enjoy jump rope for a great workout like I do ( too much running hurts my knees), then you will like this dvd. I've been doing jump rope for years, and even shop on line for the best jump ropes I can find. I have 5 different ropes.
Anyway, you are taken thru a thorough warm up, a light stretch, then into the actual workout. It is composed of interval training, you'll do a little hard core jumping, then a little easy jumping. The jump tricks can be as fancy or plain as you like. At the end, you finish with push ups and ab work and of course a stretch. Run time for the dvd is about 50 mins. There are ""extras"" like a segment on how to perform the jumps in case you don't have the other dvd's in the series.
Production value is very good, it is a professional studio with great sound and lighting and camera work. The music is awesome, it kept you moving. The cueing by the instructors is good, there are 8 other people in the background jumping too. I don't have the other dvd's in the series, but I will be getting them. I think you'll like this dvd.",1227830400,2,1063,4.090909090909091
8066135,5,B0009SCV7I,"I to skip the basic workout.  Although I cannot jump using the jumprope, I use the handles and I get an excellent workout.  I especially enjoy doing the situps at the end.  I can really feel it in my abs.  I really enjoy working out and its important to find something that you really enjoy doing.",1208217600,2,297,4.25
8066136,1,B0009SCV7I,"Thought I would as I'm not like most ordinary people - love jumprope. But there was definitely too much talking.

Also there should be more options provided if you're:
a. not in possession of a jump-rope, or can't use it where you are for some reason
b. not picking up the moves as quickly
c. more advanced moves

I'll use it every now and then - not a total loss!",1204502400,,364,4.185714285714286
8066137,5,B0009SCV7I,"I really like this workout! I had my doubts at first with the celebrity hoopla, but don't be fooled.  You don't have to use a jumprope to get the full benefits. I kept hitting myself in the face with the rope in my tiny workout room so I opted for cutting two lengths of rope about 1 foot long. It works really well and I'm not hitting myself in the face anymore. It feels good to get such a great cardio workout. I keep getting a better workout each time since I'm getting the footwork down and feeling more confident.",1196640000,8,519,4.19
