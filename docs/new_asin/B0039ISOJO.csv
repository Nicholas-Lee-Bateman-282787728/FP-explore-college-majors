By being on shows like this, they probably get the help they need without having to pay for it - in fact they get paid to be in it. This kind of show can and should be a warning to people who use some of these serious substances. This kind of show shows what's involved in rehab, and that it's not a perfect cure. People have to be responsible for their own recovery to a large degree.
Also, by having various stars who most people have some connection to personalises the shows. I especially relate to Mackenzie Philips (Season 3)... and the rock musicians.",1419811200,2,636,4.398305084745763

8392072,4,B0039ISOJO,"I bought Season 3 of Celebrity Rehab mainly because of Mike Starr, of one of the cast members of the show. I was so sad to hear about his passing due to drug addiction and I also bought this DVD because I never saw the entire season when it was on TV a couple of years back.
This season is the same as the other previous seasons of Celeb Rehab and you should buy this if you are a fan of the show or you want to learn more about addiction. Sadly, many people see this show as mainly entertainment, but people have to understand that the cast members are human beings that do suffer from addictions and they are the same as people that aren't famous. People should push the fame aspect away and really focus on the pain that the cast members are expressing through their treatment at the Pasadena Recover Center.",1320019200,11,811,4.2727272727272725
