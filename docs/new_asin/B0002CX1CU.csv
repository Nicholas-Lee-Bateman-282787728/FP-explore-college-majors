2077413,5,B0002CX1CU,"I was privileged to be one of the ""independent"" contributors to this movie/DVD.  Demon turned out so much better than I could have ever imagined.  It's not ""Oscar""-worthy, but it was never meant to be.  The movie definitely makes you think and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  Jason and Garett both brought life to their roles in a marvelous and actually believable way.  I may be biased due to my involvement, but I still think it's a really good movie and encourage open minds and imaginations when viewing.",1149638400,3,532,4.557894736842106
2077414,4,B0002CX1CU,"Demon Under Glass

  Well, I won't use the sweeping phrase ""best vampire movie I ever saw,"" but I will term this unheralded DVD the most interesting of the genre. Made possible by an entity called ""Dragoncor/EarthDragon,"" the film-makers definitely put forth a lot of intellectual effort, and, in doing so, offset the underfunded production values with considerable success. Their cerebral approach? Attempting to attach intriguing scientific explanation to enduring legend; placing supernatural manifestation under the microscope in an attempt to unravel the secrets of a scary phenomenon.

  The movie starts off with a briefly written explanation: A serial killer is loose in Los Angeles. Nicknamed ""Vlad"" by the media due to the distinctively gruesome condition of his victims, the murderous criminal is very soon caught in a prostitution sting, then abruptly confronted by a mysterious task force of the U.S. Government. In a running, pitched battle, the hypothetical vampire is brought to heel and then whisked away to the research section of a VA Hospital.

  This unknown, frighteningly dangerous creature becomes the centerpiece of a research project code-named ""Delphi."" Soon enough the captive earns the term ""living impossibility"" by the lead scientist, a man who readily blinds himself to risk because of an insatiable thirst for hidden knowledge. Amidst a series of discoveries that unfold in an environment rife with tension-surprising revelations that turn the known mechanics of human physiology upside down-one significant yet slowly revealed ""revelation"" is grasped too, too slowly by the people who think they hold all the cards: ""Vlad"" can be persuasive, insidiously so. Secure doors, one-way mirrors and ever-present guards just might not be up to the challenge of keeping him down.

  With the overview of this good horror picture out of the way-a production cast and crew alike should be proud of-I will mention here some of the nagging defects that briefly bothered my eye, tickled my ear and caused my brain to spasm during what was largely a superb effort that bore plentiful fruit.

The action scenes at the beginning of the movie could have been choreographed a bit more professionally. I guess such flaws are to be expected; this was definitely a film whose ""shoe-string budget"" put a damper on the visuals.

  The security barriers that kept the outside world away from the research project were ludicrously inadequate; from what I gathered, there was but one: A nurse behind a desk, who seemed to be constantly on the phone. That hardly makes for an effective deterrent against potential intruders, especially anyone who might be motivated to track down a notorious serial killer; a shadowy figure whose results were widely known to the media and certainly impacted the victims' survivors.

  It struck me as oddly puzzling how dense and callous one of the leads-a bright and caring young internist-could act at times. First, it took him far too long to link the strange man under his care-a position, admittedly, that was thrust upon him-with the killer tagged ""Vlad"" by the media. (Maybe because he was so busy seeing to Veterans, he never had the chance to read the papers before the real deal itself showed up and altered his life forever.) Second, he started cooling to the creature a bit late in the game. I mean, any person with the moral fiber this man obviously possessed would have suspected from the get-go his enigmatic patient's fresh blood needs more than likely involved a history of murder.

  On top of the youngest doctor's briefly strange lapses, two of his senior cohorts' behavior toward the end also threw me for a loop. Suffice to say the effort to advance the study had one acting in rapid succession fiendishly appalling than brutally uncaring; the other reached disgustingly culpable shortly after oozing a stench of wimpish criminality. (I guess ""Vlad"" could have been acting telepathically behind the scenes, but, if so, I must have missed that angle entirely.)

  Finally, there were a few significant loose strings still hanging at the closing credits. I don't want to get into too much detail here, because it might spoil crucial aspects of the story, but Vlad's past doings could have been explored and explained a bit more comprehensively.

  In this last paragraph I do feel compelled to end on a positive note. I mean, it's the least I can do, since I did enjoy the film, very much so. All the actors throughout, despite the aforementioned inconsistencies in behavior and ""Vlad's"" elegant darkness, struck me as everyday people with everyday good looks realistically and believingly confronting an alluring yet disturbing mystery. No ""ravishing divas, incomparably handsome leading men and celebrated acting skills"" of the big budgeted movies here. These actors, in an understated professionalism, duplicated very closely what one would expect to see in the environment and situations presented.

  (Okay, I lied!! There is one more complaint, and it's not just for this movie: Military guards, who find themselves in imminently hostile environments, are not in the least likely to remain at parade rest incessantly, staring straight ahead and needlessly tiring themselves out, thus being less than fully prepared for danger when it strikes!)

""Vamp gets caught by nasty Gov and gets the lab-rat routine""

Sounds like Ho-hUM.  WRONG.  VERY (!!) well made and HIGH quality independant film, well acted and scripted. Nothing new, but presented so well, you will want to watch more than a few times, if not add to your collection. More psychological than scare tactics....but it's the hook that will keep you a fan of this film.",1121817600,6,420,4.712328767123288
2077416,5,B0002CX1CU,"This was no big-budget production.  The cast and crew did not rely on special effects or large explosions.  Instead they place their faith in stellar performances by the central cast and an interesting script with a new take on the vampire mythos.  It works.

Demon Under Glass was a pleasant surprise.  Thoughtful, fun, intelligent, and insightful ... it was a pleasure to watch.  I only wish they'd filmed a sequel, because this film deserves one.

Garrett Maggart plays Dr. Joe McCay with wisdom and humanity, and his reluctant friendship with the vampire, Simon Molinar (brilliantly played by Jason Carter, who sucks the audience right in - even when you know, you just KNOW, this guy is bad news, you're still rooting for him right along with the other characters in the film, despite his ""evil"" nature), is the highlight of this story.  Neither man chooses to be there, but they deal with the situation and each other, despite a lack of trust that grows into something akin to mutual respect if not downright friendship.

The back cover of the DVD led me to believe that this would be an action pic, a battle between the police and a killer, but in truth, it is a study of what ""humanity"" is and takes place primarily in the lab where Simon is being studied.  Kudos to the film-makers for this rare and perfect choice.  It is what makes this film so special.

In my opinion, if you enjoy a fun, engaging movie, then Demon Under Glass is for you.  Watch it and enjoy.  It was wonderful!",1114300800,11,1491,4.598484848484849
2077417,3,B0002CX1CU,"Watching DEMON UNDER GLASS reminded me of the old soap opera DARK SHADOWS, only in that its filming was reminiscent of how they used to do that 70s series.  But whereas SHADOWS opted for campiness, DEMON tries to take a serious look at how we might ""capture"" a vampire and use him to study his genetic makeup and just what makes him tick.  The movie posits the question as to just who is the demon?  The vampire Vlad or the scientists who would torture him to discover how quickly his regenerative powers work.  In the film, Vlad is responsible for the deaths of several lovely prostitutes whom he brutally beats and mutilates when finished.  As he is captured, however, we see a different vampire:  he seems appreciative of the care of young Dr. McCrady; he cooperates fully; and he doesn't seem all that bad..until the obsessed doctor in charge of the program takes his experimentations a little too far.  By the end of the movie, the vampire is pleased with who and what he is, and he sees nothing wrong in needing human blood.

DEMON UNDER GLASS tries hard to be different, and in some ways, it succeeds.  The production values are very amateurish, and this does detract from the film.  Garet Maggart does well as the idealistic and conscience-stricken doctor, and Jason Carter has a certain vulnerability to match his evilness.  The rest of the cast is pretty bad, though--particularly Jack Donner as the scientist and Denise Alessandra Hurd as the police detective whose own fascination with Vlad is never fully explored.

DEMON UNDER GLASS won't make you forget the Hammer Dracula films or even Barnabas Collins, but it isn't as bad as it could have been.",1113091200,6,1662,4.732638888888889

2077419,5,B0002CX1CU,"Last year I bought my DVD and I watched the movie for the first time together with family and friends. The plot caught us from the beginning until the end. It is a plot very different to the other movies of vampires, it is original, refreshing and interesting, that made us meditate about the origen of the vampires.
The movie is not spectacular, it doesn't have special effects and it is not bloody, but it has good music and it is worthy of being seen and to have it in our collection for the only fact of the excellent plot and the magnificent performance of the actor Garett Maggart (Blair Sandburg in The Sentinel) who knew to interpret with extraordinary naturalness to the Dr. Joseph MacKay. The result, the young doctor catches and convinces to the audience of his moral dilemma, he doesn't want to hurt the vampire, but he also knows that it is an opportunity in a million to help the scientists to understand the origen of the vampires.
On the other hand, the actor Jason Carter (Babylon 5) dared to interpret a different vampire, a vampire that surprises and divert, that it is intelligent and it collaborates with the investigators; but his murderous instincts and of survival are stronger than his own reasoning.
It can be said that Garett Maggart and Jason Carter carried out for themselves the complete movie, supported by a excellent plot. Especially the performance of Garett Maggart gives the master touch to this movie, he acted very natural, fair to the height of the circumstances. In the TV show ""The Sentinel"" he had opportunity to show his big actor qualities, the one put talent and heart in the character of Blair Sandburg. In ""Demon Under Glass"" his great talent was not taken advantage of and the low quality of the photography didn't allow to capture to fullness his great histrionic capacity, but he definitively took out the movie ahead.
Demon Under Glass, good effort of independent cinema, in the one that Garett, marked the difference.
The bloopers? To see Garett so jovial and joker was for my a pretty and moving surprise.
I would like to see DUG with dubbing in Spanish and of course I would like to see DUG-2.",1089849600,8,2147,4.682539682539683
2077420,1,B0002CX1CU,"Demon Under Glass is not the worst vampire movie I've ever seen, nor is it the best. I am giving it one star because of the technical problems with the film (poor lighting, sound, etc.) not because the script or the acting was substandard.
The premise is excellent, the Delphi Project, a secret government program which was created to solve the mystery of life itself, has found a vampire subject named Simon (Jason Carter of Babylon 5) to study. The Project has two doctors, one a kind and compassionate healer named Dr. Joe McKay (Garett Maggart of The Sentinel) and the other the cliched mad scientist who only wants to exploit the vampire for his own crazy needs.
However, when a friendship begins to develop between Simon and Joe, will the good doctor try and save the vampire from the evil scientist and the now corrupt Delphi Project? And so begins the premise of the movie: Who is the Monster? The humans or the vampire?
Like I said, the movie has a good start, with a good plot and the acting is quite good (except for the gentlemen who plays the evil scientist, he's horrible beyond belief and needs to be recast if they ever do a sequel), the movie is virtually unwatchable because of the technical problems.
The lighting is bright in some scenes and low in others. Sound goes in and out in my copy of the DVD and the special effects are lame, even for a low budget horror film. And believe me I watch every low budget vampire movie out there. Vampire films are my favorite genre of horror.
The director shot on digital film and it shows. So now I understand why the film could not get a distributor. It looks like a bad home movie gone wrong. However, the cast cannot be blamed for these problems, so cut them some slack. They do everything they  possibly can with the script and work around the technical difficulties. I give them high marks for that!
If you don't expect much going into this film, you will not be disappointed. And for Jason Carter and Garett Maggart fans, it's well worth the $6.98 you'll pay for it. So buy it for that reason alone.",1088985600,14,2065,4.477453580901857

It was nice to see something that wasn't all blood, guts and gore or complete schmaltz like the Twilight series (no offence meant to those who like Twilight).

8026332,3,B0002CX1CU,"This movie wasn't flashy and didn't involve a lot of scenery.  It was more one of those films that have you discussing things after it's over.  Fans of Babylon 5 will love Jason Carter as the vampire (he seems to be doing a lot in this genre of late).  It could be considered slow, but in this ADD world I find that a bit refreshing.  The situation felt fairly realistic and some of the movie, dialog, and general concepts were just terrific.

So why only 3 stars?  Well, despite some great acting on the part of some of the players the talent was not universally shared amongst the cast.  Some were really stiff, or just plain failed at conveying their characters.  It is something when a bit part prostitute outshines several of the main actors. (very minor spoiler alert) Further the downward spiral of the main doc wasn't believable in my opinion, and neither was the final plot device designed to create the climax.  I also wasn't sure about the vampire's (Jason Carter) motivation, though I suppose some of that was the point.  Still they even mentioned during one scene in the film that if the 1000 year old vampire had been killing people like he had recently, it would have raised more flags, so maybe he wasn't the real killer.  That begs the question, why wasn't the brutal Vlad murders noticed before now?  Did the vampire escalate all of a sudden for some reason?  Did he just stop trying to hide his kills?  And if he can survive on transfused blood, why all the killing in the first place from an otherwise very sophisticated, inquisitive, and otherwise not malicious individual?

Despite the negatives, I was still entertained for the full length of the film.  I just wouldn't watch it while very tired or you many not make the ending.",1353715200,,1751,4.6

I could have forgiven the acting and the poor camera/stage setup, but the movie felt so long, I think they should have figured out a way to get the message across faster than they did, it doesn't feel like there are really any real conflicts for the first half of the movie, just simple disagreements about if things are ethical. I bought this movie looking at some of the 5 star reviews thinking it was going to be a great movie, it appeared to be a B movie, but sometimes those are the best. I took the gamble and wish I'd of just rented it instead, or went to the library and borrowed a copy of it first even.

8026335,4,B0002CX1CU,"As will appear in the February 2012 issue of Twisted Dreams Magazine...

I've been a huge fan of Jason Carter since his days on Babylon 5, as Ranger, Marcus Cole. He brought a great sense to that role, believable and comedic as well, so when I saw him as the main character in this movie, I was hooked.
 But then I saw the supporting cast...and one name stood out...Garett Maggart. Blair Sandburg will forever be one of my favorite TV characters, and to this day, I still miss the TV show, The Sentinel.
 So buying this movie was a no-brainer and I'm glad I did.
 Simon Molinar is a Vampire...a prostitute-murdering, blood-drinking psychopath...who isn't a psychopath at all...though that's a really difficult conclusion to come to, after one learns of the trail of bodies he's left in his feeding wake.
He's a Vampire...pure and simple and he simply chooses prostitutes as his food of choice.
When he's captured by the team of Dr. Hirsch (whose character is only in the movie very briefly, but his importance is NOT lost in the story) who has been studying Vampires for years and has wanted one for his own to study even more in-depth, you get a glimpse into what we all know about the human race in general...we are and can be the monsters...and much worse than the ones in fables.
Simon is extremely intelligent and patient with his treatment (and at times, torture) and even agrees to help Dr. Bassett (Donner) with the study, he swore to take up, in Dr. Hirsch's stead.
Not bad for a soulless, damned, creature of darkness.
I can tell you, while most of the acting wasn't stellar by any means, the chemistry between the murdering Vampire, Molinar (Carter) and Dr. Joe McKay (Maggart) a young doctor who finds himself in way over his head and torn between feeling sorry for his patient and later on, his guilt at helping a murderer, was nothing short of incredible.
At no time in an independently-made movie, have I seen such chemistry, such ease in acting roles that come across as completely realistic and I applaud both men.
It's a shame that neither could get the recognition they both deserved for pulling off, what had to be, uncomfortable roles for each of them.
Maggart is completely believable as a doctor and seems to slip into the role as easily as a real doctor would. If you have watched many movies with ""actor doctors"" in them, you know what I mean. Touching people seems to be rigid and embarrassing for them, not to mention wooden and distracted and caring (as doctors are supposed to be) seems to be even more so...yet Maggart pulls off a staggeringly realistic performance as the young, Dr. McKay, who wants nothing more than to take care of his patient, complete with extremely believable, hands-on ""treatment.""
It's a performance not to be missed and shows a real ""comfort"" level between the two men that one rarely gets to glimpse in major Hollywood productions, let alone in indie movies.
 I also have to say that I've read the IMDB reviews of this movie and simply don't see the necessity of the harsh reviews.
 So many people complain about bad lighting. Not sure where that came from, as I thought the lighting was more than adequate. Same for the film itself; I liked the more, ""documentary"" feel of the film rather than the antiseptic, Hollywood film that is most commonly accepted in the industry.
 I also feel that all the attacks on Jack Donner's performance are downright, stupid. He played the part of a secretly sadistic, but eager-to-learn, curious, scientist with great realty.
 All-in-all, those three characters make up for any lack of adequacy in any other parts of the movie.
 I highly recommend it.

 I give this movie a 7 out of a twisted 10 and have watched it numerous times since I purchased it and plan to watch it numerous more. Give it a watch. You won't be disappointed...

8026336,5,B0002CX1CU,"I'd like to review the film Demon Under Glass. First let me start by saying the story is good, the writing isn't bad. The Demon Under Glass film was written by the same people who wrote the novel, D. L. Warner. She actually wrote the novel at the same time as she wrote the film.  The novel however has double the plot length, and, though obscure, bears an interesting plot. The film Demon Under Glass was a low budget horror film of the early 2000s and the plot of the film is only about half the plot. First, a comparison of the film to the novel since both were written at the same time. The novel is about double the length, in regard to story content.  Demon under glass is a very unique story.

 A vampire going by the name of Simon Molinar gets captured by the government. He's kept in a high tech cell where doctors study him in secret while the general public remains unaware that vampires truly exist.  Molinar under-goes several cruel experiments which cause the reader to question: Who are the monsters here? The vampire actually befriends one of his captors, a Dr. Joe McKay.  McKay was a last minute replacement for a doctor who had been killed while they were trying to capture Molinar.  Despite being a killer, you start to see the vampire as tragic anti-hero.
  Molinar is unashamed of who and what he is and is a survivor.  You come to realize he's not the most evil being in the story.  Molinar is cruelly experimented on.  His confinement consists of a small room with a two way mirror and a metal casket-type of box that is locked from the outside while he is sleeping.  They keep him in the casket by night, throwing off his sleep pattern, as to be certain he can't escape while they are studying him by daylight (which will burn him).  One particularly cruel test is when they expose a section of his arm to varying degrees of sunlight to see how severely it would burn him and then when it is over they refuse to feed him blood as to see how quickly he can heal without feeding. After a time the group decide to destroy the vampire now that they have finished studying him.

Since he is a killer they would rather keep in captivity a specimen that has not taken human lives. It's mostly politics at this point. Molinar manages to escape and this is where the film version ends. I feel at this point D. L. Warner felt her liberty as a writer and started to stretch her legs into the world of Gothic horror / Scifi but you would have to read the novel to know the rest of the story.

It's a refreshingly unique take on the vampire story. The symbolism is a little heavy-handed. Characters like Joe McKay spell things out for you with dialog that might as well be shouts of 'The vampire's not evil! My bosses are!' The novel's ending felt like the start of an ongoing book series which never actually happened.

Other than these flaws I really do like the book and film. Te film gets points for being a verbal translation of the novel, unlike Queen of the damned, which had nothing to do with the novel of the same name or the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost which was nothing more than World War 2 propaganda.

The biggest problem with Demon Under glass is the budget must have been
a literal shoe string.

The film Demon Under Glass has a laughable budget.

The first time we see Molinar in the film it's before his capture. He's roaming a city looking for a prostitute to feed upon. the film makers had to tell us he's a vampire immediately by having him pause to lick his fangs.  The next flaw is during Simon's capture as the men are 'beating' him there is no sound. I don't know if this is meant for dramatic emphasize but it just makes it all the more obvious that they are pounding on nothing.

  The 'High tech' facility holding Molinar isn't very High tech at all. As I said, it appears to have been filmed in someone's garage and the visuals work much better in the novel. The budget was unquestionably low. The telephones used were out of the late eighties at best. Even the cell phones were out of date, looking like the lower quality ones sold in the mid-nineties, the disposable kind. I always figured a secret government agency would have nicer cell phones.  Even Joe Dawson's mobile phone on Highlander the series (1995) is more modern than what we see in Demon Under Glass. Also for a film made in 2002 and set in a high tech lab their computers look to be at least ten years old.

I like the ideas projected in Demon Under Glass. And the actual story is very good. With a higher budget this could have been a fine movie. I was disappointed that the story of the film is only half of what's in the novel though what is in the film surprisingly IS faithful to the first half of the novel. It's as faithful as you can get with a very limited budget.

If you can get past the weak moments the actual story and ideas behind it are very interesting. It's certainly a unique vampire film and I'd rather watch it than Queen of the damned or Twilight. I actually sincerely wish the Rifftrax guys (formerly Mystery Science theatre) would heckle Demon Under Glass. It would be such a pleasure to watch their heckling of this. I like Demon Under Glass but I love watching things I like get made fun of. It's better than some of the successful vampire films out there. It's the vampire equivalent of Plan 9 from Outer Space only with meaning and substance.",1261526400,,5389,4.37913741223671

I really liked how the movie was character driven; you really get a feel for each one.  Upon starting the film, I had minimal hopes, as less than half the collection were even watchable, but ended up being pleasantly surprised!  Two thumbs up!",1230940800,,580,4.364485981308412
