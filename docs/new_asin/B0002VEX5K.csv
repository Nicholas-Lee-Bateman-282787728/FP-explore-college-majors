2125603,5,B0002VEX5K,"A far better adaptation of the book(s) than the 2018 film. Though it suffers from the available CGI of the time in which it was made, the performances (especially of a very conflicted and realistic teen Meg) really work, here. 2018's version is eye-poppingly pretty, and focussed much more time on the Mrs. characters. This one gives us the kids' relationships more fully and spends more time on Camazotz, making both Charles Wallace's decisions ring truer.
Keep in mind it's essentially a TV movie, and not did have the $100+ budget, nor the known star-power of the 2018 adaptation.
Has Everwood's Ephraim as Calvin, and Alfre Woodard as Mrs. Whatsit. My kids (under 12) preferred this version.",1520985600,14,695,4.948717948717949

A friend of mine told me about the books and she thought there were only 3, and originally there were only 3, so a nice surprise there are 2 more.  We had talked about it when we saw the preview of the 2018 remake movie.  There is a Disney 2003 version which is very good and stuck to the book pretty well.  It's a classic good against evil with some religious undertones so a good read.  The author's flowing writing is easy and i finished the book in 1 sitting.  I plan to pick another couple of the Quintet and see how those are.",1519776000,2,580,4.088495575221239

I should have gotten a refund when I realized it wasn't the correct movie but I DID watch it and it was my mistake. Not a bad young people movie, in fact, so I just rate it on that rather than what I thought I was buying. I do think it's a four star movie though, not a full five star.",1514073600,,450,4.125

2125695,5,B0002VEX5K,this was my first book and it started my life as an avid reader; the movie brought to life all of the characters and special effects just as i had imagined; all except for 'IT'; being just a simple man with red eyes did not come close to my imagination of what 'IT' looked like; but overall i was very pleased with the film,1494547200,,323,4.0625

2125721,2,B0002VEX5K,"It was entertaining on a superficial level, but I felt that too many liberties were taken that stole from the richness of L'Engle's book. First, to stay true to the novel, the Murry children should have been portrayed as respectful and kind to one another. The movie showed them arguing and insulting one another and disobeying Mother with no regard. Second, Mother should have been portrayed as loving, yet strong and in control of her emotions in front of the children. She does not grow exasperated or become impatient with the children or the circumstances surrounding Father's absence in the novel. Third, and most importantly, the portrayal of the three Mrs W's (particularly Mrs Which), Camazotz, the Man with Red Eyes, and IT are so far from the novel itself that it is almost as if the creators of the movie did not even read the novel. Mrs Which, though stern in the novel, is portrayed as being against bringing the children on this journey, where in the novel she agrees that it MUST be the children. In the novel, it is the earth-like quality of Camazotz, infected with sterile, robotic sameness of control by IT, that makes it eerie. The special effects and portrayal of the planet were overkill if not completely wrong. I think lovers of the novel will be disappointed. If the viewer can detach himself from what he knows and loves about the novel, then the movie does have a superficially entertaining appeal. Viewers: read the novel first. It's one of the few books I have reread multiple times throughout my life, and I always gain new appreciation for and understanding from it. This movie nowhere near does it justice.",1479772800,21,1638,4.77112676056338

I'm not one of those people who thinks that the movie should necessarily follow the book completely, but this was so far off, it was almost a completely different story.  That might have been ok had the story in the movie been a good one, but it was a pale imitation of the original.

They took out so much of the good stuff about Meg's awkwardness, her close knit family, Calvin's coolness, the school principal, the value of love, that there wasn't much left except some really boring junk.

Mrs Which was too unlike the character description in the book. Too visible, too glamorous, too human. Mrs Who was too pretty and young. Alfre Woodard fit her part the best even though she was portrayed as Caucasian in the book. The Man with Red Eyes actor hammed it up too much to be believably menacing.

As always some of the detail in the book is missing but overall the feel and essence of the story has been maintained.  Meg pulls off a nuanced performance and her relationship with Calvin stays on the right side of teen romance.  I thought Charles Wallace's performance is astounding regardless of his age and even more so considering that he was only 8 at the time.

My 9 year old liked it while my 12 year old got hung up on the special effects and the anachronistic elements in the movie (wow what a difference 11 years makes in technological progress) and wasn't too impressed.",1416182400,,856,4.467948717948718

2125831,1,B0002VEX5K,"I think I should just stop watching films based on books I love.

Oh. My. God. What a travesty. This thing is absolutely abysmal, and I mean seriously worse than any fantasy adaptation I've seen thus far. I really love ""A Wrinkle in Time."" It's been one of my favorites since childhood. The book is beautiful and genuinely creepy. This movie does it no justice. I knew the budget was low and it wasn't a theatrical release, but I was expecting something more faithful to the source material.

My goodness, is this tripe awful! The computer graphics are terrible, the script fails on every level, the characters are nothing like their book counterparts, most people are woefully miscast with the possible exception of the Murry parents and Charles Wallace, the themes are butchered, speculative ideas are culled and the story is modernized into a mess of typical fantasy cliches. For example, Charles Wallace is some kind of chosen one and has to fight the Black Thing, while Meg and Calvin are just tagging along to keep him safe because he's so little.

The three witches act as if they couldn't care less about the kids and act superior, spewing garbage lines like, ""I pride myself on my knowledge. Meg, you have taught me a lot about the human race."" In the book they were intellectually and spiritually on the level of angels. They were never careless of the kids' affections and they exuded safety. In the movie they were wacky, cliche, and barely even present in the story.

So many botched details like this one completely missed the mark. Why was Calvin's role dumbed down to cheerless jock? Why was the cross-dressing, gender-bending happy medium a creep? And by this I don't mean that cross-dressers or people of indeterminate gender are creepy, because they are not. I mean that the happy medium laughed at things that weren't funny, like kids falling off of swings. S/he just came across as sadistic and creepy.

The man with red eyes is transformed into a Big Bad Villain who sneers and grimaces and laughs and wheedles in the cheesiest of ways. The guy in the book was quietly menacing and couldn't even move from his chair. Where the heck was the pulsing brain and why wasn't IT actually in the movie? This is the first movie I've watched wherein the main villain's name and identity do not add up. They kept referencing IT as if IT was in charge, yet the only villain we see the kids fight is the man with red eyes with his brainwashing electric ball.

Everything that was original and unique about the book is trivialized in this childish way. The disobedient boy of Camazotz didn't feel any pain when he had to bounce the ball, he just got brainwashed in one second. IT was a writhing mass of something that looked like giant gray worms coming up through the floor.

Other things just made no sense whatsoever.

The man with red eyes kicks Meg's father in his broken leg, and the first thing out of Meg's mouth is, ""Why are your eyes red?"" Jeez, Meg, you love your dad, you punch anyone who says he left your mother, and the man just got kicked in his broken leg. That's all you have to say?

The Murry parents' names are changed. Why? What for? The twins are heartless and mean to Meg and Charles Wallace.

Why was there a giant hallucinogenic book in the middle of Central Intelligence from which the man with red eyes could pull out random stuff to show Charles Wallace?

Why did Charles Wallace get the ability to telekinetically make Meg flip around in the air?

Why did the man with red eyes pull out cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, first woman in space, to talk to Charles Wallace?

Why didn't Tereshkova speak Russian?

Why did Tereshkova start flying around in the air as if she was doing aerial ballet? What the heck is wrong with this movie?

The sad part is, flying Tereshkova and all, this isn't the worst movie adaptation of a fantasy book I've ever seen, though it's a serious contender. Sci-fi Channel's ""Earthsea"" was.",1415750400,2,3953,4.627142857142857

2125855,4,B0002VEX5K,"On one level this is a traditional good verses evil story with a message for young viewers to believe in themselves etc. Three children (at least one of which is not average) set out on an adventure across dimensional barriers in search of the father of two of the children. They receive advice but little actual help form three strange women. The children carry the story line, which is not totally predictable.
The story is easy to follow and the special effects are fairly good. Do not expect an adult adventure film, this movie did not get the more sophisticated treatment which ""Harry Potter"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"" got, it is still geared to a younger audience. On the other hand it is well enough written and acted that most older audiences will not feel that their intelligence is being insulted.

This movie is based on an old novel, one that many of us read in school. While Disney tried to adapt it to the big screen, they failed miserably. This movie was way too long and confusing for kids. Even I had a hard time sitting through it. Katie Stuart gives a tremendous performance as Meg, but sadly it was the only note worthy performance. Gregory Smith, one of my favorite young actors, was quite bland, the three ladies were just ridiculously Disneyfied, and David Dorfman, while adorable, was very repetitive.

Reviews here (and I took the time to read them all) seem to follow this pattern: If you've read the landmark book, this movie is mediocre. If you've never read it, the movie, as a stand-alone flick, is good-to-great.

I bought the DVD for our grandkids but will try to get them to read the book. Why am I not rating it lower? At least a movie HAS been done, and it's OK, but NO SUBSTITUTE for taking the time to read, and enjoy your imagination.

I'm another boomer who had the book read to us, a chapter at a time in grade school. It was so exciting! The showdown with IT was the best part. In this movie, you don't even know what IT is!!!  Massive tentacles?? Where's that oversize pulsating brain!!! The red-eye guy is a poor substitute for the ""villain."" (He's only supposed to be a conduit.)

I don't hold out any hope that this book will ever be redone as another film, ever again. Too many kids bypassing the book, and comparing this movie to Star Wars, Potter, and other scifi/fantasies. By comparison it comes across as a B-movie.

Good points:  The cast did a good job. I like the boy that played Charles Wallace. The house looked much like I pictured it.  Who, Which and Whatsit were okay, although I pictured older women.

Bad points:  The special effects were downright pitiful.  I used to laugh at the special effects on some of the cable-made sci-fi movies.  But they look wonderful compared to this.  The movie just did not follow the book.  Things happened in different places, in different ways and just was a far cry from the book.

2125910,4,B0002VEX5K,"This is one of those stories that really does work for both children and adults. It is based on Madeleine L'Engle's marvelous book, which is supposedly for children, but is one of those to share.

The Murry family is -- to put it mildly -- rather unusual. Father Jack and mother Dana are both well-respected scientists. The oldest child, Meg, is the narrator of the story. It may take some time to get to know her special qualities, but even at the start we know she is smart. The twins Sandy and Dennys are a constant source of irritation, but really the only thing strange about them is their being twins. But the youngest, Charles Wallace, is amazingly smart, possibly with Asperger's Syndrome, and quite adorable.

When the story opens, Jack has been missing for a year, and nobody seems to know where he went or why. It turns out, however, that Charles Wallace's three magical friends, Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, know where he is, and are willing to help Meg and Charles Wallace (He's never just called ""Charles,"" but always ""Charles Wallace."") to go to him. Calvin O'Keefe, a teenage boy who may or may not be Meg's boyfriend, is brought along for the ride.

And what a ride! The visual effects are spectacular, but the only explanation for the mode of travel is the subject in the title: They travel across a wrinkle in time, or more precisely the space/time continuum, and arrive in an extraordinary place that is dominated by ""It"" in much the same way Orwell's 1984 was dominated by Big Brother.

Meg, Calvin and Charles Wallace are there to find and rescue Meg's father, but in the process Charles Wallace gets seduced by It. How his rescue is affected is a whole new ball game.

First Impressions:

The film was overly saccharine and though the ideas of honor, love and not giving up are valid and true values for living, the movie really hit it over your head with a brick!  Believe this or else we will tell you over, and over, and over, and etc.  Gosh!

Plot (Mild Spoilers):

The movie starts out with a missing dad and a grieving family that has a fading hope that Jack will return to them.  Meg though feels betrayed and deserted.  She has very low self-esteem and feels like she is a freak.  And her six year old brother Charles Wallace is so beat-up by those around him that he will speak to no one except family.

OK, so how does this dysfunctional, depressing family actually be chosen as a vanguard to save the Universe from the Darkness??  Well, let me tell ya!

The story moves forward to some magical beings who are imaginably old and wise, yet don't know the basic concepts of courage and confront.  This seems very unrealistic to me - and they even squabble amongst themselves if this is the right course of action - of the billions on Earth, why choose three kids?

They feel Charles Wallace is some kind of chosen one.  Unfortunately he gets entangled with the bad guys on another planet.  But this is all eventually fixed and Meg, spouting words of Love, somehow chases the Darkness away!

Bottom Line:

Some methods of disbelieve must be employed when watching a fantasy film but even here the film was way too saccharine sweet for my taste, with the message of the film being too overpowering to be effective - and the beings Whatsit, Whosit and Which, despite being immensely old, would really be this ineffective?  And Charles Wallace, all played up during most of the movie, would actually not be all that effective?

According to Wiki, even the author of the original novel didn't like it!

Even so, recommended only for the very young who may enjoy the film's special effects and colorful story.

Meg and her brother Charles Wallace are the odd children of the Murry family.  They're just a little too different and after the disappearance of their father, Meg becomes more than a little angry.  But things change when an odd woman shows up at their door and tells them both that they're needed.  Along with Calvin O'Keefe, a new friend, they are swept away to a different planet where they learn an evil being is keeping their father captive.  They have to try to save them without being taken under control by the Evil IT who is there.

Characters:
Katie Stuart: Meg Murry
Gregory Smith: Calvin O'Keefe
David Dorfman: Charles Wallace Murry
Chris Potter: Dr. Jack Murry
Kyle Secor: Man with Red Eyes
Sean Cullen: Happy Medium
Sarah Jane Redmond: Dana Murry
Kate Nelligan: Mrs. Which
Alison Elliott: Mrs. Who
Alfre Woodard: Mrs. Whatsit
Munro and Thomas Chambers: The Twins

I'm sure the actors tried their best but the vast majority were downright awful.  I don't know if it was the way they played the characters or just the way the script was written, but they greatly deviated from the characters in the book.  Mrs. Which especially wasn't very good and didn't seem the wise all-knowing being that she is in the book.  Mrs. Who too had some trouble in that regard as well.  In fact, of the three Mrs. W's, only Mrs. Whatsit seemed believable and likable to me, although she was a bit strange.  Charles Wallace was the greatest disappointment.  He was a little brat in this movie and was completely unlike his character in the book.  They made him less spectacular than he really is.  Meg and Calvin were ok and were the closest to their characters in the book, but even they weren't the beloved characters I grew up reading about.

The plot greatly deviates from the book as well with all sorts of random things happening.  While the basic premise is the same, it was definitely ""spiced up"" for the theatre and I think that it loses some of its charm because of this. I do have to say that I was kind of surprised that, for the year this movie was made, the graphics were rather terrible.  They were kind of blotchy for special effects and I think they could have made some of the more fantastical elements more realistic than they did.  The creature Mrs. Whatsit turns into, especially, could have been much improved on.  The music as well was pretty cheesy and didn't really fit with the movie as a whole.

Definitely not what I was expecting and rather a let down.  I think I'll stick to the books and avoid any sequels that come out for this movie.

2125920,1,B0002VEX5K,"L'Engle refused to allow this classic to be made into a movie for decades, fearing no one would do the book justice. She shouldn't have buckled and allowed Disney to do what they did to her book. Considering the resources Disney has at its fingertips, I can only guess that their failure with this movie is a result of spite. First of all, the movie is terribly boring. The characters are simpering, melodramatic, and not very deep. The special effects are overdone and rather cliche, which Disney seems to rely to avoid the depth of the story. Most insulting of all was the deliberate censorship of the book's spiritual themes. While Disney rarely stays true to books and traditional stories, they still usually manage to do an excellent job of entertaining the audience. In WIT, however, the movie is confusing, rushed, and dull for all its CGI effects. I really wish I could find the old 1974 filmstrip of the book which did a better job with far fewer resources than Disney has.
Jeff Stockwell has been hired to adapt the book for theaters, and maybe he can repair some of the damage this movie did.",1307923200,4,1103,4.63265306122449

2125922,2,B0002VEX5K,"While it has been ages since I read the wonderful book this film was based on (so I don't have as much awareness of the changes made to the story), there is one major issue I take with the DVD: it is released in fullscreen.

While watching the behind the scenes material, it is clear that this was filmed widescreen.  Heck, the deleted scenes in the extras are IN widescreen.  But how does Disney release the movie itself?  1.33:1.

That is an insult to the movie-buying public: to hack off over 1/3 of the visuals that were filmed prior to the public release.  Directors and cinematographers have reasons for including, or not including, certain things in the film frame.  Sometimes Pan and Scan results in so much being removed from a scene that one cannot understand what the character on-screen is doing.  At times, actions that are at both edges of the frame are essential for comprehending the story.  To tamper with all of that by chopping the film up shows no respect whatsoever for the source material.

If Disney doesn't respect the film or the viewer, I certainly will not be buying this DVD.  Nor do I recommend others buy this film.",1301529600,2,1145,4.5911330049261085

The Disney version of course has everything dark and stormy yada yada. And in the movie they save Camazots wtf!! In the book they could not kill IT because everyone else would die, in fact they don't even try. After saving Charles they leave and Camazotz stays forever doomed.

Anyway, watched the movie and loved it, so I read the book and thought it was totally awesome. Several years later, and after devouring Madeline L'Engle's other books, I found the movie again at the library and checked it out remembering how much I'd enjoyed it. Big mistake. I spent the movie cringing and being annoyed that the characters were 'doing it wrong'. Charles Wallace was the biggest disaster in my opinion. In the book he is a charming, yet highly intelligent little boy, he seems like any sweet kid. In the movie he comes off as an arrogent prick.

I watched it as soon as I got the DVD, but I was a bit disappointed.  Perhaps if I had not read the book, I would have thought the movie was better than it was, but that was not the case.  It was tragic to see what they had done to Mrs. Who, my favorite character of the novel.  In the novel she was constantly quoting people, and in various languages, but in the movie was an afterthought and just seemed odd.  The Happy Medium seemed like a characture of a homosexual male and not the ambiguous being that it was in the novel.  I felt that they could have done a great deal more with the over 2 hours they had in the movie.  I could list a million more things that they should have done better, but that would be pointless.  If you have not read the books and simply want a safe for families adventure story, then this is a good choice.

The book was, of course, much better, and that may be why I was slightly disappointed. The visual effects were kind of... well... they kind of sucked. The flying horse thing was ridiculous and I think it was the worst part of the film.

The Happy Medium was pretty bad too. I did like the three Mrs. W's, they did a surprisingly good job. Meg and Calivin did awesome as well. Charles Wallace, however, was kind of creepy at times and for the most part came off as a weird kid, even around his family. In the book, he seemed more cute and just quiet, not at all weird.

Instead of just skipping over some details like most movies based on books do, they also added things that didn't belong. I really wanted to see them make the stop on the 2-dimensonal planet, and was disappointed t osee that part missing.

The Tesseract could have been better, too. They explained it well in the movie, but I had imagined it a lot different. The way they showed it in the movie just looked like someone was on shrooms or drugs. The one where they were going through ""IT"" was kind of cool though.

Still, it was worth watching and I'd still recommend it, if at least for the sake of having a visual of the book.",1224028800,2,1338,4.2109375
2125934,3,B0002VEX5K,"Although the characterizations and effects are well done, I never quite felt totally drawn into the movie. The story centers around three kids going to another land to find the father of two. This land is beautiful with some unusual beasts. But what is most striking about the movie is the emphasis placed on emotions like love.

2125937,1,B0002VEX5K,"The ""Wrinkle in Time"" book series is my favorite series from childhood. I have read and re-read them more times than I can count over the last 35+ years. The characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are near and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual story that I love so much. To say I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement.

If you have never read the book(s) I imagine you will enjoy the movie. The acting is passable, the special effects are well done for a made for TV movie, and the story is interesting. However, if you love the books, avoid this movie at all costs.

I found this statement at the Wikipedia page of the novel: ""In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said of the film, 'I expected it to be bad, and it is.'""

I feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind.",1213228800,4,890,4.349397590361446

2125939,4,B0002VEX5K,"Young viewers will find a lot to like in this movie. Kids save the day (and their father) against overwhelming odds, but with help from some very odd characters. The kids, Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace, offer plenty for anyone who's ever felt outcast for being different from the others. That includes a big message about being yourself despite evrything.

The target audience appears to be the tweenagers for who L'Engle's books were originally intended, so adults might find parts unsophisticated. The darkened land of blind conformity reinforces L'Engle's message, though. Being yourself is important - look what happens when everyone tries to be everyone else. The anti-authority message won't work for all kinds of parents, but I think that, in moderation, it's a healthy habit of mind.

Effects really make this movie, even if the actual nature of a mathematical tesseract gets lost. That helps, because some of the plot elements and especially some of the acting lack in subtlety. The child actors did well, though, including a remarkable performance in portraying six year old Charles Wallace.

I read L'Engle's books, but that was when this 1963 book was relatively new so I've mostly forgotten them. For better or worse, this review addresses the WiT movie by itself, without regard to L'Engle's classic. Any book so beloved inevitably disappoints some who love it most - it can never live up to the world that such a reader has already imagined. I understand that frustration, but lots of us don't have the book fresh in our minds. Try to take it for what it is, not for what it's not. It might not suit the youngest kids, but kids of the right age will like it a lot.

She retained creative control and the film company wouldn't budge, so she let that option lapse.

Fortunately, this version is faithful to the book, although some detail changes are made to make the story easier for kids to identify with (for example, Mom drives a minivan).  The acting is uniformly good and I really enjoy the wonderous feel of the score.  It was interesting to see how the filmmaker's conception of Mre.

2125945,3,B0002VEX5K,"With all the books that have recently been made into fantastic movies (Harry Potter; The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; The Lord of the Rings...), I was very disappointed that Disney did not give this movie the budget and attention it deserved.

There were plenty of minor changes from the book.  The parents names have changed.  There's some focus on Charles Wallace not liking pineapple, that didn't appear in the book.  Meg is a bit of a tomboy.  It's set in modern times, so you see the internet being used.  All these things are forgivable; a movie interpretation will never be exactly the same as a book.  However, this movie seemed to lose much of the essense of the story being told.

I thought the three children did an okay job for the roles they were given.  That said, they weren't given much to work with.  None of the characters are developed; I don't think the audience would feel attached to any of them, if they didn't already know them from the books.

The interpretation of the three ladies was different from the book, although not altogether bad.  I enjoyed Mrs. Who's character the most.  In the book, Mrs. Which was stern but encouraging; in the movie, she begins by casting the children aside.  Her character became more supportive as the movie continued, at least.  Mrs. Whatsit was a bit sillier than I had imagined her, and the Happy Medium was very silly and not appealing to me.  For me, the silliness detracted from the intensity of the story.

The special effects were pretty terrible--and this from Disney?  The tessering scenes were okay--I'm not really sure how one would visualize tessering, anyhow--but they lasted several minutes longer than they needed to.  Weak special effects just shouldn't be dragged out.  Mrs. Whatsit's horse-like creature was laughable.  And the purpose of the big brain in the final scenes just wasn't clear.  In the book, there is a large brain that is understood to be the center of control of Camazotz.  In the movie, you really only see the man with the red eyes, with no explanation that there is a power greater than he at work, so the giant brain coming out at the end just seemed strange.  And the cuts between scenes were a bit annoying, too.  This was originally made for TV, so some of the scene transitions were meant to incorporate a commerical break.  However, the attempt at creating suspense during some of these transitions came off as overdone and silly.

Finally, the music was mediocre, and at times distracting.  During ""suspenseful"" scenes, I found myself hearing the music and thinking about how cheesy it was.  Think about the fantastic movies you've seen, and the wonderful scores associated with them.  This score was not one of those.

Die-hard fans who want to own everything Wrinkle will want to own this movie as well.  It's not terrible.  However, it's not wonderful, either.  It's fairly harmless, so some children may enjoy it, if they can make sense of it, with so much of the theme being glossed over.  You should definitely make sure you introduce the children to the book, as well, to cover what the movie didn't.",1173052800,4,3117,4.730483271375465

2125947,1,B0002VEX5K,"I can't believe BLT productions had anything to do with this film which is unwatchably bad. Now I see why Roy Disney made a website called Save Disney. Oddly enough, Disney did a great job on a lesser-known L'Engle book, Ring of Endless Light, which will hopefully make it out on DVD.

Who doesn't think L'Engle's time quintet (there are five books, even if it's sold as a quartet: An Acceptable Time is the fifth) deserves Harry Potter treatment? Who doesn't think these books would be great on the big screen? Supposedly, properties float around the various studios in Hollywood until someone picks them up. Look at the really bad books that get made into films. Here's one of the best properties you could find, just lying dormant.

Here's an idea; let's save Disney and (re)make it as Walt intended: a company with drive and passion, heart and soul that cares what it puts out and doesn't pass off schlock like Desperate Housewives through its ABC network or the endless man-hating shows on Deathtime. How could anyone be proud of making shows like that? What a waste of talent and money!

I've been curious for a long time about it, so I bought it and watched it with my family. Instead of my husband and I taking our kids to the movies, we bought this hoping it would be good.

I was curious about what other members thought of this film and after watching the movie I'm saddened to see that those who put it down and called it awful missed the points. It's not about crystal balls or witchcraft, though don't even get me started because The Wizard of Oz is a beloved classic and has those same features!! This story had a heart. It was about acceptance of one's self, about not assuming things about others, about love for your family, about judgement, about believing children come into this world with gifts we as grown ups take for granted.

I saw my kids in this movie. I grew a little more as a person watching it.

I am perhaps someone who is different from others. When I go to see a movie, I don't just go and see if for entertainment. I see it hoping to learn something new about myself. Life is full of lessons and I try not to miss them.

I am saddened by those parents that said they'd never let their kids see this movie. It means as a society we have not become any more open minded. If you want to say the movie is not as good as the book I can accept that. But for it's content, nah. I thought it was beautiful. Best of all, so did my kids.",1141516800,35,1484,4.054607508532423

2125956,3,B0002VEX5K,"It's a funny contradiction, watching movies based on books you loved as a kid. On the one hand, I'm always fascinated - sometimes, morbidly so - to see how the story's been adapted, what's been changed, and how it's otherwise been adapted for the visual experience. On the other hand, I always know that even the best of adaptations is probably going to leave me feeling a little bit flat. A fine example of this is Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" a film I certainly enjoy on its own merits, but don't consider a particularly nice adaptation of the book. And ""Alice"" is a simple book - at least, when compared to ""A Wrinkle in Time."" How many other kids' books hinge on particle physics?

Flash-forward forty-one years from its original publication, and Disney has finally prepared a TV miniseries of the much-loved classic. Hit the forward button a couple more, and I'm watching it on DVD with a rather significant amount of trepidation.

The verdict? It's not too bad. Not out-and-out fantastic, but not too bad.

The interesting thing is that they seem to have tried, as much as possible, to respect the book. The plot is not particularly different, and sometimes that's an outright flaw - there are sections toward the end where you simply won't understand everything that's happening unless you've read the book. On the other hand, though, Disney apparently cut it from a two-part miniseries to a two-hour movie, and only restored part of that material for the DVD release (which runs 128 minutes - a miniseries, surely, would've been around 180 or 200, allowing for commercials). It's possible, even likely, that some such explanations were lost in the editing room. But more on this later.

Aside from the limits of the length, however, the script is remarkably keen at keeping what needs to be kept and ditching the rest. Sadly, that's very much undone by a bombardment of truly poor CGI effects. The children land on an alien planet? The planet, the dust, even the buildings are CGI. One character magically transforms into a centaur? The centaur is completely, and obviously, cheap CGI. Someone needs to run down a series of linked corridors? CGI, CGI, CGI. I played more realistic video games in the late '90s. All of the money seems to have gone toward the actual ""tesseract"" effect, which while important, did not need to be so grandiose, especially at the expense of all else. I mean, for cryin' out loud, when there's an overhead shot of trees, the trees should look -real.-

And the special effects are my main beef with the TV movie, because in most other respects, it's at least acceptably successful. The three child/teen leads are all quite well cast, even David Dorfman as Charles Wallace, who is required to play the most precocious 6-year-old ever. Most of the adults do quite well, too, with the exception of Alfre Woodard, who is simply channeling overcooked ham. It's hard to play alien eccentrics, after all - and it's only at the very end that she finally realizes she doesn't need to emphasize every other word that comes out of her purple lips. Perhaps she took a hint from Sean Cullen as the Happy Medium, who utterly ruins his one scene. Fake laughter is not actually funny, nor is it endearing. Alison Elliott's rather dotty Mrs Who actually grew on me, though, as did Kate Nelligan's somewhat overly-sympathetic (even overly-corporeal!) Mrs Which. They're not quite what I read in the book at age seven, but they're not light years away, either.

You may get the impression from these paragraphs that I'm not sure whether I liked the film or not. That's essentially true. It's not as bad as I feared, but it's still kids'-TV-movie territory, and it can be a little hard to take at times. I think I fall just barely on the side of liking it, though. I checked it out for free at the library, after all, and I had a fair idea of what I was getting into. I'm just happy the core of the story, bad CGI or otherwise, is very much intact.

The DVD actually has a couple of nice features. The first is a series of five deleted scenes, almost all of which take the story much, much farther away from the source novel than anything in the finished film, by rather needlessly giving background to several characters and the Tesseract project. One is a particularly noxious ""training"" sequence where the three ladies try to get the children to understand their weaknesses, making room for some completely unnecessary references to Harry Potter and Star Trek. Together, these deleted scenes are almost twenty minutes long, and they left me wondering if I'd really like that original cut after all. (Maybe not!) More pleasant is a 10-minute interview with the original author, Madeline L'Engle, who very succinctly describes why she wrote the book and the message she was trying to get across. If you bother to watch the film, you should definitely check her out.

So, do I recommend this? Reservedly. I've seen much poorer adaptations in my time, and I'd sooner watch it again than a fair few shinier, more expensive ones that make travesties of their source novels. If you've read and enjoyed ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" and are ready for a few small differences, a rental or a library loan of this DVD should fill an evening pleasantly enough.",1127347200,10,5260,4.740983606557377

2125958,2,B0002VEX5K,"Crap, crap, crap, it's all crap!

Aside from the fact that is sucked the whole way through, this movie stinks!

 I am a huge fan of the book, and I have read it many times over. So when I found this in video form I was thrilled. My sister exactly told me that it was pretty good, I must mention here that she hasn't read the book in over five years.

 I had high hopes when the movie began with a cool scene with the star giving its life for the war against Black Thing. And that's a good place to start, the Black Thing was more often then not, a purple thing or a blurring thing. There was nothing very scary about the ""thing."" In the book it creeped you out totally, in the movie you're like, ""What? What was that? Why is it evil?""

 The second thing that really bothered me was the group of boys that attacked Charles Wallace and Meg were smaller then she was? In the book, they were bigger and heavier then she was. There was no bickering and name calling between the siblings, there was a strong sense of loyalty and love.

 Charles Wallace was okay, but I tended to like him better as the creepy evil child he was with it. I know that sounds bad, but you have to consider that instead of being the sweet child he was in the book, he was scornful and nasty as all the others. Blah.

 In the book, Calvin is just as important to the plotline as Meg and Charles Wallace. However they buttered his part as well, they merely made him a jock. He did nothing in the movie but make some funny comments. They took a noble and interesting character and made him into a blah cardboard cutout like all the other actors.

 Meg, in the movie, was a sulky self centered brat that I hated throughout the movie. All she cared about was herself and her problems. This is one of the times that I wish that, when the character complains about how much they hate themselves, their friends would say, ""I hate you too."" At the end when she should be delivering the lines, ""I love you Charles Wallace! You are the light of my life, and the treasure of my heart! I love you, my baby brother who always cares for me, I love you!""

 She's half heartedly says, ""I love you and I want to always be there for you."" All I can say is lame, lame, lame! Blah!

 Central, central intelligence is a joke and we all know it. I like good CGI, but this stuff was laughable! You could plainly see all the fake stuff, it was like they sat down and said, ""Let's see just how badly we can butcher this movie and still get people to watch it!""

 Mrs. Whatsit was okay, but when she transformed into the creature and turned out to be a horse with a human head and peacock feathers? I nearly died from laughing and crying hysterically. I mean, did they honestly look at that thing and say, ""Yeah, looks like the majestic creature described in the book.""

 Mrs. Who was the best and most faithful of all the ladies, to the book. She was quoting left and right and had a sweet endearing look about her. However I have major problems with her quoting Albus Dumlbedore like he was a real person. I am not a fan of Harry Potter and never will be and I find her quoting him beside someone like Gothre to be repulsive.

 Mrs. Which was a fabrication from beginning to end. In the book she rarely appeared and when she did it was in the grab of a traditional witch, for the laughs. But she was stern and loveable at the same time. However this woman was choking in a hideous golden gown and spurting hooky clichs left and right. I hated her.

 I also found the Happy Medium to be very stupid, a sweet slightly ridiculous figure in the book, this was a fat man in a turban laughing at other peoples problems! Oh, I forgot to mention the fact that He/She claims to be neither man or woman therefore making gender meaningless. I wish they had killed him off.

 In the reading of ""A Wrinkle in Time"" there is a heavy spiritual sense about it. Biblical figures are mentioned as warrior in the fight against the darkness, not artist and humanists. The bible is quoted in the singing of the beast on Uriel and not just something vague about, ""Joy.""

 Why is it that whenever Hollywood takes a strongly christen story that they turn it into something humanist about believing in our own human powers? I think everyone should have a health amount of self confidence, but not to the sappy and dangerous level they pump it out in this film. They very thing they were saying you should have is what made Charles Wallace fall into the trap of it, in the first place.

 The man with red eyes was not supposed to speak outwardly but mentally. He was silently menacing. In this film he was overly emotional and silly, albeit, he did have some killer lines. But they combined his character and that of IT. Instead of the pulsing brain on a dais they had a huge pulsing CGI...thing. It meant nothing to us and all my family thought it was a bunch of worms.

 Nowhere is the awesome scene where they reject it using nursery rhymes, or the quoting of the Declaration of Independence. This was a powerful scene they cut completely, and they make the beasts on Ixchel big furry wookie like creatures out of the Twilight zone. Stupid!

The rest of the characters were very flat and I felt no connection to any of them.

2125963,1,B0002VEX5K,"If Star Wars and The Neverending Story had a garage sale and Disney was the first one to arrive for the good prices, that would only half explain the problem with this film.  I have never seen more disrespect for a book than I did with Disney's release of A Wrinkle in Time.  From the horrible, cheap-ish acting to the video game styled CGI, there was nothing in this film that appealed to me or would for anyone that was a fan of L'Engle's work.  There were moments when I swore that I was watching a poorly made After-School special about the loss of a family member, but reality caught hold and I was forced back into A Wrinkle in Time.

Where to begin ... well, how about the acting?  Did they pull these child stars out of the dollar bin, or are they generally this horrible? Katie Stuart (Meg) seemed like she didn't even care about being in the film.  There was no emotion behind any of her character's lines leading us down a path of apathy towards any big moments in this film.  She was our leader, she was the one that was supposed to bring us up in arms about the events that were happening, instead she just spoke the lines given to her and stepped where she was supposed to.  No originality, no excitement, no enjoyment could be seen behind Stuart's eyes and ultimately it hurt this film.  Well, it was one of the bigger elements that hurt this film. Gregory Smith needs to stay on the WB for a bit longer because it is his best work to date.  I am a fan of Everwood and I don't understand how he could be so good in that, yet horrible in this.  It was as if he was simply looking for the paycheck to buy that new car he can finally drive.  It was ... for lack of a better word ... pathetic. I was also a bit disappointed with the choice of the kid from The Ring as Charles Wallace. He couldn't embody the character at all, and it became obvious that the only reason he was involved with this film was because he was in a blockbuster film.  He was not Charles Wallace, just an actor trying to get paid.  The same can be said for everyone else in the film that really didn't put any emotion or emphasis on their characters.  The motions were done, but it just felt that nobody cared.  For those that have read the book, the characters will probably be a big hurdle to overcome.  The parents of these children looked like they had Meg at the ripe age of 16.  They truly did not embody the vision that L'Engle gave us in the written word.

How about that cheap CGI?  Disney forte, so to speak, is animation.  It is what they built their foundation on, so why was this CGI so horribly bad?  I couldn't tell if I was playing a video game or watching a film half of the time.  When the children arrive to the planet engrossed with darkness, I couldn't help but laugh.  Nothing seemed real, nobody cared, and the film was quickly going down the toilet.  I was literally rolling around on the ground when Alfre Woodard transformed into the horsy creature.  It was visually horrible to look at and made me happy that my imagination could create a better representation in my mind when I read the book.  Also, what were the Wookies doing on the planet that somewhat resembled Hoth?  Frustration was just boiling out of me by this time.  I felt cheated and hurt all at the same time.

The story didn't help my frustration either.  I felt I had walked into my local butcher shop and watched director John Kent Harrison go at it with a butcher's knife.  He showed no sympathy to the original story by L'Engle and, to be honest, didn't even seem to care.  Why do films like this get made in Hollywood?  It only hurts the story because if I had seen this film first, I would not have wanted to go back and read the book.  L'Engle should not have allowed this travesty to occur, but as everyone showed in this film, sometimes you gotta get paid.

Normally, I would go further into why I disliked this film, but I am just so angry that there is no point.  This was the worst film that I have seen this year and do not suggest it for anyone that enjoyed the written work of L'Engle.  She was creative, original, and developed some amazing imagery for young adults to grow into.  I wish I could say the same about this film, but (as you can see) I cannot.  There was nothing redeemable in this film at all.  Not even the ending credits were any good.  No money was spent on them.  I still cannot grasp the understanding on how a multi-billion dollar company like Disney can create films like this without giving it the proper budget.  It was a disgrace and I shan't see it again!

 It's 2004, Disney... there is NO reason to release a DVD in Pan and Scam only.

It really is a shame, because the film was MUCH better when shown on Satellite in 16x9.",1105142400,5,227,4.0
2125965,3,B0002VEX5K,"I saw this film with deep apprehension, having heard very ominous rumors.  I came out thinking, well, that wasn't very bad, but it wasn't very good, either, was it?

The three young actors are excellent, particularly Meg.  The three ladies are not at all faithful to L'Engle's conception, but on the whole entertaining (especially Woodard) and dramatically effective (especially Nelligan).  The other adults are, frankly, boring, except the Happy Medium, who's unwatchable.  Nice smirky presence from the Man with Red Eyes, though.

Judging from the deleted scenes included on the DVD, the editing process that shortened the film by a full hour actually improved the screenplay.  By cutting the earlier sequences focusing on Dr. Murray's experiments, the film was brought much closer to L'Engle's original plot structure and effectively restricts its point of view to that of the child protagonists.  While largely well staged and shot, the extraneous material is mostly unnecessary filler (and removing the already-dated ""Star Trek"" and ""The Matrix"" references was a wise move).

The effects are disappointingly low-budget; much of what we see even on TV is better produced than this, let alone on the big screen.  The production design of Camazotz is creepy, but doesn't even attempt to convey the deliberate, oppressive banality of L'Engle's description.  Aunt Beast and her race are, well, embarassing, as is the flying centaur.  The music is pretty, but unmemorable.

Until a really top-notch production of this book emerges, this will have to do.  I'm not holding my breath, though.  It would take a screenwriter and a director of absolute genius to distill L'Engle's tricky blend of coming-of-age drama, science fiction and cosmic philosophy into a play that doesn't condescend to either its audience or its content.  Harrison's version is earnest, but teeters perilously close to committing both errors.

And that flying centaur really is embarassing.",1104796800,9,1959,5.349673202614379
2125966,2,B0002VEX5K,"Warning: This is a frank, honest review of the movie, and it's only my opinion, but I've seen the movie twice and have read the book many times, and therefore I believe myself qualified to give it.

After receiving 'A Wrinkle in Time' as a Christmas present, I eagerly popped it in my DVD player, ready for the ride of my life.  The book, by Madeleine L'Engle, is one of my favourites, and I was interested to see how Disney made the movie.

While some scenes reach a very high level of entertainment, for a Disney B-movie, and you can tell that a lot of thought was put into many of the characters, the movie, in my opinion, fails to reach the heights that L'Engle intended and achieved with the book.  It's hard to tell what Disney's target audience is supposed to be -- while trying to attain the intellectual, thought-provoking storyline of the book, the movie attempts to appeal to both infantile and teenage audiences.

David Dorfman as Charles Wallace is not a miscast, but he definitely misinterprets the character development of CW.  Indeed he doesn't do much throughout the whole movie, except look like the loser everyone tries to make him out as being.  Katie Stuart makes for a far too boring Meg, and I felt no real reason to cheer her on when she tries to win her brother back from The Man with Red Eyes.  Gregory Smith is a handsome Calvin O'Keefe, and does give the movie a hot dynamic that it lacks with Meg and her boring family alone, but after the second viewing, it becomes apparent that his voice never changes at all in the movie.  His declarations, exclamations and questions all sound the same to me.  Meg's twin brothers are miscasts: they are the different, ""common"" boys that L'Engle makes them out as being, but Disney makes them too young and immature to matter at all.

The witches, however, work together to save the movie from being a total bore, even if they are further examples of the movie straying too far from the book.  A black Mrs. Whatsit?  A little out there, but it works!  Kate Nelligan as Mrs. Which is also a great choice.  Aunt Beast is also well done.  The Happy Medium is not at all how I imagined him -- he's supposed to be neither a man nor a woman, but just looks like a very feminine man -- but his character is not entirely a flop.  The Man with Red Eyes is, however, totally unconvincing.

The first half of the movie, in which Meg and her family, and Calvin are introduced, is a bit of a snooze.  I'm not convinced that Meg is anything but ordinary, even though everyone's constantly saying that she's different.  It's almost as if the movie is trying to give hope to mediocre girls that they might appeal to guys like Gregory Smith.  (I know, that's a very, very mean thing to say, but probably true.)  If you've read the book, you can easily fast forward to the second half.  Camazotz isn't at all like the Camazotz in the book.  Instead of being an almost complete mirror of Earth, the people are even more spaced out than in the book and the atmosphere is red. (?)  The ending is decent (spoiler here), but Disney does not employ the L'Engle technique of the witches leaving without saying where they're going or if they'll ever come back.  Boo!

I give this movie two stars because Disney tries, and Gregory Smith and the witches kept me watching.  Some scenes, such as the phony Meg's family scene that is shown to her on Camazotz, were well done and should be praised.  All in all, however, don't get your hopes up.  It's a rental.  Do, however, buy the book.",1104796800,10,3524,4.459375
2125967,3,B0002VEX5K,"I wanted to see a film version of A Wrinkle in Time so badly that I was rooting for this film all the way.  However, it must be difficult to capture a book of this imagination if you do not have a big budget like the Harry Potter films or do not have a script that matches the book.  The acting by the children are fine, but not stellar, and the beloved characters Mrs. Whatsit & Company were too bumbling and comical for the story.  Perhaps a darker, less comical version would have been better.",1104192000,10,496,4.2
2125968,3,B0002VEX5K,"Before there was Harry Potter and Lemony Snickett, there was Meg, Calvin, and little Charles Wallace.  ""A Wrinkle In Time"" was the beginning of one of the best fantasies for older children and, yes, even adults.  This film based on the first book in the fantasy is okay, but I feel as if the entire series was cheated when compared to such juggernauts as Potter and Lemony. I enjoy the Potter films and books as much as anyone, but I think that more attention should have been paid to ""A Wrinkle In Time.""  Not only was it the first ""big"" book that I ever read, it was also the first fantasy that I had ever read.  I fell in love with it immediately and it encouraged me to read even more books.  A couple of years ago, at the age of twenty-six, I read ""Wrinkle"" again, because I loved it so much.

Alfre Woodard is great as Ms. Whatsit, and Who and Which are also excellent.  The little boy chosen to play Charles Wallace was fantastic, he looked really creepy when It took over him.  The rest of the cast is superb as well, but that isn't where my complaint lies.

My complaint is with the production.  When the children travel throught the tesseract, fly on Ms. Whatsit, meet the Happy Medium, etc., the production looks like something off of Sci-Fi channel.  Also, something is lost in the translation to the screen, and the story comes off slow, plodding, and uninteresting at times.  Money is always an issue with films of this sort, but you'd think that Disney would have plunked down a little more dough on this picture.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case.  Instead, the actors are forced to drudge along through the story in an attempt to make the best of what they've been given.

Hopefully someone will come along and give this brilliant story the proper treatment it deserves.  It triggered the imaginations of many generations, and it should be given the same care and respect as Potter, Snickett, and all of the others that I'm sure will come along.

Three stars go to the actors in this film.  They do a brilliant job given the fact that they had so little to work with. I recommend this one with reservations.  It's fun to finally see some great childhood heroes on the screen, but I just wish they would have been treated better.  Read the book first, then watch this movie.",1102896000,27,2292,4.490338164251208
2125969,1,B0002VEX5K,"Full Disclosure on my Biases:

1) I have disliked the Walt Disney Company ever since they dared to release Hunchback of Notre Dame with a singing main character and a happy ending.

2) I would have been disappointed with anything less than a ""page one: film that. Page two: film that...Page 212: film that, roll credits"" adaptation.

Accepting those two biases in myself, I tried to keep an open mind as the film began. For the first three chapters, the movie was not totally unrecognizable from the book. The actors and actresses shown could have been Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin. Of course the scenes had to be updated for 2001 (when the movie was actually filmed: references to the Internet, CDs, etc.), and certain scenes were borrowed from the first chapter of A Wind in the Door (Charles is in first grade, age 6, not 5 as in the books.) After the first half hour I thought ""maybe I was wrong, they might be....""

Then the filmaker takes us off-world (Chapter 4). Major changes start appearing. Characters and sequences begin to be condensed or deleted entirely. Mrs. Which does not carry a broom not does her voice reverberate throughout the area. I'm thinking ""ok, there are budgets to consider. It's still ok.""

Then we get Meg and Co. to Camazotz (Ch. 6 and thereafter). The plot is suddenly ripped off its axis and sent spinning end over end into Disneyification. The plot is changed radically and what scenes do exist from the book are seen out of order.

The acting itself was decent. The special effects were bad, and incidental music was completely inappropriate in some places. The producer, who still claimed pride in this film's lack-of-quality, told a National Public Radio interviewer ""It's like a A Wrinkle in Time. If you loved every word on every page of the original, I hope you can understand the differences between the two mediums and appriciate both.""

To summerize my thoughts on this mistake of a production: If you loved the book: you will hate this movie. If you read the book, you won't recognize most of this movie. If you haven't read the book and see this first, you might enojy it, but then go read the book and realize how good the film could have been.",1102809600,17,2195,4.656330749354005
2125990,1,B0002VEX5K,"We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books. While not particularly accurate adaptations, these movies were nonetheless excellent films. Some great examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney film ever made. However, I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies. Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine L'Engle's fan base, it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience. Mind you, I'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary, I went into this affair with an open mind. I figured that a made-for-T.V. movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script. After all, the Star wars spin-off Ewoks was decent, if a little silly. Come to think of it, the original Star Wars was made on ""a lunch money budget"", and look where it took George Lucas! However, from the first scene onward, disappointment started enveloping me as if I'd gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering.

The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 (a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic), Mrs. Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time. The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief. Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our favorite star-turned-mentor, the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow. That's right, a crow.  Moreover, the heavenly centurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old; the majestic half-man, half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle. Had I been five, this would have psychologically traumatized me for life. The worst part is the fact that when it spoke, it was shone from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync, resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single, unmoving cheek, thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T.

Having gotten the most painful part out of the way, I must go on to the tear-inducing one: the characters, the acting, and the story. I, personally, had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films: plain hair, glasses, and a figure most supermodels would find laughable. She was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua. In the film, she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever. In fact, she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins, her school principal, who continuously has to deal with her. Calvin, the kind, intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has become...a jock! The irony is horrible. As for the memorable Happy Medium, the took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is ""above gender"" who likes to look at ""funny"" things, such as girls falling off of swings. The only two people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace and the Man With Red Eyes (nicknamed ""the Dude With Red Eyes"" due to his complete reinvention as a character).

The story is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book, yet kept the sole of the original work. Here, the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld, apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed. As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen, the flat-nosed wookies of Ixchel (who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks) tear the spine up. As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth-like Camazotz was, the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil.

I am very sorry that this film exists. I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad. It's the way they are written that ruins it. A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic, scored by John Williams, given its sound at Skywalker Sound, edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox. In its current state, the film is unworthy to be shown to self respecting people. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad.

I sat in my home and watched it with hopeful eyes, and all but cried during the entire movie for the sheer tragedy of it all.

I believe Madeleine L'Engle, in a Newsweek article dated May 7, 2004, sums up the movie in the best way possible:

2125995,4,B0002VEX5K,"I had great fear when I heard that Disney was planning on making a TV Miniseries out of the classic ""A Wrinkle In Time,"" because I knew just how awful most Disney TV movies are, and just how many liberties they would try to take for the sake of a TV audience. When ABC continued to postpone the airing of ""Wrinkle"" for almost two full years, I had even greater fear, because, more often than not, the reason for a very long delay in release is because the product is nigh-to-worthless. When I heard that the original 4-hour Miniseries plan was cut down to a 3-hour movie, that fear doubled. And then, ABC announced it would air beginning at 8pm, when most kids wouldn't be able to stay awake for the whole thing. All of this didn't bode well, and gave me the feeling that ABC didn't want anyone to see this movie.

After all is said-and-done, ""A Wrinkle In Time"" greatly exceeded my expectations. Sure, liberties were taken, but the majority of the items that were changed for the film were changed in a logical fashion, and would only be cited by die-hard L'Engleites.

THE GOOD:

- The casting. They didn't go for the pre-fabricated Hollywood ideal. Meg is pretty, but not a stunning supermodel with huge ""assets."" Calvin is kinda weird-looking. Charles-Wallace is a cute kid, but gives off an unexpected creepiness. And, despite my initial reservations, Alfre Woodard didn't annoy me at all.

- The acting. Top notch performances from all. Meg and Calvin had all of the chemistry and depth that the book demanded. Charles-Wallace, while occasionally slipping into cheese-mode, gave one of the creepiest performances I've seen since the original ""Bad Seed.""

- The set design. Specifically, the Murray house, and the planet Camazotz. Both were exactly what I had pictured when reading the book, and in my own screenplay adaptation attempts. The long streets lined with precise, grey tract housing was especially dead-on to my own vision.

- The cinematography. Jon Joffin, you deserve a cigar. Finally, a TV movie that isn't completely flat! There's shadow, depth, and mood dripping off of nearly every scene in this film. But, what more do you expect from the man who lit ""Home,"" by far one of the creepiest and darkest episodes of ""The X-Files."" Kudos specifically to Meg's arrival on Camazotz, lit only by a slight backlight and lightning flashes. Fantastic work.

- The score. Great work by Jeff Danna, who also wrote the moody, diverse score for ""Boondock Saints."" (His brother is Mychael Danna, of ""The Ice Storm"" and ""The Sweet Hereafter."") Of course, I do feel there were missteps, particularly the occasionally cartoony incidentals, but on the themes and backgrounds had a mood and depth that echoed the feelings exemplified in the book.

- The teleplay. Susan Shilliday certainly did change quite a few things, but the most important aspect remained, and that is the spirit of the book. The film displays the same sense of wonder and purpose that L'Engle infused into her novel. That, coupled with some well-placed snarky humor, made this adaptation one of the better ones I've seen.

- The very end. Call me whatever you want, but, I never cared for the end of the book. Sure it's creepy, but it's ridiculously sudden. The movie wrapped things up nicely while still providing a necessary bridge toward the book's sequels.

THE BAD:

- The Happy Medium. Egad, what a horrible decision that was. Please, next time, make sure characters are laughing at things that are actually funny.

- The visual effects. Granted, it's a TV budget. And granted, the effects are probably over a year old now. But still, it could've been much better. The winged horse was laughable, the landscapes were plastic, and ""IT"" was... well, not very much at all, was it? I did like the Tesseract effects, though I think that the film dwelled on too many of them. The final Tesseract effect was fantastic, and obviously the one that the most money was spent on. If more effects looked like that, I'd be happier.

- ""IT."" This was one change that really bothered me. Those of us who read the book know exactly what ""IT"" is, and showing such obscure sections of ""IT,"" and having the climactic battle with IT's representative rather than IT itself, I feel, was a poor choice.

THE UGLY:

- The direction. Sometimes, the film was very well-done. At other times, the direction was very clumsy and confusing. This could be attributed to how much had to be cut out of the 4-hour version to fit into its 3-hour timeslot, but nonetheless, there were some scenes that just didn't work at all.

All-in-all, ""A Wrinkle In Time"" is a very enjoyable film, and, despite a few wrong turns, is a good adaptation of a great work of literature.

As an aside, Amazon does list the wrong running time for this item. According to Disney's official site for the DVD, the running time is 128 Minutes.",1098576000,219,4862,4.748517200474496
2125996,4,B0002VEX5K,"I agree with just about everything that ""m. Salidas"" wrote- I am a HUGE fan of the original book, but I realized that the film would need to update certain aspects of it and it did not dissapoint me (if the original mini-series from which this was edited had aired, however, I might have been dissapointed based on what I've read of it- the Prime Cordinator (man with red eyes) was Dr. Murry's lab partner? Come on.)

In any case, my issue is with the Cover Art! I saw this a few weeks ago on another site and simply assumed this was just preliminary. Certainly this cover art which has nothing (except the three actors being the same) to do with the book or movie couldn't POSSIBLY be the cover art. But as it's showing up on Amazon, I become afraid that it is. What the heck?! I mean, the kids are riding a PEGASUS! Not a ""centaur-like creature"" as both the book and the movie presented, but a PEGASUS! And they're flying over . . . . a castle?! Um- WHAT?! Maybe I read a different book or saw a different movie, but there were no CASTLES anywhere I could see! This cover art quite simply does not accurately reflect the film!

(...)
someone that likes pegasus and puts them in his promotional art just for kicks and studio bosses that approve the work don't even care- they just approve it. I mean what, did this guy (or girl) watch the movie on fast-forward, fall asleep and have a dream about castles, vaguely remember some kind of flying creature and THEN make the cover art? Absolutely stupid. Had I not seen the movie (and with ABC's minimal advertising, few did), and saw this cover art with having a love of the book so much, I would assume that FAR more changes were made from the original movie and simply avoid it at all costs. As stated, the movie itself was good. Don't judge a movie by it's cover.

When the movie first aired on ABC I recorded it onto DVD and since I am a graphic artist by trade, I created cover art for my disk. If this IS in fact the final cover art (and I'm still hoping against hope that it isn't), I'll just throw it away and use my own cover art.

2125998,4,B0002VEX5K,"Flawed, but far from awful (which is what many readers of the beloved novel feared), this adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's 1962 `A Wrinkle in Time' is highly compelling.  I suspect this may have been a labor of love for director John Kent Harrison.

This film still retains much of the books sense of wonder and philosophy.  The characters, plot and milestones are all still here, and as a blueprint the movie follows the book faithfully.  Even some of the books famous lines ""Wild nights are my glory"", ""By the way there is such a thing as a teserract"", and ""We are here"" remain.  Many scenes and locales vary and shift, and screenplay writer Susan Shilliday invents some L'Engle-esque touches of her own (flower storms, glow worms, ect.) Her dialogue is also quite different; it's much subtler though sometimes a bit awkward.

If you are one of those people who look to a literary film adaptation to be a letter-by-letter recount of the book then you'll probably hate this film. And if you're the kind of literary stickler that gets into the whole minutia of hair color I can only further urge you to stay away.  It's NOT the book; it's a film and an updated re-imagining and re-invention of the story in a different medium.  I found the changes compelling, but others may find them more than they can bear.

The book is and always will be a classic, a revelation and a pioneering milestone in the field of great children's literature. Like the works of JK Rowling and CS Lewis, Mrs. L'Engle's gorgeous and superior series will always be near and dear and untainted by ANY film version good or bad.  Their written words have and WILL always stand the test of time.  I doubt this film has the power to ever change that.

Moving on.  In this adaptation all of the actors are relatively faithful to their literary counterparts.  David Dorfman has a wonderfully delicate touch as Charles Wallace, and he's especially effective in his mind control scenes.  He has great skill in allowing us to see both rage and indifference- sometimes in the same sentence!  Gregory Smith is a far move handsome Calvin that I would have imagined, but he finds his own unique way to the character with deadpan humor.

The biggest acting burden falls on the shoulders of Katie Stuart- her Meg has been re-imagined as an introspective tomboy (I kept thinking of a gentler Nancy McKeon from `The Facts of Life').  Her performance serves this movie well, though it sometimes conflicts with the occasional reference to Meg's passion or impatience which isn't always apparent acting wise.

Alfrie Woodard, Alison Elliot and Kate Nelligan do fine as the three Miss W's, thank you. They achieve an otherworldly manor with great human zeal.

Rounding out the principles are Chris Potter and Sarah Jane Redmond as Jack and Dana Murry.  A minor gripe is in this detail- if the screenwriter had read 'An Acceptable Time' she would have discovered their REAL names are Alex and Kate.

Yeah, okay.  Sometimes I can be a literary stickler too.  So there.

Actually my biggest gripe about the film is the whole sequence on planet Lxchel; clunky editing aside, the new ideas writer Shilliday impose simply fall flat here.

The two trips to Camazotz might be the most radically re-written aspect of the film.  The planet has been visually reimagined as a dark George Orwell 1984 kind of society.  And the marvelous work of sound designer Kris Fenske creates an impressively oppressive rhythm for this place not unlike earth.  This time the sheer LOOK of the planet is just as scary as its principals and ideals.

If you're going to update a book written in 1962 you HAVE to make some translative choices to reflect both contemporary setting and sensibility. ""A oversize brain- just larger enough than normal to be completely revolting"" on a dais simply doesn't have the impact it once had in 1962.  I don't want to spoil the surprise, but what the film does instead works quite well.

However, I will divulge that the role of The Man with Red Eyes has been beefed up.  He's deliciously played with dark comic sensibility by Kyle Secor. Another nice touch.

The visual effects occasionally disappoint, and you'll immediately spot the poor ones when you see them. However a special mention must be given to the effects provided for the tesseract.  These sequences do not disappoint.  They astound.  The three children and Miss Whatsit clutch hands on the Star Gazing Rock.  Suddenly Misses Whatsit transforms into her purest self: a mass of light and energy.  Meg looks at her and Misses Whatsit looks right back with eyes peering through her transparent, organic form.  Then the earth falls bellow their feet, the landscape flattens and waves of energy and matter course though them in visual sheets.  They are tessering, and all to the glory of Patric Caird and Jeff Dana's ethereal score. This brought me to tears.

A blink and you might miss it moment also happens here: Charles Wallace, ever so briefly, sees the model of the tesseract in the skyscape.  A glorious touch, and a touching gesture to the fans of this book.

I suspect this was held off the airwaves for nearly two years NOT because of quality but because of content- this story makes some strong demands on young readers, and as a movie it makes equally tough demands. The last half of the film is indeed dark-which probably made The Wonderful World of Disney a little nervous in its apprehension in airing this on TV.  Too bad.  Only through great darkness can the light of day be truly appreciated, and I think most young viewers will find the journey most worthwhile.

Again though, not a perfect film but a highly recommended one nevertheless.

NOTES ON THE DVD EDITION...

`A Wrinkle in Time' was originally supposed to air as a four hour miniseries, but was cut down to a three hour allotted Sunday airing. Interestingly enough, the DVD release of 'A Wrinkle in Time' comes with a bonus of 18 minutes worth of these deleted scenes, featuring Charles Murry at work in his lab with a new character called Hank (again played by Mr. Secor, who'll eventually become The Man With Red Eyes.)  Some lovely scenes in a maze, additional scenes on Lxchel and (YES!) a couple of noteworthy moments where Meg has some harsher outbursts (which was an initial problem I had with Katie Stuart's performance as directed.)

The DVD also include a brief but profound interview with Mrs. L'Engle discussing getting `A Wrinkle in Time' published and some of the personal impacts her tale has since had.  It's very powerful, and worth looking into.

I must confess, I too am baffled by that DVD cover art.  Is that, like, The Wonderful World of Disney castle they're flying over?  Yikes!",1093996800,97,6701,4.764960971379011
