5471603,5,B00AQN7R0C,"Thanks to MHZ for continuing Beck. The series continues with total satisfaction. The film technology gets better, the stars get older, but the writers remain the same. It is just good writing and you never know how the film will end, exactly. The series is albsolute to coin a word used in Swedish to mean great or whatever.",1363392000,,324,4.603448275862069
5471604,5,B00AQN7R0C,"We have thoroughly enjoyed this series of Swedish police investigating murders in and around Stockholm.  Even though it is subtitled in English, it is entertaining and full of twists, turns, and surprises!

We would recommend this series for anyone who finds mystery and solving the crime of murder socially redeeming.",1363219200,4,318,5.34
5471605,5,B00AQN7R0C,"After watching the Sweedish mysteries it is hard to go back to the American ones. Or the British series.
Fortunately Amazon has a few ones in stock and I am ordering them every time I get the announcement of a new arrival.",1359504000,5,222,4.309523809523809

8556508,5,B00AQN7R0C,"Being an avid fan of the Scandinavian Crime genre, I naturally gravitated to the ""Beck"" television series ... and I've been rewarded over and over.  The series is very faithful to the fabulously successful series of books (which I have read and also recommend),  the actors are well cast and the production values first rate.  The ""baddies"" in ""Beck"" are really BAD, while the ""goodies"" chasing them are multi-faceted characters ... sometimes displaying their own unique human character flaws or their messy private lives, but always brilliant at the detective work.  Prepare to be enthralled!",1438300800,,593,5.2105263157894735

8556510,5,B00AQN7R0C,"The writing just keeps getting better and better. Good to see Gunvald's character growing/maturing. I tend to find nordic dramas a bit long, but this one good easily cut the time by getting rid of that pesky neighbor. In fact, I find myself fast forwarding when he is on the screen. Wish that we had something half as good as this on american tv",1426896000,,345,4.40625
8556511,5,B00AQN7R0C,"I bought episodes 4 through 9 as a test (sometimes a series doesn't get its legs until after the kinks have been wrung out of the early episodes), then recently purchased 10 through 18.  Beck grows on you.  Having first watched several of the early Wallander episodes before turning to Beck, I had to get adjusted to a similar character but with his own identity.  I have not been disappointed with Beck.  It's a great Swedish police drama with strong, interesting characters and well written stories.",1403568000,,501,4.790697674418604
8556512,5,B00AQN7R0C,These guys are starting to feel like part of the family after 15 episodes. They interact so well as a team and the plots are always good. Can't wait to start the next set of three. keep them coming.,1400457600,,198,4.102564102564102
8556513,5,B00AQN7R0C,"Next to the Swedish version of Wallander played by Krister Henricksson, Beck is the absolute best detective out there (if you don't count Sherlock Holmes! All the stories are really good and the acting is great.",1395273600,,211,4.888888888888889
8556514,5,B00AQN7R0C,"The best. Thank you for putting out more Becks. A delight to see Peter Haber as a good "" Martin"" after his role in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. As for Grunwald... he is maturing into an extremely likable character. The neighbor... glad I don't have one like him, but you have to love him too! These people know how to act! Great series! PLEASE keep putting them out!",1365033600,2,370,4.3
