2133762,5,B0002X7GV6,You can't go wrong with this collection from Wong Kar Wai.  He has such skill for filming with a creative eye and creating stories that engage you visually and emotionally.  They are 'love' stories like no other and will leave you wanting more...and thankfully with this collection you can watch one after another!  Beautiful works.,1283644800,3,332,5.0

2133764,5,B0002X7GV6,"I don't have a lot to add to ""Randroid""'s review.  Wong Kar-Wai is one of the world's premier directors, making audacious, complex films that grab one's heart.  Influenced by the French New Wave, bent through the prism of Hong Kong cinema, his is a stylish and unique vision.  This box set contains five of his seven films that have been released to DVD:

-- As Tears Go By

-- Days of Being Wild

-- Chungking Express

-- Fallen Angels

-- Happy Together.

Fans of Happy Together will be particularly pleased by the newly remastered Kino version -- I had only viewed a VHS copy before, which was atrocious.  There are also a bunch of new extras on this DVD, including an hour long 'making of' feature.  The other DVDs all seem to be clear and crisp, though without significant extras beyond the usual trailers (there are still galleries and filmographies, and some brief comments by Quentin Tarantino on Chungking Express).

With the exception of Chungking Express, these have not been readily available in stores, and this box set is a cost effective presentation showing the development of a major  directorial talent.  We also get to see some wonderful stars of Hong Kong cinema such as Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung and Leslie Cheung, Andy Lau, Brigitte Lin and Faye Wong, often in roles different from their usual or at crucial points in their careers.

Of his other two films, In The Mood For Love is available in a sumptuous Criterion release.  Unfortunately, Ashes of Time seems to be caught in some kind of 'intellectual property' hell, and the DVD is supposed to be even worse than the VHS, which is barely viewable.  Maybe Kino can somehow gain the rights to Ashes as well and do a decent ramastering.  (Hint to Kino: It would be nice to have a feature explaining some of the historical/literary background that is unfamiliar to western viewers)",1102896000,58,1853,4.7375
2133765,5,B0002X7GV6,"Wong Kar-wai is simply one of the best directors working in Hong Kong today, and in all the world, for that matter. His characters are brilliantly realized, his style is stunningly kenetic, and cinematography (mostly by Christopher Doyle of ""Hero"" fame) is gorgeous. All in all a good set. Thus far, I would rank these films as follows, from best to . . . well, least best:

1. Chungking Express

2. Happy Together

3. Days of Being Wild

4. Fallen Angels

5. As Tears Go By

Be sure to pick up Wong's other film ""In The Mood For Love"", and you'll be sure to be awaiting the American release of his new film, ""2046"". ""Ashes of Time"", sadly, is a terrible DVD, so perhaps a Criterion release is in order?",1098403200,44,703,4.369230769230769
8034061,5,B0002X7GV6,"Each of these movies offer an incredible and rare window into Hong Kong life. It's also a great joy to see Maggie Cheung,Tony Leung, andFaye Wong in their younger years. For anyone whose traveled or lived in Hong Kong, it's a meaningful and artistic trip into HK's vibrant past.",1512950400,,278,4.6938775510204085

8034064,5,B0002X7GV6,"There aren't too many collections available that are dedicated to master filmmaker Wong Kar Wai so if you are interested in seeing his films, this is well worth it. If you have never heard of Wong Kar Wai then this also provides a very nice introduction to his films. The quality of this collection isn't anywhere near the Criterion Collection films but given the price, this is a worthwhile purchase.",1383350400,,401,4.742857142857143
8034065,5,B0002X7GV6,"A nice collection of great movie classics by Wong Kar Wai!
A must buy dvdset for hong kong movie fans!",1373500800,,102,4.15
8034066,3,B0002X7GV6,This box set is basicly a paper sleeve. I woudnt even call it a box set. All my movies play and im giving it 3 stars for the movies there great. Theres no booklets for the box set or for the individual movies. One movie chungking express is made by miramax and the others a company called kino. The box sets wrapped and two dvds came in shrink wrap. 3 didnt. Dont expect anything special out of the boxset itself. The movies by wong kar wai enjoy. You might get lucky and find the movies individually for a cheaper price if you get lucky,1373328000,2,537,4.173076923076923
8034067,2,B0002X7GV6,"This is not how the product looked so would you say it is being misrepresented? Only 4 movies played and the others I believe were a region code other than U.S. I was very disappointed because I wanted this to be part of my movie collection. I believe it was an honest mistake but it cost me money to send it back, very disappointing.",1360713600,,334,4.234375

8034069,5,B0002X7GV6,"I got this box set for my fiance for Christmas one year. The quality is great, and it has a few lesser-known Wong Kar-Wai films that we enjoyed. The cover-art is also quite pretty.",1319328000,4,180,4.323529411764706
