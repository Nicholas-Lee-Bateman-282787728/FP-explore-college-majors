8150540,3,B000JJ4FL2,The DVD is pretty good but the online site is not very helpful. The site is tailored for guitars and Keyboards seem to be an after thought.,1460505600,,139,4.185185185185185

8150543,5,B000JJ4FL2,"This is a great DVD for the novice, as it gets you playing simple chord progressions in no time.
The only problem I ran into, was actually finding the MP3 tracks which (once you sign up), are located as follows:
Pull down your DVD from Keyboards and Piano pain.
On lesson support page, you click on the gray arrow at the bottom of the upper center pain showing your DVD
which says: Right-Click to download all backing tracks here.
They will be downloaded on to your computer in a zip file and you can file them where you want, and also from that
point transfer the ones you want to an MP3 device if you wish.
Albert Margolis is a great teacher, and is easy to follow.
I have a lot of the RockHouse DVD's, and find them some of the best to get you started in whatever you play.",1391385600,,776,4.18
