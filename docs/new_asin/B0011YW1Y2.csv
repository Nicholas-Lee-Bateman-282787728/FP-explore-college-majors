8242942,5,B0011YW1Y2,"Look i a huge WEW fan, so it is so hard for me to give a bad rating to any of their DVDs. Although this show feels a little short, with matches featuring the likes of Lucy Furr(Daffney), Jazz, The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew, Annie Social and more how can you complain? If you like WEW, you'll love this one.",1374537600,,309,4.166666666666667
8242943,5,B0011YW1Y2,If you like Wild & Crazy women wresting this is for you. Some of these girls are just down right Nasty! It is exactly as advertised.,1249516800,,132,4.115384615384615
8242944,1,B0011YW1Y2,In one word this is a lousy DVD. It is the worst of the genre. It is also too short but it is better that way. too bad i cannot get a refund. Also Christina Ricci (film Actress) is not in this title. Shoddy advertising.,1215561600,,219,3.888888888888889
