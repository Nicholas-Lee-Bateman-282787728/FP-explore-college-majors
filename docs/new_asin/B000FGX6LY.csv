Carefully gathered and documented information sources confirm the author's accuracy.",1494633600,,162,6.086956521739131

Do your own research...Fluroide is everywhere...we are being drugged without our knowledge nor permission.  It is costly to add the chemical to our water supply, and costly to have to have medical, surgical help in the older years because of Fluoride deteriorating our soft tissues, our protective tissues in the knees and hips.",1458518400,,449,4.973333333333334

8122453,5,B000FGX6LY,It is very scary that many of the people living in this country is not aware that fluoride is toxic and we are taking it into our body by public water. Don't believe what CDC or government officials tell you; its a big BS. And be aware that filter doesn't purify it.,1379980800,4,266,4.134615384615385
8122454,5,B000FGX6LY,"I recently received a bill in the mail from my Dental Insurance Co, Delta Dental.
The envelope had a statement on the back promoting Municipal Water Flouridation. The ad was simple enough, yet benign, as it noted no details or purported benefits to public water flouridation. The note merely stated that 38% of US cities had yet to add (sodium-)Flouride to their public water systems and that the Surgeon General had recommended they do so.

Why?

Here's your answer, right in this short film on the history of Water Flouridation in America.

Buy it, free your mind, then ask why the media has fallen silent on this public health crisis.

Water Flouridation is killing America, don't stand for it any longer.",1221177600,18,708,4.8264462809917354

  It is no longer necessary to build prison camps for the underclass, the urban domestic centers shall be the prison camps and riot zones.  It is no longer necessary to drive human populations into killing facilities (the archeology of Britain or the 20th Century Holocaust) like showers for gassing droves to death all at once.  There's a water utility connected to each and every dwelling, building, and office tower.  Elections are an almost dissatisfactory lack of any challenge in pushing over, to add insult, going to the trouble of making them look 50:50 only to win by a nose; or that's supposed to be some form of apology for rigging them, when they're illegal polls to begin with.  They must find a way to keep their peers contented somehow with participation, though they must lose.  Certainly no one is to stop and question what is legal or not legal to hold an election for.  The election has become a sacred observance, a procession, and a rite of any religion is never to be questioned, nor who is right about religion.  The hind brained clockwork of primitive human group hierarchical emergence finally has won back a victory over enlightenment, knowledge, science and philosophy.  Lord Apebury has more skins and more concubines, everyone owes him the tribute of unquestioned servile obedience within the clan.

It's all too easy, and there's much more profit to be had bilking the victims of health care insurance investments than killing them before they've paid off.

If a brand of sweetener or a food additive were found to have reasonably direct indication and probability of having caused the US Autism Epidemic, wouldn't that product be removed from the shelf?  Would the injunction take even 48 hours?  American law has been very clear on this, it's called `injury from defective product', ""The principle that someone is responsible has won wide acceptance."", (You and the Law, H.V. Poor); besides which, at our late great, heights of scientific understanding about the interaction of the human body with not only simple compounds and chemical elements, but even the most complex organic drug molecules ever engineered, there can be no reasonable denial of foreknowledge of that product's latent risk of death or injury from ingestion, therefore willful endangerment with prior motif and maintenance of silence to cause death or lifelong debilitating injury, murder one, and aggravated to counts of enormity:  mass murder, and genocide; plus, due to its remorselessly systematic promotion through the media and directly lobbied influence on our state's governments and federal agencies, an act of war on the American people; and not simply covertly applied, subtle form of psychological abuse with a physical act of prolonged terrorism.  There are governments promoting fluoropoisoning and counting their successes in terms of not only large metropolitan areas of the U.S., but cities everywhere in the world.

Why haven't more responsible medical professionals been lofted into the prominence of media exposure denouncing fluoridation?  They have gone on the record in only obscure places.  What controls their opinion or ability to make public statements that are critical of agendas propped up by non-physician bureaucrats in government?  Why are local, small town newspapers left the task of bamboozling and intimidating the public with such medical [...], as if the larger and more scrutinized media could not be found in any association with its clear indications of malice and putting the public in grave danger?
