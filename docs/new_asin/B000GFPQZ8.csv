8131472,1,B000GFPQZ8,This DVD has 2 minutes of usable info for trading the FOREX market and the rest of it was a history lesson.  It also was an infomercial and should have been given away since they are trying to sell you something.,1375574400,,212,4.170731707317073
8131473,1,B000GFPQZ8,"it's just Ed siting at his desk talking..might be useful if you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, but if you have the slightest clue it's a complete waste.  forex for dummies is less money and WAY better.",1232064000,6,195,4.571428571428571
8131474,1,B000GFPQZ8,Do not buy this dvd. You can get more and better free information on virtually any forex broker website. The information provided is about 95% worthless even for a total beginner. This was the worst $24 I ever spent on forex education.,1200096000,5,235,4.619047619047619
