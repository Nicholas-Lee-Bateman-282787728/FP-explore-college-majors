You can easily  find and download movie in English for free as I did. Sure, colors are excellent and interiors even better, sure, plenty of skin and that's it. Plot? Supposedly there is one but the point is nothing is engaging not like Jess Franco or, my favored, Joe D'Amato, in short realism
is missing. The movie is also severely outdated--I should state--its all happened before Muslim invasion, never mind WW2.
If you wanna real movie try Jess Franco 'Downtown'",1486598400,,584,5.083333333333333

American Henry Miller enjoyed a wide variety of sexual escapades while also working hard to establish himself as a serious writer in the Paris of the inter-war years (1919-1939).

Jours tranquilles  Clichy is a 1990 film directed by Claude Chabrol. It is based on the autobiographical novel by Henry Miller. The multiple producers already promise trouble: AZ Film Production, Cinecitt, Italfrance Films, Direkt-Film, Istituto Luce, Cofimage 2.

The novel was previously adapted into a 1970 Danish film, criticised as pornographic. Whatever it may mean these days (anything from showing nipples to sodomy for the masses), Chabrol's film is not pornographic. A lot of decorative nudity, like the 1980 Caligula, mixed with some acceptable acting.

Only highlight is to see Stphane Audran again, Chabrol's former wife.
