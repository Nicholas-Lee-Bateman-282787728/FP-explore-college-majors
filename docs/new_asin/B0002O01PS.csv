8029802,3,B0002O01PS,"This DVD is about 75% boobs /butts, 15% fights, and 10% people just acting bizarrely.  It doesn't show complete dates but rather 45 minutes of short clips from some of the craziest dates.  It's mildly entertaining but I was hoping for more fights and weirdos rather than silicone boobs everywhere.",1419379200,2,297,4.92

8029804,3,B0002O01PS,"I loved ""Blind Date"" when it was on tv. I was so excited when they announced there would be an ""uncensored"" version. So I went straight out and got it. It was good but very very short (approx. 45 mins.). To my surprise alot of my favorite dates were not included. So I then decided to get the ""extended version"" with more scenes the ones that were ""too hot to be aired"". It was nice but it was the same dvd with an extra 15 mins. and still the dates I wanted to see were not there! They advertise more that ""5000 hours of footage"" yet some of the best ones are not on the dvd. Well come to my surprise I find out that Blind Date has put out pay-per-view specials worth $9.99 each featuring some of those favorite scenes I mentioned. And to add insult to injury the ppv are not totally ""uncensored"". So if you are looking for alot of dates in this dvd you won't be satisfied. I say get playboy tv's foursome its better.",1365724800,2,918,4.134078212290503
8029805,5,B0002O01PS,"I love Blind Date is its was on the air over 10 years ago, it was one of the best reality show ever on. So when i purchased ""Blind Date: Uncesored"" it bought back memories of the do and don't when on a blind date. It entertain when two stranges meet, go out and you don't know what to expect at the end. Weather its will lead to a second date and a possible commitment or it will turn into a disaster with no chance of a second date and both don't want to see eachother again (there was most of that).
But i really enjoyed this DVD, mainly for the humore and the sexual content/ nudity that you can't see in the TV version.",1354838400,2,623,3.992
