8729390,5,B0142S82NC,"This workout is really awesome.  It is difficult but not as difficult as the other physique 57 dvds.  It's great for starting out in the physique 57 workouts!  I do this along with the other videos.  It is a good full body workout in only 30 min, and does create change and toning in the body.",1489104000,3,293,4.178571428571429
8729391,5,B0142S82NC,"This is a quick and challenging workout, easily modified if your flexibility isn't quite to the level of the DVD, and the lead is very chipper and encouraging without being irritating.  She's also good to talk about being stronger, healthier, picking your goal, thinking strong, etc., rather than focusing all her comments on skinny and sexy as the goal (which happens in some of the other videos).
A really great half hour!  But beware: if you're doing this during your toddler's naptime, or another occasion where you may not be guaranteed the full 30 min, you'll need to finish the workout later as you do one side of the body in the 1st half and the other in the 2nd half!",1470009600,5,676,4.578512396694215

8729394,5,B0142S82NC,I love these videos. They really work on heavy legs a bottoms. Don't give up!,1453593600,,77,4.2
8729395,5,B0142S82NC,I take the classes at the studio but being back at work has me short on time and not able to go to class. This is a challenging and effective workout. Very good all around short workout. Highly recommend!,1452470400,3,204,4.256410256410256
8729396,4,B0142S82NC,"I just completed this workout less than 5 minutes ago. I am between 5'9"" and 5'10"" and am approximately 135 lbs. Lately, my workout has primarily been walking. This workout is almost 35 minutes with a fast warm-up and a little bit of yoga-esque poses for a cool down.

Liked: Lack of equipment, modifications for advanced or beginner, exhausts one side of the body then switches, instructor gives good pointers to ensure correct form (she is fairly talkative for those who do not like that), music is not loud (you can easily play your own), a lot of strength and flexibility poses that keep a cardio effect, which you can usually enhance.

Disliked: Not enough arm work (primarily a few push-ups/tricep dips), horrible cool down music, need quite a bit of clear area around you.

Overall, I enjoyed this workout. This is especially great on the go. However, if my focus was on my arms or back, I would not recommend this. I will definitely do this again. It was challenging, but it was also brief, didn't require equipment and I felt good afterwards!",1447027200,9,1051,4.701086956521739
