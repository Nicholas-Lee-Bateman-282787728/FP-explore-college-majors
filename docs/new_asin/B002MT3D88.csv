which is great, i had been interested in the documentary about this concert by stefan paul, have not been able to find it yet.",1349913600,,168,4.28125
3952492,5,B002MT3D88,"I love this concert! Bob Marley was great he danced a lot in this one and I've seen the others; he was definitely at his best in this one. Love, love, love!",1334707200,7,156,3.90625
3952493,5,B002MT3D88,"I am a huge fan and collector about Bob's work, and this DVD is SPECTACULAR!!!!  It starts with an I-Threes presentation where they perform 3 or 4 songs and bob starts with Natural Mystic, it gives me goose bumps remembering!! I have seen it for like 4 or 5 times and it haven't passed a week since I bought it...

It is one of the last if no THE LAST performance caught on tape only a few months before Bob stop playing and start his treatment!!

If you're a BMW fan you MUST buy it!!

JAH BLESS!!!",1328140800,12,499,4.11340206185567
8374038,1,B002MT3D88,"I guess if you adore Bob Marley, you've never heard of YouTube (maybe you're from another planet!), and you have money to throw down the toilet, you can consider buying this.

But caveat emptor - Let the buyer beware!!!

As one reviewer has already said, this is an unofficial = bootleg version (see photo). The film is available for free on YouTube, and the ironic thing is that there's a much better vid of this same concert on YouTube, too.

And one more stupid thing: The lousy-quality video has been recoded from its original 4:3 dimension to 16:9, so that even skinny-as-a-rail Bob Marley (he died less than a year after this was recorded) looks ""puffy"".

To be honest, I'm surprised Amazon even allows this to be sold.",1519430400,,725,4.640625

8374041,5,B002MT3D88,"A great concert on par with LIVE @ THE RAINBOW 78"".GREAT PICTURE & SOUND & THE LAST CONCERT recorded before BOB passed a year later. A must have for any BMW fan.",1408406400,,161,4.0625
8374042,5,B002MT3D88,"First off, Bob Marley's 1977 Live DVD is by far the best Video quality of Marley but THIS 1980 concert to me is his best live show captured on film. It contains cuts from his great 1979 Survival and his last 1980 Uprising album. Great show full of energy, the band super tight, just an amazing show! I also have to think that Bob prob knew something was wrong with him at this point, you cant have cancer all through your body and be feeling great, it would be just a short 3 months later when he was told by his Doctors that he was filled with cancer and they gave him 3 weeks to live, he lived 7 months longer though through his strong will. This show is just a excellent show and is well filmed. IF i had to only own 1 DVD of Bob Marley, this  would be it.",1405728000,,759,3.9934210526315788

8374045,3,B002MT3D88,"The music is outstanding and yes this is one of Bob's last concerts, however, the digital picture is not so good. Granted I have a 3d plasma TV so it is not going to be great. But my old DVD concerts of Bob, Santa Barbra Bowl, and Live at the Rainbow are better..",1377734400,2,263,3.981132075471698
