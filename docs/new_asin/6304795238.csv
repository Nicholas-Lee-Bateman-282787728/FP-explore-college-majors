7877091,5,6304795238,"'Manos,' from Season Four, and 'The Gunslinger,' from Season Five, are two of the best episodes from Mystery Science Theater 3000's middle years. In fact, 'Manos' may be the most popular MST episode ever -- and people who know that fact will no doubt want the MST outtakes reel 'Poopie!' as well. So how can you lose?
I've reviewed each of these videos more thoroughly on the individual titles' own pages. It's enough to say here that Rhino did a nice job picking these three to shrink-wrap into a combo-pack. Every MSTie's gotta have 'Manos,' and 'Poopie!' will keep the dedicated fan rolling in the metaphorical aisles.",1006819200,2,621,4.813084112149533
7877092,4,6304795238,"This is by far the best MST3K 3-pack yet. I believe it was also one of the first. Manos is my favorite episode of all time. It's pretty tough to find something that makes me laugh as much as that. Of course, Poopie comes darn  close. Fans of the show will love the loads of outtakes. I know I did.  Gunslinger is a fairly good episode with plenty of laughs. Well worth the  price!",957398400,3,380,4.108108108108108
7877093,5,6304795238,"The Poopie reel is great, Manos, is well...it makes the bots cry and me laugh and Gunslinger sort of dragged for me. All still hilarious of course but I watched Manos and the Poopie reel most out the trio.",925257600,7,205,4.282051282051282
