8506006,5,B006X08D82,"Definitely worth 5 stars! I've been buying nearly every Max Milligan or Play Series instructional DVD I come across because I'm looking to broaden my horizons as a guitar player!

Steve Cropper Play Series: let me start by saying... Wow I spent roughly 45 minutes with this DVD and I learned a great deal! This DVD teaches you about triads through practical application rather than using heavy or intimidating chord theory! Even if you're not familiar with Steve Cropper you should buy this DVD. I saw a comment about the DVD not including: tabs or PDF files. Tabs and PDF are useful but we shouldn't be reliant on them I tell you now this DVD doesn't need them.

As an instructor Max is a heck of nice guy and creates a classroom like atmosphere. The price for this DVD is currently trending at just below $7 everywhere at all online vendors and the video is roughly 60mins the average price of good guitar lessons is about $40-$60 an hour.

Give this DVD a chance you won't be disappointed!",1468281600,3,992,4.561797752808989
8506007,5,B006X08D82,I've always admired Cropper's work--especially with Booker T. & the MGs. Max Milligan provides the licks to help students capture the spirit of Cropper's style. The rest is up to us.,1457395200,2,182,4.903225806451613
8506008,5,B006X08D82,these are all great by a great teacher,1454630400,,38,3.875
8506009,4,B006X08D82,"Very good Material, no Tabs included, so it takes much more time to figure out, what Max means. However, the Music he introduces is wonderful and if you take the time, well worth the effort. For five stars I would need a PDF with Tabs on the disk.",1433116800,5,247,4.166666666666667
8506010,5,B006X08D82,"I have about 10 Max Milligan instructional DVDs (Allman, Hendrix, SRV, Ry Cooder, Fingerpicking).  This is one of his best.  If you want to incorporate triads into your playing  . . .  BUY THIS DVD.",1376352000,5,198,4.571428571428571
