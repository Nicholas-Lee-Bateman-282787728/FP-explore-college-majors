965683,4,6305110212,"The story takes place in Australia and it revolves around a rich rancher who trades horses but is now in financial debt. Add in a neghbouring bad rich rancher who wants to take over his settlement and you've got a story. Long story short is that the good rancher dies and his daughter played by Tushka Bergen is left with his property/problem. In comes Ben Creed played by Jeff Fahey to help out Alice and the battle for the ranch begins.

The movie itself is pretty good but I was disspointed with this DVD release. The movie is presented in Fullscreen format but near the end it switches to Widescreen for the last few minutes. What the hell? Also, the sound dissapeares for a brief second at one point. The picture quality is acceptable so other than those two annoyances its a solid DVD, the price is good too.",1193270400,22,814,4.4630872483221475
965684,2,6305110212,"""The Wrangler"" starring Jeff Fahey was an Australian production created in 1989 directed by Ian Barry, wriiten by John Sexton and starring Jeff Fahey(Australia was till emerging from the throws of cultural cringe and importing stars rather than exporting them) and Tushka Bergen. In Australia the film was released under the title ""Minnamurra"". I agree with the previous comment in that it is the best thing I've seen Jeff Fahey do, but that isn't saying much! If you want something to pass a rainy winter afternoon, like horses and can over look some pretty ordinary acting from its stars it is worth a look for the outstanding Australian support cast. If your after the Wrangler starring Jason Evers and produced in 1960. Sorry you're out of luck here.",1150243200,,754,4.8984375
965685,5,6305110212,this is the best movie i have ever seen and the only Jeff Fahey movie is have ever seen whit him in it. I think it's his best.,1109808000,,126,3.5357142857142856
965686,2,6305110212,I found the movie hard to follow and it didn't have the greatest plot. I wouldnt pay $10 for it.,957398400,,96,3.85
965687,5,6305110212,"This film (theatrical release 1988, video release date April 1999) will prove to be a favorite of Jeff Fahey fans, and general movie-goers alike.  It was filmed in Australia, and is visually stunning.  Story revolves  around a teenage girl's life and the people and situations she encounters  in turn of the century Australia.  Her character, Alice May Richards  (played by Tushka Bergen) grows up on a horse ranch; has to deal with the  farm going bankrupt, her father's death, getting shipped off to the city  away from the life and horses she loves.  Meanwhile she meets Ben Creed  (Jeff Fahey) a dashing, hardworking broker, who falls for her, but her  attentions are focused on a macho and less interesting horseman on her  ranch...I won't spoil it for you, but this movie is highly interesting for  character development and the twists and turns of the plot.  This was  probably a huge hit in Australia...I have purchased this video a total of  seven times for gifts since I originally viewed it in June of 1999.  Excellent choice for young girls who are horse lovers...and a very  excellent effort by Jeff Fahey as well.  Again, the visual aspects of the  beautiful countryside, the horses, characters costumed perfectly in turn of  the century clothing, and great plot and all round acting makes this film a  real winner! Enjoy! (Note: no nudity, or situations unsuitable for a G  audience!) A real GEM!",947030400,47,1411,4.860759493670886

965917,5,6305110212,"I saw this on TMC and it was a great story. The chemistry between the two leads is great, the setting for the movie done well. I wish it were longer because the scenery and actors were great. The male lead is charming and he alone is worth the movie! The charge between the stubborn girl and him is well done. Again, I'm a mush fan so I wish it had even more. *Spoiler*-at the beginning she likes another guy, fights with our guy, then realizes she wants our guy.* Great, right? It IS-but again, wish there was more because I saw more potential there. But a great movie, worth adding to your collection.",1408924800,,603,4.298245614035087
965918,5,6305110212,"Another one of my favorite movies.  It takes place in Australia.  A young woman is sent to finishing school where she meets up with a cow hand and is also re-introduced to a man who came to do business with her father.  While she is at finishing school her father dies and she goes home.  Soon she discovers that her father was over his head in debt.  She sets out to lesson the debt.  Unbeknownst to her, this business man obtains the deed to Minniemarra, her home, for her so her crooked neighbor can't have it and he loses it due to an act of vengeance  which ruins his very lucrative business.  The business man, the girl, and the cowhand all come together to regain her land.  Both the cowhand and the business man are in love with her.  She does choose one in the end.  Its a western romance and I enjoy watching it.  Also has some beautiful horses in it.",1405728000,2,861,4.246913580246914
965919,3,6305110212,"I stopped this movie about a quarter of the way in, so I can't give a really good opinion of it.  It wasn't pulling me in, so I just turned it off.  I may yet try it again.",1402444800,,172,3.5

965921,4,6305110212,This movie is very good if you like westerns and I do.  Jeff  Fahey is great. And good story line!,1395187200,,98,3.85
965922,2,6305110212,The dialogue was muffled.  The movie was boring to me.  There was not enough about Australia's land and customs.  Jeff Fahey was emotionless.,1386720000,,141,5.043478260869565
965923,1,6305110212,I don't know if the movie was any good since from the very start of play it kept pausing and was simply unwatchable.,1378252800,,116,4.086956521739131

966029,5,6305110212,"WOW!! Such incredible scenery, fantastic actors - Jeff Fahey wow, what a fantastic looking bloke! All acting was credible..The music filled you with the right moods as the story progressed. The action scenes were incredible to look at. I love the Man From Snowy River movies, which are incredible - and these kinds of movies are hard to do at all in the Australian countryside. But this movie, falls just behind the Snowy River movies - though its hard to make a bad movie, with the incredible horses that are the brumbies, and the Australian scenery. Added to this are the incredible lovely homes that are involved in this story line..And a wonderful bad guy played with relish! A movie that can be watched many many times. You won't be dissappointed at all. Even those who don't love horses, will be drawn into the storyline. A movie without excessive swearing or love scenes (dont think there was any swearing)  - a  movie the whole family can watch together and enjoy. A good old fashioned story of good and bad guys..Wish more were made in Australia with the brumbies and scenery and uplifting music. Many good tales could be told. A very uplifting movie, where good wins over evil.",1363824000,,1187,4.701923076923077

I've lost all info regarding sending it back...so since it wasn't costly will just keep it and not worry about it.
The shipping was great and timely so it wasn't the customer service. Besides the item was used.  I am sure when they test these things out they don't watch the entire disc.",1323302400,,368,4.492537313432836

966034,4,6305110212,"Dear reader, allow me to say that I am a huge fan of the western genre, and this film seemed attracting to me (mainly by the awesome cover art.) I was at my best friend's house when we saw this and as the film progressed I was really impressed by the films character development, the acting performances, the politics of the day and the love triangle was so well told that it kept my best friend's attention and my mine. Now the film does is slow passed and might bore some people, but that all aside it is a fun film to watch. But again if your looking for a shoot em up don't bother. To conclude I will say this, I do recommend it. It is well done for a TV show that aired in the 80s. It's really too bad that today we do not have any western TV shows.",1262131200,4,754,3.9671052631578947
966035,5,6305110212,"The cinematography is outstanding -- especially any of the scenes featuring the roundup of the wild horses near the sea and in the mountains. The actors are good and all well selected for their parts.  (Jeff Fahey fans will especially enjoy this movie.)  The background music is beautiful and hauntingly memorable.  I would like to see more emphasis on Australian culture.  There were no aboriginees or wild animals specific to this part of the world, which would probably be included if the film was made today.  However, this doesn't distract from a good story that leaves the viewer with a warm feeling.  I imagine the critic reviews when it was originally released in Australia must have been very favorable, and wish there were special features about the making of the movie.  Fun movie to watch more than once.",1248393600,2,816,4.869565217391305
966036,4,6305110212,"A young Jeff Fahey is in the movie that is so well reviewed below.  Kind of a sweet little movie, till our virginal heroine suddenly falls into bed after clearly establishing that she is not that kind of girl.

I was surprised at the authenticity of costumes, etc.  Something about horses makes any movie more majestic.

It was not as strong as I would have liked.  The movie business is a competitive one, and it seems a waste to put all that money and energy into something that doesn't grab you in some way and keep you watching.

It's gotta be more than just the blue eyes.",1233273600,2,577,4.345794392523365

7882948,4,6305110212,"Do you like horses? British/Australian olden times culture and everyman life dramas breaking out of the British caste system? Australians do horse & nature movies well, and though this is not as sophisticated as modern films, the horse footage is great, and there's an enjoyable freshness and honesty like American culture and westerns in this romantic tale of a beautiful young  equestrienne and two handsome  entrepreneurs of the Edwardian Era well-reproduced here in the less restrictive wild-west setting of Australia.
