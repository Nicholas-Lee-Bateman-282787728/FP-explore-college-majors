""I LOVE Garfield and Odie he is sooooo cute.  What I love more than anything is the colors! They are so bright.""

Perfect Pizza - ""I love pizza too. Garfield likes pizza even though it wasn't good. He ate it anyway because he eats everything. Garfield was picky for the first time because he likes real pizza made with love!""

Lucky Charm- ""Garfield and Odie see a rainbow. I love rainbows. Odie wants to get to the end of the rainbow and finds the pot of gold but a leprechaun wants it back so he promises to give them good luck. Garfield's good luck doesn't seem like good luck when all his family moves in with him.  He is funny painting one of his friends black so that a black cat could walk in front of him to lose some bad luck.""

Extreme Housebreaking - ""I've seen this one before. It is funny because John thinks he can train Garfield to be a good cat. I feel bad when Garfield is put in a cage to be like Kittykins, he looks so sad.  Kittykins is really Garfield's friend George and when Garfield finds out he decides to show everyone how the training program doesn't work.""

Mailman Blues - ""Garfield is mean to mailman. They never want to bring the mail to his house.  Bothering mailmen is one of Garfield's favorite things. HA...it was funny when the Mailman went up in the air. My brother was laughing hard. We thought we were going to pee our pants. My favorite part was the little chihuahuas.""

It's a Cheese World - ""I love this one. The mice are so cute. They all talk funny and have funny voices. They want Garfield to take them to Cheese Land.  Kittykiins (George) is back and works at the park to keep all cats out.  He can't keep Garfield out.""  Cheese Land gets eaten by the mice.""

Super Me - ""Garfield and his friend watch a super hero show about Ultra Powerful Guy.  Garfield won't share his snacks with his little cute friend. His cute friend is able to get pizza because he is so super cute. Garfield decides to be a super hero. It is funny that people just carry food in their cars to give the super cute cat. I can't remember super cute cat's name.""",1338249600,3,2245,4.324582338902148

8511972,5,B0077PTX3G,"In the mail at the end of last week was The Garfield Show: Summer Adventures. Even though I am over thirty years old, I am still a Garfield fan. I grew up on the Saturday Morning Garfield & Friends cartoon and I now own them on DVD. I was disappointed with the two live/CGI movies and I had mixed feeling about the three direct-to-DVD computer animated movies. The Garfield Show is actually made in France and it airs in the United States on the Cartoon Network. At first I was a little skeptical about the new computerized animation, but after a few episodes I got use to it. Frank Welker, who voiced the fat cat in the three animated movies, returns for the new series. Unlike the movies, it follows a similar format to Garfield & Friends, minus the U.S. Acres; with normally two eleven minutes episodes.

In the newest release titled Summer Adventures, Garfield and his friends stumble upon a pot of gold in Lucky Charms; Garfield tries to save his favorite pizza place in Perfect Pizza; Garfield goes to a strange theme park in It's a Cheese World; John sends Garfield to a pet school in Extreme Housebreaking; Garfield takes on a new mailman in Mailman Blues; Garfield becomes a superhero in Super Me; and in the bonus episode Fame Fatale, Garfield switches places with a famous cat.

What disappoints me with The Garfield Show DVDs is that they only have six to seven 11 minute episodes. I wish they would just release a full season set. I understand that their main target is kids, and in this economy parents would rather buy a $10 dollar cartoon than a $40 one.

The Garfield Show: Summer Adventures is a great DVD to own for Garfield fans and a great way to introduce kids to Garfield.",1339027200,6,1695,4.532679738562091
