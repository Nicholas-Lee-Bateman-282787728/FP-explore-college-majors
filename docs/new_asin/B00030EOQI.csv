2155467,1,B00030EOQI,"i saw the first one of these years ago when i was still young and trying to figure out why my girlfriend didn't want me to listen to queen and rush. well when i watched it i was scared to death, so needless to say i got rid of all my music, regretably. some christians do things while they seem right to do they usually forget the god can redeem anything that he so chooses. there are many redemptive things in music from all generations. just because they don't say jesus doesnt mean they are evil. just because the doors were pretty weird for their time dosent mean that they have nothing significant to say about the meaning of life. god is far bigger than some stupid video about the evils of ""secular music."" this topic is done. i am a christian but i believe that there are some of us that need to let god work through what he wills. these same people think that drinking a beer is wrong so what do you expect.

2155468,5,B00030EOQI,"How many times have you heard a pro-traditional marriage song on the radio? Or one that promotes monogamy? Or how about respecting your parents? Why is that, you think?

A powerful, well-produced account of the evil that pervades the music industry. Whether discussing popular acts or obscure bands, the producers show conclusively the deliberate intention of a vast number of performers, musicians, and producers to use music as the medium to change or even destroy cultural and moral norms. What may sound like innocent pop music turns out, in fact, to contain lyrics that suggest listeners engage themselves in all manner of immoral acts, including sexual sin, drug use, anarchy, violence, and rebellion. And there is no denying a common source for such ""inspiration"", especially after seeing the producers lay out example after example of people using the same sentences (and nearly word for word!) in their lyrics, something which gives us insights into the philosophy of many musical acts.

As an avid music listener and musician myself, I was surprised by the breadth of the bands and musicians that the 2-disc DVD covered.

One of the many great features of the documentary is that it includes footnotes on the videos so that you can reference them yourself.

Another great feature is the highlighting of hypocrisy in the music industry. Who hasn't seen someone win an award and give thanks to God? Well, a well-worded quote from an unexpected source, Marilyn Manson (!), points out the irony that those very same people make their fortunes doing all sorts of immoral acts and even suggesting others do them, too.

Also noteworthy is the fact that while the producers have censored a lot of videos, viewers can still see that there is definitely an evil spirit behind the making of most videos, one that thrives on sexual sin.

6 1/2 hours might be a little too intense for some, but the producers have divided it into 8 sections of differing lengths.

Overall, after watching this, you will definitely want to be careful what you listen to and warn others also. If you're a musician, you'll also be inspired to try to find ways to use your talents to counteract the decay that pop music has brought on. I know I did.",1397779200,,2225,4.854881266490765

Using the Bible as well as quotes from historians, musicians and experts in various fields, this 6.5 hour video makes an utterly thorough examination of the moral & spiritual worldviews which are being disseminated by popular music.

2155473,5,B00030EOQI,"Hells Bells is by far the best expose of the music industry I have ever seen. Mr. Holmberg presents his well researched and bible based material in a excellent manner. He doesn't get caught up with trying to villify individual singers or ranting about how bad things are getting but instead shows how the music we listen to has a spiritual effect on us. We are told by the music industry that the music we listen to doesn't have any effect on us no matter how vulgar, degenerate, or immoral it is. This video clearly shows the importance of carefully selecting what we listen to. When I was younger, I listened to rock music and was captivated by it even though I knew that much of it promoted things that were in direct contradiction to God's word. I guess I thought that because I knew the difference between right and wrong I would not be affected by the music I listened to. This video series helped to educate me on the fact that no one is immune to the subtle satanic influence of popular music and that the music and other entertainment we allow into our lives has an effect on us, for better or for worse. I highly recommend this video, watching it is time well spent.",1303603200,3,1176,4.39908256880734

2155475,1,B00030EOQI,"Typical christian propaganda. Overall, much of the same as the first, just repackaged, though still amusing. Ironically, much of the accusations and erstwhile {and obviously biased} 'observations' on the genres 'examined' are implemented by... christinsanity on its own followers in their own insidious manner. On the 'right' hand, Christian ""music"" remains some of the most bland, mediocre, and otherwise plagiaristic forms of ear sores in existence.

Those who are influenced by such amusements beyond the realm of entertainment will continue to fester in delusion within a dualistic paradigm, and remain in servile stasis. The reality is that most who listen to these genres, or most films for that matter, are merely harmless programmed sheeple who will consume what is put in front of them when touted as desirable entertainment, however talentless.

If the music cited actually inspires suicidal tendencies & self-destructive behavior in the weak of mind, then good riddance. Darwinian Law takes precedence. If it inspires homicide, then the herd has been thinned. Criminals use whatever misperceived justifications they can to commit crime, and they shall suffer the consequences of their actions. If this presentation serves to attract black sheep back to church, then good riddance as well.

On the 'other' hand, the intelligent, stable and evolved individual can derive gratification from whatever preferred entertainment desired, as proper balanced perspective is naturally maintained.",1299110400,5,1496,5.669642857142857
2155476,4,B00030EOQI,"I first encountered Hells Bells when I was about 12 at my Christian missionary school in Paraguay, South America. It scared the living daylights out of me, but I also found it deeply fascinating. The occultic symbolism and underlying philosophies were unknown to me as a kid, and my eyes were opened.

Hells Bells 2 contains updated material for more recent times as well as redone material from the first documentary. The presenter is a likeable and seemingly fair-minded individual who examines the music on offer as objectively as he can given his fundamentalist Christian worldview. It is well put together, and holds your interest throughout, even though I am not able to agree with all the condemnations that are sent forth from his likeable mouth.

I am the son of missionaries who now makes a living singing folk and rock music. I sing Christian songs but predominately non-Christian material. In fact I sing songs by many of the artists featured in this series. I think it is possible to listen to the music, understand the message, and make your own response to it. When I sing 'Imagine' I dismiss the lyrics as, at best, naively Utopian claptrap, but people respond to the music often because it evokes feelings from a time and place in history, or gives them a sense of comfort, not because they are endorsing the worldview. I think Bill Hicks was a brilliant comedian but I disagreed with 80% of his politics and found him to be excessively cruel on occasions. There is a sense in which art, though not beyond the realm of morality, can be judged on it's own terms.

I found the overtly evangelistic tones of the presentation to be a bit overdone. There was a hint of scare tactics and manipulation about 5 hours of how rock music is evil and popular culture morally bankrupt, and then the bleak prospect of hell is held up as the only alternative to praying the sinner's prayer at the end. I didn't resent this personally, but could imagine that it would be off-putting to many non-believers. Plus, there is a tendency for Christians to cluster around sub-culture 'Christian' music that is often a pale imitation of pop culture, with Christian motifs bolted on and not to engage with the culture. In addition, whatever the beliefs and actions of many of the bands in Hells Bells 2, a lot of them are brilliant musicians and are very entertaining. I can't think of a better recipe to make a disaffected kid want to get into music then by telling him it's subversive and that he shouldn't listen to it. Human nature dictates that this will awaken desire to find out what one is missing.

That said, I am giving this documentary four stars. It is highly informative, well-put together and honest and direct. I would recommend it as a a good vehicle for discussion between parents and their kids, or youth groups. At the very least, it informs about the currents prevalent in popular culture and beyond, though if we were to stop watching the films, reading the books and listening to the music of artists whose worldviews we found contradicted our own, we would have a less interesting cultural landscape, and less to debate!",1297296000,6,3136,4.717153284671533

2155478,1,B00030EOQI,"I have not interest in christianity or christ, but I do have interest in music... when I was a kid I attended a french catholic school, one day;  the priests showed us the original Hell's Bells... while most of my mates cheered when guns & roses and poison appeared, I was more interested in hendrix, led zeppelin or the beatles, after that day, i decided to look for these and many other artists albums (of course I had heard the beatles, but the fact that they were considered satanic, made me want to listen more of them)... I can say hell's bells changed my life, but not in the way intended by the mullet-guy that preaches, It showed me lots of bands/artist otherwise unavailable through radio at the time.

But then I listened about this so-called ""sequel"", I rented it, and I must say
First: this is nothing but an updated version of the old 80s video, the guy looks older, and they name many new bands, but even the most hilarious parts of hells bells I are recreated here completely; like the poisoned M&Ms, or Withney Houston singing to a dead guy. (they should have changed her for beyonce or something)
Second: while the original hell's bells displayed many underground and obscure bands (like Venom), this new ""documentary"" focuses on mainstream pop, and nu-metal like limp bizkit, for a younger viewer may be a way to discover some bands but nothing like the original.

if they found something wrong in all the important rock acts in history... why they never mentioned the clash?... they rock!",1281139200,4,1508,4.661654135338346
2155479,1,B00030EOQI,"As a practicing born again Christian I say, ""Shame on you Eric Holmberg!!"" After sitting through only an hour and a half of watching sexually explicit video clips, horrific blasphemous images of the cross being mocked in grotesque ways, I had to turn this profane documentary off, and trash it! One does not need to read the Satanic Bible to know that its evil! One does not have to show me video clips of porn-rock queen Madonna masturbating herself, or making out with men, and women, or Marilyn Manson spewing out poisonious obscenities to arenas full of crowds giving the finger to cameras, or rock stars having violent orgies on stage to tell me its evil. What scares me most is that churches across America will show this to youth groups!!! After watching this I went to bed with wicked images in my mind, and lustful thoughts! Eric, if you truly want to serve Jesus by reaching out to our lost, brainwashed, youth preach the word!!! Don't aggravate or provoke these people with more wickedness. Putting a smattering of Bible verses throughout this video is hardly powerful when the backdrop are satanic violent video clips. The Holy Spirit and the word of God does the convicting, and heart changing. Why would you spend 4 years looking at these videos to make this one? How much time did you put into watching sexually explicit videos of Britney Spears, Madonna, and all the other rap, scantly clad, (mostly naked), hip hop artists to edit enough out to make Hells Bells 2? That in itself causes me to wonder what your motive is. How could you watch hour after hour of videos like this and not be affected spiritually?!!!! I will set NO wicked thing before my eyes. Psalm 119. Job said I have made a covenant with my eyes before the Lord. This video does more damage than good to believers and non believers alike. How do the drum rhythms of Africa really lead one to repentance? The one edifying thing in this video was the testimony of the former Slayer fan. That's what you should be focusing in on- the transforming grace of Christ. It's quite obvious that music, Hollywoood, sports icons, and media moguls have an major evil influence in our society. I don't need to watch it. As a former occultic rock guitarist myself, all this did was cause me to stumble. My recommendation to true believers is to avoid this video like the plague. Putting a disclaimer at the beginning of the video does not justify or even do justice to the magnitude of what you're about to watch.",1269648000,19,2482,4.630385487528344
2155480,5,B00030EOQI,"This is an eye-opening examination of contemporary music culture. Hells Bells examines the historical, philosophical and (anti) Spiritual roots of much of rock music and points out its effect of much of contemporary culture. This is not just a religious screed or an uptight polemic. The video doesn't rely on interviews with talking heads or ""hell fire"" Pastors ranting and raving, rather,  Hells Bells relies on video and the musician's and fan's own words to make its points. Also, there is plenty of historical background data and scientific observation to push the central thesis of the work. The video does not attempt to trash all rock music, or even modern music in general, but is an honest and open minded study on the dark side of rock and its implications for us all. It is another home run by Eric Holmberg and The Apologetics Group. A must see DVD.",1248307200,5,862,4.785234899328859
2155481,5,B00030EOQI,"I have cut and pasted the most of the review I did for Hell's Bells 1 because everything I wrote fits here and this is even better than the first.

An incredible amount of research went into this body of work. I also had it on vhs (both I & II) and was thrilled to get them on dvd.

As a music lover and musician and someone very interested in messages and content of music it is fascinating.

The video was produced by Christians but I didn't feel it was preachy, and I believe they went out of their way to say they are trying to provide information to help people make informed decisions, whatever they may be.

Personally I believe music has the power to influence moods and thoughts, so I want things that will encourage me with positive content, or at least neutral. If a song is glorying rape, drugs, treating females abusively or other toxic content I have no time for it. I can enjoy any style or form of music, but the content and message need to be something beneficial or at least neutral.

For people that would disagree that music influences moods and thought, I can share that last week I was feeling quite discouraged and I put on Jars of Clay's newest cd, Long Fall Back To Earth and I was inspired with hope much like meeting with a friend, and my mood was lifted up. I personally cannot say that I have experienced hope listening to music with negative or neutral messages, and I have listened to too many hours of music to count in my 40+ years with positive, negative and neutral messages.

I view the dvd's as unique documentaries on one of my favorite topics, and spiritually very encouraging. I don't think anyone is out to control anyone here, and I encourage people to keep open minds to some powerful content.

I also would like to recommend Hell's Bells with 5 stars as well. It is becoming dated and has some cheesy moments (like many things produced in the 1980's)  but it is also fascinating and more focus on 60's, 70's and 80's era music.

2155485,5,B00030EOQI,This is the greatest documentary on rock and roll music from a christian perspective ever made. It is a deep look into the influence of rock and roll music and the satanism behind it. It's a wake up call to the church and our culture about the rebellion and violence it creates.

2155487,4,B00030EOQI,"Just as the sweetness of grace in faith, repentance, holiness, submission and obedience to  and communion with God through personal and corporate prayers and worship, and all other passive and active graces bestowed by Him to those who believe in Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the saints in this world is a foretaste of heaven, so also the filth, rage and oozing of the hateful, lustful, violent, anarchistic, narcissistic, rebellious spirit of the prince of the air, displayed particularly through the popular music including but not limited to Rock and Roll, is a foretaste of hell. The much-despised and doubted argument that most popular music is satanic is not new. What is new in these two CD's presented by Eric Holmberg, I believe, is the audience will be able to see and decide for themselves whether it is true or not by examining the exhaustive, appalling yet compelling evidences, brought forth not only through coverage of numerous concerts and festivals, a systematic investigation of the impacts of music to one's worldview, personality, behavior, and actions, as well as the historical analysis to trace its root and links to the fathers of satanism, but also through personal interviews, not with psychiatrists or sociologists or philosophers or theologians, but with authoritative prominent popular artists who tell you their intentions of why they write and perform their style of musical lyrics. But Holmberg does not stop with the evidences then the verdict because throughout the presentation, he poured in Scripture verses, not only related to the total depravity of men and the wrath of God, but also the hope of the gospel. ""For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through Him might be saved."" I would rate this documentary PG-13, despite Holmberg's excellent work, due to its explicit content, and recommend everyone, 13-years-old and older to watch it.",1209340800,9,1926,5.094936708860759
2155488,5,B00030EOQI,"Many years ago, when I was in my mid-teen years, I made the decision to stop listening to mainstream rock music and to turn instead to Christian music. Until that time I had been listening to whatever was on the radio. I had quite a few tapes and had once had a whole collection of those old vinyl 45's. While I was usually not interested in music that was blatantly anti-God, I did listen to some that would surely have made my parents cringe had they heard it. But when I was fourteen or fifteen, my conscience began to accuse me about this music and I remember what was a near-religious experience for me, where I biked down to a local waterfall and, with no one else present, tossed some tapes over the edge in what was really a ceremony whereby I repented of that music. In the subsequent years, I bought Christian music and have since had little interest in mainstream music. Every now and then a song or a band catches my attention, but since I have so little willful exposure to it, this is quite rare. At the same time, I have kept abreast of what is happening in the music industry. Music saturates our culture, and it is difficult not to know what songs and artists are popular, for they are played on television, in commercials and are piped through malls, airports and any other public location. Needless to say, where the music of the 80's and 90's was bad, the music of our day is even worse. There has been a continual slide whereby the mainstream songs of our day are far worse than what was acceptable even ten or twenty years ago.

Many years ago, soon after I repented of my old music, I heard of a video called Hells Bells. Unfortunately, try as I might, I was never able to watch this video. I recently discovered that a sequel to this production was available and was able to secure a copy and study it this weekend. It is over six hours long, so this was no small undertaking. The DVD is produced by the same group that made Amazing Grace: The History and Theology of Calvinism which I reviewed here, and it is likewise hosted by Eric Holmberg. As with Amazing Grace, it is well-written, well-produced and theologically-sound. What I found especially impressive, is that while it is passionate about the subject matter, it avoids becoming what I feared it might - an obnoxious, uninformed tirade against the evils of anyone who likes to listen to music with a beat. It is alarming without begin alarmist.

It is important to note that because of the subject matter, this presentation contains disturbing material of a sexual and occultic nature and is inappropriate for younger viewers. At the beginning of the video, Holmberg warns that if you have no interest in or access to this type of music, you should probably not continue watching. But the bulk of the material, while it represents the worst of what the rock culture has to offer, is drawn largely from material that you might see on MTV or hear on your morning commute while listening to the radio. There are many places where details are blurred, film is censored and words are blanked out, but the heart of the horror remains in place.

While not explicitly stated, it seems that the presentation is targeted primarily at unbelievers, but secondarily at believers who have been drawn into this rock-n-roll culture. I would suggest that parents of teenaged children would do well to watch it as well. It kicks off with an introduction that provides the foundations for cultural analysis. Among the topics discussed is the philosophy of ""judge not,"" which dictates that we are wrong to question what others do, for morality is a personal matter. This is examined in light of what Jesus really meant when he warned against judgment. Having been assured that it is not only our right but even our responsibility to examine and judge something so revered as music, the presentation turns to this topic for the next six hours. Particular topics that the presentation covers in-depth are:

  * An Examination of the Power of Music
  * Music's Spiritual Connection
  * The Occult History of Rock
  * Rebellion, Nihilism and Death
  * Satanic Sex and Rock-n-Roll
  * Rock's Ultimate Rebellion
  * Music and Life at the Cross-Roads

Following these sections is a time of challenge and response, and finally some personal testimonies of God's grace and goodness in the lives of a few individuals. The clear purpose of the producers is to contrast Biblical morality and order, with the rock culture's immorality and chaos. Constant contrasts are made between the words of the Bible and the words of artists and listeners of rock music, between the heart of God and the blackened hearts of the rockers. We learn that the heart of rock-n-roll is rebellion, the sin that is at the heart of every sin, for Satan sinned by rebelling against God and the led humans in the same rebellion. When we sin against God, we make idols of ourselves, displaying the ""me-ism"" that is at the heart of rebellion. In one particularly noteworthy moment, the host asks many different teens to name three songs that promote sexual purity before marriage. Soon he was asking them for two, and then for one. No one could name a single song. While this is interesting, what is even more important is to ask ourselves why this question seems so absurd. It is absurd to ask about a rock song promoting purity or love for parents because such sentiments are antithetical to the very heart of rock music.

Another interesting observation was that the people at the heart of the music seem to understand what rock music is all about far more clearly than the kids who merely drink it all in. I am reminded of the latest series of American Idol where Gene Simmons (of KISS fame) was a guest judge. When confronted with a talented contestant who was a youth pastor, Simmons said to him, ""I think you're a country artist, and I(tm)ll tell you why. If you sing pop lyrics, you(tm)re going to have a problem with your ministry. Because rock and roll by definition -- and popular music -- is about sexuality. The rules are different for country. You can sing Christian oriented lyrics and be acceptable, and you can sell millions of records."" Time and again we see that the people who make and produce this music understand that it is, at heart, Satanic and in direct opposition to God. I was left wondering why it is that others cannot see this. And I came to realize that we cannot examine rock music without beginning with the foundation of the rebellion that is at its core.

One of the sections I found most shocking and convicting was the one dealing with the blasphemy that takes place when artists act out their rebellion and hatred towards God, and then thank him for their success or wear a cross around their neck. The video shows a montage of artists thanking God for their success (Backstreet Boys, N*Sync, Destiny's Child (who were dressed in very-nearly nothing), Sisqo (who subsequently thanked a thong for its part in his success)) and praying before their shows (Limp Bizkit, Christina Aguilera (immediately before performing the song ""Dirty"" which is true to its name)). I was forced to wrestle with the anger that must burn in God as he looks at these people acting out their hatred towards Him, and then ascribing this ""success"" to Him - to a God who is infinitely holy and infinitely pure, incapable of committing or condoning sin.

A further strength of the presentation is that its relevance is enhanced by the fact that it is only one year old. Watching the original Hells Bells may be interesting, but when the criticism goes no further than Van Halen and Lynrd Skynrd, it is easy to write it off as a dinosaur that has no bearing on our day. And while people who listen to this type of music may be able to avoid any association with the ultra-hard-core Satanic death-metal bands, the focus on the big names means that there will be some connection to each viewer. In this edition, there are literally hundreds of different artists that receive at least a passing mention, many of whom are still on the charts: Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Dave Mattews Band, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blink 180, Sarah McLachlan, MxPx, KISS, Incubus, (to name just a few) and any number of rappers and hip hop artists whose names meant very little to me.

If there is a place this presentation falters, I would suggest it is in the area of ""what next."" Having proven that much of the popular music of our day is absolutely unsuitable for consumption, the producers do not suggest next steps. I was left with questions such as: Can rock music be redeemed? Is it evil to its core, or is Christian rock music a suitable alternative? At the heart of these questions, is the deeper question of what makes evil music evil - the words, the music or the intent of the person who made it. I am sure it is for the best that Holmberg did not tell us to burn our CD collections and turn exclusively to classical music, but some guidance in moving forward would have been helpful, especially for those who were convicted of their need to remove themselves from this rock culture.

A consideration for me after watching this video was, How much is too much? How graphic is too graphic? I was forced to examine what I feel is given in a spirit of information, and what is just ""too much."" I concluded that generally the producers did a good job of knowing where to draw the line. By the very nature of the content, this video had to be graphic, and even shocking. For example, it is one thing to state that today's popular songs laud or laugh about every type of sin and debauchery - rape, bestiality, masturbation, homosexuality and every other type of deviant sex, but it becomes a reality in our minds when we see that the artists singing about these topics are considered ""family-friendly"" and may be playing in your son or daughter's stereo at this very moment. I remember many years ago my friends and I would sing Cyndi Lauper's song ""She Bop"" never knowing that it was a song about masturbation. Similarly, young children today are singing songs about topics that are far beyond their years, for Britney sings a song about masturbation and N*Sync sings one about cybersex. Many other artists sing about topics far worse. Some information will only reach us when it shocks us.

In summary, I found this presentation both convicting and biblical. The producers went to great lengths to be accurate and to do thorough analysis on the heart of music, rather than merely attacking the peripheral issues. The presentation continually turns to Scripture and ends with a theologically-sound time of response where people are invited to repent of their sin and turn to the Lord. Despite being graphic and discussing very dark subject matter, and with the same caveats as given by Holmberg at the beginning of the series, I recommend this presentation for both teens and parents. I am sure that this video can and will be used to reach many as God uses it to convict them of the evil heart of popular music.",1200960000,52,11041,4.641065028161802
2155489,5,B00030EOQI,"""Hell's Bells II"",
named for the famous song by the AC-DC band,
is an expose of popular music from a Christian perspective,
in particular, an American ""fundamentalist/evangelical""
Christian perspective.

It is a fascinating documentary
both for its content and its style
as film art.

I have watched it several times
and will probably watch it again.

The original Hell's Bells is also very good
and different enough that it is also worthy of viewing.
It is a bit dated as its focus is on the music
that was popular in the 1960's, 70's and 80's.

Both videos condemn certain types of music
as being objectively evil and attempt to make
the case from the biblical Christian perspective.
Nothing new there.
What is great about this video is the blend of imagery,
sound and commentary and historical and philosophical perspectives.
It is entertaining and interesting.

""Hell's Bells"" is primarily aimed at those
who are attached to the music that it critiques,
presenting ""something you need to know"" when making music choices.

To produce a 6.5 hour long documentary
that is never boring and holds up
to repeated viewings is no small feat.
This is Christian apologetic at its finest
and worth viewing regardless of personal belief.",1199923200,2,1229,4.970731707317073
2155490,5,B00030EOQI,"First of all this is very much an orthodoxy Christian world view on secular music. I first saw this when I was a brand new baby Christian. I already knew that many artist like ""The Doors"", ""AC/DC"", ""Kiss"", ""Led Zeplin"", etc. where all Satanic and I stopped listening to all those guys... and I loved them too. Music was and still is a center piece in my life.

After watching this video I stopped listening to secular music (voluntarily). Months later I listend to one of those ""good"" bands, one which I wouldn't have thought of as Satanic in the least bit. The Foo Fighters... they were my favorite of the bands still making music at the time. I cried after truly listening to the lyrics of their music. Many of their songs actually mock Christ!!! He also states how happy he is to be a member of Satan's followers in many of his songs... it's deep in the lyrics but easy to see with the mind of Christ. Needless to say, I never listened to them again (voluntarily).

Music stays with you and sticks with your spirit forever. You need to purge all the evil with you. Christ has nothing in common with Satan, so you shouldn't either. This video does define that line very well. If you don't believe the Bible is the inerrant word of God then you will not agree with this video... but it's still the most education video on music in America that I've ever heard of!

I'd recommend this for all peoples... but not all ages. The subject matter deals with the Spiritual, Social, Mental, Sexual, and Occultic connections of Western Secular Music. I personally wouldn't show this to anyone who isn't mature enough to talk about sexuality. The topics on the first disk are tame enough, but the second disk might as well have that written on the top. It's well censored, but not so much that you lose the idea of what's going on. There's a lot of shock in this too... for all you people who've yet to be jaded by the world... God bless you guys too.

If this video doesn't shock you, then you've personally served under satan willingly and can testify to the truth in the documentary.",1185408000,17,2076,4.455263157894737
2155491,5,B00030EOQI,"How many programs have you watched that truly changed your life? What a paradign shift! Watching this program made me feel like Neo (from The Matrix) taking the red pill and waking up from a fallen culture-induced coma. If you or a loved one are caught up in the ""sound and fury"" of pop music and popular culture, I can't recommend this series highly enough. Recently I heard of a camp in Georgia for trouble teens. They have every ""student"" watch this in its entirety upon admission. The founder of the school told my Dad that it is the single most powerful tool he has ever used to not only present the Gospel in a relevant and powerful way, but also to expose the dangers of popular culture.",1165795200,4,694,4.4296875
2155492,5,B00030EOQI,"This video, while not comprehensive, is a gritty video for a Christian Apologetics Ministry.  While some things are censored, there is no question as to the nature of the material being studied.  Of particular importance was how the presentation started out with the biblical basis for judging, in order to allay a popular miconception.  Especially noteworthy in this video is its presentation of the power of music from musicians and musicologists.  It will make you ask, with such questionable origins and messages, why as a Christian should we listen to it? The Beatles putting Alistar Crowley on their Sgt. Pepper's album caught me completely off-guard.  Highly Reccomended, but not for small children or those shocked by the depravity of man.",1152316800,4,747,5.191666666666666
2155493,5,B00030EOQI,"I saw the article in the New American magazine that interviewed Eric Holmberg and referenced (and raved) about this documentary.  Now I understand what all the fuss is about.  Balanced, thoughtful and incredibly well-researched, this is one of the finest documentaries on any subject I have ever seen.

And for those reviewers who have made fun of it -- or are using it for a drinking game (right!)-- I would have been just as cynical about it...until I was born-again and the lights were turned on.

2155494,3,B00030EOQI,"Thanks to the production team for a great laugh! While grasping at straws, nearly 200 different musical artists are deemed as part of a greater conspiracy: to make your kids pawns of Satan. The irony of the ""documentary"" is that it opened me up to even more bands that fell under the ""satanic"" label, and after I saw the original ""documentary"" in the early nineties, I was more intrigued than ever to give these bands a listen. Thank you Hell's Bells for opening me up to more music in my childhood!",1134518400,4,499,4.4945054945054945
2155495,5,B00030EOQI,"This video series like its predecessor Hells Bells 1 is another superior presentation that proofs beyond a doubt the incredible power that music has. It can be said that music is the language of languages, that out of all the arts there is none that more powerfully moves and changes the consciousness. Drawing its inspiration from the contemporary music scene and its artists, it is an expose that is both powerful and compelling to watch yet it does not resort to hysteria or sensationalism to make its point. The producers backed by ample evidence and years of research on the subject matter; put forth an overwhelming body of evidence that both skeptics and non-believers will find impossible to refute. Although many artists and musicians by their own admission admit to satanic and occultic influences in their music, many others deny it or ignore it and that's where this video series comes in. To unmask the hypocrisy and contradictions of these artists and the music industry as a whole. For many people this subject might have grown old or tiresome to hear and it brings up memories of record burning and bible thumping preachers out to condemn and cast everyone that does not agree with them to hell. But this series is the exact opposite of that. It is non preachy, it is against censorship of any kind, no one gets cast to hell, there is no record or cd burning for that matter and most important, it contains a compassionate message of hope and redemption for those that want to listen. Even for those that won't agree with its message, I guarantee that it will change the way you look at music and its artists forever. Fascinating to watch, you will not regret it.

HB2 is a powerful expose' of how nihilism has used the tool of music to present a worldview that stands in opposition to Biblical and historic Christianity.

8035692,4,B00030EOQI,"At 6 1/2 hours (DVD-R #1 at 3:52 and DVD-R #2 at 2:48 or so, not including two extras), it's both more enlightening/entertaining, and more eyeball punishing than the 1989 version.

Like the first HELL'S BELLS, the best way to understand the effect of this sledgehammer, um, documentary is to first watch Stanley Kubrick's gang trash nihilistic masterpiece A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and place yourself mentally as that Malmcolm McDowell character, strapped in a comfy straightjacket with eyes wired wide-open gleefully ready to get your brain loaded, washed, spun around the rinse cycle, and go along for the ride.

Most fun aspects of the movie/film here are the staged events, like the scrubbed and street-costumed kids being interviewed man-on-the-street style, the illuminati-scheming university professors (this book, section 4, about 1:41 into DVD-R #1&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flesh-of-the-Gods-The-Ritual-Use-of-Hallucinogens/dp/0881334774/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flesh of the Gods: The Ritual Use of Hallucinogens</a>) scene (--hmmm...shades of Matthew Paul Turner's books?  I saw the same kinda stageshow when the fundies infested my college campus and thrilled everyone with the street theater in the early '80s ""winning"" arguments with their own posing as local student hecklers) plotting to corrupt students with pagan signs and influences (I recall taking my music appreciation class in my freshman year, being indoctrinated with Bach and asking the prof innocently why it seemed that classical composers in the 17th and 18th centuries seemed to be primarily retained to churn out violin muzak for the nobles' dinner parties), the faux rock star Charles Monroe insulting Buddhists by smashing dolls on stage, and ""Kurt Louder"" of MTTV spoofing M(oron)TV--quite effectively, I might add.  On an interesting political note, the vid features two appearances by the Dixie Chicks, which suggests that the March, 2003 anti-Bush outburst (the end date of this HELL'S BELLS 2 info runs out about June) was politically inspired by Reel To Real's affinity for John Birch Society opinions (the video earned a promotional writeup in the JBS mag, THE NEW AMERICAN).

At the one hour mark on DVD-R #1 (1:00:53) there's a funny presentation about Edmonton, Alberta Canada using classical music as teenager shoplifting repellent.  The presentation has one statistical gaff:  the assertion that the program led to a crime drop of 800%, which is a mathematical impossibility (800% is eight times the whole of 100%; it's akin to stating ""He fell 800 feet off the 100 foot high cliff to his death..."").  Numerous other places, even locally in my stomping grounds (downtown Nordstroms!) have caught onto the fact that the Great Unwashed cannot endure music without a metronome time signature.  (I've caught on to the same phenomena some years ago using avante-guard classical, improv bebop jazz, and ESPECIALLY opera to annoy ""beer & hotdog crowd"" and pesky bluehairs from the office area.)

Like the 1989 version, lots and lots of Anton LaVey and Aleister Crowley.  And LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of MTV music vid clips of what seems were the late night hard stuff when M(oron)TV really swam for the septic tank, interspersed with lots of quotes from ROLLING STONE tabloid-racked rag, and some of SPIN.  Date on the material runs maybe 1996+, running out about mid-2003.

Yeah, I'd say the picture makes a solid case about the axis of eeevil, the war pact of MTV and Rolling Stone on circumstantial grounds, but the presentation, which proves by such means that MTV/Rolling Stone is some pretty vile stuff, doesn't answer a basic question:  are acts like Insane Clown Posse and Marilyn Manson religiously committed to a cause/master, or are all the grandstanding and slimey quality theatrics just a working marketing ploy?  The onus of the arguments centers on the act(or)s, but avoids the corptocracy offices.

HELL'S BELLS 2 still has two of the not-quite legitimate academic ""experts"" in the critic documentary section about 40 minutes in, the David Tame book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-Power-of-Music-The-Transformation-of-Self-and-Society-through-Musical-Energy/dp/0892810564/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy</a>&nbsp;extolling Madame Blavatsky's intercontinental telepathy with long-dead historical and fictional persons&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sounds-of-American-Doomsday-Cults-Vol-14-The-Church-Universal-and-Triumphant-Inc-feat-Elizabeth-Clare-Prophet/dp/B006UJD4ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sounds of American Doomsday Cults, Vol. 14: The Church Universal and Triumphant, Inc. feat.

All of the sources puffed as legitimate academics are far more pop writers than the presentation suggests.  Missing this time vs. the 1989 edition are the rock-music-kills-plants allegations, the backmasking hoax from 1982, and Bob Larson's rock-music-boils-eggs whopper.

Recommended!.

Format:  This set came in a 2-DVD slimline case, full color cardstock professional cover art, but this film is copied to two silver generic DVD-Rs --those DVD-R copy blanks you can buy at $20 for a 50-stack for your computer/laptop-- with the ""label"" sides of the disc ink printed amateurishly.  I noticed the printing quality on the ""label"" side from an ink printer (?), put a drop of lighter fluid on the printing (the stuff is useful to remove the ""sticky"" from price stickers, like those strips on new CDs at the top spine), and the ink started to run a bit.  Playing surface is DVD-R deep purple, not a manufactured DVD.  My second DVD-R has one slight ""sticky"" spot on the playback on the main presentation.  The 2nd disc has two extras; the second extra is a 2:32 cutout of the VHS presentation featuring an art-pop lefty group, Caeser Pink and the Imperial Orgy.
