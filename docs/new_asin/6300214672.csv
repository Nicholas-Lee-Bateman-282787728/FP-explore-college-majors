256062,3,6300214672,One of the few 80's horror movies made for girls.  The movie is soft on gore.  Think SPIRIT Halloween store props.  Yup - that's as good as it gets.  Again- made for girls because most other 80's horror flicks were geared towards younger men at the time.

256140,4,6300214672,"Before the likes of ""Scream"" and ""Cabin In The Woods"" turned slasher movie tropes on their heads, ""April Fool's Day"" -- a trojan horse of sorts -- did just that, all while operating in a vein similar to the popular holiday-themed stalk n' slash flicks of the era like ""My Bloody Valentine"" and ""New Year's Evil.""

Rich and slightly aloof Muffy (Deborah Foreman) invites a group of her friends to her private island for a weekend of good times. Incidentally, they also arrive on April Fool's Day, which means the line between goofing around and getting gutted is more than a little blurred, as a series of pranks turns into a deadly game of survival, with a little who-dunnit thrown in for good measure.

Produced by Frank Mancuso Jr. -- who helped birth many of the ""Friday The 13th"" sequels -- ""April Fool's Day"" shares a bit of DNA with similar films of its era. But whereas the average slasher flick of the time opted for gore over story or tension, ""April Fool's Day"" keeps most of its violence off-screen and/or implied, giving the film its own look and feel. At times, it gives off a slight Hitchcock-ian vibe that suits it just fine. Among the cast, genre fans will be pleased to find Amy Steel of ""Friday The 13th Pt. 2"" fame as well as the indispensable Thomas F. Wilson (Biff from the ""Back To The Future"" films) leading the unusually likeable group of victims. While ""April Fool's Day"" appears to be all-too familiar on the surface, it really is a unique experience unto itself. Don't be fooled by its somewhat tricky presentation; this one is a real treat indeed.",1447372800,,1575,4.601423487544484

It's a slasher flick but as you probably inferred from the title it has a twist, which I won't divulge here.

The movie is well directed and well acted and will keep you entertained up to the end.  Highly recommend this movie.  But be sure to get the 80s version.  The remake wasn't that great.",1433808000,,488,3.9690721649484537

256177,4,6300214672,"A Group of college friends gather for a weekend on a remote island by their friend, Muffy St. John. It's a loaded prankster's paradise from day one. All seem to have a few laughs until the first night, when one by one, they begin to vanish without the others knowing why. Well, the title says it all in this one from 1986. Deborah Foreman (Valley Girl, My Chauffer) plays Hostess to the preppy and deprived coeds. In each room the guests stay in, there are items left in drawers, closets, etc. for the ""friends"" to find and think about. Perhaps it could be some things from their own past?
This movie really is not scary, but a little suspenseful. There is a little blood, but hardly worthy of today's standards. I thought the storyline was a good one, unique for the times when during the '80s we saw pretty much everything under the sun in horror movies. They included using dates or holidays, graduations, final exams, forest camps, proms, initiations, sleepovers, you name it.

All in all, a gem from the decade of ""splatter"" or what I like to call horror mayhem that really started the sequels in movies.

256296,4,6300214672,"I was born in the 80s, so I did not see this movie when it was actually released.  In fact, I JUST saw this a few days ago for the first time ever.  I love horror movies, and being a denizen of the 21st century, I usually like scary movies that are very creepy, very shocking and full of lots of ""jump"" moments.  Yeah, this movie doesn't really have much of any of that. :-)  But in spite of this, I really really enjoyed it and would actually own it if I didn't have free access to thru Amazon!

The plot:  Muffy St. John (best name EVER; who thought of that??) is a popular, pretty college kid who decides to throw a party over an April Fools Day weekend.  Muffy is also super rich, so she throws it in her family's summer home on their private island.  She invites several other college kids.  They all know Muffy, but not neccessarily each other.  You've seen college and high school 80s movies before, so you know the fashions and the hi-jinks to expect.  What I did NOT expect, however, was how much I actually liked the characters and their interactions with each other.  The actors were very good, and there were some really funny lines in this movie!  STILL hilarious, decades later.  I liked the characters so much, I regretted seeing them start to go when the body count begins to rise.  :-)

Though not outright scary, I thought the movie was suspenseful, and there is definitely brief gore and blood. I also jumped a couple of times.  This was kind of like an Agatha Christie ""And Then There Were None"" style of mystery in which a group of people are basically stuck somewhere (there is no ferry to the mainland until after the weekend, naturally!) and a killer keeps knocking people off one by one.  Though at first no one's sure who the killer is, they eventually single out one person as their #1 suspect:  Miss Muffers, slowly turning from an elegant and well-put-together hostess into a disheveled and creepy mess.  You have to wait until the end to find out if they're right!

All in all, a fun, non-gory, non-explicit slasher flick.  Contains some foul language, a little bit of brief gore, explicit (but funny!) sex talk and one very brief (but funny!) sex act.  No nudity.

SPOILER ALERT!!!  Do NOT read past this if you DON'T want to know the ending!!!!
Another reason I enjoyed this movie was the surprise ending.  Though I initially thought it was kind of wimping out (sort of like, ""And then it was all a dream.  The End!""), but it seemed appropriate for the overall tone of the movie. Furthermore, it makes this movie very memorable as that super rare slasher film with a 100% happy ending!  Most slashers end tragically, a handful end hopefully for one or two characters, but this one ends super happy for everyone involved!  Yay!  :-)  How rare is that??",1388361600,,2783,4.49500998003992

256341,3,6300214672,"Muffy St. John invites a group of college friends over to her parents isolated island for fun and games. Unfortunately bodies start popping up and they find out it's another ""Ten Little Indians"" all over again. Can they solve the mystery and end up with a happier ending than the Christie story?

Frank Mancuso, Jr. (Friday the 13th 2, 3, 4, 5, Stigmata) was the producer of this little gem so we should know right off he knows how to work a slasher. Fred Walton was the director (When a Stranger Calls, When a Stranger Calls Back) so we hope there's going to be some good suspense.

 The movie begins with the ride over to the island using the ferry. We get a feel of the characters enough to know they are basically the stereotypical type characters. It's kind of obvious who will be sleeping with who, which will keep to themselves as the shy loner types, and which will die....or is it??? This movie thankfully pulls a few punches of its own and makes the deaths a little unpredictable...sometimes.

 Action starts right off with a tragic accident on the boat - a rather gory and painful incident where a man is ran over and loses an eye. A character, Skip, has the most trouble getting over this disaster but the others soon lose themselves in the spirits of the weekend. They take turns playing tricks on each other, and sometimes the jokes can get a little cruel. Throughout the movie you're wondering if it's just another nasty trick skimming the surface, or the blade of the killer.

 This movie has several twists and ends up being a fun horror-mystery with a high body count, a decent splashing of blood, some built-up tension, an original script, tight pacing, great acting and an unforgettable ending. Paranoia in movies always works and the fingers definitely start pointing here and there as more of their friends turn up missing or dead.

 Amy Steel from Friday the 13th appears as a big role; I love this gal and would have liked to see more of her in horror. She's a strong character and has good material to work with. Muffy (Deborah Foreman - Waxwork) is stunning. She's also a major character and while Amy is light haired and fun, Muffy's brunette and moody. When they get to the island, fun and airy Muffy turns into some weird former self. She begins walking around in her housecoat, not brushing her hair, and acting twisted. Later on hints are dropped about this plot leading us to believe some really far-fetched scenarios involving her. All the rest acted well - Jay, Nikki (Deborah Goodrich), Chazz (Clayton Rohner), Rob (Ken Olandt), and a really serious quiet type of girl.

 We don't get to see graphic death details but a lot of after effects. Many of the killings resemble Jason kills in that we see a quick glimpse of the weapon going for the throat and the characters reaction. One particular scene where a body comes up is when two are making out on the floor of the boathouse and a corpse floats by underneath them. Some nice blood and gore involved.

 This movie was intriguing from the start but the ending, while original and not expected, was pretty...different. I wasn't let down but a lot of people were. For one thing if horror has a good enough plot I'm satisfied without the worst having to come true. The wrap up seemed to be ideal for the rest of the flick's theme and I turned off the tube feeling overall happy.

 Some things that didn't work were that I would have enjoyed seeing more involved with the April's Fools' Day pranks. Get to know the characters a bit more (although they are explored well), especially the brainy blonde girl's whole story deal. Did Muffy know the reason the tape recorder would affect her that badly or was it just sheer bad luck on her part?

 There's a pretty good chance you won't see this ending coming. For some good kills, a fun cast, and any slasher fan -- check this one out.",1379635200,,3864,4.552669552669553

256393,4,6300214672,"I'm feeling pretty privileged to watch April Fool's Day in HD.
Considering it isn't on blu-ray yet and cable rarely airs it, this is it for me.
I remember being a little kid in the video rental store and wanting to rent it on VHS so bad but never could because I wasn't old enough and I eventually just forgot about it.

Then, as I was wandering through Amazon under the influence of nostalgia, looking up various 80's movies I came across it on Instant video in HD. I couldn't pass it up. I have to say the HD quality is quite good for a catalog title going 26 years strong. I was very impressed with the depth, clarity and strong colors for a film its age. Sure, there are some minor inconsistencies here and there but somebody took good care of this film and it shows. As far as 80's quasi-teen slasher films go, this one is perhaps one of THE most underrated and unappreciated for its unique spin on the genre. Has anybody ever referred to it as ""Clue on Camp Crystal""? Because that's ~kind of the feeling~ I got from it.

If you have a soft spot in your movie loving heart for 80's films that fall into or frolic around this genre, go ahead and give it a look, it'll probably be one the few times you'll enjoy being made to feel like a fool.
Also, if/when this movie is finally put on blu-ray, I can't wait to see what kind of extras are included.

The plot is quite simple. A group of eight college friends (each more annoying than the next) gather together at an island mansion belonging to heiress Muffy St. John to celebrate their final year of school. They soon discover that each has a hidden secret from their past which is revealed, and soon after, they turn up dead. Yet, are they really dead?

256447,5,6300214672,"First off, it should best be said that the filmmakers did this film a giant disservice with the front cover movie art, being that it makes this sleeper hit come across as just another run of the mill cheesy slasher flick that most people just ended up ignoring. That being said, I was greatly surprised by how creative, well written, well acted, and well paced this film was. For all those who got tired of seeing the same lame movie roles and characters from all those Friday The 13th type slasher flicks, what April Fool's Day does differently is offer up what is presented on the surface as something that might be similar, but more intelligent movie fans will notice something different about this film. First off, the cast comprising of mostly 80's B-movie stars puts on excellent performances as a gang of college seniors taking a trip to a friend's lake house (Deborah Goodrich and Clayton Rohner of 1985's 'Just One of the Guys' and Thomas F. Wilson who played Biff in the Back to the Future films). At this lake house they will find themselves being conned into April Fool's jokes that seem to grow more disturbing as time goes on. Eventually they begin being killed off one by one. Fans will also notice that while this may seem as it will come off as a cheesy flick, it actually is not cheesy at all, but does take itself rather seriously. Characters have their own personal life issues and dilemmas to deal with, but are also for the most part very likable as people. This helps the characterization greatly. Even the ""bad boy"" types don't get on your nerves, because they don't take themselves too over the top - no obnoxious sex (although there is one sex scene which is sort of purposefully laughable), no drunken meathead jerk personalities, no snotty spoiled bratty girls. Dialogue is very real and interestingly written as well.

The film then becomes a whodunit flick where the killer is left mysterious and those who die, die, and those who survive need to figure out the mystery of the house's hostess and what her connection may be with the killings. This all culminates to a very surprising plot twist of an ending that is perhaps one of the most creative plots twists I've ever seen in a movie, and should be placed right up with those such as The Sixth Sense and The Untouchables. The idea for how this comes about goes with the movie's theme and is nothing short to me than genius. While this film is still kept at a slasher flick ""level,"" it begins to take itself more seriously as a movie, which is a good thing. You can tell the filmmakers were trying to genuinely make something refreshingly good, and they succeeded. The movie is fairly bloody but not to a tacky level; it makes sure to keep things to just the level they should be, and does not try to show off itself with over the top killings or ridiculous music. It doesn't need to, the writing and stellar acting holds it own for the entire duration.

In total, I would say to seriously check this one out, it is a sleeper hit not many have seen or heard of, but definitely deserves to be seen. While at the surface level it does come across as another cheese B-movie 80's slasher flick, this film actually on a deeper level has much more to offer.",1295740800,,3234,4.526495726495726

I popped it in last night, expecting some cheesy, low-grade 80's gore.  Too smug to be scared, I watched the movie, thinking I had the whole thing figured out, only to be delightfully surprised by the ending.  In fact, the ending was such a surprise, I was a little turned off (""How unlikely is THAT!"" I wondered aloud), only to have my doubts dispelled by what would normally be an annoying ""killer explains all"" moment at the end.

The story follows a group of young college kids who are invited for a Spring Break type weekend at a remote island mansion by their wealthy friend, Muffy St. John (the name, believe it or not, is not one of the movie's many pranks).  The ferry ride over is punctuated by a horribly violent event that foreshadows the gruesome events to come.  After the guests settle into their prank-ridden rooms (and one couple demonstrates the oddest sexual position I've ever seen), bodies start piling up, the hostess begins to act odder and odder, and the local sherrif begins dropping hints that the guests are in more danger than they thought.

256477,4,6300214672,"The great slasher frenzy of the 1980's was winding down when ""April Fool's Day"" was released in 1986.  This gem was produced by Frank Mancuso, Jr., who brought us ""Friday 13th Parts III through V.""  Though the critics, and many fans, reviled it, I thought it was an ingenious piece of film making.

  In the vein of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians,"" a group of people - in this case, hormonally charged college preppies - are invited for a weekend on a secluded island.  It is April Fool's Day and everyone must endure tasteless, immature jokes, including whoopee cushions, exploding cigars, collapsing chairs, and dribble glasses.  Unfortunately, there is a maniac in their midst who begins dispatching the guests in various means that are not funny.

  The murders are done off screen and the killer's identity remains a mystery until the end.  Could it be the ferryman who was injured in a freak accident, eccentric (perhaps deranged) Muffy, the constable, or one of the guests, pretending to be dead?  As it was with ""Ten Little Indians,"" red herrings and dark secrets abound in this thrill fest.

  The feisty, tom-boyish Amy Steel (""Friday the 13th Part II"") leads an ensemble cast of talented young actors.  Steel is Kit, the heroine of ""April Fool's Day,"" who scrambles to learn the identity of the killer.  Meanwhile, the corpses of her friends begin to pile up.  This is one holiday she will never forget.

  ""April Fool's Day"" is a giallo-like film recommended for anyone who collects good holiday slasher fare such as ""Black Christmas,"" ""Halloween,"" and ""My Bloody Valentine.""

I do like this movie, but will be the first to admit that without the nostalgia factor (saw this as a young'un in the theater), it can be kind of a slog to get through.

Like so many other 80's slasher films, ""April Fool's Day"" gathers a group of hyper-sexed kids in a remote location, and before long an unseen killer begins picking them off one by one. With ""April Fool's Day"" we see a group of college friends gathering on the remote island mansion of Buffy St. John to celebrate Spring Break. We get the usual assortment of 80's clich characters; the bad girl that's looking to hook up, the jock, the nerdy camera guy, the loving couple, etc. Tragedy strikes on the way to the island, and when the sheriff and the local ferry operator rush back to the mainland, the kids are left without a way to get off the island. As the guests settle in, the begin to find odd things in their bedrooms; newspaper clippings about deadly accidents, bondage gear and an upsetting audio cassette. Before long, the guest begin to disappear as a mysterious figure seems to be hunting them down.

Be wary of reading too many reviews as they may contain spoilers about the movie as it does take some nice twists. I think the biggest issue I had with the film is it's slow pace. It takes a good 45 minutes for the killer to appear, so we're stuck with these characters jabbering on for most of the film. And while the filmmakers do take a stab at developing the characters to a small degree, they are basically as interesting as any collection of ""Friday the 13th"" fodder, which is to say, not worth spending 45 minutes with. Actually the whole film feels like a watered down ""Friday the 13th"" entry, one without Jason to look forward to. The last 15-20 minutes of this film are pretty solid, and they do manage to build up some suspense in the last act (thanks mostly to Amy Steel), but I'm not sure that's enough to recommend sitting through the first half?",1143417600,,2065,4.445910290237467

IFC has really been pulling the obscure ones out of the closet for the last couple of months, and I can't thank them enough. I'd even forgotten I went to see this opening weekend. Twenty years later, I didn't remember a thing about it. Which tells me something.

You've got the usual setup-- group of kids goes to big, deserted island for a vacation that will include much partying, carnal interest, all that sort of thing. On the way out, however, a horrid boat accident dampens the mood somewhat. And when guests start to go missing, well... it's a mid-eighties slasher flick, what do you want?

The thing that separates April Fool's Day from the wash of other slasher flicks common at the time is that the end just ain't at all what you think it's gonna be. (And you'll kick yourself for not seeing it earlier.) All the usual slasher-flick conventions are here, but Walton (who, after being responsible for When a Stranger Calls-- the first twenty minutes of which should be used as a textbook on how to build suspense in film-- spent most of the rest of his career directing TV movies) never takes it too seriously; it never quite gets to the level of spoof seen in Pandemonium or Student Bodies, but this is a film where you can be pretty sure you're laughing with the director, not at him. Couple this with a cast of bright young things, most of whom have gone onto respectable character-actor roles (remember that most slasher-flick victims have no career whatsoever after they get offed in interesting ways), and you've got yourself a turn-your-brain-off good time. Classic cinema it's not, but it's fun, in a goofy sort of way. ** ",1126483200,2,1678,4.658783783783784

The minimal storyline involves a group of people and some April Fool's pranks gone awry that result in bodies piling up.  What seperates April Fool's Day from the horde of lame 80's slashers is the dynamite twist, which you probably will see coming anyway.  That aside, there is little to no gore here, which was a welcome feature considering the time that this film was made.  The acting isn't anything to write home about, but then again is acting in a slasher movie ever something to take into consideration.

The horror scenes look like high school kids did them.  The ending is a big April fools joke, that really caps off this lame effort.  Maybe the movie is trying to be clever, or make fun of this silly genre, but it isn't entertaining at all.  Although the film is well produced it has little to recommend it.

Playful twist on the standard slasher movie (produced by Frank Mancuso, Jr., who was involved with several of the ""Friday the 13th"" sequels) with a disarming sense of humor.  Many viewers may know what they're in for judging by the title alone, and be able to appreciate it knowing that it's not taking itself seriously.

That said, though, there are scenes of genuine suspense, light-hearted performances (the whole pictures's all in fun), and a noticeable de-emphasis on graphic gore.

Not a truly great picture but enjoyable just the same.

Just another bare-bones DVD from Paramount, however, with not even a theatrical trailer.

Muffy St. John (played by Deborah Foreman) invites a large group of college students to her mansion for a weekend party.  Many of the students are surprised and suspicious about the invitation, for they do not like Muffy and do not understand such a selfless deed.  Fun and games (which mainly consists of reading poetry and playing practical jokes) turns to terror when a killer prowls the mansion and starts knocking off the teens one by one.
Director Fred Walton uses a funny, yet haunting script to create a slasher film with a twist.  Nothing too special, for it stills holds very true with the genre, ""April Fool's Day"" will greatly satisfy fans of a film that combines humor and violence, while others purely dedicated to the slice-and-dice theme might be turned off.

256555,4,6300214672,"I'm willing to bet you've put this film off for years.  I'm sure you've seen it at the video store numerous times throughout the years, and you may have been intrigued by the cover with the chick holding the knife behind her back with her hair in a noose.  Well, it may not be worth all those years of putting it off, but you'd might as well take that plunge now that the film is out on dvd.  Ya know, this movie is actually pretty good considering it's a slasher flick.  Slasher flicks aren't exactly the mark of quality, but this one has some decent performances and a good script that actually conjures up a few scares.  Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't gonna keep you up all night or anything, but with a formulatic genre like this, April Fool's Day manages to be kinda spooky.  And it's actually funny too!  Alot of slasher flicks can't quite pull off the humor thing, but this movie actually manages to be laugh out loud funny.  The humor and scares can be put down to some very good performances by the young cast.  Most slasher flicks have acting that leaves much to be desired, but I'd have to say this movie has the best acting of any slasher flick I've seen(and I've seen many).  The ending of this film gets mixed opinions.  Some people see it as a letdown, while others find it quite original.  I'm in the latter category, but it's one of those endings that's only gonna work once.  Similar to Primal Fear or The Sixth Sense, the twist is good for the first viewing only, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy watching it again.

256556,4,6300214672,"""April Fool's Day"" is yet another one of those holiday themed slasher films that emerged in the wake of the ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" successes. You know all about them if you follow the genre in any substantive way--movies with names like ""Mother's Day,"" ""Graduation Day,"" ""My Bloody Valentine,"" and ""Silent Night, Deadly Night."" O.K., the last two don't specifically refer to dates, but it doesn't take a genius to infer that the two films play on Valentine's Day and Christmas. The slasher genre never died out thanks in large part to the billion plus sequels in the ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" franchises, but their poorer cousins did fade into obscurity until DVD resurrected them. All I can say about that is thank goodness! I'm the first to admit that some of these films fail to rise above mediocrity, but several of them are quite good. ""April Fool's Day"" definitely falls into the latter category. The film doesn't contain a lot of gore we stalk and slash lovers have come to know and love, but the central plot of the film and its amazing twist ending makes the movie well worth watching. There is no other way to say it--""April Fool's Day"" is actually a spoof of the entire slasher phenomena, and it spoofs the genre years before ""Scream"" appeared on the scene.
What makes ""April Fool's Day"" so different from the other slasher films? You won't notice anything amiss for most of the film. The plot is quite basic: a gang of college students accepts an invitation from a rich classmate to spend a few days at her opulent house on a remote island. The girl inviting all of her friends, Muffy Saint John (great name, eh?), is a bit of an oddball. She's rich, though, so all of her pals don't hesitate to accept the invite. Besides, who wouldn't like to spend some time rambling around a huge house out in the sticks? It could be fun. Trouble rears its ugly head from the start. An accident on the ferry trip out to the house, the result of a prank gone horribly wrong, seriously injures a local and causes some heavy guilt amongst Saint John's guests. The tension never lets down once the group arrives at the house, as Muffy shrewdly installed a series of April Fool's type gags in the various rooms of her guests. Even worse, subplots in the main story reveal relationship problems and uncertainties about the future among several of the visitors. The whole vacation teeters on the edge of total disaster before plunging into an abyss of murder, mayhem, and sheer insanity.
The next morning after the young adults arrive something sinister happens to Muffy. She appears to assume an entirely different personality by changing her dress, her mannerisms, and her relations with the guests. As if that's not bad enough, some of the youths start to disappear. It becomes obvious very quickly that a killer is on the loose in the house and on the grounds. No one is safe from this crazed wacko, not any of Muffy's friends or any of the locals unfortunate enough to venture onto the property. As people disappear one by one, two of the guests begin to uncover the madness behind Muffy Saint John's house and her private life. The picture isn't pretty; it appears that Muffy had a twin who went stark raving mad as a child, and now BUFFY Saint John has returned to wreak bloody havoc on her sister and her friends. It could very well end up that no one will escape the wrath of this warped sibling. As the surviving pair attempts to get away from the house, they finally come face to face with Muffy's alter ego in a conclusion that is sure to get your goat. Perhaps you will be one of those astute viewers who saw it all coming before it happened, but I didn't. Then again, I'm one of those sheep who blithely accepts nearly everything I see on the screen at face value. I did not see this ending coming at all, which is ridiculous considering the title of the film.
""April Fool's Day"" is a fun movie even if you don't enjoy watching horror movies. The gore is mostly non-existent, the characters are lots of fun, and the conclusion will have you hitting yourself upside the head in ""Gee, ain't I stupid"" glee. I liked most of the actors, especially the always beautiful and enjoyable Deborah Foreman in the role of Muffy Saint John. Foreman has a real girl next door quality that I find irresistible. The movie plays on that quality to deliver a few shocks towards the end of the film as her character threatens her surviving guests. The look on her face--a look of cold, detached murder--was downright chilling to watch. The other actors and actresses did a good job as well. Look for Griffin O'Neal playing a troubled young man (what a stretch there!), Thomas F. Wilson as the group cut up (he played Biff in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy), and B movie fave Ken Olandt as one of the survivors who battles Saint John in the end (he starred opposite Jennifer Aniston in the first ""Leprechaun"" film).
The only problem I had with the movie was the DVD version. The extras are non-existent. Too bad considering the price of the disc, but the film has such a neat ending it hardly mattered. I remember when this one came out and unfortunately I was not old enough to see it (and still hesitant to attempt a sneak in at the theater). At least the DVD gives us a nice widescreen picture transfer with good audio. Give this one a shot if you love slasher flicks. You'll like it!",1080086400,29,5394,4.556127703398558
256557,4,6300214672,"Another teen horror film whose creators hoped to garner a few drops from the lucrative post-HALLOWEEN slasher-flick fount of the 1980s, APRIL FOOL'S DAY is surprisingly a cut above many of its contemporaries.  The film contains relatively little graphic gore, no actual nudity, and some pretty good actors, thereby going against the cookie-cutter recipe and, instead, concentrating on the development of likable characters, eerie atmosphere, and some genuinely effective spook-show scares.
The plot unfolds at a sequestered island estate, familial home to wealthy college student Muffy St. John. Having the big house to herself the weekend of April 1st, Muffy has invited some of her fellow ivy-league students to spend a few days partying with her. Get a bunch of college kids together on April Fool's Day and, of course, the practical jokes abound.  But this is a slasher flick, remember, so it isn't too long until the kiddos start turning up dead.  But who's responsible for the bloodshed?  Hostess Muffy?  The boatman who ferried the group over to the island?  One of Muffy's remaining guests?  Or is there some other secret hiding behind the doors of the old family mansion?
APRIL FOOL'S DAY offers a successful combination of mystery, horror, and humor, and the talented young cast delivers both the suspense and the laughs without taking it too far over the top.  The film's subtle scares and toned-down gore make it more akin to older psychological spook films like THE HAUNTING (1963) and THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE (1973) than to typical slasher fare, and this, combined with the good writing and good acting, make it stand out above many of the other teen horror flicks of the 1980s.  Admittedly, the twist ending might be a letdown for some horror fans, and those gore hounds who watch slasher flicks solely for the blood and guts will probably find the entire film too tame.  But true horror aficionados who enjoy the entire range and history of the genre should at least give APRIL FOOL'S DAY a once-over.
Avid filmgoers will enjoy seeing the film's familiar faces from the 1980s and 1990s.  Deborah Foreman, who plays Muffy, is probably best known for her roles in comedies like 1983's VALLEY GIRL, 1985's REAL GENIUS, and 1986's MY CHAUFFER.  Film fans will no doubt recognize Clayton Rohner from his appearance in the comedy JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (1985), as well as from genre films such as THE RELIC (1997) and SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK...FOR MORE (1999).  Hardcore genre fans will be delighted to see Amy Steel, known for her appearances in some of the FRIDAY THE 13th films, and SF fans will get a kick out of spotting Thomas F. Wilson, who is probably better known as bully Biff Tannen in the BACK TO THE FUTURE film series.
As with many DVDs from Paramount, the disc is short on extras.  However, it offers a beautifully crisp and clean digital transfer in anamorphic widescreen at the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  And at the very reasonable amazon.com price, horror fans can easily afford to add this one to their growing DVD collections.",1075161600,12,3070,4.876923076923077

256560,3,6300214672,"Finding an inexpensive copy of this DVD in the Amazon Market Place, I figured 'What the heck?' and picked it up.  The movie begins with a familiar theme, a group of college kids on their way to an isolated location (queue foreboding music).  Apparently this group was assembled by a common friend to spend the weekend at spacious house on an island whose only access is by ferry, which only runs during the week, so they are basically stuck there until Monday.  Through the use of a video camera, we are introduced to the various guests and they seem like your typical group for an 80's horror movie.
After an eventful trip on the Ferry of Death, they arrive on the Island of Death, and are greeted by their Hostess of Death (sorry, I'll cut it out), Muffy St. John, played by Deborah Foreman, probably most recognizable as Julie from the 1983 movie Valley Girl.  Muffy leads them to the secluded house, which is more like a mansion, and we find out that this house will be part of her inheritance when she turns 21.  After a number of practical jokes, which Muffy set up, every turns in for the night, except for Skip, Muffy's cousin, who is still upset about an unpleasant event that happened on the ferry.  Alone and visible drunk, he wanders down by the boathouse, ventures inside, and, as you can guess, the murderin' begins.
The next morning no one really seems to miss Skip (I know I didn't, as I thought he was kind of annoying), and a couple breaks off from the rest of the group and proceeds to go down by the boathouse to screw around.  Their horizontal tango is cut short as the girl catches a glimpse of Skip's body floating under the boathouse, which, I guess, killed the mood as the couple goes running back to the house in a panic.  Relating what happened, the dead body part, not the sex part, to the rest of the group, they think maybe Skip is pulling a prank, so a few of the guys go off searching for him in the woods around the house.  This leads to another murder or two, which spoils the festivities altogehter.
After a few more murders, and a couple of revelations, the movie finally spills its' proverbial guts, and what appeared to be your typical slasher type movie shows itself as something else.  Actually, I sort of caught on about halfway through.  I'm no mental goliath, no Sherlockian powers of deduction here, but the clues were there, and I didn't have to strain too hard to get in on the 'know'.  There were some pretty large plot holes, certain elements that didn't jibe, but it didn't ruin the movie.  There was some suspense, but I was never really on the edge of my seat.  Overall, a fun movie, but probably wouldn't hold up too well to repeated viewing.  Nice wide screen presentation with good audio, but no extras.
Oh yeah, watch for the character of Rob near the end as he gets locked in a pantry closet and nearly starts crying and stuff as his girlfriend is being chased around the house and terrorized.  As flimsy as that door was, I could have been out of there in like a minute with a kick or two.  Heck, my old granny could have gotten out of there with relative ease.

With more brains than your average teen slasher ""April Fools Day"" is about a group of college kids spending a weekend at their friends house (the wonderfully named Muffy!!)on a remote island. What starts out with the kids playing practical jokes on each other soon turns sinister as the friends start disapearing one by one. While not strictly a slasher (there is very little gore) it is a great little whodunnit which is a bit tongue in cheek.

256598,5,6300214672,"When the trailers first came out for April Fools Day, they were accompanied by the song ""Momma Told Me Not To Come"" by Three Dog Night.  I wasn't sure if it was a slasher movie, a comedy, a comedy-slasher movie, or even a frat-party movie.  All I knew for sure was that Deborah Foreman (Valley Girl)was in it and in the mid-80's I thought she was so hot you could have cast her in a high school driving safety video and I would have paid admission.
Foreman plays Muffy, a rich college kid who invites a bunch of friends to a secluded island owned by her family for a weekend (an April Fools weekend) of fun and pranks.  The island is only reachable by ferry and this is the last ferry until monday.  An accident happens and the kids are shaken.
Here is where the mind games start.  Not many of the young people know each other.  All are supposedly friends of Muffy, but most of them don't know each other directly.  April fools pranks are played non-stop.  Dribble glasses, collapsing chairs, and newspaper clippings about dark events.  Wait a second...newspaper clippings?  Is someone playing a joke, or is this real?  There is the hook.
Severed heads, rattlenakes, and Muffy's slow transformation from college beauty to frumpy borderline personality disorder mix evenly with dirty tricks and foolish pranks.  What is real? How much danger is everyone in?
There is no argument that April Fools Day was riding in on the wave of 80's slasher films, but that is where the similarity to other genre movies ends.  You really have to think at this one.  They really want to you ask yourself ""is this all a joke?"" and ""could anyone have actually survived that?""
I have to give some credit to the music for setting up some great tension.  It adds to the feel without taking you out of the moment.

This entertaining comedy thriller has memorable moments of excitement and chills. Directed by Fred Walton (When a Starnger Calls) shows style and a great time with the Cast, Familiar but Very Fun. Panavision. Grade:B+.",1011312000,3,544,5.055555555555555

Just a poor man's witty slasher/mystery movie with a twist ending that, if you read the title literally, is pretty guessable, and insulting.  You're better off sticking with the real thing.",1003190400,5,617,4.866666666666666
256631,1,6300214672,This movie totally sucked. The popcorn I was eating was more fascinating. It was stupid with a bunch of sex jokes blink-182 could top in a day. This is horror? Horribly bad attempt at trying to be funny and scary at the same time.,995760000,2,230,4.25

The next day her friends seem to be going missing, is it just April Fools jokes or is there something more sinister at work.  April Fools Day is a fun slasher film made by the people of Friday The 13th Part 1-6. The movie is fun and it is one of those must see twice movies. The ending is actully quite good I enjoyed the whole movie but it's nothing compleatly special just something worth getting and watching it twice. The gore in this movie is not bad, it's a gory enough movie but this one is more about story line then violence.",981158400,5,743,4.159722222222222

256635,4,6300214672,"I'll admit that I'm the person who watches a horror flick with my hands over my eyes, with my eyes peeking through. When I read the back of the box, I expected I would be doing this the whole way through. I was in for a surprise. April Fool's Day was more mystery than anything else. I found myself breathless with suspense at some moments, and with others I was giggling. This movie was better than expected. It is years ahead of the current copycat whodunnits around like Scream among others. And Deborah Foreman is a delight! I thought she was hilarious and sweet in Valley Girl(also a film to watch), and I liked her even more as an actress here. Anyway I definitely recommend this film to anyone who is tired of the pointless horror films around and enjoys intelligent, creative suspense. Check it out!",975542400,,807,4.534246575342466
256636,4,6300214672,"I am a pretty jaded horror fan and when it comes to slashers i thought i'd  seen it all. But this very underrated slasher has made me think twice, just  as scream did three years ago. This being 12 years older than Scream  though, I'd say this was very ahead of its time. Slightly tongue in cheek,  while still remaining tense and interesting, this is one of those rare B  movies which is actually inspired filmmaking. Alot of fun, and not  exploitative like the majority of its kin. Recommended.",966729600,,496,4.51685393258427
256637,4,6300214672,"This film is funny, but it is also scary.  I would say that it is a black comedy, but black comedies make death and violence funny.  This film does not.  It is very funny, but when the death count starts adding up, I  promise you won't be laughing.  It is kind of like ""Scream"" in  the way it makes you laugh, then makes you scream.  But, this is much  funnier than ""Scream"" or any other modern horror flick.  It is  very obvious that this film was made during the slasher period with films  like ""Halloween"" & ""Friday the 13th"".  But, what  sets it apart is the comedy added inbetween, and the very surprise ending  that comes at the end.  I guarantee that it will shock you completely.",959472000,,687,4.299212598425197

A college girl invites her friends over to spend a weekend at her home on an island and everything starts out just fine... at least until her friends start  disappearing or apparently being found cut up in pieces, then everyone  starts accusing the other of being the murderer and all they want to do is  leave the island, which proves to be easier said than done. bone chilling,  spine tingling suspense and horror. Who done it? will anyone figure it out?  will anyone live to tell the story of all the Ghastly events that went on  in the house? Get the movie and see for yourself. Is the girl of the house  insane? or is it one of her friends? If you like a good plot, you must see  the surprising ending to this unique film. Strong language, but not as  extreme as is the case for most suspense movies today and only one actual  steamy scene, but not exactly over graphic. In fact the scene is only a few  seconds in length. This is another one to watch with a lover  on Halloween  night, or even with a group of friends. Five stars is not enough for April  Fools day. It deserves many more.",946857600,7,1156,4.2626728110599075

""APRIL FOOL'S DAY"" has a surprise ending that was completely unexpected, and therefore, should have been the best of the three movies.

Unfortunately, ""APRIL FOOL'S DAY"", which is obviously targeted at teenagers, is full of sex and profanity, which was not necessary for telling the story.",1496880000,,346,5.2727272727272725
