2434584,5,B000BP86P0,"Facinating and revealing look into what life was like in 1960 as a migrant worker. I was born and raised in Miami, Fla and to think this was going on not more than 25 miles from where I was born really shocks me.

This expos is amazing and worth it. Buy it, and share it with your friends and family.

Elect Mitt Romney, and this is his vision of work & jobs in America. Let him and his forces of money rule our nation and we'll all be back to living as these people were forced to live.",1349049600,,487,3.9591836734693877
2434585,4,B000BP86P0,"I had to watch this for school, but am glad I did. My boyfriend and I were rivited. To imagine how long ago it was shown-Murrow is a genious.",1344038400,,141,3.896551724137931
2434586,5,B000BP86P0,"I saw the original airing more then 50 years ago and it deeply moved me.  Very little, if anything, has changed.  This should be a required viewing for anyone who eats fresh food in America!!!",1342137600,,192,4.457142857142857
2434587,5,B000BP86P0,Every school age child should watch this to gain a renewed apprecation for what they have now.  The common view of entitlement among the young would disappear with an honest look at some of the realities of where we come from.,1298419200,,226,4.512195121951219
2434588,5,B000BP86P0,Edward R. Murrow is now a legend of newscasting.  This is one of the reasons.  Relevant in 1960 and relevant still today (2010).  The immigration discussion has many facets and this is worth considering.,1283126400,5,203,4.911764705882353
2434589,5,B000BP86P0,"I waited for years for an opportunity to see this and I can honestly say it was worth the wait.
This is a fantastic record of history, albeit a shamefull one, but still something to be seen.
After seeing this documentary one wonders what ever became of these people. It would be interesting to see.
I cannot recommend highly enough viewing this.",1263686400,11,345,4.580645161290323
2434590,4,B000BP86P0,"This is kind of an eye opener to how hardened we have become.. This is a well done expose (given the time and technology available) of the plight of the seasonal migrant worker (at the time, just about all Americans by birth; Caucasian and Black), and the difficulty of their life.

I think what got me is that if Edward R Murrow thought this was a ""Harvest of Shame"" when this was made, he would have had a stroke if he knew what was going on now.. it was meant to be shocking and shameful, but it seemed quaint. That is not because of anything the makers did wrong, just on how times have changed so much.. if this had been produced today they wouldn't find a buyer, no one would care, too much apathy in the society, and suffering from empathy fatigue.. It is interesting that it caused such a stir when it came out.

It is worth a watch to understand the different mindset that was there then, and how it is different now.",1238112000,16,926,4.255681818181818

8090468,5,B000BP86P0,"I bought this to accompany a unit I was teaching on migrant workers to illustrate the reality of their lives.  My city kids had no idea, and the images had quite an impact on them.",1484265600,,180,4.142857142857143

8090472,5,B000BP86P0,"Edward R. Murrow is perhaps one of the most courageous newsmen of all time.  He took on real causes of suffering, not frustration over minor things.  This story is one that is must-see for anyone interested in changing true injustice.",1394928000,4,234,4.825
8090473,5,B000BP86P0,"When you see greed like this time,conglomerates,evil that won't even keep jobs in the u.s. ,before its outsourced.but its nice to think,that some people actually put it all on the line for the people trying to get by on$ 1.00  a day.and the bit where the man hireing the cheap labor ,actually saying that their happy and its the gypsy in them,was hilarious! No safe working conditions,so dead workers,but who cares?its good for the economy,its nice to remember that a time existed when its about humanity.to bad we forgot that",1386806400,4,526,4.844444444444444
