8087157,5,B000BITV5G,"Jim Hanvey (Guy Kibbee) is a slightly crabby detective who must bare the price of being too clever for his own good.  He is hounded by an insurance company to find a missing emerald necklace.  Said necklace was stolen as a prank then stolen again as it was being returned.  To complicate matters, a butler is killed during the commission of the second theft.  The prime suspect is poor dopey Don Terry (Tom Brown).  His future mother-in-law was the owner of said necklace.  Needless to say, this puts a slight damper on any impending nuptials.  Fortunately, Detective Hanvey is convinced of his innocence and willing to help straighten out the mess.  More complications ensue when a pair of nitwit crooks and their `boss' get involved.  Can Hanvey save the day and stay alive long enough to see that justice prevails?

This is a fun film primarily due to Guy Kibbee's performance as the crusty old duffer who would rather hunt rabbits than get involved in someone else's mess.  He's sarcastic and brutally honest in his assessment of people and the situations they find themselves in.  Equally amusing is the befuddled owner of the necklace (Catherine Doucet as Adelaide Frost).  She never has a full grasp of what's going on...........especially when she gives her butler an order while he's lying dead on the floor.

Quality of their unrestored movie transfers varies from fair to good, based on condition of film stock and source material (often old 16mm broadcast prints). The only extras provided are a catalog insert and DVD-accessible title list.

The likeable star of JIM HANVEY, DETECTIVE, Guy Kibbee was a riverboat entertainer who went to Hollywood at age 49. Kibbee was a member of Warner's stock company, but here he's in a REPUBLIC 'B' unit programmer. Kid brother Milton followed him to Tinsel Town and had minor or uncredited roles in nearly 400 movies, but Guy was the more-recognized of the two, with billing in many classic films.

SYNOPSIS--
In this better-than-average murder mystery, the butler doesn't do it. In fact, he ends up room temperature.

Retired detective Hanvey is reticent to locate a stolen emerald necklace for an insurance company that's willing to pay 1K for its return, but he takes the case to help out a young couple in trouble. In order to win a bet with a pair of businessmen that he can heist the choker without being caught, the boyfriend of the dingus owner's daughter gets the safe combination from her. He absconds with the rocks intending to return them later but wakes up the next day and finds them missing.

An honest cabbie gives the young fellow the necklace that he clumsily left in the man's taxi. While he secretly tries to place the jewels back in mom's safe, a gunshot is heard. The boyfriend is then found standing over the newly-plugged corpse of the family butler.
