8723663,5,B0116DUYYQ,"This is the show that started my 4 year old loving ALASKA. He wants to go there and meet the people that are on this
show. He loves them and treats them like they live next door and he has known them all his life. Hopefully one day I can send him on the railroad to meet Danny, Animal, (his favorites), Bill, Bruce and the Condutor Harry Ross. We will forever miss Hugh.",1529712000,,370,4.082191780821918
8723664,5,B0116DUYYQ,"Fun programs to watch, especially if you appreciate railroading.  The programs include the ""bumpers"" that lead in and out of the commercial breaks, but there is just 1 second of black where the commercials would be.  Technical quality of video was better from this DVD than it was from the FIOS HD channel when it aired originally.",1509753600,,331,4.7894736842105265

8723666,4,B0116DUYYQ,This was a very good set of DVD's.  I did not realize that people along the Alaska RR tracks depended so much on the RR to survive.  The trains will drop off and pickup people most anywhere along the route.  Also it showed the day to day work needed to keep the RR running.,1485820800,,273,4.018518518518518
