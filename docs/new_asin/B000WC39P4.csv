His translation to TV was good and  lasted three seasons. Remarkable for a NON MAJOR DC hero

The adventures of a man-turned-muck monster. Swamp Thing was once a man named Alec Holland, but after being caught on fire, doused with strange chemicals, and dumped into the Louisiana swamps by the evil Dr. Anton Arcane, Alec's body mutated. No longer is he human, or even an animal. His body is made from the muck and plants of the swamp. He's super strong and can make plants do his bidding. Good thing he's on our side

This muck monster with a heart owes a debt to Frankenstein legend. Mark Chapman (not a relation to John Lennon's killer) plays the Thing's foil, Dr Arcane, a mad doctor who is doing expierements on mutations.

The make up other than Swamp Thing costume was not always the greatest. For example, the Episode where Paul Mark Richman was man/falcon looked slightly cheesy, but it did seem to convey it..similar to some of the monsters from the 70s-80s Dr Who

Dick Durrock plays the Thing with a heart. His origins were unexplained but in bits and pieces through the shows run, but it worked and made this a hit

Now on DVD, you can relive the episodes. The episodes were tight without major sub plots and major character devices. These shows were told in half hour episodes which seem to work

Its format was a simple good vs evil and it works

It is rated four stars because they could have put some sort of commentary on a few episodes. There is extra of interviews with Lein Wein (who created the comic version) and Dick Durrock who played the monster

2966272,3,B000WC39P4,"After a campy but enjoyable first film directed by Wes Craven, and an ungodly bad sequel, Swamp Thing got himself his own live action TV series (a short-lived cartoon would follow as well), with none other than longtime stunt man Dick Durock reprising his role from the films as the tortured, muck monster.  First off, it should be noted that Swamp Thing was quite low budget, but for its time, the show somehow managed to pretty much work for what it was.  However, what really hurt the show was the schizophrenic writing, which would focus on Swamp Thing one minute, and then treat him as a back seat, supporting character the next.  As a whole, the show was a mixed bag, yet at the same time, it managed to be pretty enjoyable.  The supporting cast, which included Mark Lindsay Chapman as Swampy's old nemesis Dr. Anton Arcane, Carrell Myers as the friendly Tressa, and a young Kari Wuhrer who briefly appears as Abigail.  If you enjoyed the show when it originally aired, this DVD set is worth picking up, and if you're an old fan of the DC character, this may be worth a look, although those fans might feel better off sticking with the classic comics by Alan Moore instead.",1203292800,12,1179,4.568720379146919

Tis awsome that Alec and his buddies finally made it to dvd. The quality is good.. the transfer seems really nice and there are come color corrections to it that i never noticed on my lousy tv and on broadcast tv. Well I hope you all like it as much as I do.. Only two small gripes.. 1) lack of specail featuers(though the Dick Durrock interview was nice) and 2) how bloody long do we have to wait for the second half!!?

I developed a fascination for the character. When the TV series came out on cable, I decided to tune in every chance I got and was quite impressed with it. The series had much more to do with the comics  than the films ever did and really fleshed out the character. For it's time, it was a series that took it's source material very seriously.

2966357,4,B000WC39P4,"I remember this series from the latter days of my undergrad years at college. It was in the cadre of syndicated offerings that Fox and some non-network channels offered during the early 90's, like Night Man, Super Boy, and Friday the Thirteenth the Series. It was fine Saturday afternoon fare for the overworked mind, and had it's special charm. The real prime mover of this series, produced by Universal Studios Florida who also created Super Boy, is stuntman/actor Dick Durock who starred in the 1982original and it's tongue in cheek sequel some seven years later.

The stories are often cheesy, the performance by the actor who plays Dr. Arcane is the definition of ""over the top,"" and the supporting characters are at times so treacle, you'll need to brush your teeth after viewing, but let's be honest with each other: we watch for Swamp Thing. The series is a fine testimony to the work and talents of the late Dick Durock, who brought a dignity and gravitas to the character. He walks the marshy landscape of the series, fighting evil doers, polluters, orchid thieves, and Arcane's twisted genetic experiments with a grace that makes us admire and love him. Always returning to the depths of the swamp with a final observation on the episode's events like some herbal Rod Serling.

It's easy to get caught up in action and forgive (if not forget) the shortcomings of the story and the supporting cast. For a b-grade syndicated TV series, the effects aren't horrible.  Bear in mind this predates the technology that made such wonders as say the pod race in Star Wars Episode One possible, so given that they had to do this the old way, their not bad.  And they get it right where it's important: Swamp Thing is flawlessly acquitted in green and vegetation, and does not look like a man in a Swamp Thing suit.",1401580800,2,1814,4.712933753943218

Special effects are pretty good for 1990 and as for violence or language wasn't that bad at all.  I guess if your a fan of the comic book or movie you might like it, but I'm not for sure as I saw the Wes Craven movie and didn't much like that either.

Now, I don't know how closely this series followed the comics, but I will say this: even though I like director Wes Craven's movies-including this one, and I must be in the minority of liking ""Return of ST"", oh well. The series seemed to have been better scripted and acted, and hand picked by creators who knew of or even read the comics, and that is commendable. Mark Lindsay Chapman does a very nice job as the evil Dr. Arcane, and now, I can easily say that he did better than Louis Jourdan, even though both actors chew up the screen with their portrayals,imo.

2966387,3,B000WC39P4,"Let me start by saying I am a Swamp Thing fan and a DC Comics fanatic. Compared to the comics or even the movies, this series is a pretty big letdown. Its obvious that they had some major budget issues because we get 95% of all episodes filmed in the daylight (no money for lights) and everything appears to be filmed within a 300 foot wide swamp setting. There is not a lot of exploration of the city they live in and even when people venture into the swamp its always the same few spots that they visit. The costume design for the Swamp Thing character is pretty good, but the costumes of the other creatures are humorous and pretty pathetic. The storylines as well really don't involve Swamp Thing in any major way, he is just kind of there to give sage advice and occasionally break out his plant power. There is one shining star and that is Mark Lindsay Chapman as Anton Arcane. I have never hated a villain so much since Dr. Pretorius in ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" or Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs Of New York"". You may not be crazy about his abilities, but it takes a really talented actor to make the audience hate him or her! I guess I have no complaints about Dick Durock's acting either, but considering the series is named after his character he is way too underutilized. I purchased it from Amazon for 6 or 7 bucks so it was worth getting, but if you're a real Swamp Thing nut and you are expecting dark, supernatural storylines then you should probably just stick with the comics or the Wes Craven film. After the first season it does get better, but overall it is still only worthy of 3 stars.",1308441600,,1602,4.361204013377926
2966388,2,B000WC39P4,"I'm not going to bother reading positive reviews of this Swamp Thing series because those reviews could not make ths show watchable for me. I always loved the Swamp Thing comic, the original 70's magazine. The first Swampt Thing movie was OK, but this series was just awful. I actually have not seen anything quite this infantile before. I suppose if you are in grammar school then perhaps this sort of show might interest you. This series was just freaking bizzarre in my opinion. I give the show two stars for the great Swamp Thing costume and makes up. Sure, he's a little rubbery and jiggling in some places but ol' swampy looks like the real deal, and that look is very faithful to the comic book. This series, however, was simply unwatchable for this reviewer. I bought the set for perhaps $20 at Walmart. I watched four episodes. The show was just so awful to the point of retarding my senses. I give the show two stars for the special effects of the Swamp Thing.

Based on the DC comic book character, the ""Swamp Thing"" made his debut in 1990 for the first time on television following the two movies from the 80's. For the first time ever fans can see all 22 episodes comprising of seasons one & two the way they were meant to be seen, in order. When the show was originally broadcast on the television the episodes were shown out of order making the story hard to follow at times.

Dr. Anton Arcane is looking for a secret elixir; some would call it the fountain of youth. Through his research Dr. Alec Holland believes he has created a new chemical composition and its value could be immeasurable to the world. After being immersed with chemicals and set ablaze Dr. Alec Holland's badly burned body is thrown into the Louisiana swamp by the ruthless Dr. Arcane. After some time in the swamp Alec's body has begun to regenerate itself and it has now mutated into some form of plant & swamp creature. No longer human the ""Swamp Thing"" sets out to destroy the person responsible for causing his mutation. Welcome to the ""Swamp Thing"" seasons one & two on DVD.

This half hour show wasn't always the best. Some stories were better than others and the show was definitely campy entertainment, but the swamp thing creature was well done and Dick Durock was good in reprising his role. This four disc set from Shout Factory is a must for any fan of the show. All 22 episodes are spread out over four single sided discs with great artwork and packaging. The video transfer in my opinion is excellent and the sound is crisp and clean. I have really enjoyed watching the first 22 episodes in order and gained a new appreciation for this show.

His translation to TV was good and  lasted three seasons. Remarkable for a NON MAJOR DC hero

The adventures of a man-turned-muck monster. Swamp Thing was once a man named Alec Holland, but after being caught on fire, doused with strange chemicals, and dumped into the Louisiana swamps by the evil Dr. Anton Arcane, Alec's body mutated. No longer is he human, or even an animal. His body is made from the muck and plants of the swamp. He's super strong and can make plants do his bidding. Good thing he's on our side

This muck monster with a heart owes a debt to Frankenstein legend. Mark Chapman (not a relation to John Lennon's killer) plays the Thing's foil, Dr Arcane, a mad doctor who is doing expierements on mutations.

The make up other than Swamp Thing costume was not always the greatest. For example, the Episode where Paul Mark Richman was man/falcon looked slightly cheesy, but it did seem to convey it..similar to some of the monsters from the 70s-80s Dr Who

Dick Durrock plays the Thing with a heart. His origins were unexplained but in bits and pieces through the shows run, but it worked and made this a hit

Now on DVD, you can relive the episodes. The episodes were tight without major sub plots and major character devices. These shows were told in half hour episodes which seem to work

Its format was a simple good vs evil and it works

It is rated four stars because they could have put some sort of commentary on a few episodes. There is extra of interviews with Lein Wein (who created the comic version) and Dick Durrock who played the monster

Tis awsome that Alec and his buddies finally made it to dvd. The quality is good.. the transfer seems really nice and there are come color corrections to it that i never noticed on my lousy tv and on broadcast tv. Well I hope you all like it as much as I do.. Only two small gripes.. 1) lack of specail featuers(though the Dick Durrock interview was nice) and 2) how bloody long do we have to wait for the second half!!?

I developed a fascination for the character. When the TV series came out on cable, I decided to tune in every chance I got and was quite impressed with it. The series had much more to do with the comics  than the films ever did and really fleshed out the character. For it's time, it was a series that took it's source material very seriously.

3200854,4,B000WC39P4,"I remember this series from the latter days of my undergrad years at college. It was in the cadre of syndicated offerings that Fox and some non-network channels offered during the early 90's, like Night Man, Super Boy, and Friday the Thirteenth the Series. It was fine Saturday afternoon fare for the overworked mind, and had it's special charm. The real prime mover of this series, produced by Universal Studios Florida who also created Super Boy, is stuntman/actor Dick Durock who starred in the 1982original and it's tongue in cheek sequel some seven years later.

The stories are often cheesy, the performance by the actor who plays Dr. Arcane is the definition of ""over the top,"" and the supporting characters are at times so treacle, you'll need to brush your teeth after viewing, but let's be honest with each other: we watch for Swamp Thing. The series is a fine testimony to the work and talents of the late Dick Durock, who brought a dignity and gravitas to the character. He walks the marshy landscape of the series, fighting evil doers, polluters, orchid thieves, and Arcane's twisted genetic experiments with a grace that makes us admire and love him. Always returning to the depths of the swamp with a final observation on the episode's events like some herbal Rod Serling.

It's easy to get caught up in action and forgive (if not forget) the shortcomings of the story and the supporting cast. For a b-grade syndicated TV series, the effects aren't horrible.  Bear in mind this predates the technology that made such wonders as say the pod race in Star Wars Episode One possible, so given that they had to do this the old way, their not bad.  And they get it right where it's important: Swamp Thing is flawlessly acquitted in green and vegetation, and does not look like a man in a Swamp Thing suit.",1401580800,2,1814,4.712933753943218

The series seemed to have been better scripted and acted, and hand picked by creators who knew of or even read the comics, and that is commendable.

3200884,3,B000WC39P4,"Let me start by saying I am a Swamp Thing fan and a DC Comics fanatic. Compared to the comics or even the movies, this series is a pretty big letdown. Its obvious that they had some major budget issues because we get 95% of all episodes filmed in the daylight (no money for lights) and everything appears to be filmed within a 300 foot wide swamp setting. There is not a lot of exploration of the city they live in and even when people venture into the swamp its always the same few spots that they visit. The costume design for the Swamp Thing character is pretty good, but the costumes of the other creatures are humorous and pretty pathetic. The storylines as well really don't involve Swamp Thing in any major way, he is just kind of there to give sage advice and occasionally break out his plant power. There is one shining star and that is Mark Lindsay Chapman as Anton Arcane. I have never hated a villain so much since Dr. Pretorius in ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" or Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs Of New York"". You may not be crazy about his abilities, but it takes a really talented actor to make the audience hate him or her! I guess I have no complaints about Dick Durock's acting either, but considering the series is named after his character he is way too underutilized. I purchased it from Amazon for 6 or 7 bucks so it was worth getting, but if you're a real Swamp Thing nut and you are expecting dark, supernatural storylines then you should probably just stick with the comics or the Wes Craven film. After the first season it does get better, but overall it is still only worthy of 3 stars.",1308441600,,1602,4.361204013377926
3200885,2,B000WC39P4,"I'm not going to bother reading positive reviews of this Swamp Thing series because those reviews could not make ths show watchable for me.

I suppose if you are in grammar school then perhaps this sort of show might interest you. This series was just freaking bizzarre in my opinion. I give the show two stars for the great Swamp Thing costume and makes up. Sure, he's a little rubbery and jiggling in some places but ol' swampy looks like the real deal, and that look is very faithful to the comic book. This series, however, was simply unwatchable for this reviewer. I bought the set for perhaps $20 at Walmart. I watched four episodes. The show was just so awful to the point of retarding my senses. I give the show two stars for the special effects of the Swamp Thing.

3200888,5,B000WC39P4,"Fans of the ""Swamp Thing"" have 22 reasons to Shout!  Based on the DC comic book character, the ""Swamp Thing"" made his debut in 1990 for the first time on television following the two movies from the 80's. For the first time ever fans can see all 22 episodes comprising of seasons one & two the way they were meant to be seen, in order. When the show was originally broadcast on the television the episodes were shown out of order making the story hard to follow at times.

Dr. Anton Arcane is looking for a secret elixir; some would call it the fountain of youth. Through his research Dr. Alec Holland believes he has created a new chemical composition and its value could be immeasurable to the world. After being immersed with chemicals and set ablaze Dr. Alec Holland's badly burned body is thrown into the Louisiana swamp by the ruthless Dr. Arcane. After some time in the swamp Alec's body has begun to regenerate itself and it has now mutated into some form of plant & swamp creature. No longer human the ""Swamp Thing"" sets out to destroy the person responsible for causing his mutation. Welcome to the ""Swamp Thing"" seasons one & two on DVD.

This half hour show wasn't always the best. Some stories were better than others and the show was definitely campy entertainment, but the swamp thing creature was well done and Dick Durock was good in reprising his role. This four disc set from Shout Factory is a must for any fan of the show. All 22 episodes are spread out over four single sided discs with great artwork and packaging. The video transfer in my opinion is excellent and the sound is crisp and clean. I have really enjoyed watching the first 22 episodes in order and gained a new appreciation for this show.

8222385,4,B000WC39P4,"I know you're wondering why it's taken me so long to get around to reviewing this release, but wait no more, here comes my detailed analysis below:
While he's long been one of my favorite comic book characters, my exposure to Swamp Thing has mostly been through other media rather than the comics: namely, novelizations, movies, fan art, and especially television. In any case, Swampy has had a particularly rough ride in terms of the cinema, where his characterization remains both underused and misunderstood. However, the psychologically traumatized screenwriter Joseph Stefano managed to develop a television series pitch back in the 80's for this particular show and, once it was greenlighted in the early 90's, the series took off for a not-so-spectacular run (for three seasons), and yet when it debuted it was apparently the highest rated program to appear on TV at that particular time.
And make no mistake, SWAMP THING: THE SERIES is a show very much of its time, but to my way of thinking this isn't a bad thing. In fact, I enjoy the rather laidback tone of the show, even though it essentially relegates the Swamp Thing character to the background and focuses upon a parade of human characters, chief amongst these being the mightily dysfunctional Kipp family, who seem to keep surprising themselves with revelations as the show progresses as well as the viewers. Swampy, of course, is not quite the same type of ""superhero"" figure as Batman (for example), and really the show gives the character a rather complicated sense of ethics and moral initiatives (Swamp Thing will not kill the swamp's great nemesis, Anton Arcane (played here by the strong Mark Lindsay Chapman, who raises this material to a level that it really doesn't require), but he does ""tree"" a particularly nasty man in the show's opening episode ""The Emerald Heart,"" which leads me to believe that the show's ""bible"" was not thoroughly set in stone by the time the cameras started to roll. You might best imagine SWAMP THING: THE SERIES as a kind of Louisiana bayou ""swamp opera,"" with some hammy acting, some over-the-top (and poorly introduced) creatures, and a dark sense of humor, all governed over by the mysterious creature that the lead protagonist Doctor Alec Holland has turned into.
I was initially going to complain about seeing Chapman's face all over this show, but to be fair, they do give us a fair amount of the beautiful (and now sadly forgotten) Carrell Myers (playing the often bewildered Tressa Kipp), a lovely lady who lends the show a strong air of beauty and sex appeal (I suppose the same could be said of the lovely Abigail, who is a particularly strong presence on the last two discs in this set). But even with all of these good looking people aboard, I personally would have been happy with more Swamp Thing, but again it was Stefano's and the network's choice to make the show more of a human drama rather than a muck-encrusted show about the beasties alone, and on this level their logic makes sense, dramatically speaking. However, considering how brief that the run of the series actually was, it is odd now, in hindsight, that the series' creators were so eager to write characters out just for the sole purposes of bringing new ones in--all of this losing and begetting of characters gets to be a bit confusing after awhile, but only for those who are paying attention in the first place!
Also of note is that on this collection the first original 22 episodes of the show are said to be in their proper order (story wise) rather than their original airing dates, but since I really don't recall what order the episodes were in when I was younger this fact-checking mission is sort of pointless now. Even in their ""proper"" order, the show seems to me to have some major inconsistencies (and judging by some of the other negative reviews here on Amazon, other reviewers didn't enjoy the quality of the show much at all), but there is still enough dramatic interest in the individual episodes to warrant repeated viewings, especially if you love Swamp Thing as much as I do (and I realize that this show isn't going to be to everyone's taste).
Rounding out the discs is a double interview with series co-creator Len Wein (who speaks for about seven and a half minutes about how he came to create the character in a DC comics ""House of Mystery"" short story, and the character's subsequent development in other media), and stuntman/stand-in/actor Dick Durock, who gives some interesting background about how he came to take on the role of the Swamp Thing character (his comments are always fun to hear, and be careful if you IMDB his extensive list of credits, lest your computer suffer a case of sensory overload). This is a nifty little extra that is more like a tacked on bonus feature rather than an in-depth look at the show, but since the creators and producers were always under the gun I doubt that there was ever an extensive documentary shot about the making of this series anyway. The best thing about the show, however, is how it examines a tormented creature who once knew the pleasures and pains of a man, but who is now trapped inside a monster's body, slowly losing his touch with humanity and even his own personality. Working anonymously from the shadows, Swamp Thing works to intervene on behalf of the show's many troubled characters, but he's not a flamboyant Wolverine type who can take drastic action when necessary. The melancholic Dr. Alec Holland is trying to become human again, but he's losing time and he also cannot forget the wife that he once loved so dearly, Linda Holland...and because the show never quite closes the gap on the many emotional tragedies that it portrays, we as viewers are kind of left hanging emotionally due to all of these unresolved dramatic arcs. And yet there are some fun animatronic puppets and creature feature creations included in these shows, so if you are a monster movie fan (like me) then you'll appreciate the kind of hand-crafted and often simplistic approach to practical effects that this show takes. And if you like the Louisiana bayou or any kinds of tales set in the swamp lands, then you'll enjoy this show for its outdoor scenery alone. Just don't expect this show to cater to you in any way, especially if you have been weaned on modern, politically correct television programs that are more about agenda pushing than genuine escapist entertainment. Still, the program seems to be reaching at times, trying out every science fiction and horror movie clich&eacute; and trope before it slimes its way across the finish line. From what I've read about his situation, screenwriter/producer Stefano seemed to be growing especially alienated from the Hollywood scene at this time, and his efforts at saving this show seem to illustrate his failure to make modern audiences sympathetic to stories that are a bit more geared for older and more ""pulp"" oriented people (like me). It reminds me at times of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE, another program that adapted ""pulp"" works from fairly obscure authors and attempted to bring old-fashioned concepts and monster movie tropes up to date for a new generation. I do wish they would have succeeded even more than what they did.
All this being said, the show does have some reasonably good individual episodes if you enjoy ""sci-fi"" and thriller/horror television from the late 80's/early 90's. There is the poetic and imaginative episode ""Falco"" (featuring the reliable character actor Peter Mark Richman) about a bird who is turned into a man-monster by Arcane; the violent actioner ""The Prometheus Parabola"" (while it sounds like mere pseudo-scientific complication, it is actually a fun, if not terrifically acted, episode); the problematic episode ""The Shipment"" (which is an unusually suspenseful episode); ""Silent Screams"" (which is also a pseudo-scientific thriller of an episode about a particularly nasty force field); ""The Watchers"" (a thrilling episode involving robots and test tube children); and even ""Legend of the Swamp Maiden"" (featuring a sexy (at least in her human form!) Heidi Paine, starring in the perfect episode for a dog days of summer evening in which she lures young boys, and eventually Swamp Thing, into a confrontation that has mythical implications). For fans of television animation and even comic book stories, it should be noted that Michael Reaves provided the story for the episode ""Spirit of the Swamp,"" and that Marc Scott Zicree (author of THE TWILIGHT ZONE COMPANION) authored the story for the episode entitled ""Blood Wind."" But many other episodes are just as much fun to watch, if you enjoy this sort of thing. The screenwriting team of Tom Greene and William Whitehead (both production guys who also wrote some episodes of THE INCREDIBLE HULK TV series) provide scripts for many of the most involving episodes as well. I must also say a quick word about the transfer of these programs onto DVD. The image is presented in full screen (1.33:1, which is really 4:3 standard frame for TV episodes), and includes a decent image and sound carryover onto the digital format. However, in the Wein/Durock documentary bit, there is a brief glimpse of a tightly made widescreen print of an episode with the black bars at the top and bottom, and looks much more intense than the rather pallid transfer that we have on the standard episodes. It would have been nice to have each episode available in this widescreen format, but since we do have all of the episodes available now on DVD I don't want to complain too much. For those who enjoy getting nostalgic, and don't mind the afterschool special atmosphere of this show, I say indulge yourself in this swamp marsh for awhile and enjoy. B+ (for the entire box)
SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT YET WATCHED THE SERIES...well, even though I do recommend the show to viewers who like a little cheese with their TV shows, I do have some issues with the series in terms of its writing and development. First, and most troubling, is the disappearance of the Jim Kipp character after he is sold into the slave trade (!), and how the corrupt town sheriff and Arcane work towards convincing Tressa that he was ran over and killed in a bicycling incident. This was a really tragic thing to happen, even in a fluffy program such as this. The writers of the show did not seem to follow up on it very well. The following episode after ""The Shipment"" is a show entitled ""Birth Marks"", and Tressa seems far too jovial and emotionally detached considering that her son was just killed in a tragic accident! Most mothers I know would not be able to accept such a thing so easily, much less put such a tragedy behind them as quickly as Tressa Kipp does here. Writing Jim Kipp out of the show seemed to be a lackluster effort at removing him from the memory of viewers, which was kind of a silly move, since Jim was crucial to the early episodes. This is a dangling storyline that simply leaves us hanging in a very unsatisfying way (especially since the Jim Kipp character never comes back in any of the subsequent shows in the second and third seasons). Also, Swamp Thing swears to get his revenge for the kidnapping/fake murder incident of Jim by ""moving Heaven and Hell"" to do so, but by the time of the next episode even Swampy forgets about the kid (played in a rather carefree way by child star Jesse Ziegler, who does a pretty good job of acting like a fanciful young boy without solid parenting in his life).
Also, the character of Will (though played by the likeable Scott Garrison) seems to have been brought in for the sole purpose of drawing in more squealing teenage girls to watch the show--in one episode, he quickly pulls his shirt off for a rather flimsy reason (if you ask me). Will initially appears to be an intense character addition, but soon enough everyone forgets about Jim Kipp having gone missing, and before you know it these folks are back to living normal lives. Other characters, such as Will's father (who only comes in for one episode), seem to have been included just because the producers could get a particular actor for a day's work.
And just to nitpick a bit further, much of the dialogue in this series is admittedly quite silly, although it does get better as the series progresses. Carrell Myers is a breathtaking beauty indeed, but her acting is often forced on this show. Having the luscious Kari Wuhrer come aboard as Abigail (as a synthetic woman!) is a welcome thing for the old eyes, but her character is mysteriously underdeveloped all things considering. Abigail's character is introduced abruptly at the beginning of one episode, and before you know it she's a major part of the show, even though essentially she came from out of nowhere and does not serve a strong dramatic purpose (the budding romance between her and Will is a little late in the coming, if you ask me). And while Chapman certainly has fun eating up the scenery (so to speak), he's really operating at the level of another series, making us question why the producers didn't pick a different actor to portray Arcane in a more serious (and maybe more threatening) fashion. Holding the show together is, of course, Durock as the ""insidious swamp creature"", but he has to act as a moderator within his own show, with the writers only giving us a few hints of his deep melancholy rather than trying to pursue his arc alone. SWAMP THING: THE SERIES is unique among TV programs of its era, and I personally think it's a fascinating show to watch, but the writers keep introducing new narrative trajectories at the beginning of each new episode while simultaneously attempting to keep the background story in check. Without a strong story editor aboard, I think the series quickly lost its way, narratively speaking. But I do have to say that it kept me watching to see what would happen next, and that is a compliment of a rather tremendous nature in these information-ready days.",1488240000,3,13999,4.7947019867549665
