7983766,4,B00008G8X1,"As you can guess from the cover and title, Nabonga is about a man in a gorilla suit named ""Samson.""  A plane crashes in the jungle with stolen jewels and securities. Doreen, a Shirley Temple clone, survives the crash and lives until adulthood becoming a gorilla whisperer. She has become a legend as ""the white witch."" Buster Crabbe, sometimes known a ""Bwana"" looks for the treasure as bad guys follow him.

Doreen (Julie London) as an adult living in the jungle has smooth silky white skin without a scratch, like most real live Hollywood Jungle women. The film I watched was restored, at least the part filmed on a set. The stock footage, films from the jungles in Africa...and around the world, was edited into the film at random points. It wasn't restored that well.

The film is camp nostalgia. The end included a plea to buy war bonds and stamps.",1484006400,,852,4.629139072847682
7983767,3,B00008G8X1,"The old white-girl-raised-in-the-jungle story. This time her father was an embezzler and the hero and villain are after the loot, for though for different reasons. Standard jungle tale of the era but Crabbe is suitably heroic. Video quality is poor but typical from Alpha.",1423872000,,272,5.204545454545454
7983768,3,B00008G8X1,"Okay, I admit it. I enjoy lots of low budget jungle movies, and NABONGA is one of the cheapest and best of the lot. Released by the poverty row PRC studio in 1944, this Saturday matinee programmer is of interest mainly because of its cast. The always dependable Buster Crabbe is once again the hero, Warner Bros. stock heavy Barton MacLane is the villain, and sultry singer Julie London (in her movie debut) is the girl raised in the jungle who befriends a killer gorilla, played by stunt man Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan. Corrigan owned his own gorilla costume (an excellent one, by the way) and appeared in many films and serials.

Directed by B-movie journeyman Sam Newfield, NABONGA is enjoyable for what it is - a modest adventure yarn done in the flavor of the serial chapter plays that were so popular during the classic era of the '30's and '40's. Not every movie needs to be on a par with CITIZEN KANE. Some we just watch for a bit of light hearted fun and
abandon. That's the spirit in which a movie like NABONGA should be viewed.

This review is for Alpha's version of NABONGA, which is one of the company's better looking features, clearly having been transferred from a good quality source. And considering the very affordable price, it's worth picking up.",1341878400,2,1261,4.625
7983769,3,B00008G8X1,"This is a fun film of the kind that was occasionally on on pre-ScoobyDoo Saturday afternoons, after the cartoons were finished and a friend was over.  Its great attraction is the inimitable Buster Crabbe, whose manliness and courage enable him to trek into the most hostile of environments.  This is a lively adventure, in which he goes into the jungle in search of treasure, but he is not a normal treasure hunter.

The film starts with the escape of a finance fraudster - echoes of contemporary America! - who crashes on an airplane in deepest Africa with his young daughter.  Cut to about 15 years later, and the young Crabbe is in a nearby colonial town, investigating rumors that a white witch is presiding with a gorilla over a treasure somewhere in the deepest interior.  A greedy bar owner and his sidekick, an aging entertainer barfly, listen in and go on a trek of their own in search of the treasure.  After many harrowing adventures, including wrestling with crocodiles and negotiating with a savage gorilla,  Crabbe finds the white witch and I'll give you three guesses who she is.  It is all very fun, over-the-top acting that you would expect from Flash Gordon, one of my childhood favorites.

OK, Crabbe has noble motives with a surprise of his own and the ending is somewhat of a deus ex machina as he decides to carry the dame back to civilization (with her treasure),  but you should not expect the African Queen as a standard of quality for this kind of studio swashbuckler.  I enjoyed it, my kids laughed at it a lot, and it held my attention.  I love Buster Crabbe.

REcommended to fans from that Saturday afternoon TV era.  It's nostalgic, you get a different view of Crabbe, some good fights, the gorilla suit is hilarious, and the story is not abominably stupid.",1290556800,,1787,4.667731629392971
7983770,2,B00008G8X1,"Well this will entertain you if you like to roll your eyes at how stupid the people pretend to be to get into trouble.

The telegram at the beggining is very hard to read and the shot is so short you have to stop the movie to read it.

The post has no explanation for it's existance and no logic for the ""villians"" actions are forthcoming.

  The attempted murder is incredibly contrived and a lame thread for the loyalty subsequently achieved. The so called ""dream"" excuse is just plain idiotic considering the action preceding this explanation...and it is completely nonsennsical that the people could have accepted this explanation.

  The so called epic trek through the jungle to reach the destination is hardly depicted as an epic in any way, and seems like a short jaunt through the woods.

 The dissapearance of the first villian is left completely to our immagination, as there is no explanation for his dissapearance.

  It seem every person in the movie looks for ways to put himself into mortal peril as there is virtualy no logic behind their actions.

  The storyline could have had huge love interest potential but was just squandered away. Very dissapointing in this facet...with only a few minor glimpes of what could have been.

  It's not a terrible movie as it's fun to laugh at or groan at but it's got ""B"" written all over it.

  The camerawork is  only fair and considering it's almost all jungle scenes it occasionaly difficult get much clarity.

  The cover of this DVD is deceptive too. The people on the cover look exceptionaly glamorous if that's even the people in the movie. and the ape on the cover is actualy a real one...not the one in the movie. But I had no difficulty loading the movie so it's of slightly better quality at least in that regard.

Overall very poorly written or directed...or both.",1224547200,,1833,4.682389937106918
