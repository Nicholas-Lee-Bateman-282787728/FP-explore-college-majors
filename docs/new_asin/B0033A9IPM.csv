4063750,5,B0033A9IPM,"Sacred Music is a fantastic journey through the roads of religious music, from medieval times, passing beautifully by the Palestrina's polyphonic music and arriving with authority  at the Baroque Era. I strongly recomend this splendid DVD to all music lovers, regardless of their religious conecttions. A.N. Martins.",1365465600,,316,5.723404255319149
4063751,5,B0033A9IPM,"""Sacred Music"" belongs on the shelf of every serious music lover, especially lovers of choral church music. In eight one-hours shows, Simon Russell Beale leads the viewer through the development of polyphonic church music from 1400 to the present. He is brilliantly assisted by Harry Christophers and The Sixteen, who perform illustrative bits of the various composers and compositions Beale discusses. I was familiar with Mr. Christophers and his group, but I didn't really appreciate their musical range until I listened to this series. Mr. Beale is an enjoyable ""tour guide,"" combining his own love of polyphonic sacred music with input from a variety of other experts in the field. I was sorry to see the series end. Happily, there are other programs related to this one.",1364947200,6,775,5.110236220472441
4063752,4,B0033A9IPM,"The scholarship is first rate, the venues are stunning, and the video and sound are first rate.  My only problem is with The Sixteen.  This iteration of The Sixteen includes a wobbly and too forward soprano.  After a while I found it almost impossible to listen to.",1362528000,2,265,4.595744680851064
4063753,5,B0033A9IPM,"This is a beautiful series on sacred music, produced by the BBC, with the guidance of Simon Russell Beale and participation of Harry Christopher and The Sixteen. The first chapter covers the Gothic revolution, the second the time of Palestrina and the Popes, the third Tallis, Byrd and the Tudors and the fourth Bach and the Lutheran heritage. Russell's guidance is appropriate, enjoyable and with appropriate environment, as we can see in the first chapter, with the architecture of Notre Dame in Paris to illustrate and hear beautiful works as the Viderunt Omnes. The second DVD brings several bonus tracks (Tallis, Byrd and Allegri). Interpretations of The Sixteen are beautiful and appropriate, although short, because the dynamics of the series. Recommended for fans of sacred music. Perhaps the BBC offer a second part of this series, showing the great sacred works of composers such as Haydn, Mozart and Bruckner.",1324080000,23,920,5.181208053691275

8387881,5,B0033A9IPM,"Watched an episode on YouTube and had to get the whole thing.  Only thing I wish it had was the story of Alegri's Miserere.

Since church music has taken a turn for the worse in the past 50 or so years, it is good to see the roots of church music particularly polyphony and Palestrina.",1460937600,,285,4.163636363636364

8387887,5,B0033A9IPM,"This is my go to DVD whenever I want to show somebody the wonders of sacred music. Also, as always, BBC does a great job with it's carefully selected takes, images and how this whole documentary comes together to create a true document that if no one ever decides to tackle sacred music as a subject to make a documentary about, this will do just fine.

I'm very disappointed tho that Season 2 is not to be released any time soon due to some issues that they are having with the BBC and archive footage apparently, this was sent to me via email by the Sixteens producer.",1393718400,8,570,4.327102803738318

8387889,5,B0033A9IPM,"This DVD offers an excellent overview of the history of sacred music, narrated by Simon Russell Beale  with superb performances of sacred vocal music by Harry Christophers and The Sixteen.  I enjoyed it so much, I selected it as the parting gift from a sacred brass ensemble for a music minister who was the ensemble's greatest supporter. Very highly recommended.",1375056000,,363,5.033333333333333
