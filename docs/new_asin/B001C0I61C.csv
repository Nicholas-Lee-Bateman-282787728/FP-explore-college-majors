3503363,5,B001C0I61C,"The cast is amazing, the writing is awesome, the characters are unique and hilarious, and the plots are always interesting.  There's no laugh track and what physical comedy is there isn't usually your run-of-the-mill pie in the face stuff.

Although the show leans heavily on the leading roles (Derek and Casey), they also give plenty of time to the rest of the main cast (Nora, George, Edwin, Lizzie, and Marti).  You'll laugh, you'll ""Awwww"", and then you'll laugh again.  Overall, the whole family is great, but the best part of this show is watching Derek and Casey wrestle for the position of the Alpha Dog in the McDonald-Venturi family.",1230940800,,643,4.871559633027523
3503364,5,B001C0I61C,I watched this first last summer because my 13-year-old sister liked it. I immediatley was hooked on the show. I'm 21 and I thought it was great. It reminds me a lot of when I was in high school. The show to me is kind of like Lizzie McGuire meets the Brady Bunch.  The cut-aways in the show are a lot like in Lizzie McGuire but the story of the family is a lot like Brady Bunch. I thought it'd be about Derek but it's more about Cassie's life (with Derek). It's for a little more mature children because of some of the things in the show. It's very funny and Ashley Leggat is really hot!,1229731200,7,588,4.068965517241379
3503365,5,B001C0I61C,I love this show and I had no idea that they had a dvd. Amazon has everything. Disney never advertised or anything. This dvd includes all the great episodes.,1229558400,,157,4.448275862068965

3503367,5,B001C0I61C,"I love this show! This clearly is the best show on Disney channel here.  It's the most realistic and most able to relate to. It doesn't have teens who are also pop stars, or has magical powers, or anything else that no other teenager can relate to.  It has real problems that teens deal with. Plus Michael Seater is gorgeous! I'm so excited that this is coming to DVD, because it will be great to watch all the episodes in order, in high quality! Cant wait for the rest of the series to come out!",1221868800,8,496,4.2105263157894735
3503368,5,B001C0I61C,"Talk about tween TV, my daughter is going to be thrilled when I tell her this series, one of her absolute favorites, is coming to DVD. For a long time she was unaware of this show, but about 3 months ago she came home from school chattering about it. As a parent I needed to watch through an episode or two first. Finding it totally ok for her, she began watching it as regularly as she has watched any of the shows for her age group (turning 9 shortly). I guess it's goodbye iCarly and hello Derek in this here household.

Blended family (sort of a modern twist on my generation's Brady Bunch), the story is really not about Derek, but about his sister and the entire family who has to live 'life with Derek'.

Good family fun. It's already on ""the list"" as a holiday gift. And, when I found it it comes with a poster, I intellegently  left that out of our conversation. She's going to be totally surprised by that little 'extra' indeed.",1217808000,9,938,4.318181818181818

3503372,5,B001C0I61C,"I used to watch Life with Derek everytime I saw it on and I'm in my late 20's, It's great for the whole family.",1363910400,,111,3.6666666666666665
3503373,5,B001C0I61C,Life with Derek is here on dvd and I loved it when it aired on Disney and I wish they still showed reruns. I loved this show since I first watched it in 05. Season 1 was the beginning of what is to be one of the best Teen sitcoms ever.,1348099200,,235,3.627450980392157
3503374,5,B001C0I61C,"Life with Derek is about two families, the Venturi's & the McDonald's, living together by parental marriage in the same house & accepting each other for who they are. The Alpha dogs of the household are Derek Venturi & Casey McDonald. The Omega dogs of the household are Edwin Venturi & Lizzie McDonald. The little princess is Marti Venturi. The parents of the pack are George Venturi & Nora McDonald. This is one of the better reality shows on Family Channel. This reality show actually mirrors the daily lifestyles & hardships that joined families face & overcome in North America. What makes this TV series so great is how they portray the power of family unity & defending each other from external tensions despite their inter-personal annoyances between family members.
The acting & performance of the actors & actresses is top notch. Storyline centres around the daily lifestyles of the characters from the household setting to a high school setting. The plot is well paced & well directed with very little dull moments. The dialogue of this reality series is well done since it mirrors your typical family sibling to family sibling, friend to friend, & boyfriend to girlfriend conversations. The genre is comedy but drama can also be tied into this popular TV series.
I recommend this TV series.
Thanks.",1287100800,,1310,4.932126696832579
3503375,5,B001C0I61C,I am an adult who loved this show when it was on air so I decided to purchase. Now my 6yr. old is enjoying all of the episodes and wants to watch every night. I guess now I will need to go ahead and purchase the other seasons. It is a great family show that includes good messages and laughs. All of the actors are absolutely wonderful. We love it!!!,1278460800,,350,4.014285714285714
3503376,5,B001C0I61C,This is the original Canadian Version not the heavily edited Disney Version the 1st season rocks luv the extras too cant wait to get the rest 2-4 plus the movie.,1267488000,2,161,4.4
3503377,5,B001C0I61C,"My siblings and I love this show. I'm disappointed to learn that Disney didn't release a few of the last episodes. They did however released the last one. Anyway, this show is one of my favorites on Disney channel and it's funny. I enjoy seeing ""Casey"" and her nerdish ways but it is too carried away. LOL! But I enjoy her character and ""Derek.""

There is just one thing I didn't like on this first season and that is the inappropriate talk the main characters had in a certain episodes. Other than that, the show is entertaining. :) That is why I give it 5 stars plus, I have good memories of getting this first season. :) This is just my opinion. :D",1253059200,,651,4.2926829268292686
3503378,5,B001C0I61C,This is a GREAT Family series enjoyed by all!. and the bllopers/comentary by each actor was really great too! Only wish they would make the rest of the seasons for all to enjoy on DVD sets!,1236124800,,189,4.277777777777778
8285422,5,B001C0I61C,This TV comedy from Canada is really enjoyable because it sees the humor in real life relationships.  This is one family you'll really be glad to know about.,1506988800,,157,4.607142857142857

8285425,3,B001C0I61C,"I caught this show randomly late night. very cute, comparable to any nickelodeon shows of the late 90s early 00s. When I bought this they didn't have any other seasons, I hope they came out with the rest!",1472428800,,204,4.394736842105263
