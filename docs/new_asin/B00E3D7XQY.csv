5886785,5,B00E3D7XQY,"An extraordinary film rendition of an extraordinary opera.  It reminded me of the Kirov's famous adaptation of ""Prince Igor"" to film, and of Glass' efforts to give an operatic libretto to classics such as ""The Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Dracula"" (both of which I saw at BAM).  The making a film out of opera takes away the concept of ""sets"" as static contraptions moved by machines.  Lipsynching does not bother me as long the the product is of superior quality.  By the way, I was not ""distracted"" by the goings on.  Better that that having to look at variations of a set and overweight singing statues who belt their arias looking like zombies.  I must remark, though, that the filming of operas in-house has improved the quality of operatic acting considerable.",1384560000,3,764,4.75
5886786,5,B00E3D7XQY,"Carl Maria von Weber's opera, ""Der Freischutz"" (The Marksman - the ""free-shooter"") takes its story from the end of the Napoleonic Wars; during Weber's lifetime. Originally, he envisioned this story as a version of an existing ""ghost tale"" by Johnann August Apel, ""The Hunter's Bride."" wherein the hero becomes a victim of fate. You don not need to know anything about Weber, Napoleon or the origins of the story to enjoy this captivating movie-opera.  This is truly one of the nicest opera films I have seen. Credit the director Jens Neubert and his brilliant Norwegian photo-director Harald Paalgard for producing a product that feels more like a film with singing than ""singing on film""  The locations and costumery feel totally authentic and there are many scenes that are genuinely beautiful to look at and give all the required senses of anticipation, fear, love and tension where required. The performances are top notch. The protoganists, Max and Kaspar are sung (and acted) brilliantly by Michael Volle and Michael Konig. Agathe as their object of competition is portrayed wonderfully by Juliane Banse. All other roles, large and small, are similarly performed very well. At the time of its premiere, ""Der Freischutz"" was a huge success for Weber for its colorful orchestrations and memorable ""tunes"" to mention the plot and setting which bore all the current events and elements of folk lore that especially rural Germans could relate to so well. The London Symphony and the Radio Chorus of Berlin anchor this production musically under the direction of Daniel Harding. The production values are quite high here. The visual acuity and sound clarity of this disc is terrific. Again, I highly recommend this to anyone who loves opera. This is truly one of the best film versions of an opera I have seen; it is truly beautiful.",1382400000,10,1833,5.026315789473684
5886787,2,B00E3D7XQY,"I had been looking forward to watching this, given the scarcity of even remotely traditional performances of Weber's masterpiece on DVD/Blu-ray. But what a disappointment! Director Neubert delights in drowning out the music with all kinds of background noises (in one case quite literally with a noisy downpour, which makes sure the charming waltz from the first act becomes inaudible). He never runs out of ideas here: stampeding horses, hyperactive children, stormy weather, giggling townsfolk etc. etc. all make sure we won't get distracted by the music.

The musical performance itself was rather good, on those rare occasions when one could actually hear it. The rather frequent gratuitous disgusting visual details did not add to my enjoyment.

Watch this before your next visit to the opera house. No amount of coughing in the audience will ever bother you again.",1380931200,10,870,5.251798561151079
5886788,5,B00E3D7XQY,"Considering the amount of pitfalls and difficulties inherent in making an opera film as opposed to making a recording of a live theatrical performance, it's not surprising that there are very few good films of this kind around.  Jens Neubert's film opera version of Der Freischtz is therefore a pleasant surprise, since it's an uncommonly performed but nonetheless important work of German opera, but also since it proves to be satisfying just as much as a film in its own right as it does as an opera.  With a superb cast and filming in authentic Saxony locations, this Der Freischtz actually feels more at home on film than it does on the modern opera stage.

There are several crucial elements that it is essential to get right in order for this to work on the screen.  Firstly, it's essential that the work doesn't look stagey and theatrical.  Despite the supernatural content of the opera's Gothic ghost story origins, Jens Neubert has a very clear focus that he successfully translates into a meaningful real-world context.  Recognising that the nature and outlook of the characters in Der Freischtz is shaped and determined very much by what was happening in the world in Weber's own time, Neubert updates the opera from the just after the Thirty Years War (1648) to the time of the composition of the work itself close to the end of the Napoleonic Wars, setting it in Dresden in 1813.

Max and Kasper then are here both soldiers in the army of King Friedrich August I of Saxony just after Napoleon's defeat in Russia.  If the relationship to those sentiments and the war isn't clear enough, it's emphasised brilliantly in the Wolf's Gorge scene. Here, when Kasper summons Zamiel the Black Hunter to forge a ""free bullet"" that will ensure Max's victory in the hunting contest, the rocky gorge is filled with the bodies of dead soldiers, some of them dragged over to form a grim pentagram.  The supernatural element consequently takes on a very real and sinister aspect.  That's not to say that the director neglects what are after all the essential Gothic qualities of the work, using special visual effects where necessary and mixing in sound effects.

Most importantly, Neubert has assembled a superb cast for his film, with Michael Knig, Juliane Banse, Michael Volle, Ren Pape and fresh talent in Regula Mhlemann.  It's an outstanding cast that is not only well-suited to this type of German Classical/Romantic-era opera, but they all have good screen presence and can act well.  It's a very different kind of acting skill that is required here where there is singing involved and it's not so easy to achieve either within the context of this work's supernatural elements.  There are however no theatrical mannerisms here whatsoever, every performance pitched perfectly for the requirements of the camera close-up and in terms of the very real historical setting of the work.  The audio is of course necessarily studio recorded and then lip-synced for filming, but this works very well.

On Blu-ray, presenting the film at its aspect ratio of 2.35:1, the film looks marvellous in High Definition.  The DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 track is also well worth mentioning, the director going to great length to create what he calls a kind of ""3-D"" presence that incorporates and balances the music and the natural sound effects.  A PCM stereo option is also available.  There are numerous extra features, including a 'Making Of' that is almost an hour long, a full-length Director's Commentary, Interviews and a Synopsis.  Further information on the production and a Q&A with the director is also printed on the booklet attached to the inside cover of the digipak case.  Subtitles are provided in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean.  These can only be selected from the pop-up menu when the film is playing, or from the BD player's remote control.",1378771200,11,3865,4.932098765432099
8600541,5,B00E3D7XQY,This is an outstanding production. The highest priority is given to the music - performance and sound quality are superb. Attention to detail and outstanding photography make this a stunning performance. I only wish there were a lot more efforts like this.,1449273600,,256,5.119047619047619
8600542,5,B00E3D7XQY,"Opera lovers have always stated that opera encompass various art forms. This film opera just shows that the art of filming can also be part of the art forms that make opera great. Producing a film opera allows for interpretations and expressions that are not possible on the stage opening new creativity capabilities. This film opera is very well done, with a clear interpretation. The music, orchestra and excellent singers are of very high quality, as is the recording sound. One interesting aspect of filming an opera is the sound combination of the music, orchestra and signers, with the noises available on a film like falling stones, wind, steps over fallen leaves, etc.  I am sure there are many opinions on what the best mix should be, depending on personal preferences.  Every new technology, when applied to art, allows for exploration of new possibilities, and creates new dilemmas. For this film opera, I found the sound combination appropriate and enhancing the overall experience.
The magic aspects of Der Freischutz have never been easy to stage. This film allows a much easier portrayal of magic without being overwhelming while keeping the human aspects on the forefront.
I strongly recommend this film to every opera lover, and to those who have not watched this opera before. You will be surprised how many arias you will recognize from casual listening.",1409616000,2,1373,5.044052863436123
8600543,3,B00E3D7XQY,"This is truly beautiful, beautifully filmed and done and sung, but the liner's stated emphasis on making this a cinematic experience explains why there is so much non-singing in it.  Now I am not greatly familiar with how much of Weber's opera is  spoken dialogue, but I feel not so much as there is here.  I would like to see a staging before making a final judgement on this DVD, but, for now, I find the whole less than the sum of its parts.",1397088000,,444,4.261904761904762
8600544,5,B00E3D7XQY,"A beautiful opera, undeservedly overlooked, here presented in a compelling cinematic format, and beautifully sung. The cast is superb, with fine acting, too.",1395446400,,157,5.869565217391305
8600545,1,B00E3D7XQY,"This production suffocates Weber's opera. Yes, the story has always been a little thin and goofy, but the music is wonderful. In this production, though, the story and music are crushed by the director's ""artistic"" pretensions. The constant groveling in the dirt by the male leads is pointless and tiresome. Did any men in this era ever wash their hair or themselves?

Save your money, and just enjoy any of the fine recordings available.",1392854400,4,438,4.918918918918919
8600546,5,B00E3D7XQY,"This is what a filmed opera should be -- vibrant, wide dynamic range, beautifully set.  You hear the sound of artillery, wagon wheels going by, laughter, sounds of peasants at work and play because that is what the opera is about.  Staged opera strives to incorporate some of that into its presentation, but is limited.  Filmed opera, however, can carefully mix the soundtrack so you get wind as a backdrop to emotional turmoil, thunder to signal something ominous, laughter to enhance an intimate duet, giving it a very personal touch.  Close ups render a chamber opera feel while pans give one the feel of sitting back in the mezzanine, taking in the whole of it.  The singing is excellent and the orchestra is quite fine.  Someone else wrote that the music was fine when you could hear it over the sound effects and I honestly don't know what they were talking about.  If having an opera come alive is too distracting, it is best to stick to a studio recording.  But this production is well designed and well executed.  I'm grateful for the chance to experience it.",1390089600,4,1068,4.668449197860962
8600547,4,B00E3D7XQY,"This is a DVD consisting of a film production of the opera Der Freischutz  The Marksman, featuring a dynamite cast  including Rene Pape as the Hermit.  The choral work is amazing, and as the liner notes indicate, over two years was spent casting this film.  Over 600 people were employed in the Dresden area during the making of this film, which was shot in 35mm.  Kudos goes to Juliane Banse, for her wonderful vocal work and very believable acting.  Shes a delight.

It should be noted that this is not a film of an opera production  rather, it is a film of the opera singers acting and singing in the production.  While I enjoyed the story itself (particularly the bullet fabrication scene with the special effects available to a current film maker), I had trouble not being distracted by the fact that the operatic singing seemed to not quite match the singing I was seeing on screen.  They weren't out of sync  not at all  but I could tell that what I was hearing did not exactly correspond to what I was seeing.  As it turns out, the singing was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London and then matched with the film.  And while it is matched really well, it took me a while to get past that.  All that being said, the music is *wonderful*.

The liner notes are informative, and give background on Webers life and the creation of the work.  There is also a question and answer section in the booklet that is illuminating about the process of putting together the film and what the director was trying to accomplish.  This is a solid, enjoyable film, and is definitely worth seeing even if you haven't seen the opera before in person.",1388534400,3,1640,4.501694915254237
8600548,5,B00E3D7XQY,"I really enjoyed this.  I have seen most of available opera movie combinations (as contrasted with filmed stage performances) and I rank it up there with the Domingo-Migenes Carmen.  It has a cast, quite comparable in quality to that on the 1968 Rolf Liebermann Freischtz but blows it away sonically and visually with the use of recent technology.  I have never heard horns recorded better.  The Wolf's Glen scene is enough to give you goose flesh.  My opinion is based on the dts-HD 5.1 Master Audio track on the blu-ray.  I think that this movie has had only a very limited run in theaters so I would have preferred a full screened 16:9 to the 2:35:1 we get here with the large bands at top and bottom.  Director Jens Neubert's commentary track adds to the overall value of the disc.  I don't find him all that convincing with his arguments for changing the name of the opera to the original Jgersbraut and moving the setting to the Napoleonic wars of Weber's time from the original 17th century Thirty Years war.  However he was very good on explaining how he chose the cast and directed and filmed the performance.  Very strongly recommended.",1386979200,4,1146,4.656716417910448
8600549,5,B00E3D7XQY,"Fo those who know the music, this is a wonderful way of getting to hear and see Weber's best opera.",1386806400,,99,4.0
8600550,4,B00E3D7XQY,"Despite some criticisms of operas put into  a film format, this rendering proved to be admirable.  The singing quality was not hindered, and the sets were actually palaces.  Furthermore, the singers did show ""warts and all.""  The music was superb.",1386633600,,247,5.1
