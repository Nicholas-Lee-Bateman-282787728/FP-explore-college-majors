1685248,4,B000062XEC,"This workout, like it's cousin Lower Body Split is a good hour plus workout full of upper body work and then some.  It is compiled from several Firm videos, Fat Blaster, Better Body and Buns, Maximum Body shaping, Firm Cardio, Firm Strength, Maximum Cardio, Cardio Burn, Power Cardio, Tortoise and some rare footage from Prime Power Fat Burning, which is out of print and hard to find.  While the scenery in the Firm workouts is not appealing to everyone, the footage from Prime Power will stick out like a sore thumb, it is a jungle set as opposed to the mansion or library sets which are more familiar to Firm viewers.

You will work all the muscles in your upper body (chest, biceps, triceps, shoulders, back) in this workout, plus you will get some cardio and ab work too.  A fanny lifter or stool is used, plus you will need light, medium and heavy weights, a barbell is used but is not required, dumbells are easily substituted.  Here is a breakdown of the exercises and the video they originally came from...

warmup - Maximum Cardio

abs with breathwork - Better Body/Buns

front kicks/punches, one arm lat rows - Prime Power Fat Burning

4 limb aerobics w/light weights - Firm Cardio

pushups, double arm lat rows, hover squats with power breathing -Prime Power Fat Burning

pushups, pec flies, pelvic floor work - Tortoise

abs - Cardio Burn

hi-lo aerobics (some plyo jumps) - Fat Blaster

plies w/upright rows, military press - Maximum Body Shaping

front/side deltoid raises - Maximum Body Shaping

one arm lat rows, tricep kickbacks, bicep curls - Tortoise

pushups, bicep concentration curls, tricep kickbacks - Prime Power Fat Burning

hi-lo aerobics with ball - Maximum Cardio

rear deltoid raises - Maximum Body Shaping

abs/oblique work - Better Body/Buns

one arm lat rows, tricep kickbacks, bicep curls - Tortoise

planks, pushups, spinal erector work - Fat Blaster

abs/oblique work - Power Cardio

front/side deltoid raises, plyo jumps - Cardio Burn

one arm lat rows, upright rows - Firm Strength

oblique twists - Maximum Body Shaping

cooldown/stretch - Maximum Cardio

If you have time, this isn't a bad upper body workout, not everyone will have an hour to devote to only upper body though.  I personally would have preferred they left the cardio portions out of it to shorten it up a bit, but that is just a personal preference.  There is a scene index that you can skip sections if you want.  There is also a bonus training program ""Form Points"" which shows proper form of the exercises which is helpful.",1131840000,16,2534,4.796296296296297
1685249,4,B000062XEC,"This DVD gives you a good upper body workout and the repetition of sets is dispersed throughout the session, so you might do a couple sets of bicep curls early in the workout, and then do another couple of sets later. I like that.
From the description on the box, this looked like a single workout taught by alternating instructors, but it's really a video remix of several different workouts spanning the years. You can tell the editors tried to make it flow well, but even with the slick transitions, it remains a ""Franken-workout,"" pieced together from snippets of other workouts. It lacks overall flow, and often there's not enough time to set up the equipment.
Despite the flaws, the workout itself is excellent. I find The Firm philosophy of working with several pieces of equipment to be quite effective. I don't mind swapping items into and out of the workspace frequently (it keeps me interested). If you're not into this, though, beware: there's a lot of setup and breakdown (and like I mentioned, you must work fairly quickly to keep up)
The back of the DVD lists an impressive array of necessities, but you can get by with:
- Fanny Lifter or 14-18 inch step/bench/stool
- Light dumbbells
- Medium dumbbells
- Heavy dumbbells
Optional equipment listed:
- Weight ball (i just used a 5-lb dumbbell)
- Sculpting Stick (used very briefly - you can skip, or use a cheap dowel)
- 2x4 board (didn't use at all during workout; can put below heels on certain floor work or squats if you want to go deeper)
- Barbell (i have no idea where they wanted you to use this; maybe in place of the sculpting stick?)
This delivers as promised, despite its flaws: a concentrated session of upper body work plus abs. It's definitely not for raw beginners -- it's quite intense, but adaptable (just change to lighter or heavier weights if you find you're having trouble). I will laugh at the '80s workout clothes and hair. I'll cringe at the cheesy music. I'll curse the lithe instructors breezily commanding me to to just two more sets of pushups. And I'll keep doing these things, because, overall, it's a fun and effective workout.",1088035200,24,2123,4.679144385026738
1685250,4,B000062XEC,"This is really a great upper body work-out. It is sometimes a bit confusing though, with very (too) short intervals in between exercises, which you really have to get used too.",1078012800,7,176,4.709677419354839
1685251,5,B000062XEC,"When I purchased this DVD I really didn't think an Upper Body workout would be challenging enough and not to mention that I didn't believe it was 60 minutes.  Well The Firm does it again - this compilation was an excellent mix from previous workouts, it WAS 61 minutes and very challenging.  Ab work was split into different segments interspersed throughout the workout and you ended up with 15 minutes of Ab work.  Heart-rate was kept up and the tape made me ""sweat"".  Definately worked all my upper body parts.  Definately recommend this workout - - and hope the FIRM hurries up with more work-outs on DVD!!",1027123200,39,609,4.654205607476635

7957999,5,B000062XEC,"If you want a great upper body workout with cardio and abs, this is it! It's a longer workout, so be prepared to sweat! Cardio segments are low impact, which is great if you knee/joint issues. Make sure you have a range of weights for work with dumbbells. (3-15lbs) Combine this with ""Lower Body Split"" (although not on same day!) for a truly complete whole body workout.",1497916800,2,371,4.552238805970149

7958002,5,B000062XEC,"This is  great upper body workout. I rotate between the Upper Body Split and Lower Body Split DVDs. And to keep it challenging, I add weights as I get stronger. Love that I get a cardio workout too.",1400371200,3,198,4.2105263157894735
7958003,5,B000062XEC,"These are serious workouts.  I have Upper Body and Lower Body plus other Firm tapes.  These are totally tough...You will know you are working out.  No doubt.
I'm 59 and I don't do the jumping but everything else.  I love the Firm Tapes.  They are the only ones that don't get boring to me or just get on your nerves.  I'm glad to add these to my library.",1350000000,7,354,4.132352941176471
7958004,3,B000062XEC,"I bought this looking for a challenging upper body workout.  It is a challenging workout, especially for the abs, BUT there is a real lack of variety in the upper body excercises.  There are lots of pushups, lots of lat rows, lots of tricep kick backs.  That's about it, though.  If I didn't already own it, I'd say buy Upper Body Sculpt instead.  It's shorter and packs just as much of a wallop.",1214784000,8,396,4.36986301369863
7958005,2,B000062XEC,There are too many trainers in this DVD. You really don't have time to change position until they already began workout. It is too complicated and workouts are kind of old looking.,1168300800,2,180,4.65625
7958006,5,B000062XEC,"I live in Italy and I didn't know the Firm items that I find fantastic.

I use daily in my workout. I thank you very much.",1163376000,2,122,3.6923076923076925
7958007,2,B000062XEC,"After using various DVDs from different eras of The Firm, it was weird using this one. It felt very 80s and many of the exercises were repetitive. Plus, there's kind of bad music and the microphone dangling above the leader all the time, which makes it seem cheesy.

That said, it was a challenging workout, but I had a lot of problems with aesthetics and some of the 80s-style moves.",1156636800,3,384,4.485714285714286
