8656678,5,B00K7P609I,"Underbelly NZ: Land of the Long Green Cloud deeply explores Mr Asia, Christopher Martin Johnstone and his drug importation empire from 1972 to 1980. Interestingly, Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities included the likes of Terry Clark and touched on Johnstone, but the Kiwi instalment of the franchise examines Johnstone from beginning to end, which provides an absorbing narrative. The efforts of New Zealands police to bring Johnstone to justice continually gets hampered by his slippery criminal knowhow, yet members of Johnstones closest business council present a far greater threat to his realm than the law.
