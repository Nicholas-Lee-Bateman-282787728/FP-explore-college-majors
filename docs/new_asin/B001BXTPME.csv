8285155,3,B001BXTPME,"This is a typical A&E Biography program, but it is ONLY 44 Minutes .... the traditional length of a 1 hour broadcast NOT 100 minutes as they show on Amazon.com which is closer to the 2 hour program length. I was very disappointed when it arrived and was less than HALF of the promised duration.  Suffice to say , it is quite an abbreviation to try and cover this mans' life in 44 minutes.... hence my middling rating.  And this is more infuriating because this is a DVD R made to order through Amazon itself!",1440547200,,508,4.336842105263158
8285156,1,B001BXTPME,"Nothing new in this thin bio. Your better off buying  ""Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride and ""Gonzo The Life and Work of Hunter S. Thompson"".
Do not buy the bio, it sucks!",1253145600,4,167,4.0606060606060606
