8702422,2,B00TP127G0,"A Tale of Winter is about a woman in search of love. Not just any love, but the kind that leaves one feeling just the right away about oneselfa form of self-love, it might be said. The search for an idealized image of the self in another.  She has three men in mind who might fit the bill:  An intellectual named Loic, her hairstylist Max, and the former summer fling Charles.  This is a theme which Rohmer plays on in many of his films:  The indecisive dreamer, idealist, romantic, the sensitive type who isn't quite sure what he or she is after but definitely knows when it hasn't been found.  Some counterparts would be Delphine in The Green Ray, Gaspard in A Summers Tale, and to a lesser extent Jeanne in A Tale of Springtime.

The difference is that the characters found in these other films all have some redeeming quality to thema certain naivet or charm or good-heartedness which enables us to overlook or understand their unwillingness to compromise in their relationships.  Felicie, the young woman in A Tale of Winter, has none of these qualities.  She is above all a frivolous woman, which we learn in the candid discussions that take place between her and her sister.  A woman preoccupied with the shape of her nose.  A woman who thinks it of the utmost importance that her daughter know that her father was a handsome man.  A woman who confounds physicality with love and continues to pine for the statuesque but unambitious Charles years after their fling.  Though she has two men in her life who love her unconditionally, she cannot love them enough to be able to live with them. Loic is an egghead who makes her feel diminished with his discussions about Pascal and Plato.  Max has the brawn she desires but doesnt quite approximate the thrill of Charles.

With most of Rohmers films, there is usually at least one character who is endearing in some way.  A character who reaffirms ones faith in humanity.  In Pauline at the Beach, there is the equally frivolous Marion who rejects the bitter romantic Pierre for the lecherous Henria cast of very flawed characters whose shortcomings are brought into stark relief by the grounded, sensible 15-year-old Pauline (a role Amanda Langlet reprises in her 20s as Margot in A Summers Tale).  Here, however, there is nobody to really identify with or care about.  Loic, despite his obvious intellect, seems oblivious to the lack of chemistry between the two and strangely apathetic about the whole affair.  Max, though visibly hurt and angry by Felicies rejection, likewise quietly resigns himself to the situation. Both are middling men in their middle years who seem to have lost the ability to feel.  Felicie is the feeling one, but its a very shallow, visceral, self-absorbed sort of feeling.  There just isn't anything to aspire to or to feel good about here as there is in many of Rohmers other works.

Unlike those other works, which are mostly set in sunny beachside settings, A Tale of Winter is composed almost entirely of gritty urban scenes.  Lots of shots on buses with sad-looking faces, stooped, atomized individuals weighed down by oversized winter clothing.  At one point we are treated to a lovers stroll down Rue Casse-Cou (breakneck street), past a door decorated with what looks to be an antisemitic graffito.  Someone should have told Rohmer that winter neednt be so dreary and nihilistic.

If one is new to Rohmer, this would definitely not be a good place to start.  The film which best approximates the general idea of this one would probably be A Summers Tale, which is infinitely better.  Apart from the musings on immortality (Platos notion of recollection) and the play-within-a-play (Shakespeares Winters Tale, which this one patterns itself on), there isn't much to hold the interest here.",1525132800,,3779,4.826086956521739

8702426,5,B00TP127G0,"Eric Rohmer (1920  2010) was a genius, a director who was able to make combustible films that leave traces on our minds like the romances in this particular film. A TALE OF WINTER is one of the four seasons quadrant of films that hold him in very high esteem among cinema buffs. Thanks to the efforts of Big World Pictures it is now available on DVD.

Felicie (Charlotte Vry) and Charles (Frdric van den Driessche) have a serious if whirlwind holiday romance. Due to a mix-up on addresses they lose contact, and five years later at Christmas-time Felicie is a hairdresser living with her mother in a cold Paris with a daughter (from Charles) as a reminder of that long-ago summer. For male companionship she oscillates between hairdresser Maxence (Michel Voletti) and the intellectual Loic (Herv Furic), but seems unable to commit to either as the memory of Charles and what might have been hangs over everything. The plot centers on Flicies shifting allegiances to the three men in her life, with an abortive move to another city, a strange experience in the cathedral of Nevers, and a performance of Shakespeares The Winters Tale among the stations on a roundabout journey that finally brings her face to face with the most basic issues of destiny and faith.

Rohmer gently guides us through the portals of love in all its forms and few can match his gifts. Making this film widely available is a true gift. Grady Harp, July 15",1436054400,,1429,4.730923694779117
8702427,5,B00TP127G0,"Saw this movie many years ago, and I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD. Finally did this year and I bought it immediately. Love Rohmer and love this film.",1433894400,,162,4.09375
8702428,5,B00TP127G0,"This ""small"" movie is actually very big, and perfectly rendered. It earns its relation to Shakespeare's ""A Winter's Tale"" through its deep exploration loss and its antagonist, faith. Your capacity for doubt will be tasked by this film; your wish to reduce faith to romanticism will be challenged. These are big arguments, in any life; the deepest arguments of the soul, we might say. Rohmer is fully up to them, and makes a film apparently about life as we live it that wrestles with them. How do we enter such a serious moral world? Just by living. Rohmer's thought is that  moral issues cannot be escaped. But happiness--true happiness--can be found, right here, right on this earth. Unexpectedly. This movie is a masterpiece. Or, if you like your praise small: a gem. In any case, one of the movies on the must-see list.",1429833600,3,823,4.755244755244755
