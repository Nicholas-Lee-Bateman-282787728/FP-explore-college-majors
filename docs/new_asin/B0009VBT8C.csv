8362386,4,B0009VBT8C,"If you like the more flowing, yet practical styles of Tai Chi chuan then you will like this form. The movements have all you'd need for a nice, complete Tai Chi chuan work-out. It has all the twists and flow that any good Chi-Kung form would have as well, so I'd say it is good as a Chi Kung as well. It is not Shao-lin chuan or Chen style. you could spice it up a bit if you prefer more flash. It also does not even resemble Yang style really, but for my taste, with slight adjustment on the kicks, it is quite nice.",1359590400,,517,3.980769230769231
8362387,5,B0009VBT8C,"Tai-chi Tiger Form is a very fluid series of movements - one of the Tai-chi forms based on a specific animal.  Unlike the Shaolin tiger forms, this one is flowing and twisting, like the movements of a tiger.  It emphasizes the sequential rotation of the joints.  The form is shown from different angles and speeds and there are detailed, step by step instructions and self defense applications for each movement. There is also a section on tiger chi-gung.  The results of practicing this form are increased range of motion of the joints, more control of each muscle, development of internal energy (chi), increased elasticity of the connective tissue such as ligaments and tendons and, especially if practiced at the fast speed, a lot of exercise.  As far as I know this is the only available program on this form.",1300233600,,814,4.827338129496403
8362388,5,B0009VBT8C,"This is a beautiful animal form of Tai-chi.  Many people do not realize that Tai-chi has animal forms or that each movements of the forms trains you in self defense.  This DVD provides complete instructions for this form and the self defense applications.  The movements are sinuous, the way any member of the cat family fights.  The form emphasizes the sequential rotation of all the joints of the body so that the body writhes and twists as cats do.  A type of ""tiger chi-gung"" is also taught that trains the body to move in this way.  It is an incredible program.",1147824000,8,566,4.554455445544554
