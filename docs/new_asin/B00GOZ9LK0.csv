8625938,5,B00GOZ9LK0,"The devilishly charming Robson Green presents an educational program about his home county of Northumberland. Green explores natural and historical landmarks and interviews local experts making for a very interesting, informative show. Many of the guests (and the host) reflect on the culture of the northeast and share their memories. It's almost a shame this is only DVD quality instead of blu-ray because of the sweeping shots of gorgeous landscapes, starry night skies, and Robson Green posing.
Please remember this is a region 2 PAL DVD that will not play in most US DVD players.",1455926400,9,584,5.157894736842105
