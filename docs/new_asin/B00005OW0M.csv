7949406,4,B00005OW0M,"This DVD and all of the pride dvd's is worth a buy.
The supplemental stuff is weak, and unfortunately it's the same on all the pride DVD's. So once you've seen it once, thats that!!.
However the fighting, the fighters and the prodcution are top notch. It's not just blood and guts it's style and panache, check out Sakuraba, unbelievable.",1055894400,,338,4.65

7949408,5,B00005OW0M,"Overall a very good show. I like the real fights at streetbrawls.com Sakuraba fights well, and show glimpses of what lies in the future for him, as does Renzo with an impressive performance.
The only downside is the Kerr fight, with some boring tactics from Branco.
Overall a good show, and well worth watching",1005782400,2,310,4.7592592592592595
7949409,3,B00005OW0M,"Firstly I would recommend any DVD featuring Marco Ruas (with the exception of UFC 21 v. Maurice Smith), and his fight against Goodridge does not disappoint, with both fighters putting up a good showing.
