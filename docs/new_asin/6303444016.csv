William Hurt does a great job at narating this video.  His voice seems perfect for some reason.  The film does a good job of capturing how almost desperate Albert was to learn and teach as much as possible before he died.  He was truly in love with the miracle that is life.  I also found it interesting how he was influenced by Ghandi, and his ideas on passive resistance.  Check out Einstein's ""Essays on Humanism.""  I highly recommend it.",1131062400,2,614,4.5
7847038,2,6303444016,"PBS really missed an opportunity to present a great story.  Although we found the content to be informative and fastinating, we had to stop watching halfway through because of the horrid overriding ""music"" that accompanied most of the oral discussion. It was aweful!  We'll try the Nova production to learn more about Albert Einstein.",1116633600,,334,5.166666666666667
7847039,4,6303444016,"Einstein's science is not addressed from a technical standpoint in this video,as should be evident from the title.  The title is a play on the title of Einstein's book, ""The World As I See It"" which is NOT a  science book but rather philosophical writings.  I enjoyed this portrayal  of Einstein's evolution as an activist.  There are many wonderful old film  clips included.  I think this video is a must for any person interesting in  knowing Einstein the person.",946339200,14,465,4.7974683544303796
