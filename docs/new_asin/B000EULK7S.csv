2535135,2,B000EULK7S,"Mystic Force is a mess of a show. This DVD proves that.

Mystic Force suffers from two problems: its pacing and its actors, the latter of which is a very serious problem. This cast is quite simply the weakest cast Disney has ever put together for Power Rangers. It lacks almost everything previous seasons did so well; with Ninja Storm, Dino Thunder and SPD, you felt that it was a group of friends that connected well with each other. You saw them enjoying each other's company. With Mystic Force, you're pretty much told they're friends, and you don't actually see the characters ""hang out"" like buddies.

On-top of that, the acting is really bad. Terribly bad, in the case of Angie Diaz (Vida) and Nic Sampson (Chip), who always seem to force their lines out of their throats. There's no flow in how they deliver themselves - a good example of this is the third episode, Code Breakers, where Vida and Chip try to do good deed in order to gain more power. It's a brilliant concept for an episode, but is completely spoilt by Diaz and Sampson, who play almost every line with too much enthusiasm. It doesn't sell the story one bit, and comes off as false. And both Vida and Chip ruin the scenes where Madison, a filmmaker, is filming her friends - Vida is a DJ, and she does this really cringe-worthy MC dance when she's on Madison's camera, exclaiming ""yeah, wicked, yeah"". It's really unbearable. On-top of that, Chip jumps around when Madison films him, knocking things over with no consideration of others. I know his character is meant to be childish to some degree, but not even a 12 year old would act the way Chip does.

The other problem is pacing - it's far too rushed in places, like the zord fights, and over-played in others (Episode Three's bike-fight is the worst offender). However, Mystic Force has some good aspects to it. The opening scene to the first episode has an impressive battle sequence, and it's great eye-candy. The show also has really good fight sequences, both original and Japanese (where the show originates from). Another good thing is the show hits the nail with its Nick, Madison, Xander, Udonna and Clare characters. They all seem natural, although Nick does seem a little weak for the Red Ranger position.

In conclusion, Mystic Force Volume 1 isn't nearly as good as previous seasons, and is definately a mixed bag. Where as last year's show started great and turned sour, this show has started poor. Perhaps it will develop into something great by Volume 2.",1141776000,12,2499,4.672727272727273

8114472,5,B000EULK7S,"Power Rangers Mystic Force. What can I say about it? It's certainly not the best Season of Power Rangers, however, it isn't the worst either.

Younger children will enjoy this series movie I think. It's kind of gives a ""Harry Potter"" feeling, with the Rangers' magic wands and capes. Volume 1 is the best of the Mystic Force releases. The first two episodes show how the Rangers become the Mystic Force. The only thing I found to complain about were the lack of episodes. This DVD only has 3 Mystic Force episodes. However, they do include a bonus episode from Power Rangers SPD intitled History, which shows the team-up between the SPD Rangers and Dino Rangers from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.

--Episode List:
Broken Spell (Part 1)
Broken Spell (Part 2)
Code Busters

8114473,4,B000EULK7S,"This dvd shows how the Mystic Force Power Rangers first met and gained their powers, The special effects are alot better than earlier series of Power Rangers, but still have plenty of room for improvement although young children don't seem to mind. It has more of a medieval/fairytale feel to it than any other power rangers series with wands,dragons and witch/wizard type characters. My children and I have enjoyed watching it and look forward to watching the rest of the series.",1178928000,,480,4.938271604938271

The special effects are the best the show has seen yet, and the music is fantastic.  The actors chosen for mystic force are probably the worst the show has had.",1149724800,,289,4.236363636363636

Mystic Force is real good it's even better power rangers S.P.D. I like all the Magic that they do.
