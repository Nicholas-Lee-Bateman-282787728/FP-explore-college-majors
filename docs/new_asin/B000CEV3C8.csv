8098524,5,B000CEV3C8,I love this movie!  The quality of the film was decent.  Do not expect high def for this.  One thing I didn't like is that the scenes were dark making it hard to see at times.  The story is beautiful and always brings tears to the eyes.,1486339200,,236,3.9574468085106385

8098526,5,B000CEV3C8,"This movie is probably one of the greatest stories of men being able to overcome tragedy. After this 19th century Doctor's wife leaves him , taking his child, he loses his will to live. This is actually a story of redemption , including all the elements of a great movie, from romance to tragedy. You really have to see it to understand it. The music is also really well done! Unfortunately, im not sure who wrote it. I will write a more thorough review on ""the order of the iron phoenix"" -- but in all honesty : buy it and watch it! It truly is a classic!",1370822400,2,556,4.205607476635514
8098527,4,B000CEV3C8,"I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for years. This is my favorite Polish movie. A prestigious surgeon is losing his memory and becomes a quack in the 1920s. The acting is simply amazing. If you like European movies such as Manon of the Spring / Jean de Florette (French), you'll love this one.
  Just last year I purchased a brand new VHS tape from the same studio (Polart). The video quality is quite bad and the colors disappear during some early scenes. This new DVD is quite an improvement, although it still is in a 4:3 Full screen aspect ratio. Colors are vivid. Optional English subtitles are available.",1138838400,10,627,4.539823008849558
