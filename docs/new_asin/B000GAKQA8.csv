8280806,1,B000GAKQA8,"Let the buyer beware:  Dick Tracy (Volume 1-3) is in reality only the first three chapters of the 1937 serial.  There is nothing on the DVD box that alerts the unwitting customer to this fact, nor on the Amazon page for that matter - the website even displays ""1950"" quite prominently... and inaccurately.  Note the distributor uses ""Volume"" instead of ""Chapter"" on the front of the box - while the back promises ""action-packed stories"" - there is nothing to inform the potential buyer of the true nature of the product.  Based on the information provided, I assumed I was getting several episodes of the Dick Tracy TV series.  Silly me.

Not only does the distributor pull a ""bait and switch"" but the print used to make this DVD is awful.  One can't expect a public demand product to have the same quality as those released by the original studio, but this print is bad by even public domain standards.  Even at $4.95, it's overpriced, especially when you consider that you'd have to purchase three other DVDs to complete the serial.  You can purchase all twelve chapters as part of a 150 episode Mill Creek box set of serials for pennies a chapter.",1197590400,4,1150,4.653465346534653
