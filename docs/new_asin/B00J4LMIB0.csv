6333239,2,B00J4LMIB0,"In a single blast of white light, eighty people are transported to a strange place. A voice tells them that they have been chosen to be part of a race. If they move off the path onto the grass, they will die. If they get lapped twice, they will die. If they don't follow the arrows, they will die. The house, the prison, and the school are safe locations. Who will win? What's going on? How will this change who the people are and how they deal with others?

Ignore the shoe-string budget. The makers do the best they can with what they've got, and it's not too bad, even if the film quickly starts to feel like the writer/director/editor came up with it only because he just discovered how to use his CGI software to make blood explode everywhere. If you have a problem with giant bubbles of the sticky red liquid popping everywhere, then avoid this film at all costs, because it goes back to that well over and over again with disgusting regularity.

A curious little sci-fi flick with an intriguing premise, the movie fails most because of its bankrupt morality and the uneven way it spools itself out. Although there are a lot of people involved in the race -- an elderly man with a walker, a crazed homeless woman, a pregnant lady, some street toughs, two young Asian siblings -- the film focuses mainly on two deaf friends and two ex-military buddies, one of them missing a leg. It is in these two couples that we get the whole ""what makes us good or bad?"" message that's become pretty rote for films of this ilk. Yes, in stressful, life-or-death situations, people tend to show their true colors or whatever. However, the message here is watered down not just because it's become cliche for movies, but also because the excessive supernatural element of the story (when people break the rules of the race, their heads pop like ticks that have mined an artery) kinda negates the whole philosophical concept of what makes us good or bad deep inside.

And, boy oh boy, is that ever hammered home. The first ten minutes of the movie are basically a bait-and-switch designed to show the audience that the movie isn't going to follow normal rules of storytelling. That is: anything can happen here. And, sure, there is a lot of grotesque shock-for-shock's-sake stuff in here, some of it so over-the-top that it is more laughable than horrifying (I refer back to the Asian siblings and the pregnant lady). But this is where the unevenness comes into play. Because the characters are running over the same paths, over and over again, the plot feels like it does the exact same thing, returning over and over to the themes of humanity, sacrifice, determination, and good vs. bad, with none of it -- again, like the characters -- really marking any new ground.

If the first ten minutes could've been cut, so could the last ten minutes, where the audience is spoonfed a resolution that is so cheesy that it makes you wonder why the filmmakers bothered. Not to give too much away, ""boredom"" is the answer to everything, and thus it is the end result. Although there are some half-decent stabs at CGI solutions that I respect even if I don't value, it would've been a lot better had the filmmakers banked on the inherent uncertainty of the story. Instead, way too much is given away. Like a magician who reveals the secrets behind his best tricks, the result isn't awe but the cheap sense that someone just tried to pull a fast one. As a result, in spite of the decent acting, filming, editing, and workable special effects, the whole story ends up feeling like kind of a rip off.",1399680000,,3575,4.58125
6333240,4,B00J4LMIB0,"A group of about 80 people suddenly appear on a sidewalk and must compete in a race or die. There are rules to this race, ones that must be followed, or you die...such as no stepping on the grass. If you are lapped twice, you also die. In an attempt to keep people alive several came up with the idea that everyone stay inside a house and not run. However true to society, or the human race, one person starts running, so everyone must now run. The film was in part, designed to look at the human race in this microcosm as competition vs. cooperation. We see the best and worse come out in us as things degrade to a free-for-all.

The question they raise is ""why"" which is one the viewer must endure also. The clues are minor. Any seasoned film watcher would have the reason on their short list. The film ended leaving itself open for a sequel. The main problem with the film is that it took too long to get to the end. Things got boring as we waited for an answer. The main character acting was good. Trista Robinson and Eddie McGee were convincing.

This is not a film for everyone. Decent rental. 3 1/2 stars

As you might guess, it's definitely dark - and I think would have been better with some dark humor thrown in, as it tends to be pretty unrlentingly heavy throughout - but not pointlessly so.

But this is nothing like the short novel that I couldn't put down till it was over. This idea had a lot of potential at the beginning. You could have come up with any number of scenarios that would have put these 80 people in a race for their lives. But in the end, all you get is some entertaining blood and gore, a really disturbing scene with the death of a pregnant woman that should have been left out entirely (and that's coming from someone who has no trace of delicate sensibilities), and an end that is unsatisfying.

At the end of the day, we get one character that's a halfway decent human being but boring, and the rest are terrible people.....that we still don't much care about.

6333256,1,B00J4LMIB0,"When I rented ""The Human Race,"" I was expecting something along the lines of Stephen King's novella ""The Long Walk"" judging by the summary on the product page. Instead, I got something completely different, and not in a good way. Simply put, the people who wrote and directed this had no idea what they wanted their film to be.

This is evident in the first ten minutes. Just like Ed Wood peppered his infamous ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" with random scenes of Bela Lugosi, the audience is treated to a completely insignificant back story about a young woman battling cancer. This goes on and on, only to end with no particular connection to the plot whatsoever. Perhaps the filmmakers are trying to show the existential ridiculousness of mankind's small victories over death or something. But the simplest explanation is the best: they have no idea how to make a movie. Either that, or they filmed a short years ago and decided ""let's tack the whole thing onto this full-length production."" Another back story crops up with a bit more significance to the overall plot, but it could have been handled in a one-minute flashback.

The relatively simple premise -- a group of ordinary people forced to participate in some daunting competition until only one is left standing -- was somehow made overly convoluted and completely stilted in its execution. Again, I think this comes down to a production team that slapped a bunch of incongruous ideas together and blew 90% of the film's budget on theatrical blood. The premise of this movie has been done much better in other films, such as The Running Man, Death Race 2000, Battle Royale, Series 7: The Contenders, and even Cube -- all of which I recommend over ""The Human Race.""

Then, in the remaining moments, we find out who was pulling the strings, and why. And it's so laugh-out-loud silly that I won't bother to spoil it here. Extra kudos, though, for the cheap CGI monster that looks like something out of the '90s video game ""Doom."" Horrendous.

Don't waste your time or money on this movie at all. Aside from the sub-plot involving the two veterans and a somewhat convincing performance by actress Trista Robinson, I can't think of any redeeming feature that justifies the $3.99 price tag of a rental.",1407456000,4,2257,4.779487179487179

6333268,2,B00J4LMIB0,"Indie movie ""The Human Race"" has an impossible task ahead of it. How will audiences take it seriously when it so completely reminds them of bigger and better films? ""The Hunger Games"" already referred to as a young adult version of the superior gore fest ""Battle Royale."" Arnold Schwarzenegger even found himself sprinting for his life in ""The Running Man.""

A group of people from different walks of life find themselves in a race to the death. After witnessing a blinding flash, they awaken in a strange obstacle course. Among the runners are two handicapped military veterans, a pregnant woman, a mother and daughter, and two school children. Voices in their heads tell them if they break any of the rules given to them, they will die. There can be only one winner, but what is the prize for reaching the finish line? And to what lengths will people go to make sure they win ""The Human Race?""

It would help if ""The Human Race"" added anything new to what we've already seen, but it doesn't. When the ""contestants"" veer off the path, their heads explode just like they did in low-budget 1990's sci-fi flick ""Deadlock (aka Wedlock)."" Director / Writer Paul Hough refuses to play it safe in terms of the victims he decides to dispose of. He also does his best to come up with new and more despicable ways for the racers to treat each other in an attempt to compensate for a lack of originality when it comes to the story.

In the production notes for ""The Human Race,"" Hough stated, ""Unfortunately in life, death has no prejudice. It doesn't discriminate. It will go after both the good and the bad. The abled and the disabled. The young and the old. The faithful and the faithless. I wanted to create a world in which anything can happen to anyone at any time.""

He continued, ""Further, it was important to me to have characters that one didn't pander to. That are flawed. That are actually a reflection of the society we live in - not just a wishful perception."" I will say he did accomplish what he strived for as far as making each character an example of a certain section of humanity.

""The Human Race"" is Unrated. I would give it an R-rating if I were a member of the MPAA. Lots of blood, violence, and disturbing images are the main factor for my decision. Another is a scene of attempted rape that many will find disturbing and quite intense.

Everything about ""The Human Race"" will remind you of another better movie you saw. The attempt at a shocking ending just feels like a major letdown crafted by a fan who's watched way too much ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits."" The only viewer who won't feel this way is one who somehow escaped ever seeing ""The Hunger Games,"" ""Battle Royale,"" ""The Running Man,"" or ""Deadlock (aka Wedlock)."" If you've already witnessed these fine films, then just move along. There's nothing new to see here unless you just want to witness CGI-enhanced exploding heads and other sequences of blood and gore.",1403568000,,2952,4.602661596958175

6333270,4,B00J4LMIB0,"Thus is billed as a sort of horror - sci-fi and that is pretty much on the money. Eighty people - seemingly unrelated- are plucked from their daily lives and placed in some sort of compound where they are told to `race or die'. There are many other rules such as `do not step on the grass' - or you will die, all infractions to the rules will result in death which seems to be caused by extreme blood pressure resulting in a sort of head exploding situation.

There are three safe zones, the house, the school and the prison but if you are lapped twice then - well you guessed it - you die. The main protagonist is Eddie who is an Afghanistan veteran who lost his leg in that conflict and was saved by Justin who has also been taken to this place. Of the eighty we have a very mixed bag, able bodied and disabled, old, young, white collar, seeming crooks and a couple who are deaf and use sign language.

So the race is anything but even. The big question is why is this happening and to what end. As the `contestants' try to work that out so the controller keeps announcing another death as the countdown goes irrevocably from eighty to the ultimate `one'.

This has been compared to `Battle Royale', but this is not of the same calibre to that very high level production. It is a very good watch with blood - a - plenty and enough existential dysfunctionalism to keep you both guessing and interested in the twists and turns. And I must say for an indie effort it ain't half bad. The real problem is there is not enough of a back story for each of the characters (except the main two army vets) so that there is very little in the empathy bank when they are facing the grim reaper. That said for an 84 minute film it does pack in quite a lot and the final twist will tie up any loose ends. One for horror fans and those who like things a bit dystopian - would give seven out of ten but am rounding up to four stars because of the diverse use of characters.",1400284800,6,1958,4.188328912466844
