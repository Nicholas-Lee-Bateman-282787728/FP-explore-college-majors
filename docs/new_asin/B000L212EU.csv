2699507,5,B000L212EU,"this is an excellent show. it's very informative and educational. i learned more watching josh bernstein host this show than i did in school.  i do miss josh in the new seasons, i don't watch it without josh on it!",1193875200,2,214,4.35
2699508,5,B000L212EU,"If you were pleased with the first season of DftT, you will be equally if not more impressed by season two.  Learning history in school was never this much fun.  You also get to learn a basic survival tool...he was bitten by several fire ants and almost died.  He therefore explains the proper things to do if this were to happen to you.

Like season one, you get the beautiful scenery, the in-depth investigation, and all the angles that make this one of the best documentary shows on TV.  So grab the popcorn and the soda, turn off the lights, and relax with a good show.",1174089600,9,573,4.367924528301887
2699511,5,B000L212EU,"This is one of the more entertaining documentary series.  Josh is funny, even when he doesn't try to be and there's even a very exciting episode where he almost dies.  There's something so endearing, yet dorky about him that keeps me watching :)",1311811200,,245,4.674418604651163
2699512,5,B000L212EU,"Includes interesting episodes and explores every angle and every theory regarding some of history's most intriguing mysteries. Great for those who love archaeology, but don't want to sit through excavation footage.",1261785600,,214,5.935483870967742

2699514,4,B000L212EU,"Bernstein is great as the host of Digging for the Truth.  He shows enthusiasm and is able to make what may seem mundane interesting.  While the 2nd season was not quite as good, the series is reminiscent of the old In Search Of... series with Leonard Nimoy.  I can heartily recommend these DVD's for those interested in archeology, sociology, or history.",1242864000,2,354,4.770491803278689
2699515,5,B000L212EU,"When I watch this #2 series, as I did the the #1 series, I feel like I am seeing parts of the world, that nobody has ever seen, and learning things that are new, eventhough its about history, and times that are very old!
 Josh Bernstein is as beautiful as ever, and the perfect host for this wonderful series! I could watch Josh Bernstein all day, Wow!

 I also admire, the behind the scenes people, who help make this show, a great success, and the camera man is great! I love all the amazing history experts, and specialists who explain their knowledge of all these wonderful things! I loved the ROANOKE LOST COLONY, and the one about CLEOPATRA, and TROY, and the one about SODOM & GOMORRAH, and I loved the one about the QUEEN OF SHEBA! I really enjoyed this series, and I highly recommend it! I loved it!

( There is another episode that is not in this series, and that is the DIGGIN FOR THE TRUTH: SEARCH FOR KING DAVID, I ordered it from the HISTORY CHANNEL/PBS, I also recommend getting this single episode, to add to your collection, it was very interesting!",1242864000,2,1066,4.423469387755102
2699516,5,B000L212EU,"I really enjoyed this series on the History Channel and wish it still aired with host Josh Bernstein, but alas, it does not, so I have purchased both seasons 1 & 2 on DVD. I love going back and watching favorite episodes. Great boxed set!",1238371200,4,238,4.311111111111111
2699517,5,B000L212EU,"Simply, superb, the film, the music, the text.
We can learn about geography and history around the world. Congratulations to Mr. Josh Bernstein and the whole crew or staff of History Channel for visiting all these wonderful and mysterious places and for giving us so many useful information and for showing us so beautiful landscapes. This documentary series is not only for private or familiar presentation but also for public libraries and schools.",1235692800,,450,5.178082191780822

2699520,5,B000L212EU,"This is like pure entertainment with some education thrown in, comedy, splash of drama, and when he tries to be all serious, he don't make it, the body language of the females that assists him through out the series could supply a college course in none verbal communication for a good 4 years...lol At the end of the season one DVDs there is a little interview with him. He talks about all the medical issues from constant travel to strange lands, but now watch him, he is a true Barron scientist! watch him taste salt from the dead sea, and taste sulfur from the desert and he is always like a child exploring the world with all his senses you can't help but love his innocence..lol",1219881600,3,684,4.436507936507937

8159827,5,B000L212EU,"As someone interested in history and prehistorical civilizations, I have to say this is the most informative documentary series I have ever watched. Josh talks to leading experts on the topic of the week, and leaves you with more information than you would ever need to know about the topic. He is also very clear as to what historians/archaeologists/scientists know for certain about the topic of the week.

I think about half the people we see nowadays interviewed on the History Channel would benefit from sitting down and watching this series. This answers a lot of the questions that other people claim to be unknown.

If you want to know who built the pyramids, what happened on Easter Island, more information than you can handle about the Incas, Mayans, or Aztecs, or about various other interesting mysteries, watch this series.

Also, this series is available for download from iTunes for $25 for Seasons 1 & 2, and $11 for Season 3.",1329264000,2,943,4.84472049689441
8159828,5,B000L212EU,"Great teaching tool. Kids learn without being bored. I used it in English and History classes with excellent results. Kids take notes that I can turn into pop quizzes, and the vivid scenery opens the door to lively conversations and short summary essays using descriptive language.",1319673600,,281,5.130434782608695
