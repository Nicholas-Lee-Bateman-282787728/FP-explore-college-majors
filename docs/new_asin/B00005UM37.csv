1666173,5,B00005UM37,"Most can claim that they have seen the original Transformers TV show and declare it the best animated show they ever saw growing up as a child. Well, now, I have a say in that to. While I was growing up, I watched Beast Wars and it was without a doubt the best animated show at the time.
I recall watching it early in the morning on a 5-day block of morning animation that included other shows like GI Joe Extreme (something a kin to Force Five)and then watching the second season a few years later. I highly enjoyed the series and tried to buy all of the toys as well. Now, my childhood has returned to me. This DVD set is great. It starts out with the first six episodes which pretty much introduce all the main characters: Optimus, Cheetor, Ratrap, Rinox, Megatron, Terrasaur, Scorpinoc, Dinobot and Taransalaus.
These first six episodes are pretty good, but the first season is only minor episodic episodes with a few new characters added along the way. The real meat of the story comes in the second season where the story of Cybertron finally comes into play. Overall though, this is a good start to a great story and gets way better down the road. Recommended to just about anyone.",1019520000,9,1188,4.47926267281106
1666174,4,B00005UM37,"This is a great series. The graphics seem a little dated now, but the story is still top notch. It plays great, but is lacking any good extras. ...",1016323200,,147,4.103448275862069
1666175,5,B00005UM37,"Beast Wars was the first all-cgi transformers show. Not only was the animation 3-D,but for the first time so were the characters. Fans of the original show still claim the 80's cartoon was the best, but let's face it:it was little more than a long commercial. With Beast Wars, the characters have personalities and motivation for their actions. This show also tells one long story. It is not the typical good guys vs bad guys in self-contained episodes. This saga takes place hundreds of years after 'Transformers-the movie'. The autobots and decepticons have long ago upgraded to smaller energy conserving factions called maximals and predacons. The two share an uneasy truce until a rogue predcon and his crew steal an ancient artifact and head for deep space. The maximal exploration ship Axalon pursues the predacons through a time warp and crashes on an unknown planet somewhere in time...The two factions are stranded, battling each other and finding clues of a prior civilization. The Beast Wars have begun....can't wait for Beast Machines!",1013904000,5,1047,5.128654970760234
1666176,5,B00005UM37,"This is a great Dvd. We love ""Beast Wars"" and are glad to have this one on DVD. The buy info is wrong though, this is ONLY Volume 1. It contains 6 episodes-
BW Part 1, BW part 2, The Web, Equal Measures, Chain Of Command, and Power surge. Quality is Excellent. We are glad we bought it, but were disapointed to find only Vol. 1. Still an incredible find. Very satisfied. Now to find the others......",1013731200,3,399,4.194805194805195
1666177,5,B00005UM37,"My review of this movie rocks! I could not believe how clear the images and the sound are so superb even better when it was original aired. Rhino did an excellent job in the past with the Transformers the Move and GI Joe.

1666178,5,B00005UM37,I always loved the original Transformers and when Beast Wars came out I didn't what any thing to do with it but after I watched it I knew that the show would become part of the Transformer History.,1008115200,2,197,4.2105263157894735
1666179,5,B00005UM37,"I used to watch these and I'd always find time to talk about them and how cool each episode was with my friend at school. The plot is great, it's even funny, and it's cool how it inter-twines with the original Transformers series which I used to watch growing up. A must buy for fans of the originals.",1042675200,9,301,4.206896551724138
1666180,5,B00005UM37,"I have all episodes of G1/Beast Wars/Beast Machines on VHS and have had Transformer episode's watching marathons a few times and everytime i watch the last few episodes of The Beast Wars i still get chill'a down my spine..when the Maximals goes to the legendary Autobot ship known as the Ark which is the orig ship that thier Golden Age Ancestors Autobots crashed into the volcano causing to go into thier lock status etc..and seeing Optimus Prime in all his CGI glory and Optimus Primal together.and G1 Megatron..Soundwave which of course they wake up in modern times to begin the ***The Great War***
seeing the Decepticons ship Nemesis in Beast Wars just completed it..amazing story telling..
i have not brought any of the Beast War DVD episodes but in time i am sure i will...i am just reviewing the seasons over all story telling....it is a blessing to watch the over and over again..same with Beast Machines afterwards...even though G1 is still my fav..Beast Wars was a great chance to remember and old while being soaked in with the new...",1034380800,7,1045,4.811111111111111
1666181,5,B00005UM37,"The minute I saw this on sale, I ordered it.  I have always been a Beast Wars fan since I can remember.  The money is well spent towards it.  The dvd qualities absolutely make the Beast Wars episodes more vivid toward sound and picture quality.  It includes the first six episodes which have great storylines and actors to perform thier voices.  What makes Beast Wars such a good series is you can be any age to understand it.  To be honest, it is sort of an educational series as well.  They talk about everything from teamwork to molecular structures while mixing in action and suspense.  It's educational, entraining and overall, excellent.",1030579200,6,643,4.72972972972973
1666182,4,B00005UM37,"OK, I'm going to do a little DVD review here first:
Picture Quality: AWESOME!!! A+ - Crisp & Clear. No fuzziness. Excellent transfer. Bright vibrant colors. No CGI flutter.
Animation: Average to Good. B - Being that the show debuted in '96, CGI hadn't matured like it did by 1999. When compared to the animation of Roughnecks: Starship Troopers, Beast Wars animation looks a bit dated at times, especially in this first season.  IIRC It gets better with later episodes.
Sound: Good. A- Using Dolby 5.1, the soundtrack creates a submersive sound environment.  You are constantly enveloped in sound due to the rear speakers being used extensively for the music and the occasional rear sound effect.  However, with this volume at least the front left and right channels don't seem to have the punch that I thought they would.  Most action and dialogue is anchored in the center speaker.  But this improves with Volume 2 with more sound effects in the side channels.  The .1 LFE channel is a bit weak in the this volume, but it's  stronger in Volume 2.  However, don't get me wrong, this is still a good soundtrack, I just thought it was a little weak in areas as noted above.
Episodes:
1) Beast Wars Part 1: The Predacons and Maximals are fighting through space and crash on an unknown planet. The planet is rich in Energon and powerful enough to fuel galactic conquest. And so the battle for the planet begins!
2) Beast Wars Part 2: The battle between the Maximals and the Predacons continues. It starts off as Dinobot joins the Maximals after a fight with Optimus Primal for leadership which then gets cut short by a Predacon ambush. The battle culminates with the discovery and fight over a giant Energon crystal atop a mountain.
3) The Web: Rhinox develops a long-range comlink and Cheetor gets into trouble with a Predacons. He becomes trapped by Tarantulus's web device which will slowly and surely drain all of his energy unless he can get free. Mousetrap comes to the rescue and springs a surprise trap on Tarantulus.
4) Equal Meausures: Cheetor tries to prove himself to Optimus Primal by setting up a series of scanner prods, but he srikes a Energon stream that acts as a teleporter between the Predacon base and the Maximal base. Cheetor get transported to the Predacon base and Terrorasaur gets transported to Maximal base.
5) Chain of Command: A battle between the Predacons and the Maximals at the Stonehenge arrangement unleashes a signal to outer space that summons a mysterious probe. The probe arrives and absorbs Optimus Primal into its memory banks temporarily, so the Maximals have to choose a new leader. Dinobot tries to bully his way into the role.
6) Power Surge: Terrorsaur finds a floating mountian loaded with Energon that give him super-charged abilities but with a price of dependence. Having this new power, he challenges Megatron for leadership and pretty much trashes him. But after the mountain explodes, Terrasaur is back to square one and Megatron has been rebuilt. [gulp]
And for those fans of the original G1 Transformers, the draw towards Beast Wars is one of more realistic fight scenes.  Transformer actually get blow away and there's actually some emotion in their fights as well, giving the fights more impact.",1030147200,9,3250,4.851985559566787
1666183,4,B00005UM37,"This DVD continues Season one of the television series. Season one was the weakest of the three seasons, but there were still a lot of good episodes. The descriptions are completely wrong by the 2 hosers who reviewed the DVD. Beast Wars was not based on a video game, the show did not originally air on Fox Kids, and Beast Wars did not make every toy into a character on the show. Beast Wars is the best show based on an existing toy line. The creators did not turn every toy into a character; there was plot, growth of characters, and even the killing off of beloved characters. Even when a new toy was coming out of said character. The animation is a little rough in the first season, but it gradually gets better. The best part about these DVDs is that they are the original uncensored episodes before Fox Kids brought out the scissors and toned down the violence.",1028332800,3,867,4.425
1666184,4,B00005UM37,"I enjoyed seeing all those episodes again on DVD. Beast Wars will go down in history for me. However, I think it could have been better if it was a complete 1st season DVD collector's item.",1028160000,,189,4.277777777777778
1666185,5,B00005UM37,"I am 16 years old, the show was cancelled 3 years ago, and it is still my favorite show of all time. It is fun for adults as well as kids, and will keep you entertained until the next volume comes out.",1028160000,3,201,3.8095238095238093
1666186,5,B00005UM37,"This DVD is very well put together, as is the show.  It contains the very first six episodes from the first season.  The CGI is a mind-blower (even better when it comes to the third season).  The storyline is very well kept between this new generation of Transformers and the original G1/G2 Autobots and Decepticons.  And instead of robots in disguise with vehicles, it's robots in disguise with animals.  Their beast forms help protect themselves from raw, unstable energon.  A very clever idea.  Optimus Primal (named after the great Autobot leader Optimus Prime) leads his crew (Rhinox, Rattrap, Cheetor and Dinobot) through a war against their evil enemies, the Predacons.  Megatron (named after the evil Decepticon leader) battles his way to victory with his minions (Scorponok, Tarantulas, Waspinator and Terrorsaur) in ambition to conquer and crush the Maximals.  Beast Wars ties in very well to the original Transformers as the seasons go on.  It has characters that can be liked by everyone.  Don't keep your mind shut on the first generation of Transformers.  Open it to a new computer generated series which keeps the G1/G2 series alive.  I barely remember the original Transformers, but since I was so interested in Beast Wars, I got hooked onto it again.  Yes, Beast Wars is new, doesn't have nearly as many characters, but there is a lot of humor, action, battles, adventure and comes back to the Tripredacus Council, Ravage, the Autobots and the Decepticons.  Keep up with the generations of this remarkable show.  Don't stop at the first one because IT did not stop there.  And remember, the Autobots are the ancestors of the Maximals and the Decepticons are the ancestors of the Predacons.  They are NOT the same!  :-)",1026777600,6,1735,4.961805555555555
1666187,4,B00005UM37,"The classic Beast Wars saga is back! For those who grew up with it, here is your chance to relive your childhood. The story takes place about a generation after the great war from Transformers The Movie. The new Predicons break the treaty with the Maximals and steal a golden disc that will lead them to Energon, a main power source. The Maximals follow on the Axalon and are drawn into a strange planet along with the Predicons.
Beast Wars Part 1 (B): After the Predicons and Maximals get their new beast forms to protect themselves from Energon, Cheetor discovers Waspinator and the two sides are drawn into battle.
Beast Wars Part 2 (B-): Dinobot decides to join the Maximals. When Megatron's missile hits a mountain, it exposes a huge amount of Energon. Now, a race to the top of the mountain is on for the Energon.
The Web (B+): Cheetor gets cocky when he is scrapped by Scorponoc's missile and lets him get away with the Energon. When Cheetor tries to go out and get it back, he is ambushed by Terancalious and gets caught in his energy draining web.
Overall, the episodes aren't the best, but they do provide a solid intro to one heck of a great series.",1020124800,7,1160,4.502369668246446

7954969,1,B00005UM37,"I tried to watch this show at the urging of a some pals, but I think it must be a series you have to grow up with in order to appreciate. I really disliked this show; I feel badly about it, but the show looks dated and the characters seem overly emotional to me. The only show I can compare this to in terms of the sheer unenjoyment I derived it from it, is Zardos (a movie with Sean Connery, awful).

I think that what might set this show apart from hand animated cartoons are the computer graphics. They're just too old now. It's an interesting study in history, I suppose, but for entertainment purposes, my preference is to give it a miss.",1288137600,,643,4.227642276422764

7954971,5,B00005UM37,"I grew up watching Johnny Quest. There was lots of automated vilians on that show, therefore Transformers was not a big leap for me.
After Transformers went off the air I was sad, but then I happened upon Beast Wars. WOW, it was so visually exciting to me, I was hooked right away.
Season 1, Episode 22: The Low Road
Original Air Date: 10 February 1997
I think this is the best episode in the whole series. Rhinox ate some bad seeds/pods while grazing, and he farted a nuclear blast in the direction of Megatron.
Don't feel bad for Megatron, he saw it comming and deserved it.
I felt the need to write this review because Transformers the movie is comming out in July 07, and the last time someone wrote a review for this DVD was 2004.
I love this series get it, love it, enjoy it.",1175644800,,781,4.283783783783784
7954972,4,B00005UM37,"Being a cartoon, this show starts out with a lot of stigmas. I loved the original transformers as a kid. This show was unbelievable. Yes, it was all about selling toys but the creators weren't just satisfied with that alone. The story telling is weaven together better than most primetime television shows. There are very few holes. I dare you not to feel a little teery eyed when Dinobot hits the dust. One of the saddest deaths I've seen on the tube. Oh and Austria stop blasting the show. You have obviously not seen the show and are just a cranky Transformers fan that won't give this new show any respect. Those are the only people that do not like this show. Those that haven't seen it and dismiss it as nothing but a stupid cartoon. Then, there's the original Transformers fans that can't accept this show being better and never give it a chance. If you watch this show from the beginning you will be addicted, I guarantee you. Although as said the show really hits it's mark in season 2 with a lot of drama. Season 1 is a lot of introduction. Season 3 is the payoff with the bots heading back home, very good season. Season 4 is a bit of a mess in auto world but it's entertaining. There wasn't anywhere else to go after season 4. It was a fun ride. I give it a 4 but for cartoons this is definitely a big 5 stars.",1089849600,21,1322,4.270916334661354
