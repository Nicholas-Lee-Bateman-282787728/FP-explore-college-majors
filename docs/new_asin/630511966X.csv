7883068,4,630511966X,This video is a little dated but has some great interviews with Billy Sheehan. Billy shows his musical knowledge by demonstrating diatonic scales up the neck and he emphasises the importance of being a solid BASS player first rather than a soloist. He also stresses the importance of playing cover material to get your chops and playing with a drummer to develop solid time and feel. A good video.,1262304000,,397,4.768115942028985

Left hand, right hand and some pretty interesting double hand techniques. Plus some  great bass playing by Billy. Bonus points for a 6 minute bass solo.",953510400,2,285,4.480769230769231
