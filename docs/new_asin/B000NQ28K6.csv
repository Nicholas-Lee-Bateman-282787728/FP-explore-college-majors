2777340,2,B000NQ28K6,"This was a once in a life time opportunity that was truly wasted. Supposedly some of the biggest names in Westerns were gathered for a reunion. The problem was that most of the biggest names were not really there. They were there only by having their pictures showed and their names read. Those who at least showed up had nothing to do. They either sat speechless at saloon tables or spent the better part of the hour listening to some ridiculouus saloon girls sing and dance about the west. This was a great opportunity to learn more about the heroes of tv's golden years, yet the producers decided to spend most of the time as if it were a variety show. Oh well, it's probably better than nothing at all.",1187740800,6,706,4.438461538461539
2777341,3,B000NQ28K6,"This show/DVD is fun, but far from great. On a purely nostalgia level it is fun to see all the old-timers. They don't really do or say much and the clips aren't great for the most part, but it is nice to see them all together. The quality of the DVD also leaves something to be desired. And while some of the actors are ""introduced,"" others, such as Rex Allen, are talked about but never really shown, even though he was there at the reunion.

I believe this is from a TV show in 1980 or thereabouts, so it would be hard to do again as many of these people are no longer with us. So on the basis that that is no longer possible it's fun, though could have been a lot better. Some notable stars who were still alive at the time are either shown only in clips, as opposed to being there live, or some are absent altogether. Still, it was nice to see those who were there and to see Roy and Dale and the rest sing ""Happy Trails"" at the end. Touching and nostalgic.

Many of the shows mentioned on this DVD are available either in stand-alone DVDs or in sets of classic old TV shows and such.

I'm debating over giving this three or four stars. If I could give it 3 I would. As it is I will probably give it three. For the price it is certainly worth it for those who like westerns, whether you grew up with them or catch them on Encore Westerns, Turner Classics or TV Land, though here we have mostly TV stars as opposed to film stars, with some crossovers, notably the host, Glenn Ford.",1177027200,12,1484,4.1280276816609

8180581,4,B000NQ28K6,"This is a great group of western stars, but only half of the original show that aired.  I think it is most selfish for the person putting this out to cut it in half and cheat everyone of seeing it in it's entirety.  Too much time was devoted to those singing cowgirls, people wanted to see the western stars we all grew up with, not hose girls.  Wish they would reissue it and give us the whole show.  Most of these folks are gone now and it would be nice to see the whole show.",1430092800,,478,4.0

8180583,5,B000NQ28K6,"Glenn Ford was one of my favorite western actors and the perfect choice to host this film.  It was wonderful to see so many of the
stars from popular shows like Cade's County, Rifleman, Lawman, Laredo, High Chaparral, Dale and Roy Rogers, Lone Ranger, The Virginian, etc.  This ""reunion"" film was made in 1979 and it was fascinating to see how the stars had begun to age at that time, and especially how the child actors had grown into adults.  Many of the actors are no longer with us, and to me, that made it an even more heartwarming walk down memory lane......back in the time when the west really was fun.",1371686400,2,610,4.428571428571429

8180585,5,B000NQ28K6,This was a very good dvd. It was fun to see the old western stars all together again. It showed highlights of the best westerns on TV. It would be nice if they would bring back westerns on TV.,1281312000,2,192,3.948717948717949

8180587,3,B000NQ28K6,"I bought this recently since I love the old western series from the
50'sand 60's that I grew up on.  I enjoyed seeing the stars I
remembered, but whats with Alan(The Skipper)Hale Jr. and Dan(Grizzly Adams)Haggerty doing in it??  I was disappointed they didn't
touch harder on the western series and its stars. It played more
like a variety show with useless saloon girl numbers, and the few
stars that spoke lines were obviously reading Q cards.  This would
have been so much better if say Hugh O'Brian would of hosted and
they had just western stars from that TV western era. Glen Ford is a great western movie star, but Cade's County wasn't really a western from the 50's & 60's.  I also saw Tony Young(Gunslinger), Henry Darrow & Mark Slade(High Charparral) who had no lines and nothing to do. William Smith should have been invited, Peter Brown & Neville Brand were there, but not for the Laredo series?? My score is 3 out of 5.",1212019200,,932,4.562874251497006
8180588,5,B000NQ28K6,"This is a great TV special look back at TV western stars, some who are no longer with us. It was great to see Clayton Moore, the Lone Ranger, and Doc and Festus from Gunsmoke.  You even get to see people you forgot were in westerns, and Iron Eyes Cody, who also did the great anti-litter commercial in the 70's. I highly recommend this video to people who liked to watch western TV shows from the 50's into the 60's, and those of us who watched the re-runs on TV when we were kids.",1208044800,5,481,4.117021276595745
