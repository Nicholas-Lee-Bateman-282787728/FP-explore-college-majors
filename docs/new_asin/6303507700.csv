7849014,5,6303507700,"Two friends Susan (Crystal Bernard) and Nicole (Traci Lords) exchange identities so that Susan's insurance can cover an operation for Nicole. Looks like a small medical mistake causes Nicole's death. Or was there more too it? Now Susan officially dead and still in the persona of Nicole can not go to the authorities and enlists the help of Ron Holden (Judge Reinhold) to help sort things out. It dose not take long for us to figure it out and spend the rest of the time kibitzing. Of course Susan never listens to us.

This film was made for TV and it shows in the formula story and lo budget setting. However veteran actor Judge Reinhold does his best.",1505174400,,654,4.5423728813559325
7849015,5,6303507700,"This is an absolutely ""killer"" film starring the adorable Crystal Bernard and hunkalicious Judge Reinehold. Identities are traded between Crystal and her friend, Traci Lords. They only do it for emergency medical reasons. Intrigue!! Intrigue!! What could happen next?

Could anyone else not be who he says he is -- and how did her friend die during surgery? There are lots of questions to be answered here, and it's exciting every step of the way. I only wish As Good As Dead would come out on DVD!",1285027200,,498,4.724137931034483
7849016,1,6303507700,"If you love Crystal Bernard you will want to see this video, otherwise don't. This woman has made a career of being cute and does it exceptionally well. She assumes the identity of her bad-girl friend played by former pornstar Traci Lords who is in the film very briefly. By some contrived circumstances they switch places after becoming very unlikely friends. After Traci is murdered, Crystal is stuck in her friends unhappy life. The upside of this being you get to see Crystal dress up in tiny skirts and leather. Judge Rheinhold played a creep as he often does. The ending was predictably flat.",1074988800,3,598,4.759615384615385
7849017,3,6303507700,"As good as dead had the makings for a bad B movie right from the beginning.  I mean, come on.  Crystal Bernard with a lead role?  But, actually she did a decent job.  I wish I could say the same for the rest of the actors though.  I always thought Judge Reinhold was a good actor.  Well, he was pitiful in this film.  It was almost laughable.  Also, some of the dialogue spewing from these people's lips was incredibly cheesy.  And the ending was pretty pitiful also.  But, this movie did do well in certain areas like suspense.  It kept me interested throughout the whole movie, which is always a plus.  The directing wasn't bad either.  The premise was OK.  The movie just needed a little bit more talent in it.  Overall, As good as dead is a marginal movie that makes the most out of itself with the poor acting.  3 Stars",992304000,4,824,4.287581699346405
