3649600,5,B001IUROPU,"This was Kylie's latest tour, KYLIEX2008, filmed at the O2 Arena in London, this past summer.  I was there personally and the DVD showcases the amazing show from the beginning with ""Speakerphone"" to the finale of her 1st hit 21 years ago, ""I Should Be So Lucky.""

Any fan of the US who does not know all of her songs will enjoy this DVD as there are many familiar songs that have been released in the States, but many new ones of her past that you will fall in love with.",1228694400,,471,4.164835164835165
3649601,1,B001IUROPU,"I really don't like writing this! I have been a Kylie fan since her career started (Have a promo LP.) And so of all my favorites this hurts. I will say if you are like me a dedicated fan you still probably should have it in your collection. Also perhaps whatever home theatre system you have might make a difference too. I built mine for concerts and music, so flaws show up. ( to duplicate it 20K $ or so took many years to build) So my experience is this, When I first put it in the FBI don't copy thing was fuzzy I though my old eyes were really tired! Then when to the set up noticed audio had no DTS. This is very strange for a newer video. So started the concert, fuzzy video, and very poor sound.  Thought at first something wrong with system so put in a Kylie from 2002. Was great. So I wondered did I get a defective disc? Well put my glasses on looked at box, this is an import from the Phillipines (mine anyway) and says ""Kylie Minogue appears courtesy of Parlophone/emi"" so I really don't know what I have here. It is a part of my collection of course, and Kylie had nothing to do with it, I just was very disappointed in the quality.",1316131200,,1146,4.116071428571429
3649602,5,B001IUROPU,"This a fantastic concert with unparalleled production, dancing and performances. Kylie really brings down the house with this non-stop adventure. Highly recommended -- even thinking might make a great Christmas/Holiday gift for other friends.",1312243200,,242,6.147058823529412
3649603,5,B001IUROPU,"This was the concert event of the year in 2008 next to Madonna though I think Kylie did it better seeing as she had a way better album to promote with X. The concert starts out with the best track on the album Speakerphone which just puts you in an amazing mood and let's you know your in for a grand time. Plus for the first time in recent memory Kylie includes 4 (some just samples) unreleased tracks in the concert (Boombox before Can't Get You Outta My Head, Ruffle My Feathers, Sometime Samurai, & Flower). Definitively her best tour till Aphrodite atleast!",1312243200,2,562,4.466019417475728
3649604,5,B001IUROPU,"Kylie Minogue's X tour dvd is so fantastic. It's a great arrangement of songs as well as costumes and themes. It just proves how Kylie's presence in pop culture is needed. Suggestion: be sure to watch the Japanese Manga segment of the concert. It is, to me, the greatest part of the entire show.",1299024000,,295,4.481481481481482
3649605,5,B001IUROPU,"If you live in the U.S. it is very hard to find any Kylie Minogue products in stores, so discovering this on amazon was a great find. It has excellent sound quality and arrived in great condition and on time.",1293667200,2,208,4.225
3649606,4,B001IUROPU,"While Kylies SHOWGIRL is all about the production, which is huge, this concert places a bit more emphasis on Kylie's singing.  It's mostly the same songs as Showgirl, but in a different order and with different arrangements. I think this concert is a bit more intimate and a bit less risque.  I would watch this one first and follow it with Showgirl.  If I only purchased 1, it would be Showgirl.",1290816000,,396,4.549295774647887
3649607,3,B001IUROPU,"Having never had the chance to see Kylie live in person, I have to rely on her dvd releases to see her concert tours.  Some have been great, such as the two Showgirl tour variations, others like the Fever tour have left me feeling flat.  I had heard, read and seen quite a bit about the X tour, so I was dissappointed that its intial dvd release did not include a US version.  However, now those of us in the US can get this show on DVD, and it's pretty well worth the wait.  Kylie's stage is empty , it basically reminds me of an open laptop, the stage is just flat and open and it has a giant video screen behind it.  I was worried that this tour may suffer from a lack of an actual set, but the video screen is put to to good use and the stage surface itself is also able to display different projections.  It makes this a nice change from the norm in terms of how the show is staged.  I was not a huge fan of the X album, ans although there are quite a few tracks from that disc in the setlist, the overall song selection is still pretty good.  Showgirl was a hits tour so I had no expectation that this show would not be focussed on the accompanying album.  As always Kylies band, dancer and Kylie herself give their all and put on afu entertaining show.  As much as I love Madonna, and think her live shows set the bar for this type of tour, Kylie seems to truly be having a good time on stage, where as Madge often seems like she is just going through the motions.  I wanted to give this dvd 4 stars but I am docking it a point because the picture quality on this dvd is really bad.  I actually had to watch it in parts, because the jerky almost slow motion effect that permeates every close shot gave me a splitting headache.  Im not sure what the reason for filming it in this style was, but it really makes this disc hard to watch.  Overall a good show and worth the purchase even if the video quality is poor and distracting.",1274832000,,1936,4.073878627968337
3649608,5,B001IUROPU,"Of all the concert DVDs of Kylie Minogue, this is her BEST!! If you look back to her older concerts, you can really see how she has evolved as a performer. Her previous shows were awesome but this is the best. This concert includes the best remixes, astounding choreaography, impressive sets and Kylie, of course, with fantastic vocals. In my opinion, her voice in this concert is more powerful. Before, she had a little songbirds delicate voice. Now, she has a voice of endless possibilities. From her soprano range in 'Your Disco Needs You' to her soft ballad in 'I Believe in You' and to her rock moment in 'Slow', her voice is infinite. Her dancing has also improved like the fact that she joins her dancers in 'Copacabana'. Oh, and she also brought our favorite dancers like Jason Beitel (soo HOT!!) and Marco de Silva (sooo..manly!!) The set is composed of very large screens in the back while the floor also acts as another screen. There is one large horizontal lift and if I have to talk about all the stage props, I'll be here all day. So buy the concert!! You will not be disappointed!!!",1271203200,,1097,4.573604060913706
3649609,5,B001IUROPU,"i have 6 kylie minogue concerts this is her second since her  cancer recovery, its the bigest boldest extravaganza on stage to dade.she is in my opinion a goodwill and all round tallent to date, her and this concert is a force to be reckond with in my eyes no one will ever surpass this grand lady of grace style and sheer ellagance, what a feast for the ears eyes and sensses, see this concert please,",1266537600,2,402,4.2894736842105265
3649610,5,B001IUROPU,"The sets and production effects in this concert are amazing! When I first started watching this concert I was slightly put off because it starts off as a rock concert, which is not in Kylies' usual style, myself prefering her big production numbers with lots of instruments and dancing, but thinking back she usually splits her concerts into 3 or 4 themes and soon the concert morphs into another theme and Kylie is doing some of her old songs in a different tempo in a new approach. (On A Night Like This is done as a stunning ballroom waltz with swirling complex dances)  This woman is so far ahead of her contemporaries, by the time everyone catches up to her, she has left everyone behind again.  This woman is a natural entertainer who likes what she does and it shows!  The dancing and acting is complex and precise and the music is exciting.  Kylie seems to know what is happening around her at all times, eg. in one song her unfurled bowtie she has around her neck falls to the ground, (I think it was Kids) and in the next song she sweeps it back off the floor and around her neck like it was all part of the act and was deliberately left at that spot on the floor without anyone noticing.  Her stamina is amazing, and at the end she has gone full out and is still smiling and enjoying her fans feedback.  She is one of the greatest entertainers of our time!",1265846400,,1367,4.341176470588235
3649611,2,B001IUROPU,"She's no Madonna and this show proves why. Kylie Minogue's first proper full on tour didn't happen until 4 years into her career in 1991 and then it only managed to land in the UK, Eire, France, Australia and a few dates in Japan, such is her limited popularity. X was if im honest a big step on from her usual campery and feathers bonanza but apart from updates with her set, nothing else has changed. I don't have a problem with Kylie's music, even though her last few albums have been a bit of a let down, but her shows usually tread squarely into Madonna territory and that, i have a big problem with. If you are going to do ""a Madonna"" then do it well! Kylie?, well she doesnt. Many of Kylie's tours have taken cues from Madonna tours of old, take her Fever Tour from 2001, it may as well been called Drowned World Tour by Kylie with snippets of Blond Ambition for good measure, Showgirl was a rehash of Madonnas infamous Girly Show tour, she even coerced D&G and Gaultier to create costumes for her latter tours to inject that MADG-ic into her productions, it didn't quite work sadly for me. The reason? there really is only one Madonna, and if shes paying homage to her idol then she really needs to stop now, shes been doing it for nearly 20 years, Kylie we get the message, you love Madonna!. With regards to this show however i felt it lacked something that Madonna has within her tours by the bucket load, drama!! Kylie almost looks wooden on stage, like she never really feels comfortable with all that space, she never truly owns the stage or crowd like Madonna does, she may be sweet and speak a little more to the crowd but i feel they respect her less, Madonna has the audience eating out of her hand, you want to go back for more, with Kylie i wanted to leave half way through for a beer!. Its the way its always been. During X i also found recurrent themes that you would NEVER find in a Madonna tour, those stupid cyborg dancers shes been peddling for years and that awful cheerleader look since her On A Night Like This tour, Why? I also found the stage and sets bland and a bit uninspired, the screens swallowed her and the show whole, its was more a case of style over substance in my opinion. When Madonna used 4 gigantic screens for Re-Invention tour in the spring of 2004, they were the largest ever used in a tour at the time, they moved and rotated with the stage which gave for a really interesting show, very classy. On X that screen was just a huge flat TV with a tiny human on a stage in front, it took over and she got lost, she doesnt dance either, at all! Madonna has always danced and exceptionally well, Kylie is well known for her inability to move, on the whole i found the show a let down, she also tried to do a Madonna by playing most of the songs from X with a few oldies, Madonna's Confessions and Candy albums were far more entertaining than either Body Language or X, they contained solid, sure-fire hits and great, versatile material, Madonna remixes her old tunes and mash's them together with other top dance tunes, im sure Kylie will be doing this very soon as shes currently pilfered Madonna's right hand man of the last decade, Mr Stuart Price to produce some songs on her new album! Look out for the next old Madonna tour courtesy of Kylie!",1263340800,,3292,4.33711507293355

3649614,3,B001IUROPU,"For any die-hard fan this certainly a must buy. The concert and Kylie are of course terrific, but the quality of the picture is particularly poor.

In these days where concerts can easily be shot in HD, you think this would have been the case here which would give the spectacular visuals (and Kylie herself) the treatment they certainly deserve. It looks like a lot of the close ups where shot from very far away and so you get a lot of grainy picture and out-of-focus moments. I so wanted to love it, but the picture quality was a major distraction for me. Maybe they'll get it together and get some Kylie concerts in Blu-Ray format at some point... this one would have been so great in that format.

Kylie, the music, overall concert spectacle get an A. Quality of video footage gets a C-. (FYI: Showgirl is a far better filmed concert)",1254787200,,839,4.477124183006536
3649615,5,B001IUROPU,"The DVD itself works on my dvd player at home, I live in the states, and although it says REGION 3 on the dvd casing there are no problems viewing it. Kylie, the concert, I cannot find the words to express the JOY I felt when I watched it for the first time. And then again and again. Simply the only word I could find right now in my mind is ""WOW!""",1246924800,2,349,3.861111111111111
3649616,5,B001IUROPU,"I was very excited to hear that KylieX2008 is finally coming to DVD. When I first ordered it, I was a little sceptical because I haven't really heard anything about the DVD coming to NTSC format (for US & Canada). After I read the reviews, I had to order it - watched it for the first time last Saturday and fell in love with it!! This is by far one of Kylie's best tours!! It was very successful last year and is completely different from her previous concerts! Kylie is backed up by her band (with brass players), a minimalist set with huge LCD screens which cue as curtains, and different acts. Here's the setlist:
ACT 1: Xlectro Static - Kylie is dressed as a spiderwoman/dancers as robots
1. Speakerphone
2. Can't Get You Out Of My Head (Greg Kurtsin Remix) - love this version and I like how she adds some lines from her unreleased song ""Boombox.""
3. Ruffle My Feathers - an unreleased track from the X sessions
4. In Your Eyes (X2008 version) - this is an electro remix of IYE. Love this version!
ACT 2: Cheer Squad - Kylie and her dancers are dressed as cheerleaders/American football players at a pep rally!
5. Heart Beat Rock
6. Wow
7. Shocked (DNA Mix)
ACT 3: Beach Party - my favorite section! Kylie and her dancers are dressed as sailors
8. Loveboat - One of my favorite songs off of Light Years! I like how she also incorporates the LoveBoat theme song in the beginning
9. Copacabana - The Barry Manilow cover with her dancers acting out the song with Kylie's vocals!
10. Spinning Around - Kylie does a mash-up with Spinning Around to the music of Cheryl Lynn's Got To Be Real
ACT 4: Xposed - Kylie is dressed as an ""erotic bellboy""
11. Like a Drug - Kylie sings as she is riding on a platinum skull
12. Slow - it's slightly remixed with a rock feel to it. Kylie also sings some lines from ""Free.""
13. 2 Hearts - Kylie grooves to this song along with her band!
ACT 5: Naughty Manga Girl - Kylie is dressed as a Manga inspired character while her dancers are dressed as Samurais and Geishas!
14. Sometime Samurai - a video interlude with her acrobats
15. Come Into My World (Fischerspooner Remix) - the set is awesome! Petals and snow flying from the air while Kylie comes out of a black pyramid.
16. Nu-Di-Ty - one word: HOT!!
17 Sensitized
ACT 6: Starry Nights - Kylie is dressed in a blue gown - this is the slow section of the concert
18. Flower - an unreleased song from the X sessions
19. I Believe In You (Ballad Version) - I really like this song as a ballad. It sounds very melodic
ACT 7: Black Versus White - Kylie is dressed as an 18th century coachman while her dancers are also dressed in black & white.
20. On A Night Like This - starts out as an Overture, Kylie's pianist playing the piano while the dancers are dancing the waltz, and next we see Kylie!
21. Your Disco Needs You - it's good to see that she resurrected this song from when she did Showgirls Greatest Hits Tour.
22. Kids - Kylie sings this with her background vocalists.
23. Step Back In Time - starts off acapella and then becomes remixed with a color theme!
24. In My Arms
ACT 8: Encore
25. No More Rain
26. The One (Freemasons Mix)
27. Love At First Sight (Ruff & Jam US Mix)
28. I Should Be So Lucky - a nice way to end the show!
Overall, this is her best tour to date!! Anyone that's a fan of Minogue's and loves the X album will really appreciate this show!",1244419200,37,3356,4.253521126760563
3649617,5,B001IUROPU,"I'll start of by summing up the show as a whole; it is a show, rather then a concert. The costumes, set pieces, band and backing singers are as (or maybe even more) important as Kylie herself. My eyes were darting all over the stage trying to take everything in.

The final rating on X2008 was the hardest Kylie show I've reviewed. I can't fault the overall show; there weren't any parts which bored me, the live music was fantastic, the dancers were great & the set pieces really helped to bring everything together. But; X2008 didn't seem very personal to Kylie. It looked more like a show for the sake of a show. I was just asked to list my 5 favourite songs out. I picked 3 out straight away, but then I had to think about the other 2. In the end I picked the remaining 2 because I loved the set pieces, not because I love the songs or because of Kylie's performance.

I'm going to give X2008 the full 5 stars and call it a job well done. I'm looking for fun & entertainment not perfection. There are flaws, but for me the positive aspects outweigh them.

I split my observations & thoughts into positives and negatives to fully review everything. Feel free to leave your comments & tell me what you think I've missed.

POSITIVES

I missed out on Kylie's `On A Night Like This' tour and I'm still really disappointed, as her `Light Years' album tracks are really cheerful and uplifting. So naturally, I was overjoyed to hear her perform two of my favourite tracks from that era; LOVE BOAT and YOUR DISCO NEEDS YOU. The audience loved them.

X2008's cover was the cheesy classic COPACABANA. The backing dancers acted out the lyrics. It sounds terribly camp, but trust me; it's really fun. You'll be humming along and tapping your feet.

We knew Kylie's biggest hit I CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD would be on the set list. It's updated by having a remix (Greg Kurstin mix), plus it's mashed up with unreleased track BOOMBOX.

While we're on the subject of mash-ups, there are another two; MICKEY (I'm not joking) is paired with HEART BEAT ROCK. A bit too cheesy for me, but it does go perfectly with the set piece (Kylie's a cheerleader).
The other mash up is Kylie's number one single SLOW and FREE (I'm not sure if she's ever done a studio recording of this track. She did perform it on her `Intimate & Live' tour though). I do like Slow, but I welcome the update, as she performed this track on her last two tours.

Kylie performs two new, unreleased songs for us. RUFFLE MY FEATHERS and FLOWER.

Her `Fever' album single COME INTO MY WORLD is remixed (Fischerspooner mix). I'm not a fan of the song, so it was nice to get the edgier remix here.

Also remixed was her X track THE ONE (Freemasons mix). It is nice to hear something new to the version you already have. (I'm still annoyed though. She failed to perform The One and ALL I SEE at the show I went to. The 10,000 fans at my show mustn't been as worthy...)

The new band that is playing this tour is absolutely fantastic. Watch 2 HEARTS in particular and listen for yourself.

I've also briefly mentioned the set pieces. They are wonderful and they really bring the songs to life. My favourites are the Japanese garden and the 19th century ballroom that transforms into a disco. The American football field one is also great.

The dancers not only dance, they also act out the songs. It brings everything to life. Kylie also does some dancing herself, rather then the arm waving and bum wriggling we're used to seeing.

Jean Paul Gaultier designed Kylie's costumes. They're great as they're worn to tell a story, instead to just look pretty or sexy.

NEGATIVES

The biggest crime committed on this tour is not performing `Confide In Me'. I could have let her go with not performing her classic `Better The Devil You Know', but `Confide In Me' is the best song in Kylie's catalogue.
In fact, the only pre-Parlophone singles performed are; SHOCKED, STEP BACK IN TIME and I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY. I'm not sure if SOMETIME SAMURAI was a single or a b side, but that's here too.
There's nothing wrong with wanting to highlight her current sound, but please don't forget how you got here, please.

This tour is to celebrate her latest album X. So during the show she sings 11 out of the 13 tracks. One of these tracks is the crime against our ears NU DI TY. Seriously, most of her fans hate this song, so why perform this and leave out the missing X tracks `Stars' and `Cosmic' which are far better?

I already mentioned her new songs RUFFLE MY FEATHERS and FLOWER in the positive list, because everyone has different tastes.
Personally, I think the reason they weren't released on an album or as a b side is because they're not really that good. I was wondering what songs she could have done in their place (Hint; Confide In Me!!).

It was also a mistake to include KIDS. It's a duet, so it just doesn't have the same magic to it when she sings it with her backing singers.

During a lot of songs (especially ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS, I BELIEVE IN YOU and NO MORE RAIN) she goes overboard with her high-pitched notes. This seems like she's showing off to me. I don't think shrieking makes you a great singer. She's trying too hard...

And sometimes in other songs (SPEAKERPHONE, WOW and IN MY ARMS) she just shouts rather then sings.",1242864000,2,5286,4.43904958677686
3649618,4,B001IUROPU,"Kylie Minogue has never brought her major tour productions to the United States (even though she has 5 or 6 small shows planned this year).  Too bad, because we're definitely missing out!  Kylie Minogue's live performances are masterful, and this concert is no exception.

KylieX2008, as it's called, supports her latest album, X.  A massive set list, six costume changes and a mesmerizing backdrop made me completely jealous that I couldn't witness this live.  For the first tour in a while, Kylie focuses on the newer material, only performing three songs from her Stock-Aikman-Waterman days.  You get the huge majority of the tracks from X, several from Light Years and Fever, one track from Body Language, the ballad version of ""I Believe In You"", a cover of ""Copacabana"" and three unreleased songs (""Ruffle My Feathers"", ""Sometime Samurai"" and ""Flowers"").  Sadly, there is nothing from Impossible Princess, but it's not a huge loss given the rest of the setlist.  Vocally, she's in top form as usual.

My only complaint here is merely a technical aspect of the DVD itself.  The video quality is below average for a DVD concert film. It's a bit on the fuzzy side, which does detract from the stunning visuals in this concert.  They should've mastered this like her KylieFever2002 tour DVD, which is pristine.  The audio, however, is amazing.

Regardless, if you're a Kylie fan and even a little curious to see this show, it's well worth it to purchase this DVD.  Amazon has several versions available (different regional coding), but this particular one is in NTSC format which should play on most American DVD players.  I played it on my PlayStation 3 and it played flawlessly despite the ""Region 3"" badging.",1242864000,3,1713,4.940559440559441
3649619,5,B001IUROPU,"For those of us who have still not been able to see Kylie Minogue in concert, we are grateful that there are several well filmed and produced concerts out there. The newest one, X, does not disappoint. This concert appears to be the most ambitious one yet. In it, there are several costume changes, sets, dancers, and ""glitz"" that Kylie's fans expect. This is a fun, well-paced experience from start to end. Kylie looks fantastic and she sounds great, as well.
I was a little concerned that I would have trouble playing this on my home player but it plays perfectly on my pc as well as home video system. I recommend this highly, particularly for those who love X, as the cd is featured prominently throughout.",1242086400,3,710,4.5984251968503935

3649621,4,B001IUROPU,"While this concert doesn't have the same visuals and highly intense choreography of a madonna gig, she holds out on her own; i actually like the idea of her not doing all that much dancing and focus on singing, which she carries off well - yes, she doesn't lipsync! Nor can you discern any recorded enhancements for vocals. The set and visuals, top notch.

To me, the best moments are the encore numbers where it's just her and the audience. The best thing about this dvd is that it got me listening to her ""x"" cd again, after languishing on my shelf for the past 6 months.",1241222400,,573,4.355140186915888
3649622,5,B001IUROPU,"The musical arrangements from the X CD as well as her past hits are outstanding, the song selections well thought out, and all choreography, costumes, and stage setings simply superb. Without a doubt, this is one of her  best concerts. In addition, the filming of the concert is amazing to watch in High Definition. There are so many memorable performances from the show, but several that come to mind are Speakerphone, WOW, Copacabana, I Believe in You, Your Disco Needs You, In My Arms, and The One. I can't wait to watch it again!",1239667200,8,533,4.670212765957447

Even though there is not a picture for this particular version of the X Tour DVD but I just received it over the weekend and it works just fine.  And let me also mentioned that this particular tour has surpassed all of the ones that I have viewed previously.  I'll just mention to you that you'll see definitely see how she's grown as an artist and performer from her previous tours with the songs selections she uses.  Don't want to give too much away so if you enjoy seeing Kylie live or her DVDs then you'll have to pick this one up.  Discover for yourself and hope that you enjoy!,1238976000,29,732,4.23021582733813
3649624,3,B001IUROPU,"Any crazy Kylie fan, like myself, MUST see this DVD.  There are some great moments, but for some reason the whole show doesn't seem to quite have the fluidity and punch of past recorded tours.  ""X"" does not come anywhere close to the ""Showgirl"" tour, in my opinion.  (Anyone who has not seen a Kylie tour before should see ""Showgirl"" first.)  Towards the end of the show, Kylie sings an entire set of songs on her own, without the backup dancers and spectacle.  This section of the show works the best, it's all about Kylie.  And she really shines when connecting personally to the audience.

On a separate wave length entirely, Madonna and Kylie need to join forces and do a world tour TOGETHER.",1238544000,,696,4.564516129032258

I ordered this from England not knowing if it would work in my players (DVD was Region 2 & PAL video) It not only worked it lets me watch the woman I love in all her glory! I am Kylie's biggest fan in the USA. Not many of us here and she doesn't come here but this way I still get to see her.,1233964800,,330,3.5972222222222223
3649626,5,B001IUROPU,"I've been a Kylie fan for a long time and I have all of her DVD's. I used to think that Showgirl/Homecoming tour was amazing until I saw this one. There is only one word to describe this show, it's SPECTACULAR.

She just gets better and better. She might not be the greatest singer on earth but she always sing LIVE and she CAN sing really well.

The other great thing about the tour is the stage. Especially when they lit up the floor, it looks fantastic. The costumes and the dancers are awesome too (Jason Beitel!).

There are only 2 things that I don't like throughout the show, one of them is Act 4: Naughty Manga Girl. The video Sometime Samurai is too long and I wish she didn't sing Sensitized. The other one is I think 4 songs for the Encore is just too much. They should have left out ""The One"" (I know it wasn't in the set list at most of the shows, I guess she sang it that day because of the DVD shooting.)

Best Performances:

Boombox/Can't Get You Out Of My Head: It's not one of my favourite Kylie songs but I really like how they combined it with Boombox and the background projections are great.

Heart Beat Rock/Wow/Shocked: The whole Cheer Squad theme is really entertaining and fun.

Copacabana: This performance is just amazing. You feel like you're watching a play, so fun.

2 Hearts: I like how she says ""Let me tell you something, I'm in love"" and it's such a colorful performance with the musicians.

Your Disco Needs You: One of my favourite Kylie songs, the last notes are amazing. ""Shall we take it to the opera?""

Step Back In Time: I love how she starts singing acapella and so soft then the music begins and the dancers come to the stage, really good.

You're gonna love this DVD.
(Also, I've ordered this from amazon.co.uk and it's Region 0 not 2.)",1231113600,,1784,4.362537764350453
3649627,5,B001IUROPU,I totally enjoyed watching this concert footage. It's a shame that she isn't all that popular here in the States. But definitely worth spending every dime on the DVD.,1230336000,,166,4.758620689655173
3649628,5,B001IUROPU,"Kylie's really something else. Not only are her albums the best dance pop around, but her shows are more than just concerts: they're theater. Her DVDs are polished, beautifully filmed documents of her always astounding performances. Given her recent illness, it should be no surprise that she eases up a bit on the physical demands she puts on herself, compared with her previous tours. While still gorgeous, she's not as young as she used to be. She still puts herself through a superhuman work-out, but it is a little less than we saw on previous concert DVDs.

As usual, her most recent album's songs are featured heavily in this concert. X has a lot of great stuff on it, so they fit in well with such classics as Spinning Around and Can't Get You Out of My Head. As usual, Kylie SINGS the songs, and a live band (of sickeningly beautiful people) plays most of the music. Kylie's performances are always that much more impressive when you consider that they really are making the music in addition to all the unbelievable choreography.

Like her hit song says: Wow.

(A word to American buyers: Do note that this is a Region 2 DVD. I'm unable to play it in my Sony DVD player, but I can watch it on my laptop.)",1228953600,,1214,4.509090909090909
3649629,3,B001IUROPU,"I'm a big fan of Kylie and almost have all Kylie's dvds. But after I saw this X tour 2008, it was quite disappointing.
1. No matter how good or bad the show is, the production quality of this dvd is NOT good. Quite scene I can tell Kylie's face was blurry, the whole show is not high definition of picture quality,and it's very dark. It's not I'm very picky, but this was compare to all other Kylie's dvds. Can't compare to Showgirl, Fever Tour 2002, Homecoming/White Diamond, or can't compare to Celine Dion's live in Las Vegas at all or any Ayumi Hamasaki's dvds. If you have a LCD TV or nice Flat TV, you can tell a huge difference. After I finished watching this dvd, I put back the Homecoming dvd, WOW everything was so much better!

2. The costumes, considering Gaultier (Madonna) had designed them, were uninspired and quite unflattering at times, that cheerleader get up sent shivers down my spine!! Her Japanese section was a blatant rip off of Madonna's Samurai section from her Drowned World tour in 2001, the song choice also lacked inspiration taking much of its que from the lacklustre disc that was X.

Overall, this dvd still worth watching but do not expect too much if you have seen other Kylie's dvd, even it's a more than 2 hours show. Simply go get Showgirl, Homecoming/White Diamond, or Fever 2002 Tour dvds. All these 3 dvds are so much better than this one. Especially Fever 2002, the beginning of show -the robot space costume with Coming Into My World"" is defintely of the best!",1228867200,,1504,4.546125461254612
3649630,5,B001IUROPU,"I did order""X 2008"" thru amazon.uk (secret, it was cheap ). and I can't stop playing this dvd.
the best female pop artist ever and forever.she is the new CHER.

Amazing performance,amazing voice,amazing grace she has.

My favorites songs, all of them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.But, I love the ""Copacabana"" performance.
The 80's sound from the 'X""  cd is phenomenal.
the skull when she sings ""like a drug"" is very ""WOW""
It is a shame that she is not touring in the USA.Maybe she will sent to the bench  Madonna, Britney,the disney girl, and others pseudo singers, if she perfoms in USA soil!!!!

Just one bad thing, the perfromace of  'the One"" is so dull,but still good.
The image and sound are fantastic.

It is a shame that she is not touring in the USA.Maybe she will sent to the bench  Madonna, Britney,the disney girl, and others pseudo singers, if she perfoms in USA soil!!!!

PS.the dvd was pal, region 0, it won't play in the Sony blu-ray player..but it played in my old dvd phillips upscaling 1080i p. I'm looking for the blu ray in the future.",1228780800,,1044,4.6

8311376,1,B001IUROPU,"If you are a serious Kylie fan, and are familiar with her best concerts like ""Live in Sydney"", or ""Live in Manchester"", do not buy this, it is pitiful. It is Kylie in serious decline, reminiscent of Stevie Nicks, or going way back to Judy Garland. The fire isn't there, the songs uninspiring, and her hips about a foot wider, with costumes like Stevie Knicks used to wear designed to hide her larger aging body. I am throwing my copy away, and keeping the aforementioned ones to remember her by.",1342396800,,495,4.511111111111111
8311377,5,B001IUROPU,"Just got my DVD from Amazon today and watched it...it was AMAZING!!! I've been a Kylie fan since she was ""Charlene"" in the hit Australian show ""Neighbors"", yes that means before her singing career, and no I'm not British or Australian, but an American who was lucky enough to live in England from 87-90, just right when Kylie was about to start her long musical career. Ever since i've came back to the states I hadn't heard anything from Kylie until her Fever album, because the US market stinks! I've been so depraved from Kylie ever since I've come back to the states that I didn't know she had albums between ""Enjoy Yourself"" and ""Fever""! So I try to get all of Kylie's DVD's available for US market. Anyways, prior to this purchase I wasn't too sure to get it cause I thought her X album was ok but nothing compared to Light Years and Fever. Boy, was I glad I purchased this gem. The concert was way above my expectations. Great song selections, love the ""Slow"" version in this concert, really sexy costume changes, and she finishes the concert with one of my favorite oldies from Kylie ""I Should Be So Lucky"", bringing me back in time that it gave me goosebumps. This concert DVD made me go back and listen to my X album and appreciate it more. This is now one of my favorite Kylie DVD's to go with my Kylie collection. So all you Kylie fans and peeps that just love female pop music, I highly recommend this concert DVD, I even got it $10 cheaper here at Amazon for brand spanking new compared to my local music store.",1334793600,,1525,4.392226148409894
8311378,4,B001IUROPU,That it was a nice concert. Kylie also really shows that she can sing. She does it well. Besides that what you go see singers for.,1324080000,,130,4.038461538461538
