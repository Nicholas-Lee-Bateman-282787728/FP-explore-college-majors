7982950,4,B00008G84S,"Low budget flick about a gang of escaped prisoners lead by a serial killing veitnam vet terrorizing a vacationing average American family. I didn't expect much from this film having pulled it from the used bargain bin at a video store, but I found it thoroughly entertaining and well executed for the budget they had to work with, with just enough bad acting, dialog, and scene moments to satisfy the cheesy movie lover in me as well, thumbs up.",1316822400,,445,4.6455696202531644
7982951,3,B00008G84S,This movie is so over the top that it is actually quite entertaining.  The psychotic vietnam vet is so overdone that it takes on a comical flair; with the exception of killings in the food store.  Watch for the peak comic moment when the vet tells everyone to get in the van after shooting Frank Stallone's character -,1227571200,2,318,4.4655172413793105
7982952,3,B00008G84S,"Don't be fooled by the title.  FEAR is not a horror film; it's a 1970s crime/revenge thriller, vaguely similar in theme (if not in tone) to such films as DEATH WISH and DIRTY HARRY.

Emphasis on ""vaguely"" similar.

This is a small film, shot in a California suburb and rural area.  It looks like a low-budget TV movie.

Story is about a young couple (wife played by Kay Lenz) who buy their first house.  Their happiness is soon marred by a criminal who breaks in, and the husband kills the burglar in self-defense.  But he was only a teen (albeit with a long record).  The dead teen's mom is outraged and sues the couple.  The couple may lose the house in the lawsuit.  The media makes the husband look bad.  The police investigate to see if he was too ""trigger happy.""

The husband feels guilty over killing the teen.  The wife feels ""violated"" by the break-in and no longer feels safe in the house.  They feel they're being punished although they were the victims.  Their marriage suffers.

Also, the dead teen's gang friends want revenge.  They harrass the couple.  It's mostly mild stuff, such as skulking about the yard, and throwing trash on their lawn.  I said this was a low-budget film.

Finally, the couple takes a trip to the country to ""get away from it all,"" and the teen's gang friends follow for a final shoot-out.

An okay, albeit small film.",1111881600,3,1358,4.528925619834711
