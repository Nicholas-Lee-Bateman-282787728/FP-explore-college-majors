8043220,5,B0006U3SV2,"Saw is a horror movie that real horror fans will love.  If you like things like BLOODSUCKING FREAKS, BLOOD DINER, DR. BUTCHER M.D., and countless other great horror flicks of the 70's and 80's, you love this.  Not the best acting, but a great script, this movie doesn't scare as much as creep you out.  It's got some good twists, some good gore but it has what alot of dumb movies these days lack, a style of it's own.  Who needs another SCREAM/I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER/CURSED/..fill in your own teeny bobber want-to-horror flick, this is a little better than that.  Some may say that it's a SE7EN rip off, but it's not.  SE7EN was a thriller, this is a straight up horror flick.  So if you want a Oscar type movie, pass on this.  If you want a balls up horror flick that'll make squirm right near the end...GET IT NOW.
By the way, the little kid in this movie, the same girl from SIN CITY, is amazing in this.  When she has a gun to her head and begins to scream...you believe she's really terrified.  She's the best actor in this one (sorry Mr. Glover).",1125187200,,1062,4.291457286432161
8043221,1,B0006U3SV2,"I got this out as I was told it was a real shocker, but I was sorely disappointed. It was badly plotted with poor characterisation, not surprising at all, little or no gore, little suspense and not disturbing in any way at all. A waste of time from start to finish. If you want to be properly scared, try Seven, Black Christmas or Audition. Steer clear of this turkey.",1120089600,,368,4.3478260869565215
8043222,5,B0006U3SV2,"This movie was great, I couldn't sleep for days after seeing, loads of plot twists, an interesting story.  Sure sometimes it seems Carry Elwes is rehearsing British-Shakespean-play voice.  And Danny Glover is as convincing as a duck in a dress, who cares?  Great movie, great story, keeps you guessing, can't wait for a sequel.  And I loved the screenwriter as Adam (people said he couldn't act).  I saw this the same day I saw The Grudge, the Forgotten and the Village and this is the only one of those that actually scares you and keeps you guessing.  Better than 7even, as good as the Ring.",1110758400,,593,4.6
8043223,1,B0006U3SV2,"I should've loved this movie. I didn't. It's really stupid to compare it to a masterpiece like ""The silence of the lambs"". Poor acting really hurts this one. Lacks originality too. Think about it, a whole lot of movies are better than this one.",1110585600,,244,4.568181818181818
8043224,4,B0006U3SV2,"this movie, though it may at first seem like another gorefest without any substance, surprised me. it was clever in some ways, and certain elements recall movies like the cell (for its sheer wierdness), seven, and silence of the lambs. i'd choose this over most of the garbage they put out in theatres these days. highly recommended, especially for the low selling price.",1109980800,,371,4.904761904761905
8043225,5,B0006U3SV2,"and i was blown away i haven't been this moved by a horror movie since Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this is a great refreshing new twist to horror/thriller/mystery pictures. The Jig-Saw killer is the best, and so freekin creepy.  I can't wait untill SAW 2.",1108598400,,252,4.7272727272727275
