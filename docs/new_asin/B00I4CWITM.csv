6250276,5,B00I4CWITM,"I saw this, last year, when it was shown in selected movie theaters here in the U.S.  The sets and costumes are very Gothic (think Tim Burton). The way it was filmed makes the viewer feel as if they are actually sitting in the theater watching a live performance. I'm so excited that it is being released on DVD so that I can view again and again! :-)",1391558400,11,351,4.161764705882353

6250280,4,B00I4CWITM,well done! Dickens novels always make for good movies if their are good directors and good actors. This one suceeded.,1477785600,,117,4.9
6250281,2,B00I4CWITM,Very challenging to follow the movie unless you have read the book in advance. It is a movie of a play so it is all on the same stage with the same props all they change is the lighting from dim to darker to so a change of scenes.,1477526400,,230,3.7142857142857144

6250290,1,B00I4CWITM,I found this rendering of Great Expectations non entertainin. It felt like I was watching a dress rehearsal rather than the finished product.,1461024000,2,141,5.173913043478261
6250291,1,B00I4CWITM,"The director and playwright decided that none of the characters were going to disclaim or speak dialogue. But instead over the top bonkerize every line. Written for juveniles with the IQ of a potato. Overblown, raving, dizzy, ridiculous, immature. A classic deserves at least some respect and it gets none there. If you like this play do yourself a favor and don't tell anyone so.",1459296000,4,380,4.861538461538461
6250292,5,B00I4CWITM,5 stars Absolutely!!!,1457827200,,21,6.333333333333333
6250293,5,B00I4CWITM,It wasn't what I expected....lol. By that I mean the storyline was so creative. Second act was definitely more engaging than the first. I was completely consumed with the plot. I love a play you can't predict. Bravo (smile).,1456531200,,224,4.769230769230769
6250294,4,B00I4CWITM,"A bit abstract due to the theatrical venue and limited scenery. Unless one already knows the story well, I wouldn't recommend but for dedicated Dickens fans it is a great celebration.",1455753600,,183,4.935483870967742
6250295,4,B00I4CWITM,Well done for a stage play.  I studied this book in High School and have always been fascinated by the story.,1454544000,,109,4.190476190476191
6250296,4,B00I4CWITM,"If you are looking for a straightforward adaptation of Great Expectations, this is probably not the version you are looking for.  What this stage production seems to be focused on is presenting a more surreal, emotional experience rather than faithfully recreating the book.  The set design is gothic and minimalist, and the costumes and makeup remind me of something out of a Tim Burton movie.  It was a strange production, not what I was expecting. I don't personally consider this to be a bad thing, but others might.",1449792000,5,520,4.886363636363637

6250301,5,B00I4CWITM,"A great production!  If you are Dickens fan, and even if you are not, it is very touching and captured succinctly the story of orphaned Pip from childhood to adulthood, with all the emotions and drama that accompanied the journey.  I'm very happy I was able to view it!",1446422400,,269,4.469387755102041
6250302,1,B00I4CWITM,Did not make it thru the first 10 minutes.  Am sure it was good but was not appealing to me.,1444176000,,92,3.6
6250303,2,B00I4CWITM,"Interesting interpretation as a play of Dicken's work.  Don't expect a movie.  Even the set doesn't change much.  Reasonable acting, though.  I thought it was still worth the time to watch and I enjoyed it, but I don't think it is everyone's cup of tea.",1444176000,,253,4.555555555555555

6250308,4,B00I4CWITM,"I enjoy watching artists. This was different, extremely different but I enjoyed it. Those who gave it one star are just walled up in older productions, trying to make everyone conform to a vanilla when neopol is how it should be! Spin after spin someones own interpretation!

6250314,4,B00I4CWITM,Stage play that is well written with clear concise acting. The approch used for this classic was a clss act from beginning to final curtain.,1425945600,,140,4.64

6250318,1,B00I4CWITM,Only watched about 15 minutes of this video. It was not what I was expecting and not anything that I wanted to watch. Just too weird.,1407801600,,133,4.153846153846154
6250319,1,B00I4CWITM,Not what I expected. It is a film of a stage play.,1406332800,,50,3.25
6250320,2,B00I4CWITM,This Great Expectations does not use as much language from the book as I prefer.  It is a filmed stage production and they use many modern stage techniques.  I prefer a more traditional rendition.,1403136000,,196,4.735294117647059
6250321,5,B00I4CWITM,"I have never read the book Great Expectations so I cannot say if this series follows it well or not. However, I can say that I loved watching it. There is romance, mystery, murder and more. Watch, you won't be disappointed!",1403136000,,223,4.463414634146342
6250322,2,B00I4CWITM,not enough about the main characters  not nearly as good as ray Winston and Gillian Anderson versions  at timeswhich brought me to tears,1400198400,2,136,4.869565217391305
6250323,5,B00I4CWITM,"A stage production of this novel is inevitably very different from a film. I found this production extremely cleverly executed, and very true to the spirit of the novel, even thought the story was slightly altered. I especially liked the ending, which is the ending that Dickens originally intended.",1398988800,12,299,5.122448979591836
6250324,5,B00I4CWITM,A must own for any Dickens fan. Jo Clifford did an amazing job with this new West End production. I highly recommend it.,1392163200,4,120,4.260869565217392
6250325,5,B00I4CWITM,Was pleasantly surprised by this new production of Great Expectations.  This one is definitely worth adding to your personal collection.,1392163200,,136,5.8
6250326,5,B00I4CWITM,This is an amazing production captured live on stage in London last year - it had a limited engagement in theaters  - a must have for Dickens enthusiasts!,1391817600,,154,4.5

8639202,5,B00I4CWITM,"Wonderful cast playing it! I will highly recommend it for enjoying a Charles Dickens' paly! Great performances!
By the way, I felt that I was actually sitting in the theater watching a live performance. :)",1515110400,,205,4.885714285714286
8639203,2,B00I4CWITM,"A fascinating, highly theatrical production, as long as you're not hoping to have any idea what Dickens was doing in Great Expectations. This adaptation is very creative, but plays fast and loose with the text, the character development, and indeed the plot.  A difference of perspective is all well and good, but (just for example) to make Estella the interpreter of Pip's failings seems positive proof that the adapter of the novel does not know Dickens' characters very well. Indeed, the pop-Freudianism of the opening scene with its ""open the doors of your past"" is, frankly, embarrassingly shallow and anachronistic. High marks for theatricality; not recommended as representative of Dickens' great work.",1505865600,4,709,5.330357142857143
8639204,4,B00I4CWITM,"If you're expecting a ""movie,"" as many of the negative reviewers seemed to do, you won't enjoy this.  This is a video of a 2013 stage version --- a play.  It's all done with one set; scenes differentiated by lighting, not props; and actors playing multiple parts as they appear and disappear into the walls of Miss Havisham's wretched mansion.  If you enjoy theater or at least have had experience watching live actors on stage, and know that you have to suspend disbelief and use your imagination and not expect ""realism,"" then you should appreciate this.  Also, Dickens' villains and fools (which always outnumber his heroes by a long shot), are usually over the top in their mannerisms, and we see that here as well.  Finally, expect outlandish make up designed for audiences in the back row of the theater, not for the small screen.  I found this adaptation to be concise, fast paced for all the material it covers, and very well acted.  And theater lovers will appreciate that like all theater, we are watching actors perform live, not with multiple takes and edits that TV and filmmakers have the luxury of employing to cover up any flubs.  The weakest part of the play is the first 15 or so minutes, which could have been abridged a bit more, but after that, I enjoyed it.  (I streamed this for free using Amazon Prime.)",1499644800,,1327,4.636752136752137
8639205,1,B00I4CWITM,"I had Great Expectations, this movie lowered them.",1496880000,,50,5.375
8639206,3,B00I4CWITM,"I remember watching this when it came out--and I remember being upset because Herbert Pocket was portrayed as one of the ""bad"" guys (who corrupted/influenced Pip), when, in the novel, he is a lovely human being and one of Pip's good friends. It's a decent interpretation otherwise, but I'm #TeamPocket all the way, and they didn't do his character any justice here.",1496448000,,365,4.903225806451613
8639207,1,B00I4CWITM,not the genuine movie of Great Expectations that I expected but a blatantly defective rendition of a staged theater presentation devoid of genuine connection with the original book.,1487721600,,181,5.5
8639208,1,B00I4CWITM,"It may have been a hit on stage, but it did not translate well to to screen. The make-up was terrible for video and the filming looked as though it was done by someone not experienced in filming stage work.",1485561600,,206,4.175
8639209,1,B00I4CWITM,Boring and wordy. We turned it off after about 15 minutes.,1484006400,,58,4.363636363636363
