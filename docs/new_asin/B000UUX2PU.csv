2925315,5,B000UUX2PU,"Sinbad is awesome. He is funny, he's clean, and family friendly. If you like this one, you have to get one of his other DVD's called Sinbad - Afros and Bellbottoms. That one is my absolute favorite. I think he's an inspiration and should be commended for not giving up his values. His preacher father should be very proud of him.",1228780800,6,329,4.409836065573771
2925316,5,B000UUX2PU,I enjoy all of Sinbad's dvds.  I have purchased all three that are available and have not been disappointed in any of them.  The content is clean and family friendly; which is a refreshing change for what people call comedy of today.  He falls in the category of Bill Cosby in that it doesn't have to talk like filth to be funny.  I recommend it for the entire family.,1220227200,14,368,4.2898550724637685
2925317,5,B000UUX2PU,"This was great comedy from Aruba, anyone that likes sinbad or clean humor then I strongly suggest picking this up.",1214956800,5,114,4.75
2925318,5,B000UUX2PU,Sinbad is very Funny. It's the things I remember for my past that is ture. The hole family can see.,1211068800,4,99,4.0
2925319,5,B000UUX2PU,"As always, Sinbad delivers nothing but laughs! I love how he exposes the funny in any subject without having to use harsh language. Definitely a keeper! All three of his released stand-ups are worth the time over and over!",1203897600,17,222,4.717948717948718
2925320,4,B000UUX2PU,"I recently had a memory pop into my head of Sinbad speaking to a bunch of people out in the open.  I couldn't remember where it was shot, but luckily enough, the description here on Amazon listed the location, so I had to get the DVD.

This is a fun stand-up, and Sinbad talks about relationships, black culture (don't worry, you'll still get it even if you're white), family, and various other realms.  The comedy holds up well after all these years, but some younger kids may not fully get where Sinbad's coming from.  Regardless, everyone will get a kick out of this show.  You'll find it rather enjoyable, and for the cheap price, if you're thinking about getting it, you might as well go for it.  You will laugh!",1203206400,18,717,4.476923076923077
2925321,5,B000UUX2PU,This is comedy at it's best that the entire family can enjoy.  Sinbad is a wonderful comedian who can make the crowd laugh without using profanity.  Bravo!,1198713600,9,155,4.703703703703703
2925322,5,B000UUX2PU,i've been searching for this forever. i cant believe its finally being released. i watched it when i was really young on HBO. from what i remember it was really funny.,1193443200,8,167,4.419354838709677

2925326,5,B000UUX2PU,Great,1432684800,,5,5.0
2925327,5,B000UUX2PU,I dare you not to laugh! I have several of Sinbad's DVDs and I laugh and laugh even though I've watched them over and over. He's one of the few comediennes that can make you laugh WITHOUT using profanity. It takes a genius to do that! Way to go Sinbad.,1428710400,,252,4.06
2925328,2,B000UUX2PU,NO GOOD,1418601600,,7,3.0
2925329,3,B000UUX2PU,I just love Sinbad.  He is too funny.,1407715200,,37,3.625
2925330,4,B000UUX2PU,"Good down to earth clean comedy, Sinbad proves that you don't need foul language on any stand up routine to make the masses laugh.  Compared to Afros & Bell Bottoms, this comedy routine is a couple of notches below.  Afros and Bell Bottoms is very funny and still keeps the routine clean!",1384732800,,288,4.519230769230769
2925331,5,B000UUX2PU,Sinbad is still very funny.  He tells it like it is and makes you laugh in the process.  Hes absolutely hilarious.,1366588800,,114,4.380952380952381
2925332,5,B000UUX2PU,Like Sinbad because he is not an explicit comedian and he still is funny and talented.  Makes me laugh alot.,1362355200,2,108,4.4
2925333,1,B000UUX2PU,"I love Sinbad but this wasn't even funny!  I could not believe he actually made and released this video.  I watched it all the way thru even though I was ready to dump it 15 minutes in.  It never got any better, very disappointing!",1361923200,,231,4.204545454545454
2925334,2,B000UUX2PU,"I bought this one because of a previous one I had gotten and it was not as funny or fun as that one, so I was disappointed in it.
I guess I didn't care that much about ""the Funk"" but for those who do, have at it, this ones for you.",1358812800,,231,3.549019607843137
2925345,5,B000UUX2PU,"Sinbad is a wonderful comedian.  He takes everyday things we can identify with and makes them funny.  Clean act, too.",1357084800,4,117,4.8
2925346,5,B000UUX2PU,"Sinbad is absolutely hysterically funny without being foul or vulgar.  Not one swear word or inappropriate innuendo, totally family friendly, but so darned FUNNY that this left me in stitches.  Excellent video to show at a party, family get together or just with friends hanging out.  Every DVD of his has hilarious insights into male-female relations, but with not one repeat of material.  This guy sees into the humor of the dymamics with a fresh perspective every time and leaves you saying, ""Yep, that's me!"" or ""I've done that!"" while rolling on the floor cracking up. The only thing that surprised me was that he didn't use ""We Want the Funk"" by Parliament as the song when he was musically describing what ""Funk"" was. But the song he used, ""To Be Real"" was good anyway. A must purchase if you like to laugh!!!",1355011200,2,816,4.685314685314685
2925347,3,B000UUX2PU,I love watching Sindbad. I loved his DVD titled Where U Been? However this one Nothin' But The Funk didn't do it for me. It wasn't as funny as his other ones. Then again that's just my opinion.,1334966400,,193,4.105263157894737
2925348,5,B000UUX2PU,As always Sinbad delivers! This DVD is hilarious and we've watched it several times. It is one of our favorites to play during parties because everyone cracks up.,1319846400,,162,4.821428571428571
2925349,1,B000UUX2PU,"Bought this DVD based upon his work ""Where U Been"" which made me laugh out loud and often.  Unfortunately, this performance was not very funny and quite dissapointing.",1315958400,,167,4.964285714285714
2925350,5,B000UUX2PU,Sinbad is one of the few comedians that has the ability to make you laugh but still be family friendly.  He doesn't use swear words and his matieral is just hilarious. I recommend any of his videos.,1299974400,,198,4.351351351351352
2925351,5,B000UUX2PU,"We truly enjoyed Sinbad 's ""Nothing But The Funk"".",1299110400,,50,4.666666666666667
2925352,4,B000UUX2PU,"This is a great DVD.  Sinbad is so talented. But as others have commented some of these dvds have been edited quite severely, and I have no clue why they would do such a thing.  This one is still great though and I didn't notice as much editing as some of the others.",1296864000,,267,4.018867924528302
2925353,5,B000UUX2PU,I am trying to find Sinbad's take on how dancing has changed through the years.  I saw the comedy special once and laughed so hard I was crying. Plese help.,1290038400,,156,4.2
2925354,4,B000UUX2PU,"He reminds of the ""cut-ups"" in my class in school back in the day!-I have them all and you can watch with friends and family and not be embarassed!!!",1287100800,,149,4.172413793103448
2925355,5,B000UUX2PU,"I got this as a gift for my son, he kept telling his sons about Sinbad. I love his comedy programs as they are rated G but still sooooo funny! Even my young grandsons were laughing out loud!",1282003200,,190,4.026315789473684
2925356,3,B000UUX2PU,Th comedy was funny but the filming was not so great they cut off his head and with Sinbad his facial expression is part of his act so that was dissapponting,1280016000,3,157,4.096774193548387
2925357,1,B000UUX2PU,"Hey , I like Sinbad alot . I have Afro and Bellbottoms and Where Have You Been and some HBO VHS recordings that are not available on DVD. So when I ordered 'nothing but the funk' ,I thought it was much of the same routine I'm used to , being a New York inner city kid (now 53yrs old), but.... it was a big let down for me and my wife. Nothing like the Sinbad I was used . There was nothing funky about it , the only reference to funk was at the end and the music they used in the finale (that they called funk music) wasn't funk music at all. Why was it called 'Nothin but the Funk' ????? It should have been called ' Nothing at all to do with Funk !!!!! Anyway I plan to sell this DVD cheap or give it away because I'm sure I'm not going to watch this again. It fell funk flat in my book.",1276473600,2,789,3.787878787878788
2925358,4,B000UUX2PU,"Nice and clean, good to add to the collection... now just to get Brain Damaged!",1272326400,,79,4.333333333333333
2925359,5,B000UUX2PU,Rec'd DVD in a timely manner. I saw the original when it came out on HBO and I wanted to add it to my collection.,1272326400,,113,3.56
2925360,1,B000UUX2PU,I DID NOT LIKE THIS DVD. IT WAS NOT FUNNY. NOT LIKE SINBAD: SON OF A PREACHER MAN OR SINBAD: AFROS AND BELLBOTTOMS.,1271894400,,115,4.043478260869565
2925361,2,B000UUX2PU,"The movie was ok, but it was not what I was looking for. Not a large selection.",1262131200,,79,3.7058823529411766
2925362,4,B000UUX2PU,"If you enjoy clean fun, then you will enjoy Sinbad. I was able to enjoy this with my children in the house and not have to worry what Sinbad may say. It is great for any get-togethers.",1258070400,,184,4.0
2925363,5,B000UUX2PU,I try to get all of Sinbad's shows because being a wholesome person and a family man you need comedies like Sinbad's so that all could watch,1243036800,6,140,4.222222222222222
