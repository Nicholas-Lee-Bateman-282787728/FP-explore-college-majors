2383218,4,B000AA4F88,I adored the beginning of this. Two young French girls (Anna and Francoise) are driving through the countryside and decide to spend the night in an abandoned cottage. Music/location/dialogue and cinematography are excellent. Then Anna disappears. The film loses its magic soon afterwards and I ended up fast forwarding a lot due to boredom. But still ... watch the beginning. I've never seen anything like it. A treat for the eyes and ears :),1158192000,9,442,4.986486486486487
2383219,1,B000AA4F88,"As a sex sleaze fan you have to like a movie where the first frame is the skin of a naked bound girl, don't you?  The only drawback is immediately thereafter we're introduced to a real hag that haunts the rest of the film, Morgana herself, who unfortunately does not resemble the giant hose-bagged heroine we all know and love, but rather a kind of manly dwarf.

Nevermind, that's what video editing is for.  The plot is pretty standard, pretty girls get lost in their car, find a pile of hay and immediately proceed to lez out.  One of them finds a mystical boat (ala The Holy Grail, but the music isn't as good) and is immediately whisked off to an island where she promptly falls into a pile of naked girls.  She takes a little hit off a hookah and finds herself all tied up in purple ropes, ready to be abused.

Then . . . it all turns to mush.  There's a couple more scenes of lezzing out in diaphonous robes and that's it.  No blood, no whipping, no bugger all.  86 minutes of zilch.  At least it's in french so you don't have to listen to the plot.  The minimum one star for the nudity, but I'd really give it zero if I could, what's nudity count for these days?",1138924800,30,1169,4.197309417040358
2383220,5,B000AA4F88,"This is a wonderful piece of French fantasy, never seen in this country before. It bears many similiarities to Jean Rollin (2 girls trapped in a castle, roads that are endless circles, lesbianism, the use of the French countryside, ruins, even a graveyard. Plus 2 of the actresses acted for Rollin), but weaves its own charm. The print is immaculate and beautifully transferred, and the girls are beautiful.

If you're in the mood for an offbeat fantasy spiced with some nudity and soft core, you won't be disappointed.",1127260800,49,519,4.8977272727272725

Morgan La Fey runs this place, and in return for their soul, will grant everlasting beauty and life to those who stay. Unedited, and quite good, liked the ending.",1456444800,,270,4.76595744680851

8076734,4,B000AA4F88,"A strange, low key, erotic film that has magic, fantasy, lovely women, gothic ambiance and fairytale like qualities. One of the more interesting aspects of it, is the movie has a very natural and earthy ambience to it because of it's actual on-location shooting in a real castle, while the delivery of the tale is very theatrical. The movie LOOKS great - for locations, set design, 70s hairstyles, soft pastel colors and soft flesh. Some people might find it slow, but it is a very dream-like film with a lot of nice touches. Often re-releases like these are classified in narrower genres - for instance, this movie would be labelled under HORROR! But it really isn't. It is a gothic fantasy and it's more specific label would be Erotic Fantasy - a style of movie that doesn't really exist anymore. I might call it some kind of pagan matriarchy film!",1403049600,4,850,4.673333333333333

GIRL SLAVES OF MORGANA LE FAY is a calmly paced but compelling piece of erotic horror for the arthouse. Its a beautiful movie, to kick off with its surface aesthetics. On that count alone, it warrants praise. The setting and creative camera use of said setting, plus the elegant but not ornate costuming - paralleling the quiet but riveting nature of the film - make this a work of art strictly in terms of visual construction. But beyond that, the films tale, though simple, is gripping. Its an old idea, but powerful, and well employed herein. Two women on a drive take a detour not to the Twilight Zone, but to the mystical realm of Morgana Le Fay, the original wicked witch, infamous relative of King Arthur. Of course, GIRL SLAVES OF MORGANA LE FAY isn't interested in the Arthurian cycle, only the immediate idea of Morgana Le Fay. I don't know how much of this story is drawn from legend and how much is reinvention by the filmmaker, Bruno Gatillon, but it doesnt matter. Morgana is a daunting, alluring and fearful character, and a worthy antagonist for this tale of dilemma: immortality in thrall to Morgana or freedom doomed to die? The film is peopled with a few great side characters, particularly the dwarf or hunchback or whatever and the three henchwomen (?) who serve at Morganas side. Then there are, of course, our two lost souls, the girls on a drive who made a left turn at the intersection of real and fantasy. Their character arcs are complementary but vastly different. This ones a solid film all the way around: brilliant cinematography, artful erotica, psychospiritual horror that chills the gut, philosophical thoughtfulness, lucid direction and a knack for beautiful simplicity. GIRL SLAVES OF MORGANA LE FAY is both enchanting and ominous, a mix of beauty and fear - exactly what you expect from quality erotic horror.",1362268800,6,1868,4.858934169278997
8076736,3,B000AA4F88,"While vacationing in Auvergne, pretty French girls Francoise and Anna stumble upon a mysterious castle inhabited by the beautiful Morgana Le Fay (of King Arthur mythology).  She, along with her creepy dwarf, Gurth, soon become obsessed with Francoise and Anna.  Morgana requires the souls of females to continue her immortal life, and now Morgana'a got her eyes on them.",1265846400,,370,5.254237288135593
8076737,3,B000AA4F88,"Well, this movie is just okay. Not bad, not great. Lotsa eye candy, no real gore, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. It is kind of boring, but if you don't pay too much for it you should be satisfied. My copy ended up being traded in at my local half price books, but overall I'm glad I saw it once.",1257206400,,311,3.8
8076738,5,B000AA4F88,"This movie was truly wonderful. I loooooved the ending, so French in that it wasn't spelled out. I thought about this movie for days after renting it, the lead actress was so beautiful and enchanting, and the actress that played Morgane was so poised and sinister. I absolutely loved the images. Morgane le Fay is one of my favorite stories in literature, this is a classic!!!",1193616000,5,376,4.712121212121212
8076739,5,B000AA4F88,"One reviewer here seems to have gotten it all wrong about Morgana.  She is a fox among a den of foxes.  The crone-looking character is actually a dwarf man in the film who serves as Morgana's second in command, but I can see why ""somebody"" made the error--the opening scenes are highly distracting, the confusion stemming from the rather delightful sight of a bound, pleading, naked woman.  That sort of thing tends to focus your attention away from other details, large and small. I'm sorry, but this movie is well worth seeing in all its cheesy glory--it's a pure erotic romp.  Some of the nude scenes are positively enthralling, and for that reason alone it warrants top tier rating.  Without getting too graphic, it's worth pointing out that some of the breasts in this film ought to be immortalized in marble.  One absolutely priceless sequence has the ""woman in jeopardy"" fleeing Morgana's castle wearing nothing but a diaphanous baby-doll negligee.  What more could a guy ask for but to see an equisitely leggy fawn such as her fleeing franticly through the forest in a skimpy see-through frock at daybreak?  And then to witness this distressed nymph swimming through the frigid waters surrounding the castle?  It is all close to being just too much.  There are few ""woman in jeopardy"" comparisons to rival this one.  In my heterosexual eyes, there is nothing on God's green Earth quite like seeing a nubile, shivering beauty in a wet nighty emerging from a lake at sunrise, even if it has to be in a movie.  It's enough to make you want to lie down and die.  As a bonus, people who like to see women in love will definitely like this movie, and those parts of the film are done well.  Not being a fan of that sort of action, those scenes still impressed me with their erotic fineness. The director certainly had an eye for that kind of thing. And the story is not bad either.  Five stars!",1174435200,37,1896,4.617910447761194
