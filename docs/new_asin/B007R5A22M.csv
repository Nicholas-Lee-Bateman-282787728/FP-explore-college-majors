5105116,3,B007R5A22M,"Not much material included was any different than previously released videos. Forme, it was just nice to have them on DVD instead of my old VHS items",1356480000,3,149,4.555555555555555
5105117,3,B007R5A22M,"2 of the dvds i already have from other mets dvds, but overall i liked it, loved the season highlights",1356307200,,102,4.15
5105118,3,B007R5A22M,"I agreee with the previous reviewers, not enough unque content. Only the 2000 NLCS Game 5 and 1969 WS Game 3 are new to this set, having not been released on DVD previously. Regarding the previous reviewer's comment about SNY showing all of the games from 1969 WS, those games have also been shown on MLB network, in more complete form there than on SNY. I do not beleive that the 2000 NLCS Game 5 has ever been rebroadcast anywhere, so that is the most valuable piece to me.

OTOH, this is the third set for 1986 WS Game 6, having already been included in the 1986 WS set, and the essential games of Shea Stadium set. The 1986 WS set suprisingly did not contain the 1986 WS film (short, at only 30 mins), so I think this is that film's first appearance on DVD.

So not at all worth the list price of $99 (especially if you own the other sets), but it might worth throwing on my Christmas list to see if anyone bites at $29.99. If you do not own either previous Mets DVD set (1986 WS/Essential Games of Shea), then a good buy at $29.99.",1353283200,6,1036,4.201005025125628
5105119,3,B007R5A22M,"This could have been great. Combine all of the yearly highlight films,throw in some great games from the vault[there has to be some Seaver games extant }Throw in the WS and LCS that exist. Show some of the original broadcast team Kiners Korner. Well, that is not happening here...As a previous reviewer has stated,this set exists in other forms on other sets. The highlight films from various years do exist[they play on SNY as Mets yearbook] and SNY has broadcast all of the 5 WS games from 1969[albeit the first two on black and white} this set, again desultory in its make-up,proves that the fools at MLB are as clueless as the owner-Commissioner { I know he sold the team,to his family. He was still an owner commissioner. And an ass }.Next time consult a fan. This is a set for met fans who think Endy Chavez' catch in the 2006 LCS was one of the 5 great moments in team history. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1347408000,19,930,4.676829268292683
5105120,2,B007R5A22M,"I have been waiting to see what would be included in this set and its a great disapointment. 4 out of the 5 games have already been released on other Mets DVD sets. The higlights films from the early years are interesting but still not worth the price if you have the other Mets DVD sets.
All the games from the 1969 World Series do exist in fairly decent shape. Why couldn't MLB release that entire Series instead of one game on a previous set and one game on this set.",1346371200,24,470,4.175824175824176

8521196,5,B007R5A22M,This was a Christmas Gift for my Brother-In-Law who is a Mets Fan (Why I do NOT know).  It was the perfect gift idea and I was glad to have found it!,1420761600,,149,3.65625
8521197,3,B007R5A22M,"I agree.  I've been waiting for the MLB to release the Entire 1969 World Series for a long time.  But, The longer they wait, the less interest there will be in reliving those great games.  I also wish SNY would relase those video Yearbook they produce on DVD.  That was a very well produced series.",1389398400,2,298,4.363636363636363
8521198,5,B007R5A22M,"This is a must for any Mets fan. This collection covers the N Y Mets from there inception as an expansion team in 1962 to the 2006 season. You will get to see the early Mets such as Marvelous Marv Thornberry and Tom Seaver from his rookie 1967 season. You get to see the immortal 1969 NY Championship Mets and that wonderful,magical 69 season. You will also see the incredible 1973 ""you gotta believe"" season and there trip to the world series. They lost in the 7th game. You will see the great team of 86 and that world series as well. Many,many Met highlights.

It will make a great gift for that Met fan in your family for christmas. The packaging is real nice as well as the color booklet. Worth every penny.",1385942400,2,858,4.302469135802469
8521199,4,B007R5A22M,Great collection. Would've liked to see 1973 NLCS Game 3. (The Rose/Harrelson fight) and 1973 WS Game 2. The 12 inning epic.,1365120000,4,124,4.681818181818182
8521200,4,B007R5A22M,The product is as advertised. Why is everyone complaining? Don't buy it if you think it's a rehash or not what you want. It's called the marketplace. Great product for all the memories. Enjoyed it very much...otherwise I would not have bought it.,1364083200,,246,4.744186046511628
8521201,4,B007R5A22M,"I echo some of the previous reviewers on this 10 DVD set. It's really pretty good although it could've been better in some respects. I'm an avid Mets fan like many here who would buy this & some of the material on this is particularly wonderful because it's never been available commercially before (1969 World Series Game 3 & 2000 NLCS Game 5). The 2 winning official World Series films of '69 & '86 were wise to include. The 25th anniversary film (updated version through 1988 season) is here too, excellent choice. The recent ""50  Greatest Mets"" which was released separately is also in this, bonus material & all, terrific decision. Highlight films or videos of 1963 season, '69, '73, '78, '88, '90, '00 & '06 are here. Here's where reasonable folks could begin to question some of the stuff present. Where's the 1986 highlight film, ""A Year To Remember""? A great one hour VHS video that's never been officially converted to DVD yet. How about 1999 when they went to Game 6 of NLCS? I don't know why these couldn't have been included. I was disappointed that some truly hidden gem like the 1973 NLCS Game 5 NBC broadcast couldn't have been possibly unearthed, but these things might not exist anymore, unfortunately. (Also I must say, some of the highlight films (like 1988) are the edited 30 minute versions shown on SNY cable TV channel. C'mon. You have to put the whole film on here!). The other games shown have already been available to buy previously & shown numerous times on SNY's ""Mets Classics"" (1986 NLCS Game 6, 1986 World Series Game 6 & 9/21/01, first game in New York after 9/11). The packaging that this is in is absolutely stunning, a beautiful book with great color pictures, very handsome. So as stated, if you are a big Mets rooter & don't have most of these items on DVD already, I do recommend getting this, especially at reduced prices.",1361059200,8,1863,4.6454545454545455

8521203,5,B007R5A22M,"Very happy with this set! There should be more vintage games released on DVD every year... it would make the long, cold winters between baseball seasons seem shorter :-)",1356652800,,169,4.862068965517241
