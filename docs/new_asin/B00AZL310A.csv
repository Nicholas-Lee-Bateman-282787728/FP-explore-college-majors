5531089,4,B00AZL310A,"There is always some well meaning male relative and or friend that want to bring our young boys up to speed and mean well because yes, life is unique for them to say the very least and they got to know what they are going to face as time moves on. but sometimes I feel a child should stay a child as long as he or she can without facing the harsh realities life has to offer. In this movie, it's no different. Common plays an ex con named Vincent just outta prison who takes his young nephew to school but decides at the last minute to take him along with him while he goes around town handling business. Young fella gets to see a lot more of life than he would have seen in school on a given day. At the base of the uncle's plan is trying to open a crab bar that he can work with and stay on the straight and narrow. In order to get what he needs to make that dream come through, he has to once again embrace the life he left behind in the form of Dennis Haysbert and Danny Glover, as well as his old homie, Charles S.Dutton. In the meantime, young nephew is wondering about his mother who they won't tell him about but let him know that she is away in N.C. handling some ""things"". As the story unfolds, you kind of wish that young homie went to school instead of hanging with unc. no lie.also,if your going to take your nephew or young family member around and show him things, be sure to tell the ""whole dang story"" like, the real deal on his mother,your part in that, what you did to make that happen instead of covering it up. just IMHO. good flick.",1365897600,11,1554,4.0816993464052285

Common plays his role superbly, unfortunately the character development falls short and leaves the viewer wondering how did this all happen. It's like they've just told us the end of the story when in fact if they would've told us the whole story we could have appreciated the movie more. The movie could have easily been two hours and much more enjoyable. However, the summary of Vincent, Woody, Mr Fish' lives is told in a powerful climatic film. The relationship between Vincent and Woody is palpable. Overall a good movie, starts a bit slow but is interesting.",1359072000,3,661,4.64957264957265

5531139,4,B00AZL310A,"For one, the soundtrack was awesome.

I didn't feel much for any of the characters really, but when V starts talking about Frederick Douglas, I feel like his struggle to move beyond his past is connected to an historical perspective that encompasses or incorporates his struggle, which I thought was a pretty cool way to infuse that theme into the story.

Another thing that caught my attention is when V is telling Enoch that he's from P.G. and only in and out of Baltimore.  Since I'm from the area, I understood but I doubt the average person would comprehend what he meant by PG.  Throwing that in I thought was great.  (PG is short for Prince Georges County which is south of Baltimore outside DC... at least I think that's what he meant).",1387411200,,744,4.56390977443609

Here is my issue, you take your nephew with you to witness your dirty dealings . Then you put cold  black Steele in  his hand and basically try to turn him into a monster.. Tisk, Tisk

5531156,2,B00AZL310A,"Eleven-year-old Woody (Michael Rainey, Jr.) lives with his grandma (Lonette McKee). He's missing his mother and he's always thinking about the day when he'll see her again. There is no father around, but his Uncle Vincent (Common) is back after serving time in prison.

I will begin with this: Michael Rainey, Jr. is a talented young man. His performance was excellent. And Common gave a good performance.

Common's character, Vincent: He wanted to start his own business. That was admirable. But from the time he left the breakfast table, I could not stop shaking my head at this man. The choices he made concerning Woody and things he said to his nephew disappointed me at times, and then I became bothered and then angry and I began to fuss at the screen. I thought he wanted a better life. I thought he was going to teach his nephew valuable life lessons. Instead, he introduced Woody to a world he should have kept him away from. Far, far away. He allowed Woody to listen to conversations he should have never heard, to see things he should have never seen, and to experience something that I'm surprised didn't traumatize the ""little man"". Vincent may have thought about his life while he was incarcerated, but he still had serious issues.

There are good actors in this movie - Lonette McKee, Danny Glover, Dennis Haysbert, Charles S. Dutton, Russell Hornsby, Michael K. Williams, Common - and that's why I decided to watch, but I expected good messages for young black men. There weren't any. That was very disappointing.",1372982400,,1529,4.784090909090909
5531157,3,B00AZL310A,"***1/2

Artfully directed by Sheldon Candis,"" LUV"" is a compelling, low-budget tale of Vincent, a recently released convict who takes his young nephew, Woody, on a day-long excursion through Baltimore to give him lessons on how to survive in the urban jungle that is his home (Woody's mother lives in North Carolina while his grandmother is currently raising him in Maryland). This includes, among other things, teaching him how to drive and how to shoot a gun. But the main focus is on Vincent's attempts to go straight and to secure a loan for a restaurant he wants to open. But the young man soon discovers that it isn't all that easy to cut the ties with one's criminal past, and Woody bears witness to some pretty horrendous events throughout the course of the day.

Taken as a whole, ""LUV"" is considerably less than the sum of its parts. The screenplay by Candis feels strangely doughy and underdeveloped, often leaving us bewildered as to what exactly Vincent is up to and who it is he's interacting with at any given moment. That being said, ""LUV"" manages to hold our interest due to the immediacy of its style and the naturalism of its performances. Common makes us care about Vincent; we see him as an ambitious young man who, despite his natural inclination towards crime - an inclination obviously resulting from the difficult circumstances in which he was raised - appears to be genuinely trying to turn his life around. That the world and his past seem to be conspiring against him is what makes the tale so poignant. Vincent may not be the perfect role model for his young nephew, but he is probably the best the boy is going to have for the foreseeable future.

But it is young Michael Rainey, Jr., in a star-making performance as Woody, who walks off with the film. Even at the tender young age of eleven, Rainey is already a natural in front of the camera and it is his wholly believable reactions to what is taking place around him that strike a responsive chord in the viewer. Indeed, we are willing to go on this structurally awkward and artistically uneven journey simply for the privilege of reveling in his performance. Rainey, in essence, becomes the thread holding all these seemingly random and arbitrary events together. One looks forward to great things from him in the future.",1372291200,,2306,4.702970297029703

5531159,3,B00AZL310A,"The program for the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival selection states that this shy 13-year-old boy learns some harsh lessons. My main concern was: What did he really learn over the course of this violent, bloody day? (This film is not yet rated.) After discussing this with other audience members, we were unclear....

We watched:
  * Michael Rainey Jr. (""Un Altro Mondo"" for which he learned to speak Italian) is our hero, living with his grandmother and dazzled by his smooth-talking, fine-dressing, handsome ex-con uncle, who helps him ditch school for the day.
  * Common (""New Year's Eve"") is slick Uncle Vincent who refuses to work for anyone else, he wants to be his own boss. Since he got out of prison, he hasn't made many friends, so he takes his hero-worshiping little nephew along to ""learn the ropes.""
  * Dennis Haysbert (""The Unit"") is one of the brothers Uncle Vincent visits with his wide-eyed nephew in tow.
  * Danny Glover (""Mysteria"") is in charge of the deal that allegedly will make Uncle Vincent rich enough to start his own crab shack on the waterfront in Baltimore.
  * Michael Kenneth Williams (Omar in ""The Wire"") is a Baltimore cop who is hot on the trail of Uncle Vincent and his nervous nephew.
  * Lonette McKee (""Dream Street"") is our little hero's grandmother. She knows her son is lying in his teeth even as she signs the papers for that second mortgage.

As this violent day draws to a close, our thirteen year old has learned how to wear a suit, shoot a gun and drive a car. I realize he's still a child, but when I considered his situation just before the final credits, I'm afraid he might have learned the wrong lessons.

8559726,2,B00AZL310A,"At first take-picking the movie up to review it in the store,I thought that it would be an intriguing immediate[ Grab Your Attention] must watch...NOT SO!!!

I was sadly shamed & disappointed after watching this movie in it's entirety.
To start off,This is just another LOW BUDGET film (In My Opinion)w/some A-List star actor's. The dialogue alone in this movie is lackluster to say the least & the plot was not at all very well developed. The movie itself leaves you guessing as to what happened w/the rest of the scripts & scenes in the film & also the flow of LUV is not consistent all the way thru. The title alone does not even match nor equal up to what's presented thru out the movie which at some point you would think that for a movie w/an alformentioned name title such as LUV would come off as a movie descripted w/some kind of emotional filled plot whether it be bad or good...NOT!!!
It's sort of your typical everyday life reality urban street [Black Man Gets Out Of Prison & Tries To Reform Himself Yet Fails] film.
Here we have COMMON portraying the image of a now ex felon VINCENT who just came home from prison after doing a 8 year sentence.
Woody {Michael Rainey Jr.} an inspiring up & coming actor who plays Common's 11 years old nephew lives w/his grandmother,
Actress {Loretta Mckee} longs to have his family be reunited.
One moring instead of Vincent (Common)dropping his nephew off to school,he rather decides to take his nephew on a journey w/him for the day as he travels about handling  business. Woody jumps at the chance of joining his father figure in a day of venture which will all soon enough change.
His plans are to become the owner of a crab shack restaurant in the city of Baltimore's Inner Harbor Waterfront. Baltimore is where the movie takes place & is filmed.

Vincent (Common)decides to give his nephew a tutorial along the way on how a man is suppose to handle business & get things done. Their time together quickly changes from optimistic to desperate as Vincent's plans to open up his crab shack restaurant is crushed. His past life of crime comes back into play to haunt him & remind him of how he can only succeed in accomplishing having things by getting it the illegal wrong way.
In the midst of things his nephew Woody winds up sadly experiencing & discovering a lot of things that some kids at the age of 11 years old never witness. In the end things turn ugly & Woody is forced to make some crucial decisions that place him in a situation to go against even his own flesh & blood uncle.

Not to give away too much of the movie for those who still wish to make a purchase on it. Overall for this movie to have such known actors & actress as it namely does yet renders a performance of a c-class film is definitely borderline unacceptable.
You be the judge of it for yourself...I own this movie & this is definitely one movie that is disappointing that I will likely never pick up off of my movie shelf to watch again.",1465776000,,2968,4.460405156537753

Again I am struck by what passes for being a ""man"" to some. Doing for yourself is not a factor. The ex-con charms his mother into signing for a loan for him and then decides to go back to his old ways one last time before going legit with a dinner club when he finds out he needs additional funds for his startup. When his old crime boss won't loan him the money, Vincent agrees to some illegit biz...and nearly loses his life (after being warned and pushing forward nevertheless) all under the gaze of an 11-yr. old. At no point does he perceive getting his nephew home a priority, that this is no place for a child, no, he makes use of him under the guise of ""lessons in life, for your own good.""  Selling the Mercedes to raise the money never occurs to him.  No, actually BEING legit and the effort and time it takes is not half as important as APPEARING legit (wearing a suit, driving a luxury car yet using an AKA, dishonesty, family trust to get his way & get ahead, stealing the flowers, assaulting his exGF's new man, etc.). The problem with the Vincents of the world is he sees no other way of being, no alternative, not for him, not for his nephew. Being legit is just wallpaper.
