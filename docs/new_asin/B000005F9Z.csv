1184579,5,B000005F9Z,This is one of the best films I've ever seen. It reminds me a lot of 8 1/2 from Fellini but in a Cuban context.,1231200000,,111,3.48
1184580,5,B000005F9Z,"Everything remains without any change. The real essence of the underdevelopment is precisely the incapability of growing up, transformation and even more to innovate.

The real is may well identified thanks its own strength and its effectiveness, by its fast ability to react and act. The real is inimitable, the false is unchanging.

This film reveals so much more than you can really expect. It' s a work which works out at several levels. Through the personal portrait of an outlaw Cuban, without financial problems, decides to stay in the early sixties to watch what it happens. In fact he becomes in a real sociological peeping tom and somehow he doesn't seem to realize the immense spider web that slowly goes involving him. Bitter and sharp reflections through a voice in off will be accompanied by an unscrupulous and valiant camera that will show you the faces, the surroundings and the quotidian behavior of a inexpressive faces as sinister ghosts who just walk without dreams.

Watch this movie. It is a historical document and a powerful statement. It useless to affirm this is the masterpiece of Tomas Gutierrez Alea, the same director of Strawberry and chocolat.",1107302400,3,1176,4.989795918367347
1184581,4,B000005F9Z,"According to most ""critics"" this is one of the best movies ever. Pretty strong statement but not without some validity. An excellent movie to watch in terms of techniques used to get a point across. I enjoyed it but felt like I was sitting in one of my old communication film classes. When it was over I thought a prof might materialize and say "" what do you think Tomas Gutierrez Alea was trying to say when Sergio......?"" The thing about this movie is that there is so much going on, constantly flowing, never stoping, the drums are beating to a frenzy as the images are flashed before your eyes, it can be a bit much. Part propaganda piece, part romance, intellectual stimuli, a little of this and little of that made for a smorgasborg of cinema. While going through the cinema buffet the viewer is treated to glimpses of authentic historical footage. For starters the hungary film viewer may feast there eyes on fleeing family memebers after the Revolution, followed by the playboy of Havana in search of a young pidgeon. Moving along the cinema buffet line, the viewer will find romance, distraught lovers, rekindled affairs of the heart, and the consequences of societies handling of affairs between a young, naive girl and her seducer. Since there is always more than on can eat at a buffet, you might get tired and need a little nap before resuming your cinema course. There are no times for naps but Cuban music and dancing will  be provided for your entertainment. Resuming your place in the film buffet don't miss the  fast and furious view of Cuba without Batista. Be sure to treat yourself to the footage of the bay of pigs fiasco, a tour of Hemmingways home, complete with narration and original footage of Hemmingway hunting and later decorating his retreat home with his worldly prizes from his adventures. Feeling a little stuffed by now? Don't forget that included is a young Fidel the orator, making his anti- Yankee(not beisbol) speeches and for dessert President Kenedy speaking on the Cuban missle crisis. Exhausted or full yet? Well you will be after seeing this stream of consciousness movie. The characters are incidental vehicles of expression for this black and white picture of post revolutionary Cuba. This is what the world was allowed to see as represenative of Cuban film. Some will like it, others not. I imagine if you're living in Miami now you'll hate it. A stimulating movie that raises many questions, that depending on your viewpoint, creates many different answers. A must see for those interested in US-Cuban relations, or best said, those interested in knowing why we don't have relations. Every young, aspiring film maker should probably see this movie to learn something about film making.",982195200,13,2733,4.850107066381156
1184582,5,B000005F9Z,"This isn't just a film of historical value; far from it. It is one of the greatest films ever made by anyone. The balance of elements that went into this venture came out magnificently poetic and real. The semi-documentary style is deeply influenced by ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" and other New Wave classics, but the sensibility is Alea's own and distinctly 'Latin American Intellectual.'
There are very few films that can make me cry, this is one of them. The hot tears begin their descent, not because of the story itself, but the simple and beautifully subtle way it is expressed.
The leading character's central tragedy of not being able to reconcile his own deep feeling for his people with his intellectual standards because of their 'underdevelopment' and subsequent alienated existence, or more precisely, their inability to transcend their alienation to reach a more fulfilled state,  is one of the most touching and relevant themes I've ever seen in a film.
A great performance by Sergio Corrieri(I Am Cuba) provides the required erotic undertone and comedic rhythms to convey the true feel of an intellectual 'playboy' existence in early '60s Cuba. The effect of this film is visceral and must be seen to be appreciated, words can hardly describe it. Suffice it to suffice that it uses all the resources of cinema and then some. Not the least of the resources on parade is the fantastic, understated score by Leo Beower which perfectly captures the film's bittersweet mood.

1184583,5,B000005F9Z,"Instead it was not the first film of Tomas Gutierrez Alea, (Titon for his friends), there is no doubt that, Memories of the Underdevelopment is the most paradigmatic film not only in his biofilmography, also in the Cuban  film history. Sergio's stream of consciousness was never before used in the  latinoamerican cinema.

1184584,4,B000005F9Z,"A brilliant look at Cuba during the beginning of the Castro regime.

The film uses lots of brave, experimental and sophisticated visual techniques (sudden cuts to still photos, super long lens shots, handheld shots, intercutting news footage with staged), and almost all of it works towards making a fascinating whole. My only problem is that -- for me -- the experience is almost totally an intellectual one. I had very little emotional response during most of the film, although the last section, with the Cuban Missile Crisis looming has some real power.

7903353,3,B000005F9Z,"""if Ernest Hemingway had been born in Turkey he would have remained unknown""

It is true that Tomas Gutierrez Alea was one of the most well known Cuban film makers to come out of the Cuban Revolution. though Alea had been making films prior to the Revolution, he did respond to the needs and requirements of a post-colonial Cuban society. This meant creating films that addressed the concerns of the Government and the community at large. His films The Last Supper (1974) and History of the Revolution (1963) still remain somewhat unknown in this country but have circulated though under most mainstream radars.

This brings us to Memories of Underdevelopment (1968) which is considered to be a triumph in an experimental cut and paste critique on the ""Cuban Revolution itself. While this has been the known story for the past 45 years. Memories of Underdevelopment actually evolved from experimental Cuban film maker Nicolas Guillen Landrian whose short films ""En un Barrio Biejo (1963)"" and ""Los del Baile (1965)"" were the key ingredients to what Tomas Gutierrez Alea would eventually appropriate and include in his own film. Nicolas Guillen Landrian's own film making process and unique cut and paste approach would be lost under the success of Alea's films but one can see the consistency of Landrian's own magic through out his short career (1963-1972). Tomas Gutierrez Alea never repeated the quick cut and paste symbology he appropriated from Landrian's films again. I suggest film buffs and researchers seek out Nicolas Guillen Landrian's echo, it still thunders through out!

7903354,5,B000005F9Z,"The amazing thing about this film is that, 40 years later, it is still fresh.  Gutierrez Alea understood that Cuba was ready for changes, that those changes would critically impact all classes in Cuban society, some negatively, some positively.  He passed no judgement.  Through his main character, he allowed us to simply observe the transformations taking place.

The acting is superb, as well as the cinematography.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves quality film making.",1240963200,3,481,5.194805194805195
