8621950,3,B00GBFPTSG,"Priester's video certainly fills a need in the drum video market.  There's a plethora of videos on grooves and double bass techniques but too few videos covering drum fills.  However, his video is catered to the intermediate and advanced player, and it lacks any music to the demonstrations--frustrating unless you are a straight-up visual learner.  Hopefully this issue will be fixed soon.  Just for the fact, also, that there few videos covering drum fills, it still might be worth a purchase if you can find it on the cheap.",1390262400,,527,4.887640449438202
