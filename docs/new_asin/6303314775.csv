8324563,3,6303314775,"The video is wonderful; however, the VHS tapes are awful.  This is the 3-4th VHS tape we've had to buy.  The VHS tapes that the distributers send out from the factory are mucho CHEAP!  They only last about 1 year with continual playing.  Earth Dance needs to be made in DVD or blueray instead. We use the tape for relaxation just before we go to bed and we only play the tape for one week (at night) about every 3-4 weeks to cut down on the wear and tear on this cheap VHS tape.",1428192000,2,478,4.053191489361702
8324564,5,6303314775,"I had this movie for years before I really sat down to watch it. Now it is a family favorite. Especially if we are up at night and need something soothing to help us have good dreams. The images are simply breathtaking and fit so well with the music. It lets your mind drift and wander in the wilderness. With so much that whips your kids into a fenzy, this will help all in the family unwind and be inspired by the beauty of what is around them.",1049932800,2,446,4.079545454545454
8324565,5,6303314775,"I agree with all of the awards given to this beautiful ""piece of art""... the filming is breathtaking and the music is very tranquil and serene too.  It's a shame it is no longer available, but perhaps it will be re-released.  If you get a chance to buy a used copy, do it!  You won't be sorry!",973987200,3,293,4.105263157894737
