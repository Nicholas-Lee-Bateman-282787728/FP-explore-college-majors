The applications on this DVD were are based upon 12 striking angles derived at least in cooperation from those of Angel Cabales' Serrada Eskrima, which of course is a bladed art. Mike Inay was a student of these two masters... Basically this DVD shows three separate counters for each of those 12 angles to immobilize your attacker (at least) or cripple him (at worst) then a knife disarming technique and a takedown for EACH of those counters...thats a LOT of information, and it was all designed with practicality in mind Ive had mine for a year and Im still working through the information...give it a try.",1267660800,,783,4.764705882352941
