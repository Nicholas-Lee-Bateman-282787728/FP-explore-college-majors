1338992,2,B00004CRBM,"England, 1943. Bomb defuser David Farrar has one ""tin foot."" He rubs his ankle with a grimace and limps slightly, is moody and defeatist and booze thirsty, and so rather holds back in his relationship with Kathleen Byron. (There is no prolog showing the explosion that maimed him.) Now German planes are dropping ""thermos flask"" objects here and there which, when picked up, explode violently, taking a toll on children. (There is no scene of such an explosion; a scene with a killed boy's mother and his witnessing very young brother was deleted due to time considerations.) Farrar and his Army associate then rush to a location where a soldier is dying from his encounter with another explosive device, to ask him whether he picked it up by the end or the middle. (No need to show this explosion, just attend to the dying youth trying to speak.) Some time later the Army associate finds two more of these mysterious objects on a pebbly beach and phones Farrar to come quickly. The Army associate perishes trying to defuse device #1. (This explosion is not shown, but reported on when Farrar arrives at the site.) Farrar gets a grip on himself and goes alone to device #2 to do or die. There is no music to wring some suspense out of the scene, just walky-talky remarks between Farrar and other team members. Dear DVD Viewer, having watched the first hundred minutes of this semi-bore, are you secretly rooting for the explosive thermos flask?",1234310400,3,1444,4.734126984126984
1338993,5,B00004CRBM,"It was a surprise for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger to follow up the Technicolor extravaganzas of ""Black Narcissus"" and ""The Red Shoes"" with a throwback to their earlier work--the black-and-white, tightly focused World War II drama ""The Small Back Room."" Perhaps the film served as sort of a palate cleanser before they moved on to ""The Tales of Hoffmann,"" a film so rococo that it made ""The Red Shoes"" look modest. However, ""The Small Back Room"" is still a riveting, superbly made, character-driven thriller that is worth anyone's time.

Set in the early spring of 1943, the film tells the story of Sammy Rice, a bomb expert sinking into drink and despair after a failed effort to defuse a bomb caused one of his feet to be blown off, leaving him in constant agony. In his depression, Sammy is allowing the political players in his government department (led by a smarmy Jack Hawkins) to walk all over him, to the sorrow and anger of Susan, Sammy's secretary and live-in girlfriend.  Whether Sammy can sufficiently regain his confidence to save his job and his relationship with Susan is the crux of the story, which ends with a palm-sweatingly suspenseful sequence involving a German UXB on an English beach.

Powell and Pressburger brought virtually the entire crew from ""The Red Shoes"" over to ""The Small Back Room,"" including production designer Hein Heckroth and composer Brian Easdale, and their artistry pays off. So does the artistry of Christopher Challis--a camera operator on ""The Red Shoes,"" promoted to director of photography here--who provides B&W photography of uncommon clarity, depth and beauty. Above all, ""The Small Back Room"" is a wonderful showcase for the talents of David Farrar and Kathleen Byron, who were brilliant in ""Black Narcissus"" and equally fine here. Farrar's moody, bitter Sammy isn't all that different from ""Black Narcissus's"" Mr. Dean, but Byron's sane, kind-hearted Susan is a 180-degree turn from the crazed Sister Ruth of ""Black Narcissus."" The brilliance and variety that Byron demonstrated in these two roles makes it all the more tragic that she never achieved true stardom, as she deserved to do. But at least audiences will always have her performances in ""Black Narcissus"" and ""The Small Back Room"" as testimony to her radiant screen presence.",1220227200,37,2300,5.063324538258575
1338994,5,B00004CRBM,"Far from being an indicator of the decline of the creative genius of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, The Small Back Room harkens back to the pair's earlier black-and-white period and is an offbeat gem.  David Farrar shines as Sammy Rice, a bitter yet sensitive man unsure if he has enough character to accept the things he must and the strength to change what he can in his life.  Kathleen Byron (who appeared with Farrar in P&P's Black Narcissus in 1947) plays Susan, a shrewd, strong woman nevertheless deeply in love with a flawed, perhaps failure of a man.  Their relationship, suprisingly and refreshingly adult in a period still wrapped in censorship restrictions, is the core of the film as Sammy battles his inner demons and those at his government job as one of the nameless, faceless experts in the ""small back room.""  Full of wonderful character support (Jack Hawkins, Cyril Cusack and a hilarious cameo by Robert Moreley as a vapid government minister) and the famed Powell and Pressburger puckish humor and bursts of fantasy, this is a treat on all fronts.  Beware the American released shorter version  (UK release is 103 minutes).",1184457600,18,1152,4.912371134020619
7919819,5,B00004CRBM,"Michael Powell, fiercely loyal to his small and characterful acting company, was happily fond of rotating his special favorites--notably Anton Walbrook, Roger Livesey, Eric Portman, David Farrar, Kathleen Byron, Ludmilla Tch&eacute;rina, Moira Shearer and Deborah Kerr--through intensely personal and uniquely individual projects that incidentally also roped in Wendy Hiller, Googie Withers, Sheila Sym, Jean Simmons and Jennifer Jones to interact with his core stock company. SMALL BACK ROOM, released in 1949 but convincingly set in the grimmest days of '43 when winning the war was iffy, is an especially intimate and affecting solo showcase for the enchantingly sensual Byron and the suave and virile Farrar. Given its production date, the film has benign, nonviolent, noirish tendencies with exceptional monochrome cinematography by Christopher Challis. The production design and cinematography emphasize the makeshift qualities of Farrar's wartime research laboratories and the cozy but lonely warmth of his nearby flat where Byron frequently stays on quite frankly and openly.

As a research academic Farrar's Sammy Rice knows advanced German bombs, innocuously miniaturized as domestic torches or thermos flasks, with intellectual precision (cf. the Bletchley Park codebreakers). Physically Sammy is hobbled with a ""tin foot"" annulling his career as a footballer, and there are ongoing temptations from the bottle, but wartime providentially consolidates the character's innate professionalism, and Farrar does demanding and strenuous physical work, with a growing smile, in the final bomb-neutralization reels. Farrar's character speaks and acts for the proactive British patriot the artist Michael Powell may have wanted to be, and the film is a fine, slightly darker, postwar companion piece to 49TH PARALLEL, ONE OF OUR AIRCRAFT IS MISSING and the astonishing CANTERBURY TALE. Jingoism, Mrs. Minivers and Blitz ballads by Vera Lynn are intentionally avoided here, although there's an interesting nightclub appearance by the jazz subgroup of Ted Heath's larger danceband.

As the Canterbury film confirmed, Powell was a thorough romantic, and in SMALL BACK ROOM there are four great visual setpieces: a haunting gunnery test set at Stonehenge; a ticking clock/ringing telephone nightmare in Farrar's London flat; a destructive alcoholic meltdown in the flat; and finally the bravura bomb deconstruction beautifully filmed at Chesil Bank (Farrar's brawny character had surfed these sands as recently as 1933, we're told, and Farrar sinks into them and redemptive sunshine with orgiastic abandon once the nasty bomb is suspensefully disabled). Farrar/Sammy Rice, having one very good day, bonds in passing with Anthony Bushell and returns to London for a completely rehabilitated relationship with Byron.

The Bushell scene is suggestive and touching, and Farrar also interacts with the great Leslie Banks, Michael Hough, Cyril Cusack and Ren&eacute;e Asherson. Jack Hawkins and Robert Morley pop up, none too idiomatically by Archers standards, in smaller roles. Farrar, Byron and Powell working in tandem give this film unusual warmth, depth and humanity, and there are layers of meaning and inference here that make the film well worth revisiting. Farrar's conflicted-man performance--if you know and admire GONE TO EARTH and BLACK NARCISSUS--alone is really stupendous, one of the finest star turns in the radiant Powell-Pressburger galaxy.",1472428800,,3453,5.779960707269155
7919820,5,B00004CRBM,"One of the deepest human dramas ever written and translated into a flawless film.  A movie that is rediscovered on every viewing.  David Farrar gives a stunning performance of a man of highest dedication to his values, and in consequence of leaves him in chronic physical and mental pain.  Some interpret this as a film about an alcoholic.  To me, the alcohol is not the story at all, it's just an effect of living with intolerable pain.  The real story is about a man who must decide to commit to life as it is or not.",1472342400,,519,4.364583333333333
7919821,5,B00004CRBM,"This is another Powell-Pressburger film I never tire of watching. Although done in 1949, the story is set around 1942-43, when England was on the losing side of the war. Its main character, Sammy Price, an alcoholic with a wooden leg, and an expert in weapons technology and in defusing bombs, deals with his own dragons. Susan, his girlfriend, helps him defuse his own internal ""bombs"" while at the same time dealing with the internal corrupt politics of weapon manufacturing and politics as usual. While showing Sammy's own internal conflicts, the film also shows the politics behind weapon manufacturing that is still relevant today. Although I love the entire film, the last thirty minutes are definitely the most suspenseful of all. I consider this movie as great as any other PP movies done during this decade. This Criterion edition also has some background commentary which is useful to movie lovers.",1463097600,4,908,5.06
7919822,5,B00004CRBM,"So many great actors here:  Handsome David Farrar (I know him best from ""Black Narcissus""), Kathleen Byron, Jack Hawkins, Michael Gough, Renee Asherson.  Intense plot involving bureaucracy, alcoholism, and UXBs, inventively filmed (the giant whiskey bottle scene is surreal, a bit over the top, but sort of genius) on rather amazing British locations (Stonehenge - you want to yell at the actors, ""Get your boots off that!"" -- also Chesil Beach).",1382918400,,446,5.267605633802817
7919823,4,B00004CRBM,"Sure lots of people on both sides of the Atlantic admired the pluck of the under-armed, under-manned, under- led British in holding up Hitler's plans for a while to conquer all of Europe and who knows where else. And everybody knows, who has thought about it for a while, that running a modern war machine requires more than having X number of battalions fully armed and mobile ready to fight on some god-forsaken front. Those two ideas combine (oh, yah, along with a little off-hand romantic interest this is after all a cinematic effort) to drive this film under review, The Small Back Room.

Sammy (played in a manic-depressive manner as befits the character by David Farrah) is an explosives expert who, having done his bit at the front and taken a hit, a painfully bothersome artificial leg resulting, is now working his magic in the back rooms of the war establishment figuring out what will work and will not work in terms of military hardware. Of course all of this is tangled up with his pain, his attempts to deal with it through drugs and alcohol, his affair with his resolute stiff-upper lip girlfriend, Susan, (played by Kathleen Byron), who is forced to leave him as he attempts to hit bottom, military bureaucratic snafus, and other impediments to the war effort in order to turn the tide against the Germans.

Oh yah, and to keep a little dramatic tension a little off-hand problem with booby-trapped bombs that the Germans keep dropping over the English countryside. Naturally Sammy, in his element then, has to have a go at defanging these dastardly instruments, does so successfully and receives a big boost to his self-esteem (and a small back room of his own).  Oh yah, as well, Susan comes back to him. Hell, you knew that was coming I told you she was resolute.",1355961600,,1784,4.711538461538462
7919824,5,B00004CRBM,"About 20 years ago I taped this movie from TV (mea culpa) and quite liked it.  Recently I paid hard cash for the Criterion version and was very pleasantly surprised.  The sound and vision quality were excellent.  Several new scenes (cut from the TV version) really helped to flesh out the movie; the reminiscences of cameraman Christopher Challis (taped in 2008) and director Michael Powell were an extra bonus.

The restored scenes were mainly on the inter-departmental turf wars that stood in the way of the scientific war effort.  Protagonists included the end-users of the scientific weaponry (the military), the academic scientists who thought they were still at university, and the paper-pushing civil servants...not to forget the politicians who liked grandstanding.

Anyone who looks closely into the modern push for ""renewable energy"" will recognise this sort of pattern, with the place of the military being taken by the consumers in their struggle to maintain a decent standard of living.

Of course the main theme of the movie is the overcoming of a personal adversity -- somehow it has the same flavour as ""The King's Speech"" although not so grand.",1326153600,,1161,5.111111111111111

7919826,2,B00004CRBM,"I had seen this movie years and years ago and was excited to see it available on DVD. However, as in so many memories, this movie did not live up to expectations on re-watching.

The plot drags terribly for most of the movie, with the David Farrar character feeling oh-so sorry for himself and his girlfriend inexplicably standing by him. Even in a peacetime movie this would be tiresome, but to have someone sitting more or less safely in London whining about his foot pain while so many fellow Brits were dying by the thousands is pretty annoying.

The climactic bomb disposal scene is great, but it just hints at how good this movie *could* have been.

The DVD extras are superb, with interviews with a cameraman and snippets from a biography that talk a lot about Powell & Pressburger and their other films.",1310083200,7,811,4.618055555555555
7919827,5,B00004CRBM,"This is the story of a WWII British ""boffin"" or military scientist, who also, when necessary, defuses new types of German explosive ordnance.  It's far truer to how men actually face dangerous work and the measurable possibility of death that ""The Hurt Locker.""  It also contains the best male bonding sequence I've ever seen.",1309651200,5,326,5.018518518518518
