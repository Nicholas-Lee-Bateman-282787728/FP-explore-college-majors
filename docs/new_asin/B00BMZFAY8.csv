8571227,4,B00BMZFAY8,"Funny, honest, irreverent statement of the current dating scene & womens lack of sympathy for lesser men. It's definately not for your younger children but any adult with a healthy sense of humor ( man or woman ) will love this stand up concert. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was becuase they space out the routine with back ground interviews of the cast & their memories of making it. While some may find this interesting I'm all about the funny. Fortunately that's was the fast forward button is for :-)",1378512000,,522,4.447916666666667
