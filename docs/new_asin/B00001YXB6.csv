7915054,5,B00001YXB6,"This is the first episode of the classic Wagon Train series. This is a must for all Ernest Major Adams is keen to get the Wagon Train under way, but one of the wagons is missing a driver. Adams is arguing with the owner to pull his wagon out of line when Willy Moran is thrown out of the nearby saloon and lands practically at Adams feet. Moran is known to Adams from his army days. Then, Moran was a boxer. Now he is an alchohlic. Robinson, the owner of the wagon, sees Moran as his passport to staying on the train. Against his better judgement, Adams agrees to let Moran drive for Robinson. It is an opportunity for Moran to redeem himself, especially when a young widow takes a shine to him. For Robinson's purposes, though, Moran is more use as a drunkard. Borgnine fans. He is a Great Character Actor. Ward Bond is superb!",1227830400,,828,4.314102564102564

The story of ANYONE ELSE is coming. The problem with Willy Moran is Willy Moran itself. You know,man. But the Chief knows best. Poor Moran. I ever prefer the long,long, run in Wagon Train,specially since i've got my own hit and run and cover myself in the middle of nowhere in the road to San Francisco. Just like Willy Moran.",989712000,,598,4.704761904761905
