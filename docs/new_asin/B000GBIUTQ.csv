8130486,5,B000GBIUTQ,"Great video.  After about 10 years of mountain biking with several different instructors I learned a lot from watching the West Coast Style videos.  Good instruction, easy to understand, good shots of the riders, well-made videos.  Just what I needed to improve my riding and stay safe.  Thanks!",1329782400,,295,5.083333333333333

8130488,3,B000GBIUTQ,"It was alright, however, I was disappointed. Expected better explanation on such topics as: loading and unloading, getting into the attack position, braking, corners, getting over obstacles etc. The location is beautiful, but the presentation and tips need work and too general.  If one wants good tips I recommend the following book: Mastering Mountain Bike Skills (I hope they make a video).",1306281600,,393,5.338709677419355
8130489,5,B000GBIUTQ,"This instructional DVD is great for beginner or intermediate levels (and even advanced), the detailed explanations and video clips of every skill are an useful tool to those who want to be better riders. Joan Jones did an excellent job in this video and it is clear that she is an experimented instructor, Elladee Brown her workmate during the video is not just another skillful teacher but a very pretty woman. Fortunately for mountain biking sport there are people as Joan and Elladee around.",1193097600,,494,4.892857142857143
