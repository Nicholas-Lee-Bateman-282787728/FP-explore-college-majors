8070935,5,B000A0C6YS,"Brilliant DVD that counts down the top 50 goalscorers for Liverpool.  Hosted by one of them, John Aldridge, the goalscorers range from psycho Ian St. John, to Jimmy Case, Steve Highway, Peter Beardsley, to the obvious trio of Keegan, Dalglish, and Rush.  Get it...you won't be disappointed.",1151193600,3,290,5.148936170212766
