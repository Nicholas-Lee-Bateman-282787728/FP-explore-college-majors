4389995,3,B004J2FJ24,"What do you call something that pretends to be something it isn't? This movie pretends to be another ""Casablanca."" It has the look, it has the feel, but it turns out to be a cheap imitation - actually just another B movie that makes otherwise good actors act as though they were nothing much more than amateurs, because the writing  - & sometimes the direction - is so amateurish.  A waste of time, actually.",1350000000,2,408,4.5
4389996,5,B004J2FJ24,"I first saw this film in the '90's on AMC, when it aired only classic films. It's a Paramount Studio film which fell into the public domain and was never released on VHS or DVD. With a cast including Burt Lancaster, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Peter Lorre and Corinne Calvert, it's got to be good. A great action film set in South Africa. This story revolves around the diamond industry. So good, it was worth the 15 year wait.",1315526400,11,427,4.417721518987341
4389997,4,B004J2FJ24,"I first saw this in 48, and it turned out to be Lancaster's last film noir.  At the time the critics said it was far too violent, they didn't forsee the fure of movies. Apparently producer Hal Wallis wanted to recapture his success of CASABLANCA, even useing tow of it's stars, Paul Hendried, Peter Lorre and Claude Rains but this is far removed from that movie, less romantic and certainly more violent.  Rains as usual gives an impeccable performance, Hendried makes a great villan, and Lorre is suitably sinister. But dispite this Lancaster dominates all his scenes.  The fight scene is particularly good.  A very good tough movie that still holds up today. After this Lancaster would try and change his film noir image completly with his next three movies, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW, MISTER 880 and VENGEANCE VALLEY, but I always remember those old film noirs with more than nostalgia",1310169600,43,886,4.809210526315789

4390001,5,B004J2FJ24,"Genre: Adventure Noir
Stars: 4.5

Pros:
-Gritty (I know it is a bad pun, but I never thought Film Noir in the desert would work)
-Great casting (when you can make the plot unbelievable and pull it off, part has to be the cast)
-Ambiguity of the characters (really I am not sure if I am supposed to cheer for the main character or just hate him less than the villain)
-Script
-Cinematography

Cons:
-The female character is a little weak (though I think the actress does well with the part)
-South Africa is a little cringe-worthy (no matter what time you set the film in)

I recommend this movie.  The depth of some of the characters is surprising.  On top of that the movie works so well it is almost an epic (ok, maybe that is a little exaggeration).  It has been a while since I have enjoyed watching a movie the whole time through it.  In the end the weaknesses are almost non-issues. Watch it especially if you like any of the actors or the Genre.",1463011200,,952,4.314606741573034

4390022,4,B004J2FJ24,"""Rope of Sand"" is a gritty crime film set in an exotic locale, produced by Hal B. Wallis in 1949, seven years after he had a hit with the similarly exotic ""Casablanca"". A stentorian voice explains that the desert ""surrounds like a rope of sand the richest diamond-bearing area in the world"", ""where men inflamed by monotony and heat sometimes forget the rules of civilization,"" as we gaze at the seemingly endless sand dunes of the desert in colonial South West Africa, near the Angolan border. A man flees two armored police vehicles across the dunes, trying to escape with diamonds belonging to the Colonial Diamond Company, which obsessively and violently guards the perimeter of its claim.  American Mike Davis (Burt Lancaster) arrives in port after a two-year absence. Chief of police Paul Vogel (Paul Henreid) isn't pleased to see him. Davis was a desert hunting guide whom Vogel and Mr. Martingale (Claude Rains), president of the Colonial Diamond Company, suspect knows the location of a valuable new diamond deposit, and whom they tortured to try to get  that information.

Hal B. Wallis tries to capitalize on a proven formula in ""Rope of Sand"": exotic location, colorful characters with foreign accents, a wronged man, a loose women with a heart of gold -at least where the wronged man is concerned, sex, violence, diamonds, and a great cast. It sounds good, and the film in enjoyable, but it is palpably trying too hard to capitalize on these elements, to the point of contrivance and clich. Peter Lorre is underutilized in the superfluous role of a slimy and savvy barroom raconteur. French actress Corinne Calvet plays Mike Davis' love interest, pouty blackmailing trollop Suzanne Renaud, whom Martingale hires to ply information from Davis. This is Calvet's first feature-length English-language film. She is good enough but not star material. Claude Rains plays his typical worldly gentleman. Paul Henreid gives the standout performance as the sadistic, social-climbing police chief Vogel, very much the opposite of his ""Casablanca"" role. I found the resolution unsatisfying, but the film is entertaining enough for fans of 1940s crime thrillers.

The DVD (Olive Films 2011): True to Olive Films tradition, this disc has no bonus features. There is a scene menu. The print does not appear to be restored, but it is a good print with good sound.",1426204800,2,2360,5.059125964010283

4390027,4,B004J2FJ24,"Allowing for primitive, or low-budget, sets, the film has a certain interesting drive.  There are characters complex enough to change sides, and there's a chance to see early Burt Lancaster in confrontation with mid-career Paul Henreid.

4390030,5,B004J2FJ24,Here is a neat little nugget! I had never heard of this flick. Cast is great. Lancaster is on his game. Paul Henreid as the villain? Excellent. Absolutely the opposite of his character in Casablanca. The ever charming Claus Rains as the good bad guy you hate to love. Peter Lorre does not get as much screen time or as big a part as one would like but he still adds to the picture. The Easter egg in all of this is Corine Calvet as the conflicted ingenue. It is B&W. Sound and film quality are very good. Kudos to ever found this gem.,1409270400,3,534,4.144230769230769

4390034,5,B004J2FJ24,"Lancaster said of all his films, this one he did ""for the money"" displeased him the most.  And a lot of folks think Corinne Calvert doesn't have the look of a leading lady, and think her accent muddies her dialogue.  Well, she's all there for real on the screen, not a product of plastic surgery, and provides a subtle and amazing arc from bad girl to good with credibility and sexiness 1949 style--

...and Lancaster sells himself short, as this film noir has all the plot twists and dark moments you could ask for in a black and white thriller of the '40's.  He never mails in a line and neither does anyone else, what more could you ask for besides free microwave popcorn?

The film predates ""Blood Diamond"" by half century, but I can't remember anything else dealing with that ""industry"" in interim.
And there isn't a flawed performance in the steller group, which is only missing Sidney Greenstreet to round out a familiar troop of actors in this genre.

Far more worth sitting through than some of the dreck put out these days.  I liked it.",1400284800,14,1046,4.531914893617022

Oh, and there is also beautiful girl that everyone wants. {Corinne Calvet is delightful to watch but difficult to listen to with her high-pitched, accent-heavy voice.)
