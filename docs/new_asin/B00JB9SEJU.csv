8649557,1,B00JB9SEJU,This is a movie which is close to pure rubbish and garbage !! A talented cast (Kirron Kher and Anupam Kher) have been wasted and a great story has been mucked up terribly. It is a waste of time to watch this. The only thing worth listening to are Kirron Kher's Punjabi mother lines which any Punjabi will identify with. Anupam Kher's character is wasted and spends all of his screen time walking around like a zombie. Ali Zafar spends the whole movie with the same stupid expression-which gets irritating by the end. And interestingly all these people living in UK do not have British Indian accents !!! Please do not waste your money or your time. This is another of those garbage pictures coming out of Bollywood-which is awash in money and can waste it on any bulls*** picture. Thank You.,1408147200,,791,4.577464788732394
