1260864,5,B00003BDXO,It doesn't make any sense that this show was canceled. But for those who are looking for re-runs the series is shown on CourtTV at 9:00pm.,953596800,,138,4.346153846153846
1260865,5,B00003BDXO,"I find it hard to believe that NBC cancelled this for ""Cold Feet"", a show geared to a homogenized part of the country when they should have given this show the props it deserved.  The best of the three  is still the pilot.  Where it establishes the complexities of each of the  characters and their unorthodox methods dealing with the criminal  underworld.",951350400,4,356,4.67741935483871
1260866,5,B00003BDXO,"Andre Braugher is at his finest in this episode, one of the series' most heart-wrenching. Guest star D'Onofrio is convincing as the victim. The show picks up on several familiar themes of HOMICIDE: the randomness of crimes,  the disinterest of perpetrators, and the futility of seeking an  explanation.
Equally compelling, though, is the companion documentary  that reveals how difficult it was for the production team to get the  episode made and aired. You really get a feel for the passion of the show's  creators, and you find yourself rooting for them as they go up against the  NBC brass.
The documentary is a great introduction to the ins-and-outs of  network TV. I showed it (and the episode) to my students in a high school  film class to give them an idea about what goes into making a television  show. They were as entranced by the behind-the-scenes footage as they were  by the actual episode.
This tape is a great intro to those who have never  seen the show, but also a must-have for dedicated H:LOTS fans.",951004800,16,1021,4.744318181818182
1260867,5,B00003BDXO,"One of Homicide's best episodes, ""The Accident"" or ""Subway Show,"" premiered during its creative low point.  Like a lot of Homicide fans, I wasn't happy with the direction the series took in its final two seasons.  I won't rehash the typical complaints other than to say that, even during that time, the show was still one of the greatest in television history whenever it forgot about its new ""supercops"" and focused on the fiery, iconic Detective Frank Pembleton.  Pembleton was a rarity -- a believable human being who seemed, at times, to speak with the voice of God.  He gave the show's grim proceedings a much needed moral compass.  One knew that as long as Pembleton was walking the streets, then the darkness erupting all around wouldn't be allowed to envelop the world.
In ""The Subway,"" Pembleton literally becomes, if not God, then perhaps the equivalent of St. Peter.  When a commuter (brilliantly played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is pushed in front of a moving train, the unfortunate man finds himself literally hanging between life and death.  Suspended between the train and the platform, he is questioned by Pembleton concerning who might have pushed him.  But if this sounds like a gimmick, then be aware that this show deals with so much more.  During their conversation, D'Onofrio and Pembleton confront the issues of life, death, fate, and faith that fueled the show since its premiere -- issues that many fans correctly felt the show had mistakenly moved away from during the final two seasons.  Pembleton becomes almost a father confessor for D'Onofrio.  Perhaps most arrestingly (for me at least), is that D'Onofrio's victim isn't presented in an extremely sympathetic light.  While other shows would have idealized him, Homicide makes it victim out to be a self-centered, vain jerk.  He is a man forced to confront the whole of his still young life in one hour and for him, that subway platform becomes his purgatory.  Not what you'd typically expect to see on television and one of the main reasons why I've always thought of this show as Homicide's proper swan song.
As for the documentary included with the video, its a fun watch and definitely will be enjoyable to any true Homicide fan.  However, even if the tape was composed only of this episode, it would be a must have for anyone serious about how television can truly create a work of art.",1000857600,22,2367,4.853233830845771
1260868,5,B00003BDXO,"Homicide was and is the best show ever aired on US television.  Even with the more pedestrian seventh season, Homicide was a cut above the rest.  The show was criminally ignored, barely escaped cancelation several times and was given a bad time slot, but still it survived on the quality of acting and writing in it.  What other show has had guest stars such as Robin Williams, Steve Buschemi, Lily Tomlin and James Earl Jones?
This box set puts together three of the best episodes of a wonderful series.  Gone For Goode introduces us to the detectives, Every Mother's Son is heartbreaking and wonderfully acted with some of the most moving scenes done by extras and A Doll's Eyes, another sad yet brilliant episode.
Catch it on CourtTV, it is worth watching.",994809600,2,759,4.7272727272727275
1260869,5,B00003BDXO,"I became hooked to Homicide: Life on the Streets and the first episode I saw was ""Homicide.com"" in one of my classes.  I was upset when it was cancelled from NBC because it is such a riveting and powerful show.  I'm glad that Court TV picked the show up and I watch it every night.  I agree that we should have access to the entire collection.  ""Homicide.com"" is my personal favorite and would love to see it put on VHS so I can purchase it.  I love all of the characthers on the show; they portray the harsh reality of homicide detectives.  I sure hope that more episodes get released on VHS so they can be available to us diehard Homicide fans.  Thanks!",992390400,2,655,4.276422764227642
1260870,5,B00003BDXO,"There is no doubt that Homicide was an incredible show during the entire run of the series with the exception of season 6 and 7. However, the best episode of the series by far was The Subway.
The Subway follows the story of the attempted/successful murder of a man going off to his office for another day when he is pushed into the oncoming path of a subway train getting caught inbetween two cars. Det(s). Pembleton and Bayliss(Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor)race to the scene to find out all they can about the situation before their witness/victim dies on them.
This episode was the most riveting and suspense filled episode I have ever seen during this show's run. It had you in it's grip and wouldn't let go until the screen faded to black and the credits came up. The performance by victim Vincent D'nofrio was incredible and unforgettable.",986169600,11,845,4.677852348993288
1260871,5,B00003BDXO,"This show was a hit from the very beginning. In the pilot episode Rookie Detc. Time Bayliss(Kyle Secor)walks into the Homicide Unit looking confused and lost. No sooner has he been there but one day and partnered up with the stubborn Frank Pembleton who has no need for a naive partner, he gets bombarded with his first case. The rape and murder of 12 year old Adena Watson. This case will haunt the troubled Detective throughout the series of the show.
This episode also introduces the other characters of the show and explores the troubles of each and everyone of them. In all honesty, after seeing this episode you will be hooked and learn that even though it is no longer aired: this show will never die.",986169600,2,708,4.582677165354331
1260872,5,B00003BDXO,"If you're reading this, chances are you're already a fan of Homicide to some degree. Some early fans of the show became disenchanted with the program as its run on NBC progressed, feeling that it became more conventional. While it's true that the show's later seasons used less of the stirring camera-work which was the show's visual trademark in the early episode, the stories told were no less compelling.
A case in point is season six's ""The Accident"" or as it's commonly known ""the subway episode."" When a commuter becomes pinned between a subway train and the platform, detectives Tim Bayliss and Frank Pembleton are called in, because the accident victim is alsmost certainly going to die. As Bayliss tries to determine what caused the accident, Pembleton (as played by Emmy-winner Andre Braugher) forms an uneasy bond with the victim (played by Vincent D'Onofrio). With Homicide, the focus was always less on what the detectives revealed about their cases and more on what the detectives revealed about themselves as human beings.
Of all Homicide's detectives none showed us more of what was good and bad about human beings than Frank Pembleton. In the context of the show, Pembleton was not only the best investigator in the squad, he was also the moral center, a good man whose sense of right and wrong never fails, soemone who will always remain on the right side of that line even if it means offending those who care about him. As he tries to comfort the victim whom he knows is about to die, Pembleton confronts his own beliefs and notions of faith and goodness. The interplay between the two characters is as insightful, gripping and well-written as anything committed to film in years, and more than anything this is probably the episode which earned Andre Braugher his Emmy award.
This episode also went on to win the Peabody award and was the subject of a fascinating documentary called ""Anatomy of a Homicide."" In addition to focusing on the specifics of writing and producing ""the subway episode,"" it is also an intriguing window into the politics of television network programming. That documentary is available on this tape along with the full episode. Homicide never quite got its due during its network run, but the availability of these two productions may help redress that balance.",972345600,17,2307,4.917948717948718
1260873,5,B00003BDXO,"Simply put, Homicide: Life on the Street is the greatest show ever to air on TV.  Its a wonder why the show never was nominated for an Emmy, although  Andre Braugher did win the award for Best Lead Actor in 1998, as well as  other nominations, most notably, the episodes Three Men and Adena from the  first season, and The Subway from the sixth.  For diehard Homicide fans,  the show airs Monday-Thursdays at 8pm and 12am Eastern on CourtTV.  This  video set is definately reccomended.",966124800,4,485,4.623529411764705
1260874,5,B00003BDXO,"I don't watch many shows on television.  I find most network offerings to be nearly insulting in their simplicity and slavish adherence to formula, and when I hear any TV show praised to the skies, I assume that's just the  product of lowered expectations on the part of someone who's taken in too  much canned laughter and cliched drama.
For years I heard Homicide was  worth watching but I put it on the back burner.  I figured, at best, it  would be an NYPD Blue without all the embarrasingly soap-opera-esque  personal tragedies and stilted, robotic dialogue.  But now that I've seen  Homicide in reruns, my ideas of what a television series can be has  changed.  Homicide is everything that great drama is -- gripping, moving,  funny, terrifying, heatbreaking, thrilling, and profoundly and insightfully  human.  The depth of the characters and the storylines draw the viewer in  to a world as fully-fleshed and compelling as our own.  Great writing,  great acting, great camera work, great visual montages, great music (I will  never hear ""Beautiful Way,"" already a favorite song before I saw  the Homicide movie, without thinking of Gee . . .) -- I could pile on the  superlatives forever but you probably get the point.
Watch as much of  this series as you can.  Television doesn't get any better.",960681600,9,1305,4.863013698630137
1260875,5,B00003BDXO,"I watched Homicide: Life on the Street, for all the years it was on and this is by far one of the best episodes.  And all of them are terriffic, which says a lot.
Here is the story of a man caught halfway under a  subway, knowing this is the end of his road. Excellent and very notable  performances by everyone.
top notch.",958348800,3,323,4.095238095238095
1260876,5,B00003BDXO,"This episode alone is the best HOMICIDE I've ever seen.  Barring the undeniably brilliant perfomances by Vincent D'Onofrio and Andre Braugher, the story is captivating and the tensions sweet torture!  The difficulty of  knowing a man is going to die and the struggle to do his job as a cop and  so much more...  What an episode!  That aside, as I said, the documentary  is a real view of the politics of network television and the complete bliss  of getting what you want.  They had a great guest star, a script that  worked, and a producer/writer determined to get what he wanted!  Just  great, a MUST for HOMICIDE or D'Onofrio fans!",957916800,6,634,4.612612612612613

7916953,5,B00003BDXO,"""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" was always a favorite of the critics, but it never garnered the ratings success that it so fittingly deserved. Featuring one of the most gifted ensemble casts ever put together (especially the brilliant Andre Braugher with exemplary support from Yaphet Kotto, Kyle Secor and Clark Johnson), ""Homicide"" should still be on NBC's schedule, right there with the respective ""Law & Order's"" and ""ER"".
If one episode clearly exemplifies the intensity and the quality of the series' writing, as well as the skills of the actors, it is ""Subway"". Braugher gets to run the gamut of his emotions as he deals with the hopeless situation of guest star Vincent D'onofrio, also giving an award winning turn as the trapped commuter.
The episode is a nail-biter and a prime example of what television should be.",1056326400,11,825,4.9855072463768115
7916954,5,B00003BDXO,"Typically if I want to get a friend's reaction to my favorite drama ever, I'll have them sit down and watch these three episodes with me. They represent some of the finest acting and cinematography I've seen in quite some time.
1) The Pilot: ""Gone for Goode"" - It's Tim Bayliss' (Kyle Secor) first day on the Homicide Unit commanded by Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto) and the introduction to the cast of characters begins: John Munch (Richard Belzer), the cynical jaded but dedicated cop partnered with the ""close to retirement"" Stan Bolander (Ned Beatty), Meldrick Lewis (Clark Johnson) is partnered with Steve Crosetti (Jon Polito) and Kay Howard (Melissa Leo) is partnered with Beau Felton (Daniel Baldwin). The wildcard in the unit is Frank Pembleton, the unit's best detective who likes to work alone. Lewis and Crosetti investigate a shooting that might lead to solving 5 more murders (and making them look like heros), Munch is coerced into opening up an accidental death that Bolander thinks was a murder.  And Bayliss gets paired up with Pembleton during a murder of an older guy in a hotel and learns firsthand that what he's taught in the classroom doesn't hold up in the real world.
Some famous lines:
Bolander: ""She was murdered John, you have to speak for her""
--
Howard: ""Homicide? We work for God""
--
Munch: ""I've been murder police for ten years. If you're going to lie to me, you lie to me with respect.""
--
Crosetti: ""That's the problem with this job. It's got nothin' to do with life.""
2) ""Every Mother's Son"" - Bayliss and Pembleton investigate the murder of a 14 year old boy at a bowling alley to find out another 14 year old boy shot him. The shooter thinks he should go because he killed the wrong guy. The mother's killer and the mother of the victim unknowingly meet up and talk for a long period of time in the squad room. Pembleton gets disillusioned about ever having children if they grow up in a world like this.
3) ""A Doll's Eye"" - Bayliss and Pembleton get involved in a shooting of a boy at a mall. The boy ends up brain dead and the parents struggle with taking the boy off of life support and placing his organs in the organ donor registry to save other children's lives. Marcia Gay Hayden's portrayal of the little boy's mom will have you in tears. It's a quiet episode that focuses on the victims and the struggles that they have to face.",1056153600,5,2373,4.570422535211268
7916955,5,B00003BDXO,"Homicide: Life On The Street is hands down the best television series ever. It is the Lord of the Rings of TV. Feature-film levels of scripting, acting and directing. The stories are intense, sad, funny, and gripping. The characters shame any others on TV, and stand with the best of fictional characters in any medium. Get it, watch it, love it.",1044835200,,346,4.688524590163935
7916956,5,B00003BDXO,"Anyone that has ever seen this top quality crime drama would agree that there has never been anything else like HOMICIDE on television or the big screen!
This show, in reruns, is as powerful, moving, thought provoking, and at times humorous, as it was during its first run on NBC during the 90's.
EVERY...and I do mean EVERY character leaps off the page with realism and charisma, thanks in part to those who put pen to paper and wrote the lines, and also to the amazing actor who breathed life into the well written scripts.
The early shows are by far the best!  And that you will see on this video.  Pembelton and Balis, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor, were televisions definitive dynamic duo.  I believe that they, and the other cast members, set a standard for ensemble casts that will never be beat.  (A few of the cast members that joined the show towards the end of its run were not as powerful as the original actors, but that didn't stop the show from delivering quality episodes.)
Others have suggested NBC release all of the episodes on DVD and I agree!  This was truly MUST SEE TV and for what ever reason the network couldn't see it.  (This show is timeless and I would love to see it resurrected, perhaps on cable TV!  Are you listening HBO?)
HOMICIDE - Life On The Street is without a doubt is the best television show to date!  Kudos to all responsible for bridging it to life, to Court TV for airing it in reruns, and to Amazon.com for bring the series to its fan via VHS and DVD!",1026864000,6,1496,4.394927536231884
7916957,5,B00003BDXO,"I have never had such a visceral reaction to any piece of drama, live or on big screen or small.
I'd long been a Homicide fan, so I was well aware of Andre Braugher's skill, but Vincent D'Onofrio's performance was a revelation. His character is Everyschmuck, the Bud Lite-swilling blowhard found in any bar on any Saturday night, under-tipping the bartender and copping a feel from the cocktail waitress.
But as he slowly discovers his fate, he strips away his schmuckness in layers, like an onion, with Braugher's Pembleton as Father Confessor and keeper of the knowledge that he is doomed. Together they reveal the character's essential humanity and vulnerability.
Pembleton is our surrogate, I think, because he doesn't like this guy much either, but goes in to do his job, and is eventually touched by him, as we are.
My words are feeble. Just see it.",1024704000,17,855,4.8231292517006805
7916958,5,B00003BDXO,"I moved to Baltimore by about Homicide's 3rd season.  I had seen a few episodes and was annoyed by the jittery camera work.  After living in Baltimore for a few months, and after being forced to watch a few episodes, I was entranced by both the show and the city.  Homicide transcends the typical ""place-less"" show (TV or cinema--is Frasier really a Seattle show? I think not) because it weaves people, events, and emotions in a solid geography.  I believe people were--and are still--hooked on this show because it has so much personality and charisma.  Baltimore is a town with history, charm, quirks, character, meloncholy, cynicism, evil, joy, and warmth.  Homicide captured that and slowly spoon fed it to viewers episode by episode.  I don't think most viewers were aware of it, but it happened and it was addictive.  To me, the drama, joy, and pain of Homicide is the drama, joy, and pain of the City of Baltimore and its citizens.  Only one question remains: where are the Homicide DVDs??",1007856000,,996,4.777777777777778
