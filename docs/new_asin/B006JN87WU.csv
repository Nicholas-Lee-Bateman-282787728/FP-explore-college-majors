8499733,4,B006JN87WU,"I gave this program 4.0 stars because I thought it could have had more content on the battle that the Monitor and the Virginia fought, as well as on the Virginia too. That said it does cover the Monitor pretty well with a segment on the iron ships that preceded the Monitor like the HMS Warrior, the plans, designer and the pressing need for the ship. It covers the revolutionary features of  the Monitor  with re-enactments and computer generated images. Then it goes into the battle the two ironclads fought. The show switches back and forth between footage of the divers trying to raise and preserve as much of the Monitor as possible and the content on the Monitor itself. The program is actually 55 minutes long with about 25 minutes documenting the Monitor and about 30 minutes documenting the Navy's dive effort to raise the propeller and other artifacts. I really wish the battle had been better covered but overall this is a good program on the Monitor! The dive footage is excellent and documents the current condition of the Monitor's wreck underwater very well. Divers will love this program as well as civil war enthusiasts. I would recommend this program to a friend.",1390953600,2,1181,4.7560975609756095

8499735,4,B006JN87WU,"`Lincoln's Secret Weapon' is a DVD showing the story of the `Monitor', the first iron clad ship with a revolving gun turret and a submerged hull. It is a 60 minute film, which also contains the option for video descriptions, scene select, English subtitles and a printable teacher's guide.

We see a team of Navy divers attempting to recover and save the `Monitor' which lies in the Graveyard of the Atlantic off of Cape Hatteras. The importance of the ""Monitor' is shown along with some period reenactments, including the battle with the `Merrimack/CSSVirginia'. The history of the ships and ironclads and how they were built is explained, also using computer animation.
Much of the focus is on the team of Navy divers, the same ones who recovered the wreckage of Flight TWA 800. The problems and dangers of this dive and recovery are well done. The statement is made in the beginning that they will attempt to bring the ship up piece by piece, but what is attempted is the recovery of the ship's propeller and some pieces of the deteriorating iron bulkheads.

This DVD would be of interest to those who wish to learn more about the Civil War, shipwrecks and their recovery, or a part of naval history.",1331251200,4,1203,4.723809523809524
