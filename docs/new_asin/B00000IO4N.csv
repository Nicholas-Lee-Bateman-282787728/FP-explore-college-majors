7911252,4,B00000IO4N,"The only criticism I have is of the plummy British voiceover of DFD's speech. If this documentary ever appears on DVD (which it certainly should), I hope the voiceover is replaced with subtitles so that I can hear what he is actually saying in German.",1507507200,,251,4.6
7911253,5,B00000IO4N,"""Autumn Journey"" is a portrait, not a biography, and it is mostly told in Fischer-Dieskau's own words (and his voice-- he does the  English voiceover), as well as in photographs, and a vast amount of  performance and rehearsal footage that spans F-D's nearly 50-year career as  a musician, much of it entirely new to people outside of Germany. Although  I have been a FiDi fan for more than 30 years, at least half of the  material in ""Autumn Journey"" consisted of things I had never  seen. I especially treasure the little clips of F-D rehearsing  ""Geheimes"" with Gerald Moore and Bach's Cantata 82 with Karl  Richter and looking as if he were really enjoying what he was doing. And  then there's F-D performing ""Erlkoenig"" with Gerald Moore and  singing the final section of Britten ""War Requiem"": ""I am  the enemy you killed, my friend."" Or FiDi as Falstaff, improbable as  it always seems, or rehearsing for ""Il Tabarro"" with Julia Varady  and looking about as in love as anyone could look. There are also scenes of  him teaching and conducting, not to mention coaching Julia Varady in an  aria from ""Il Ballo in Maschera."" And for anyone who has not had  the chance to see F-D off the stage and out of costume and makeup, the  interview portions provide the opportunity to hear his speaking voice,  watch his expressions and gestures, and try to understand what made him  such a master communicator on the stage. The accompanying concert video is  from very late in F-D's career, and despite the obvious vocal decline, it  is a valuable document of the performance style of a master singer.",967507200,16,1595,4.7272727272727275
