8214397,4,6304609388,"First of all, I am ticked off at all the other reviews.  You don't buy a DVD to just hear the theme song.  You buy it for it's content (the show itself).  They didn't include the original theme because the creator of it wanted too much royalties to use it on the DVD.  Anyway, the DVD contained 3 episodes, ""Dogs, Dogs, Dogs (#93, where eleven stray dogs end up in the courthouse),"" ""High Noon in Mayberry (#80, where an ex-con comes to settle something with Andy),"" and ""Aunt Bee's Medicine Man (#87, where Aunt Bee gets drunk from 'medicine').""  The bonus features are only interactive menus (on all DVDs) and scene access (also on all DVDs).  But like I said before, you buy it for the show and nothing else.  The running time is 75 mins, and it is formatted for worldwide use.  The picture was great, and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound was awesome.  Highly recommended....",1017964800,21,874,4.515923566878981

Great fun and a reminder of why those early TV shows were so entertaining...good, clean, pure fun!  My only  disappointment...the original TV show's theme tune at the opening and  closing was not used on this DVD.  BIG let down!  Please bring it back  for future DVDs of other Mayberry greats.  Thanks!",946252800,9,393,4.848484848484849
