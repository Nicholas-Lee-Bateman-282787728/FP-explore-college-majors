6266723,3,B00IJXWIEQ,"This pairing of Parineeti Chopra and Sidarth Malhotra could have used a little fine tuning to keep it from dragging at times, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Saw the new release at the theatre and have watched it multiple times. I even have a couple of the songs on my playlist. Personal opinion: Parineeti's character was initially a little more eccentric (read weird!) than necessary, but I was entertained. She is a dynamic actress and Siddarth is another Bollywood hunk!",1400630400,,471,4.9
6266724,5,B00IJXWIEQ,"2014 has just begun and the cycle of new movies has just started to trickle in. There will be many movies in the coming months but I can safely say that Hasee to Phasee is going to be one of them.
Hasse to Phasee is a story about the meeting and falling in love of two unlikely people who should not have even messed with each other. It is also a collaboration between art and commercial cinema, a union of Anuarag Kashyap and Karan Johar, a union which I hope happens more often.
HTP is about two kids who meet at a wedding, all the trouble that ensues after that. Alright one has seen such movies in the past but this one is different because of the way it is treated.
It is about Nikhil (Siddharth Malhotra) who is about to get married to Karishma (Adah Sharma). He is trying to be a businessman but cannot get the breaks or the finances for that.
He falls in love with Meeta ( Parineeta Chopra) who is a genius but an eccentric one, whose talent is not appreciated by her traditional Gujarati family. She is a free spirited, impulsive person who has some serious issues.
Needless to say, that the movie is just fun after they meet. The treatment is amazing and so is the wonderfully written script with some terrific one liners.
Sidharth Malhotra is fun to watch. I didn't see his debut film but he is good.
Parineeta Chopra is simply outlandish and outstanding , so much talent that the screen literally explodes with her presence. She is the best actress that the screen has seen in a long time. I just hope that she gets commercial success very soon.
Songs are decent but the Zehnaseeb song is the best.
HTP is a great film and one of the best films to come out this year. It is about love, life and not to mention an amazing Parineeti Chopra. I had so much fun watching it. Five stars. 2/14/2014",1396742400,6,1803,4.321533923303835

6266727,4,B00IJXWIEQ,A fun movie. Good music.,1467417600,,24,4.0
6266728,4,B00IJXWIEQ,"Liked this movie a lot, would see it again. Not too heavy, not too fluff. Young love story but really well done.",1465603200,,112,4.136363636363637
6266729,4,B00IJXWIEQ,"It's about two misfits who all their lives have been unable to fit in with their respective families. It's about their fleeting chance encounter seven years ago and about their rocky present-day reunion. The plot goes like so: One week before his wedding, Nikhil Bharadwaj (Sidharth Malhotra) is charged by his actress fiance (Adah Sharma, in a thankless role) to keep her wayward sister, Meeta (Parineeti Chopra), away from her family, lest she ruin the impending festivities. What's Nikhil to make of Meeta? Meeta is an odd duck whose scandalous behavior seven years before literally broke her father's heart (man had a heart attack). Meeta is highly intelligent - with a degree in chemical engineering - and a non-conformist and tends to pop pills. Babysitting an unwanted sibling was the last thing Nikhil needed on his plate. He's having enough trouble amassing 50 million rupees, the lump sum of which will finalize the marriage contract.

You gaze at Nikhil and at Meeta and what you see is wasted potential. Nikhil is some sort of project manager or party planner, and it looks like he gets his funding by dint of begging for it. Meeta, she's just bad news at weddings. She's already ruined one sister's nuptials. Odds seem favorable for a repeat performance.

But what is Meeta's end game? Why show up after seven years of absence? And how long can Nikhil keep up his wheeling and dealing while riding herd over her?

Hasee Toh Phasee (translation: She Smiles, She's Snared!) is a breezy 2014 Hindi romantic comedy, and it runs 134 minutes, and that's a short duration for Bollywood. It's hard to create new material, and, no, there's nothing here that feels so original. Instead, what piques your interest, what drives the movie, are the two leads. It's only Sidharth Malhotra's second motion picture. It's only Parineeti Chopra's fourth motion picture. But they could teach a roomful of veteran actors about mutual alchemy and screen presence and what it takes to keep the audience parked on their butts. As much as I've enjoyed Priyanka Chopra - and it's awesome that she's the lead in Quantico - her cousin, Parineeti Chopra, blows her out of the water when it comes to acting, when it comes to leaving that indelible impression. Parineeti and Sidharth are naturals, and the camera loves them. And they generate such good chemistry you wish they were a couple in real life.

Hasee Toh Phasee does offer some comic beats such as Nikhil's skinny pal who can't help but bust out into song or beatbox. He is howlingly funny in that scene over the missing necklace. I also laughed at Nikhil's repeatedly waking up his prospective father-in-law in the middle of the night. But there's more here than just silly giggles. It's a film that makes much of abrupt departures and uneasy homecomings and chafing under your own skin. There is an emotionally-charged father-daughter reunion that will rivet you to your seat, and kudos to Parineeti and to Manoj Joshi for elevating that moment. Parineeti approaches her part without a trace of self-consciousness. She's brave, man. I don't know that other actresses would've gone for it the way she goes for it here, with the weird facial expressions she makes, the choices she makes. She creates these searing moments of heartbreak (like when she gets locked in a room or when she finally breaks down at the airport or that reunion with her dad).

This is a Hindi film so there must be song and dance. My favorite - and I'm not sure why - is ""Shake It Like Shammi."" If nothing else, these numbers hammer home again that dancing isn't Parineeti's strong suit. And that's okay. It's nice to know that Supergirl has her kryptonite.",1451088000,,3675,4.836248012718601
6266730,3,B00IJXWIEQ,"This movie is super cute but I only gave it three stars because the dvd itself came scratched so I couldn't watch a really important scene. Granted, I've seen the movie a thousand times before actually purchasing the dvd so I know what happens. I did not try to return it. I'll end up just buying another copy, eventually.",1449187200,,322,4.47457627118644

6266733,5,B00IJXWIEQ,"I watch this movie over and over.  Well, within reason.  It is delightful and so happy.  There are some swear words which I do not appreciate so be forewarned.  The characters are perfect.  The lead male is handsome but does not act like he knows it.  The dvd itself was of good quality.  Just wish they would not swear!",1438732800,,320,4.322033898305085

6266737,5,B00IJXWIEQ,"A fabulous Bollywood movie directed by Karan Johar. Parineeti Chopra acting range is truly remarkable, in her portrayal of someone with serious mental illness , but a huge heart, and by a series of wild circumstances wins the heart of Siddarth Malhotra, . Lovely in every way, the music is great I have seen this several times !",1434672000,,328,4.672413793103448

6266739,3,B00IJXWIEQ,"Just ok.  The story was a bit different, but I felt it wasn't very well connected.  The beginning dragged a little.  However IMO, the acting from the two main characters was pretty good and I liked their chemistry.",1428278400,,214,4.578947368421052
6266740,5,B00IJXWIEQ,"One of the best Indian movies I've seen in a long time, and probably one of the most accessible ones I've seen as well -- good for people who are new to Hindi cinema.  ""Hasee toh Phasee"" is a romantic comedy/drama with all the hallmarks of a classic Indian wedding film, but the elements are tossed together in a different way, so it feels fresh rather than formulaic, and all the focus is on the characters.  The comedy is subtle, as is the romance, and the soundtrack is surprisingly touching and evocative.  I honestly didn't expect it to have such good songs.

If you want a look at modern, middle-class India and characters with real-life, relateable problems and a funny family dynamic, give this a shot.  You'll enjoy it.  Also, I disagree with the review below.  The audio and subtitles were perfect.",1427500800,3,808,4.647887323943662

8642721,1,B00IJXWIEQ,"My wife says it's a good movie (she saw it in the theater).  However, I am giving it one star because it is unwatchable.  The sub-titles are placed mostly off the bottom of the screen (even zooming out to 1/2 size, the sub-titles are still cut off).  There is something flawed with how the DVD stores the sub-title information (we've tried two DVDs just to make sure it wasn't an isolated issue).

To make matters worse, the streaming version on Amazon loses all audio for about 30-40 minutes in the middle of the movie (unless it has been fixed) so that isn't really an option to see this movie either.",1501027200,,603,4.454545454545454

8642723,3,B00IJXWIEQ,I thought this was ok. Not as great as I hoped from some of the other reviews. Does Sidharth play anything else other then sullen and mopey?? Parineeti plays a very likable character tho and there's some enjoyable moments but overall I think you can do better.,1489622400,,260,4.553191489361702
