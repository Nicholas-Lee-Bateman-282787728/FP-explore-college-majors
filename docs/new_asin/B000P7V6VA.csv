2814501,5,B000P7V6VA,"This series came as a wonderful surprise; I had never heard of it and had low expectations.  But the consistent high quality of the interviews and the visuals, and the enormous diversity of the featured artists, makes it a stand-out in the art documentary genre.  It emphasizes each artist's sense of place, as well as illustrating the way creative traditions are fused with culture and passed down over generations.  A must-see for anyone interested in the creative process.",1205539200,13,475,5.064102564102564
2814502,5,B000P7V6VA,"This 3 hour dvd is a wonderful glimpse into skilled artisan/craftspeople that shows their studios, their inspirations, motivations, and technique.  Not a ""how to"" at all, but a ""why and how and who"".  HIGHLY recommend!",1203638400,12,218,5.2
2814503,5,B000P7V6VA,"What an exceptional series!  My daughter, who teaches art, encouraged us to purchase this series of programs because she was deeply inspired by watching one of the programs, so we gave it a try.  Wow!  What an adventure, visiting amazing, inspiring people from all across the country, and feasting on the rich diversity of gorgeous, works of crafted art!  You meet delightful, funny, earthy, courageous people of many different ""types"" who share their lives and works.  You see them doing their work, gathering in communities, struggling to find their way through life... and bearing the mosts beautiful, diverse works!  The quality of the creations makes it harder to discern art from craft.  But the best part is just delighting in story after story  of amazing people, the moving accounts of their life journeys, to communities that sustain them, and their awesome works of art!  Another delight is the photography of the people and the environments from which their works arise.  The filming and editing are exceptionally beautiful and often powerful!",1189987200,30,1055,5.152941176470589

2814505,5,B000P7V6VA,This series of Craft in America is a very fine one.  We enjoyed every craft person and learned more about that person's life as well as their work.,1353974400,,147,4.25
2814506,5,B000P7V6VA,This is an excellent program for inspiration.  It was especially insightful to learn of families who work together in crafting.,1331856000,,127,5.35
2814507,5,B000P7V6VA,"If you are interested in American crafts this is a wonderful documentary of artists in America.  An expansive review including all the handmade arts;  wood turning, jewelry making, quilting, ceramics, glass, and many more.  It is very moving to have the artists talk about the creative process.  A wonderful gift for anyone that loves the arts or is creative.",1322352000,2,359,5.033898305084746
2814508,5,B000P7V6VA,"If you grew up watching the PBS children's program ""Reading Rainbow"", you may remember the occasional vignette showing brief glimpses into the working lives of people from different professions: railroad engineers, artists, scientists, authors, musicians, etc. These segments were so simple, yet extremely memorable. Levar Burton would take a break from narrating, and you would be left with just the person in their element, speaking to the viewer about their life. It was like getting to meet these people and accompanying them to their workplace for the day.

""Craft in America"" feels like an extended, slightly more elaborate version of those ""Reading Rainbow"" vignettes, focusing on talented craftspeople throughout the United States. The bulk of the footage is simply these artists at work, set to a soundtrack of their own voices describing their history, process, motivations, inspiration, and the quirks of their craft. Again, very simple. But also refreshing in its simplicity in this age of glossy television, manipulated, teased, and edited beyond recognition for maximum drama and suspense.

In many ways, ""Craft in America"" feels oddly homey and familiar, almost predictable, down to a rendition of the Quaker song ""Simple Gifts"" in the title sequence. Yet its predictability is more an asset than liability. The filming feels free of gimmick and the interviews feel candid, honest, and low-key. There's no agenda here other than to document American craft. This transparent approach, which could have amounted to a middle-of-the-road insipidity, is saved by the thoughtful artists themselves, who come across as imaginative, dedicated, and quite grounded. Something about working with materials that come straight from the earth (clay, iron, plants), with inspiration drawn from their own personal histories and their own neighborhoods, seems to imbue these people with a humility and plainspoken wisdom.

They all make astute observations about American culture, how we relate to each other and to the objects we use or own, without sounding in any way pretentious or out-of-touch. As a viewer, I was left with a sense of appreciation for the little flourishes in everyday objects around me: a little angular handle on my coffee mug, the clean corners of my work desk, some unusual metal bookends I had lying around. Someone, somewhere, had put thought into the design of these objects. It made me notice and want more of these sorts of things: the work of human hands, so rare in these days of mass-manufactured everything.

Each episode (five in total, about an hour each) showcases three artists, allowing us ample time to get to know each in terms of personality, artistic sensibility, and history. Highly recommended.",1314921600,3,2738,5.316397228637413
2814509,5,B000P7V6VA,"I teach art, and NEVER show ""movies"" in class.  But after seeing this series on PBS, I have bought seasons 1 and 2, and always make time to show them in my Crafts class.  The kids love the stories of each craftsperson, and the irreverant, fun-loving humor of the artists really speaks to the kids.  Awesome series!",1308096000,2,314,4.473684210526316

I find this dvd to be a nice addition to my personal collection.  Enjoy, Vicki Stone",1260144000,,253,4.340425531914893
2814512,5,B000P7V6VA,"I love this video.  I have seen the series on PBS and I have watched the DVD.  I continue to draw inspiration from the artists and the rich history of craft in America.

If your creative batteries are running low or if you want to see examples of how people live/think differently through their art, you should watch this DVD.

There are so many talented, dedicated artists in this series, and I love how idiosyncratic and unconventional they are.  They live outside the mainstream and yet their work is such a part of who were are as Americans.  Potter David Gurney, Jewelry maker Kit Carson and so many others will leave you wanting more out of the way you live your life and interact with the world around you.  They may inspire you to live more artfully.

I can't recommend this DVD highly enough.",1223164800,4,801,4.513888888888889
2814513,5,B000P7V6VA,"I love PBS and this one is no exception.  Thoughtful, thought provoking and beautifully filmed.  It has it all.  I loved seeing the diversity of work being produced and seeing the artists talk about how they see their own work.",1215475200,4,227,4.625

8189781,5,B000P7V6VA,"I am such a fan of the Craft in America series. For the longest time I have only had one DVD and played it incessantly for inspiration and information... I loved it and have so enjoyed adding this Season 2 DVD into the rotation.
Craft in America is beautifully imagined and as beautifully produced.",1447113600,,298,4.537037037037037
8189782,5,B000P7V6VA,"All of the Craft in America series is outstanding. It's heartening -- especially in these automated, technology driven times -- to witness the commitment and craft of these incredible American artists, and it's an honor and a privilege to support and help sustain this craftsmanship.",1406851200,,283,5.311111111111111

8189784,5,B000P7V6VA,"It is the time that the artist excels past the mechanics to expression that make you want to try the different arts for yourself.

Every once in a while there is a clinker. But for the most part you will want to repeat watching.

It helps that I have already dabbled in a lot of the arts so I can tell that whoever chose the individual artists excelled in the choice.

The presentation is in episodes like Memory, Landscape, and Community. I am not sure of the significance. I just watched from one end of the DVD to the next. Two good points about this presentation. One it is not in sound bite form where all the artists say one thing then all the artists says anointer. Second it tells a little history of how the artist came to a point in life where he/she decides to be an artist instead of a drone in society.

I know that the series cannot be everything for everybody, however I would have liked them to have slow down to shoe more of the mechanical details of each craft.",1374883200,,979,4.247311827956989
8189785,5,B000P7V6VA,"this CD is totally different from the individual CD's by season. Still is good, but there are Crafts people missing from the original series. I would recommend that you buy each Season.",1367193600,3,185,4.8125
8189786,5,B000P7V6VA,"As a crafts person , I find this series quite uplifting and also rather honest.
Staying true to one's inspiration and passion can be challenging in a world which seems to obsess on efficiency and automation - not to mention a far cheaper labor pool overseas. To me, viewing this series can feel like a reassuring hug when those pressures make you question the very fire that feeds your soul.
It helps to answer the question:
Craft In America - Why do we do this?
We do this because it is important.
These are the very things that make us who we are. The titles of each segment explain it well; It is what connects us to our history, family, our community. It is communication and contemplation. Collectively, it is a distillation of the American spirit. The interviews are a glimpse into the diverse personalities and motivations that bring us back to who we are..
and - bonus! - it is a frequently entertaining, thought provoking, and often inspiring slice of life we are invited to share.

FYI - The DVD set ""The Craft In America Collection"" includes the following episodes:
Memory
Landscape
Community
Origins
Process
Messages
Family

The two episodes
Threads
and
Crossroads
are currently not in this set and are sold individually.

Enjoy!!",1358208000,15,1242,4.767441860465116

The  elaborately decorated  high top sneakers featured on the front cover of the dvd enticed me ....and I knew that my artist/crafts person daughter would appreciate viewing the design used there, so I bought this as a Christmas present for her....it comforts me to know that anytime I want to watch this mesmerizing program again, I can !",1356480000,,456,5.148648648648648
