Unbelievably poor acting, poor scripting, and poor filming!  Save your money and your time...avoid this movie!",1404000000,5,253,4.976190476190476

6339593,1,B00J925YGU,Sounds like a bad circus act as the score and has to be the worst acting I've ever seen! I'm surprised this made Netflix!,1403222400,3,121,4.083333333333333

6339595,1,B00J925YGU,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. It was on Netflicks and my son wanted to see it. Truly terrible acting, mind-numbingly stupid script, poor sound on the indoor scenes, jerky scene cuts, an obviously 60-something woman playing a young boy's mother... It has amateur written all over it. How it got distribution at all is a mystery.",1402099200,7,344,4.8474576271186445

8648854,3,B00J925YGU,"Very boring movie.  Yes, the dog disappears, but plot is thin and does not keep you attention.  It arrived timely and in good condition.",1481328000,,136,4.625
8648855,5,B00J925YGU,Very funny movie. love watching over and over again,1464480000,,51,4.777777777777778
8648856,1,B00J925YGU,"Quite possibly the least expensive movie ever made. The entire movie was shot in some guy's house. The secret lab was just a garage with a drop cloth over the walls and the secret 'safe' was obviously just a front loading washing machine. It was generally a terrible movie. My 6 year old daughter cried until she fell asleep and her twin brother only watched it to make her mad.

The only interesting thing about the movie was that Chris Farley's brother played the dad. I didn't even know that he had a brother. He was the best actor in the bunch.",1422576000,,548,4.372549019607843
8648857,1,B00J925YGU,"It's pretty hard to make a bad kids' film with an animal as the main star, but somehow these film makers have managed to do it.  You'd think it would be easy to come up with a lot of fun situations for an invisible dog to get in, tormenting cats, stealing meat from a butcher, tormenting postmen (there is a postman in this one but nothing happens), licking strangers who don't know what's happening, maybe someone who thinks they're making out with a human, barking and an innocent dog being blamed, there's so many options.  The on film part for the dog is pretty minor when you consider it should have been central to the plot.  The acting by the humans is terrible.  When they are supposed to be holding or wrestling with the invisible dog, you'd think they would have atleast practiced with the real dog, filmed it and tried to re-enact it or something.  It just doesn't look believeable at all the way they've done it.  At one stage the hired hit man is wrestling with the dog and it is peeing in his mouth, that doesn't even make sense.  When do real dogs do this when you're wrestling with them.  Why not have gone for the age old have him standing there and suddenly noticing a spray against his leg joke that is in countless visible dog films?

None of the kid characters are likeable at all, especially the older girl who constantly refers to one of the boys as a loser.  The only thing the writers could come up with to make these kids funny was passing gas jokes.  The villains and FBI agents were too stupid to be plausible.  What happened to the scientists from the start?  Surely your invisible formula is stolen and you'd be right on the scene and following up any leads.",1414972800,,1688,4.406451612903226
8648858,1,B00J925YGU,"Terrible movie.  I was so disappointed!  Wanted a fun movie to watch with our 9 1/2 year old grandson.  So far (I turned it off) they've taken the Lord's name in vain twice, used one swear word, and one filthy slang word, starting with ""f"".  :-(

YUCK and double yuck!  It's going in the trash.  I'm so sorry I trusted the review from The Dove Foundation.",1408579200,2,355,4.287878787878788
8648859,1,B00J925YGU,"Got this from Netflix.  The worst movie I've ever seen.  Did they make it with a cell phone camera?  Pick up actors from a homeless shelter?  Stupid characters, ridiculous plot, BAD BAD acting.  Awful.  Don't spend a cent on this movie.",1404518400,3,236,4.634146341463414
