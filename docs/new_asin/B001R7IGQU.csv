8337513,4,B001R7IGQU,"Cute and catchy as usual, but it's all done in a studio with added computer graphics as opposed to studio plus outdoor shots like Big Red Car, etc. There are also very few animals in it and they make very brief cameo appearances--as another reviewer noted, the ""animals"" are Wiggles and Wiggles dancers in animal costumes. Very cute, but my 2 y/o loves animals and would rather see them. I personally like Wiggle Safari with Steve Irwin much, much better--plenty of live animals and far more more educational information on the animals.

If you're looking for a DVD with animals, go for Wiggles Safari. If you like the show format, try Big Red Car/Boat. If you just want some background music and videos, I would get You Make Me Feel Like Dancing before I got this one.

As negative as I sound, it's still Wiggles and your kids will probably still love it! The music is great and fun to sing and dance to, and the Wiggles deliver their usual high-energy entertaining performance. I highly recommend the soundtrack to this DVD--my whole family enjoys the CD.",1273363200,3,1057,4.67741935483871
8337514,3,B001R7IGQU,"I ordered this DVD in the hopes that my 2 yr. old would watch it like he did previous Wiggles DVDs.  Instead he still insists on Sing A Song Of Wiggles (DVD), Pop Goes The Wiggles (DVD), and You Make Me Feel Like Dancing (DVD).  These are very good and he would highly recommend them over Go Banannas and I agree.",1257552000,3,313,4.114754098360656
