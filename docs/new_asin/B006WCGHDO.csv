5023819,2,B006WCGHDO,"This Interesting subject was very poorly presented. The subject was difficult to follow.  The video was clear, the sound quality was poor and the overall presentation was amateurish. The Speaker may be brilliant but he did a poor job of explaining his work and an even poorer job presenting his conclusions. It left me wanting a better explanation.",1343433600,4,348,5.0
5023820,3,B006WCGHDO,"First of all I am truly a fan of Courtney Brown and the work he is doing. He is definitely onto something and I am watched all the youtube clips and interviews many times.

And this was the PROBLEM!

There is nothing in the DVD that is not available on the web and infact, the farsight.org website.

I was hoping for a Remote Viewing 101 or some behind the scenes clips etc etc.

Nevertheless, many a times I have thought of donating to the FARSIGHT org and buying this DVD is my way of supporting them.

Furthermore, you never know, some of those clips on youtube may be removed in future and so having this DVD allows a permanent collection.

Anyway, my hats off to you folks at Farsight and for the work you are doing.",1340841600,21,721,4.264705882352941
5023821,5,B006WCGHDO,"While mainstream scientists insist on using defunct tools and methodologies that, by definition, cannot reach into multidimensional universes, a few other scientists are brave enough to jump out of the old mainstream comfort zones and truly explore our universe. Courtney Brown is one of these pioneers. He does not offer an ""answer"" what he offers however is one potential and partial explanation about timelines. More importantly he opens up our minds to further questions and by questioning his theories we are opening our own minds beyond the constrictive and mechanical approach of mainstream science. I recommend you listen to the last section of this DVD more than once. Dr. Brown speaks quickly, but as I listen to it a second time, a third time - each time I catch a glimpse of what he is talking about and it starts to make sense. Listening to his DVD has helped me identify my own unconscious and preconceived notions about time/space. One interesting statement Courtney makes is that he was not trying to predict the future but rather to describe one possible future. I know Courtney is on to something big - I can't explain it yet in human language yet but I can almost see it - feel it...  If you want to expand your own consciousness, I challenge you to watch this DVD.",1329782400,15,1284,4.757847533632287

8505509,2,B006WCGHDO,"As a ""far seer"" myself, (albeit NOT trained by special Army operatives interested in spying), it had some interesting conclusions to offer re useful info, of possible future events & natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, etc, but overall was too dry for such a juicy subject. I think it is over-priced and under-delivers at that cost, although I see it is around $22 now, and not the $31 that I paid just a few weeks ago.",1377734400,,434,4.64935064935065
8505510,5,B006WCGHDO,"I loved it. It is well done and extremely interesting.
Remote viewing has always been one of my favorite subjects.

8505511,2,B006WCGHDO,"Description sorely lacking in details. Series of lectures incomprehensible to anyone with only a B.S. in Economics.
I still don't know what the Farsight Experiments are.",1363737600,,169,5.538461538461538
8505512,5,B006WCGHDO,"I thought this was a well-explained description of the experiments, the scientific methods and the results / hyothises.

As usual with science documentaries, I am left wanting more. I am hoping for much more after June 2013. Can't wait to see what happens!",1360713600,,256,4.953488372093023
8505513,2,B006WCGHDO,"Not that great, beyond me and not believable. Too much talking and not enough pictures, and explanation of drawings poor.",1355702400,,121,5.1
8505514,3,B006WCGHDO,"Thought provoking material, but the author needs to learn some presentation skills. He's so absorbed in his world he has no idea how to communicate it succinctly, in a visual medium, beyond banging the same old drum. Viewing it left me with more questions than answers - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this case, they were mostly the same questions I had before watching it, not new ones stimulated by new information. So ""E"" for Effort and definitely worth a look if the subject is new to you.",1354579200,,507,4.582417582417582
8505515,5,B006WCGHDO,Courtney Brown describes remote viewing method in detail and discoveries that remote viewers made. To predict the future accurately is not easy because the parallel futures may be accessed instead. He describes the method how to prevent it. Enjoyed it a lot.,1347235200,4,258,5.166666666666667
8505516,5,B006WCGHDO,"This DVD gives you a great introduction and overview of the research done by the Farsight institute on Remote Viewing.
Courtney Brown does a really good job of describing the methods used to prove that Remove Viewing is not some weird technique developed by some crazy guys in Pentagon black projects. Instead the Farsight institute can scientifically prove that remote viewing actually works. Go figure!!!
Not every aspect of it has been understood yet but this is normal for new discoveries I suppose.
Courtney Brown comes across as an intelligent and very careful scientist that really cares about the clean execution of the experiments.
This DVD really stands out compared to other information you get on topics like that.
So, get a copy when you are interested in some really good in depth information about RV.
I give it 5 stars. These guys have done a great job so far, and I hope we will hear more about their research and discoveries!",1345161600,2,943,4.827160493827161
8505517,5,B006WCGHDO,"WOW!  Great video! Also a huge farsight.org fan, but maybe I'm a little less sophisticated than another reviewer.  Thought this dvd laid out the experiments very logically and clearly for newbies like me.  Courtney Brown does a great job explaining and championing the science of remote viewing.  I appreciate his time and effort!",1344211200,5,330,5.169811320754717
