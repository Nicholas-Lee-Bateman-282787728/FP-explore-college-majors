7125598,5,B00W7AHDX8,"picks up great from where season 1 left off, a new year, new opponents and new forces trying to destroy the world. Jaden gets a new deck and new allies to combat the new evil, definitely good pacing too, I would recommend this if your a GX fan/",1438905600,,244,4.104166666666667

7125600,5,B00W7AHDX8,"I love the fact that I got to purchase this season, especially since I missed the middle part of it when it was on TV. It was fun watching all of the duels that I missed the first time & rewatching the end of the season again.",1436745600,,226,3.8297872340425534
7125601,5,B00W7AHDX8,"*I received a review copy of this show in exchange for an honest review

I confessed back in May my addiction for Yu-Gi-Oh! cards and my recent viewing of the sub-series, Zexal.  I enjoyed Zexal, and I was looking forward to checking out other Yu-Gi-Oh! titles in the series soon.  Thankfully, I didn't have to wait long.  The fine folks at Cinedigm have released season 2 of the iconic GX set, and I have to admit:  its better than Zexal!

I stated after watching Zexal that I would have to start playing the card game because I enjoyed the show so much.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to meet that goalbut it is definitely still on the table.  Although I haven't seen season 1, the second season of GX has re-sparked my desire to start playing.

YU-GI-OH!: GX is almost a darker, grittier version of Zexal.  Whereas Zexal has a light and somewhat comedic tone, GX is a bit more serious in some aspects.  Sure, the dialogue is still cheesy and the character animations are campybut the stakes seem to be higher and therefore the intensity level of the whole show is amped up a bit.

As with Zexal, the monsters and card imagery in YU-GI-OH!: GX are drawn well and are displayed with true vibrancy onscreen.  The diversity of creatures and cards, however, seems less than in later series.  This is not a detraction from the show at all, but it does seem worth mentioning.

Still, YU-GI-OH!: GX season 2 is a big win for me, and I recommend it.  Fans of anime will enjoy this tame little brother to the original show, and newbies to the series will find it a great starting point.  The box set is available now, so give it a look.",1436313600,,1628,4.445945945945946

7125603,5,B00W7AHDX8,"Oh yes, I've been waiting for this for a long time, well since I finished my season 1 dvd, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh series and I can't wait to own season 2. We meet new characters and even a new villain, and Aster Phoenix appears! I recommend this even though it is english dubbed, support the releases and maybe they will dub season 4 for us!",1435536000,4,355,4.235294117647059
