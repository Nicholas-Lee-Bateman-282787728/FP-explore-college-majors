395348,5,6301969111,"Appearing very near to the end of the great musicals era, It's Always Fair Weather has been a neglected movie and the main storyline is set around a tv show!

The restoration is decent without being stunning, the print is in perfect condition. The movie was shot in Cinemascope which was an anamorphic process, so expect plenty of film grain as those little crawling dots have been stretched sideways by a lot!

It's a very dated but great fun movie and has the 'I like myself' stunning roller skate dance routine as well a splendid Cyd Charisse solo set in a boxing gym.

Do check out the extras and watch the Michael Kidd solo which was cut from the film allegedly because Gene Kelly didn't like him doing a dance routine with a group of children as that was his domain!",1486166400,3,772,4.460992907801418
395349,5,6301969111,"I bought this not so long ago on DVD... then they bought it out on Blue Ray!!! Grrrr....

Still though this is a very enjoyable movie musical with Gene Kelly dancing on skates and Cyd Charisse working out in the gym, Baby, You Knock Me Out!

Ably supported by Dan Daily and Michael Kidd who along with Kelly do the great ash can lid dance, as 3 returned war time buddies who vow to meet 10 years later for their reunion only to find they have changed greatly, or have they?

Worth having for the great use of the 2:35.1 scope screen and imaginative use for dancing. Remastered with DTS 5.1.",1485820800,5,590,4.297297297297297

395351,5,6301969111,"La La Land began here apparently. This is no major award winning film although it did receive two Oscar nominations for its music. This was a favourite of La La's director and the signature touches of M-G-M's big widescreen musicals are here - and as in La La, a bittersweet approach which the writers of Fair Weather explain was the reason for its box office failure. It did open at Radio City Music Hall (contrary to their commentary!) and it has some lovely parts. This blu ray print is not perfect, but very good only in parts, and some parts (like the two times the guys enter the street from the Bar) are plain bad - like a pirated VHS for a few seconds - as noted in the blu ray reviews.  Anything with Gene Kelly & Cyd Charisse is amazing, plus Dan Dailey plus Michael Kidd in his only real on screen appearance - and it is a must because it is the last of M-G-M's golden musical era....only Gigi and Molly Brown were to follow and it ended on a real high!!!",1485648000,5,966,4.25

395354,4,6301969111,"Dancing with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse...  Music by Andre Previn...  All the pieces are in place...  However the movie never comes together and is now largely forgotten.  It is not that some of the dancing acts are very good to excellent.  For me personally, Gene Kelly dancing on roller skates makes watching the entire movie worth the effort.  Unfortunately effort is what it is.

This movie is somewhat dark and cynical.  It simply is not why I watch a musical.  I am not left feeling good.  It is no surprise to me that this movie was not a commercial success.  It was the last of the big MGM musical extravaganzas.  I do not know if there is a cause and effect.

I am absolutely glad that I saw this movie.  There certainly are parts of this movie that I will be glad to see again.  However the movie is dark and downbeat and is not what I am looking for in a musical.  Thank You...",1484697600,3,889,4.265060240963855
395355,3,6301969111,"It's Always Fair Weather is not an easily digestible musical, meaning, it fails to meet traditional expectations for a frothy feel good. That said, there is so much to admire herein, from Gene Kelly's exquisite solo on roller skates to Cyd Charisse's electric dance with a bunch of pugilists at Stillman's Gym, to the haughty Dolores Gray exuding a spider woman's 'charm' singing 'Thanks A Lot But No Thanks'. It's Always Fair Weather is a charmer with one notable flaw - no pas deux for Kelly and Charisse - for shame! And more's the pity it failed to attract the sort of box office as a Singin' In the Rain or American in Paris. A lot of talent went into the film - not all of it coming out unscathed. But again - it's a darker themed movie with some really good stuff to be had. Warner Archive has done a competent job remastering the movie for Blu-ray. There are fundamental flaws built in that I sincerely doubt could have been helped by throwing even more time and money on this effort. Two optical zooms (always looking bad) are exaggerated herein by the clarity of the Blu-ray rendering each a muddy, grainy mess. Again, no fault to the archive's efforts. Color is inconsistent throughout, a flaw of early Eastman Kodak stock. Thank heaven this one wasn't photographed in the even more inferior Ansco Color. Enjoy this one for what it is - an ambitious, flawed effort from a creative team with all their pistons firing in unison.",1484006400,4,1437,4.595330739299611

395357,4,6301969111,"It's Always Fair Weather came at the tail end of the classic MGM musical era. It was originally meant as a sort of sequel to On the Town. When tat didn't pan out Gene Kelly was teamed with Dan Dailey & Michael Kidd. They played 3 sailors just home from WW2. They vow to meet again in 10 years which they do only to realize they can't stand one another. It's a bit of a bitter pill for a musical, but it actually plays a lot better today than when it was made. Cyd Charisse & Dolores Gray fill out the distaff side. The musical numbers are imaginative and take advantage of the dancing skills of the cast. 2 highlights are Kelly's number on roller skates and the 3 sailors dancing with garbage can covers. Charisse shows off her gorgeous legs & figure dancing with sparring boxers in a gym. The film was actually ahead of its time as it ends with.a reality TV show surprising the sailors! The video and audio transfer is excellent from Warner Archives. You won't be disappointed.",1482364800,5,978,4.3791208791208796

395418,4,6301969111,"It's a shame Warner slowed down transferring their classics/musical catalog to bluray and then again choosing peripheral titles, as is the case of the present item.
Always good to watch, Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse and Stanley Donen could do no wrong, but this is one of their lesser efforts. Of special interest is the presence of Dolores Gray, a wonderful singer and actress, in one of her only 4 movie outings for MGM.
The transfer is quite good, much superior to the recent Silk Stockings bluray edition, with good definition and color saturation.
An entertaining outing, worth having if you're a fan of MGM musicals like me.
I only hope Warner remember such great ones as Brigadoon, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, High Society, Les Girls... well I could go on and on.

395576,3,6301969111,"This is one of those ""forgotten"" musicals that's somewhat deserving of its forgotten status. Yes, it's dated and is definitely less than the sum of its parts. But there are three great numbers that make it worthwhile sitting through:

First is Kelly's happy, uplifting number performed on roller skates, ""I Like Myself"". Second is Cyd Charisse's exuberant dance with a group of boxers at a gym, ""Baby You Knock My Out"". Third is the hilarious spoof of Marilyn Monroe performed by Dolores Gray, ""Thanks a Lot, But No Thanks"".

Frankly though, these three excerpts can be found in reasonably decent quality on youtube. The story, which centers around three war buddies who have lost touch ten years after WWII , with some mild spoofing of the early TV variety shows of the era, doesn't hold up too well today. I'm not sure it even worked back in the day, as you don't really care whether these old friends reunite or not. And unfortunately Kelly and Charisse show the same lack of chemistry that doomed ""Brigadoon"". Despite a few strong productions of middling songs that can't hold up on their own merits, this film doesn't have the charm or staying power to rank with the best of the MGM ""B-list"" musicals, such as ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"". Let's put this one in the ""C"" list.",1433635200,5,1285,4.706666666666667

Well, I - like theater goers in the 1950s - found this musical to be heavy, dark and uncomfortable to sit through as war buddies pledging life long friendship reunite to find that their lives since their exploits have pulled them in directions apart from one and other.  Even Delores Gray as the comedy relief can't save this story.",1420848000,2,465,4.590361445783133

395640,1,6301969111,"If everyone loved this charmless film back then, as much as they seem to do now, it might have been a hit - but it was a spectacular failure. The songs are poor, Gene Kelly's plastic grin and paper thin charm had well and truly gone, and Dan Dailey, who must have been the most joyless musical performer in musicals, is just depressing. And what did anyone ever see in Dolores Gray? Michael Kidd was a wonderful choreographer but he belonged behind the camera and not in front of it, which is obvious in some of the trimmed footage. This film helped end an era of musical comedy gold, and that's what's so depressing about it. All these great performers were at the end of their contracts by this period, and it's sad that they didn't go out with something terrific. The number with the dustbin lids is wonderful, and the only good thing in the film. But what's it in the film for exactly?  And that's the huge problem with this film. There's nothing remotely joyous to hang the songs and dances, for this type of musical, on. Three people meet up again after many years and discover that they don't like each other any more. So in an attempt to lighten up this real, but miserable premise, all the songs and dances have no purpose. Everything feels pasted on, and the two elements clash. On The Town has a paper thin plot, but it's perfect to hang song and dance on. Three sailors who have to be back on the ship in 24 hours want to have a great time. So that's open to fun. This plot isn't. One thing I would say however is that some of the great Bernstein numbers from the original score for On The Town that they criminally dropped - would work really well in this film.",1419638400,,1674,4.3312101910828025
395641,4,6301969111,"This musical keeps growing on me, until now it's one of my Top 10 musicals. Every time I watch it...

1) I'm more impressed with the quality and details of Dolores Gray's performances. In her first number, just watch the movements of her hands and tilt of her face--she's like an orchestra of nuance and expression selling that song!

2) I feel stronger emotions in the final scenes.
This plot probably seems weak to younger people, but when you get old enough that you can compare your young dreams to the (less impressive) reality of your life today, and when your life's closest friendships are years in the past... this movie will evoke some powerful feelings. But it leaves the audience with hope for a second try, not a ""that's life"" acceptance of failure.

I think you need to be at least 48 to really get this movie. For those younger, there's still plenty of entertaining numbers. Despite its historically dated references, ""Thanks a Lot But No Thanks"" is just plain FUN to watch! While most musicals look vaudevillian in their influences, this one doesn't. It's more modern, much more Broadway, with more than a nod to TV as a performance genre.

There's a lot in this movie, but it REALLY deserves Blu-ray treatment to bring it to a broader audience.",1418774400,,1261,4.6923076923076925

395787,3,6301969111,"After its classics ""Singin'In The Rain"" and ""The Band Wagon"",MGM's legendary Freed Unit went into a down period that lasted until ""Gigi"".""It's Always Fair Weather"" is a typical Freed film of that time,good but not great. It's a downbeat story of three
WWII friends who reunite ten years later,only to find themselves all unhappy and barely knowing each other. The good cast is helped by some tuneful songs and good musical numbers,but the script lets them down big-time. It's hard to believe this film was written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green,the same team that had so brilliantly done ""Rain"" and ""Wagon"".This time,they tried for another light-hearted ""On The Town""-like romp(the original idea was to use that show's three sailors),but instead created a dark and virtually humor-free social commentary. Add this to flat,slow Gene Kelly-Stanley Donen direction(they were barely speaking by now,and Stanley later said Gene didn't get along with anyone throughout production),and you have a lifeless movie that only works in fits and spurts.""It's Always Fair Weather"" is a typical MGM B musical-entertaining, but no classic.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singin-in-the-Rain-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00006DEF9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singin' in the Rain (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Town/dp/B00143XE1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Town</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Always-Fair-Weather-1955-Movie-Soundtrack-Rhino-Handmade/dp/B0001LYFYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Always Fair Weather (1955 Movie Soundtrack) (Rhino Handmade)</a>",1311120000,,1710,7.47029702970297
395788,3,6301969111,"The musical film It's Always Fair Weather has the charm of an MGM musical. The dance numbers are wonderful (of course, because Gene Kelly is in them) and the story line is unique and interesting. One of the best dance numbers is performed with the three GI's dancing on the street. At one point all three of the men are dancing with trash can lids on their feet. The numbers are skillful but not boring. The film keeps humor at the forefront of the numbers, which I think is one of it's strongest qualities. The number with one of the GIs making a drunken scene at a party is a great example of this. He dances wildly and at one point even puts a lampshade on his head. Like any musical, there is a love story. And, of course, Gene Kelly gets the girl. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie because I feel like it had a lot of talented stars in it. From Broadway stars to movie stars, the film is packed with people who deliver solid performances. My favorite number in the film is one in which Gene Kelly does an entire dance number on roller skates. I am always amazed at his talent, but this number specifically surprised me. The film also has a unique plotline that keeps you interested. The fact that after years of living separate lives the once best friends can not even stand to have a meal together leaves you wondering whether or not they will ever like each other again. Of course, because it is MGM, things work out in the end for the GI's and they are again close friends. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes classic movies or to anyone that enjoys great vocal and dance numbers.",1305072000,,1602,4.343333333333334
395789,5,6301969111,"It's Always Fair Weather is a film that will have you smiling from beginning to end. Gene Kelly is marvelous in this film as are the other two lead characters. The script, music, plot and cinematography are really, really spot on. Made in CinemaScope, this film is quite an experience. Without question, one of the most memorable scenes from the film is the scene in which Gene Kelly dances and sings while on roller blades--amazing! You cannot help but fall in love with this film and the characters. I smiled the entire time I watched this film. There are moments that a modern audience can't help but laugh but that makes the film all the more endearing and attractive. If you are in need of a fun, up-lifting film, pop this one in and have a good night. The part of the film where the three men are forced to be on a TV show is just great. It's a wonder that musicals aren't as big of a hit as they were in the `50s... if only there was another Gene Kelly. This film has great social commentary in that the plot is centered on the aftermath of WWII and the affect the war had on the lives of soldiers. The way life is illustrated in this film is touching; the connection that the three men shared during the war filters out as they go on their way after the war. This film is an interesting and colorful take on society in the aftermath of a war. At just 102 minutes, all viewers will wish this film was longer.  This film is perfect for anyone looking for a feel-good film. If you're a Gene Kelly fan or a musical fan, this film will make you want more musicals!",1304899200,,1567,4.258389261744966

Ten years later they do, only to find each one has changed into someone the others don't like. The story displays the changes in culture after the war and its central theme is that time changes people, but ultimately there is still time for redemption. Its a feel good musical and its over the top style may seem goofy at first but adds to the movie's charm as it progresses. A must for fans of musicals.",1303948800,,557,4.264150943396227
395791,2,6301969111,"I would not recommend this musical to anyone unless they just have to complete their collection of Gene Kelly movies.

The story is a typical formula for this type of movie and time.  Dreadful dialogue; worse plot.  I couldn't wait till it ended.

The dancing however is great and a cut version with just that would be worth the entire movie.",1301356800,,342,4.557377049180328

395899,5,6301969111,"This is not your typical MGM musical, and that's good for all of us. What sets it apart is the way authors Betty Comden and Adolph Green have shaped the characters. These are not perfect, starry-eyed lovers. These are complicated people who have suffered life's disappointments and are forced to grapple with them. They are downcast and frequently bad-tempered. I can't think of an earlier musical that dared such a treatment, with the exception of Pal Joey.

And yet, the maturity and darkness of this story are precisely what make it work and why the movie holds up so well today, better than many more-naive musicals, wonderful though they are. How many of us have looked back on our lives, saddened that they did not turn out as we had hoped? What we have left at the end of the day are our friendships and loves - the things that really mattered anyway. That's what Gene Kelly, Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd discover in this musical story of disillusionment and redemption.

But that may be putting too heavy a mark on this film, which is also full of exuberance, melody and wit. Gene Kelly's number, ""I Like Myself,"" is a miracle; I watch it and shake my head at its complexity and grace. Dolores Gray is hilarious as a mawkish TV hostess who is a complete egomaniac. And Cyd Charisse turns in a superb performance as a cynical woman who learns the value of sincerity (her number, ""Baby, You Knock Me Out"" is terrific).

""It's Always Fair Weather"" was probably ahead of its time in 1955. Decades later, it seems to better fit our times, in which irony is the common coin of our pop-culture language. This film is a personal favorite and I always enjoy introducing others to its many pleasures.",1268611200,5,1697,4.612582781456954
395900,5,6301969111,"This film is a relatively neglected example of one of the MGM classic musicals.  Michael Kidd and Gene Kelly both worked on the choreography, and although the story is a little bit weak, the singing and dancing is excellent.  Watch out for the dance with the dustbin lids!",1247529600,,272,4.645833333333333
395901,5,6301969111,"A great musical and very contemporary specially for that genre of film. Great dance numbers and a bitter story, not so conventional for musicals. The last big musical  closing a golden era.",1236038400,2,189,4.90625
395902,3,6301969111,"I just had my first look at this on DVD with it boasting a restored print and in widescreen CinemaScope. I had only seen this one other time, years ago on a formatted-to-TV VHS print. The visuals are much better, of course, in widescreen and even the story seemed better.

To be honest, though, I only recommend it for fans of of the classic film era, or for classic-era musicals. If you are used to modern-day films, this will look and sound way too corny for you.

Some other good and bad things- Cyd Charisse is a ""wow"" in any era. I just wish I could have seen her, and watch her dance, in any other decade. The 1950s, with the short hair and long dresses, have to be the most un-sexy era for women's clothes since pre-1920. I would love to see what Cyd looked like with long hair and a short skirt and demonstrating her tremendous dancing talents.

I enjoyed the lyrics to the songs, even though they were so dated I winced a few times. Sometimes they were so bad, that's what made them fun to hear. Feminists would hate those, and a lot of this movie, although Charisse's character, ""Jackie Leighton,"" is an independent woman and before her time, in that regard. Gene Kelly as ""Ted Riley"" is such an old-fashioned male chauvinist that in today's world women would cringe at some of this lines and actions in this movie.

The dancing is very good, highlighted by Kelly's roller skating/tap dancing over the streets and sidewalks. That routine ranks right with his more-famous ""Singin' In the Rain"" number.

Finally, the story the last 20 minutes or so redeems much of the earlier (see below) darker stuff, and you makes you feel good when the film ends. It's a nice message.

Earlier, the story was a downer in too many spots for a musical....until the upbeat finish. Three guys have an old Army buddies' reunion and quickly - too quickly - find out they now despise each other. None of the three are shown with many positive character traits although at least they all know their weaknesses. The dialog, in many spots, might have been the worst part of the film: totally sappy and embarrassingly dated in many areas. I was disappointed Charisse's dancing scene was just that - singular, one less-than-two-minute dance number. That was all they could include in the film? Meanwhile, Daily's loudmouth drunk scene and musical number was five minutes. I was sorry to see the guys dancing with cigarettes dangling out of their mouths, but that's the '50s. That habit, along with drinking, were often glamorized.

Overall, the last segment is so positive, so feel-good that it redeemed the film, at least to me. And - the dance numbers were definitely worth watching. If you like musicals and you haven't seen this, check it out!",1235606400,,2730,4.6397515527950315
395903,4,6301969111,"Allegedly, this was supposed to be a sort of sequel to ""On The Town"" but Frank Sinatra didn't want to do it. Plus Jules Mushin isn't in it, either, and it's 3 Army guys, not sailors.
The story is a downer. Three Army buddies promise to meet in10 years, October 11, 1955 to show Tim (the bartender) that they would always be buddies. Gene Kelly, who intends to go to law school and become a politician, gets dumped by (presumably) his girlfriend and decides to make his living as a gambler. Michael Kidd intends to open a fancy restaurant but ends up running a diner. Dan Dailey plans to go to Paris and become a painter, but ends up in the advertising business. Everyone's dreams have been shattered.
When they meet at Tim's, they find no connection. Apparently they never kept track of each other during the 10 years (with questions about marriage and kids, that seems pretty obvious) and they can't stand each other. Of course, fate intervenes but it still takes a long time for this movie to go from a total downer to at least enjoyable.
But let's face it, what does it matter what the plot is if you have Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse. It's about the dancing. Gene Kelly does a great number in roller skates. For somebody like me who can't even stand on roller skates, it's a delight to watch. Cyd Charisse does one number, with a group at the gym, but there is no pairing of Charisse and Kelly dancing.  That's a shame because I would have like to have seen it.
I would like to give a shout out to Delores Gray for her fabulous ""Midnight with Madeline"" character. Her dance number ""Thanks, But No Thanks"" seems derivative of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" but it still great.
I'd recommend it to anyone who has already seen a few Gene Kelly movies and can appreciate the dance numbers. If you are unfamiliar with Mr Kelly's  or M's Charisse's work, I suggest these movies to start with:

This musical has my most enjoyable tap dance routine of all with Gene kelly tap dancing on roller skates, now I now Fred & Ginger did a similar routine in 1937 however they did not have the sheer movement and skope that kelly had.

If however you require a plot I am afraid this musical is a little short, however it does amble along and there is a few light hearted moments especailly watch out for the cinemascope on the new DVD where you can finally enjoy the complete scenes featuring Ted (Gene Kelly), Doug (Dan Dailey), and Angie (Michael Kidd) performing their dance routines.",1164672000,3,725,4.492424242424242
395907,4,6301969111,"At last, It's Always Fair Weather is available in proper widescreen in a beautifully remastered DVD. It was worth waiting for. I've always had a lot of affection for this under-rated MGM musical. While recognizing its faults, there is quite a lot to recommend this end-of-an-era production from the great Arthur Freed MGM musical unit.

By all accounts, making the film was not a happy experience for most of the participants and some of this tension shows. But, given the fairly cynical premise of the storyline, this does not always work against the finished product. It is certainly different from the frothy concoctions of An American In Paris and Singin' In The Rain, but being different is never necessarily a bad thing. And the film seems to capture the changing mood of the times when musicals were quickly falling out of favor and television was just beginning to be a major presence in everyone's lives.

This is a Gene Kelly film and everyone else is strictly support. Being a huge Gene Kelly fan, this is not a problem for me. But even in supporting roles, the rest of the cast is pretty impressive. Cyd Charisse was seldom more gorgeous or slinky but she gets a good run for her money by the incredible Delores Gray who is both comic and sexy. Kelly has two dancing partners who have no trouble keeping up with him - tall, lanky and immensely likeable Dan Daily and short, intense and extremely talented Michael Kidd. The numbers where the three of them dance together - particularly the famous dustbin lid routine - are among the best performances by male dancers in an MGM musical. Cyd Charisse gets a fabulous solo in a boxers' gym. But, like everyone else, I really regret the lack of a Kelly/Charisse dance duet. There was really no need for that omission. But unexpected joy is to be had from Delores Gray's numbers. And, of course, the best of all is Gene Kelly's solo on rollerskates - right up there with his ""Singin' In The Rain"" number. (Some observers have commented that the lyrics to his song ""I Like Myself"" are too true to be good.)

The songs themselves are ok if not especially memorable. The Comden and Green lyrics have their usual wit and just a bit of an edge. Andre Previn's music is bright and slightly jazzy, if not the usual sort of movie musical melodies. The direction by Kelly and Stanley Donen makes clever use of the widescreen of several occasions. On this new DVD, the film looks and sounds great. I suppose all that's really missing is that elusive extra special ""oomph"" factor. But it's still a very good film - much better than some detractors would have you believe.

There are also a few nice extras on the DVD. It's Always Fair Weather is not one of the best of the MGM musicals, but it's also a long way from being the worst.",1148860800,6,2778,4.583501006036217
395908,5,6301969111,"Maybe I have a special affection because it has been so neglected over the years. I first caught it years ago in a revival theatre in New York.  When it finally was shown on TV it was pan and scanned! GOD AWFUL. Never watch the VHS of this film.  Seeing only two wonderful dancers when there are three is very frustrating.  Thank goodness for Turner Classics for showing it properly (my copy from TCM is almost always in the machine)

Can't wait for the extras.  Too bad MGM waited so long for the release.  It would have been wonderful to hear the cast and Adolph Greene do commentary. Are Michael Kidd, Cyd Charisse and Betty Compton doing any?  That would be nice.

395979,5,6301969111,"When the new DVD gets released I'll be first in line to view a copy, and I'll head for the deleted scenes, for IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER has always puzzled moviegoers, especially those who like the work of the Freed Unit, for its generally sour tone and seemingly slapdash narrative line.  Dance lovers have always wondered why Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse never get to dance together (for example), for certainly it seems like a classic definition of a missed opportunity.  Was there some original, longer version of the movie in which they shared a dance number?  Such are the dreams of a disappointed cinephile, and now, thanks to the DVD revolution we find out, yes, there was, and now perhaps we will get to see it.

The plot puzzles in other ways too.  It's set up so that, after a brief prologue set in 1945, the whole action of the movie is crowded into a 16 hour period--approximately.  The three veterans meet at Ted's Bar at noon, it takes them about an hour to get thoroughly disenchanted with each other, and then they meet again late at night for the broadcast of ""Midnight with Madeline.""  We know how Gene Kelly spends the intervening hours (canoodling with Cyd Charisse and discovering his pug is planning to throw the big fight, then running from the Mob), and we also know what Dan Dailey has been doing (getting drunk and insulting everyone at the advertising agency); but when Michael Kidd shows his face at the broadcast it's almost like we don't even recognize him, he's been absent from the movie for so long.  We know from surrounding dialogue that Dolores Gray has kept him busy all day and all evening, but it's not the same as show not tell.  Well, now we find out there's a deleted scene with Michael Kidd in it . . .  Hope it answers all my questions!

Is the movie too sour?  It was a brave move, to suggest that the realities of US 1950s had clouded the sunny optimism of 1945, and you can almost feel the filmmakers congratulating themselves for their chic pessimism; the movie has the weary glamor of Sartre and De Beuavoir sitting around Les Deux Magots wearing berets and bemoaning the atom bomb and Algerian affairs.  Is Dolores Gray too camp?  It seems to me she represents something of the horror with which American men viewed women in the media--phony, sexed-up, willing to sell their souls for a bit of evanescent popularity.  Even the runs and trills in Gray's voice, from high octave squeaks to low rumbles as of a pokey steam engine, seem totally artificial, designed to allure, to vamp, to deceive.  The movie is all about deceit--Dan Dailey deceiving himself that not going to Europe and becoming an ad man was a smart thing to do; Michael Kidd giving up his dreams of Cordon Bleu haute cuisine and opening up a burger joint (pathetically enough, called the ""Cordon Bleu"") in Schnectady, New York, a ""comical"" name milked in the movie so that every time it's pronounced the audience is expected to hoot.",1140566400,5,2948,4.618773946360153
395980,4,6301969111,"Personally this isn't my favorite Gene Kelly movie but it's still worth a watch. This was supposed to be a follow-up to the movie On The Town. Gene Kelly even wanted his original co-stars from On the Town which were Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin. The movie stars Gene Kelly, Dan Dailey, Michael Kidd, Cyd Charisse, and Dolores Gray.

The movie is about three WWII buddies that decide to meet in 10 years for a reunion. Well the date finally comes and they have nothing common. They end up fighting as well. Well Cyd Charisse comes along and as a surprise she puts them on a TV show that she works for. Dolores Gray is the host of the TV show. Then the action begins. Some of the numbers are great in this movie and they include:

March, March- This is the clip where you see the three men in their war days. Also later on in this number, they go to NYC and dance with trash can lids on their feet. A very neat number.

Why Are We Here?- This is a very funny number. All three men sing this to the tune of ""The Blue Danube Waltz."" Personal favorite!

Music Is Better Than Words- Dolores Gray sing this number as a rehersal number for her show.

Stillman's Gym- A male chorus of boxers sing this song.

Baby, You Knock Me Out- Cyd Charisse sings (really dubbed) and dances to this number! A real stand out! One of my top-favorites of the movie!

Once Upon a Time- All three men sing to this. Another favorite!

Situation Wise- Dan Dailey sings and dances to this.

I Like Myself- Gene Kelly sings this and dances on roller skates. A great number. I think you should see this movie for this number!

Thanks a Lot, But No Thanks- Another favorite! This is a real stand out! Dolores Gray sings this number and is great! It's a shame she came to Hollywood when musicals were fading because I think she would have been a big musical star on the screen!

The Time for Parting- This is the theme song of the movie really. The three men sing this when they have to go.

This really is an overlooked diamond which deserves among all others the DVD treatment for its wonderful use of 2:35:1.  There is one scene which particularly suffers from the pan and scan - the musical number in which the three pals sing and dance on a tri-split screen (each thinking the same thing about the others - `Once Upon A Time I Had Two Friends...' is the song).  Compositions are great all around, though.  Jazzy, upbeat musical numbers and some of the greatest dance steps Gene Kelly ever pulled off (the stellar one on the roller skates `I Like Myself' which is seen briefly by Jean Reno in THE PROFESSIONAL, and a great set in the beginning where the GI's tap dance with trash can lids on their feet are particularly amazing).  Cyd Charrise kicks it up with a gym full of pugs in `Baby, You Knock Me Out' and Dolores Grey for my money gives the best performance in the awesome `Thanks A Lot But No Thanks,' alternately dynamiting and gunning down her suitors...it cracks me up every time.
And the story is smart and sweet too, touching on the endurance of real friendship, the benefit of hindsight, and the healing effects of true love.  Granted, like a good horse it tends to sag a little in the middle, but it comes back kicking in the end.  This one is a real classic. I love it too much to give it less than four stars, but it loses one for the pan and scan.",1049414400,46,1583,4.460207612456747

(Luckily I have the Gene Kelly Collection on laserdisc which is letterboxed.)
It is a gritty film, that at times moves a little slowly, but the tap dancing rollerskates is truly one of the most talented things I have ever seen Kelly do-it is amazing.

395983,4,6301969111,"It is a Gene Kelly vehichle and there are three wartime buddies, but that's pretty much where the ""On The Town"" similarities end. It is a surprisingly sharp, cynical story in which the protagonist's dreams do *not* initially come true- due to life circumstances. Betty Comden and the late Adolph Green- responsible for so many great film scores as well as the scripts of ""Auntie Mame,"" ""Bells Are Ringing,"" and ""What A Way To Go-"" contribute very witty songs here, including the Danubian tri-liloquy sung by the guys and Dolores Gray's ""Thanks A Lot, But No Thanks"" and ""Music Is Better than Words (delivered with a rich, smooth contralto)."" I wish Kelly and Charisse had danced together (the omission makes the film appear a bit empty), but my favorite numbers are still his garbage-can dance through the streets and her sexy sweater-and-skirt dance with the boxers, ""Baby, You Knock Me Out."" And I would've liked the roller-skating finale better if it didn't have a big, looming, piece of the ""Singin' In The Rain"" set in the background.",1042156800,3,1039,4.875706214689266
395984,5,6301969111,"This musical, oddly neglected, is in fact a worthy companion to ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""The Bandwagon."" Gene Kelly is his usual brilliant self, and the underrated Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd almost rival him in elegant hoofing.  Not only their opening dance sequence employing garbage can tops, but also that terrific scene in a fancy restaurant where these three World War II war buddies are later reunited and privately sing of their disappointment in each other rival in wit anything in the aforementioned musicals.  Moreover, the photography in both these scenes surely ranks among the most imaginative ever put on screen in the service of that elongated band-aid, Cinemascope. Cyd Charisse, always beautiful, is here at last given something to do. Her singing and dancing scene with the boxers in Stillman's Gym shows her at her cinematic best. Dolores Gray as a TV host is wonderfully over the top, and TV itself as a new medium comes in for a wonderfully insightful drubbing remarkably early in its career as the boob tube.  Finally ,then, only one question arises - When will this film be released in widescreen on DVD?",1028160000,13,1130,4.9057591623036645
395985,5,6301969111,"Absolutely phenomenal! Gene Kelly proves once again that he was THE master at what he did. In his song and dance number ""I Like Myself"", it's a wonder he didn't break a bone! The story is fun, the songs are great, dances are awesome... what more could you ask for? Dolores Gray's character (Madeline Bradville) made me laugh at how high maintenance she is. And yet she can hit someone over the head just as good as Michael Kidd (Angie Valentine). ""Baby You Knock Me Out"" is also a great song to listen for. It's one of those fun, girls could know a lot about guy stuff too. I strongly recommend everyone who is or isn't a Gene Kelly fan to watch this. If you don't know who he is, this movie and ""Singin' in the Rain"" are a good introduction to his phenomenal dance and vocal talents. It's a shame there aren't more people like him around...",1023321600,23,841,4.329113924050633
395986,4,6301969111,"One of the last MGM musicals, ""It's Always Fair Weather"" came and went very quickly in theatres. The story of three GI's who go off to war swearing eternal friendship, only to find themselves disliking one another when they're reunited ten years later, is not so great. But when the adventures of the trio lead them to sing and dance, the movie catches fire, and it becomes a delight. Along the way, Gene Kelly, Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd perform some amazing dances (one with garbage can lids stuck to their feet) that are among the few musical numbers ever to realise the full potential of CinemaScope. Cyd Charisse is Kelly's love interest, who has an interest in boxing; she dances in a gym to ""Lady, You Knock Me Out"" with a bunch of grizzled boxers. Imitating their moves as she dances, Charisse never looked so feminine, and rarely looked so appealing.
The vastly underrated Dolores Gray is hysterically funny as an egotistical TV hostess who reunites the GI's for her show; her ""Thanks A Lot, But No Thanks"" production number has to be seen to be believed. Gray once understudied Ethel Merman, and for this reviewer's money, she was the better singer by far. Ethel's brassiness pales besides Gray's, and Gray's voice has gorgeous warm viola and cello-like notes to boot. Her ""Music Is Better Than Words"" is something any singer would be proud to have pulled off. It doesn't hurt Gray's appeal in her numbers that she looked a lot like Lana Turner.
The famous high point of the proceedings is Kelly's dance on roller skates to ""I Like Myself"".  Kelly had long wanted to do such a dance, but he wanted to dispense with the usual movie-skating tricks- wheels welded in place, wires, etc.  The number is rapturously in love with the possibilites he discovered in skating- there are long glides followed by tap-dancing followed by more glides, all without a cut, to prove that no trick work was going on.  There's even one slyly funny moment when he skates along the edge of a sidewalk, to be confronted with the obstacle of a fire hydrant.  Of course, he evades it by lifting a leg over it.
You're not going to be crazy about every second of the movie, but when everyone stops talking and the so-so plot stops for a number, you're going to feel like you got double your money's worth on this one. Fair warning- just buy it instead of renting it. It'll grow on you, and you'll find yourself watching it repeatedly- even if you do some fast-forwarding at times.",1007337600,10,2464,4.631578947368421
395987,4,6301969111,"Besides Singin' in the Rain and 7 Brides for 7 Brothers (which always get good reviews), this is a forgotten gem. I like the movie because there is some cynicism in the characters that make their transformations that much more memorable. If you don't know the basic story line, it's about 3 guys who were the BEST of friends as war buddies, decide to meet years later, and have realized that through the passage of time...now they HATE each other. Of course, it's an MGM musical, so you should know how the ending turns out.
Gene Kelly proves again that he's not only a great dancer, but a great actor, although I do believe like the other reviews that Dan Dailey does the best acting job. Michael Kidd does a good job being the simplest of the three. And don't forget the ladies, especially Cyd Charisse--I don't think she ever does anything wrong.
2 musical sequences stand out-- one is when the 3 main characters are in 3 different locations and start singing a song and the dance choreography is the same for all of them--you see 3 different screens (so they are obviously in 3 different settings) which I think was unique in the 1950's. Just an amazing sequence that makes you realize why movies are great. And the 2nd is the Gene Kelly roller skating sequence, which I feel has a bigger emotional lift considering the circumstances in the movie than his ""singin' in the rain"" bit of the movie of the same title. The movie's not as good as ""singin' in the rain"" , but if you're looking for some great musicals that they don't make anymore, I think you'll enjoy the flick.",1001203200,30,1576,4.513986013986014
395988,4,6301969111,"As I was watching this, I was struck by the idea that this was the missing link between the whimsical MGM musicals of the 50's (like The Bandwagon) and the harder-edged musicals of the 60's.  The early numbers, set on the  streets and in the bars of New York City, have a West Side Story feel to  them.  The latter part of the movie, largely a satire of advertising and  television, reminded me of How to Succeed in Business.  It takes a while  for this movie to get going, but once it does, it's almost irresistible.  Kelly, as usual, is great; Michael Kidd, in one of his fairly rare  on-screen roles, is good; Cyd Charisse and Dolores Gray are both  wonderfully sexy and funny.  But the revelation to me was Dan Dailey, who  arguably has the most complex character.  He is at the center of the  advertising satire and does the best acting in the whole movie--he does  both exhilaration and disillusioned world-weariness quite well.  This is a  movie that is better than its reputation, though don't go expecting another  Singin' in the Rain.",959126400,5,1044,4.581521739130435

7818691,5,6301969111,"Great transfer of a fine musical film!  I've long been a fan of this lesser gem, and since I first saw it on TV I've known that it must be seen in wide-screen.  Seeing it on Blu-ray, I was finally able to enjoy the whole picture.  The dance numbers are superb as usual.

Some of the reviews I've read mentioned that the visual quality is poor at a point where characters are seen leaving a bar and walking into the street at night.  I took note of this; there are two identically-shot sequences, one at the end of the opening scene and the other just as the end titles begin.  The visual quality is not the result of a poor transfer; it is because in both instances they are process shots involving matte paintings of Manhattan at night; the live action plate of the characters leaving the bar was filmed on a sound stage and added in via rear-projection, while the camera making the master shot slowly dollied back.  The result is better than an actual night-time shoot would have looked, but keeping everything in focus is nearly impossible.  For what it is, it's still a fine FX shot, and the Blu-ray transfer does it justice, even if the seams may be a little easier to spot.

On the plus side, subtitles are available throughout, so one can finally see what the words are to ""Baby, You Knock Me Out"", as well as other fast-paced dialogue.  There's also a feature that allows you to play just the musical numbers.  Speaking of which, several deleted scenes are included as extras, re-assembled as best as possible with the material that could be recovered.  Michael Kidd's ""Jack and the Space Giants"" number, in which he entertains his children while preparing food, is pretty amazing to watch, even if the audio portion is incomplete.

The Blu-ray also comes with a few extra related reels from ""Hit Parade"", as well as two animated short films.",1497916800,2,1850,4.569696969696969

7818695,3,6301969111,"This movie is historic in that it caused a permanent rift between Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen . The accompanying doco on the film is fascinating and displays what I have often heard, that Kelly was an egomaniac who, by this time was seeing his career slip away. As a result he cut two terrific numbers which can be seen and sometimes heard here, numbers that dud nothing for him, even though one was a messy duet with he and Charisse. The film itself has such a whacky confused script it surprises that it was even released. There are three great numbers and a nutty high camp number with Delores Gray who was always too big and theatrical for the screen. This film marked the last but one of the Kelly musical era at MGM, and even though Gigi, Bells Are Ringing and Molly Brown followed, this was the true end of an era at MGM. The cynical element of the film is said to have helped inspire La La Land, but very little else. Ultimately it makes me like Gene Kelly even less than I already did who was only believable playing a cad or a egomaniac or both, which seems close to the man himself.",1489104000,,1094,4.2898550724637685

7818697,4,6301969111,"Its Always Fair Weather,"" made in 1955 toward the end of MGMs Golden Age of Musicals, has an original story and some excellent musical numbers, but has never achieved the status of the studios other musicals, such as The Band Wagon and Singin in the Rain. Three G.I.s return from Europe and make a pact to reunite at Tims Bar and Grill in ten years. But their reunion is a disaster, as Doug (Dan Dailey) is an unhappy advertising man who looks down on Angie (Michael Kidd), the owner of a hamburger stand. Both of them are surprised to find that Ted (Gene Kelly) has become a gambler and boxing promoter. Ted is disillusioned, too, until he meets Jackie Leighton (Cyd Charisse), who also works in advertising as production aide on the TV show Midnight With Madeline, starring the cynical Madeline Bradville (Dolores Gray).

What makes the film unusual is that it deals with characters facing real-life issues. Its not an affectionate look through Technicolor lenses  at a world that only could exist on a Hollywood sound stage. Betty Comden and Adolph Green wrote the script, trying to re-capture the magic in their Singin in the Rain screenplay, but focused on dreams unfulfilled, disappointment, and resentment  hardly the typical subject matter of musicals. The relationship between Ted and Jackie attempts to infuse some romance into the proceedings. The film marked the last directorial collaboration between Kelly and Stanley Donen. They had previously directed On the Town and Singin in the Rain. The New York Times voted Its Always Fair Weather one of the Ten Best Films of the Year.

The film boasts some great numbers. A tour de force features Kelly, Dailey and Kidd dancing in the street, on top of a taxi, and with trash can lids on their feet as they display their joy at being back in America. I Like Myself is a solo by Kelly in which he dances through the streets of New York City on roller skates. Baby, You Knock Me Out has Cyd Charisse high stepping, backed by a gymnasium full of boxers. Dan Dailey, on loan from Twentieth Century-Fox, has a solo number in which his character is drunk, dances with a lampshade on his head, and trashes a room. Filmed in CinemaScope, the film takes advantage of the wide screen in the staging of the dance numbers. Unlike the opening of On the Town, the entire film was shot on sound stages giving the movie that studio realism so common of the period. Location filming was still a few years away.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a behind-the-scenes featurette; 3 musical number outtakes (The Binge, Jack and the Space Giants, Love Is Nothing But a Racket); 2 segments from The MGM Parade featuring Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly; 2 cartoons (Deputy Droopy, Good Will to Men); the audio-only Thought Theyd Never Leave outtake; and theatrical trailer.",1486425600,2,2813,4.767967145790554
