8468649,3,B005EM2566,"I'm a huge fan of barre classes and love Suzanne Bowen's DVDs so I thought I would enjoy these as well.  Like other reviewers, I was disappointed that it advertises itself as a 45 minute workout but only runs about 30 minutes.  However, my real issue with this video is that it is extremely poor quality.  During the opening sequences, the people in the video are backlit so you can't see their hand and feet positions.  Later, they move to the barre and their feet are out of the image.  They all where black leggings that blend in with the dark-colored barre so you have to guess whether their hips are on an angle, wonder whether you are supposed to be pointing or flexing, and assuming correct positions for your torso.  If the verbal instructions were good, this wouldn't matter so much but Carrie doesn't give adequate verbal instructions.  Since I am experienced in barre classes, I made my own decisions but I think a newcomer would potentially use very poor form and hurt themselves.  I don't think the work out was bad but I would not recommend this DVD for anyone without experience with barre.",1496188800,,1105,4.6020408163265305
8468650,2,B005EM2566,"It was barely over 30 minutes (45? huh?), it felt like half of it was stretching, it was not challenging (and I am not in amazing shape or anything), and it barely used the barre/support at all.  Slightly better than Flatirons Vol. 1, which was utterly useless, but I would say maybe only about 10 minutes of this one was worthwhile.  Choose something else.",1388966400,2,357,4.5625
8468651,4,B005EM2566,"I love pure barre classes - the workouts are challenging and have really helped define/lengthen my muscles. However, the nearest class is a 30 min drive away. So, I can only go 1-2 days/week at best. This video series is great to do in between. They are certainly not as intense as the classes (really only a 30 min workout). But they are great for after work or early in the morning - when a full 60 min regimen is just not feasible.",1366588800,3,434,4.240963855421687
8468652,5,B005EM2566,"was a bit skeptical as to how much different this would be to the bar method. It's great with the ball and i wish there were more varieties of DVDs...i'm in a location WITH NO BARRE studios, Baltimore MD. I'm 100% reliant on DVD at this point.. order order order.. good stuff!",1321574400,,276,4.326923076923077
8468653,1,B005EM2566,"As a regular Pure Barre client, I have come to love the Pure Barre workout in the studio. I bought the Flatirons: 2 DVD with the weighted ball, so I could still lift, tuck, and burn while away from the studio classes. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. The workout is only 32 mins long, not a ""45-minute full body workout"" like it claims to be. All of the sections are much shorter, and Carrie rushes through the sections. She didn't even include the last section (lying on your back and lifting your seat) as they do in the classes. I expected much, much more from Carrie and Pure Barre.",1320969600,17,573,4.415094339622642
