8271437,5,B0018Z0ISA,"Gerry with his WALK ON WATER Orchestra Newport 1979. A Dave Brubeck with Jerry Bergonzi VHS is also available from the same festival. Neither is available on DVD at the moment.

If a DVD of Mulligan's performance is ever released it might well be a expanded version. The first 9 min. of this tape is taken up by panoramas of Newport, promos for other artists, and then very brief excerpts of the Orchestra at the afternoon concert. Then the full evening concert is shown in it's entirety.

A DVD might contain both shows. the repertoire appears to be significantly different. He is shown very briefly playing soprano sax in the first set but does not play it in the full set. Also he is shown playing a few bars of I'm Getting Sentimental Over You but does not play it later - Keep a eye out for it.",1344038400,,799,4.391891891891892
