8756280,5,B01DL6PBGW,Very nostalgic. One of my favorite varietie's pack. No dislike's.,1528156800,,65,5.6
8756281,4,B01DL6PBGW,"Not the best DVD quality, since they compress quite a few titles onto each side.  But still, a good value if even half the movies are worthy of watching.",1509062400,,153,4.275862068965517
8756282,5,B01DL6PBGW,"There's a huge crime wave out there...and I just brought it to my house! This set has lots more detective and gangster movies and this time more than half are ones I don't have! On this set is even Orson Welles classic The Stranger and that one movie alone was worth the price of this entire set. Again they are also available in a digital download that is only available on a mobile device like an iPad or iPhone. This set is well worth buying for any collector of movies. To update this review, Code Of Scotland Yard, while listed on the box and sleeve of my copy of this movie set, has been replaced by a movie called Little Shop On Sly Corner. I don't know which would have been the better movie as I've never heard of Code Of Scotland Yard but this replacement movie was very good for what this cost me.",1493424000,3,808,4.219354838709678
8756283,2,B01DL6PBGW,"Okay, as the summary above shows, there are some great classics in this set. Unfortunately, absolutely no effort has gone in to touching up these films, many of which are in a very sorry state. It doesn't help the collection that a few of these (probably more than I'm aware) are available for free in the public domain, and the copies of those films available on these discs are no better (and sometimes a little worse) than the copies available from public domain websites.

No, all studios can't be the Criterion Collection, and at a sticker price of $15 for 50 movies (that's about 33 cents per film) clearly this is more about quantity over quality, but some of these films are in such a bad condition that even 33 cents is a bit of a stretch until someone remasters them. Really, you're buying this set to be able to add a bunch of these films which would easily be more expensive individually to your collection.

Just be warned that the picture can sometimes be incredibly washed out or blurry and there are some films with major sound issues.

You've been warned, but again, there are still some great films in here and in decent enough quality that the $15 price tag is pretty great.",1485388800,10,1193,4.53953488372093
