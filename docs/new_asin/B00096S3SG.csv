2268227,1,B00096S3SG,"This reveiw is more about the quality issues with the disc more so than the content of the disc. For the record ADV has added a lot of extras that is not anywhere else. Albeit many are repeated multible times on different disc of this STARBURST series release that could have been better used reducing the compression ratio. As for the quality issues, these are recorded on dual layer double sided disc and as of this writing I have had to send 3 of the 6 currently released back to be exchanged due to skipping, frame freeze, audio cracking etc. The disc were checked on 3 players and a computer and did the same on all of them. So the issue is with the quality or the lack thereof. I have contacted ADV about the quality issues and they have more the most part said ... 'Oh well.' The more pricey collection did not have these issues, but lacked many of the extras and you get what you pay for. Granted to be fair when the disc work, the video and audio quality is fine, but it is annoying to get to the middle of a show and the disc freezes up and up have to skip over 10 or more minutes to get it to play. ADV simply tried to squeeze to much into to small of a space. This collection really should have been put on 4 disc instead of 2. They did not include scene selection either, you can only choose which episode you want to see then fast forward through the tracks after that. As I said I love the show and it is a healthy 5 but this release's quality is a sickly zero.",1131408000,8,1476,4.110726643598616
2268228,5,B00096S3SG,"I only watched Farscape sporadically during its initial run on the Scifi channel, and was never much of a fan.  However, as I've started watching the series on DVD, I've really become impressed with the series.  It features a nice mix of ""arc"" and stand-alone episodes.  Moreover, the characters actually grow and change over the course of the series, something that's missing from a lot of science fiction television.

The audio and visual quality of the starburst edition is good, albeit nothing spectacular.  The 5.1 surround mix really takes advantage of the rear speakers for both the action scenes as well as ambient effects.  I have noticed that if I adjust the volume to the dialog, the sound effects are thunderous.  It reminds me more of a movie soundtrack rather than a television series.  Also, I had numerous read problems with Starburst collections 1.1 and 1.2.  So far 1.3 and 2.1 have been error free.",1123027200,,917,4.864516129032258
2268229,5,B00096S3SG,"I have to say that this is one of the most innovative shows ever.  Always complex, always something crazy and unexpected happening.  I hated Sci-fi Channel for cancelling the series... but gave them back a little credit for the Mini-series and putting Ben Browder and Claudia Black on Stargate SG-1.  Still... I'd rather have another season of this show than any other series!",1122422400,,376,4.936507936507937
2268230,5,B00096S3SG,The materials I ordered were sent in a timely manner and delivered in the condition described by the seller. I would buy from this seller again.,1122422400,,144,4.576923076923077
2268231,4,B00096S3SG,"The original run of Farscape DVDs, released by little-company-that-could ADV, were depressingly pricey and sometimes frustratingly lacking in features. Now that they've (apparently) recouped their initial investment, ADV's finally going back and doing right by this fantastic, funny, cliche-defying series. The Starburst editions boast new features and new additional commentaries by creator Rockne S. O'Bannon, showrunner David Kemper, and stars Ben Browder and Claudia Black.

For those new to the series, Browder plays lost astronaut John Crichton, stranded halfway across the galaxy after a freak accident in orbit. Hunted by the local fascist regime, he takes refuge on a living ship full of surly, fractious escaped prisoners who would probably kill one another if their survival didn't hinge on cooperation. Black is the wildcard of the bunch, an exiled soldier and ace pilot who's as emotionally fragile as she is physically tough. For all Browder's considerable acting chops and terrific comic timing, Black is the show's MVP; she kicks ass like Ellen Ripley and emotes like Emma Thompson.

This set begins Season 2, one of the best of the series' 4-year run. Despite a sometimes painfully slow start, by episode 4 the season is up and flying. As a brilliant and ruthless alien scientist named Scorpius-- one of the most magnificent bastards in TV sci-fi history-- stalks Crichton across the galaxy, our hero slowly begins to lose his mind. It all ends with a dazzlingly staged heist caper and a heartbreaking whopper of a cliffhanger.

If you've already got the old Season 2 DVDs, I'm not sure if the new features are worth shelling out more money for the same show. But for newcomers looking to get into this hugely underrated series, the Starburst Editions offer outstanding quality at an extremely good price.",1118707200,22,1822,5.21160409556314
8057635,5,B00096S3SG,All the DVDs are in great shape and all features worked fine. I have been waiting a long time to get this series and I am very happy with my purchase.,1357862400,,150,3.870967741935484
8057636,3,B00096S3SG,Farscape was an amazing show. The DVD was in good condition . the frist story skippe in one spot but other that taht it worked fine.,1272931200,,132,4.115384615384615
8057637,5,B00096S3SG,"Came in great physical condition with unbroken tabs inside, which is awesome for this hard to find season.  Great episodes and also has the original edit of the lawyer planet episode as an extra!  Also a great commentary of ""The Way We Weren't""",1240704000,,244,4.651162790697675
8057638,5,B00096S3SG,"You can tell when a show is going to do well or stink by how the second season goes.  And Farscape shot off in this one.  Crackers Don't Count and Home on the Remains are both important character driven stories, with lots of action and just plain good acting.  The 7 episodes on these DVDs are not just important to the seasons but important to the whole show that came afterwards.  If you don't get Farscape by this collection you may as well give up.",1214956800,,452,4.2823529411764705
8057639,5,B00096S3SG,"The first season of Farscape was very good, but it was the second season that really began to demonstrate the full potential of this series.  The two primary arcs that will drive the rest of the show are in full force: displaced astronaut John Crichton's (Ben Browder) great romance with emotionally brittle warrior Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black), and the evil Scorpius's (Wayne Pygram) mission to wrest the secret of wormhole technology from Crichton's brain (most notably utilizing a neural clone that is driving our hero literally insane).  Season highlights include a spectacular three-part heist episode in which a negotiation to release D'Argo's (Anthony Simcoe) son from slavery becomes a desperate attempt to rescue Crichton from Scorpius and a cliff-hanger that sees one important character apparently dead and Crichton exposed in a way that must be seen to be believed.",1210377600,,874,5.280575539568345
8057640,5,B00096S3SG,Farscape is tied with Red Dwarf and the Stargates as one of my favorite shows of all time. I love the starburst editions for their price and the considerably smaller shelf space compared to the previous release of Farscape on DVD. My one complaint is the cases are [...]. Most of the cases for the starburst collection have 1-3 disc hubs broken. I forget where but I eventually found the case manufacturer and was able to order repacements. The replacements were the exact size but the disc hubs had been greatly improved.,1178496000,3,522,4.684782608695652
8057641,4,B00096S3SG,"I started watching Farscape in Season 3. I watched all episodes and reruns I could get my hands on. I think they were INSANE to drop it from television.

I eventually bought the entire collection at once.

The only reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars, is because of the quality of the DVD. The inner clips of the box break very easily. The DVD always defaults back to subtitles between episodes, which is really annoying.

Even with the problems of the DVD, I love this set.",1175472000,,476,4.266666666666667
8057642,5,B00096S3SG,"The starburst edition has all the extras, of course. But previous starburst editions came on double-sided dvds that I had troubles with, and others did as well. But now you get four single-sided dvds that I haven't had any problems with so far. It's my favorite tv series, I've watched it several times. I guess the first season or so is a little hoky at times (which I kinda like actually). But the first and second lay a lot of groundwork for the characters that make watching the third and fourth a better experience.",1168473600,,520,4.542553191489362
8057643,5,B00096S3SG,"Farscape is one of the best sifi shows period.  I wish they got more publicity.  I heard of it and started watching it at the end of its last season.  If you like this show, and are thinking that maybe you want to buy some episodes, Only get the Starburst Edition. It has all the extras and gives you about seven shows per set at about $20US.  The boxed season sets are about twice that price, and are missing some of the cool extras from the Starburst Edition. There is also another edition out, but it has nothing for extras and is even more pricey per episode then the Boxed set.  Enjoy the maddness, with Jim Henson's best creatures since Starwars.",1146787200,2,652,4.355371900826446
8057644,5,B00096S3SG,"I have recently purchased Farscape volume 2.1 in order to fill the last hole in my Starburst Edition collection. As you probably heard, there has been many problems with the first two seasons, caused mainly by the fact that the sets contained the episodes on double sided discs. I was surprised when I received my order to find that the set I received had four single sided discs. It appears that ADV are starting to go back and rerelease the first two seasons in four disc sets instead of the defective 2 disc sets. I am not sure if the other five sets from these seasons are being rereleased as well, but I assume they will be. As far as the show itself, what can I say. It's amazing! One of the best sci fi shows ever made. I recommend this series to everyone, especially now that ADV are beginning to fix the flaws in these wonderful dvds.",1138579200,5,843,4.341772151898734
