7860908,2,6304048661,"If you know anythin about politics, and are interested in the INDIVIVUAL congresspeople that have served, than this is not the documentary for you. In by far the most shallow documentary I have seen, this movie glosses over entire eras (almost all of the 1920's, the 80's, the 90's, the late 40's), and speaks of only about 10 congressman in the 20th century. Not only that, but Ken Burns seems to want to prove that the congress is more insignificant than we think. He talks at length about Everett Dirksen, who was a senator, and spends four minutes on each decade, and RARELY goes into specific congressman. This is incredibly pithy, no Newt Gingrich, no John Nance Garner, barely any congressman. This documentary despises profiles of interesting people and love long, pedantic descriptions of buildings.",1203552000,6,808,4.992592592592593
7860909,4,6304048661,"Good Film with great insight on such Congressmen as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Jeannette Rankin, Joe Cannon, and Sam Rayburn. I do wish the film was a little longer, but that may just be me.

It would be nice if Ken Burns makes and updated version in the next few years. I also wished Senators Strom Thurmond, Fritz Hollings and Edward M. Kennedy would have been quoted and/or interviewed. The film does include Senator John C. Stennis, which is nice. Even if Burns doesn't update the film, it stands up well over time. I think many people will like the quotes from James Madison given during the early part of the film.

I hope every Congressman owns a copy of this DVD.

7860910,1,6304048661,"This DVD is just an update of a VHS from 1988 with no new information.  It is poorly made, shows nearly nothing about the history of the capital buildings, only stupid tidbits about congressional members over time.  Fails to metion the other house buildings on capital hill, or even what a representative does as a member.

Horrid video, most boring and sleepy 1:45:00.  Don't waste your money on this video, spend it on pizza and doritos for more of an education.",1096156800,5,464,4.691358024691358

7860912,5,6304048661,"Ken Burns' ""The Congress"" is a wonderful history of an essential but underrated American institution.  In only ninety minutes, Burns captures the strengths and weaknesses of our legislative branch like few  documentarians could.  Congress, often accused of gridlock and pork  barrelling, actually exemplifies the American ideal of self-rule.  This  film touches on key successes and failures of this body throughout its  entire history.  Burns examines the contributions of such pivotal  congressmen as Joe Cannon, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, George Norris and a  host of others.  Burns alters our current perspective of Congress to show  us an organization of great power that has, at times, ruled the country in  counterbalance to weak presidents.
Burns uses contemporary newspaper  accounts, archival footage, personal interviews, and journals to transform  Congress's history in a fascinating parade of men and women who represented  the best and worst of America.  A great film.",958867200,32,983,5.623287671232877
