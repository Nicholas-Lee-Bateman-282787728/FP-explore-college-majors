8564615,3,B00B9DLUDS,Waited anxiously to receive the dvd got it set it up for vewing with my family and ftiends and the dvd will not play so dissapointed and because the package has been opened i can not return for a refund very dissapointed this is the second dvd with in a few months that will not play i ordered a united kingdom with david oyello and it says cannot be played in this region so once again the package. Having been opened i could not receive a refund so disappointed in amazon o have never ever had this kind of problem before and i only order my movies from amazon so i am stuck with 2 movies that are of no use to me.and out of pocket thank you connie jordan.,1518480000,,658,4.069230769230769

8564617,1,B00B9DLUDS,My movie arrived in a timely manner however the quality was disappointing. It played all of five minutes and started to go bad with the digital skipping. Hopefully I can get another copy with better quality,1429488000,,206,4.75
