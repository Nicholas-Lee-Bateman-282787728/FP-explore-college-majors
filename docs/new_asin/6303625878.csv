693738,5,6303625878,"If you really like Fairy Tales and you know who was Bruno Bettelheim, this is a great material for you. If you are a teacher and you are giving Fairy Tales this is an incredible DVD for your course. Don't pay attention to light reviews from people who only watch Disney films. If you want three short cuts on Fairy Tales that you can interpret from a psychological perspective these are unique. I recommend the books: ""The Trails & Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood"" by Zipes, ""The European Folktale"" by Lthi and ""The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales"" by Bruno Bettelheim. With these books you will see how great these little pieces are.",1270684800,5,672,4.65546218487395
693739,4,6303625878,"I recently ordered this movie because I'm a Christina Ricci fan, and have never heard of this title. It was a strange and somewhat dark version of this classic story. Even at a younger age, Christina Ricci demonstrates her sometomes erotic, yet innocent acting skills. It is a short film, but will likely leave you wondering to yourself, ""what the heck is going on here?"".  The other stories on the video are not as interesting as Red Riding Hood, but still twisted.",1268870400,3,466,4.682926829268292
693740,2,6303625878,"I looked everywhere for this movie, all other websites rated this DVD as incredibly good... but I was really disappointed... It's nothing really incredible or eve original. Its predictable and too short even for short stories.",1265846400,,226,5.305555555555555
693741,5,6303625878,"As a fan of Christina Ricci, I was thrilled to find this DVD release of Little Red Riding Hood and Other Stories.  This disk contains three short films by David Kaplan:

Little Red Riding Hood: This is the only story that Christina appears in, but she is wonderful.  I started out just watching her, but quickly realized I was caught up in her character and I wanted to follow her through the woods to find out where this story would take her.  I have to say that her performance justifies putting her name on the cover as well as being reason enough to give this DVD a five star rating.  But there is even more to enjoy in this film.  On my first viewing, I was not so thrilled with the introduction of the wolf, played by Timour Bourtasenkov, doing some kind of interpretive dance, but he quickly impressed me with his expressive face and truly brought this wolf-like creature to life.  In subsequent viewings, this all fit together and drew me in much more than most short films do.  This film is in black and white, with no dialog - only music and narration, in a 4:3 standard (16mm) frame typical for 1997, just over 12 minutes long.  Multiple viewings recommended.

Little Suck-a-Thumb:  This film is dark and twisted.  It feels like a student film shot on a single set, and the performances are not overly convincing.  The story took me somewhere I didn't want to go, slowly and deliberately with no surprises, and when it got there I laughed out loud.  It's that strange of a story.  So it was worth watching at least once.  This film is in color, 4:3 standard frame, just over 8 minutes long.  1994.

The Frog King: It's Ringu (The Ring) meets Gonzo (The Muppets)...  Black and white, silent with title cards (music and effects), 4:3 standard frame letterboxed to 16:9, 10 minutes.  1992.

Commentary tracks are somewhat interesting, but occasionally lost in the mix.",1261440000,11,1876,4.590361445783133
693742,5,6303625878,"Little Red Riding Hood, produced by Jetlag Productions in 1995 is one of the few animated versions of this classic story that I've ever seen, in fact, the only other one I have seen was a Nippon Animation production, which was very cute, but I don't remember it too well.  This will probably not be regarded as any sort of masterpiece of animation or a film with production values that will appeal to older audiences, but for me, the film was enjoyable from beginning to end.  It is without a doubt one of the finest animated releases to come out of the Jetlag Productions studio, as opposed to rather disappointing outputs such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jungle-Book/dp/B000069HPB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jungle Book</a>&nbsp;(1996).  The character design here is really well done, and differs from what I'm accustomed to seeing from the studio.  The faces are appealing and the leading protagonist is well drawn and nicely animated, too.

Little Red Riding Hood was inspired by Charles Perrault's version of the classic fairy tale.  It tells the story of a little girl who is known as ""Little Red Riding Hood"" for she is often wearing a red hood made for her by her beloved grandmother.  One day, her grandmother is ill and Little Red Riding Hood's mother asks her to take a large basket full of eating goods to the old woman.  She warns her daughter to walk straight to her grandmother's house without stopping to play with her friends or without speaking to strangers.  Little Red Riding Hood tells her mother not to worry and soon is on her way.  On the long path to her grandmother's house, Little Red Riding Hood finds several animals in need of some sort of help and she gladly stops by to help them, but she also encounters a number of strange people she had never seen before who seem to be very curious about where she's headed to and who she's going to visit.  Little Red Riding Hood has no idea that those people are in fact the mean wolf who's lurking around in the woods, very hungry for a little girl and her grandmother to have for lunch.  Like in the classic fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood forgets her mother's advise and risks getting herself and her grandmother eaten by the wolf.  It'll take a bit of cleverness and the help of her new animal friends to save them both.

This little film was definitely a very sweet Jetlag Productions film, in fact, it is one of the few that can stand up along Diane Eskenazi's 1992 series of Golden Films animated classics.  There were very little disappointments here, I can hardly think of any at all.  The animation quality, which is usually a given let down due to being inferior, is actually pretty well carried out here, the characters move swiftly and gracefully through the scenes and the backgrounds are lovely and colorful; there's a good variety of colors, flowery landscapes and well drawn characters.  This is definitely an improvement over many of the direct-to-video sequels to come out of the famous Walt Disney studio.  The songs are neither grand nor disappointing, they may not be among the finest Jetlag songs, but they are sweet and catchy.  The opening and closing song, ""Made with Love"" is a very sweet song describing the relationship between Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother, while ""Whistle and I'll Be There"" is sweet, soft and pleasant to listen to; the last of the songs, ""We're a Team"" is a catchy tune expressing the effectiveness of teamwork and of helping out when you can.  That brings me to another highlight from this animated tale: the good messages.  It is filled, from beginning to end, with good, positive messages about helping others and lending a hand, as well as of being cautious of strangers, at the same time, showing that making strangers your friends can have good rewards, since it is implied that Little Red Riding Hood and her new animal friends were strangers prior to this cute little adventure.  I can definitely not think of anything disappointing about this production, I cannot judge the voices for I saw the film with a Castilian dub, and it makes me wonder why GoodTimes Home Entertainment has not distributed it on DVD along with the rest of Golden Films' and Jetlag Productions' films.  We should surely not expect a DVD release now that GoodTimes Entertainment is no longer and I don't know if the new Gaiam company will bother to release it, a shame really.  To wrap us up, this is definitely a good animated adventure that kids and parents can enjoy together, it is nicely done and teaches good morals.  Highly recommended!",1191024000,4,4611,4.821065989847716

1) Odd.
2) Creepy

Christina Ricci is ethereal to watch.
Like something that your brain cant quite conceptualize what your eyes are perceiving.
Although I don't always like her movies I could watch her for hours. She's just not like anyone else on the screen.",1321315200,,329,4.593220338983051
694015,1,6303625878,This DVD is real old school and cheezeball.  Bad quality because of the date it was created and doesn't even come close to anything created in the last 20 years for kids.  Very very bad dvd!  It looks as though a 10 yr old artist made this.  Characters do not talk - it is a man's voice telling the story in the background.,1308528000,2,323,4.079365079365079
694016,2,6303625878,"Wow, How disappointing.  I love fairy tales and Christina Ricci was a draw.  All Three short films 10-20 min each and seem like student projects.  Little Red Riding Hood (the longest) in Black and White with a Narrator, otherwise silent, except for the all time favorite Night on Bald Mountain as background music.  Christina was good.  The Wolf was ODD, a male ballerina dancing and prancing through the forest, an interesting artistic idea.  Ended without a final resolution and left you hanging.  The facial expressions of all three actors (Red, Wolf, and Grandma) were all good.  The wolf just seemed too gay.

For Little Suck a Thumb (the second movie) the actors were not convincing perhaps do to their advanced age.  The Villain was the best actor in this short, but that is not saying much. This film would probably earn a B- in Art School.  The ending did not seem complete.

The Frog Prince again black and white and silent was not too bad, but ended abruptly and did not make much sense.

If you are an art student studying short films these are good examples to borrow from the library.  If not, these are a waste of you money and not very entertaining.",1304553600,3,1165,4.619512195121951
694017,1,6303625878,"This review is for the first short film on the disc, Little Red Riding Hood.  I'm yet to watch the other short films.

I bought this DVD thinking it would be a real treat - I love fairy tales and Christina Ricci is one of my favourite actresses.  And when I say I love fairy tales, I'm not talking the butchered Disney versions.  My shelves are lined with the original Grimm and Perrault, and I was really looking forward to the artistic rendition this film seemed to be.

I was sadly disillusioned.  Although 16 year old Christina was endearing in her silent Lolita-esque role, the rest of the film fell flat on its face.  It tried to be artistic and sexy, but only came across as weird and stupid.  The wolf was ridiculous.  Parts of it were so bad I thought about giggling, but it wasn't even unintentionally funny enough to make me laugh.

LAME.",1299196800,3,849,4.419354838709677
694018,2,6303625878,"Naturally, the animation isn't as good as Disney's but I wasn't expecting it to be as good.  I was hoping for a kinder gentler version of Little Red Riding Hood and I was disappointed.  Just too scary for my taste.  I prefer ""Storyteller's Classics"" with Dudley Moore.",1295568000,,268,4.659574468085107

694020,5,6303625878,"(SPOILER!) Viewers who don't know the traditional variations of this story, #333 in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther index of folktale types, may think that David Kaplan has played fast and loose with ""Little Red Riding Hood.""  Actually, his short film is based on versions of the tale, including those found in rural France, in which the title character is quite capable of taking care of herself, unlike her namesake in the version by Perrault, who simply perishes with her grandmother at the end, or the Grimms' ""Little Red Cap,"" who needs to be rescued by a hunter.  Apart from its authenticity, though, this is a beautiful and often funny film.  Cristina Ricci, the Red character, is superb, but so is Timour Bourtasenkov, the ballet dancer who plays the wolf.  I can't think of a better short film to introduce to students the idea that fairy tales are not exactly what their experiences with Disney films led them to expect!",1288656000,,923,4.859872611464968

7851906,5,6303625878,"this was exciting and beautifully told. it's excellent folklore as well as superior cinema. i guess i'm going to have to say i'm a little embarrassed by anyone that doesn't easily get this. it wasn't too difficult. it was art. and very well made and expressed with skill and confidence. this has to be my favorite version of the folk legend next to Neil Jordan's exquisite 'Company of the Wolves'.
  i also thought the other companion shorts were also exceptional filmmaking. 'The frog king' was just sublime and very sensual, but i think it was 'Little Suck-a-Thumb' that just floored me with it's wit and terrifying humourous allegory of maturity. i'm sure it would scare any kid with THAT problem. or anyone with a fixation of any sort. i laughed my head off but i'm sure i'll pay with some nightmares for life.
  this is a must for anyone who loves to explore folklore or even for those who like to see it all sent up farcically. but it still has a beautiful, eerie and mysterious weird quality to it's telling.
  i found it suitable for all audiences but that is only my opinion. and it's a progressive one. some families may not be comfortable with many of the sexual suggestion here. but that is all it is. suggestion. there is nothing overt and no nudity or heavy profanity. only a naughty word uttered by a puppet kitty cat. most sensible folks can handle this.",1329436800,,1370,4.571428571428571

However, the story is perfect for first graders and up as it is not too scary.  The pictures are charming in an old fashioned sort of way. I love having my students compare different parts of the stories and this one and Jerry Pinkney's version are perfect for that as they are really quite different in many ways.",1329177600,,532,4.463917525773196
