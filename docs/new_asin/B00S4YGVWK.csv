It's difficult for me to sit still through a movie.  Not this one. I  only paused it once.",1428969600,7,256,4.25

6958457,5,B00S4YGVWK,This was a great series.  Thanks Amazon Prime!,1428710400,,46,4.75
6958458,3,B00S4YGVWK,"First, this is not part of the Lonesome Dove series you may be thinking of if you searched on that title.  However, this is not a ripoff of that name since this happened over 150 years before that series was established and the Texas church is actually called Lonesome Dove.  In fact, since that is such a unique name, it is likely the writers of the Lonesome Dove series heard that name and borrowed it.

All that aside, this is a passable western but does not have the production resources and writing of the Lonesome Dove movies.  It is faith based and does have a good moral with themes of redemption.  The action is still reasonably gritty and entertaining.  The acting can waiver at moments but didn't ruin the movie for me.

Prior to the civil war and the founding of the named church, A pastor encounters discorde in his parish over the subject of slavery which he does not support.  After an argument and the revelation that his son is wanted for a stage coach robber, he leaves his parish to find his son and bring him back to the fold.",1427932800,3,1046,4.411458333333333
6958459,1,B00S4YGVWK,"Certainly not the quality of the other ""Lonesome Dove"" movies",1427932800,,61,5.2
6958460,2,B00S4YGVWK,I give it two stars because its a western.  Movies not being made much any more.  Acting was sub-standard.  Disappointing at best.  Clearly a low budget film.  Very surprised at Berenger's acting.  Pitiful.  Almost like he was trying to act instead of acting.  Not believable at all.  It had a few good moments but very few.  Save your 3.99.,1427673600,2,341,4.627118644067797

6958475,3,B00S4YGVWK,"This is not an exciting film, but it is alright. Tom Bartender plays an overweight clergyman who goes off to preach even though his wife is dying and who does not help raise his son who becomes an outlaw. He remarries and when he hears that his son is wanted for murder, he leaves his second wife to go to find his son and help him. His goal is to build a church and preach there. He gets his son to promise that he will help him for one year.

Meanwhile the man the son robbed and who killed the people he robbed, a man who is also a preacher, is looking for Berenger's son to kill him. This second preacher made the son's love into a prostitute by feeding her heroin, and she died. This is why the son did what he did.",1479254400,,720,4.0

6958494,4,B00S4YGVWK,"Let's be honest here.  Anyone who watched this movie watched it for the same reason and it had nothing to do with the founding of the Lonesome Dove Church.  So, there's not much of a story. Mindless pablum, really. A few bullets flying half-heartedly in the general direction of Our Heroes, but no real concern that any of them would do any damage. It's not that kind of movie. So yeah. We all watched it for one thing. Greyston Holt brooding around the set with that feral, feline gait he perfected for Bitten, breaking hearts with that silk and gravel drawl. Plot or no plot, the film delivered what the audience was looking for. What more can you ask of a film?",1464480000,,664,4.434426229508197
6958495,3,B00S4YGVWK,"Decent movie. Very predictable, sometimes too slow, but okay. Definitely shows bloody scenes of gunshooting. I really like Tom Berenger and found this one below his normal good acting.

The title of the movie, LONESOME DOVE Church, is what grabbed my attention. The original Lonesome Dove series was great.",1463788800,2,306,5.244897959183674

6958521,4,B00S4YGVWK,"From the opening credits involving some beautiful scenery and a terrific opening score my hopes were that this one might be a cut above the usual video to video western made by genre lovers with some costumes and little else. Tom Berenger on the cover didn't mean much. I've seen other westerns with major stars who manage to speak an on camera line on their way to picking up their paycheck. Usually they're the only ones getting paid. Not to disparage Mr. Berenger whose performances in films as diverse as ""Someone to Watch Over Me"", ""Gettysburg"" and ""Sniper"" are excellent. So it was somewhat of a surprise to see him in almost every scene. The script is about a lot of things - revenge, redemption, the healing power of belief and being good with a cap and ball pistol. This is a faith based movie but far from being your standard Hallmark fare. There is a particular scene where Berenger is asked what he's making while whittling a piece of wood. He tells his son that Michelangelo didn't know what he was carving either. He just knew there was something in a block of marble and it was his job to get it out. And then the conversation changes to something else. The obvious is that there is a parallel to his wayward son who needs his hate chipped away to expose the good but the director and/or the script acknowledges the intelligence of the viewer by not laying it all out.
Of particular note is the photography. The movie was filmed in British Columbia and, while not really representative of Texas in 1844, is classically scenic. There was no studio work. Most of it takes place outdoors and the mist, the snow in the background and the vapor trails coming out of the actor's mouths are very real.
I thought the weakest part of the whole thing was the title. Hitch-hiking on the backs of the McMurtry books seemed a little weak. The end of the movie told me how little I knew since there has been a Lonesome Dove church in Grapevine (now Southlake) Texas since 1844. McMurtry was having coffee in Oklahoma when he looked out and saw the words ""Lonesome Dove"" pass by on the church van. Like so many other times in life, I stand corrected. And pleasantly surprised.",1454284800,3,2176,4.525380710659898
