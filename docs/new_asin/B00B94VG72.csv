5563588,5,B00B94VG72,If you like to watch action packed disaster movies all of these are great they keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see how they come out of the disaster in one piece.,1392595200,4,175,3.888888888888889
5563589,4,B00B94VG72,"This fourpal movie set is a pretty good example of sci fi technology. If you like sci fi and action, this set is a pretty good way to add to your library, and reap the bennies of enjoymnent. Thanks.

5563590,5,B00B94VG72,"Enjoyed watching some of these movies especially when there's nothing on TV, which is when I switch and watch DVDs.. They might not be the highest rated movies, but they were economical to purchase and they were entertaining  They were well packaged and arrived fast.",1374883200,6,267,4.933333333333334
5563591,5,B00B94VG72,"This excellent collection has a few features that are available seperately, and two that aren't.

""LOST CITY RAIDERS"" 90-minutes of typical SyFy Channel shlock that is horribly entertaining, with satisfactory
acting from Ian Somerholder (Vampire Diaries), James Brolin and his ship's crew and Vatican support actors.
SFX was excellent. Story is PURE Sci-Fi, better when not over-thought.
Rated R

""STORM CELL"" 92-minutes of another disaster starring Mimi Rogers and Michael Ironside (Starship Troopers).
Action-packed; entertaining.
Rated PG-13

""POLAR STORM"" 93-minutes features ""Heroes"" Jack Coleman. A piece of Comet ""Copernicus"" hits Earth and knocks it
off axis. Entertaining if you don't think too hard -- may hurt your brain.
PG-13

''QUANTUM APOCALYPSE'', at 95-minutes is the longest in TIME. This TIME it's a possible QUANTUM apocalypse.
Some ,odd, genius, ""egg-heads"" bump themselves together and come to a QUANTUM-theory solution --- with a twist,
that is suggested a few times before the climatic DeJavu [sic?] ending/beginning.

I was scared about the video quality after watching the first, grainy, preview trailer ---one of many--- but, pleasantly
PLEASED with the quality of the ten (or so) previews AND the EXCELLENT quality of all four of the features, on TWO double-
sided DVDs... which worked perfectly through my Panasonic Blu-ray player; Bose 5.1 Surround System and, on, a 55"" Sony
Bravia.

Pleasantly surprised... and pleased. Highly recommended. I already HAD two of the features, one on BR-D, but am REALLY
pleased to recommend these films... if you LIKE SyFy Channel movies, you'll LOVE these.
You cannot tell a movie by its cover, another movie I enjoyed -- I bought it because it was $5 -- I, just recently, screened.
It was REMARKABLY good in a Bulgarian Studio/SyFy-Channel/ man in a rubber-suit kind of way. With seam-less CGI, it's a
REAL shame the T=I=T=L=E kept audiences away... it's like a good '50s monster movie, with today's updated sound/video/SFX.
Excellent sets, actors, continuity, editing, DTS/5.1 sound, and only mildly fake-looking BLOOD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mosquito-Man/dp/B0007UDC94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mosquito Man</a>.
It had little touches that more-famous movies always over-look. Like shell-casings all over the place, for, but ONE example.
Dismembered body parts all over the place, blood and guts... it was great! If you like WALKING DEAD, you'll like WALKING MOS-
QUITO-MAN!
It's actually quite GOOD, with multiple monster victims, rated R, for gruesome killings and violence.... 92 minutes.",1365552000,20,2612,5.736434108527132

5563595,1,B00B94VG72,"I ordered these discs because they contained 2 movies that I did not already have. When the two discs arrived, I assumed that there were two movies on each included disc. However, each disc only contained one movie, one of which I already have. Therefore, I only truly got one movie and missed out on another that I had wanted. I watched through both discs to see if I was missing something or if the movies were somehow being combined, but I saw no evidence of the missing movies.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Film-Ultimate-Disaster-Set/dp/B00B94VG72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Film Ultimate Disaster Set</a>",1454198400,,653,5.8125
