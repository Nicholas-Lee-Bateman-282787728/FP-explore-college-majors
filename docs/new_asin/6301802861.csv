7815748,1,6301802861,THIS MOVIE IS COMPLETE TRASH. I WATCHED AT THE THEATRES IN 1980 AND DIDN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND THOUGHT IT WAS OK. I BOUGHT IT ON TAPE WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED ON VHS IN 1990. PUT IT ON MY SHELF AND NEVER WATCHED IT UNTIL I FINISHED READING THE BOOK ON NEW YEARS DAY 2009. THEN A FEW DAYS LATER I FOUND IT ON MY SHELF AFTER BEING THERE FOR 19 YEARS AND THE FILM WAS PURE TRASH. VERY UGLY. GROSS SEX SCENES. VERY OFFENSIVE TO OLDER ADULTS ESPECIALLY SINCE CARROLL BAKER WAS 49 AT THE TIME AND ANTHONY FRANCIOSA WAS 52!!! MUSIC IN IT IS BORING DISCO. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY UGLY SCENERY. I WOULD CALL THIS COMING HOME TO A SEE A BUNCH OF PIGS RUN LOOKSE IN THE HOUSE AND A WHOLE WRECK. SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT BUY IT. DONT EVEN WATCH IT. THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN THE LEGENDARY CARROLL BAKER AND ANTHONY FRANCIOSA BETTER ROLES.,1231113600,,822,4.080246913580247
