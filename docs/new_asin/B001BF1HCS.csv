We are going to show it to the Dean of our school to see if it can be introduced to the high school students (we are in elementary so this wouldn't quite be appropriate with the incentive of ""be polite to impress a potential date"") at our school.

It has very dated charm, but all the content applies for today's standards of manners. There is a compare and contrast often used in showing good manners and poor manners and how it impacts the people around you and what they think of you such as parents, strangers, teachers, siblings, friends, potential employers, and potential dates.

Especially geared towards boys rather than girls but the girls would have a good laugh and definitely give the boys the look of ""well, now you know what we expect from you"". It is important to raise expectation levels of manners as teen girls today often settle for being spoken rudely to and taken for granted.

Most of all, I loved how they demonstrated the teen lead speaking politely to his sister and showing concern for her and taking an interest in her wellbeing and happiness and respectful politeness to his parents. Most media demonstrates hatred between siblings and helps perpetuate it.

Definitely a fun short well worthy of a teacher's or parent's resource shelf.",1427241600,,1394,4.654471544715447

Although the video was produced more than 50 years ago, it still captures the attention of the teenagers nowadays. I was really surprised that my students did not find it boring. Moreover, this video is very positive in the general atmosphere. The manner of the main characters are really exemplary. I would definitely use it more often in class, and sincerely recommend it to all educators and parents.",1236729600,3,490,4.776470588235294
