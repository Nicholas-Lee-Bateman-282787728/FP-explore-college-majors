8739745,5,B017MI8GNU,"This sturdy steelbook release of David Lean's best movie after ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a real treat for collectors and fans alike.  The picture and sound quality at DTS 5.1 Surround is light years ahead of the standard dvd release that this replaces in my movie library.  While not historically accurate this movie does achieve its purpose of highlighting the insanity and needless waste that is war.  Sir Alec Guinness who originally didn't even want the part has made the role his own and I'm unable to see anyone else as Col Nicholson just as he did with Obi Wan Kenobi in ""Star Wars IV-VI"".  His was not the only standout performance though as even William Holden and Jack Hawkins both turn in masterful performances back in the day when stars could actually act and when the films actually made you think and had substance.

For those who love the movie and are happy with the one disc main course with some special features and didn't want to get the earlier release box set with postcards and all the other extras this steelbook release will likely satisfy.",1467590400,2,1064,4.668449197860962
