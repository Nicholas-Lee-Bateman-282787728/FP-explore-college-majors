2688802,5,B000KF0DKW,I was at a friend's and saw this film on the National Geographic channel.  It is a wonderful film - I recommend it highly if you can see it.,1167004800,7,140,3.8275862068965516
2688803,5,B000KF0DKW,This was a good nature film.  It was interesting watching the leopards in the wild.  There was much information that was informative.,1405728000,,133,5.0

2688805,5,B000KF0DKW,"I watched this documentary in 8-9 parts on YouTube it is well done and I do plan to buy the disc soon. Another real good one to see is ""Revealing the Leopard"" by PBS channel.",1368835200,,174,4.0
2688806,5,B000KF0DKW,My wife enjoyed the dvd very much as she is a wildlife enthusiast. Great dvd if you also enjoy good photography and scenery. Im sure she will watch it over and over and anyone else that purchases this dvd will probably do the same.,1363392000,,231,4.2727272727272725

2688808,5,B000KF0DKW,"Not even tough environmental conditions and constant danger from predators can undermine the will to live and self-motivation these animals demonstrate on a daily basis.  The simple pleasures life has to offer is grabbed with both paws as was so beautifully depicted when Lakadema plays with her kill, exquisitely narrated by Jeremy Irons `in suspended animation between cub and killer' or something to that effect.  Sad ending for Lakadema; I pray she's doing well.",1350172800,,466,5.283783783783784
2688809,5,B000KF0DKW,Great DVD! Right on time. Item as described. One of the Best documentary's i have ever seen. A must see. Narrated by Jeremy Irons outstanding voice and the leopard goes through life changing ordeals to overcome the right to live in the enviornment.,1348963200,,248,4.790697674418604
2688810,4,B000KF0DKW,Eternal Enemies more compelling and more caught on film --- not just the results of a fight between predators but the fights between predators are sometimes missing.  Could be more action.  Leopards are gorgeous and incredibly graceful.,1339891200,,236,5.351351351351352
2688811,5,B000KF0DKW,"Never has a documentary on any subject been able to so thoroughly engage viewers.  You will laugh, cry, worry, hope, fear, and - above all - be absolutely AMAZED!  The Joubert's are tremendously talented filmmakers (they've made helping Big Cats their lifes' work) -- yet Eye of the Leopard stands out from the rest of their works.

While watching, you'll actually feel you are there as a mouse in a corner watching this incredible little leopard grow up and mature with the help of his mother -- with all the inherent struggles, triumphs, learning experiences, dangers, life experiences, etc.  Incredibly entertaining.

Beautifully photographed and thoughtfully narrated.  Heartwarming, educational, thought invoking - I can go on and on.  Big Cats are both worthy and privileged to have Beverly & Dereck Joubert on their side... can't imagine a better way to shine a spotlight on the dreadful plight of these wonderous animals.",1337644800,,929,5.153333333333333
2688812,5,B000KF0DKW,"This was the most exciting and beautiful story of a leopard I have ever seen.  Since it was recorded in the wild and without coming in contact with the animal, leaving it as wild as possible, it's what I would recommend for lovers of cats...",1328832000,,241,4.355555555555555
2688813,5,B000KF0DKW,"This is a wonderful documentary done by the husband and wife team, the Jouberts, who have spent their entire adult lives, 30 years, in filming the wild places and wild animals that still inhabit them.  This documentary, funded by National Geographic, took a full three years to complete. It follows a specific Leopard cub from eight days old through three years of age. The Jouberts somehow obtain the best natural footage of animals in all their films and this one is one of the best.

There is another shorter film available on the making of this documentary. It is very interesting, but I'd recommend seeing the documentary first, as the ""making of"" tells you perhaps more of the ""story"" than you might want. The Jouberts became mere background sight and sound to the leopard they were filming, as the ""making of"" film clearly shows, but never took advantage of the leopard's wildness, and never fed it, touched it, or otherwise enocouraged it to be tame. As a result, however, they were able to get such remarkable and beautiful true events of hunting, mating, and play....

Cannot recommend this enough for those who care about these endangered species, and their wild habitat.",1324598400,,1182,4.870646766169155
2688814,5,B000KF0DKW,"If you love cats, watch this. If you don't, its still a spectacular watch.
If you can sit through a hollywood movie, you can definitely sit through the real marvels of our nature. The movie is beautifully made, great storytelling and absolutely stunning visuals. I had recently been to a bush safari in Botswana - The Buffalo Trail, through Moremi and Chobe game reserves - easily the best thing I have ever done. Seeing lions/leopard in the wild has affected me in deep unexplainable ways. This movie helped me relive some of my moments in the jungle, moments I will always cherish for the rest of my life!",1318464000,,607,4.62962962962963
2688815,5,B000KF0DKW,"Eye of the Leopard, is one of the best leopard documentaries being shown today. This story follows a lone young leopard cub named Lakadema and her mother. It follows Lakadema as she grows from a dependent cub, into a fully grown independent leopard. Lakadema is a very smart young female leopard raised by her mother. My only complaint is I wish this documentary was on Blu-ray instead of DVD. It's still a wonderful documentary on DVD, but Blu-ray would give it even more realism, because of the higher definition.

The leopard is my favorite big cat because it is more secretive. A leopard is pound for pound stronger, and even more wilder and unpredictable than a lion. This movie is very educational, and a must have for any nature enthusiast's collection. I saw a documentary on Nat Geo Wild, where a male leopard took on four lionesses, and instantly rolled unto his back, with all four paws being used as weapons to defend himself.

Leopards are the most adaptable of all the big cats, which means it's the most intelligent, and one of the smartest cats in the world. Leopards are more at home in trees than most big cats. And it can move through trees very gracefully, to escape or capture prey. Lakadema is the star of Eye of the Leopard. This documentary is full of other footage, such as Lakadema killing a Baboon, Wart Hog, Monkey, and finally an adult Impala, to become a fully independent leopardess. Eye of the Leopard is destined to become a collectors item.",1315267200,,1474,4.665384615384616
2688816,5,B000KF0DKW,"This movie is one for the ages. Leopards have always fascinated me, from their solitary existence, the almost two years they spend with their mother before moving on, to the obvious, but unmeasured range of intelligence. This documentary goes in depth into the life of a once cub Lagadema (meaning lightning from above in the local language) on her journey and transition from a cub to adult. The filming and videos achieve a level of closeness that is extremely hard when the always elusive leopard is the main subject. Stunning visuals and great chase scenes, including those where both prey and predator rarely touch the ground, are very well filmed and intricate within the web of trees and branches both use as a means of escape and cornering.

The narrator, Jeremy Irons, is very fun to listen to and I never found him boring. While the documentary does add some human attributes to the felines, they never seem foolish or fabricated, but are rather believable. The bond between mother and cub is always strong, no matter which species, and the leopards are no exception. The mother must leave her cub for days at a time in order to hunt for food to provide for Lagadema, but she must stay away in order to lessen the chances of their home being spotted. Leopards thrive on invisibility and the art of surprise, meaning they must always lurk in the shadows of their prey's minds until the moment to strike arrives.

The Jouberts once again amaze with a wonderful documentary and film. I will keep my eye out for any other videos they might be involved in, and I recommend doing the same to anyone who enjoys these kinds of movies. Well worth and deserving of the five star rating. If you are a fan of nature and the cycle it plays, this is a great video to see.

Thank you to Amazon who delivered the movie on time and in perfect condition. Great movie and great service, all around bravo to everyone involved.",1309132800,,1916,4.612903225806452
2688817,5,B000KF0DKW,"I just caught this on TV: a three year odyssey of a leopard cub growing into adulthood. It shows the ""law of the jungle"" in all it's beauty and terror. Now I'm wondering what would it be like if we classified all the different humans into the different categories of animals out there in the jungle... might actually explain quite a bit of human behavior. I hope someone makes a companion DVD to show how some people act like hyenas, lions, leopards, giraffes, gazelles, birds, monkeys  and more. Perhaps it's not all ""nurture"" as Freud and his ilk would have us believe. Perhaps a good part of our behavior is ""hard wired"" more than we think.

Terrific film. National Geographic has done it again!",1295568000,,698,4.620967741935484
2688818,5,B000KF0DKW,"This is what i call dedication, they follow the leopard from cub to adulthood and all the changes she goes through..the documentary lasts 1.5hrs and its well worth the money i spent on it. Great buy!",1292371200,,199,4.555555555555555
2688819,5,B000KF0DKW,This DVD is one of my favorite on the subject. Very well covered. It makes me want to go to Africa. I am definitely enjoying zoology.,1290816000,,133,4.153846153846154
2688820,5,B000KF0DKW,"With its locations, beautiful imagery, touching story, and narration by Jeremy Irons, Eye of the Leopard is one of the best National Geographic documentaries I have ever seen.  It's right up there with Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas, Lions of Darkness and Walking with Lions.  Legadema, ""Light From the Sky or Above,"" is one of the most beautiful animals I have ever seen in my life.  She is truly an African legend just like Ntchwaidumela, ""He Who Greets with Fire,"" the lion from Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas.  The best part for me was when she took care of a baby baboon instead of eating it, a real-life example of Isaiah 11:6.  If you are a fan of Dereck and Beverly Joubert, leopards and National Geographic documentaries, I highly recommend ""Eye of the Leopard"" to you guys.",1284422400,3,789,4.7299270072992705
2688821,5,B000KF0DKW,"I just saw this on Neo Wild last night, my Mom & I watched the most of it & I saw the whole thing, absolutely amazing!  The only Leopard fact that I know that I did not hear mentioned was that Leopards are the only big cats that actually purr (that I'd seen/heard on Animal Planet's Growing Up:Leopard) I definitely plan to own this own DVD, very enlightening!",1279065600,,360,4.294117647058823
2688822,5,B000KF0DKW,"A few days ago I tuned in National Geographic Wild to see ""EYE OF THE LEOPARD.""
What an unexpected and amazing experience!  I had never seen a ""documentary"" like
""Eye of the Leopard.""  It was really BOTH a documentary and a deeply moving
drama about a leopard presented in a way that leaves one quite breathless. Having always been fascinated by felines, both large and small, I thought I'd take a ""look"" at what Nat Geo Wild had to offer.  Little did I know what an extraordinary and moving evening I was about to have.  When it was over, I wondered ""how was it done?"" How could such a movie be made that featured one of the most elusive felines on earth?  The photography is in a class by itself!
And, Jeremy Irons, whose voice I recognized immediately, could not have been better is telling this great story as it unfolded on the screen.
Finally, this is a masterpiece that should be seen by everyone everywhere.
It shows us the awesome beauty of a world that is surely disappearing.",1274486400,13,986,4.4860335195530725
2688823,5,B000KF0DKW,"Even if you're not a big cat lover, you'll be fascinated by the level of detail provided by the authors as they film a three-year journey of Legadema, from her earliest days when she emerged from her den as an eight day old cub to her third year when she parts with her mother to set off her own journey.  I only wish that the adventures of Legadema were presented to us in chronological order as the jumps from her third year back to earlier times were sometimes confusing.  That doesn't stop me from joining every other reviewer to date in giving this program five stars.  Thank you Dereck and Beverly for giving us such a fascinating insight into the life of the leopard.  I learned a lot!",1261785600,,692,4.3828125
2688824,5,B000KF0DKW,"One of the most touching, poetic and moving documentaries I have ever seen on a feline.  Beautifully written, amazing narraration, captivating images and shots, this documentary is like a movie, delineating beautiful emotions like innate maternal instincts, grief, emotional resilience, letting go,  moving on.  I can watch it over and over again and still get choked up with tears in various scenes.  I really do believe Lagadema was a special leopard, with a very different soul than the rest.  I own many documentaries on wildlife, but nothing comes close to this one.",1249257600,,571,5.163043478260869
2688825,5,B000KF0DKW,"This was absolutely incredible. Not much in the way of extras but this program was more than fulfilling at 90 mins runtime. Basically it is the story of a young female leopard growing up with and without her guardian mom. I would say squeamish would not like this. They basically showed many types of prey being captured and the dynamics of the terrain with the interaction of other animals . Thus there were bits and pieces of other animals capturing prey as well. The limber of the leopards was just fascinating to watch. This was not hi def or blu ray , but the footage was just a tad below. Simply an awesome show and well worth the money.",1233705600,,643,4.411764705882353
2688826,5,B000KF0DKW,"This documentary is a brilliant piece of work from the world's best wildlife film makers, Derrick and Beverly Joubert.

This all comes with truly outstanding images of the cats and their background habitat. As a fan of big cat documentaries and nature programs in general, this is truly the greatest of them all to date in my humble opinion. Amazing!",1230854400,5,578,4.676470588235294
2688828,5,B000KF0DKW,"My husband and I were at Mombo Camp in Botswana.  Our guide had recommended the Eye of the Leopard to us.  It certainly did not let us down.  We were lucky to see a Leopard up close and we were in awe of her beauty.  Her cubs were being kept in a tree trunk just like shown in the video.  Now when I hear of people spending thousands of dollars to go on big game hunts I am sickened.  The animals unlike humans only kill to eat and feed their young.

2688829,5,B000KF0DKW,"Derek and Beverly Joubert are the premier African wildlife videographers of today, and their videos are invariably well researched and chock full of footage of their wildlife subjects.  Sometimes, they outdo themselves.  This is one of those times, for in this video, they tell a story perhaps even more riveting than in their previous classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Geographic-Eternal-Enemies-Lions-and-Hyenas/dp/B000J4QW72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Geographic: Eternal Enemies - Lions and Hyenas</a>.

This particular video, filmed over the course of three years, tells the story of a youthful leopard, from conception to independence.  You'll see her as a newborn cub hiding from hyenas and baboons; you'll see her facing down squirrels and learning to hunt them.  You'll learn techniques for hunting monkey and antelope by her side as her mother demonstrates.  You'll also see these leopards face down far more dangerous enemies - not only the aforementioned baboons and hyenas, but also lions, and buffalo so big even the lions are careful around them.  At times, you may fear for the life of the leopard heroine, even though you already know, from the flashback structure of the story, that she survives.

The main video is 90 minutes long, and is in 1.66:1 letterbox format.  The letterbox format means there will be a narrow black border at the top and bottom - on all four sides on a wide screen - but the amount of wasted space is minimal, unlike letterboxed 2.33:1 videos.  In addition to the main video, there is an extra feature where the Jouberts talk about how the video was made.

You won't see the Jouberts themselves - or any other people - in the main video, though.  The Jouberts prefer to keep the focus of their videos on the wildlife, not on the researchers.  Indeed, the Jouberts filmed in relatively remote Botswana in central Africa, rather than more accessible locations, to find an area that was as unspoiled as possible.  This technique really helps make it feel like the viewer is actually there, without the intervention of camera or cameraman - seeing the action through the eye of the leopard.",1210723200,2,2198,5.315028901734104
2688830,5,B000KF0DKW,"I was fortunate enough to watch this wonderful documentary on the National Geographic Channel and it stole my heart.  They aired it again a couple of months later and I was ecstatic!  I've wanted to own this work of art and finally received it as a gift last week.  It was worth the wait.  I've always loved animals, and over the years I've watched many documentaries.  I'm in heaven!  It is an intimate portrait of an elusive and majestic animal.  Very few people had the pleasure of seeing it in its natural habitat, up close and personal.  This film makes you feel like you're there.  All of your senses are awakened.  You can almost touch the leopard's fur and smell the African air.  I wholeheartedly recommend this exquisitely executed DVD.",1194307200,7,746,4.661538461538462
2688831,5,B000KF0DKW,"A masterpiece any added word is a waist.

2688836,5,B000KF0DKW,"This portrait of a three-year-old leopard is an exercise in stunning photography and brilliant narration.  Considering how elusive and secretive these big cats are by nature, the fact that the filmmakers could amass this quantity of spectacular footage and edit it into a cohesive narrative is amazing.  Jeremy Irons donates his golden voice, and his narration is appropriate in not over-anthroporphizing these animals while honoring what makes them treasurable, special and unique at the same time.

I'd recommend this DVD to the serious student of natural history as well as the casual viewer who'd like to feel taken far away to a distant and wild land for an hour and a half.  Having been to East Africa (though not Botswana, where this was shot), this DVD brings back a lot of memories.  I'd consider this superior to the excellent Nature: Chasing Big Cats, and certainly on-par with any episode of David Attenborough's Life of Mammals or Planet Earth.",1189814400,,957,5.031645569620253

I loved it so much that i bought the dvd and watch it over & over again. It is amazing to see how these leopards live such interesting lives. It's not just about survival it's about a mother & her fun loving daughter lagadema & the bond they share. Beautifully shot & narrated. I hope jeremy irons does other programs for national geographic in the near future!! This is also about how important these animals are to us.
There is another program by nat-geo that i love called ""The Secret Leopard"". It's on video, but not dvd. I hope it comes soon. Save the Leopards!!!!",1187308800,7,710,4.386363636363637

While we did not have the privilege of following a leopard for 3 years we did have the opportunity to see one of these magnificent animals.  Eye of the Leopard only served to reinforce our already profound respect for them.  Time and time again you will be astounded to see the amazing footage that the Jouberts were able to capture.  They will take you into a world that is terrifyingly violent, but somtimes extremely tender as well.  Some of the moments that they catch will certainly surprise you and may even result in some self-introspection.  While it is a documentary, it is told as story as captivating and suspenseful as any fictional piece of work.  There are numerous moments in the show that will remain with you long after you have turned off your television.  It is easily the best nature documentary that I have ever seen.  Specials like these remind us how important it is to protect and conserve what wildlife is left on this earth.  I can't recommend this DVD enough.",1171756800,32,1150,4.620689655172414
