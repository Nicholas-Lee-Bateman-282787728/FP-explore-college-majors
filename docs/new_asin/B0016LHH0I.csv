It brings back so many memories of me and the family watching this, and I'm amazed that I actually remembered some of the lines from it after not watching it for so many years. Anyone who loved this show when it was on the air, get one now before it's all gone and Doogie and Vinnie get locked in the vault with alot of other good movies and shows haha!",1281052800,,516,3.9238095238095236
8263084,1,B0016LHH0I,My review isn't for the show.  It's only for this collection.  You can buy all four seasons for about $20 cheaper if you buy them separately.  What a rip-off to those not paying attention.,1231891200,6,188,4.470588235294118
8263085,4,B0016LHH0I,"Despite the disappointing fourth season (which also seems suspiciously out of chronological order on the DVD), this show started off very strong with a mix of humour and real issues. I enjoyed most of the episodes, although the theme song for the first two seasons could send one to sleep.

Neil Patrick Harris is perfectly cast as Doogie, who begins the show as a 16-year-old doctor who struggles with his patients, friends and family. A good bit of light fun, but also provides a sliver of depth if you're after it.

5 stars for first two seasons, but I take it down to 4 stars overall.",1222560000,2,588,4.537735849056604
8263086,5,B0016LHH0I,"This is one of the greatest collections of all time, and if you are even debating purchasing this items, slap yourself.  Don't think about it, just buy it.  NPH will thank you, and then your life will be complete.",1221696000,,213,4.435897435897436
8263087,5,B0016LHH0I,"Collection arrived quickly.  Collection just sat on the shelf.  One day I had time to begin watching it and was surprised that I watched more episodes than planned.  Already almost through with the second season and sad that there are only two more seasons worth of DVDs to watch.  While the premise and novalty of a young adolescent as a medical doctor wears thin quickly, the shows are entertaining; and while coming from a more 'traditional' family-value time appears to still be contemporary.  I believe that I like this series more now than when I first saw it in my youth.",1214524800,2,578,4.683168316831683
