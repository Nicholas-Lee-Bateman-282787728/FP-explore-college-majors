8315029,4,B00006IUMQ,This video was exactly what I wanted. It is a nice quick workout for the legs when tou're pressed for time. I also do what I remember of the routine with weights when I'm at the gym pressed for time as well. I really like Tamilee's workouts in general.,1220745600,,252,4.163265306122449
8315030,5,B00006IUMQ,"I just did my 10 ab workout for the first time and I have to say it is the very first ab workout I can complete without having to rest.  You are on the go from the time it begins and nothing is  excruciatingly uncomfortable.  I have done Denise Austin's 'Hit the spot abs' workout and I have to rest in between so much that I have no desire to do it.  I am definitely keeping this one.  Besides, Tamilee's abs are cut a lot nicer than Denise's so I am positive it will work for me if I keep it up.  :)
p.s.  I am sore today from my workout which means I was doing something right.  Cannot wait to see results!!",1105315200,9,610,3.902439024390244
