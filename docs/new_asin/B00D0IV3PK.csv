5766146,5,B00D0IV3PK,"I really fell in love with this series when I watched it originally on crunchyroll with subtitles. But I prefer my anime dubbed and have enjoyed the first 7 episodes of the Aincrad arc in a new light, enjoying the art of the series without speed reading the dialogue. The price-point for this series is pretty rough at 50 bucks for only 7 episodes. As a super fan, I ponied up the money, for me it was a known quantity now with English dub. If you have never seen it, I'd suggest you head to crunchyroll or elsewhere on the internet and watch a few episodes before you buy this to see if it catches you as it did me.

Pros:
Fairly good job capturing the MMO culture.
Tight storytelling with no real filler episodes.
Story does an excellent job conveying the choices and struggles the characters go through as they decide to risk death to escape or make a life, such as it is, in a safe corner of the game.
Only slight fan services

Cons:
For some, the story might be a bit on the dark side. (when players die in the game, they die in RL and many do)
High price-point on the dvd set (over 100 dollars for the full arc when you are done)",1381104000,44,1135,4.178082191780822
5766147,5,B00D0IV3PK,"This anime had to have been written by someone that's played an MMO game. This is one fantastic anime series! It fully immerses you into the game of Sword Art Online from the first episode! Now even though this ultimately changed into a ""spoiler alert"" love story but instead of turning you off the anime then goes for the heart and makes you feel for the characters themselves! Its got action, comedy, and plenty of heart! This is a definite buy! For couples to get that spark or for dudes making an attempt to show feelings I recommend this anime!",1380758400,10,549,4.5
5766148,5,B00D0IV3PK,The series grabs your attention from episode one and keeps you going throughout the episodes on the collection. Definitely worth watching!,1380672000,17,138,5.619047619047619
5766149,4,B00D0IV3PK,"Story is all about a person named Kirito who gets stuck in an online game.  It's a game where if you are killed in the game you die in real life.  The episodes are quite interesting, but don't always seem to work in a time line fashion.  Each episode seems like a different story that just circle around the main character.  To get out of the game they have to climb all 100 floors and beat the final boss.  Which at this point seems it may take several years.  However, in each episode time seems to have jumped by a lot.

In all the show is worth watching.  If your an anime fan you should pick it up.  It's great to have in your collection.  Once you start watching, you will wanna know what will happen next or who will die...",1378684800,10,730,4.113475177304965
5766150,4,B00D0IV3PK,"I want to point out that this ""LE box set 1: ancriad part 1"" is different from the ""Vol 1"" import. It is the same part/vol 1 but is adapted for US distribution; Aniplex had a second go around to include extra goodies, and repackaged/added extras to try and give this newer release some pop. What they didn't do though, is opt for a less expensive/more bare version of the bluray, and all the fans are forced to fork over nearly $300-$400 to get this whole set in BD.

Don't get me wrong, based on naturally higher pricing for animes in the industry, this is actually a really good deal; this price range is not unusual for animes in general, and this LE offers a plethora of extras that aren't usually included in LE's at a very comparable price. My only gripe is fans are forced to go ""all in"" to own this series or settle with bare DVD (who settles for DVDs now???). That's why 1 star is missing.

This series worthy of a fancy LE, and offers a well rounded spectrum of themes. It doesn't present any particular themes in a spectacular fashion. Drama, comedy, action and romance are all in moderate doses and blend fairly well. Music, art, animation, japanese cast and color are all refreshing. It's not amazing in any single way, so don't expect it to rock your socks. It does come together nicely though, and can easily reel you in for the whole series.

Where It excels is its [however original you get get these days] story and realistic characters, which seems to be some kind of fad that went out of style years ago. I enjoyed watching the characters act as someone would in real life/a virtual game. this alone is enough to turn its mediocre points into a show that you really need to watch.

Wether it justifies the price is dependent on how deep your pockets are and how much you like anime. If you like anime, Limited Edition stuff and owning hard copies of your shows, then a could recommend a ""must buy""; you won't find this many extras bundled with a good show anywhere.

Again, I can see where Aniplex is coming from, delivering the deserving SAO in and extravagant LE like this; I'm just really sad they didn't consider a more budget friendly BD.",1378339200,7,2163,4.452020202020202
5766151,5,B00D0IV3PK,"So as the title suggest I have played several  MMO/RGP games (WOW - vanilla to current, Guild Wars 2, TOR, BSG, STO and a few other multiplayer games). I happen on to this series sometime back due to seeing a picture of Kirito and Asuna. Didn't know what it was about so I looked into this. Thought, hey cool an anime with a MMO theme....can't be all bad, Right?

Well, let me tell you. I was rather surprised that the author got 98% of MMORPG game play and machanics down packed (only a few mess-ups). I know what your thinking for those that loved this anime like I did, ""your crazy"".....Yes, I'm a gamer otaku first and anime fan second....Sorry. Sufficed to say.....I about peed my pants from all the clichs and overlaps that SAO had to my long term game play of  WOW. If you have ever played an MMO and have been a solo/guild player......well your walking in Kirito's shoe. I see the same qualities from the characters in this anime to the people I've played with and of the IRL players directly. It's so sad.....but true.

This series is a great example of what the world of MMO's is like (oh how I wish this was in practical use today......LOL). I'm not going to rehash the initial editorial review, but I will ask this....If you were trapped in a virtual game and to survive means clearing the games content, how would you react?  What would you do to survive? Could or would the game break you?

Everything IRL, happens (can/could happen) in this action/drama series. I would recommend this for any gamer and/or anime fan. The characters are lovable, realistic and down right fun. Even the antagonist is someone you could come to understand.

I initially saw this in the Japanese sub version on the net, so I wasn't to upset with the high price tag on how they are doing this series. Is the added extras worth $100? Only you can decide that. I'm sure that they will have a basic set in the future.

IMO ...this is all worth having. I don't think anyone would be disappointed in this anime.",1378252800,2,1998,4.454794520547945
5766152,5,B00D0IV3PK,"Let me start off with saying that i am a bit biased since i love sword art online.
Now, basically, when aniplex licences a series, itll come out a little expensive or completely overpriced.
When i saw the price on the official website, i was mindblown. i couldn't believe the price that they attached to just 7 episodes.
When I got the box set (after the shipping issues with aniplex) I opened it and found a great reason why it was worth 100 dollars, the extra content is amazing and the art was spectacular. I would recommend this to any fan of Sword art online, but if you're running low on the budget, the dvd is for you, the blu ray is WELL worth 100 dollars with the extra goodies and such inside, also, the dub was fantastic, but not perfect, i strongly recommend buying if you can afford.",1377302400,,796,4.348993288590604
5766153,5,B00D0IV3PK,must see Anime cant wait to get it just love it i recommend it so buy it if u can,1377216000,,81,3.1
5766154,5,B00D0IV3PK,"I love anime, all kinds. I'm 20 years old and have been watching anime since I was a kid, but recently with the decline of Naruto and the cancellation of Bleach (I love One Piece but I'm just not very far in the anime yet.) I've sort of lost interest. Then my friends started raving about this show, which was ranked best anime of 2012, might I add. So I decided to watch it, and I'm glad I did.

Without giving anything away a basic summary is that Kirito enters a new Virtual Reality - MMORPG only to find out that all 10,000 players who signed in on opening day are unable to log out. If you die in the game, you die for real and the only way the players can escape is to beat the game. It should be noted that season 1 is divided into 2 arcs. Episodes 1-14 (Aincrad) and episodes 15-25 (ALO) I'm going to speak only about Aincrad.

This set contains the first half of the Aincrad arc, and for 100$ while getting only 7 episodes is a bit steep. The set is packaged with a ton of goodies though including: A trading Card, an art book, a soundtrack and it's all pretty slick if you ask me. The menu's are pretty well done too. Of course this set features both english audio and Japanese audio for the purists out there. I haven't watched the English dub myself, but heard that it is quite good.

One nice thing to note about Sao is that the series chances paces halfway through the Aincrad Arc. There's a lot of action and a lot of focus on Kirito for a while and then halfway through Kirito sort of takes a break from all the fighting. I can't say anymore without spoiling anything but it's something I really appreciated, the nice little break before Kirito heads off towards the final confrontation. The romantic side of the show was very sweet too, and I always enjoyed those moments too (Like Kirito sleeping in a field.)

Personally, I would have bought this set just to see Kirito go berserk in glorious HD (you'll get it if you watch.) so I may not be unbiased, haha. All I can say is that if the price is a little too steep for you, get the DVD set instead. It has none of the extras this set has, but the price reflects that. This is hands down my favourite anime now, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it too.",1376611200,17,2213,4.2
5766155,5,B00D0IV3PK,So glad to finally have this in my collection. Can't wait to get the rest of the episodes. This series is the best of the best.,1376352000,,127,3.923076923076923
5766156,4,B00D0IV3PK,"Season 1 of sword art online: Aincrad is a multi-genre futuristic action/romance/comedy anime series about a teenage boy named Kazuto who gets a new cutting edge-gaming system, Nerve-Gear, where you wear a specialized helmet and become part of the gaming world, connected by nerve readers in the helmet that simulate games as if they were real life. Kazuto's first game is Aincrad. Soon after becoming part of the game and giving himself the name ""Kirito,"" he meets another gamer named Andy and while they are teaching each other tips and techniques, they find themselves being unable to log out of the game. Along with other users, they meet in the ""town square"" of their virtual world and are soon accompanied by the creator of the game, Akihiko Kayaba. He explains that they are all a part of a project that he's been working on for a while and that they will be trapped in the game until they beat all one hundred bosses. They are changed back into their original human form (exposing some fake identities) and if they die in the game, the helmet will send shock signals to their brain and they will be killed. Also, if anybody in the real world tried to disable or remove the helmet from the players head, the helmet will send shock signals as well. Kirito and Andy go their separate ways and eventually, Kitiro meets a girl user named Asuna. They work their way through the game joining and leaving clans and they gradually approach the one-hundredth boss.
I give this show a four out of five. It was an amazing story and it can definitely be changed around in the different seasons easily with new game themes. The reason I gave it a four is because the plot was kind of everywhere. Kirito and Asuna have a common goal: to beat the last boss; they kept getting off course and get involved in very trivial situations. On the other hand, the characters were really well put together and the voice actors did a spectacular job. The end of the season absolutely blew my mind and I was not expecting it at all. The other seasons definitely have a great plot and some mind-blowing scenes as well. This is an extraordinary Netflix series and I highly recommend it to not just anime fans, but sci-fi and action cans as well. Although the pricing is a a bit high, my review is simply on my experience of the product itself.",1459814400,,2321,4.555023923444976

5766159,1,B00D0IV3PK,"I absolutely LOVE this series... but I just do NOT understand why it is so damn expensive for one portion of the set. I had these on my wishlist until I had the money saved up to buy them all or even just Part 1.. but then I found where I could buy the entire first season (mind you it is NOT that long to be broken up into so many parts...) for under what one set costs here.
I paid 40 bucks for the first season and shipping.. granted it took a lil longer because where it shipped from.. but that was a small price to pay for what it should really cost",1456617600,2,554,3.8684210526315788
5766160,1,B00D0IV3PK,"This is not a review of the series itself... Which would garnish a 4.0-4.5..... This is a review of Aniplex and the fact that they are outrageously priced for a single arc of this story, and have yet to release a full series version of one of the best, most original Animes ever made. Sword Art Online merges some of the best concepts in Fantasy, Technology, and Romance and bundled it together in a complete cohesive package that is inspiring, and heroic. Yet Aniplex sees fit to only release it in parts, at a whopping 55$ a pop. This is outrageous...... I was able to secure the FULL Season 1 from an overseas Japanese Anime source located in Malaysia, Region 1, with all 24 episodes, for the bargain basement price of 29$ + S&H in a complete 2 DVD box set WITH English Dub......

5766162,5,B00D0IV3PK,"Great anime, one of my all-time favorites. I'm sure you've already read enough reviews to understand the gist of it. My biggest complaint is again the pricing. Why Aniplex, Funimation et. all price this stuff so expensively is beyond me. I understand that there's a lot of work involved on the US side with voice actors, producers, and people who do their darndest to make sure that the subtitles are accurate as possible, but just lowering the cost maybe 25 to 35% would get me to buy a lot more series that I really enjoy. I guess I'll just have to wait again for another two years again for one of my favorite series to come out in total in a dvd/blu ray combo pack. That's how I've been doing it. Making my list, and when it becomes available two, three, even four years down the road, I'll buy it then. But, no sooner. Discipline comes in very handy when it's something you really want and are willing to wait for.

I guess that I'm maybe a bit old school(nearly 39 years young and still loving anime) and love to have the dvd/blu ray series sitting on my shelf to pick out at a whim when I have time, but I find myself relying more and more on the streaming services that are available. Not really that convenient given some of the lower-cost internet providers with their cheap-ass wireless modems that I find myself replacing on an annual basis; I mean come on, this isn't Japan or most European countries that have MB transfer rates multiple times faster then 90% of the US and much more coverage then the US at half the cost. And streaming wirelessly through services such as Verizon, AT&T, et all is just too damn cost prohibitive.

If you really love the series and are willing to wait, maybe some sluggish sales on rediculously priced box sets that contain only seven episodes might catch their eye.",1448409600,,1812,4.487878787878788
5766163,5,B00D0IV3PK,This is a very good anime but is way overpriced. The money you are paying for this one DVD with a few episodes isn't worth it. Now if it was all of season 1 that be an okay price but since it's so high I would just watch it on netflix.,1448236800,,235,3.627450980392157

5766170,5,B00D0IV3PK,"Sword Art Online,aka,SAO,is a wonderful anime,with great animation,soundtrack,and storyline. For a Anime fan,I highly recommend this one. Plus,I heard a 3rd season is coming soon for the ones who finished the 2nd season!!!!:).

Sword Art Online starts off with a teenage boy named Kirito. He goes into the MMO called Sword Art Online. Kirito finds out that he can't log out of the game,unless he beats the game. Even worst,if he dies in the game,he dies in real life. Every player is frighten. Kirito teams up with Ausna,a girl around his age. The two fight to the death to escape. Everything about this Anime is eximent. Every episode gives you a huge rush because of how fun it is.

Plus,there are a bunch of cool characters in the Anime. I like Ausna,myself,because of how brave and caring she is. All the Characters stand out like bright colors,which makes this Anime even more interesting and unique. For one thing,they all work hard to get out of SAO,which shows that they believe in each other.(well,the heros).

For someone who likes action-packed Animes like Naruto,Fairy Tail,InuYasha,and Bleach,then this is a good choice. Almost every episode brings more battles,and action. This Anime also is a true adventure and fantasy Anime that totally deserves 10/10.

But,for one thing,for a adventure Anime,it's not the best choice for younger viewers. There is alot of battles.(no,not like pokemon battles,or duels from Yu-Gi-Oh! from kids Animes). I mean battles when people die and there is blood. A anime with some serious moments that younger kids won't understand. There is to much action. I recommend 10 and up.

Also,Dub or Sub? The Dub version is really good. It sounds much better then other Dubbed Animes like pokemon or Sailor Moon. The Sub version is pretty good too. Overall,if your someone who can't stand the Japanese voices,then watch it in Dub. However,if you like it in Japanese,then try it in Sub. It really doesn't matter because both are Good.

For the Anime,it is just great. Awesome story. Plus,the Manga is good too. Story 10/10 Animation 10/10 Soundtrack 9/10. Overall 10/10. Watch it. Obviously one of the greatest animes and my 3rd favorite Anime.",1438041600,3,2179,5.005524861878453

(or even less).  $80 for ALL THREE SEASONS of the show might be reasonable (if you're one of those otaku that have to have a series as soon as it comes out, instead of waiting a year or two for the price to drop), but this is price gouging at its most outrageous.

5766186,4,B00D0IV3PK,"Sword Art Online is a pretty good anime.  Not the best one ever, but it's fun, interesting, and you can root for the characters.  The virtual world element was a fun one, especially with everyone being trapped inside.  While the storytelling isn't the most original, it's still the kind that will get you to keep watching just so you can find out what happens next.  That, and the gameplay elements for the game the characters have to play would make for a fun game, if SAO were real.

I have only a couple of problems with the show.  At the beginning, the plot seemed to move too fast.  Kirito levels up too fast, characters are introduced over too short a time and then never expanded on, and there were never any NPCs shown on screen.  It's like the show wanted to get a move on so it cut out a lot of the parts that would have been there if the story flowed naturally.  The latter half of the show does better on this end.

Also, the panty-shots and shower bits were unnecessary.  It's pretty awkward when the characters are trying to investigate a murder and the perspective zooms in on a girl's butt.  I know this is a common anime thing, but it's still unnecessary.",1408233600,,1172,4.375
5766187,5,B00D0IV3PK,"I bought this product after watching the series on Netflix. The story was great and had me captivated by the end of the second episode in the first volume. I purchased this volume in tandem with the other three volumes because it's just a great series. I strongly recommend SAO, and any other anime series like it. Not to mention the product from the vendor actually arrived a day early!",1407456000,,387,4.542857142857143
5766188,5,B00D0IV3PK,"First of all: the price is insanely high for this series.  It is currently streaming on Crunchyroll for free (if you don't mind ads), or a monthly charge for the commercial free premium version.  This is how I watched the series.

The problem is that Aniplex does not have a good distribution network in the states.  When they have teamed up with Funimation, (typically for series with other studios like Bones as in Fullmetal Alchemist), they have had much better success with availability and lower pricing.  So it makes sense that they are streaming the series onto those sites.  So 7 episodes for $50 - $100 is a little extreme.

Pricing aside, the show is great.  At least the first arc!  The series is set in the 2020s when virtual reality games are coming available.  These games have headsets that immerse the player wholly in the virtual world.  Thing is, the game's creator actually gains control of the system on the first day and disables the safety programs.  Anyone that dies in the game, dies in real life.  He also disables the ability to log off and if anyone tries to forcibly remove the headsets on the other side, a tamper proof mechanism will shoot microwave radiation into the player's brain - basically killing them.

What this does is give the viewer so much more to lose when watching this.  As viewers we become invested in the characters, especially Kirito, Asuna, and Yui.  The Japanese voice acting is very good across the board.  My girlfriend has never played an MMO and I myself barely have any MMO experience, yet we were still able to enjoy the series.  It never really bogs down into a bunch of MMO tropes.  Instead, you feel like you are immersed in a fantasy world with these characters.

There is one problem I have with the show.  The story is so great and the characters so amazing, I felt it moved by rather quickly.  I would have liked more interaction, more side quest arcs, even more filler episodes.  I cannot comment on anything else because I don't want to drop any spoilers.  But let's just say the first arc is an A+ while the second arc is maybe a B.  I look forward to reading the first novel which covers the Aincrad arc (and which the series was based on).

All in all this is a terrific series.  Maybe not the best in recent years, but definitely worthy of honorable mention when discussing the best shows of the last decade or so.  And now the developers are releasing SAO II.  So more SAO for folks to enjoy!",1405987200,,2464,4.523809523809524

That's just my opinion and everyone will have their own taste.
What i can say is that if you liked any of the following you will most likely like SAO.

Claymore
Avatar Last air bender
Moribito Guardian of the Spirit
Fate Stay Night
Fate Zero
Darker Than Black
Death Note

I found SAO to be on par if not better than some of those.  It has much more romance than the others but the story line is mature and believable.  The animation is better in some ways with SOA, but overal its in the same league as the rest.",1404345600,,612,4.075

5766195,5,B00D0IV3PK,"Of one of the greatest anime series in years, ruined by greedy US publishers.

That sadly has been the downfall of SAO here in the west. Hate on Funimation all you want, but at least they do a more broad release. SAO has not gotten this. Aniplex and Rightstuf have done nothing but harm the western release. The show has been sold at mostly only one retailer for awhile and now is finally getting sold elsewhere. Prices are high and unjustified. But enough of that, lets move on to what is important.

SAO, is one of those animes you just keep forever as it becomes the benchmark for it's genre. When you have shows airing with predictable, dull stories. To then having something like SAO hit the scene, you recognize it right away.

Characters are fantastic. You won't spend the entire series dealing with dull tropes like other shows. The only real downside is, you won't get to really feel for it till about four episodes in.

This is because the story jumps a bit. A lot of exciting things do happen but the story doesn't go there often enough. If they would have lengthened out the Aincrad arc and just made it 24 episodes, it would have helped as you might find yourself confused as to why they are skipping so much story when it is so good.

So go in with the idea that you will have to leave some of the background untold. It does it's best to fill in and does a good job at it but it just could have used more episodes to fully tell. People who read the books will tell you how much you are really missing in the story that gets cut for the anime.

This isn't completely cheery and happy and the story in the anime will highlight that more. It has light moments, and then it has very dark ones. Be ready for it to get really serious as characters do die in it. But don't fret, this isn't like Geass where its just a slaughterhouse. Deaths in SAO have meaning and are used properly.

When the final credits roll, you will want more and SAO fans will tell you, read the books. The story is still ongoing and 2014 is scheduled to give us the Gungale Online arc which most fans will tell you is the best of all of them.

Great art, fantastic soundtrack, and some of the best characters in years really round SAO out to being the show to beat when it comes to it's videogame genre. The only hiccup is due to the studio skipping over parts of the Aincrad story.

Buy it when the price gets within reason. You'll be glad you did.",1394582400,4,2431,4.267391304347826
5766196,2,B00D0IV3PK,but I won't buy until it drops 2 $30 or $25 because paying $60 for only 7 ep is not worth it but I love the show,1391731200,6,112,3.185185185185185
5766197,5,B00D0IV3PK,"One of the best syfy cyberpunk anime I have watched in a while with a great fated soles love story thrown in the mix. It is a bit pricy but the extras that come with it are great, so if ur not sure check it out on YouTube before u buy.",1391126400,,235,3.627450980392157
5766198,3,B00D0IV3PK,I loved the anime but I won't buy this until the price drops into the 30$ range atleast.. Besides the current price (60$) I don't see anything wrong with this,1388188800,5,158,4.3
5766199,4,B00D0IV3PK,"Sword Art Online is one of those guilty pleasures to which you can sit down in front of, switch off your brain and just enjoy. Granted there are some fairly harrowing events in the first few episodes to which its best to be switched on for, but that aside it's a jolly good ride for the entire run.

But, ofc, anyone considering this set (along with the accompanying 3 others) already knows this. The quality of this product is fantastic in pretty much everyway. The extra context discs in each are nice and volumes I + III come with the soundtrack to the show, which in itself is pretty bloody good.

The price, however, leaves something to be desired. At $140US a pop, it's an expensive buy. I would've ordered it from Rightstuf.com, but they're strictly adhering to licensing and only shipping this to the US and Canada, so this was my only option as an Australian. Which brings me to my next point. The disc regions.

The information presented here on Amazon is that it's a Region A/1 disc (which is fine, my laptop has region switch software installed) but when the boxes arrived (parts 1, 3, 4 arrived separately to part 2, both several weeks early which was awesome) they had no region information on them. Sure enough, the collections labelled as Region A/1 on Amazon were, in fact, all region free and run without a hitch on my blu ray laptop.

So overall, very good product, high quality presentation but somewhat over priced. The region-free nature of the discs was a big plus, though.",1387584000,2,1496,4.591760299625468
5766200,5,B00D0IV3PK,Absolutely one of my favorite animes of all time. The story revolves around Kirito a solo MMO player who is trapped in the game world of SAO. You do NOT need to be a MMO player to enjoy this anime but you do get some more out of it if you are one. Though it does have some action set pieces the story is more about the characters than the action. When I was watching this on crunchyroll I had to stop at one point. There is some foreshadowing during the second half of the season that made me down right uncomfortable. I just could not keep watching week after week I needed to get it done in one sitting. It was a good call it has one of those heck yeah moments that made the discomfort I felt worth it. This anime is based on some light novels and may continue as only half of the story is covered in these 4 releases. The price for me is too high especially during X-mas. I am sure they will release a full season DVD at some point which I will snap up. If that does not happen then I will absolutely buy these.,1386201600,,1014,4.0

5766203,5,B00D0IV3PK,"Sword Art Online was touted to be the greatest experience of all time, but on the day of the launch the first 10,000 users are told by a forbodding person that they are trapped and the only way out is to beat the 100 levels of the game.  And the kicker is if they die, they would die IRL (in real life).  Kirito is a solo player Beater (one who was part of the Beta test) trying to fight his way to the top and try to save as many as he can.  Along the way he will meet an ecclectic group of people and help those he can.  But can he do it all by himself, or is there someone else in the game that compliments him and give him a reason to fight?

The first MMO game turned show that i saw was the original .dot//hack and that was so confusing that i lost interest in it quickly, so I was a little leery of wathcing this.  However when I did I took it up and enjoyed each episode from the beginning to losing friends to meeting a very entertaining blacksmith.  This is a little darker than most anime with the consequences of the system, but you watch as those inside try to make every day count and cheer them on as you hope they will make it out soon.  I definately recommend this show.",1382918400,6,1187,3.978902953586498
5766204,5,B00D0IV3PK,"There was once a time where I used to be really into anime. Cowboy Bebop, Tenchi Muyo, Dragonball Z...all the oldies! As I got older my love for it faded, and I wasn't keeping up with any new shows. Then years later, when I tried to get back into it, I was disappointed in the choices available. All of them seemed too boring, too immature, too lackluster.

Then I saw Sword Art Online and wow!

The premise is simple: a virtual reality MMO is created but of course there's a twist. All of the 10,000 people who got the first copies of the game are stuck in it. There's no log out button, no way out. And if you die in the game, you die for real! Well of course reading that summary I assumed it to be some corny, Japanese fan service mess but I was pleasantly surprised at how well scripted and enjoyable it really is. I did watch the subbed version though, prefer it that way. The main characters really have a great chemistry and I enjoyed the side story lines that came up in different episodes. The animation is great and I can already see the cosplay potential in everyone's costume! If you're not familiar with MMOS like I am, the anime really helps you understand some of the basics. In the game you can buy a house, set up a shop and can even eat and taste food. The game mimics real life very well and sometimes this plot device really drives alot of the drama in the story.  The action sequences are amazing and sometimes had me at the edge of my seat, and I actually felt like cheering the characters on! I will say I did enjoy all of it up to the last 2 episodes. The finale wasn't as great as I thought it would be and left me wanting a bit more. It just seemed so campy.

If I could recommend any anime right it would be this one. You'll definitely be hooked!",1382745600,2,1774,4.178362573099415

Why the hell would I pay this much for 7 episodes when I can shop around buy sets of 1-4 for both season and still end up getting it cheaper.  Seriously you want me to pay 119 for one anime it better have the whole damn series and any and all art work from this set and the second set I found on here.

Unfortunatly, i recently discovered that Aniplex release the series in 8 volumes (4 for season 1 and 4 for season 2). Then they charge about $60 per volume. So if you buy them here it will be $240 investment for 1 season and a $480 for both seasons. Thats without shipping costs if there are any. I cant justify paying that much for any dvd series. Thats outragous. Im deeply disappointed in how much money they are asking for because it means i cannot get them. Alot of people feel the same. They want people to buy the series and stay away from pirated copies or illegal streaming yet charge $400 or more for two seasons.

8588220,1,B00D0IV3PK,"I love the series, but here are my problems:

1) I just want the discs a la carte. There is almost no version that doesn't have all this extra stuff attached.

2) Justifying this insane price because it has all this extra stuff is BS. I do not want it. Give me just the discs.

3) Taking maybe $20 off to exclude the extra physical material, that's still about $80 for 7 EPISODES.

Here's a comparison:
-FMA Brotherhood (note that Aniplex has their name it this one too, but only one of several) on blue ray cost me $80...FOR 63 EPISODES. That's the ENTIRE SERIES. If this had at least the first season on BR (not just the first arc), I would expect it to be around $40-$50 for the 24 or so episodes (if I wanted to go on the expensive side).

So until Aniplex realizes this sells very little at this price...I will never buy this disc series (as much as it saddens me). I also suggest anybody to skip buying this and just watch it on Netflix.",1463788800,,943,4.216666666666667
