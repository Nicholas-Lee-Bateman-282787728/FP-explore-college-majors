1255812,5,B00002RAOU,"And it does so many times in this movie.  A double-murder within the first ten minutes of a movie gets the pace going in what has been called the utmost in Mario Bava's ouvre of horror movies.  Minutes after Countess Federica is murdered by her husband Filippo Donati, he himself is killed by an unknown person and his body dragged away.
Many people then come down to the bay.  There's Albert and his wife Renata, the latter being Donati's daughter.  Frank Ventura is the scheming architect who wants to turn the bay and the area into some unspecified development project.  There are also some teenagers who arrive in a yellow dune buggy and carouse in the abandoned night club by the bay.  They are murdered most foully.  It is the scene involving these people that served as the guiding inspiration for the Friday The 13th series, you know, brainless teens getting chopped up.  But they are quick and brutal, or surprising in one case.  Brunhilda, a German girl who looks like Penny Irving (House of Whipcord, Are You Being Served?) has a nice nude swim and a shocking surprise before her demise.  She's actually one of the more decent of the four.
Of the residents, entomologist Paolo Fosatti, who is too involved in his Coleoptera (that's the taxonomic order of beetles, BTW)  than in his complaining, wine-bipping, fortune-telling wife Anna, and when she was alive, Countess Federica, are opposed to turning the bay ""into a sea of cement,"" the former for the insect life, the latter for its natural beauty and serenity.  Simon, the Countess's illegitimate son, hunts squid and lives by the bay.
This movie is also known as Bay Of Blood, Carnage, The Last House On The Left Part II, Ecology Of A Crime, Reazione a Catena, and Antefatto, so take your pick, but Twitch Of The Death Nerve is the official English title.  Whatever the title, this film sports a very high body count and brutal blood flow.  Despite the cover boasting it being the uncut version, running 84 minutes, I read in one of my film books that the running time was 90 minutes, so a discrepancy there.
The only face I recognized here was Claudine Auger (Renata), who played vivacious Domino in the Bond movie Thunderball.  Here though, there is not a shred of decency or compassion in this Lady Macbeth of a woman.  Mario Bava's stylish technique on lingering on victims and blood plays a large part here, as does Stelvio Cipriani's piano score, which resembles that of the Rachmaninoff-like love theme in his first movie, Black Sunday.
It's difficult to filter out the message of human greed and also that of preserving the environment.  Simon says it best:  ""Man should live and let live and without any interference.""  When Fosatti points out that the squid he was eating was alive, Simon retorts, ""At least I eat my squid.  I don't kill as a hobby like you do.  If you kill for killing's sake, you become a monster.""",1058486400,,2892,4.698412698412699
1255813,3,B00002RAOU,"First, I must say that this film has its own place in history of horror film,but I was expecting something another. First half hour is excellent with bloody murders of the teenagers,but then you don't expects so many killers,motives,and strange music.

1255814,2,B00002RAOU,"This is one of the first gory slasher films from the early seventies, which inspired the many films of this type in the eighties. It's a tale of  a group of people after a precious land development in a bay, who kill one  another for control of it. There are some good effects from that era,  especially an axe in a face scene. The ending is surprising, and the film  generally has a unique feel to it. The DVD is below average. The picture is  not good, and the extras are just factoids on the film.

1255829,2,B00002RAOU,may have passed as a movie in 1960 but was a very hard watch,1451347200,,60,3.357142857142857
1255830,5,B00002RAOU,"Some Facts about the movie:  This movie was directed by Giallo director Mario Bava, it was produced by Giuseppe Zaccariello, the music is by Stelvio Cipriani, due to the movie low budget Mario Bava did the cinematography himself, plus many of the tracking shots had to be done on a child's wagon, the gore effects were done by Carlo Rambaldi, it came out in 1971 though it was released to U.S. movie theaters on May 3 1972, some of its alternate titles are: Twitch of the Death Nerve, Blood Bath, ""Thus do we live to be evil"", Carnage etc., finally this movie has highly influenced the American slasher and body count idea ever-present in the 1980's.  It especially highly influenced Friday the 13th close to a decade before F13 came out and it came out a couple years before Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

The simple gist for the those that are new to it is: An elderly wheelchair bound woman named Countess Federica is seized and throttle with a noose by her husband, Filippo Donati.  Donati places a supposed suicide note on a table and in a short time some unseen other killer stabs Donati and drags his corpse off to the bay.  The police just runs with the countess's death just being a suicide and somehow are never aware about Donati's death.  It isn't long before multiple murders soon ensue by one or more people that have a high desire to claim ownership of the Countess's bay property.  Our possible suspects are: Countess Federica's beautiful daughter Renata, her husband Albert, sleazy real estate agent Frank Ventura, Frank's sexy secretary and lover Laura, local fisherman Simon,  entomologist Paolo Fassati, and Paolo's psychic wife Anna.

The camera work is incredibly detailed showing the full environment outside and inside the houses.  The camera pans are intense and give way to making the movie extra scary.  The killer's first person camera perspective was one of the awesome elements of this movie that was used by several 80's slashers including Friday the 13th.  The cinematography complements of Bava, is beautiful and serene, but also gives way to a creepy element as well as a false sense of security.  The rain, blowing winds, and certain doors flying open uncontrollably are a testament to the creepy and feeling of a lack of safety element.

The sheer mystery as to who or whom the killer or killers are actually manages under the best of circumstances to keep you guessing not only the mystery behind the slayings but also why the bay property is so highly desired.  The mystery proves quite intriguing and uniquely handled.

The music is just so-so.  It's nothing special and doesn't prove scary or to offer any scary or tense elements to it.  It's not horrible however.

The characters are all very interesting and carry their own mystery and secrets about them.  The character development is fairly decent.

The movie's pace is a little slow at times, but, thankfully it's never slow for too long and keeps the plot and motives as one of its priorities.

The gore is brilliantly done for the early 70's, in that it looks remarkably real to the point of making Carlo Rambaldi a worthy predecessor to Tom Savini.  The kill scenes are brilliant including: a billhook to the throat, the same billhook to the face, a decapitation with an axe, a stabbing with a small knife, an impaling with a tribal spear, and a double homicide with the same spear going through two young people simultaneously while their having sex.  Does that last kill by chance sound familiar to anyone?

There's not very much nudity, but what you do get is definitely worth seeing.  Even better it's a skinny-dipping scene.

Overall, while this movie may be old to where it pre-dates Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Black Christmas, Halloween, and Friday the 13th, it shows a strong all around influence/inspiration, to the point of being quite the pioneer, for so many of your classic American and Canadian slashers that it's a must see just for that reason alone.  It boasts a big body count, nudity, first person perspective and creeping camera, great gore effects, great kill scenes for the most part, and a whodunit that keeps you guessing as well as a mystery over the total motives.  If you're into great slashers from America, Italy, Canada etc. than this one is not to be missed.",1447027200,13,4280,4.79291553133515

1255833,4,B00002RAOU,"This movie was equal parts maddening and fascinating as an early excursion into slasher flicks.  Maddening in that cameraman Mario Bava didn't seem to know which way was up.  Half the time the scenes were purposely just blurs (extreme close-ups that sometimes revealed a character, sometimes nothing at all).  Throughout the movie, I just wanted to scream FOCUS for pity sake!  When he did bother to keep things in focus he'd soon grow restless allowing the camera to roam freely hither and yon.  I wasn't surprised to learn that his budget was so low he had to use a child's wagon for the tracking shots!  The acting was minimal because no one was around long enough to establish their character as anything other than fodder for the axe, spear, knife, noose...............  The plot can be explained in one word: greed.  Everyone wanted this particular bay and was willing to do whatever it took to `inherit' it.  This resulted in a free for all killing spree, kill or be killed.  What this movie lacked in finesse it more than made up for in audacity.  By the end I had developed a begrudging fondness for it's clumsiness.  It took senseless killing to a whole other level.  I quite liked it.",1436832000,,1195,4.6875

Yes, ""Black Sunday"" was genuinely frightening, and he did invent the blueprint for the first ""giallo"" (""Blood and Black Lace"") and the first slasher movie, this one, ""A Bay of Blood,"" but it is just a shade from being intellectually superior to many of the directors who followed his lead.

This Kino remastered Blu-Ray looks incredible for the most part.  No visible print damage that I could see, beautiful but natural colors, and a film-like look.  Only a few sequences suffer from noticeable digital compression, but for the most part, it's a lovely looking transfer.

However, the audio is atrocious.  None of the Italian films of this period would be an audiophile's dream, but whoever mastered the audio used so much noise reduction that it sounds like a 128 kbps MP3.  Both the music and dialogue suffer as a result, and I found this incredibly distracting.  I wish reviewers would realize that sometimes a little hiss and crackle is natural in a film, and mucking up the music and making it sometimes even difficult to understand dialogue all for the sake of removing hiss is just replacing one problem with another.  This could have been a stellar release if an amateur wasn't called on to restore the audio.",1393545600,5,1111,4.651282051282052

And what they're saying is important, since it explains why all the murders are happening.  It's a proto-slasher (one of the Friday the 13ths actually appropriated one of the killings), but unlike the slasher film, the characters are killed because of the rights to an important piece of real estate (the bay of the title), not for wanting and/or having sex.  Well, except for the quartet of hippies that shows up just to raise the body count.  That and to inject some nudity into the proceedings.  (Brigitte Skay goes for a swim, finds a body, jumps out and after a moment or two finally puts on  her green velvet minidress -- a particularly unfortunate choice of wardrobe, since Ms. Skay is a big...girl, and the dress makes her look even more strapping.)  There's some nice photography (to be expected in Bava's pictures), the killings are inventive, and a mjajor plus is Stelvio Cipriani's score. He came up with an absolutely gorgeous ""Bay Theme"" that could be a reworking of a classical piece (there are echoes of Schumann and Rachmaninoff) but works nonetheless.  The only thing wrong with the score is the final cut, a hideous Euro-pop ""la-la"" number.

1255855,5,B00002RAOU,"This is more a review based on the quality of the Blu-ray than an overview of the film.  If you're a fan of slasher films or giallo horror, then this is well known as a masterpiece.  It is a giallo classic, and it is a precursor to the slasher film.  It's also one colorful, strangely motivated trip of a film.  It is also available in the 2nd Bava boxed-set, in DVD format, and as a single disc release.  As a horror film, the work is genius. Bava was a master, and this is one gory murder expose.  The kill scenes were instant classics in their time, and the film has aged as well as Bava's earlier works like the beautifully gothic Black Sunday, or the giallo masterpiece, Blood and Black Lace.  Yet, it remains incomparable to them in certain ways, and is more comparable to those he influenced including Argento and Fulci, and it's clear that his camerawork in this film helped take the stalker viewpoint into the slasher perspective, something that influenced his future counterparts in America during the late 70s and 80s slasher advance.

A summary of the film... people trespass at the wrong place at the wrong time, and the title holds true to the film, as there is a vicious and multi-seeded land dispute going on as the backstory.  Bava elevated the disturbance of the audience through dedicated violence and dread-based suspense, rather than the atmospheric suspense he relied upon in his films from the 60s.  This film was a turning point for Bava, in ways, this work really let him stretch out.

The quality of the DVD was good, a lot better than the VHS recording I grew up with.  However, when the Blu-ray came out, I knew it was one of the few films from the 70s that I was interested in purchasing.  I feel that it is only natural for a lot of people to be particular about which Blu-rays they wish to purchase, because, for many, they're upgrading from a film they might already own.  Also, some films don't transfer as well as audiences would hope, or the proper prints are not used.  This is not the case here.  The Blu-ray quality is superb.  The video is 1080P, and the bitrate is more than double the previous DVD release.  The colors are crisp, the sound is truly great- especially in the English release, even the dubs aren't poor.  The price is a little steep, but I found it on here from an independent seller and spent less than $20.  Well worth my money, also, anyone who is a Mario Bava fan probably skipped this review and already added to cart.  The Blu-ray comes with a great booklet with a superb 7 page overview of Bava, giallo, Bay of Blood etc... Also, it has an awesome, double-sided poster of both theatrical release posters (as pictured) and alternative red/black poster.

NOTE:  The English language version of the film is the version that they used for the high definition.  The original Italian version is included in the same print (I believe) as the previous DVD release, which is fine. Great film. Great artist- Bava has screenwriting and cinematography credits for Bay of Blood.  Let the blood bath begin.",1352505600,12,3054,4.580110497237569

I wrote more than 900 reviews on the German amazon page. I am also a big fan of horror trash movies of the 70s, I just say: Tenebre, Maneater, and that movie where the time runs backwards.

Just saw that classic horror movie. In faist germany its forbidden to watch the movie. so i had to drive to italy to my beloved friend to watch it. Fortunately my Italian os very good so i could understand everything. the only critical point is that every actor looks the same: they all have brown curls and they are going bald at the temples. So it took me 45 minutes to differenciate that grumpy dude from that Franco dude, who is by the way the murder *winkwink*. Why is Simone a man - I didn't understand that either.

1255860,2,B00002RAOU,"A Bay of Blood aka Twitch of the Death Nerve is something of an endurance feat that seems more interesting for its influence on the splatter movie genre (in particular the Friday the 13th series) than as a film. It's light on plot for a giallo, being little more than a collection of gruesome sudden deaths, some, like the opening murder of a woman in a wheelchair, imaginative, others less so, all related to various unpleasant characters out to control the rather grotty looking bay of the title to either redevelop it or preserve its natural beauty. The plot is largely thrown away in a series of flashbacks in the last couple of reels, but seems little more than an excuse for the killings, which are exercised with surprisingly little atmosphere: until the finale there's no real build up or suspense, just multiple murders from multiple murderers. There's also surprisingly little flair to it all, leaving a film that's not much better than the very average splatter movie. Still, at least there's some fun to be had from a duplicitous lawyer being dubbed in the American version by someone doing what sounds like a Gregory Peck impersonation.

Some of special effect's are a little dated now, but they are pulled off very well for their time (70), and this is a very stylistic murder mystery. The only reason I gave this four star's is because there are a lot of character's in the story, because of that it becomes a little disjointed and hard to follow. Also, sometime's the cinematography is a little too experimental with constant fade's, zoom-in's, zoom-out's ect., and even though I usually enjoy experimental cinematography, I thought they went a little overboard.

1255862,4,B00002RAOU,"In many ways Bay of Blood can be seen as the first slasher movie, while the years prior to the release of Bay of Blood there were other movies that inspired many slasher movies and you can even see the influence in Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace, but here with Bay of Blood there are a lot more slasher elements than most Giallos, which already have some to begin with. A lot of the clichs that would later become very common with slasher flicks are seen in Bay of Blood.

This is a very interesting Giallo where pretty much every character is some how involved with murder. There really aren't any innocent characters. But the problem is the concept while excellent it isn't really executed that entirely well. I do think Bay of Blood is a classic of the genre, but as classic as it is, it's also very flawed.

The screenplay by Mario Bava, Filippo Ottoni & Giuseppe Zaccariello is rather weak. The characters really lack any depth and it's kinda hard to tell them a part. There is actually a lot of plot here. Everybody is some how tied into the murders and it's hard to keep track of all the plot twists. Bay of Blood is a little complicated to follow. It's not that the plot is complicated it's just the writing is weak. There are many ideas, but they are sort of poorly delivered.

I'm as big a fan as you will find of Italian horror flicks, but in general it's not about the writing. I have seen many Italian horror flicks that are very well written, but normally it's about the look and murder scenes rather than a coherent plot.

As a director Mario Bava is able to keep the pace moving pretty good for the most part. Bava is a great director, but his storytelling skills might be a little weak. There is more to directing than just telling a story, granted that is the most important aspect, but there is more and Bava is able to create a great visually stunning movie with a lot of tension. While I don't think Bay of Blood is his strongest picture I do think it might be his most enjoyable.

The first half moves rather quickly with about 6 murders in a 40-minute span; but after that the pacing is a bit uneven mainly due to the amount of plot twists. Bay of Blood isn't the first Giallo, but you can see the impact this movie made on filmmakers like Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. The biggest impact Bay of Blood made was on Friday the 13th and it's first sequel. The setting is similar, plus the murder scenes are a lot a like. It's very clear where the makers of the first 2 Friday the 13th movie got their ideas from with the murder scenes.

As I stated there were other Giallos before this as well as other movies that inspired the slasher flick, but this was one of the first if not the first to feature characters we would later see in countless slasher flicks. There's a subplot involving 4 characters, two guys and two girls. They are young and looking to party, but meet rather grizzly ends.

The biggest problem with Bay of Blood is the writing; the characters lack depth and the writing wasn't strong enough for all these plot twists, and the 2nd half can have some boring moments, but as a whole Bay of Blood really is a well done movie. Despite the flaws Bay of Blood works well; this is also possibly the first body count film, visually the movie looks amazing and the kill scenes are excellent. There is some decent gore, but remember this is 1971, gore flicks were still sort of new and the Make Up F/X artists were still learning their craft, but you get a double impalement, a cleaver to the face, slit throats and even a decapitation.

The ending has been described as idiotic by some and brilliant by others. One thing I can say is the twist is something you would never see coming. As idiotic as it is, it's also really brilliant.",1195948800,3,3767,4.356125356125356
1255863,5,B00002RAOU,"Bava plays a Hitchcock like trick at the beginning of BAY OF BLOOD, using Isa Miranda precisely as Hitchcock used Janet Leigh in the first reels of PSYCHO.  Surely once you had secured the services of one of the greatest international stars of all time, you weren't going to kill her off--and so quickly!  But that is precisely Bava's strategy, and that's precisely what he does.  The gesture of this shock effect is largely lost to contemporary audiences who don't remember Isa Miranda properly, but she was still a potent force in 1971 when BAY OF BLOOD (also known as TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE) was produced.  When you kill off your biggest star within the first fifteen minutes of the movie, in an especially brutal way, you are signalling your audience that all bets are off, no one is safe, and check your preconceptions about cinema and narrative structure at the door.

A shame in a way, because the movie sure could use a lot more of Miranda, though talented actors pop up every ten minutes or so like ducks in a shooting gallery.  Isa Miranda was the great international sensation of Mussolini's Italy; even MGM got wind of her and imported her a la Garbo for a few unsuccessful American films right before the outbreak of World War II put a kibosh to her career in the States.  Back in Italy she continued in her reign as a sort of Dolores Del Rio slash Naximva tragedy Queen, with huge dollops of sex thrown in for mass appeal.  Thus in LA RONDE (1950) Max Ophuls saves her perhaps the most delectable sequence of all, larding her into a sex sandwich between boyish Gerard Philipe (the Ryan Philippe of his day!) and stalwart Jean-Louis Barrault from CHILDREN OF PARADISE.  David Lean made her the earthy manageress of the Pensione spinstery Katharine Hepburn stays at in Venice in SUMMER MADNESS (aka SUMMERTIME, 1955), using her magnificent, somewhat ravaged sensuality as a contrapuntal force, much as plain Deborah Kerr is confronted by wild Ava Gardner in John Huston's later film of NIGHT OF THE IGUANA.  In BAY OF BLOOD, which begins with Miranda's countess rolling her wheelchair moodily past window after curtained window in her chateau over the bay, a mood of desolate and painful memory is instantly set up.  It's as if she's thinking of all the ""white telephone"" movies she's ever played in, and rueing the day when her great beauty came to an end.  Bava's photography is always topnotch, but in the opening sequence of BAY OF BLOOD he puts it to memorial use; the color shimmers, the light radiates off of Miranda's hair, eyes, profile, and the wheels creak in protest as she forces them across the long gallery for one last look at her bay.",1162252800,,2666,4.673076923076923

Some of the best kills in slasher movie history, some great blood and a nice cold setting. The acting was pretty good for being an Italian movie, and the characters, at least were very well developed and easy to get along with.

[the bad]

The actual plot was good, but it really didn't interest me. It (to me) seemed like there was too much going on, and it was hard to watch the movie, enjoy the kills and think about the story. The ending was really lame, It was great how it ended, but I did not like the 2 kids... I just thought it was silly.

[final thoughts]

I remember watching this movie as a kid, and hating it. Rewatching it years later was a treat, and my opinions were almost opposite of the ones I had back then. The atmosphere in the movie is great, it reminds me of the atmosphere in the first Friday The 13th (Sean S.Cunningham got the inspiration of Friday The 13th from this film), which seems right. It is no secret that Friday The 13th was inspired from this movie, but inspiration and perhaps the setting was the only similarities that I saw. There were 3 kills in this movie that mirrored (almost exactly) kills in the Friday The 13th sequels, which was fun to watch. The kills in the movie are very well done, bloody and really nasty at times.

I thought (aside from the intricate plot) was very good, and a very solid slasher flick. A must see for the genre.",1136246400,,1399,4.320610687022901

1255867,2,B00002RAOU,"Bay of Blood (Mario Bava, 1971)

It amuses me that Mario Bava himself hated this movie. The first thing I thought after it was over was ""man, that was miles better than Black Sunday."" It's still not worth rewatching, but if you've steered clear of Bava after watching the borefest that was Black Sunday, this may entice you to at least give him another try.

The plot, what little of it there is, is this; a husband kills his wife in order to get his hands on some land that includes a private lake (the bay of the title). Her daughter stages a suicide, so she can run around uninhibited by family obligations trying to get said bay back with a couple of hired hands with less than pristine motives themselves. A bunch of partying kids happens on the scene completely by accident. Complications ensue.

It's hopelessly entangled in its own plot, despite that plot not being in any way complex. It throws in a good deal of gratuitous violence and not nearly enough gratuitous nudity (but some, at least, courtesy the lovely softcore actress Brigitte Skay), foreshadowing just about every silly slasher film to come. Basically, it's mindless fun. Dario Argento did it far better a few years later with Profondo Rosso; see that instead. **",1100131200,,1236,4.686635944700461
7916052,5,B00002RAOU,"Warning SPOILERS!!! People ask me why I review so many Italian films. I tell them it's because there are so many good, influential films that they need to see. This one influenced countless slasher films that came after it was released, many of them copying the killings verbatim (especially the FRIDAY THE 13TH franchise). This film has yet to be beaten for sheer terror and originality, nearly ten years before American horror films dared to tread the same ground (Granted, films like SAVAGE WEEKEND and THE REDEEMER [both 1976] were early adopters of this genre, but they didn't gain popularity until the '80s home video boon began). There are thirteen killings in this film and I will count them off in this review.
  The film opens with the wheelchair-bound Countess Federica (Isa Miranda; DORIAN GRAY - 1970) looking out the window of her huge lakeside mansion, a forlorn look on her face. As she is wheeling herself into another room, someone slips a noose around her neck, kicks the wheelchair away and hangs her (Killing #1). It is then revealed that the killer is her husband, Filippo (Giovanni Nuvoletti). He places a suicide note next to his wife's body and is then viciously stabbed in the back by some unknown killer (Killing #2).
  A few days later, four young adults enter the Countess' property in a dune buggy. While three of them break into the mansion for some sex and disco dancing, Brunhilde (Brigitte Skay) goes skinnydipping in the bay, gets her foot caught on a rope and dredges-up the corpse of Filippo. Before she can make it to the mansion to tell her friends about discovering the dead body, she is chased by someone, who graphically cuts her throat with a curved blade (Killing #3). Robert (Roberto Bonanni) hears a noise outside, opens the front door and has his face cleaved in two by the same curved blade (Killing #4). The killer pulls the blade out of Robert's face (surprisingly graphic and as good as anything Tom Savini has ever done) and enters one of the bedrooms, where Duke (Guido Boccaccini) and Denise (Paola Rubens) are making love. The killer runs a spear through their naked bodies, pinning them to the mattress (their death throes look like they are still humping! Killings #5 & #6). The Countess' neighbors, the always inebriated tarot card reader Anna (Laura Betti; HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON - 1970) and her eccentric husband, entomologist Paolo (Leopoldo Trieste; DON'T LOOK NOW - 1973; he keeps and insect in his pocket that he talks to!) are visited by married couple Renata (Claudine Auger; THE SUMMERTIME KILLER - 1972) and Albert (Luigi Pistilli; THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW - 1974). Renata wants to know more about her father, Filippo (They hope to inherit the Countess' millions). Paolo tells her that her father was a womanizer and Anna tells the couple that the Countess' fortune is going to Simon (Claudio Volont; VENGEANCE - 1968), who is her illegitimate son. This news doesn't sit too well with Renata or Albert, so they go and see fisherman Simon by the dock on the bay (and, no, he isn't sitting!). While they are talking to him, they find her father's dead body in Simon's boat (his face is engulfed by a live squid, which is very unnerving!). He tells them that he found the body floating in the lake. Renata gets sick, so she goes to the mansion to wash her face in a bathroom, where she discovers the mutilated bodies of the four young adults. Suddenly, caretaker Frank Ventura (Chris Avram; THE SLASHER...IS THE SEX MANIAC! - 1972) appears, hatchet in hand, and he chases Renata, forcing her to grab a pair of scissors and stabbing him by thrusting her hand through a glass door. Albert checks up on his wife and sees Paolo running out the door. Renata explains to Albert what she has done and tells him he must kill Paolo before he calls the police. Albert strangles Paolo as he is on the phone (Killing #7) and when Anna sees Frank's body, someone lops her head off with the hatchet (Killing #8). Renata then tells Albert that she killed Anna and that they must get rid of Simon so they can inherit the fortune. It turns out Frank is not dead and he tells his wife Laura (Anna Maria Rosati) to go get Simon. Simon accuses Laura of killing Filippo, but she tells him that Frank killed him.
  A flashback ensues, where we find out what actually happened to Countess Federica on that fateful night. Frank and Laura wanted to buy the bay and the area surrounding it, but the Countess refused because Frank wanted to industrialize the area, ruining its natural beauty. Laura became Filippo's mistress, using sex as a way to get him to kill his wife. The rest is history. When Laura tells Simon the story, he strangles her with his bare hands (Killing #9). This triggers another flashback which shows us that Frank paid Simon to kill his wife (These people are despicable!). Back in the present, Albert kills Simon by impaling him with his own fishing spear, pinning him to a wall (Killing #10). Frank tries to kill Albert, but he gets the upper hand, killing Frank instead (Killing #11). This triggers a fast-forward, where we see Frank and Renata standing outside, Frank burning the Countess' will, thereby letting them inherit her fortune. What they don't see in all their giddiness is someone pointing a shotgun at them. We hear, ""Daddy!"" and the sound of a shotgun blast, Albert and Renata's lifeless bodies lying on the ground (Killings #12 & #13). The shooter? Their young son, who turns to his little sister and says, ""Mommy and Daddy are sure good at playing dead!"" Kids. You can't live with them and you sure can't kill them!
  This atmospheric film was directed and co-written by Italy's master of the macabre, Mario Bava (PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES - 1965; 5 DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON - 1970; BARON BLOOD - 1972; RABID DOGS - 1974). Bava was also a master with the camera (he also was cinematographer on this film), knowing how to turn the most ordinary things into something creepy and dangerous (He does it here with squids. I know he is trying to get squids to represent a symbol of something deplorable, but they just come off as creepy. I have no idea why some people eat them. I guarantee they wouldn't be if they watched this film!). What amazes me is that Bava didn't get the recognition he so richly deserved until after his death (in 1980). People now know that he was a genius with a camera and was way ahead of his time, as most of his films still hold up today, Originally filmed as REAZIONE A CATENA (""Chain Reaction"") and later known as ECOLOGIA DEL DELITTO (""Ecology Of A Crime""), this film pre-dated most of the slasher films that flooded U.S. theaters and home video from the '80s right up to this day.
  Released theatrically in the U.S. by Hallmark Releasing under the titles CARNAGE and TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE (which is how I originally saw it on a double feature with an edited version of Amando Ossorio's TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD [1972]). Hallmark later released it under the ridiculous title of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT PART II. It was released on fullscreen VHS by Gorgon Video (under the review title) and on VHS in England under the title BLOOD BATH. It also received a widescreen VHS & DVD release early in the New Millennium courtesy of Image Entertainment (both a long OOP). But it's the Blu-Ray, from Kino Lorber, that you should buy. While it is short on extras (just some trailers for other Bava films that are on Kino's roster), it contains the U.S theatrical version (in Italian or English dubbed. For once, the English dub is not intrusive, as most of the actors are speaking English) and the alternate European release (in Italian with optional English subtitles) which adds more exposition to the film. Both versions look absolutely marvelous and show-off Bava's mastery behind the camera. Be sure to listen carefully in the beginning of the film to learn what a ""squonk"" is. Frank's description is a good reference to how all of the people in this film behave. I consider this a masterpiece of Italian horror. The soundtrack, by Stelvio Cipriani (CITY OF THE WALKING DEAD - 1980, and nearly 240 other Italian films!), is also very memorable. Also featuring Renato Cesti &  Nicoletta Elmi as Renata and Albert's young son and daughter. The theatrical version is Rated R. The European version is Not Rated.",1525392000,,8320,4.683994528043776

The transfer/remaster is ok, not stellar... there is still some dirt/dust which shows up as little white flecks throughout a lot of the film. I would think they'd clean that up frame by frame but no, so it's not an extensive/expensive remaster but viewable. Bava is a great cinematographer and the movie is shot well, inventive shots, angles etc. Bava movies do not however have the best plots and this movie is hard to follow what the hell is going on with flash backs only adding to the confusion after the facts/homicides. I found myself confused many times and rewatched this movie attempting to make sense of it all only to come away unsatisfied with the corny dark humor ending which makes it all a wash regarding plot sensibilities. Many of Bava's movies feature a cheap plot aspect like Scooby Doo's ""if it wasn't for you meddling kids... I wouldn't have had to kill, and kill again and again, you infernal meddling kids!"" thus the main impetus for the slasher killing in his movies.

Bava excels in cinematography but his movies are hampered by bad writing/plots whereas Argento's movies typically have better plots but Argento himself wasn't a cinematographer and his movies relied on the quality of his partnerships with cinematographers etc.

The soundtrack is also a weak point consisting of vary little other than intermittent bongo music which makes the movie drag on painfully. Overall this movie is ok for a laugh, some of the deaths might have been shocking and unique for that time foreshadowing many of the copy cat flicks in the US like Friday the 13th movies and others. There just isn't strong enough plot and character development or recognition leaving one wondering who to care for, if there's even a protagonist at all.

Mario invented the slasher, but it was not with Blood And Black Lace, the first colour Giallo, it was with this movie, filmed in Lazio in October and November 1970. If you look at the weapons used in BABL(strangling, puncturing, burning, asphyxiation, drowning and shooting) and the way they are used, it was never intended to be a slasher. Here though in 1971 Bava runs through the whole gamut of slasher deaths with aplomb. The pacing and the tension are particularly brilliant, and his compromising style of Directing works dividends with the acting. The use here of subjective camera is also an original in the way it is used, and the movie industry owes so much to Bava and this film despite one not totally convincing effect.
