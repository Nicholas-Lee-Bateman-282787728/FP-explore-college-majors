2646105,4,B000HWZ4DO,"As always, the extras included on a DVD are what determine its value. The Animaniacs DVDs are no exception, with a ""writers' discussion of their favorite scripts"", revealing much about the creative process of the series; sad to say the consensus of those interviewed is that it is unlikely that writers will ever again have the freedom they did  on Animaniacs, and it is also unlikely that we will ever again hear the lush music in an animated film as we did here.  For people interested in animation, but unfamiliar with the characters viewing these discs will prove most rewarding; for people who know the series there will be questions as to why a favorite episode was omitted, in my case, where's L.A. Dot?",1169337600,2,710,4.717741935483871
2646106,5,B000HWZ4DO,"Liked seeing these on a rare holiday or sick day, and wanted to share them with my wife (she reminds me of Dot), she likes them!  Got to see much of the series on broadcast TV (WB KTLA) every afternoon '94/95, but Volume 1 & 2 both had stuff I'd not seen.  Had forgotten how much music there was, not just zany stuff.  Was always a fan of Daffy Duck, Bugs, Roadrunner, Taz, so really enjoyed these.  Used to Like cartoons before a movie, became aware of movie stars before my time because they were in old cartoons, one of these follows that tradition.  Bill Clinton plays the Sax.  Had forgotten Minerva Mink (Hellooooo Nurse) but did remember the teen girl 'toons I haven't gotten to yet.  Liked the Rita and dog, the kid, ""I love you lady, bye bye"".  These are just fun, have to watch more than once to catch some things.  Fun to watch as adult, or with a Grandkid (if you have one).  These are perfect for some fun TV without a big commitment, bite off 22-24 mins at a time per show with your favorite watertower scenes, and Dr. Scratch N Sniff. I'm really glad to have Vol 1 & 2.  Like visiting a good friend. - tomcat bluepuma",1168819200,3,1132,4.242990654205608
2646107,5,B000HWZ4DO,"I used to secretly watch this show as a teenager. It's great to see it released on DVD! Now, if only they would release Star Warners....",1168300800,,136,4.269230769230769
2646108,5,B000HWZ4DO,"This could be the ultimate acheviment in cartoons. Might be the best writing ever, and it is very funny for both children and adults.

 Like Shakespeare, Animaniacs can be enjoyed on many levels.

 Some of the humor will be over the heads of most childern.

  If you are looking for funny and smart, for all age groups, this is it.",1168300800,,331,4.416666666666667
2646109,3,B000HWZ4DO,"Well we've enjoyed the shows, the folks at Warners dropped the ball on transfer quailty. The prints are dirty in places. And sometimes you get these odd ghost images during motion. For a show that's barely a decade old, it looks ancient.",1167868800,5,237,4.666666666666667
2646110,5,B000HWZ4DO,"This is it.  The second volume of Speilberg's acclaimed animated series ""Animaniacs"" featuring an overload of original characters and episodes to keep you laughin' till next week.  If you haven't lived during the past decade, that is to say you've never even heard of ""Animaniacs"", you really don't know what you're missing.  By the way, there seems to be a few characters I seem to have missed from the volume 1 review, which are:

Minerva Mink: Like Hello Nurse, no man - or man-beast - can resist her exquisite beauty, that is unless she meets the guy of her dreams.

Chicken Boo: A six-foot chicken who claims to be a master of disguise, but he really isn't.

Randy Beaman: At times this weird little boy tells the weirdest of stories.

Katie Kaboom: She's your average teenage girl with a not-so-average problem.

Mr. Skullhead: An odd bone-faced fellow who stars in a huge number of shorts entitled ""Good Idea, Bad Idea"".  It wasn't long until he had his very own episode, which is in this volume.

Besides the actual episodes, there are a ton of various other shorts starring the Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister and friends, such as ""Dot's Poetry Corner"", ""The Great Wakkorotti"", and, of course, ""The Wheel of Morality"".  There's even a catchy song or two in at least one episode.  Hey, this is ""Animaniacs"", anything can happen in this series.

Such randomness features a plethora of puns and references to actual events and/or stories and movies along with hilarious antics and such like dropping anvils and dynamite down one's pants.  Some episodes also have very distinct themes like ""Cartoons in Wakko's Body"", ""Useless Facts"", and my favorite, ""Animaniacs Stew"".

So get your Yakko, Wakko, and Dot on with this new release on a 5-disc DVD set.  And don't forget to check out the feature ""The Writers Flipped, They Have No Script"" where we get to meet the madcap minds behind the stories as they discuss their best episodes of the series.  You know, all this excitement is making me geared up for volume three, which I hope is real soon !",1167264000,19,2056,4.746478873239437

2646112,5,B000HWZ4DO,"I probably don't need to go into how great this show was.  Others have already done that in their reviews of Volume 1 released back in July.  This second volume contains some of my favorite episodes, so I was really thrilled to have them.  There are several hours of these great cartoons here for you to discover or (as in my case) re-discover.  It seems they don't make shows like this anymore.

2646186,5,B000HWZ4DO,"Purchased this collection for my son (yeah right) It's a show i can sit and watch with him. The best contribution Warner Bros has made to animation since the original Looney Tunes.  Some of the familiar participants made it to their own shows (Pinky and the Brain), while others are just found here. The whole cast of crazies Slappy Squirrel, the Good Feathers and Rita and Runt as well as Good Idea/Bad Idea made afternoon cartoons in the 80's fun. The sets are boxed well and closed captioned...packed for safety I would recommend them to anyone who remembers the  show (and if you don't you should get them and laugh for the first time now).",1392076800,,644,4.591304347826087

2646190,5,B000HWZ4DO,"Just as funny as the first season, these cartoons are meant to please everyone from the young to the old. They are especially funny if you know your history or your social/political events of the 90's. So funny!

Animaniacs is a return to that time for me and my family.....great low and high brow comedy",1371081600,,301,5.02
2646219,5,B000HWZ4DO,I actually use some of the episodes in my fourth grade class as a teaching tool and even allow the students to watch some of the non-education ones as a treat. They had never seen it before and love it. The first one we watches was the 50 States and their capitals. They loved it and felt bad for Wakko when he failed to state his response in the form of the question. They also loved the multiplication song.,1369958400,,409,4.189873417721519

2646257,4,B000HWZ4DO,"Although some of the references to actors, films and politicians are a little dated (only those old enough will remember Bill Clinton playing sax), this was an excellent series of cartoons that I happily watched as a 20 year old on a Saturday morning whilst nursing the obligatory hangover.

20 years later and the humour has stood the test of time.  Suitable for both children and adults.  There are references to characters from history, film and US politics that kids won't get, but which adults will, but the style is very child friendly.  I now have a very happy 6 year old who has 5 DVDs of laugh-out-loud cartoon fun.

Shame one of the disks doesn't work (even though new)!  But given that I live in the UK, returning is not really an option.  It was certainly worth my while buying from US, even with international shipping charges, UK price for this was almost 100 ($150)!!",1313107200,,882,4.615384615384615

The scripts are simply fun--you can tell that the writers were having a blast coming up with these episodes.

2646264,5,B000HWZ4DO,When we were younger my best friend and I used to watch this cartoon all the time.  I bought it for her a while back as a birthday present and she loved it!  She is an elementary teacher and she uses it in her classroom as a special treat when the students have been good and finished all their work.  They really like it and she feels comfortable showing it to them because it doesn't have a lot of the violence and fighting that so many other kid cartoons have now.

2646267,5,B000HWZ4DO,"As hopefully most of the readers know Steven Spielberg had a hand in the production of this terrific series of cartoons. They are easily on par with the best feature films from Dreamworks, Pixar and Disney. The two comparisons that imediately come to mind are Shrek and Antz. In other words while there are lots of slapstick and visual gags, there are even more subtle grown up jokes, innuendos and hidden meanings. For those that understand Spanish, turn on the Spanish subtitles and get even more hilarity from seeing the translators get some things totally wrong.

My favorite episodes are the Animaniacs themselves on stage of various parodies of cinema or literary classics such as ""Moby Dick"" and ""Frankenstein"". The writing is brilliant and the voice over actors deliver the lines with gusto.",1270166400,2,799,5.007518796992481
2646268,5,B000HWZ4DO,"I love the Animaniacs. I watched them when I was younger and even now I love how clever the humor is. Compared to a lot of cartoons today, the ""adult"" humor that gets put into Animaniacs is rather clean, but at the same time hilarious. Spongebob has nothing on the Warner Brothers and their sister Dot.

I do suggest looking around before purchasing as I picked up a new copy of Volume 2 for ten bucks. I saw volume three for sixteen. I'd have paid 30 for such epic greatness, but I also enjoy a great deal! No matter where you get your Animaniac fix, you'll definitely want to own at least one of these volumes on DVD!",1269043200,,619,4.245762711864407
2646269,5,B000HWZ4DO,We've watched this several times and never get tired of the Animaniacs.  The characters are lovable and the music and song lyrics are classically good.,1264809600,,151,5.04
2646270,5,B000HWZ4DO,"The whole family - adults, teenagers, elementary aged - have all enjoyed these cartoons.  It was a lot of fun to see a ""blast from our past"" as we watched these cartoons with the kids.  We will definitely be buying all three volumes.  A must see if you enjoy slap-stick humor with a modern twist.",1249603200,,296,4.345454545454546
2646271,5,B000HWZ4DO,"Fox kids had the best shows ever, Animaniacs being one of them. In my opinion, Steven Spielberg's Tiny Toon Adventures, along with its follow-up show Animaniacs and all the other shows on Fox Kids were the very best animated shows of the early 90s. The Animainacs never failed to make me laugh when I was a kid and they never fail to make me laugh now that I'm an adult. Animaniacs is a show that's made in very good taste - it has really smart humor and nice cultural references, it doesn't have any dirty or obscene material, and as opposed to many modern TV shows, movies and animated films that try to be funny by being dirty, Animaniacs is very funny in a good, clean way. Animaniacs has something for all ages - kids and teenagers will have a lot of fun and will actually learn some life lessons along the way (the show has some 'educational' episodes meant to bring a message to the children), while the adults will appreciate the smart humor and cultural references. And of course, everybody will appreciate the top-quality animation created by some of the greatest animation studios of the day and will love the nicely drawn cute characters, each of which is well thought-out and has his/her own personality, and will adore the fun-packed stories in each of the episodes.

In case you're a fan of good, high-quality classic animation, or if you like animated comedy shows, or if you just like to have fun and if you have a good sense of humor, don't miss Animaniacs! If you got the first volume of the first season, I'm sure you'll adore the second volume too, and if you haven't yet experienced Animaniacs, it might just as well be a good idea to grab both volumes and volume 3 and prepare for a few days of fun and wackiness!",1235260800,3,1736,4.493670886075949

2646286,5,B000HWZ4DO,"The 2nd volume in the totally insaney Animaniacs is even better than the 1st. All of the skits in this volume are good. Even characters that I didn't like in the 1st volume have funny skits in this volume. They need more cartoons like this. A lot of shows today could learn something from the Animaniacs. Some of the best skits are ""Potty Emergency"", ""Chairman of the Bored"", ""Draculee Dracula"" and the episode where they mix up everybody's skits. I can honestly see why this show won an award. It's Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1184716800,,521,4.736263736263736
2646287,3,B000HWZ4DO,"I am a great fan of the Animaniacs, but watched them only as reruns, so I had no sense of the episode order.  Watching the episodes on DVD, I found that the second season was a noticeable decline from the (brilliant) first season.  Plenty of great segments, but enough mediocre/bad segments that you are likely to want to just skip over.

Packaging: Discs 1 and 3 are extremely difficult to extract (assessment by multiple people).  The center button doesn't release the disk and the finger indentations intended to let you grasp the edges of the disc have a rim that prevents you from doing this.  Friends have encountered this non-functional design in packaging of other DVD sets.  This failing is significant enough to be a one-star demerit.",1177286400,6,744,4.818897637795276

2646289,5,B000HWZ4DO,"I first started watching this cartoon when it was being shown on Kids WB I really loved it and still do today. I like the Animaniacs themselves, but I allso enjoy Mindy and Buttons(which in my opnion should of gotten more episiodes and later haveing it's own series like Pinky & the Brain becuase it's cute), Slappy Squirrel and KATIE KA-BOOM who's my all time favorite character on the show. In fact, if there wouldnt of been the same formula in every episiode she would of been a better known character and maybe even come up with a few more new episiodes. Overall, a wonderful, hillarious, cartoon!",1173312000,,601,4.626168224299065

2646291,4,B000HWZ4DO,"Volume 2 is good.  The series was great.  However, this shows all too well what happens when focus groups influence and formulas become rooted.  In this volume Pinky & the Brain begin their domination of Animaniac-land.  The focus groups had said that the Punch & Judy pair were crowd pleasers and so they started hogging more and more of the screen.  In that same vein, Slappy and nephew grow in popularity as they now spend most of their time blowing up things, with the dialog being the true victim of the onslaught.  Finally, who the heck thought that the GOOD IDEA/BAD IDEA guy could carry a 5 to 10 minute skit?  Still, Wakko, Yakko, and Dot show there mastery of the double and triple entendre and the lesser Animaniacs shine when they are given the screen.  My kids (6 & 3) love the slapstick (even if I now cringe at some of the carnage) and the plethora of war episodes (historical note: Gulf War I was going on during this time period) has let me have decent discussions about the current Gulf War with my little boingy boingies.  I recommend this collection, but if you can only buy 1 vlume, make it #1.",1171843200,16,1115,4.45320197044335
