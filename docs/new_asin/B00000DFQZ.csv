1199191,5,B00000DFQZ,dynamite surprise.  Arden is terrific and the dialogue witty to the nines.  I've always been a fan of Eve Arden and had no idea she was in this film until the front credits - comedy was surely her forte.  This is a must have.,1295827200,,225,4.068181818181818
1199192,4,B00000DFQZ,"This little unknown gem has it all: murder, mystery, comedy and a good plot.  I was totally surprised by who turned out to be the murderer.  Pat O'Brian is in rare form as is the rest of the cast. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I think that you will too if you like your murder mysteries laced with some humor.",1275264000,2,314,4.131147540983607
1199193,5,B00000DFQZ,"This fun and snappy little mystery from director Tay Garnett is every film buff's dream come true. It has a great cast, a good script, and best of all, hardly anyone knows about it! Ken Englund's smart sceenplay, based on the novel ""Send Another Coffin"" by F.G. Presnell, is full of witty one-liners in this breezy surprise every classic movie fan will want to own.

Pat O'Brien is attorney Johnny Webb and Broderick Crawford is his tough but easygoing assistant, Russ Sampson. Webb is trying to earn a huge fee for cleaning up the highway contract corruption which has led to murder. Edward Arnold is Vincent Cushing, the political boss he'll have to take down who also happens to be involved with Alma (Claire Dodd), Webb's ex-girlfriend.

When she gets knocked off on a windy night, both Webb and Cushing are the main suspects. Webb has become involved with the sweet but ditzy young Anne (Ruth Terry), and spends as much time trying not to take advantage of her as he does finding out who killed Alma. Neither is easy and both have some interesting and comical twists and turns.

Eve Arden is a ton of fun as Webb's sarcastic secretary Miss Ater, and B-movie favorite Phyllis Brooks has a fantastic turn as Sarilla Cushing, the gorgeous daughter of Vincent. She just happens to be Webb's alibi when a second murder occurs using the same weapon, which keeps turning up in Webb's office!

There is a surprising and spirited conclusion to the mystery and an equally satisfying one to the love angle, as the delightful Anne finally gets to stick around as Johnny's permanent girl. O'Brien and the rest of the cast are terrific in this delightful little gem that may just be the most entertaining mystery you've never heard of.

Finding films like this one is what classic movie fans live for. This is one that doesn't let you down. Keep in mind it's one of those public domain films so the print is decent if not excellent, but certainly one you need to see. Highly recommended!",1236988800,24,1978,4.672413793103448
1199194,1,B00000DFQZ,The quality of this dvd is so poor it should not be for sale. I could only watch a small portion of it and sent it back for a refund.,1214784000,5,133,3.466666666666667
1199195,2,B00000DFQZ,"The opening joke, immediately after the credits, is great!  And the exposition anticipates Bogart's IN A LONELY PLACE by several years, except the wrong female gets murdered.  Broderick Crawford provides an easy-going, endearing performance without a hint of his later lockjaw screen personality.  And the supporting cast--especially the adult women--are fine.

But this attempt to combine Sturges satire, screwball comedy, and ""My Friend Irma"" is done in by the irritating, obnoxious heroine of the piece who keeps popping up when one wishes she'd be shutting up.  The Irma-esque caricature is utterly unfunny and, repeatedly identifying herself as nearly jail-bait age, her romance with the much older O'Brien is as irrational as it is disturbing.  And what happens to Eve Arden is an unpleasant shock as well.",1155945600,2,812,5.404761904761905
1199196,5,B00000DFQZ,"Frank Presnell's first of three crime novels, ""Send Another Coffin"", is the basis for this film, completed the year following publication of the original, featuring flinty Ohio attorney John Webb (Pat O'Brien)  with his wife Ann (Ruth Terry), the duo patterned somewhat upon Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles, although Webb is less suave than Nick and more eager to stir political pots.  A corrupt state politician, Vincent Cushing (Edward Arnold), is the principal target for Webb's reforming urge, and when Cushing's mistress Alma (Claire Dodd), erstwhile flame of Webb, is murdered, nearly all of the major characters seem to have a motive, including Webb, who faces most of the heat from the homicide investigation although he perceives himself to be ""slightly honorable"" when compared with those about him.  The work includes a strong comedic element along with its murder mystery and socially conscious themes.  Vivacious Terry, with her patented energy and spirit, steals the film in what she states is her favourite role, a part for which she is promised by producer Walter Wanger and director Tay Garnett that the former night club singer/dancer will be spotlighted in a musical specialty number, and that she is, one that is perfectly woven into the screenplay, this while under personal contract to Howard Hughes who loans her to Wanger for this production.  A cardinal pleasure inherent with film reviewing is discovery of works that have not received an amount of recognition that they deserve, and that is the case in this instance, for it is a piece that includes among its attributes sparkling dialogue, skillful acting and, especially, that mastery of narrative pace and rhythm that marks the best efforts from Garnett who here cunningly blends details for his established mise-en-scne within the script, as is his custom.  Even without his foremost mannequin, Marlene Dietrich, Travis Banton's gowns are noteworthy and there is a strikingly illustrative score from Werner Janssen.",1123804800,13,2005,5.269592476489028

1199248,3,B00000DFQZ,"My main interest in this movie was Eve Arden as Miss Ater, a secretary to law partners Pat O'Brien (as John Webb) and Broderick Crawford (as Russ Sampson).  No one can deliver sarcasm quite like Eve Arden.  Unfortunately, she is merely a supporting character rarely seen.

The story involves corruption on the highest levels.  Featuring cronyism, murders, infidelity, betrayal, and a musical number.  Rife with comedy and a lot of backstabbing, I was immediately confused and put off by the abrupt changes in tone.  One minute the story was taut with suspense, the next minute everyone was falling over with slapstick and breezy dialog.  Even the score was circus-like!  I found this approach jarring and wasn't surprised to learn this movie lost approximately $107,709 when it was released in 1939.  I was especially frustrated by the sheer number of unlikable characters, especially Pat O'Brien as the framed lawyer.  His vile treatment of the nightclub singer (Ruth Terry) was perplexing.  Also, his character was more than slightly dishonorable, considering some of his tactics; it was difficult to separate him from the self-avowed crooks out to get him.

I didn't hate it because I did enjoy what little there was of Eve Arden.  It was okay.  But definitely not a movie I'd care to keep to watch again.",1433980800,,1308,4.99537037037037

1199254,4,B00000DFQZ,"You know, this really has a big name cast --- except maybe before they were such big names ;-) --- and a pretty good script. It's nice to see a good mystery, with snappy dialog that isn't quite as harsh as the new stuff. It's in pretty good shape for its age. Many of these older movies show women in a much more mature role for their age, and men knew how to be gentlemen. Remember Bacall and Bogie in ""To Have and Have Not""? Even perky and slightly dizzy numbers like Ms Terry have a sense of, well, sense. (I'm not as old as I sound... just too romantic for my own good ;-) I can't give this a 5, because there really are 5s out there, but I recommend this solid 4 to everyone over the age of 12. Sure, it's corny, in an old-fashioned way, but the snappy humor and romantic relief is not trite or banal. These older scores have a lot to offer as great entertainment. Pat O'Brien is a treat for all.",1412121600,2,901,4.067415730337078

1199270,2,B00000DFQZ,"A few good lines can't salvage this movie from itself.  The writer couldn't seem to decide if this was a slapstick comedy or a murder mystery or a political corruption movie so he tried to do all three.  The result is the slapstick isn't funny, given the circumstances, and the fliberdy-gibet of a girl is just annoying.",1374624000,,320,4.5964912280701755
