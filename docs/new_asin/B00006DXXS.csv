7967325,2,B00006DXXS,"This DVD has nothing to do with the dialogs and events happened in the vacations in THE Real World seasons. I am angry to myself not caring about the other customer reviews.

It show the videos of where did they go,what did they eat,did they get sick etc.. which are very very boring stuff preventing you to see the dramas and partying happened in these vacations. If i want to know what can be eaten in the exotic places of the world i can find it on the google.i want to see how the real world house spent their time when they are on the vacation.

very dissapointing for me to what i expect and what i get.",1224547200,,609,4.1525423728813555
7967326,5,B00006DXXS,I have loved the Real World ever since I saw the Boston series a while back. Now the Exotic Vacations has arrived and just bought it. And it's great. You get to see almost every trip the Real World casts have been on and never seen footage. Buy it!,1037750400,3,248,4.081632653061225
7967327,3,B00006DXXS,"This DVD was ok because unlike ""Decade of Bloopers"" there was alot of new footage shown. It shows vacation clips from the Miami, Boston, Seattle, Hawaii, New Orleans, Back To New York seasons as well as the Chicago season's unseen vactaion to Boston (they were supposed to go to Europe but didn't due to 9/11). The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because unlike the ""You Never Saw"" series this video only offers a few hillarious moments and isn't something I'd watch more than once. I would say it is better than ""Greatest Fights"" or ""Decade of Bloopers"". I say just rent it or get a friend to buy it and borrow theirs.",1034208000,10,620,4.4
