8539476,1,B009C30MOU,"Modern attempts by goofy directors to set Shakespearian plays in the 20th century really turn me off. This production was no exception. It is awfull!!!
If you really like Shakespeare, pass this one up. The 1968  Zeffirelli version, while not perfect, is still the best on the market. (Directors who attempt to rewrite Shakespeare also turn me off. I don't mind an occasional deletion for the sake of brevity, but changing the words entirely is just plain wrong. Do they think they can write better than Shakespeare?)",1507766400,,516,4.931034482758621
