8106181,2,B000E5N38C,This DVD isn't much of a workout. Get Booty Call by the same people for a great workout!,1219795200,,88,3.9444444444444446
8106182,4,B000E5N38C,"I got volume one which I reviewed on that page.
DVD Menu choices are: play, basic moves, full workout, chapters & tease (does the routine normal speed 1x)
Tricia Murphy thankfully counts a lot less & the music is a bit better, still synthesizer style, but better then the first.
The stage is cute with black & red accents. It's Tricia with 2 blond female backups, one who about a size 14 & the other slim.
The workout is about 55 min long, with about 10+ floor moves in 2 different sections then the first making it harder & a small amount of steps several times to get the heart rate up.
There is still some cooling off & this is more of dance routine DVD then an aerobics one.
Some of the moves were a bit too cute & made up such as the ""Betty Boop"" where you cross your arms over your chest, then hips which shifting knees. It works & it's cute, but not erotic. The dance moves seemed more for stage or dance video then something slow & sensual. There still is almost no body awareness, they go through the motions, but seems like the moves could be more sexy with the right attitude that the women don't convey as much either due to production or shyness or no body awareness of their own. It's kinda done with little enthusiasm for dancing, more like ""eh, if this is what turns on my man, uugghhh, fine, I'll do it, but I won't like it, I don't feel attractive/sexy...."" This is what turned me off the most. Real dancers aren't afraid of their own body or enjoying how it moves, even martial artists are aware in an enthusiastic way, though different.
I think to make this dvd better would be to teach the moves 1 at a time, narrating as you do them, doing many times before going on to the next. This way, you know it by heart & never have to review as much as a dance routine asks you to.
If you  expected a slower, sensual routine, take off 2 stars & get a belly dance dvd or the ""art of sensual dance for everyone"" (that one is gentle for shy women who have no idea how to be sexy). If looking for body awareness & be sexy deep down, take off 3 stars. If looking for a fast dance speed routine & a little workout thought taught is a slow pace, this might be more up your alley then most striptease ones.",1149465600,9,2212,4.168224299065421
8106183,5,B000E5N38C,Urban Striptease Aerobics (volume 2) was one of the best workouts I have had. If you enjoy dancing and are looking for a fun way to encorporate dancing and exercise this is it! The dance moves make you feel girly and sexy while getting a great workout! I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes to have fun!,1143417600,3,313,4.322033898305085
