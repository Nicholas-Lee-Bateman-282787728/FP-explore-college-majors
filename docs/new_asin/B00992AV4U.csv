8537961,5,B00992AV4U,"Beautifully done, hard hitting Scandinavian series of independent productions.  There are a total of 9 productions released in Scandinavia which are slowly being English language captioned and released on television in Great Britain then released onto dvds for sale or streaming.  These are the original productions which were followed by the TV series which was also really good.  These longer length shows allow for fleshing out of the characters and issues so pungently stated in the author's original written work.  Highly recommended.",1425168000,,539,5.536585365853658
8537962,5,B00992AV4U,"Beautiful cinematography, great characters.great acting.  Rolf Lassgard is flawless in his portrayal of Wallander.  No other actor cannot replace him in this role.",1387843200,,163,6.043478260869565
8537963,5,B00992AV4U,"I have read all of the Henning Mankell ""Wallander"" series and this Wallender is closer to the original Wallander than any of the others.  THe stories are closer to the books and I absolutely love Rolf!  Great series and I hope another DVD set will come out with him in the starring role.",1372896000,2,287,4.39622641509434
8537964,5,B00992AV4U,"This package contains the final four Wallander productions starring Rolf Lassgrd as Inspector Kurt Wallander and presents them exactly as they were screened during their original and repeat presentations on BBC4 in the UK. This means that two of the films are broken into two. They are the full productiuons with no cuts and English subtitling.
Lassgrd is my favourite Wallander of the three available - Kenneth Branagh and Krister Henriksson also filling the role years after Rolf.
The stories here are far closer to the original Henning Mankell novels than you will find in the more recent BBC Kenneth Branagh adaptations. The Branagh versions all seem to be able to be squeezed into a very convenient 90 minute film. These versions are of varying length.
Marie Richardson stars as Kurt's colleague Maja. Richardson is a fine actress and luckily more can be seen of her in another Swedish production - legal drama Oskyldigt Dmd, available in the UK with English subtitles.
More recently BBC4 have screend two older Lassgrd stories Sidetracked (screened as a two parter in July / August 2012) and The Fifth Woman (screened as a four part mini series in August with one episode gaining the highest ratings ever in the UK for a subtitled screening of Wallander). I'm hoping that these two along with the earlier three (as yet unseen in the UK) will be available on DVD soon as well.
If you like a decent detective story with characters with a decent amount of layering, then this set is for you.",1349308800,18,1494,4.817120622568093
