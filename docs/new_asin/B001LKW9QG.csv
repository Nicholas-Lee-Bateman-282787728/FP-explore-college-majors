3686170,4,B001LKW9QG,"This is a review of the NC-17 (category III) release.
The award-winning, blockbuster Spanish horror film ""REC"" had already been remade for U.S. audiences under the nom de plume ""Quarantine"". I have seen both horror films, and I have decided to focus on reviewing the original film rather than comparing the two. Directed by Jaume Balaguero, ""REC"" is a film that adapts the first person, POV style shaky camera style that was first adapted by ""Blair Witch Project"" and later on also in ""Cloverfield"" and even Romero's ""Diary of the Dead"". The film has the B-grade movie feel, but the director made it work. After all, what better way to emulate realism with a DV camera than for the movie to look very unpolished and rough around the edges? I'll get right to the point, I enjoyed ""Quarantine"" but ""REC"" is a lot better.

A television reporter named Angela Vidal (sexy Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman, Pablo (Pablo Rosso) is covering a local fire stations in Barcelona for a TV show called ""While you're Asleep"". Things seemed very uneventful, Angela is just hanging out with some local firemen, Alex and Manu (Ferrah Terraza) until the station receives a call to an apartment building where screams have been heard. The TV team tags along with the firemen and meets up with local police officers. Once there, they find an old woman seemingly frightened and attacks one of the policemen. Suddenly, Angela, the firemen and all the tenants of the building become trapped inside the building by a Hazmat crew and they have been isolated from the outside world. Things go from bad to worse as things go out of control as the tenants become mysteriously infected that makes them violently feral. Angela and Pablo may not survive the night...

""REC"" has the type of plot that is very simple and follows established groundwork for zombie films such as the ""28 Days Later"" franchise. A supposed virus that causes violent behavior isn't really original but the film's execution is very strong in generating suspense and claustrophobia. I am not really a big fan of the shaky POV style camera work but director Balaguero does pay attention to the smallest details as to how this style should be executed. There are some gaps in the camerawork, some sound being unrecorded and the camera does take certain shots that make the viewer feel that Pablo is indeed running for his life. When it comes to terror, ""REC"" does not disappoint, the camera does feel like it is a significant part of the film rather than a gimmick.

The film's style feels very rough and edgy. (Quarantine was polished and beautified) The film looks very simple and stays close to realism. The apartment looks very normal until the lights go off--then we see how the direction takes over in the horrifying sequences. The film is nicely paced and a little short at 79 minutes but I thought this was a clever move. The film is essentially a chase film with Angela, Pablo and Manu running for their lives with no way out, the outside world have no intention of helping for fear of a pandemic. Its short runtime makes the film leaner, more intense and faster-paced to generate the scares that it never lets up. The film has the recommended doses of BLOOD and Gore which are perfectly timed and placed. As for its plot, ""REC"" downplays any solid explanations as to the source of the virus until the final act where it gives hints to the cause with a hidden laboratory. ""REC"" strongly states that ""we're not sure what is going on.."" and yes, any solid answers as to the virus will somewhat remain a mystery and lack solid closure. Is it something demonic or something biological?

Much of the film's strength would have to come from the lead characters. The film does have some rather less than impressive characters; an Asian couple, a homosexual super, an intern from a hospital, and much of their developments come from the interviews Angela performs while waiting around. These are your everyday normal folk, people we wouldn't pay attention to when we walk down the street--they look very real and a little silly, much like the folks we see everyday. Manuela Velasco looks, talks and behaves like a reporter; much of her emotions come from a reactionary performance and Velasco certainly pulls it off--the viewer will have no problems feeling sympathy towards her character.

""REC"" is the type of horror film that is smart, simple and plays on all its strengths that it manages to make the simplicity of its plot a main part of its direction; along with its rough and edgy claustrophobic atmosphere. While it does have no involving subtext and engaging characters, the film is incredibly tense, that the direction manages to bring about chills and thrills that all its suspense would come from its fast-paced build-up that uses that genuine feeling of helplessness. The final act of the film also serves up the incredible reward as you become privy to one of the freakiest images ever seen on "" make believe"" POV camera"". This Spanish horror film may not be offer anything groundbreaking, but it certainly is solid, competent and entertainingly freaky!

Highly Recommended! [4- Stars]

3686171,4,B001LKW9QG,"This little low budget Spanish made Film is a something I came across after heaing about the movie Quarantine. i had heard that this is th original version..I for one always watch the original before the remake. I haven't seen Quarantine yet..but this movie looks very similiar to that of the previews on Tv for the American version.

[REC] is very similiar to 28 Days Later and Dawn OF The Dead. Same story as always;a virus spreads,you get bitten you turn into them..that simple. What makes this movie shine is the approach. the acting in this movie feels real..it didn't feel as if people were acting,no it felt like how someone would react in a situation so frieghtning as in the film.

The movie begins with a female reporter working on a documentary inside a Fire Station. the reporter and cameraman decide to tag along with the fire dept's crew on a cruise along the city...to see what is exactly what they do. They arrive at an apt where neighboors are complaining about somone upstairs...I will not get more into details,but let me tell you,as soon as the police and fire dept crew enter...it gets really scary. the apt gets sealed completly,meaning no one gets out...and ofcourse the virus spreads...its insane

 One of the best things the director managed to do was to make the film in documentary style all the way. Now unlike cloverfield or blair witch,in this movie you actually see whats going on...its not all shaking to make it look scary and confusing. From what I have heard the movie is almost scene by scene like that of Quarantine. I honestly don't know why hollywood keeps doing this,butchering,copying,and insulting audience with re-makes..its like they cant get there own idea. Even though I have yet to see the American re-make,I am more than sure this one is still better. by the way if you do plan to buy this movie, I sugest that you watch it in its original language;the dubbed version is horrible. I watched like 2 min of it dubbed in English..and it wasn't pleasing...good thing I understand Spanish. But don't worry,it has English Subtitles for those whp don't understand the language. Either way even though it's not entirely original,it still kicks in some new scary moments...definetly a must own by horror fans.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5",1234569600,2,2280,4.776649746192893
3686172,3,B001LKW9QG,"I had the opportunity last week to catch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001MVYUQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>, the 2008 American ""re-do"" of 2007's [REC]. So I said to myself, ""why not give the original a look to see if they were on par with each other."" And [REC] was worth the look. But why do I call Quarantine a ""re-do"" instead of a ""re-make"", you ask? I'll get to that in a minute.

{REC} is a very well done Spanish film by Jaume Balaguer & Paco Plaza that kind of combines the idea of Rage virus infected maniacs from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;with the notion that zombies and demonic possession are nothing more than a mutated virus strain. Oh don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here!

I mean really...both movies ultimately offer no better explanation for the origin of what's going on than any of its predecessors. I'd say that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000YPUFAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;& 28 Days Later make the best attempts to suggest origins for why ""zombies"" are walking the earth, but even those leave the door wide open to prequels or sequels that change the whole idea of ""what started it all.""

So enter [REC} with a somewhat unique explanation (a la videogame-esque recording device found by the characters late in the film) of why zombies haunt this story. But before that device is found, our characters go through a Hell of being trapped in a multi-level apartment building with some pretty ghastly creatures. 99% the same story for Quarantine.

The camera work in both movies is unfortunately in the same vein as some recent films that tried to present a more realistic environment with a single hand-held camera capturing all the action, a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blair-Witch/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blair Witch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B001CDLARQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>. But all that the hand-held camera work really does is annoy the living dead out of ya.

Somewhere between 2007 & 2008, little known Director John Erick Dowdle basically stole [REC], inserted American actors and released [REC} as a ""re-do"" in America under the title Quarantine. Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2008 version of Quarantine is clearly just a re-do.

I'd recommend catching one or the other for some good fun scares. There is no reason to see both.",1232496000,,3096,6.430288461538462

8318609,4,B001LKW9QG,I heard about this movie from a couple of Spanish speaking friends of mine and decided to give it a watch.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the actors did at giving the movie an authentic news crew b-roll/filler feel to the footage.  They really made you believe that this really could have been filmed by some poor local news crew out shooting filler for some local station somewhere in Spain.  In fact I enjoyed the movie so much that I went and saw the American version Quarantine also.  I don't want to give the movie away for those that haven't seen it but if you are a fan of horror movies then give this one a try.  You will be pleasantly surprises too.,1268179200,,667,4.304

An Spanish film,recorded in my city, Barcelona. It took me a bit to get involved with this film, because I don't like reality shows.
But, the last 20 minutes are worthy. What an end!!

8318611,2,B001LKW9QG,"I usually don't like the remake of foreign films, but I was surprised that in this case the remake ""Quarantine"" was far better and smoother. This one (REC) is amateurish for 75% of it, except the end is not too bad.",1245369600,,215,4.2682926829268295
8318612,5,B001LKW9QG,"Finally the long awaited wait for [REC] has come! [REC] is quite possibly one of the best horror films to come out in a long time.

[REC] is overly scary!! it's a movie so driven that it makes washing your hair with battery acid feel more pleasant. It rocks you in the face and stabs your brains with your nose bone. The fear and look of this film is like a look into reality caught on camera and it will disturb most viewers, it's quick scenes of rabid attacks are like ice picks piercing ones eyes, it's like a film that will give you the shivers, the kind like sticking your tongue onto frozen ice and pulling away quickly to rip off a layer of skin exposing the underlying bloody tissue that is the movie [REC]

[REC] starts off with a news reporter, the ever so cute Manuela Velasco and her camera man Pablo. They are making a documentary at a small time fire station dept. Soon they will realize that it's going to be a a night of sheer terror. They receive a call to rescue an elderly woman, They never would have suspected that a first call to that night would be their last. As the group of fireman, police and the camera crew begin to walk upstairs they find a gentle night air is pierced by the sound of horrific screams and things take a turn for the worse. So they find the elderly woman creeping around her apartment dripping with blood from her mouth, all the police, fireman try to help her out until CRUNCH!!! she takes a livid bite out of one of the fire mans body and leaves him in a shaking frenzy, As this is happening the building is being sealed off by the government allowing no one from the building to escape. With no escape the crew finds out later that they have no way of escape, they find themselves surrounded by frightened residents who are infected with a violent bacterial infection.

These infected had so much power, A bitten little girl had the power to attack a police officer. As the carnage is building deeper and deeper the government sends in the center of disease and control to take samples of the infected. As all hell starts to break loose like a soccer riot we have the infected fleeing up the stairs like they were on crack cocaine, They were freakin animals!!! they were like a pack of wolves looking to feed on anything they could sink their teeth and gum lines into, if they got a chance they would Pop your blood sockets and drink you friggen dry.

Now Angela and her camera man Pablo are searching for a key to release themselves from this building and end up in this room, The last room they could possibly see if they don't find a way out. Both Angela and Pablo come across news articles and audio tapes of some kind of demonic possession. Moments later there's a segment where the lights go out and Pablo's forced to use night vision and when the possessed creature jumps out of the dark to attack its almost as if you are standing right there. In fact you never even see the cameraman its almost as if he's you! The ending in what could be one of the scariest and deranged moments ever caught on film. My teeth were clenched and my jaw felt locked as I found myself tense in excitement nearly ever couple of minutes. [REC] is one of the best Spanish horror films in recent memory. Those final 10 minutes will go down in history, I can assure you that.

8318613,5,B001LKW9QG,"As anyone that loves the horror (and especially zombie) genre knows, the past few years have been one 28 Days Later clone after another on one side and a slew of Blair Witch wannabes on the other. I'm not a fan of either one since I prefer ""undead"" zombies to ""virus"" zombies and shaky camera work makes me either nauseous or annoyed in most cases. So I should dislike this combination intensely, yes? Oh my no no no no.

I won't recount the entire plot since you can find it elsewhere and it isn't really the main attraction. What made this one work for me was the sheer level of non-stop (and realistic) intensity from the first victim all the way through to the end.

Sure, a lot of the jump scares are the ""loud noise out of nowhere"" variety, but in their contexts they work; the cop shooting the infected old woman is jarring enough, but when the reporter is in shock and demands to see if the cameraman ""got"" it they throw in a secondary shock with brilliant use of rewind. The same shock twice in quick succession works quite well.

As for the hand held style, it's done very well and there were only a few parts that had me reaching for the Dramamine. The actors handle their roles very, very well and quite a few scenes could pass for real interview footage if you weren't watching a movie about Rage Virus killer zombie type things.

And then there's the ending...WOW that ending. David Lynch meets George Romero. That's all I'll give away, but I have to admit that's the first time in years that a horror movie scene has had me literally on the edge of my seat and my jaw on the floor. Love it.

Hey...I got through the whole review without saying how inferior and pointless the Quarantine remake was! oops.",1240963200,,1718,4.406940063091483
8318614,5,B001LKW9QG,great film . much better than the american remake . I highly reccomend it !,1239753600,,75,4.066666666666666
8318615,3,B001LKW9QG,"This is a decent film ruined by shaky cam headache inducing directing. It conveys the realism and the acting is top notch, but it ain't scary, unless you've never seen a horror film. Although it's fairly tense. A decent amount of good practical special f/x help in the realism as well. Diary of The Dead uses more steady cam techniques and is better suited for this kind of film, though I think this may be the better of the two. But I can watch that one again this I won't because of the shaky cam work. If you can handle Cloverfield you should check this film out. I haven't seen Quarantine but I imagine it's more of the same, although it never acknowledges that it is a remake of this film. Probably the original filmmakers not wanting to have anything to do with the US remake. This could have played in cinemas in the states instead of remaking it.",1239408000,,854,4.377358490566038
