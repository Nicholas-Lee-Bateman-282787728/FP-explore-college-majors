447720,4,6302281725,"Based on Bizet's tragic Spanish opera, this was Rita Hayworth's first film made by her production company, Beckworth (derived from her screen surname and from the name of her daughter, Rebecca). She decided on her close friend and favorite leading man, Glenn Ford, as Don Jose to her Carmen. The results are far better than some reviews would have you believe.

The glorious, lush Techincolor is fabulous (studio-bound as most of the sets may be), while Hayworth's unforgettable screen presence, dancing and bewitching beauty, and the heat generated between her and Ford makes this movie memorable. The sequence in which she describes what virtues a lover should have (complete with putting her finger to his lips) sparkles with sensual static. Granted, Ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform (after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his ""bandit clothing"", he appears much more relaxed).

If it is deemed worthy enough to be released as part of the Columbia Classics collection, so should ""Affair In Trinidad"", another Hayworth/Ford collaboration.

It's just great to look at, flaws aside. If you adore Rita and Glenn, even in a tempestuous, volatile romance, this movie will provide that for you.

Was there ever a more enticing, tempestous gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and ultimately tragic love?",1140998400,15,1332,5.013574660633484
447721,5,6302281725,"I recently decided to purchase this film on vhs instead of dvd, because I figured there were probably no extras. Needless to say I was extremely delighted at the superb quality of this movie on a used vhs tape!!! Rita was simply magnificent as the wild gypsy Carmen!!! She came alive as the red-haired vixen like no other. The dance scenes alone are worth seeing this passionate film. I agree with another reviewer who felt that Glenn Ford was miscast as the don who falls for the electrifying Carmen, but it's of very little importance because Rita Hayworth completely carries the film. When you have a film starring Rita Hayworth it doesn't matter who her co-star is!!!",1116201600,28,671,4.743589743589744
447722,5,6302281725,"I have watched this movie again and again, and I can't imagine a better Carmen than Rita Hayworth!  Her Carmen is a free spirit, proud, sensual, intelligent, and yet vulnerable too.  Glenn Ford may have been slightly miscast as Don Jose, but he and Rita had such a chemistry that they make this film work.

What really sets this film apart, though, is Rita's fantastic dancing!  She was raised in the tradition of Spanish dancing from the time she was about 4 years old--she came from a famous family of renowned Spanish dancers--and it's such a pleasure to watch her do what must have come so naturally to her.  No other dancer can match her for her sheer gracefulness and passion.

I've only seen the DVD version of this movie, so that's the version I'm recommending.  The colors are luscious and the photography is clear and crisp.  And the musical score is very moving.  This film may very well become one of your favorites, especially if you're a Rita Hayworth fan!",1109808000,29,970,4.625730994152047

The movie, however, is beyond melodramatic and turgid. The dialogue is often hysterical. While Rita (a Latina whose real name was Cansino) is actually pretty impressive as the gypsy Carmen, the otherwise reliable Glenn Ford is hopelessly miscast as the naive Spanish don who falls under her spell.
But if you love simply to behold Rita (and I do!), this is the ultimate feast for you. She is beyond stunning in this film.",1021593600,56,695,5.15929203539823

I agree with all, but want to add that on the Rita Hayworth plusplus side, there is Gilda (1946) and the Lady from Shanghai (1947), which are both still top and fresh, and as b/w, don't have this silly overdone makeup (red cheeks and the works). Glenn Ford plays his role of a dumb Don Jos with considerable skill - reminding you of Gilda, where Miss Hayworth and Ford are both great class, but her top in my judgment still is her Mrs Bannister in the Lady from Shanghai, with able seaman Orson Welles as the super-dumb.

Her role as national pin-up has for much too long made people forget that she could also be a brilliant actress on top of her genuine sex appeal, given the right role and director. What could have been made of Carmen is something along the Marlene Dietrich/Josef von Sternberg vehicles like The devil is a woman (1935), which indeed is what the Hayworth/Welles' Lady actually is! Or Mlle Deneuve/Buuel in Tristana (1970)! The better can be done, my point is, it has been shown.

The spirit of the gypsy Carmen in the movie comes from the opera Carmen.
This longer more detailed Hollywood story of a soldier who sells his life for the fleeting love of a beautiful gypsy woman who has the heart of a thief and the morals of a harlot is a tragedy.
I don't think that the acting was quite up to that level here.

447795,3,6302281725,"The Loves of Carmen - Rita Hayworth & Glenn Ford
I remember seeing this film when I was quite young thinking I was going to see the movie version of Bizet's opera Carmen. I was disappointed at first but seeing the beautiful Rita Hayworth in the title role made quite an impression. I remember what I thought was more dancing done by Hayworth than was shown on this DVD. I also thought that the cigarette factory scene was longer as well as the fight among Hayworth and the other gypsies who worked in the factory. Glenn Ford seemed also to have longer scenes edited from what I remember. Then on the other hand, I might be confusing the film with the opera. Maybe it was all a child's fantasy memory of a classic film, but I do remember how beautifully Rita Hayworth danced in the screen version. The DVD somehow did not capture this. Maybe the fault was trying to make this classic film into a DVD.",1219881600,2,899,4.389221556886228
447796,4,6302281725,"""The Loves of Carmen"" is a glorious Technicolor costume romp set in Spain.  The film was promoted as based on the same novella that served as the source material for Georges Bizet's opera.  There is a gypsy girl, Carmen (Rita Hayworth) who works in a cigarette factory; and a young dragoon, Don Jose (Glenn Ford), who inadvertently kills his Colonel in a duel over Carmen.  This movie has its fair share of melodrama, but it is not the Bizet opera.

This version is not a musical but there is a beautiful film score by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and lively dancing choreographed by Rita's father, Eduardo Cansino.  Rita Hayworth was a trained dancer who came from a family of dancers going back generations.  In one of the dance numbers, her partner is her Uncle Jose.

This was the first film from Rita Hayworth's own production company, Beckworth.  She made it a family affair.  In addition to hiring her father and uncle, her brother Vernon is one of the dragoons.  The film also reunited her with her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilda/dp/B00004XPPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilda</a>&nbsp;director, Charles Vidor, as well as co-star, Glenn Ford.

The DVD features a beautiful restored print in glorious Technicolor.  The audio track is crisp and clean.  The film can be viewed with English or Portuguese language tracks; subtitles are available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai.  Special features include stills of vintage advertising, theatrical trailers, `talent files' -brief biography and filmography information on Charles Vidor, Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, and Victor Jory; a featurette, ""Rita Hayworth: The Columbia Lady"" which gives an overview of her life and career and is available on other DVDs of Hayworth films, such as ""Gilda.""

If you like full on Technicolor cinematography, gorgeous costumes, and melodramatic story lines, this is highly recommended.",1215302400,6,1945,5.545762711864406
447797,4,6302281725,"""She's bad all the way through. She lies as easily as other people drink water. She's a liar, a thief and a cheat. Has no more manners than my Great Aunt's cat. She's really awful. And I'd sell my soul to hear her say just once she loves me.""

1948's The Loves of Carmen may dispense with Bizet, but this lavish `straight' adaptation of the classic tale of destructive love from the days when Technicolor was still glorious does reunite Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford with their Gilda director Charles Vidor to good effect. The passion may not burn as hot or as deep as in Prosper Merimee's novel or Bizet's opera but it's fairly grand entertainment with all the production values that only the studio system at its height could provide even if idealistic young Spanish officer Ford's brooding over his ruined life and amoral gypsy temptress Carmen's fickle affections does threaten to get on your nerves in the last third. Hayworth wasn't yet a good enough actress to make the most of the part, but she certainly scores in the allure department.

Ford was not able to make audiences believe in him as the Spaniard with spoiled love life since his acting forte usually followed a much different romantic approach--Offer the heroine yourself, the prospects of a happy future and a direct sexual approach, open and above-board...
