One scene from the movie really resonated with me, When the Rabbi asks Bambi his new Son-In-Law to say Kaddish for him when he passes and Bambi refuses. The Rabbi says to him, ""Measure for measure"". I think that is the whole premises of this movie ""Measure for Measure"" what we put out in this world returns to us good or bad. How we measure others is also how we ourselves are measured in life.  Our arrogance can sometimes damage our character. In the movie, we even see his son who has become religious let his arrogance guide him and in return it causes him trouble.",1498608000,,648,4.355371900826446
