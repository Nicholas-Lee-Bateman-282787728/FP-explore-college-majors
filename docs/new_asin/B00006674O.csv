7961967,3,B00006674O,"I have ordered this movie twice from two different sellers and both time couldn't watch in Russian. The first DVD actually started in Russian, and then after 10-15 min switched to English and never recovered. I returned it and bought another one, and this one never even tried in Russian; I pick ""Russian"" option, but it speaks English.
I gave this item 3 stars not for the movie, but for the defective recording. I love this movie and really wanted to have it, but couldn't stand English translation. But I am sure for American viewers  it doesn't matter and they will enjoy it. It directed by one of the best Russian/Georgian directors, Georgy Danelia, and the cast is brilliant.",1291161600,,681,4.722689075630252
7961968,5,B00006674O,"The film should be watched along with ""The Conformist"" by Bernardo Bertolucci that treats this theme from a different angle.

In no way this is a film about Soviet life and/or Leningrad although that's were the action take place. This is a brilliant film about conformism.  Place and time are actually immaterial to the idea of the film in the same way as in ""The Conformist"" by Bernardo Bertolucci. You can easily imagine the same situations and the same people in Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sacks or the Congress (especially in the Senate; talk about lobbists here ;-)

Conformists are people who are unduly influenced by other people. This influence occurs in both small groups and society as a whole. In the USSR it also was also (at least partially) the result of direct social pressure to confirm to the ideology of the ruling gang.

But such behavior also is affected by personal traits and the main character of the film is something like the ""ideal conformist"". Such people are overly affected by expectations of others to the extent that they systematically betray their own interests and behave like a marionette in the hands of the person which whom they currently interact. That's what the film is about. It a very sad comedy with huge amount of psychological truth in it. Some moments are even difficult to watch to the absurdity and at the same time extreme realism with which behavior of such people depicted.

We can only speculate is this due to high insecurity, or specific personal traits (including what is commonly called ""weakness of character""). But at the same time the guy is still pretty socially successful and that suggests that unwillingness to conform (typical to revolutionaries of various sort; see the film ""How the Steel Was Tempered"") also carries with it the very real risk of social rejection. In the film extremes meet. In some aspects conformity can be seen as a safe means of avoiding responsibility (and bullying) as well as attempt to make a peace with often confrontational  peers. But as we can see from the film in its extreme it turns to something completely opposite.

A very telling part of the film is the part when our main character rebels against his own conformism and how soon he retreats into his usual stereotyped behavior.  In a way there is no escape from this role and that makes the end of the film somewhat tragic.",1247356800,,2374,4.787286063569682
7961969,5,B00006674O,"I have not partaken in this DVD itself, but I have one small comment on the film.

Lost in translation would be the best way to put this - many non-Russian viewers, particularly those with only a passing interest in the Russian culture - will be stumped.  One particularly negative comment here implied that this film is some kind of a morbid realist exercise.

Daneliya is far from a realist, of course.  Even in the early years when he was starting out - which means adhering to commonly 'realist' approaches to filming - Daneliya made films that were, for the lack of a better word, animated.

Those who know about Daneliya are aware that after 'Marathon' he became quite creative, making ""Tears Fell"" (1981) and ""Kin-Dza-Dza"" (1986) which bordered on the surreal, mixing theatre and a kind of mysticism that is beyond words (I wanted to say indigenous, but I'm treading risky ground here).  Needless to say he's a strange guy and, of course, Georgian.

This is Daneliya making a popular film - the signature elements are more subtle.  'Marathon' is about the Russian experience, a sad comedy - meaning, a film within a film.  We have the drama involving infidelity and the comedy is within and is easy to miss.  Our foreign viewers will attempt to relate to the foreigner within the film - the Scandinavian scholar who, after initial trepidation, embraces the country and all that comes with it.

Of course, our character within the film actually speaks Russian, meaning that when we see him get jailed for drunkenness and utter ""horozho sidim"" (repeating Leonov's lines), we know that he gets it and those of us who speak Russian also get the joke.  However our foreign viewers who watch this subtitled will have the line translated as something like ""aren't we having a good time?"", which doesn't get the joke across at all.

What is the joke?  Well, I suppose it's either just for us Russians or for those foreign viewers who love our culture enough to find out.  Without this you will only get the infidelity portion and that, by itself, won't fill in any blanks.",1206489600,,2071,4.729805013927576
7961970,4,B00006674O,"Could have been titled ""The Salmon"", as the main character is a master of maneuvering through the eddies and currents of a demanding circle of people in his life. He lies almost unceasingly and in a skillfully benign manner to make everything go smoothly. He also has a great capacity for calmness, and when he finally can tell the truth, albeit briefly, the result is the same, sparing the recipient just enough to keep things acceptably tranquil. I found it amusing and really quite even in all aspects of the filmmakers craft.",1121990400,,529,4.760869565217392
7961971,4,B00006674O,"It is funny indeed. However, the Spanish audio track is no good, as they put the Spanish audio directly on top of the Russian audio, so you hear both, and it isn't dubbed -- one guy reads all the Spanish translation (so there is never any female voices in Spanish).",1098748800,2,265,4.32
7961972,2,B00006674O,"I would have thought a good reason to see AUTUMN MARATHON (1979) is to get a glimpse of Leningrad (present day St. Petersburg) before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. St. Petersburg was then, and is, a lovely, pastel-colored city of canals and grand buildings.
Andrei Buzykin (Oleg Bassilashvili) is a university English professor, translator, and author with women problems. After twenty-some years of marriage, he no longer dotes on his wife, Nina. He does adore his young mistress, Alla, but she wants a permanent relationship and is driven crazy by the alarm on Andrei's watch which spurs him off to other commitments. Buzykin also loves his daughter, Lena, but she's becoming more distant as her own marriage evolves. And if all this isn't enough, Andrei's publisher wants his next book sooner than later, and Andrei spends too much of his free time helping a visiting Danish scholar translate Dostoevsky and advising a translator colleague on the writing of her own book. Buzykin, at 45, is steering towards male menopause. Perhaps he should emulate another acquaintance, who chills out by drinking vodka and gathering wild mushrooms in the forest.
The reputed excellence of AUTUMN MARATHON is that it depicts the ordinariness and subtle absurdities of everyday life. However, if Buzykin's existence sounds mundane, believe me, it visually is; I don't need a bigger dose of ordinary than what is provided by my own daily regimen, starting with looking in the mirror after I get up in the morning.
My wife, who tossed in the proverbial towel two-thirds into the film's run time, quipped that it lacked ""pizzazz"" and ""took too long to get anywhere"". However, I'm made of sterner stuff. But, while Buzykin gained my sympathy in a distant sort of way, I couldn't help but think that the film might have been improved with a tweaked script, tighter editing, and Jack Lemmon in the lead.
And Leningrad? The director and Mosfilm made almost no effort to showcase the city. There was no obligation to do so, of course, and I concede that my criticism on this point is unfair. But if you're filming in the Cold War era and plan on releasing the finished product to Western audiences (where it proved award-winning, for reasons that escape me), then why not give the city a PR boost? Even a quick jog past the fountains in the rear of Peterhof or across the facade of the Hermitage would have helped immeasurably.",1057708800,6,2413,4.88780487804878
