Total running time: approx 56 min

My girl loves Peso, so without knowing the episodes I took a gamble on this DVD because he was on the cover.  Each kid will have their personal favorite episodes, mine doesnt care for the 3 regular ones offered on this disk.  But The Great Penguin Race has been high on her list for a while now so this disk is a winner for us.
I ripped it onto my computer with no problems and it plays fine on all our various devices.  I was a tad nervous having never bought a disk from Canada before.
I got this DVD in the autumn when prices were not inflated for the holidays.  Id have felt ripped off if the price were in the double digits given how few episodes are on it.",1386028800,3,807,4.167741935483871
