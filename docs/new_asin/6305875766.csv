The video is based mostly on late 90s footage as opposed to vintage footage. The same goes for the bloopers in the VHS. Worth the 0.001 i spent on it, lol.",1358035200,,273,4.074074074074074
7897159,4,6305875766,"This is a fun video, no question about it.
The boys on my team still remind me of the case of the ground ball that was literally ""blown"" foul. By the way, it's legal.
Or team-mates putting shaving cream on top of one of the players hats.
Or, better yet, some of the truly amazing and great plays in this video.
That was the upside.
The downside is that there's too much talking at times, with some of the players trying to do comedy bits just for the camera. The bits are dated, and at least for us here outside the US, are complete non-sequitor. Ugh. Leave this, and just give us baseball.",1042070400,,590,4.230088495575221
