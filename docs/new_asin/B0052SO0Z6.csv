8454360,4,B0052SO0Z6,"""Snake River Desperadoes"" is a Durango Kid B-Western made in 1951.

Most Durango Kid westerns are average entertainment but this one is not.
In fact this one is well above average and I would regard it as one of
the best. Sony Pictures have done it full justice by selecting it for
digital restoration and they have restored it to pristine condition in
both picture and sound quality. Good work Sony.

Another good feature is that there is only one title on the disc and
unlike disc sets, you don't have to tab through a list of titles to
find something good to watch. A little more expensive but a lot more
convenient.

The story told concerns a group of desperadoes who are stirring up
trouble between the white settlers and the Indians by masquerading as
Indians and raiding and killing the settlers. Their plan is to start a
war and to make lots of money by selling rifles to the Indians.

The Durango Kid (Charles Starrett) is drawn into action by two young
boys namely Little Hawk (Don ""Brown Jug"" Reynolds) the son of Chief
Black Eagle and Billy Haverly (Tommy Ivo) the nephew of Trading Post
owner and villain Jim Haverly (Monte Blue) and together with the
assistance of his bumbling sidekick Smiley Burnette, all work
together to prevent a war and unmask the bad guy responsible for the
trouble.

""Snake River Desperadoes"" is a welcomed departure from the many
years of routine productions. The numerous harmony songs by various
groups over the years has been discontinued. They were really
unnecessary, meant nothing and only took up valuable story-telling
time. This has left the way clear to tell a more in-depth story and to
extend the action scenes. Smiley Burnette sings a few humorous songs
and with his comic relief this is all that is required.

Good, above average entertainment.",1348790400,4,1798,4.746794871794871
