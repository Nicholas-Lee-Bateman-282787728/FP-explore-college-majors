8710115,1,B00VH3PBDU,I am not sure what the other reviewers are talking about.  I tried this on two different Blu-ray payers and it did not play.,1529625600,,124,4.166666666666667
8710116,4,B00VH3PBDU,"This should be on DVD and Blu-ray in the U.S. That it's not is a shame. It's a well-done series. This DVD will indeed play on U.S. players, but it did not play on my PS3, only my PS4.",1481068800,,183,3.717948717948718
8710117,5,B00VH3PBDU,Amazing show and it works on American blu ray players and PS4 systems.  I'm very happy and excited to have this show in my collection.  Jon Bernthal rocks!,1471996800,,155,4.5
8710118,5,B00VH3PBDU,"Mob City was for the most part well done and I enjoyed it enough that I wanted to own it on disc. However I should say that the review is about this Blu-Ray set, not the television series. I want to clarify the product information of this Blu-Ray for US buyers.

Currently if you want Mob City on disc this German made import is the only way to own it. The Amazon product description contradicts itself by saying in one part that the discs are All Regions but then going on to say This Disc WILL NOT play on standard US DVD player. A multi-region PAL/NTSC DVD player is request to view it in USA/Canada.

I have purchased this 2-Disc set and just want to confirm for US customers that this import will play in your US Blu-Ray players without issues. The menu is in German but easy to follow and use. The episodes can be watched in the original English audio or dubbed in German. The only subtitles in the episodes are when there is a newspaper headline or sign there will be a German translation for it. There are also 5 short making of documentaries in the extras section; they are all in English with German subtitles. Subtitles cannot be removed on the episodes but can be turned off (with remote) for the documentaries. As one would expect from a Blu-Ray disc picture and sound quality are excellent.

I was happy that this German import Blu-Ray set gave me the chance to add Mob City to my movie collection.",1458432000,3,1412,4.402298850574713
