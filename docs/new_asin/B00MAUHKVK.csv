6567264,5,B00MAUHKVK,"Excellent drama. Took me back to the 1940s when I was a young teenage sailor operating with the british fleet out of Plymouth, England. The Land Girls used to come to the railroad station to hook up with lonely, friendly Yanks. They were a happy bunch and very flirtatious. Just wanted to have fun with someone who could take them to tea or lunch. They really liked to pull our legs about things we knew nothing about. A perfect picture for a memoriable timein UK history.",1294790400,74,472,4.5
6567265,1,B00MAUHKVK,"The Brits usually do this kind of thing suprerbly, but not this time. Every single cliche you can imagine is trotted out here by the no-talent writers and in such a way as to signal their arrival without any suspense or surprise. Everything here has been done a hundred times before and so is utterly predictable. How different from the excellent 1998 movie of the same name! This series is an insult to the intelligence. Riddled with historical inaccuracies, it presents the gritty, bleak war time Britain as all warmth and light in which everyone wears lovely clothes and has prefect skin, despite rations which supplied meat only once a week (if you were lucky), fish three times a year, fruit almost never and milk and eggs usually only in dried powedered form. What a piece of crap this is!",1291248000,42,795,4.685714285714286
6567266,5,B00MAUHKVK,"Well, I loved it and uniforms not being the right shade won't stop me enjoying it! It's a drama!

It made my daughter (10) ask lots of questions about the war as well and it was wonderful to watch it with her and talk about what life must have been life in those days. I thought the Home Guard were made to look human - or were they all saints?

And I don't think it was anti-US - the black GI was written as a nice guy - but it did highlight the segregation that happened in the war. And my daughter was intrigued by that!

It's great that its on DVD at last as there was so much crammed in that it'll be good to watch it again and see what we missed.

Great stories, lovely clothes and good fun!

Relax and enjoy it for what it is. Perfect Sunday night telly!!",1289952000,8,762,3.954248366013072
6567267,3,B00MAUHKVK,"I ordered this series in honor of my mother's best friend, Evah, who was actually in the Land Army during the war, and married an American soldier & came to the US after the war to live & raise her family. She has always fascinated me with her stories of how she would work in the fields, and how the ""Yanks"" would behave towards the women in the villages. As I sat down with Evah & my mother to watch this, I was so disappointed when she pointed out several inaccuracies from the get go. Namely, the way the girls dressed as they were working in the fields. They were required to wear uniforms, & no girl would ever be in the fields in ""short shorts"" or ""polka dot blouses"". Also, if any of the girls got pregnant, they were sent home. They would not have been allowed to remain in the Land Army. Another inaccuracy was the fact that my friend hardly saw any black soldiers in her village. The units were not segregated at that point. She said there were never signs up saying ""whites only"". There were no American female Army Officers in charge of the men at that time either, because women were serving as nurses, or in clerical positions at that point in history.

I don't know why the producers of this series felt that they had to make it politically correct. It was blatantly meant to be an insult to the United States.

Having said all of that, I would recommend this series to anyone who loves British TV as much as I do. I would just want to warn you about the inaccuracies that were pointed out to me by my friend who was there, and lived it!",1288483200,212,1553,4.261016949152542
6567268,5,B00MAUHKVK,"Land Girls is a drama delving into the lives of four women of the Women's Land Army in England and how their stories interconnect.  While sharing hardships and working the land, they build a unity that they'll remember a lifetime.  The scenery is gorgeously filmed and Nathaniel Parker stunningly plays the Lord of the Manor along with his wife played spot on by Sophie Ward.  This 2 disc series brilliantly captures the spirit of the Women's Land Army while dramatizing the personal stories of the four women and their environs to tug on the viewer's heart and mind.  No wonder this wonderful BBC dramatic series won awards.",1286755200,45,625,4.813084112149533
6567269,1,B00MAUHKVK,"The four girls of this new series ""Land Girls"" are engaging.  The village is pretty.  The other actors are very good.  But to think this is a real story of those times is to be disillusioned.  First I must protest the terrible portrayal of the ""Home Guard"".  In reality, a group of decent men who served England as the first line of defense on home territory.  Comprised of WW One soldiers and officers, men disabled, men to old or ill to serve in WW2 it is an organization that deserved a better voice in this film than they have received.  In this film the Home Guard soldier in charge in the village where ""Land Girls"" takes place is portrayed as a lunatic.  Putting a dreadful face on a worthy organization.  Shame on the writer.  And how tiresome that once again, the lady of the manor is a bad person, etc. and her husband is a cowardly philanderer.  YAWN!!!  So drop in some AWOL activity, racism, sex, out of wedlock pregnancy, and adultery not to mention hoarding and black market activity.  IN the midst of all this mayhem, is there a war going on?  How about exploring the fact that Britain would have starved without the contributions of the agricultural world of the U.K.  At the beginning of WW2 this country imported nearly all of their food stuffs.  It was the job of land girls not just to take the place of men in war but to help increase the amounts of food to feed a nation at war.  I wonder why the true stories of life during WW2 in England were not enough for this writer.  Any young person might think this ""fiction"" is a genuine portrait of a village in England during war time.  But here at this website one can find many books that have come out in recent years.  The published diaries of hundreds of men and women of all classes who lived in England and lived through this war.  Here is one.  ""Nella Last's War"".  Instead of buying this DVD buy that book.  And like myself, ask this writer why he could not have written a true story of a village at war.  By the way, there are several films some made in the U.K. that give a better portrait of what life was like without the sugar coating of propaganda.  For example, ""The Canterbury Tales"".  It is my sincere hope that this writer tries to create a more honest film next time or give up altogether ""historical fiction"".  I think the next Spiderman movie for example?",1281312000,62,2345,4.378190255220417

6567282,5,B00MAUHKVK,"A DRAMA, not documentary, done expertly by BBC to honor the service women gave in WWII. It takes a rap for changes, such as costume color, but the experience of seeing a stunning filming of a very dramatic portrayal of the times is well worth the liberty taken for the sake of aesthetic license. The spirit of the times and of the ladies is there. There is an episode that shows almost all of the unpleasantries that also goes along with wartime. One episode continues into the next.

Of course viewers can recognize that not every soldier and civilian lived a life exactly like the characters of this fictional presentation. One uncaring Yank does not make an army of such. As in the wonderful series ""Foyle's War"", the episodes offer glimpses into the 40's time, and a taste of the home front war. It is sometimes so spectacular in visual imagery that one forgets it is wartime. The acting is spot on. Costumes convincing, sets true. You will be enriched, enlightened, see romance and humor, as well as suffer the losses felt by characters. The writing is authentic enough to keep this war gals' story away from the column of `chick flic'. It's home front reality, scripted as fiction..

NO SUBTITLES OR CC, or bonus materials.
Land Girls Series 1-5 episodes. I recommend you watch them in order.
Land Girls Series 2-5 more episodes, each with their own main plot, but all carry over from the last series and have continuing issues and cast.
Land Girls Series 3-5 more episodes with much of the same cast offering depth in character development. This series has a bit more romance. See every episode synopsis on my individual series reviews.

Definitely one to own for watching each year. However, buying sets 1,2,3 individually, used, is cheaper. But the new combo price is cheaper than when I bought mine. Loan to friends who like war period British drama. Remember, it's not an historical documentary, it has some altered facts, but that's done for entertainment value.

So shame on us white Americans for our racism in the 1940's, but perhaps the BBC should explore racism in Britain in the 21st Century.

I'm somewhat surprised that this series never made it to the U.S. market as it is very well done and enjoyable. Perhaps it did and I somehow missed it. At any rate,

However the plots feel like they come straight from soap operas, which wouldn't be that much of a problem if any of the characters were likable. That's the main reason that I didn't think the show was that great. It is an impressive feat to create a flawed, well fleshed out character that a viewer feels like rooting for.

Having women doing 'a man's job' used to be a very complex subject, not without social conflict.
 The cutie poses of these actresses immediately illustrate how far from history this treatment is.
 Just Google 'women's land army' for accurate photos. Those women wore uniforms and were proud of it.
 There was a concept of 'showing one's best form', which had nothing to do with looking coquetish, flirty or 'cute'.
Seems it must be easy to forget that every hour of every day in wartime,every little action could mean the difference between becoming a conquered people, or not.

The other thing that bugged me was the self-righteousness way the Brits were portrayed when faced with American racism. This seems to have become a cliche in many British TV series. Since I had a father in WWII, I know racism was rampant in the US military, but it was, after all, the Brits who brought slavery to America, and there is still racism in the UK and everywhere. I wouldn't rave about this show, with all the cliches mentioned by other reviewers, but I'll still look for Series 2 and 3 on Netflix streaing, because it does transport me to another time and place, unlike most of the junk on TV these days.",1336003200,6,908,4.496969696969697

Without having seen the first episode I had high expectations for Land Girls and they were met.  The other reviews are critical of historic inaccuracies and poor writing but if you are watching this for a history lesson or something beyond prose you are missing the point entirely.  The show details daily life on a farm during WW2 when the women of England took up the jobs men had to leave behind during the war.  Each main character deals with interpersonal relations, frustration from the work, and some romance.  Social issues about social class, gender roles, and societal expectations are also explored.  The show is great at holding your attention and being fast enough moving to where each 40 something minute episode feels more like 20 minutes.  There is a mix of comedy, serious drama, and some sentimental moments thrown into the work.  I would say to go for this series if you are a fan of time period pieces that take you back in time to a place before people became to isolated and fake with things such as smart phones and computers.  The only downside is that a season consists of only 5 shows.  With any luck the BBC will run this show for at least a total of 5 seasons minimum.",1334880000,2,1330,4.593220338983051

I thoroughly enjoyed it though, especially seeing Summer Strallen, who I saw on stage last year as Meg Giry in Love Never Dies in London.

6567325,4,B00MAUHKVK,"This was another excellent series portraying life during WWII in the English countryside. I totally enjoyed the episodes and rushed through them with total abandon. Thankfully, there is a follow up series, which I have ordered and expect to see soon (Land Girls 2). The acting was excellent, the scenery superb, and the historical setting seemed to be quite authentic. I was very glad that I had the opportunity to enjoy this series.",1312329600,,433,4.945205479452055
6567326,2,B00MAUHKVK,"I was very disappointed and wish I had saved my money.  While the costuming and scenery is lovely the acting in this production is at about a high school level.  Not up to par with usual BBC standards.  If you want good WW2 drama, buy Foyle's War.",1303171200,8,247,4.212765957446808
6567327,3,B00MAUHKVK,"The actors, scenery, costumes were as expected from a BBC production - well done.  Hate to give a middle of the road score to such an effort but the plot portrayed the characters as either/or crazy, stupid, selfish and mean.  For every five minutes of kindness evidenced there was 40 minutes of back-biting and scheming - bad behavior to the point of being painful to witness - well out of proportion to daily existence even in such difficult times.  Kept thinking that the next episode would make it worthwhile but it was bitter until the very end.  Shame, shame, shame.",1299456000,9,571,4.68
6567328,5,B00MAUHKVK,"I am a BIG fan of ""Foyles War"" and found ""Land Girls"" a continuation of the story of the young women who came to rural Britian to escape the bombing raids.  I imagine that the story is very true-to-life for land owners, laborers and the girls who did a man's job on the farms. Forbidden love affairs keep it very interesting!!!",1297036800,13,327,4.360655737704918
6567329,5,B00MAUHKVK,"A DRAMA, not documentary, done expertly by BBC to honor the service women gave in WWII. It takes a rap for changes, such as costume color, but the experience of seeing a stunning filming of a very dramatic portrayal of the times is well worth the liberty taken for the sake of aesthetic license. The spirit of the times and of the ladies is there. There is an episode that shows almost all of the unpleasantries that also goes along with wartime. One episode continues to the next.

Of course viewers can recognize that not every soldier and civilian lived a life exactly like the characters of this fictional presentation. One uncaring Yank does not make an army of such. As in the wonderful series ""Foyle's War"", the episodes offer glimpses into the 40's time, and a taste of the home front war. It is sometimes so spectacular in visual imagery that one forgets it is wartime. The acting is spot on. Costumes convincing, sets true. You will be enriched, enlightened, see romance and humor, as well as suffer the losses felt by characters. You will wish for more.

UNFORTUNATELY NO SUBTITLES OR CC, or bonus materials.
5 Episodes (aired Sep. of 2009) each about 45 min. Each episode advances in time by about 3 months.
Childhood's End
The village of Helmstead changes with the arrival of Joyce and Nancy. Joyce has a new enlisted RAF hubby, Nancy is drafted to the fields. They join Annie and 17-year-old sis Bea at Hoxley Hall, that of Lord Lawrence & Lady Ellen Hoxley. Pasture Farm is also assisted by Frederick Finch and son, Billy. Women's Land Army Girls are overseen by Esther Reeves (her hubby a POW) who has a son with her, Martin. The secondary plot has Yank troops caught up in segregation issues, and one lady-loving Corporal.

Secrets- 3 mo later
Bea's liaison with a GI gives her unwanted morning illness and the want of a `cure.' Home Guard Tucker searches among land girls and POW hands for a spy, forcing Esther's aid. Lawrence has a lame horse with Joyce helps try to mend. Lord Hoxley is a bit friendlier with the girls, compared to his wife. Secrets abound.

Codes of Honour- 6 mo later
Lawrence and Nancy like barn lofts. Nancy's secret is uncovered and arrest follows. Old man Finch has his own narrow escape from the law while Joyce and husband, John, risk much for love. Honour comes with differing codes.

Trekkers- 9 mo later
Families who have been bombed out of their home hit the road (Trekkers). Some join the field help as John returns to duty and Nancy and Lawrence continue their thing. There is more romance afoot, as well as action, resultant of Trekkers. Bea has a big day, while Annie is surprised.

Destinies- 12 mo later
A wedding takes place and is attended by unexpected guests. Annie has a choice to make. Lawrence makes his, to leave. As does Nancy. Guns and grenades cause a suspenseful climax, nearly upstaged by romance and sudden circumstances.

The saga continues in 5 more episodes airing in January, 2011.
1-Back to the Land; 2-Displaced Loyalties; 3-Final Reckoning; 4-Fight the Good Fight; 5-Darkest Hours.
Will it take a year for these excellent parts to be offered on DVD? Let's hope not.

The only negatives to this HISTORICAL PERIOD FICTION DRAMA are the subtitle absence and wish for more episodes. Remember it's not a documentary. Not a history book. It's romance, period drama, some wartime suspense, a bit of action on the home front, and beautiful scenic filming. My wife and I will watch it again, & soon.",1296172800,15,3467,4.690789473684211

8671246,3,B00MAUHKVK,"This is a very pleasant escape if you need to avoid thinking about overfed and under-principled dictators around the world.  The scenery is beautiful, but the music and the whole feel of the show reminds me of dramatic prime time soap operas like Dynasty and Falcon Crest.  The music and script are also right out of an 80's miniseries--very dramatic.  I love the actors, I've seen several of them in other BBC shows and enjoy their work in this as well.  Enjoy the escape, and don't take it too seriously--that's my advice.",1505520000,,524,4.663043478260869
