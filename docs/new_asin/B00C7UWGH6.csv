I thoroughly enjoyed the concert and the film. The movie was very cutting edge for it's time, and the new sound mix really makes one feel like they are at the show. I watched it on a Big Screen, with 5.1 digital sound, and cranked it up so loud that a neighbor came over to complain, but he ended up watching the movie with me!!",1477785600,4,433,4.166666666666667

8578458,5,B00C7UWGH6,"I recorded a copy off Palladia a year or so ago for my TV unfortunately missing some songs as a result of commercials.
I have watched this copy nearly once or twice a month for a year. I decided to purchase the original film to get all of
what I loved then and now of Paul McCartney. I can now watch it without ads whenever I want. It's a wonderful concert
better  than most seen today. I saw the Beatles in 66 and Paul McCartney three times in concert since then.",1446681600,,464,4.0989010989010985
