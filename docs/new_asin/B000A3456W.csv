2355442,1,B000A3456W,"I got 10 minutes in and I cannot take this.

First, the description of this documentary is fallacious "" But with food scientists altering the DNA of our crops, can we be sure what we're eating is safe?"" This is a classical example of the appeal to ignorance. Just because we do not know something, does not make it bad.

John Hagelin states that no studies have been done on safety, yet he also states that scientist are ""deeply divided"" if GMOs are safe. Lots of studies have been done. and if no studies have been done, how can they be deeply divided?

he also goes on to say that they bring genes from other animals, he leads to the idea that by placing fish genes in a tomato, that someone who is allergic to fish could have a reaction. Being allergic to fish, does not mean if a single gene is used that it will cause a reaction.

Dr. Peggy Lemaux states that science has ran a muck, the film makers then insert a clip of a nuclear explosion. These are two different and unrelated things.

Paul O'Conner questions the history of Monsanto, but only mentions their failures, not their successes.  Edward Jenner did human medical experiments on kids. He exposed healthy kids to kids with an infections and deadly virus. In doing so he developed the small pox vaccine. Edison failed many times creating the light bulb, saying he failed and not stating that he did all kinds of great things is not quite fair and is the fallacy called ""Conformation bias"". You take the evidence that supports your claim, but you ignore all others.

All that was the first 10 minutes.

Full disclosure, I am a firm believer of GMOs I do not think we can feed the world without them, heck, we are failing with them.

Update:

I managed to get through the rest of it, and I did not find any evidence that GMO food is indeed bad for you. Granted, I was doing house chores while it was on so my attention was divided. They kept bring up the point that ""we don't know"".

The filmmakers are making a claim that it is bad for you, the scientists they interview say at best that ""they don't know"" if they are bad for you or not. That is how science works. We cannot prove that something is not bad for you, we can only prove that they are.",1457568000,9,2213,4.3341404358353515

2355448,5,B000A3456W,"I agree with other posters.  Vote in the grocery store!  Do not buy the poisonous foods. Remember, this piece was made in 2005 - 10 years ago.  Since then, our food has become totally contaminated.  First, do not eat processed food.  It's the reason for the obesity and illnesses our society is suffering from.  Secondly, simply do not buy it if it isn't organic, or at the very least, have a Certified Non-GMO label.  Just don't buy it.  Don't listen to what sellers try to tell you.  If you care for your health and your loved ones, don't put them at risk.  Finally, please spread the word about this documentary on Facebook and other social media.

We're at a tipping point where the chemical companies are desperately trying to hide their dirty facts, and they are doing all they can to confuse consumers who simply haven't done their homework.  They try to say GMO is the same as hybridization.  NO, it is not.  They buy off 'researchers' and 'scientists' to get positive reviews but they've been caught in this dirty business.

The best way to do this is simply shut them down.  Don't buy their products.  (You'll notice that some of the pro-GMO people act as if it's perfectly natural to poison people because it is science.  No, it is not and it is not OK. )",1449792000,6,1266,4.502202643171806
2355449,5,B000A3456W,"The film is well done. It asks us to think about a few things. First, why would the GMO companies like Monsanto be so opposed to labeling if they were really proud of what they have done with the food? What have they got to hide? If GMOs are so great then they should want to label all the food! But they are fighting hard to stop it!
Second, we are made aware there have not been any human studies--we are the guinea pigs. Unfortunately, as shown in the film, the FDA says it's all ok. We know from many of these type films that many former Monsanto execs and scientists now work at FDA. This is typical of the cozy government/industry relationship in many other federal agencies as well, unfortunately.
Finally, apart from contacting your representatives in Congress (which is easy to do on the internet), to ask them to ban GMOs --and in the meantime get labeling, the only way we can vote is in the grocery store buying healthy food that is the least processed possible and preferably organic.",1447200000,10,997,4.483516483516484
