7827610,5,6302498678,"This is a visually beautiful film. I had great respect for the framing of each scene and shot; a true work of art. The message of the film can be a bit heavy handed ---  at times it felt like propaganda in terms of a vision for Mexico. However, one must have great respect for the strength of woman and campesinos fighting the brutal regime of drunken force, greed and indifference. Viva Mexico.",1384387200,,395,4.410958904109589

7827613,5,6302498678,"Emilio Fernndez was one of the most distinctive directors that ever lived. His unique and masterful artistry can be noted in every scene. This film is about Rosaura, a school teacher who goes to a small rural town, only to find corruption and injustice under the rule of the local landowner, Don Regino (well played by Carlos Lpez Moctezuma).
Maria Felix is a vision of feminine perfection. Beyond her extraordinary physical beauty, there is her strength, and her lovely, soft and musical voice. A wonderful actress, full of grace and greatness.

The cinematography by Gabriel Figueroa is magnificent, and despite its age (made in 1948), the film is quite clear and sharp. The titles are set against the work of Diego Rivera, and don't forget to notice the fabulous painted coffin !

This is a serious film, with no lighthearted breaks in the drama. It's a passionate paean to courage, honor, and the majesty of simple people.",1184630400,4,926,4.89171974522293
7827614,5,6302498678,"The opening and closing scenes of this film must have seemed hopelessly sentimental, even in 1948.  I could barely keep watching thru the first 20 minutes.  If you can get past that, however, there is much to admire here.  Gabriel Figueroa's noirish camerawork is truly haunting; images will stay with you long after the film is over.  Outside the film's opening and closing scenes, the story avoids an excessively conventional narrative style, moving very slowly and calmly to a gentle climax.  The insights into pueblo life may seem exaggerated (like the shooting of a boy for taking a pot of water), but I would bet many of those events derive from real life memories from Fernandez's childhood.  There are still a few areas in Mexico to this day where life approaches that level of desperation; to say nothing of the state of affairs in the 1940s.  Finally, Maria Felix gives a wonderful performance in the lead.  In fact, all of the roles are performed at a level that was high by any standard of the day.  In sum, this is a truly great Mexican film from its greatest ever filmmaker.

Regarding the DVD, the image quality is not exceptional but certainly never impairs a proper enjoyment of the film.  There are no subtitles (neither English nor Spanish) and no extras worthy of note.  Hurray that this has been released, especially at such a steal of a price!",1108252800,8,1365,4.713080168776371
7827615,5,6302498678,"Before Maria Felix appeared in this film, Mexican critics would say that Maria was incredibly beautiful, but her previous performances were not that brilliant.  After this film, Maria won the Mexican Ariel for the best actress of the year.  Undoublety, one of Maria Felix's best movies.",1013299200,3,286,5.195652173913044

7827617,4,6302498678,"Rio Escondido is one of Maria Felix's early movie performances.  This movie is beautifully filmed and captures the desert northern Mexican landscape.  This film is representative of the Epoca de Oro (the Golden  Era) of Mexican cinema.
Maria Felix plays ""Rosaura"" a  schoolteacher who is assigned to a very remote village, by government  officials.  Playing a strong willed female she challenges the wealthy  haciendado (and town bully), who controls the people, the water system and  the town's social fabric.  Rosaura, along with a medical intern, slowly  dismantle the grip that the haciendado has on the townspeople, by  empowering them.  A morale dilemma ensues: is vigilantism every  right?
This is a compelling story which illustrates life in the remote  villages of Mexico around the 1930's where government infrastructure was  lacking (some may say it still is).  The movie is beautifully photographed.  Maria Felix' performance as a feminist in a machismo culture, proves to be  surreal image.
The opening credit montage is designed by Diego Rivera  with what look like woodblock prints of agrarian life in Mexico.
A must  see film for any fan of Maria Felix or the Epoca de Oro genre.",947635200,9,1195,5.157068062827225
