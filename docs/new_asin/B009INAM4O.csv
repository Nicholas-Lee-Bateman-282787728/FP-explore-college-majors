5340589,5,B009INAM4O,The series was a very good becasue Ryan finds out who his father is and Grimlock step up in his master plan.,1359417600,,108,3.9545454545454546
5340590,4,B009INAM4O,"It sucks that the episode : Grimlords House Of Fear is not on volume 2 , but what kinda makes it up to me is episode 49 with the robot monster Vanbot . I wish Bandai Toys would have turned him into a transforming toy , because he's sort of like a new Renagade Gobot . Which reminds me ; when will the rest of Challenge of the Gobots come out on dvd ? It & the next volume of the VR Troopers better have carriter bios on everyone from their respected tv shows .",1358553600,3,460,3.8526315789473684
5340591,4,B009INAM4O,"A mere three months after Shout Factory released the first 26 episodes of VR Troopers comes this DVD set covering the second half of Season 0ne (or at least most of the second half...more on that in a bit). The saga of Ryan, Kaitlin, and JB continues as they deal with more of Grimlord's menacing mutants. Many of the episodes on the set are a joy to see, but the standout ones are the four episodes that comprise the Defending Darkheart story arc. This saga, in which Ryan finally learns the fate of his long-lost father, is dramatic and emotional, and is a must see for every VR Trooper fans. Other episodes feature the Troopers being turned into children, encountering the Ghost Biker, and fighting Grimlord's own VR Trooper. There's even an episode in which Ryan and his talking dog, Jeb, switch bodies! As you can probably guess, hilarity ensues.

This set also contains a pretty cool five-minute clip that was made to introduce the series. Originally included on various Power Ranger tapes released in the 1990s, the promo includes a few differences from the final show, such as having Professor Hart look more like Albert Einstein and different voices for Grimlord and Jeb. It's fascinating to watch, and I hope that Shout will include the Cybertron promo (the original concept for what would become VR Trooper, with Jason David Frank A.K.A. the Green Ranger as the main character) in a future set, as well.

Alas, what keeps me from giving this set a five-star rating is that one episode, Grimlord's House of Fear, is missing from the set. Thus, despite the package art mentioning that there are 26 episodes on the set, there are really only 25 episodes. Shout Factory has been made aware of the problem and is currently working on replacement discs in order to rectify the situation. Until they are ready, either hold off on buying the set, or buy it now and then send in a proof of purchase when the discs are ready. Either way, keep checking back with Shout to see when the discs will be ready to go.

Here's to hoping Shout will start bringing out Season 2 real soon!",1358208000,10,2079,4.644021739130435

5340603,5,B009INAM4O,"This is another show I grew up watching, along side Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Many people will say this show is a rip-off of Power Rangers. I wouldn't. You can say it is similar in many ways, and different in others. I am just glad they finally started putting this show on DVD. The quality is pretty good for it being an older show. The first run of these DVDs does include errors though. The first episode on disc 1 is missing, even though the episode listing on the cover slip says it's included. And there's 2 or 3 more errors when the slip claiming episodes are on a certain disc when they are on another disc. However, if you email info@shoutfactory.com proof of your purchase (online - screen shot of your order, in person - picture of your store receipt, or even a picture of you holding your DVDs), along with your full name and mailing address and let them know you would like the replacement disc and artwork for Volume 2 they will send it to you at no charge. I would have had this review up sooner, but wanted to wait for my replacements to see if they were corrected. They were and it took less than a week a receive after emailing Shout! Factory.",1363219200,,1165,4.348623853211009
