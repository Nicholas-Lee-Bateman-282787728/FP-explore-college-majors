3726034,2,B001O2SHM6,"74 minutes of my life I will never see again. I'm going to try to run through all the horrors of this ""film???"" not much in the way of dialog and what there is makes no sense. So many dull ""art"" type shots (scenery, water, a tree)zzzzz, Lots of walking, just walking. Scenes that are meaningless. At Least 20 minutes of very dark Golden Gate Park and Ocean, can't see anything. Jasper is straight but he and mark had some experiences in high school, then Mark dated Lily, why? On this Halloween night mark still wants Jasper wants what or who, he just broods and looks for ecstasy. Mark's friend shows up and tags along, why? They find a body? Why? why is Lily even in this? She has a couple lines. Apparently plot is not an imperative in this thing. Tedious, monotonous and aimless. BTW, how much do they pay the people who put blurbs on the DVD covers? Unique, Masterpiece, Haunting????? Big crapola! Oh the 2 stars are for the actor who plays Mark the only decent actor in a very lost cast.",1409616000,5,993,4.372972972972973
3726035,3,B001O2SHM6,"The Lost Coast (2008). Unrated. Running Time: One hour, 13 mins.
Directed and written by Gabriel Fleming.

Jasper (Ian Scott McGregor) sends Wendy (Sarah Nealis) a Yahoo email to tell her about what happened last night, but first he decides to confide to her what also happened in high school. This is tough for Jasper to write about.
  The story begins with Jasper going to Mark's place to meet up with him and Lily. He has known Mark (Lucas Alifano) and Lily (Lindsay Benner) since high school. The story also takes us back to the time they went to the Lost Coast in Northern California.
  Jasper didn't have time for a costume. Mark is wearing an overcoat with only underwear and a plastic member straight out of it underneath. Lily has ghostly makeup on her face, dyed black hair and a face mask to wear on the back on her head. They all go out to Castro for Halloween. It becomes a strange night and for old feelings.

Also in the cast: Chris Yule, Rob Hatzenbeller, Steve Potts, Bradley Mena.
  Lucas Alifano film debut.

Filmed in Golden Gate Park and San Francisco, California.

Very nice cinematography and sound. Good soundtrack. Original score by Nathan Matthew David.

Features: Director and cast Commentary. Deleted Scenes Commentary. ""The Lost Interview"" with Director and Cast.

I wish their was more dramatic story to this film, especially between Jasper and Mark. I kept saying to myself, if we could just get Lily and Caleb out of the picture....maybe...just maybe. This is not an ending that gay audiences will enjoy. But this film does have some breath-taking nature scenes and nice music.",1388707200,,1609,4.7898550724637685
3726036,5,B001O2SHM6,"the acting a cinematography of this independent film is comparable to the remarkable cult classic ""Lillies"". This is deep and moving addition to any collection.",1382832000,,160,5.44
3726037,2,B001O2SHM6,"I had been meaning to see this one for ages and now wish I still was; I saw it as a rental whilst `working from home' today and on reflection I would rather be doing my actual work. This has to be thee most below average `gay' films I have ever seen.

It is about a group of friends who went to High School together, Mark has always fancied Jasper but has come out and now lives with his ex girl friend, Lilly. They are going out to get wasted on Halloween and they are in San Francisco. Jasper tells the story of their big night out through a tediously mediocre email he is sending to his fiance -Wendy (the girl playing her phoned in her performance for the ending bit). This he does whilst we get to see all of the non events unfold from the previous night and morning. The writer and director (Gabriel Fleming) does try to go for an atmospheric piece, but the story is so weak and action so elusive that it just becomes a strained montage of shots of trees, landscape and dark bits of a park. The music nearly works a couple of times but there is so little for it to build up to that it really is a forlorn hope.

What action there is and this may be a `plot spoiler' but I think the writer already spoilt most of the plot any way. Sorry yes the action is fag hag losing it (I have got more angry at my toaster), a gate crash of a dull party where the host tries to man `pleasure' Mark (Lucas Alifano - who is actually quite a good looking bloke), and then a semi consensual pleasuring a bit later on and a dog fetching a stick out of the sea. I am making it sound better than it is and at 74 almost endless minutes you may want more than a couple of hand `tussles' and some dog exercise.

If you want to see every `gay' film in the world then this should be somewhere near the back of your list, it is not the worst film ever it has some pretty `stiff' (oo err - playground pun) competition in that department, but it aint a keeper, maybe ok for a rental, but only if you are thinking about lots of voluntary visits to the kitchen/toilet/garden shed/anywhere not near the TV - sorry it is that poor.",1314230400,2,2104,4.089588377723971
3726038,1,B001O2SHM6,I just watched this drivel on hulu and I am so glad I did not pay for it.  The photography was stunning and beautiful but almost every scene was at night or on a cloudy day.  The dialogue was scarce - many minutes of characters walking thru the park or sitting by the ocean not saying anything.  It was very boring in most parts.  The hottest scenes were the lake scene where the 2 men briefly fool around in the water and the ocean/woods scene where Jasper jerks off his friend.  Other than that don't waste your time.,1280275200,9,519,4.255102040816326
3726039,3,B001O2SHM6,"Mark and Jasper were boyfriends, for a short time during their high school years.  Now in their early 20's, they have moved on, but remain friends.  Mark, who identifies as openly gay, is living with Lilly (whom he also dated in high school, but now knows her place as a gay-boy's best friend), while Jasper identifies as heterosexual and is engaged to a girl who is (conveniently) studying in a foreign country.  The three San Francisco residents decide to party together on Halloween - in the Castro, of course - while trying to recreate the chemistry from a high school camping trip to the ""Lost Coast"" area in Northern California. Bad directions from a drug connection, jealousies, repressed desires and regrets for what could have been turn the night into an emotional roller coaster for the trio, in a way that will forever change the nature of their relationship.

The primary focus here is the relative fluidity of sexual desire, not being a matter of black and white, but of infinite shades of gray.  The three friends examine their true feelings for each other, and toward others, as a means of charting the path to the future.  It's a very abstract, sometimes trite and often confusing film. with flashbacks of the camping trip in high school (with the characters all dressed exactly as they are in the present day, the logic for which the director explains in the extras) interspersed with the current action, which consists mostly of what seems like endless slow, methodical wandering the streets and parks of San Francisco. The director also admits he allowed significant improvisation (and it shows), and intentionally left the future of the characters open to interpretation and possible criticism by viewers.  Not an easy film to watch, and - IMO - it just rehashes concepts that are better covered in others.  The acting was one relative bright spot, and it was nice to see some parts of San Francisco that aren't often shown.  Best I can do for this is give it three foggy stars out of five.",1279065600,3,2010,4.786127167630058
3726040,3,B001O2SHM6,"Writer/Director Gabriel Fleming gives us a trio of former high school mates (plus one more who's a tagalong or everyman, perhaps representing we viewers).  They reconnect on a current-day Halloween night in a search for fun and drugs (and old feelings).  While doing so they relive a high school period visit to Northern California's Lost Coast (yes, there is such a place---just look for yourself on Wikipedia).  Making up our little trio we have gay Mark and ""straight"" (ha, ha, ha) Jasper, both in the company of fag-hag-don't-wannabe, Lily, who would give just about anything to convert our Mark to her hetero lifestyle.  Howsomever, little Markey-Mark would love nothing better than to make a reticent (ha, ha, ha) Jasper forget that he (J) is trying way too hard (oh, you don't see that either) to ""be straight.""  Yes, Mark's in love, and his feelings for Jasper are about to do him in.  On the other side of this twosome coin, we have big, confused Jasper who spends at least part of his time, at various stages of the film, writing an email to fiancee, Wendy.  Therein he tries to explain the ""small mistake"" he made in consorting with Mark during their high school days (although, however will he explain his similar behavior during the group's latest seashore visit?).

In his words to Wendy he's very adamant that his past behavior means nothing now (even tho we viewers are witnesses, during this second visit to the Lost Coast, as Jasper both kisses and masturbates Mark).  And while to us actions are stronger than words, perhaps it's his cleaning his cum-covered hand with area sand which throws Mark into an emotional downspin.  So, here we are at film's end, seeing group members go their way, and we're left with a tearful Jasper wondering what the hell his orientation really is. BUT at the same time we do get to listen in as he finishes up his ""forgive me---it meant nothing"" email to an innocently unknowing Wendy.  Wait....wait, there's more.  Thanks to our director in his film's very last frame, who should we see smiling up at us while comfortably reading on a couch, but that sweet looking young woman, herself.....completely unaware that life is about to be ruined by a man who cannot admit what he wants and who he really is.
