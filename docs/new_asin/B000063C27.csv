8698772,4,B000063C27,"The cheapest way to get this DVD, other than buying the box set for $90. The DVD came with no scratches, however it was rolling around in the case. Luckily it didn't get damaged at all, but since it could have gotten damaged, that takes this down to 4 stars. Includes all the episodes from the second season of the show, which is my personal favorite of the show overall. No problems with the disc, but make sure you can view region 2 discs before purchase, because otherwise you cannot watch it. The bonus feature is unfortunately a repeat of 2 of the bonus features from the POPEE the MANIAX DVD that I also own, but that's not the seller's fault obviously. If you are a starting collector of Popee merchandise like me, this is a great buy.",1520726400,,742,4.384057971014493
