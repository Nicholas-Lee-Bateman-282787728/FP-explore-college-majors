6759122,3,B00OPSQ5W0,"For the money it is acceptable.  But for people who have seen a real fire at night it falls short.  The producer has the same problem I have recording a campfire with my digital camera.  Instead of deep red coals and yellowish-orange flame I get pink coals and a white flame.  So it does not look like the real thing to people who know.  One version is cropped close from the bottom of the bottom log to just short of the tips of the highest flames.  The bonus fireplace is not cropped as close, shows the floor of the fireplace and a little of the brickwork on either side of the fire.  The music is acoustic guitar(I think) and is not my instrument of choice for Christmas music.  But face it, everyone has different tastes so put your own music of choice on your stereo while the video plays.

P.S. After writing this review I watched an old episode of Northern Exposure in which there is a scene of a campfire in daylight.  Even their expensive equipment gave pink coals and a white flame.  My conclusion is that all these fireplace videos have the same error of true color.  None the less, I run this video for hours when home.  Often when hearing the crackling of the fire I pause for a moment wondering why I am not feeling the heat of the fire.",1417996800,4,1252,4.299145299145299
6759123,5,B00OPSQ5W0,I love this! The popping of the fire was so realistic we could almost feel the heat! I really like that you can have with or without the music if you desire!! The choice of Christmas music was again perfect!!,1417564800,6,208,4.225
6759124,5,B00OPSQ5W0,Mood maker Christmas Fireplaces creates the perfect ambiance for holiday festivities. I had it playing last week when I hosted book club. The beautiful instrumental Christmas songs got my entire party swaying to the melodic strums of the guitar. This was a real crowd pleaser and gave my fellow book worms a cozy cheery environment. I would recommend this to anyone as it is a wonderful backdrop for any event.,1416182400,6,410,4.871428571428571
6759125,5,B00OPSQ5W0,Beautiful fireplace and music.  A perfect gift for our children who don't have fireplaces!!,1415577600,3,91,5.5
6759126,5,B00OPSQ5W0,"I love the purchase of my Mood Maker Fireplaces DVD. The best thing about it is its versatility. Besides being a Christmas fireplace DVD, It will also serve as a regular (non-holiday) virtual fireplace, which I can use year-round. There are two Christmas fireplaces - one with nice instrumental Xmas music and one with slight holiday decorations, but without music. So, bottom line, the options offered on this DVD make it a wonderful choice if you're shopping for a virtual fireplace this season. Each virtual fireplace is only about 30 minutes long, but that is sufficient because they automatically loop at the end.",1415232000,11,618,5.009708737864078
6759127,5,B00OPSQ5W0,"Don't bother with the others, this is the greatest virtual fireplace you could ever want!  My family has spent hours just mesmerized by the dancing flames and the soft, soul uplifting music that accompanies this fantastic DVD.  You can actually start to smell pine cones and fire, the sensation is so real!!!  We also really enjoy the bonus fireplace, which has a totally different feel, much more romantic, if you know what I mean :)  Overall we were extremely pleased with this product, and proud to support a company that is not afraid to use the word ""Christmas""!  Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow!",1415232000,19,607,4.635514018691588
6759128,1,B00OPSQ5W0,I ended up buying three and did not use either one of them ! They were not what I expected. All you could see was the logs burning! Would have been better if the fire place was in the picture. Wish I had not ordered either one of them!,1485129600,2,235,3.816326530612245

6759130,5,B00OPSQ5W0,"I lost my remote to my DVD player so I wasn't able to play the crackling firewood, but I loved the Christmas music.  I turned out all my lights and just sat and watched to flames and the music.  It was awesome!  Hoping to find a real portable fireplace next year, but in the meanwhile I have this wonderful DVD.  Thanks Mood Makers for making such an enjoyable video.",1484006400,,367,4.27536231884058

6759132,3,B00OPSQ5W0,Torn between giving this one star or five stars!  My son is severely autistic and collects fireplace DVDs. He absolutely loves the visuals of music on this. For that I would give it five stars. The reason I would give it one star is because the menu sticks  switching between fireplaces which frustrates him a great deal. I'm ordering another copy and hopefully this issue does not occur on the second one. Other than that technical glitch of the menu sticking I would say we are completely satisfied.,1483747200,,501,4.681818181818182
6759133,4,B00OPSQ5W0,"Hottest film of the year!
It is a very pleasant back-round if you can't have a real fire. The fire is not cropped so you can see the whole thing. The sound of the fire crackling and popping  makes it seem more real.",1482796800,,215,4.0

8684475,5,B00OPSQ5W0,I love the sound of the crackling fireplaces.  There are three fireplaces to choose from.  One section has the crackling fire with Christmas music.  The other two do not have the music.  One fireplace is decorated for Christmas the other has no decoration.  If you don't have a fireplace - this is the next best thing.
