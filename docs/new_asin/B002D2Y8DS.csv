You see I was there and know exactly what they were talking about. The Heroes of the English Army  had an impossible task to safe 20,000  (40.000 had died already) starving people who were riddled with Lice and were dying of Typush ,TBC and other terrible diseases. No One who was not there could ever imagine the catastrophe.
This film was a stark reminder  what took place in Bergen Belsen 73 years ago.
