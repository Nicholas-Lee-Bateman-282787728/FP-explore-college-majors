7836606,5,6303042813,"One of the all time great movies- keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great cast! Only problem is you can't find this movie on DVD, Netflix or streaming anywhere other than this Laserdisc which I had to borrow to watch (felt like borrowing an 8 track tape player) but quality was good. You will not be disappointed with this movie if you can find it!",1485129600,,350,4.2388059701492535
