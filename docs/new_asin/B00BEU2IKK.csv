8567340,5,B00BEU2IKK,"Easily one of the most heart-wrenching and amazing documentaries I've ever seen. Of course, you have to know who AKB is and why so many of the things in this documentary happened, but if you are aware of AKB (and not sure how you couldn't be if you have even an inkling of interest in Japanese culture), this is THE documentary for you. It's unbelievable to see how much the girls actually struggle under the weight of everything they have to endure in AKB. And when Maeda makes her choice to graduate, it's incredible to not only see her courage in following through with the decision, but to also see how it impacts so many of the girls who were around her, competing for Maeda's spot as the center.
It also breaks your heart to see the penultimate moment so far in AKB's history, when the ultimate ace leaves the group. I can't watch this documentary without crying. Even now, years later, it still hurts to see what AKB has both accomplished and sacrificed. This is a must have documentary, and it's a good reason to learn Japanese if you don't know the language.",1434844800,,1067,4.505154639175258
8567341,5,B00BEU2IKK,"Great Movie! They don't have English subtitles, so you would need to understand Japanese. ( The Japanese is easy to understand. )
They focus mainly on Atsuko Maeda's ''graduation''.",1414454400,2,181,5.275862068965517
