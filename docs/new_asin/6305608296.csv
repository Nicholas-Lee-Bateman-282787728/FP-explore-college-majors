If you also have a chance to see Embrace the Darkness II, the acting was much better in Two.  I would say if you are into this type of movie, then you will not be disapointed",1404259200,,337,4.075757575757576
7892046,2,6305608296,"First this movie is not about vampires that are erotic. See Hammer Horror for that. What this DVD is about is sexpires that unfortunately have to suck blood once in a while. If it wasn't for the blood thing they are saddled with they would just screw like hyper-sexual humans.

Embrace the Darkness they call it? In the title seen the guy seemed to find the darkness in the vaginal area. At the blood bank that guy also seemed to find the darkness in the vaginal area. In fact everyone in this show whether alone or together finds the darkness in the crotch. I thought why not put a little night light in there with the wiring in the basement? Surely everyone could then see the light quicker than they were seeing the dark.

Really though to sell this as a vampire movie is a bit of a stretch. When they want to screw more than all the world this then is a porn movie & goodness its only soft porn at that. That makes it neither good porn nor a good vampire film. Queen of the Damned makes this look like the weak effort it is. Queen of the Damned didn't even get finished as the star of that died. Too bad it didn't happen here. Remember that both movies have the vampire missing mortality & vampires involved with sex themes. It's just that Queen's works. This one doesn't. Don't forget Blade & its sexual themes.

Strangely enough I'm not gonna say this could not have been marketed as a unusual film but it needs a different Title & a different marketing gimmick. Most of the vampire market isn't gonna be impressed by this lame kitten licking milk vampire clan that thinks go for the gnads not go for the throat. This is soft porn & must be aggressively marketed to that crowd. I believe they would have obtained more sales as a result. I'm no prude. I own Caligula & the hardcore version of Alice in Wonderland. I got sick of the reluctant vampire early on & the show went down (pun intended) from there. I could of easily rated this movie one star but the girls are pretty & have erectile tissue in their nipples so we'll raise them (they do have two?) to a two. If you like soft porn this will do you well. If you like tension & evil avoid at all costs.

2 disappointed points ur-ahh Stars!",1266364800,,2199,4.304347826086956
7892047,3,6305608296,"Sex and death are two powerful forces and erotic horror loves to mix the two.  This movie is no exception.
Here we have two vampires.  One is male, calm and careful.  The other is female, wild and dangerous.  They have just moved to LA.  Their personality types clash as she wants only blood from fresh victims (usually those she has had sex with) while he is content with bagged blood from the local blood bank.
Enter a pretty performance artist next door and her reporter ex-boyfriend and you get a fairly typical vampire story where obsession leads to death.
The vampires themselves are a little different.  They can teleport, open doors without touching them and make their clothes jump onto their bodies.
There are lots of sex scenes in this film and plenty of nudity.  Plenty of sex with the vampires and mortals (although most of them are drained in more than one way afterward).
This is an o-kay film with both halves working well.  The acting is pretty good and the cast is attractive.  The DVD has absolutely no special features but at least has tracks.  Again, nothing special, but it is done better than most.",1077753600,4,1121,4.644670050761421
7892048,3,6305608296,"This is a Playboy movie (under the Eros production name) that is best described as a late-night softcore skin fest with a hokey vampire storyline plugged inbetween the steamy love scenes.
The women here are actually quite beautiful, and there are a good number of love scenes here.  Instead of the typical 2 or 3 scenes you might see in a typical Showtime or Cinemax late-night movie, there are about 7 or 8 love scenes here.  At least 1 every 10 minutes, some scenes go for quite a few minutes.
Lots of gratuitous skin showing by the two lead actresses, Madison Clark (who bears a resemblance to actress Mia Sara) as the good girl and Angelia High as the bad girl.
If you're looking for a decent plot or suspense, you won't find it here.  If you want to see a female version of Interview with the Vampire, this movie might fulfill your fetish.
The DVD itself is very barebones, with only a chapter selection as its only menu.",1023235200,6,926,4.4674556213017755
7892049,4,6305608296,"I don't ask for much in a vampire movie --- vampires who aren't messy eaters, some kind of romantic connection between sex and vampirism (it's central to the myth, really), and characters that make some kind of sense.  On most counts, ""Embrace the Darkness"" succeeds.  Admittedly, it is more about T&A than vampirism, but it succeeds in that genre too.  As for the babes ... to each his own, but to my way of thinking, two or three of the most beautiful women ON THE PLANET are in this movie.",1001203200,2,492,4.444444444444445
7892050,3,6305608296,"Should have known by the Playboy label that this would be a fizzer. Yes, its full of gorgeous ladies, but with a lame plot and poor acting. In fact, if it wasn't for the talent (and I don't mean acting) it barely would have  scratched 1 star. So if you like alot of T&A with your neck biting (you  sick puppy), then this might just be for you.",949881600,12,343,4.029411764705882
