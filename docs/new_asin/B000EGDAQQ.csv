8109028,3,B000EGDAQQ,"Sure, you could probably grab ROBO VAMPIRE for a few quarters in a dollar store but being able to get it on a double feature with its ""sequel"" DEVIL'S DYNAMITE is a major score. BCI's Eastern Horror line was awesome and though I was initially surprised that they would release these two terrible moves on disc, I realize now we'll probably never see this kind of quality put into them again. What a shame.

ROBO VAMPIRE and DEVIL'S DYNAMITE are epically bad. They're not ""so bad they're good,"" they're just BAD, and I love them anyhow. Action, robots, vampires, Godfrey Ho...it's all insanity. If you've never seen either of these films, you will be disappointed, seriously disappointed. Trash fans, on the other hand, are going to love these, if they haven't already seen them.",1374710400,2,778,4.8059701492537314
8109029,2,B000EGDAQQ,"I am thankful I read the reviews before watching the film.  Watching the film without the reviews would result in mass confusion.  Reading the reviews first makes the film watchable.  For example, one scene a white woman with blonde hair jumps out the window but through the window a short dark skinned man with a mustach and grey wig comes through the window and then changes back to the woman.  Put it in slow motion and it is great.  So many other classic scenes that are only good if you know they are coming.  Vampires hop like bunnies until they fight.  Movie is two movies spliced into one so the transition of scenes make no sense.  A side character who we really have little to no information on becomse the robo cop.  He somehow has jedi powers in scenes where he uses the force to obtain his weapon.  If you can find it for $2 or less get it.  If not, avoid.",1157068800,3,869,4.302469135802469
8109030,1,B000EGDAQQ,"If you like bad movies, laughably bad movies, then robovampire is a film for you. It is simultaneously a good, bad, and downright ugly film. However, if you have seen robovampire and are looking for another film like it, devils dynamite will disappoint. I would suggest catman: lethal track, it is not quite the exhibition of poor film making that robovampire manages to be but it has its moments. In conclusion, I suggest buying robovampire by itself if possible.",1154304000,2,464,4.886075949367089
