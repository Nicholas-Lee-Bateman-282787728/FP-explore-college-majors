4647856,4,B005BUA1JE,"I am ecstatic that CatDog is going to see a proper release on DVD! It is about time, as with the other Nickelodeon shows that Shout! Factory has been releasing. I can't wait to buy this, but I do have a small gripe, and I'm sure you all know what that is. Shout! Factory has been really good at releasing full seasons of the Nicktoons that they have rights to, and even a double season release with The Angry Beavers. Awesome! But with CatDog, they have decided to release only Part 1 of the first season. I contacted the fine folks over at Shout! Factory, and I was told that the reason why they chose to split CatDog up into two parts for this release is because they wanted to keep their sets at a lower price so the big stores (Best Buy, Walmart, etc.) are able to sell them better. Apparently, their thinking is that if the sets are cheaper, people will be more willing to pick them up, and the big box stores will be more willing to put them on display. That is a fair enough explanation. I'm guessing this release will be an experiment, and if this sells better than some of the full season releases that were priced slightly higher, then this is probably the format they will continue to use for future season releases. If you think about it, this set is about $15, whereas a full season for, say, Hey Arnold is somewhere around $20. If Part 1 and a later Part 2 of CatDog are released, that will be around $30 for the first season. I guess that means more money for Shout! Factory and more out of my wallet. That's too bad, but then again, it has been so long in waiting for proper releases of shows like CatDog that I am more than willing to pay a few extra dollars to own the show. Now, hopefully Shout! Factory will eventually release the entire series' for the shows they have already started, and maybe they will eventually be able to attain some other shows, like Rocket Power or Rugrats. I can't wait to buy this DVD set!",1317340800,9,1937,4.295081967213115

I have lived through them all from Muppet Babies in 1989 to present plus my own beloved Bugs Bunny and wily Coyote from years gone by. I love CATDOG  and JAKERS.

4647873,5,B005BUA1JE,"For those of you that aren't familiar with this show, here's a basic summary:
CatDog is about a pair of conjoined twins. Cat, the smart and sophisticated one. Dog the happy go lucky, but not so smart or sophisticated one. Other characters include:
The bully Greaser dogs Cliff, Lube, and Shirek
Eddie the Squirrel, who wants to be a Greaser
Rancid Rabbit who apparently works at every place in Nearburg and in most episodes is the antagonist
Winslow the mouse who lives in CatDog's walls and likes to harass them
Mr. Sunshine who doesn't appear to have any emotions and speaks in a monotone voice
Mervis and Dunglap, CatDog's friends
Randolph, the rich, trendy, and suave cat
I grew up watching this show and since I started buying all the sets, it has become one of my favorites once again. Thank you Shout! Factory for finally releasing this on dvd! Shows like this have been long overdue for a dvd release. However, I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a laugh-per minute show. Every so often, there is something funny, but again, not  a laugh per minute show. I like this show because I like the characters. Dog especially. He's a kid at heart and I like characters like that. He and Cat have great chemistry. So if you're like me and you like shows where you like the characters, then in my opinion, this is worth adding to your collection.",1351382400,2,1356,4.603305785123967

4647878,5,B005BUA1JE,"It's kind of funny... when I was offered the chance to review Catdog, I was thinking ""It's a cartoon! That won't fit on my blog.""  Then as I was about to log off my email, a voice behind me said ""Catdog!  I love that show!  Mom, you have to get it!""

My youngest kids are 12 and 8 years old... so they've actually only seen a couple of re-runs of Catdog.  On the other hand, my oldest kids grew up watching it and have, I'm sure, seen every episode ever made.  So in our family, as the saying goes... ""Everything old is new again!""

I miss some of the older cartoons and prefer many of them over what is on today.  My kids love watching them and some, like Catdog, actually have a moral to them.  We enjoyed it!
