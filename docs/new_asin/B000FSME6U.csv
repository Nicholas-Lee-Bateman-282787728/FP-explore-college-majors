2584327,5,B000FSME6U,"Culloden: 3.5 stars out of 4
The Bottom Line:

An innovative, engaging, and informative documentary on a battle that most viewers will not be familiar with, Culloden zips through its brief running length but leaves the viewer with a very good idea about the Battle of Culloden and makes valid points about the death of the clan system; it's a film any history buff will enjoy.

The War Game: 3.5 stars out of 4
The Bottom Line:

The only non-documentary to win the Oscar for Best Documentary feature, The War Game is a 48 minute long speculative piece on what would happen to Britain in the event of a minor nuclear attack, and it's absolutely fascinating; even more so than in Culloden, Watkins showcases that he can make indelible images on shoestring budget, and he makes The War Game into quite a film.",1243209600,,806,4.6223776223776225
2584328,4,B000FSME6U,"The Wargame, made in the mid-1960s, dealt with the prospect of a major nuclear strike on the UK. In its depiction of the effects and consequences of using these weapons it quite rightly pulls no punches. However, I would take issue with premise that it was all OUR fault. The Russians were lobbing their nukes at us because we had the temerity to arm ourselvs with our own deterrent, ie the V-Force of Vulcan, Victor and Valiant bombers, thus, so the argument went, making us a target. Just why the Russians would resort to such apocalyptic measures knowing the response would be their own inevitable destruction was never explored. I think the film was very well made, believable in its depiction of the transition to war and then the effects of that war, but at the same time I felt it was rather biased in the usual left-wing ""blame the west"" manner, ala CND. I think the other nuclear horror story ""Threads"" was more balanced in its presentation, and all the MORE terrifying for it.",1225324800,2,986,4.64
2584329,5,B000FSME6U,"I first saw these ""documentaries"" 40+ years ago and was impressed by their power and the logic of their messages. Seeing the programmes now is to lament the demise of powerful, committed and issue dominated documentary film making appearing on our TV screens. The War Game & Culloden haven't lost their ability to shock and stimulate debate.

Culloden, with its Vietnam war sub-text, carries, now, a message about decisions to declare war in Iraq while the War Game reminds us that policies of MAD & WMD are based on faulty logic.

This DVD is worth many viewings.",1178928000,4,564,4.804123711340206
2584330,5,B000FSME6U,"""The War Game"" is a surprisingly effective documentary, especially for the time that it was released. I felt that it was actually more haunting than ""Threads"", due to its colder atmosphere of hard facts and ebony and ivory images of charred bodies and demolished edifices. I often found ""Threads"" to actually be somewhat of a disappointment, especially with the initial attack scenes and cinematography that REALLY looks dated--especially for a movie that was made in--1984?!?! (Looking more like it was made in the early 70's in many spots). ""The War Game"", I felt, did a better job at hitting you with both fists--especially without any element of a ""standard British kitchen sink drama"" that ""Threads"" contained. Don't get me wrong, I still feel ""Threads"" is a good film, but one that could have been better, especially in light of how brutally honest ""The War Game"" was with its theme. Overall, I will always feel that when it comes to nuke films, ""The Day After"", does it best, due to its extremely chilling atmosphere and convincing performances. Also, contrary to what people have said, ""The Day After"" is NOT a soap opera with nukes, nor is it ""Mister Roger's Neighborhood"" as some reviewers of ""Threads"" have mentioned, but a HIGHLY effective thriller and a bona fide wake-up call. In conclusion, for me ""The Day After"" is the best, but second in line is ""The War Game"" with its bona fide chilling effectiveness. Definitely worth a viewing.",1172707200,3,1449,4.918367346938775
2584331,5,B000FSME6U,"a double bill of films made for bbc-tv, i had seen both of these some thirty years back and never got over them. the earlier of them, ""culloden"" is a recreation of the events leading up to and following the 1746 battle that spelled the final end of scotlands days as a seperate country from england. adapted from the classic book by john prebble (incidentally, the rabbits favorite book), the film is a brilliant reflection on the conflicts among the idiotic bonnie prince charlie and his advisors, the ruthless english army, and the average scottish soldieer caught in the crossfire. filmed on a minimal budget (they had ONE cannon!), the battle scenes are so creative that you will believe you're part of it. this was the old walter cronkite ""you are there"" concept taken to the heights of art. now as to ""the war game"" -- well, once watkins had a major surprise hit on his hands with ""culloden"", he got to make ""war games"". akin to the similar path of patrick mcgoohan a few years later, who followed up the overwhelming success of ""secret agent"" with the artistically brilliant but controversial ""the prisoner"", watkins shot his wad with ""WG"", and never recovered. this fantasy about an english town in the days leading up to and following a nuclear attack is far more frightening than any of the myriad of other films which have used the same conceit. its matter-of-factness and use of ordinary people in lieu of actors works in watkins's hands in a manner that would have been artsy in the hands of another director. the finished product proved so controversial that the bbc declined to air it, and the movie was ultimately released in theaters, where ironically it won an oscar as best documentary. as i said previously, i saw both films on television in the 70s -- back when pbs still carried out its mandate to air quality television, rather than wayne dyer infomercials or doo-wop retrospectives. i cant more heartily recommend a dvd to watch than this.",1165190400,22,1963,4.742690058479532
2584332,4,B000FSME6U,Remember that in 1965 we were in an intense cold war with the Soviet Union. It seems quaint now but is shot as a news story with immediancy to it. The documentary feel gives it life. We lived with the possibility of nuclear annilation always in the back of our collective minds. This film gives short shrift to Her Majesty's government's lack of preparation or the ignorance of the people affected by a nuclear attack on Britain. England is a small country & one wonders how indeed we would react in the U.S. to a nuclear attack with all our wide open spaces & places to escape.  This movie gives the Soviets the benefit of moral relativism. Maybe U.S. foreign policy is responsible for this attack. It was totally devoid of references to God by the victims which is unrealistic but still refreshing. It's documentary feel made it seem like it could happen this way. The interviews with victims & government representative was effective & I suspect much more so 42 years ago.,1161820800,5,975,4.635838150289017
2584333,5,B000FSME6U,"The War Game is one of the best films about Nuclear War. I first saw a snippet of this on the documentary Cold War and own the VHS copy. In general, these types of stories typically have 3 basic parts: pre-attack, the attack and post attack. Of the movies made in this genre, The War Game is the strongest in dramatizing all 3 parts.  What helps the War Game along is that we do not get attached to any one character (my version is only 50 minutes long) like you do in the rest of the movies in this genre.  When you attempt to follow the fate of one character or a group of people, you can lose the larger societal implications of nuclear war effects.

Some contrasts: First, there are 2 other major movies that are part of this genre called Threads and The Day After.  Threads was a British movie.  The Day After was its American counterpart. Both are decent stories but I would give Threads some advantage here.

1)  Threads does the best job with showing pre-attack and attack conditions starting from the basic bliss of most people to the terrifying attack.

2) The movie the Day After shows a good deal of the pre-attack and post attack conditions but it gets carried away with the attack situation.  Its characters are very shallow and detract from an otherwise well-told story.

One of The War Game's  flaws is its obvious scoffs at religion. Many of the quotes seem to suggest that American ministers are backward and stupid for making suggestions like not giving shelter space to the passing stranger.  What a modern viewer may not understand is how close the US and the USSR came to nuclear annihilation during this time frame and how practical this advice really was.

The War Game's other obvious flaw is its creating moral relativism with the Soviets.  The movie portrays the fact that the US and its NATO allies may have been the first to use nuclear weapons in a battle over the Fulda Gap in Germany (a likely hotspot).  What the story does not explain is how the Soviets had such a large and menacing conventional presence in Eastern Europe (and the Western Europe's inability or lack of desire to take on its own defense) caused this to become part of our policy.  The War Game also fails to explain how the Soviet sub fleet went from being a coastal defence force to an offensive force in rapid order with reactors and weapon systems extremely prone to accident (as evidenced by the greater number of subs lost in the Soviet fleet than in the American fleet).  These factors did a great deal to de-stabilize Western Europe for some time.",1159747200,3,2556,4.545851528384279
2584334,5,B000FSME6U,"Watch this and after ask yourself how two films made in 1964 and 1965 are many times more powerful than most of the drivel you saw during this decade.  The western world was during forty years scared to death with the idea of nuclear war but accepted it as a possibility.  After ""The War Game"" and ""Culloden"", you will doubt also the reasons for the current war ""on terror"".",1158451200,14,374,4.405797101449275
2584335,5,B000FSME6U,"Why it has taken all this time for these two films to make it to the US in DVD form is a story that I hope comes out.  Peter Watkins is finally being ackowledged in the US for his radical, truly independent vision, what with the release in the last two years of Punishment Park and The Gladiators.  But it is here, in his first two feature films, that he is arguably at his best.  The War Game is a horrifying recreation, done in documentary style, of what the effects of nuclear war would be.  It may not have the impact it had when it was first released in 1964 as the US and the Soviet Union had their fingers on the button that would have assured, as the film so disturbingly shows (so disturbingly that the BBC, who commissioned the film, refused to show it and it was effectively banned in England for years after), mutual destruction.  Nonetheless, the threat of nuclear warfare has not totally disappeared from the radar screen, so the film still carries relevance.  Culloden, which predates The War Game, is perhaps the more contemporary and frightening film.  Here, Watkins introduces for the first time in a feature length piece his ""you-are-there"" technique, as participants in the Scottish uprising against Britain in the mid-eighteenth century are interviewed as though news and camera men existed at this time.  Both films reek with realism, as they are acted by non-professionals; and in the case of Culloden, the grime and sweat of eighteenth century life and the ferocity and brutality of combat at this time comes across as though, indeed, cameras were available at this time.  Watkins is clearly aghast at what people can do to each other, and Culloden, culminating with the massacre of the Scottish clans by the better armed and more ruthless British military, clearly, as Watkins himself as said, is another way of looking at what was occuring and would continue to occur in Vietnam.  Today, with another war, the film retains its power and relevancy.  These are not easy films to watch: they are no doubt one sided and pedantic: yet they speak to a time when filmmakers were willing to alienate and confound in order to make what they felt was a difference: a time when the idea of popular film instigating change, naive as it may be, felt possible.",1153958400,66,2272,4.697732997481109
2584336,4,B000FSME6U,The War Game was Very interesting. Culloden was shocking and very educational,1417564800,,77,5.5

2584338,5,B000FSME6U,"2 great films,  I only with Peter Watkins made more films in this style!

The war game was banned from tv for years and its quite harrowing to watch but well worth it.

I mostly bought this dvd for Culloden which i watched at school and didn't really grasp the full message until now.  A brilliant ""documentary"" about the battle of Culloden in Scotland.",1398643200,,353,4.46875
2584339,5,B000FSME6U,"The War Game is a harrowing and disturbing account of the aftermath of a nuclear hydrogen bomb attack on Kent, UK.  It gives the lie to the British Government propaganda of the day, mid 1960's, that one could survive a nuclear war. Whilst it is a work of fiction, it uses actual and well documented events that happened in WWII, from the 1000 bomber raids over Germany which led to fire storms, the most infamous of which was Dresden, to the aftermath of the two atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

This is not an easy film to watch, and is certainly not for the squeamish. It is only around 45 minutes long, but into this it packs a massive punch. The British Government of the day thought the British public should not see it, and it was banned from being screened for 20 years until  1985, such was the power of its message.

This is probably the most thought provoking film on a war that, fortunately, has not happened and one must sincerely hope it never does.

The War Game is paired with Culloden, dealing with a specific period in Anglo-Scottish history and is, therefore, limited in its audience appeal.  This is another triumph in the documentary style of Watkins and deals with the subject from the perspectives of those who fought in the battle from the lowliest to the highest in rank.

There are two prints of this release. One by the British Film Institute, and the other on a Region 1 DVD from the US. I went for the US release as the print is marginally cleaner. The DVD has superb liner notes looking into the history and making of The War Game with many insights into the machinations of Government, Churchill's involvement, and the climb down by the BBC, all of which led to the delay in the film being shown to the public.  Given this, and the pressures on Watkins, it is a marvel itself that the film was ever completed.

If you have the stomach for it, this is a must see film. And it is most certainly likely to change your view on a nuclear war being ""winnable"".",1384560000,2,2000,4.442622950819672

2584341,5,B000FSME6U,These are the two most powerful films I have ever seen in a long life (& I've seen thousands).  They will alter your view of the world for ever.

2584342,4,B000FSME6U,"A chilling pseudo-documentary dedicated to the measures England had in place to deal with nuclear attacks during the cold war era. Framed as a newscast interspersed with short, stern-faced lectures and quotes from the experts, it's a brutally honest glimpse into the horrors that were looming around every corner. Since it is, at heart, a public service film, it falls into a few of the associated traps - a low budget, obviously staged setups, a flood of monotone speakers glaring directly into the camera - but the unflinching approach it takes to such a powerful, intense subject excuses most of those shortcomings. By no means a party picture, it's still a fascinating look into how poorly prepared humanity was (and still is) for the mutual destruction its nations were flirting with, almost playfully, at the time. Chillingly effective, alarmingly grounded and hauntingly vivid - our trigger-happy national leaders could stand a modern viewing, lest the concept of nuclear war become too abstract.",1329436800,,1003,5.197530864197531
2584343,4,B000FSME6U,I saw Culloden when I was kid and really liked it. This is the first time I've seen it in almost 40 years and it was better than I remember. There was a delivery hiccup but it was a problem at the post office and not with the vendor. Thanks!,1323129600,,241,3.84
2584344,5,B000FSME6U,"Two Peter Watkins films here, pioneering examples, perhaps, of what we now call ""mockumentaries"", documentary-style films of fictional events (here, ""The War Game"") or past, you-are-there events (Culloden).

As for ""The War Game,"" although it's very much a work from the Cold War era (1965) it's still effective in spite of, or perhaps because of, it being black-and-white, gritty, short in running time, and focused on a small part of a pre- and post-attack Britain. I've seen ""Testament,"" ""Threads,"" and ""The Day After"" and this seems more effective -- and more graphic -- and while the other three nuclear-attack films show a story, ""The War Game"" is more immediate. You are watching society coming apart in almost real time, and it's scary.

I differ from other reviewers in that I find that ""Culloden"" seems to have aged well, if you accept 1964 state-of-the art news media in 1745 as a premise. Given the few actors, and some clever camera angles, the story manages to suggest fragmentary and smoke-shrouded parts of the battle as believable (in a battle that involved 15,000 men in real life). No spectacle, just confusion and the sort of narrow field-of-vision that those caught in such a battle would see, with the participants talking to the camera as the battle unfolds, horribly wrong. The Greek-chorus commentary on the pre-battle failures on the Scottish side does not take away from the story, rather, the viewer is watching an unfolding and inevitable tragedy. Nor does the film neglect the post-battle search-and-destroy by the victorious British forces, in many ways as harrowing as the battle. And you learn something of the participants, famous or not, Scottish, British and Irish (they were there, too, as you see).

Highest recommendation for those with an interest in British/Scottish or cinematic history.",1321142400,9,1829,5.130872483221476
2584345,4,B000FSME6U,"The film is interspersed with staged events and archival footage from the Second World War, and seamlessly edited. Rather crude special effects, such as shaking the camera to simulate the winds of a firestorm, are surprisingly effective. Traditional documentary techniques like maps, scrawled epigraphs of information and quotes from civic leaders, recitations of nave quotes from public figures, man on the street interviews that show the ignorance of average Brits to nuclear war and civil defense (not knowing the effects of Carbon 14- would you or I?), as well as some yahoo and gung ho American military sorts, are very effective, as well, even if a bit over the top re: American enthusiasm for war (but, recall, this was only a few years after Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb was a hit, and showed reckless American militarism at its worst). The narration by Michael Aspel and Peter Graham is also very effective at conveying the faux realism of this horror film's fictive world, in impassive tones, as well as showing how utterly deluded civil defense measures were, then and retrospectively. Given the spate of nuclear Armageddon films made in the 1960s, and up through the early 1980s miniseries The Day After, it's remarkable how such a low budget effort like The War Game retains its effectiveness when almost all other films on the topic seem corny. It's likely that the reason the film retains its punch is the very reason it was banned for nearly two decades. Scenes of British police shooting civilians (rioters, two men who kill a police officer for food, and also shooting civilians to put them out of immediate post-blast misery) were too much for the still pre-Vietnam War era public. Also, the film's `realism' and unflinching look at the utter inability of the U.K. government to protect its citizens from an attack, much less handle the response of survivors after an attack, was sure to cause waves.

  When the film was delayed for broadcast, Watkins resigned from the BBC, which was pressured into private screenings for public officials. Many officials denounced the film as anti-British agitprop, until one of the few instances where a critic played a positive role arose. Noted film and drama critic Kenneth Tynan championed the film as possibly the most important film ever made, which spearheaded a letter writing campaign by anti-nuke forces, which forced the film into limited theatrical release on college campuses across Europe and America in 1966.

  Much of the information about a nuclear strike was cannily accurate for its day, if limited. This was pre-the idea of nuclear winter, so most of the information wa staken from reported effects of the two atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the fire bombings of Tokyo, Dresden, and other Japanese and German cities. The effectiveness of the `extras' in makeup (some with severe deformity and scarring) is jolting, but made ever more `realistic' by the film being in black and white. Interestingly, some of the vox populi interviews pull back from the diegetic tale of nuclear horror, to ask real life Britons whether or not the U.K. should retaliate against the USSR in such a scenario, and most unstintingly agree their nation should. This is a nice contrast to some of the intertitle sequences that show often hilariously nave comments by British officials written out in full. A voiceover intones, near film's end, that by 1980, the chances of such a scenario playing out at least once in the world is very high. That it never did is something to seriously pause over, for, despite the film's accuracy in depicting social and governmental inadequacies in responding to such an attack, as well as its accuracy in claiming over a third of all Britons would die from the attacks or their aftermath, it has to be acknowledged that the film also grossly understates the human will to survive, and whatever role that played at keeping the Cold War nuclear powers at bay for nearly half a century. Still, even though the film is technically a mockumentary (however un-Christopher Guest-like), it can be argued as a documentary, also, since it so perfectly captures its era's zeitgeist without severely dating itself. It's really a rare film, in all respects.

  And, aside from its exposure of Cold War Civil Defense failures, the film also slyly comments on the media of the day, and its failings, especially in its depiction of the classism of that era. One wonders if any documentary done today could as readily capture the true and false beliefs we now have of global warming, Islamic terror, the international financial crisis, etc. Regardless, The War Game is a terrific film, and a great documentary- innovative and deep. I recommend its rediscovery to all who want to know what art and journalism can do, if far too rarely.",1282780800,2,4885,4.962102689486553

8126248,5,B000FSME6U,"Peter Watkins made the extraordinary look easy when it came to his craft of making films. The Battle of Culloden was made for TV in 1964 and reconstructed the last battle on British soil and put modern cameras there to film and interview the main players. It is gripping from start to finish with actors all above their game and a script that is as sharp as it is informative and accurate. A truly moving account of a terrible battle that marked the end of the Highland Clan system and the loss of so many lives.

I remember seeing this on the BBC some years ago and it was a fairly poor print  this however is excellent and once again this is thanks to the BFI. This has been coupled with the much more controversial The War Game which has always proven to be very hard to track down. Made the year after it is a docu  drama about a thermo nuclear attack on Britain and uses available information to chronicle a possible outcome or outcomes for what is left of the survivors.

Once again the acting is all exceptional and everyone is believable in a very unfamiliar setting. It was supposed to be shown on the BBC but they deemed it to be too intense for the public. So it went on theatrical release and won the Oscar for best documentary. It is absolutely stark and probably did a lot to get more people to recognise the sheer futility of nuclear war and the evil that such weapons represent. I was transfixed for the entire running time and felt it still has the power to move and shock today.

8126249,4,B000FSME6U,"Your watching a fictional biography where a reporter is interviewing people before and after a nuclear strike in an English town in 1965.
Its ok given being desensitized by post 9/11 and watching Threads and the The Day After in 1984 as a teenager. It does mention current events such as Vietnam,LBJ interestingly.

One Of the scenes where people were moved to people's houses and the women asked the cop if the people are ""colored"". I had to roll my eyes up at that stupid girl's comment, but that was the behavior at that time.

But keeping in mind this was 1965, not long after the Cuban missile crisis, this film would freak anyone out. It's less than an hour long. There's much commentary between scenes with a reporters interviewing civilians like a documentary but the reporter was also acting.

It was hard to take seriously this film because the actresses'  hair seemed to be exempted from any radiation let alone dirt in some scenes. YouTube personality Tommy Sotomayor's takes on black women's obsession with weave would have a field day with this one.

But actors, actresses and writers did their homework to capture the pompous ignorance of the civilized before the catastrophe then the raw emotion of the destress, despair and horror and how civil defense is pointless. With the exception of the hair issue, it's a black and white short version of Threads. But it was well-written with the all the intense camera angles at that which are common today.

8126252,4,B000FSME6U,"Nobody remembers forgotten filmmaker Peter Watkins, but these two docudrama relics from 1964 are worth a look.  ""The War Game"" dramatizes the effects a nuclear attack would have had on Britain had it actually occurred in the early 60's, at the height of the cold war between the Soviet Union and the West.  One of the uncomfortable facts was that the British government had a very confusing policy of evacuating urban populations and forcibly boarding them into suburban and rural homes.  One particular couple was expected to house eight people during an emergency.  The incredible measures were deemed necessary because the densely populated island nation feared total devastation in a third world war. A very interesting and frightening nostalgic look back at yesterday.

""Culloden"" is even more fascinating, as the modern news interview approach of covering the 1745 Stuart rebellion puts a new twist on history.  All the prejudices and hatred come glaringly out, as this was the last attempt of Catholics to seize the throne of protestant England.  We find out that many of the Highland peasants were forced to fight by their misguided clan chiefs, and that the leaders, including Bonnie Prince Charlie himself, knew their rabble force was no match for the superior English army.  And the subsequent brutal occupation left scars for generations.  Definitely not a schoolbook version of an historical event.",1421020800,4,1411,5.207964601769912
