8021640,4,B00023M30A,I wish I had a dollar for every time my son has asked me to watch this video. When our library cycled it out of the stacks we had to purchase our own copy.,1471219200,,155,3.588235294117647
8021641,5,B00023M30A,"I'm not sure why it's so compelling to watch a guy and gal in firefighter gear somewhat loudly and overemphatically explain how trains work to a group of kids who yell out ""cool"" at unpredictable intervals, but it's good watching. The show is unevenly produced, and that's part of the charm. There's no pretense here. Our 2 and 5 year olds both adore this video, having watched it about 60 times in the last month.",1257984000,,414,4.533333333333333
8021642,5,B00023M30A,"Last Christmas, we bought our Grandson the Firefighter George Firetruck series because he loves firetrucks. He hasn't stopped watching them, so we were encouraged to ""please buy something different so we can stop watching this video""! I figured we would get the same result with the firefighter Train and we were right on. We also purchased the airplane video. Next year we will be buying the rest of the collection on trains.

These videos are not only quirky and high energy for a child's attention, they are extemely educational. If your child loves trains, this is a must for you.",1231200000,,584,4.84
8021643,5,B00023M30A,"Wow do we love firefighter George at our house. My 2 year old can't get enough of this video. I think this is the best of the Start Smarter series, though all are really superior to most children's videos. This one about trains has lots of exciting footage of big trains blowing whistles and going through tunnels. They even show you animals getting on an off a circus train, which gets my son yelling with excitement. The safety bits are delivered in very concrete, easy to understand language that even my little one understands (the proof being in the pudding, when we last rode a mini train he lectured me on how we should stay ""FAR FAR away from the tracks""). Very well done.",1216080000,,680,4.491935483870968
8021644,5,B00023M30A,"My 2 1/2 year old LOVES this DVD and all the others in the series, too.  He watches them over and over and has learned a lot about trains and train safety (and so have I).  He actually sits down and watches this from start to finish (not easy for a 2 year old!) Firefighter George is now one of his favorite people.  I also recommend the Firefighter George & The FSU Circus Teach Nutrition DVD.  My son is learning about the foods that are healthy and has actually eaten more fruits and vegetables because of this DVD.  It's a great series for kids.",1197244800,,549,4.240384615384615
8021645,5,B00023M30A,Wonderful DVD for the Train enthusiast.  The whole Firefighter George series are very well done and informative.  My five-year old Grandson loves them.  He wore out his video tapes so I bought him DVD replacements.,1174176000,,214,5.057142857142857
8021646,4,B00023M30A,"will buy more from this series!  Production quality is not the very best - but still good enough to captivate my 2.5 yr old.  He loves seeing the trains up close and we also have the Firefighter George steam trains dvd.  Parts of this dvd are above his age level (the dvd IS divided into sections for younger and older ""junior engineers"") but he loves the chapter about the really long circus train and seeing the elephants and animals get off and on the train.  (That section is much too short we have to replay it over and over!)  and he loves the sections describing all the different types of cars on a train especially the caboose section (cant figure why thats his favorite!) But we get daily ""wanna watch the caboose, mama!"" requests.  I hope he will also grow into the ""older junior engineers"" sections of this dvd - and I'm sure this will continue to be a favorite in our house for awhile...",1142208000,3,900,4.424242424242424
8021647,5,B00023M30A,"My sister-in-law sent this DVD for my son's 3rd birthday earlier this month.  He loves trains and wanted to watch this DVD right away.  He sat the entire time (which is unusual for him), transfixed by the ""mighty trains"" and the super enthusiastic host, Firefighter George.  The DVD teaches children about mighty trains including diesel locomotives, different types of freight cars, cabooses, electric trains, the circus train and passenger trains.  The DVD also talks about safety around trains such as looking both ways before crossing train tracks and keeping a safe distance from passing trains. My son has picked up a lot of information about trains from watching this DVD - more than I could have taught him about trains!  It has quickly become his favorite movie to watch.",1140220800,3,779,5.007751937984496
