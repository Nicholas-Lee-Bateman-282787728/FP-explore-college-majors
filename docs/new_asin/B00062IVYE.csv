However, if he had bothered to really review this entire program he would have realized that the booklet, which, I understand, is included with the purchase of the VHS tape and is, also, in the DVD subdirectory \Extras\TAB is all ANY beginner needs to learn the beginning steps to playing mandolin.

Like most of Huckabees tapes and DVD's it is quite good at teaching a willing student...even one that feels limited in their abilities. If one has ANY adequate desire to really learn they can begin with the mandlin here.  Start with fifteen minutes of practice TWICE per day and pretty soon you won't even notice how long you practice.  Within one year you should be playing with a few friends.  Just DO IT!  Trust me on this.",1198108800,,808,4.576388888888889
8037005,3,B00062IVYE,"The DVD would not run in my DVD player but it would on my PC's DVD player. On my computer screen the resolution was pretty poor. I could not see the strings Dan was playing - also partly because he is holding his bass somewhat sideways. You will also hear airplanes taking off during his lessons. Mmmm, would you record music in a place like that? However, the content of the DVD is surely complete. You'll start with scales and go from there. Pretty dry really especially compared to the Murphy method which does work on my Tv's player and also is better presented.

The first section could have been better by taking the video of the tripod.

My recommendation would be to get several videos on paying bass and if you want to start playing pretty much right out of the box the Murphy method is going to get you there first, but the are lots of things on this video that are not covered on the Murphy video so get both.",1191974400,,920,4.312138728323699
8037006,2,B00062IVYE,"The first third of this is a useful intro to the instrument, covering the basics of how to hold the pick and so on. But when it comes to the songs its just a run through at speed, not broken down in a way that helps you learn. If you're an intermediate to advanced and want to see how somebody else plays these song it might be useful, but beginners will just be frustrated by the speed. It takes most people a while to get to that level, and if you're already there you probably don't need the first half of this video that tells you how to hold the instrument, so its really not a good value for the money. Try either the Casey or Cochran videos instead.",1107043200,3,656,4.093023255813954
