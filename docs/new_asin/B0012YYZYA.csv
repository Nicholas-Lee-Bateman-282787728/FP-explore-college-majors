8248538,5,B0012YYZYA,"The DVD Planet Earth, Vol. 1 arrived in less than a week from the date of purchase, and arrived in the best of conditions.  I was completely blown away with the HD and sound clarity that over came my home.",1255996800,6,205,4.125
8248539,5,B0012YYZYA,"As someone who enjoys photography I certainly enjoyed the spectacular views provided by Planet Earth.  The dedication by the photographers to capture not only the scenery of our planet but the wildlife brings the viewer into a portion of the planet not visited by many.  If ""arm chair"" traveling is the only way you have to see the world about you, then this series is only way to go!",1254096000,8,384,4.550724637681159
8248540,5,B0012YYZYA,"I love the Planet Earth series.  Since it was too expensive for me to buy the entire series, I bought disc 1 because it includes ""From pole to pole"" which is summarization of the entire series and has some spectacular photographing.  If you really love this series but are unsure about dropping $50+, get this.  It'll satisfy you.",1238976000,12,330,4.655172413793103
