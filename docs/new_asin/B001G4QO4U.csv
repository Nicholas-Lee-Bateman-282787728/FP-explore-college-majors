8303772,4,B001G4QO4U,"A classic actor that portrays a bad guy role very entertainingly. The film stars Vinod Khanna whom i was not that much a fan of but he did do some good acting in this film. Shutrungh Sinha is a actor i always hated apart from Amitabh movies he co starred in and Khudgarz. After watching this film, i have to be honest and say he can do comedy and is not that bad of a actor when he wants to be. Zeenat Aman is a talented actress and is very sexy and beautiful in this film. This film is like a comedy love triangle between the three stars, with a lot of humour, action and some good family melodrama added in. The movie is about the two thief buddies who find a little girl whom they consider will bring them fortune as she is a rich mans daughter and later bond with. This is a good film",1304985600,,788,4.025477707006369
