8537404,1,B0097CT4AE,"I was deeply disappointed in this dvd. I have 2 othr Leerburg dvds and they were great but this one is a 1990 video showing ""Schutzhund testing NOT an word about how they get to this  stage. The dvd offers nothing about training and is dated and should be avoided. Why Leerburg has this still for sale is beyond me and makes me weary of buying anymore from them.",1404950400,,362,4.246376811594203
