2354764,4,B000A34580,"Henry's ""National Treasures"" is a rather comprehensive product

concerning symbols etc. If you are familiar with masonic art

and symbols you will not find so much new stuff, but the DVD is

still very interesting and professional.",1168819200,13,231,5.1891891891891895
2354765,4,B000A34580,"William Henry's ""National Treasures"" is a surprisingly informative work on American founding fathers symbols. Symbols such as the bald eagle (which represents the spiritual principal and was associated with the Goddess Minerva & Athena according to William Henry), the caduceus (the symbol for the House of representatives, and medical profession), Allseeing eye within a pyramid, Apron, and ziggurat to name a few originated in ancient Khemet (Egypt)

  William Henry's segment on Thomas Jefferson was pretty deep I did not know he did a study on Egyptian hieroglphs and Michamac ""Indian"" cryptographic scripts and saw them as almost identical. Jefferson was called the father of American cryptography. And his wheel cypher was used by spys during many modern wars. There are many more revelations on Jefferson on this DVD. Henry's discourse on Nimrod (founder of Freemasonry?,first Grand Master) extremely interesting. According to a widespread rumor, within the so called higher degrees of Freemasonry therein resides an inner circle, the enlightened, if there is an inner circle in Freemasonry this DVD could prepare you for this level. This DVD is very simliar to the DVD ""Mother of Christian Church the Egyptian Temple"" by an understudy of Dr. Ben this DVD (Egyptian Temple) provides a better balance and objectivity. Overall ""National Treasures"" is a surprisingly well put  together piece of work.",1154217600,31,1404,5.426605504587156

8073570,5,B000A34580,"This film was not made to entertain. It was made to educate and educate it does. Loaded with great images, I have long admired the research of Investigative Mythologist William Henery. There is way more information and a great history of Illuminati symbols and imagery then you will ever find in any other presentation. If you really want to get the best evidence about the illuminate as depicted in the movie of the same name, this is the place to get it. And it's loaded with way more information than some fluffy History channel TV show. Be prepared and for-warned!",1487980800,,568,4.69

8073575,1,B000A34580,"This is the kind of thing that only spreads ignorance.  William Henry is a self-styled ""investigative mythologist"", a title, like that of ""symbologist"", unknown to academe.  I am myself an iconographer, a degreed art historian specializing in the meanings of symbols in art and architecture.  To me, this presentation is nothing more than an insult to any viewer's intelligence.

Mr. Henry, peace be to him, has no qualifications whatsoever to be explaining anything.  Moreover, he evidently hasn't a clue about the existence of actual degree programs that, drawing on centuries of actual scholarship, qualify a person to discuss these symbols.  Worst of all, he has not grasped the obvious fact that these are not secret symbols.  People don't put secret symbols on the most public monuments and the most common articles--coins, for example--particularly when these things derive much of their value from the easy communication afforded by their symbols.  In the memorable phrase of the great scholar Ernst Kantorowicz, ""It was supposed to be self-explanatory.""

Any basically educated person--even today--knows perfectly well what a personification is, what a Phyrgian cap or pileus is, what an eagle symbolizes, what any of our state and federal symbols mean.  Mr. Henry does not. After watching this poor presentation, his viewers won't, either.

Get yourself to an actual school.  Or, for crying out loud, just do a little research!  These public symbols are your common heritage; it is not possible to fully understand the society in which you live unless you have enough common knowledge--and common sense--to understand these universal symbols.  And the very essence of a public symbol is that it is self-evident.  These things are not secret, they're certainly not sinister, and they are absolutely not intended to be guessed at.  And they're not what Mr. Henry says they are.",1308528000,,1885,5.275167785234899
8073576,4,B000A34580,"National Treasures presents a wealth of fascinating things you probably didn't know about the founding of the U.S.  To think that Sir Francis Bacon's secret treasure could be buried under the Capitol Building, and more!  While the production of this documentary is not quite up to Stephen Spielberg standards, the information presented seems to be fairly well investigated and sourced.  That which is speculative is identified as such, presented as a possibility only.  Most people have no idea of the ideals and practices that the Founding Fathers, many of whom were Freemasons, believed in.  And that the United States represented the new Atlantis to them.  As recommended at the end of the documentary, it made me want to find out more about this.",1248480000,4,750,5.056910569105691

When watched the video, though, we both ended up laughing at its cheesy direction and its far-reaching theories.  We turned it off mid-way through and donated it.",1231286400,3,264,4.717391304347826
