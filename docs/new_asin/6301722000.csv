I imagine her more in a role as a cowgirl w a whip or as her role as mannish madame in the movie walk on the wild side.  Loni is perfect in role. It shows psychology issues (loni's anxiety issues) and relationship disagreement/conflict. Today's movies do not compare since so many have fake, harmonious or cookie cutter family characters. The reason loni is bedridden is due to anxiety. This is one of the few films that portray anxious people. She does an excellent job playing a sensitive, nervous,  empathetic and feminine woman. Alot of modern movies show strongminded insensitive women. The movie is intriguing and was a tear jerker 4 me. The movie is full of emotion.",1440806400,,816,4.575342465753424

I thought the acting was wonderful and there just isn't hardly anyone more beautiful than Loni Anderson. When I bought the movie, I didn't try to compare it to the original. Loni gave a more sensitive sad portrayal of the doomed character than Barbara Stanwyck. When you have a remake made over 40 years later, you really should not compare it to the original. Hal Holbrooks gave an excellent portrayal as Loni's father as well. I totally disagree with the other reviews on this board. This movie is worth having in your collection.",1174953600,2,607,4.682242990654205
