2431292,5,B000BNX4MW,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer, albeit with fewer exclamation marks.  This was a fabulous movie.  Must be what they mean by character-driven fiction.  All the actors were amazing and there was such palpable chemistry between the Ian McKellan and the two leads.  It was amazing.  It ended just the way it had to.  I definitely intend to purchase it and recommend you do the same.",1130198400,13,390,4.661764705882353
2431293,5,B000BNX4MW,"I SAW ""ASYLUM""!!!!!!!!

The movie is breathtaking. Marton Csokas performance is oscarworthy. You cry half the movie.

The story is absolutly amazing. It's sooooo suspenseful. Natasha Richardson and Ian McKellen were great, too. But Marton was the star. He was AMAZING and HOT.

Watch the movie and you will go crazy about Marton and become a great, big fan.

I hope he gets more attention now. He is a fantastic actor.

WATCH THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!",1130025600,5,447,4.986486486486487
2431294,4,B000BNX4MW,"A very well protrayed pseudo psychoanalysis of the dynamics of obsessive love. Asylum explores the pathos of obsession by way of a female character (Stella) that falls in love with a patient in the mental institution where her husband is positioned to become the next superintendent. The film does an excellent job of exploring the ""at all cost"" behavior of the obsessed. From a lifeless marriage to a life-threatening affair, Stella ends up without love, passion or security. The destruction of her life slowly unfolds, leaving the viewer guessing what will happen next and exactly how far she will take an affair that most sane people would have realized as dangerous, partially fulfilling, at best, and extremely short-term.",1124755200,12,727,5.169491525423729

2431313,2,B000BNX4MW,"Wow! What a broad range of reviews here. This movie is NOT a 5-star (think Schindler's List, Silence of the Lambs}, nor
is it unwatchable.
The storyline has been rehashed already - and be careful what reviews you read because many contain spoilers.
The pace of this movie IS slow. There are a lot of holes missing - I didn't know it was based on a book until reading another review saying there was a lot missing from the storyline. It shows. A lot of things don't make common sense - why does this woman have sex with a man she's barely spoken to? Pack up her bags and leave her son to live with a man who murdered his wife?
I did finish it- I didn't find the ending to be a twist as some stated. It was abrupt though. The acting was superb, the storyline was obviously way over-edited as you continuously ask yourself ""WHY would she do this?"" Not nearly enough character build-up.
Worth a viewing, but not a movie I'll remember a few days from now.
**Side note - why do people reviews movies when they state ""I only watched 10 minutes"". That's ridiculous and adds no value to others reading reviews.",1452902400,2,1101,4.349514563106796

However, I was not impressed with the movie, and found it predictable as it moved from her loveless marriage to the arms of a mentally unstable handyman, who was a sculptor who beat his wife to death with a hammer. I couldn't understand her attraction to him. In one tragic scene, she goes from a dangerous relationship, to a terrible tragedy that sends her over the edge.

2431342,4,B000BNX4MW,"I think I liked it. It seems like the director maybe wants to use foreshadowing with respect to Ian McKellen's character being the most pathologically obsessed headcase of the lot, but his character isn't really developed. I haven't read the book, but it really feels like a film that uses literary devices only people who've studied luterature to some small degree would look for. Like:
1. Mckellen's name is Dr. Peter Cleave - Peter (phallus~ sexual focuse) Cleave (an unweildy yet purposeful instrument used to separate/chop quickly through meat, even to the bone).
2. Richardson's character is Stella Raphael - Stella (maybe coarse and raw, like the character in ""streetcar Named Desire,"" of the same uncommon name.) Raphael - an the name of an archangel, but also one that evokes Renaissance art and impossibul beauty by the artist of the same name).
3. When they meet, Dr. Cleave says his focus at the asylum is ""extreme cases, of particular interest: on sexual pathology and resulting disasters...I spend my life immersed in the passions of others. Dangerous Sport, love.""
4. The male love interest is a sculptor (artists work in the creative, so not only is his mind not suceptible to a practical methodology, he's clever, manipulative and impulsive) who is criminally insane and committed because he killed his wife in a brutal and violent way, also mutilating her face. And he suffers from ""morbid obsession.""

That's the focus of the movie - how Dr. Cleave (who doesn't dispute he is homosexual throghout the film) seeks to understand and contol male-female love, take it from realm of beauty and make it a ""sport"" by intentionally positioning two physically attractive people (both in obvious states of controlled sexual frustration) in a setting where yhey will unavoidably meet and liaise. Knowing also that he's pissed he got passed over for promotion by an outsider who, in 1960 ""proper"" society is married (thus ""stable and suitable,"" unlike a ""confirmed batchelor"" would be regarded), and less experienced. Cleave, fuled by his morbid obsession with his own advancement and superior abilities as a doctor, seeks to act as puppet-master by creating the settings perfect for an unavoidably destructive relationship. Later, when passed over (again) he siezes upon circumstances to put his two puppets in place, going so far as manipulating Raphael to let him get closer to her through marriage. Disaster ensues, leading to Raphael's final words (and the last of the film): ""Leave. Me. Alone.""  (I.e., I know you were only playing me like a puppet and messing with my head). His shock and horror at how monstrous he's been is revealed brilliantly just by facial expressions McKellen masterfully delivers.

BUT instead of adding meat to these aspects to make it a true ""psychological thriller,"" the director focuses on the sex and obsession - which is why people keep saying it's a gothic romance. There's no love anywhere in this film. It's chaotic to watch, and really doesn't seem to have a point until the last 3 minutes.

So yeah - it was a book disgused as a movie, inviting literary analysis. Should have been a movie about Dr. Cleave, and whatever it was that messed up his head so badly he got a psyche degree just to see what he could get people to do.",1438732800,2,3275,4.938294010889292

2431353,2,B000BNX4MW,"I finished 'Asylum' the book by Patrick McGrath which this movie is based on yesterday and I gave the book 2 stars. I don't feel the subject of infidelity a pleasant read. When I first got a hold of the book I was excited...Goodreads described it as a Gothic, Horror, Mystery. Normally I find movie adaptations of books I read tolerable...all the way to this was awesome. For a book that I didn't really like, I felt this movie was even worse. The whole movie is rushed. As a viewer with no knowledge of the book and the backstory to these characters you can not decipher what is going on.

I hated Stella's character I felt she was a horrible mother. I couldn't fathom taking such risks with a child at home. Yes by all means be a tramp on your own time, but not when there is a small one depending on you. This movie paints Stella to be a star crossed lover. In the book though she not only lets her sexual hunger out to Edgar, but to several men. Which made me hate her even more.

The ending is changed in the movie, not sure if that makes it more dramatic...it definitely makes Peter out to be more sinister. I did find his character strange and thought he helped to drive Stella into this whole scenario, but  I didn't think his character was as bad as the movie made him out to be.

If you hated this movie but want to know what actually went on I'd read the book. Even though I didn't like the subject matter of the book it was a fast read. I think the director did a very poor job of translating this movie from the book.",1434844800,,1530,4.176271186440678

My heart was knocked when ""sick"" Stella asked Dr. Peter Cleave this question as a response to his kind marriage offer. If she has been looking for ""good"", she already had it before ""sick"". But she just ""cannot live like this"" as former husband hollered at her.

Many sex scenes.

Sex is a deep desire of human beings. But it reflects our passion. Nobody can fake passion I guess.

Stella is ""sick"" because she has too much passion for sex but too less passion for many other live things. I am not saying she is simply sex addictive, but her life and her surroundings bent and compressed her living passion. It is a tragic pity.",1425081600,,656,4.45

In the story, Richardson's character, Stella, is married to a somewhat cold and controlling man who comes to take over the asylum (no, not like in Spellbound) and she is clearly unfulfilled as a woman in almost every way.
Ian McKellen plays the resident shrink who wanted the job for himself, but stays on as the steady, reliable ""fixture"" as he puts it.
Enter Csokas' character, Edgar, who is a patient at the asylum who is rehabilitated sufficiently to work in the garden of the new administrator fixing a glass house (any double entendre?) and eventually catches the eye of his wife, Stella.

I don't wish to go into the many twists and turns that the plot takes us through, because I'm hoping you'll watch this. But suffice to say that all is not what it may seem. There are many unanswered questions at the end and I like that!

This leads to the torrid and lustful scenes between Richardson's bored and unhappily married character and the good looking asylum resident who just happened to have hacked up his former wife.

2431528,2,B000BNX4MW,"There have been many films titled 'Asylum' over the years.  At least one I can think of was pretty good. The 1972 film with Peter Cushing. Last night we watched one with that name from 2005 starring Natasha Richardson and Ian McKellen. It was listed as a 'Horror' film at Amazon Prime Videos and had a high rating.  I would consider it more a steamy psychological drama than horror.  As might be expected by the names involved it was well acted.  The settings and visuals were well done too.  The first one third of the film was promising.  It's the story of a psychiatrist named Max that comes to work in a new position at large asylum for the mentally disturbed including the criminally insane.  He brings along his seemingly bored wife Stella (played by the late Natasha Richardson) and young son. Ian McKellen plays Dr. Cleave, a long time doctor there that felt he deserved the position that Max was given. The wife (Natasha Richardson) soon falls for one of the inmates, Edgar.  Edgar is a man who was found guilty in the murder and disfigurement of his former wife. Yes, what woman could resist such a tempting bad boy like Edgar, geesh.  Soon Stella and Edgar begin an unlikely steamy love affair right under the nose of her husband, the guards and everyone else at the Asylum.  This place has some security. They have steamy love making encounters right on the asylum grounds in places where he is doing jobs as a trusted inmate.  Sometimes they just miss being caught on the grounds by a guard coming to check on him.  It all becomes rather laughable the chances the wife takes.  Still the first third of the film is intriguing and makes you wonder where it will all lead. Is Ian McKellen's character some how a part of all this? What part does he play in what's to come? Unfortunately the story soon turns into one where you do not care about a single character in the film with the exception of the little boy.  The inmate soon easily escapes when he realizes he will not be released anytime in the near future.  The wife finds shopping excursion excuses to go weekly into the city where she joins him at his hide out.  Eventually Stella leaves her husband to be with Edgar, even though he is now jealous of her talking to other men and beats her regularly.  The story goes even further downhill from there dragging on with more depressing and irritating developments.  Finally at the depressing end we found ourselves asking ourselves why they turned such a promising drama into such a total mess.  Don't bother watching this film unless you like depressing pointless movies with characters you eventually don't care about. I give this a 2 out of 5 rating for the acting.",1370736000,,2684,4.577405857740586
2431529,2,B000BNX4MW,"About the only pleasure to be found in this unrelentingly unpleasant and thoroughly unconvincing film is seeing Hugh Bonneville (Lord Grantham in ""Downton Abbey"") as a somewhat younger man.  Unfortunately, he plays a career-obssessed prig unable to understand or satisfy his wife (Natasha Richardson), so there's not a lot for him to do other than evidence stick-up-your-bum British reserve.  When the film starts, with Bonneville taking a new, live-in position at an asylum for the criminally insane, thing are already icy between him and Richardson, so it's difficult to know how their relationship went south or why, other than the fact that they have a typically charming English schoolboy son, they have stayed together.  Richardson leaps so quickly into a passionate affair with a homicidal inmate that it's difficult not to see her as in serious need of psychiatric intervention herself (yes, he's good looking and yes, he apparently became visibly aroused when they danced together at an institute function, but Richardson's character would have seemed more believable, not to mention sympathetic, had it taken her awhile to be drawn into the relationship). After a number of highly erotic interactions in a greenhouse (in what seems to be full view of other inmates working nearby ... apparently Richardson and the inmate like risky sex), the film devolves predictably ... they get caught, he escapes, she goes to him ... and then reaches its aesthetic and emotional nadir in a brutal scene in which the inmate brutally beats Richardson, including a direct punch in the face that is one of the most startling depictions of violence against a woman I've ever seen on screen.

2431547,4,B000BNX4MW,"Erotic, dark, Hitchcockian, and inevitably downbeat are all terms that can be used to describe Asylum. The late great Natasha Richardson gives a subtly powerful and occassionally wrenching performance in one of her last film appearances.

Richardson, who also served as executive producer, plays Stella Raphael, a desperately unhappy British housewife circa 1960. Bored with her stodgy and condescending psychiatrist husband (Hugh Bonneville), Stella embarks on an intensely erotic but ultimately destructive romance with Edgar (Marton Csokas), a patient at the asylum where her husband serves as a deputy director.

Unfortunately, Edgar is pathologically jealous, having been committed to the asylum for brutally murdering his wife. Soon Stella is living in fear of her lover.

This movie, despite its lack of overt feminism, still gives us a glimpse at how women's submission to male dominance can cause them heartache. Asylum also serves as a warts-and-all portrait of a woman who, due to the constrictions placed on traditional middle-class women, resorts to lies, manipulation, underhanded rebellion, and cold-blooded selfishness to escape the tedium of her life to absolutely disastrous results. Although the film is about twenty minutes too long (at least in my opinion), I found it entertaining and thought-provoking.

The film centers on a cold husband, his bored wife, the recovering mental patient to whom the wife forms an attachment, and the hospital administrator who manipulates the weaknesses of all those characters to his own ends.  What's interesting is that, even though individual scenes take their time, emphasizing performance and introspection, the movie as a whole moves rather quickly.  Every scene either advances the plot or shows something steamy.  It makes me wonder if a longer cut of the film exists somewhere, a version where the film as a whole is as methodical and deliberately paced as its individual scenes.  Maybe not.  Maybe this 99-minute drama is just as long as it needs to be to showcase the foibles and bad decisions and jealousies that too often bring sadness and tragedy to human relationships.

The DVD features a lush visual image, sharp yet handsomely burnished in autumnal shades, and clear yet nuanced sound.  There are no extra features to speak of, except for a few previews.",1218412800,3,1088,5.073033707865169
2431549,5,B000BNX4MW,"I don't write long reviews so if you want a rehash of the plot please go to the regular publicity.

This is an outstanding film. It reminds me a lot of Pinter's classic The Servant, which was also about decaying relationships. Also set in 1960s Britain - it has more of a 50s feel - it explores the devastating effect of the relationship between a psychiatric doctor's wife and a mental patient. Whereas the Pinter film only really had 3 characters however, this has 6, all wonderfully drawn and beautifully acted. It is an actor's movie, if ever there was one. Most fascinating and yes, creepy is the Ian McKellen role, as the ambitious mental hospital director who himself has a secret obsession with the doctor's wife ( Natasha Richardson). If you never understood the term ""control freak"" before, just watch this guy. It knocks anything in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" into a cocked hat.
  In a market awash with third rate comedy this drama has all the hallmarks of classic tragedy with no-one emerging from a terrible chain of events unscathed. In spite of this one never loses sympathy for any of the characters and indeed feels great pity for most, even McKellen. Nothing in this film is flashy. It is mostly very understated and constantly begs the question, what really does motivate human behavior? The worst that you could say of it is that it is stylish.

Stella is a beautiful woman, living in depressing and a boring marriage to her psychiatist husband.  She is isolated and lonely and her only preoccupation in life is her young son.  But there is a desire for Stella to feel happy, elated, excited and wanted.  She finds it with a mental patient at the hospital where her husband works.  The sexual tension between the two is instanteous.  The fact that the young man is an artist (sculptor) invokes notions of deep romantic emotional attachment she hopes to attain.  Their secret love making in the glass garden house, makes their affair irresistible to her.  But the young patient is morbidly jealous that makes him unable to control himself and function normally in any relationship.  The hights and lows of their relationship are destructive to them and all around them.  As we watch this story unfold with all of its unfortunate turns of events, one almost feels sorry for the woman that men see as a possesion to be paraded around, or stored away safely, when all she really needs is attention,love and passion.

2431553,2,B000BNX4MW,"A thriller that offers obvious leads to obvious ends with occasional punches direcltly to a woman's face.

The themes of the film (passion, obsession, jealousy, insanity vs sanity) would have been much better served if at least SOME of the situations or characters in this film were a BIT more sympathetic. (WARNING - there are spoilers ahead!)

Csokas' character Cleave is so one dimensional, so uninteresting, and so wooden you wonder what richarson's Stella ever sees in him.  OK - there is an underlying Russell Crowe/Brendon Frazier primal urgency that may have interested her at first.  But the man is a bore.  Worse, he's an obvious true lunatic who is said to have murdered his wife, decapitated her, scalped her, then hacked at her face like the clay he feebly molds as a failed artist.  Even if Stella had volcanic orgasms with this guy, wouldn't she have been a bit more apprehensive about continuing, and renewing, this relationship over and over and over again?

Ian McKellen remains a joy to watch.  His well contained performance is all in his eyes. A performance that begs us to question the line between neurosis and true insanity.

Ultimately the film is unsatisfying. Stella is so wretched - ultimately spacing out while watching her son drown leading to his death - viewers can only feel relief when she falls to her ultimate Hitchcockian vertiginous doom. Even here, we're reminded of what the master director knew; there is more to fear in what is unseen, rather than what is actually seen.

Though we get to watch Edgar pummel her, at least we're spared the indignity of watching him hack her to pieces.

2431554,3,B000BNX4MW,"This movie is billed as a psychological thriller. Not so!

A psychological drama.... Yes.

It is amazing how movie companies try to attach names of other famous people (like Hitchcock in this case) to help a movie sell instead of letting it run on it's own merit.

This movie is intriguing to say the least. The time it takes place, the 50's, was still full of repression. And so the husband of Natassja Richardson's character. Hence her restlessness and attraction to her Waterloo.

I won't go into a lot of detail but to say the performances by Richardson and McKellan are superb! The plot is rich with character and twists and turns.

However.... it is NOT a thriller by any sense of the word.

So... if you're seeking a movie with the thrills that a good Hitchcock or DePalma movie may hold, do not get this one.

However, if what you want is a good psychological drama along the lines of 'Snows Falling on Cedars' or 'Far From The Madding Crowd', then this is your movie.

2431556,4,B000BNX4MW,"Asylum brings obsession, sex, and passion into perspective and in and out of marriage in this film with beautiful Natasha Richardson, Ian McKellen, and a cast of veteran British character actors whose fine performances bring depth and pathos to a story of insanity and love. Who are the patients and who are the caregivers is questionable in the setting of a rural hospital for the criminally insane. There, an ambitious new head, Dr. Raphael (Hugh Bonneville) arrives with his stunning but distant, bored wife, Stella (Natasha Richardson), and their young son, Charley. They are surrounded by patients whose regulated existence is mirrored in the conservative views and practices of the medical staff and their middle class wives. She is warned by her husband to fit in, a threat more than a request.

Richardson's character, Stella Raphael meets Dr. Cleve (McKellen), a bachelor administrator who has been passed over for the job her husband holds after years of loyal service. His resentment and contrivances are the gist of this storyline but recognized only in hindsight. Cleve tells Stella at their first meeting that his specialty are sexual cases in which passions not his can be observed (and manipulated). His pet patient is a handsome artist who in a fit of jealousy murdered his wife. Cleve allows the artist to be a laborer in the backyard conservatory of Stella's home where she is easily drawn to him and seduced.

Their passionate trysts take over their daily routine and the hospital gossip begins. Stella's husband is too submerged in work and fitting in with the surroundings to notice his wife's obsession. The obsessive sexual attachment of Stella and the artist result in his eventual escape from the hospital with her following him and the expected disastrous results that verge on the Greek tragedy scale. In the second half of the film, unexpected twists and turns brings all the men of Stella's life in direct conflict and collision.

The mature storyline is filled with vibrant scenery and grittiness in sets reflecting beautiful cinematography. Each actor is subtle and never over the top that brings the unexpected to a satisfying ending without drawing overt conclusions for the audience. It is another small and quiet British film which they excel in producing. For my money, it was more than worth the viewing.",1146873600,,2342,5.062176165803109
2431557,2,B000BNX4MW,"With a good script and a director better suited to the material (I've read Pedro Almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and Jonathan Demme was originally attached to direct), Asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star Natasha Richardson.  Unfortunately, the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession.

The basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist's wife (an excellent Natasha Richardson) and one of the asylum's patients (an equally good Marton Csokas), under the watchful eye of the patient's doctor (Ian McKellen).  There are several plot twists in the last part of the movie, some of which seem quite preposterous, at least in the way the movie was shot.

The only reason to watch this movie is to see Natasha Richardson.  She does her best in spite of the choppy script, and she even won a Best Actress award in London for this film.  However, as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession, director David Mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job.  (In fact, I remember that in the promotional interviews Richardson, credited as an executive producer, sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out.)",1145491200,7,1480,5.040983606557377
2431558,4,B000BNX4MW,"In the 1960s Max Raphael (Hugh Bonneville) becomes a director at an English asylum that dates from the Victorian era and that peculiar combination of lavish grounds and dungeons that reflected the evolving sensibilities towards the mentally ill.  He is accompanied by his wife, Stella (Natasha Richardson), and their young son, Charlie (Gus Lewis), with the family living on the grounds.  The family is greeted by Peter Cleave (Ian McKellen), who has been at this place for a long time, quite possibly since the days of good old Queen Victoria, and he expected to be given the administrative position.  Now he is relegated to being Max's chief assistant, and when Max makes a point of remind Peter, ""I am your superior,"" Peter responds by asking ""In what sense?""  The remark is uttered with a charming smile, but there is such an underlying threat behind it that you immediately think of the spider and the fly.

One of Peter's patients is Edgar Stark (Marton Csokas), who is assigned the task of rebuilding a gardener's shed that Stella wants to use.  When Charlie, desperate for attention and some form of friendship, develops a relationship with Edgar, which has Stella concerned.  When something happens to Charlie, she assumes Edgar is responsible, and when that turns out not to be the case, her feelings for Edgar turn into something else.  The next thing we know, every opportunity she can find, Stella is stealing away to the shed for bouts of intense sex with Edgar.  Stella never articulates her reasoning for this affair and we are left to piece together our own thoughts by looking at her relationships with her husband and son, the life she is forced to live at the asylum, and the mysterious stranger who wants her.  Even when she finds out why he is in the asylum, it does not matter because her obsession is complete.

""Asylum"" is not a love story, but rather a descent into Hell, and we can take comfort in knowing that Stella is beyond the pale so that we do not have to bring the grace of God into the equation.  At some point it will be clear to you that Stella's character has no desire for redemption and you may well decide she does not deserve it anyway.  Plus there is the question of how much Cleave is responsible for what happens.  From the start of this 2005 film I was nervous about what McKellan's character was up to, and while I think he would claim more credit for events than is his due, I do not for a second believe his hands are clean.  But this is really clearly Richardson's film, and I swear that she says virtually nothing in scene after scene.  Every pivotal moment for her character is a look rather than a line of dialogue, because what she does from start to finish is more revealing than anything she ever says, and while we are riveted by the performance.",1145145600,12,2804,4.600401606425703
2431559,4,B000BNX4MW,"A few years ago, famous horror director David Cronenberg (A History of Violence) directed the film adaptation of the Patrick McGrath novel ""Spider"".

Spider was a fantastic film, psychologically chilling and it was also a thriller that made you think. It was easily one of the best films of that year; I became a Patrick McGrath fan shortly thereafter. I only read ""Spider"" though and had two other novels that I had never read ""Dr. Haggards Disease"" and ""Asylum"". One day, while looking through Hollywood Video I saw this movie and knew it was the film adaptation of the novel right away. Now, I still have never read the book so this review is based solely on the film. It really doesn't hold up to ""Spider"". The performances are top notch and I love the cinematography (especially during the suicide scene) and it's not a bad movie...It's just that it lacks the mystery, suspense, and spooky atmosphere that ""Spider"" had. Maybe if I wasn't comparing this to that I would've liked this movie quite a bit more...But frankly, this movie is a C movie and is only getting a B from me due to the powerful ending. The movie is about Stella (Natasha Richardson) who's husband Max Raphael is the newly appointed Deputy Superintendent of a maxium security asylum. Not very far from the asylum lives Stella and her family (including her son Charlie) and one of the patients Edgar Stark (Marton Csokas) begins working on their run down greenhouse. Stella and Edgar are attracted to each other, oddly enough and begin an affair, but to top that off...Edgar is in the asylum for the murder of his wife. Ian McKellen (The Lord of the Rings, X-Men) is great in his role as Peter Cleave, Edgar's doctor who spends the movie keeping Stella and Edgar apart. Now, this movie isn't spectacular by any means. It's not one of the best films of the year, but it does tell an interesting story. Rent it before you buy it and rent ""Spider"" first.

2431560,5,B000BNX4MW,this is another wonderful movie featuring the NZ actor marton Csokas. It is a suspense thrill ride with a wonderful look at the limits between passion and obsession.  A great movie for anyone who needs something a little different.,1141862400,2,231,4.923076923076923
2431561,4,B000BNX4MW,"Two people are caught in a British insane asylum, a woman who's married to one of its doctors, and a patient who brutally murdered his wife.  The two, once finding each other, are instantly attracted to each other and begin to obsess over each other, before it culminates in his escape and her following.  But their attempted escape from the asylum is largely insuccessful as the strict order of the loveless world around them always tries to tie them down and their degressive control over their own emotions severs the bonds between them.

So basically we have a story about love that turns into obsession that turns, literally, into insanity, a theme I am quite intrigued with and that was explored certainly to surprising degrees here.  The movie wastes no time in foreshadowing all the events that will happen, along with making quite clear in the first few moments of screentime that yes, in fact, Stella is a de facto inmate of the asylum.  So while it wouldn't necessarily be subtle--in fact seeming to race ahead at moments when one expects the exposition to be more gradual--it still contains a vested interest in showing just how hard it can be sometimes to separate desire from insanity.

And maybe, to a degree, it's so blatantly three-act, and follows a sense of rigid literature that it is somewhat cliched in its structure, but for that it can still be enjoyed as a theatre, to sit back and focus more on the acting and just how the story progresses, not where it's going to progress which should be quite obvious to any viewer from the beginning.

2431562,4,B000BNX4MW,"Patrick McGrath's novel 'Asylum' was more a poetic elegy about thwarted love and lust than the screenplay by Patrick Marber ('Closer') addresses.  The improbability of the story, when McGrath's poetic prose is extracted, surfaces and the nuances of a dark love story are lessened.  Despite this the film is a worthy, strange story with a fine cast lending lustre to it.

The time is the 1950s, and the place is a mental institution in the outskirts of London where Max Raphael (Hugh Bonneville) brings his wife Stella (Natasha Richardson) and young son Charlie (Gus Lewis) to begin his tenure as a psychologist.  The asylum is dark, dank, and foreboding, a place where the wives of the doctors are expected to behave and be bored at silly conclaves and teas, all lead by the director Jack (Joss Ackland) and his stuffy wife Bridie (Wanda Ventham).  The sinister Dr. Peter Cleave (Ian McKellen) observes the new couple with suspicion, as they are his 'competition' in the ascendancy of director.  Peter is coldly genial and concerns himself only with his 'pet patient' Edgar (Marton Csokas), a handsome but dark sculptor who is institutionalized for brutally murdering and dismembering his wife and for whom Peter appears to have a sexual attraction.

In no time Stella is bored, not even able to assist her maid Mrs. Rose (Sara Thurston) in household chores. Stella sees Edgar and an attraction is mutually palpable, and soon enough they begin acting out their frustrated prolonged lust in the greenhouse Edgar is renovating.  Peter and the other staff expect the affair, but when circumstances surface Max's ready embarrassment at his wife's behavior explodes.  Edgar escapes the asylum to live with his old friend Nick (Sean Harris) and before long Stella discovers his whereabouts in London and begins assignations there under the guise of shopping trips. Ultimately she responds to Edgar's demands to leave her family and live with him, all the while watching Edgar plunge into the same mental state that preceded the murder of his wife.  Peter relentlessly seeks out the couple, finds them and returns Stella to her husband who has been fired from his job because of her dalliances.  They move to North Wales to a meager life, Edgar follows, and before long the couple reunites with disastrous results.  Stella's mind is broken and she tacitly sits and watches her son drown, and as a result she is returned to the asylum as a patient.  The ending is bleak and somewhat unexpected and ties the story of love abnormally focused to a circular closure.

Filmed in atmospheric dark tones by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens the story's mood remains grim.  The cast is excellent with most of the honors going to Ian McKellen in one of his usual highly nuanced performances.  Natasha Richardson is believable as the tortured Stella and Hugh Bonneville is aptly cold and distant.  Marton Csokas finds the dark interior of Edgar and is understandably the source of attraction for both Stella and Peter. The director David Mackenzie ('Young Adam') needed to pay more attention to the editing, a problem that makes this tale of downfall choppy and disjointed.  Otherwise 'Asylum' is a suspenseful, tragic story of the asylums people create for themselves. But oh, for the poetry of Patrick McGrath... Recommended.

2431563,3,B000BNX4MW,"Natasha Richardson (The White Countess, Maid In Manhattan) plays Stella Raphael, her husband Max, played by Hugh Bonneville and her son Charlie, played by Gus Lewis (Batman Begins) who move into a secured psychiatric hospital (Asylum). Soon after getting settled in Stella's son Charlie takes up a friendship with a man named Edgar, played by Marton Csokas (Aeon Flux, xXx, Timeline) who is a convicted killer who brutally killed his wife. Stella then starts to sleep around with Edgar and which case soon Edgar escapes. She then goes behind her husband's back and finds out where he is, leaving her husband and son for this man in which case she misses her child and she is soon found and brought back but she still has feelings for Edgar. Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, upcoming The Da Vinci Code) stars as Peter Cleave who is one of the head doctors in the Asylum and who takes up an interest in Stella's love for convict Edgar. Directed by David Mackenzie (Young Adam) and also starring Joss Ackland (Lethal Weapon 2, No Good Deed)and Sean Harris. Richardson is outstanding and Csokas gives off a shrill chill but he is really  really good..no wonder which helps with the films impact and story. McKellan does his usual brava work here. It does have it's ups and downs but still an interesting story. Not for every taste but still worth a look. Is it me or was this kinda like Young Adam in a Asylum? Hmm, maybe it was me",1137456000,,1435,4.60546875
2431564,1,B000BNX4MW,"Well, the summer movie season is definately on, which means there are lots of lackluster blockbusters and--for those of us that prefer something a bit more intellectual--independant films.  ""Asylum""--which stars Natasha Richardson as a woman who leaves her phycho-therapist husband for a mental patient and then goes insane herself and Ian McKellen as her lover's doctor--has all the pretentiousness of an intellectual, entertaining independant film but fails to live up to expectations.

""Asylum,"" or as I call it ""This Summer's Swimming Pool,"" has all the elements that a good film should have.  It has a story about adultery, violence, and insanity, three elements which left alone could create a compelling story and thrown together should be absolutely riviting.  The film also features a stellar cast and a noteworthy screenwriter, Patrick Marber, famed for writing the stage and screen versions of ""Closer,"" another film I felt particularly raped out of ten dollars by.  In all fairness, I saw ""Asylum"" at a free sneek-preview show and also had a complimentary glass of wine beforehand, so the experience wasn't a total waste of time or money.

The main problems in ""Asylum"" come from poor writing and directing.  Some of the lines in the film were so poorly written and cheesy that the entire audience was laughing hysterically at certain points; definately not the desired reaction to a dramatic piece.  Other scenes seemed barely stitched together or crafted.  For example, after building the tension between the woman and the inmate she eventually falls for, the director totally lost all energy and chemestry between them during their first sex scene.  The lovemaking between the characters lasted a dismal minute and a half, making me and half the audience laugh.  A ninety-year-old man could last longer than that, and if the writer or director doubt that they could have asked Ian McKellen as he was on set.

In short, if you're in the mood for a good independant film, I hear ""My Date With Drew"" and ""March of the Penguins"" are quite good.  But stay away from ""Asylum"" as the creators of it should have been put in one.",1133308800,9,2135,5.014164305949008
8089962,5,B000BNX4MW,"ok the sexiest sexy scene I have ever experienced.  Be warned,  after the great sex in the Green House, nothing really good ever happens to them again. the meaning of the title,  I think,  is both the asylum given - and lost -  by love,  as well as the obvious physical location of the story.
The disturbing and fatally sad character,  defly portrayed by the late Natasha Richardson,  is unforgettable to me.  And with the odd and beautiful  physicality of Marton Csokas, whose body seems both unpleasantly unused and so not quite fitting him well until he actually starts to break and then his body seems to fit him,  it is a good film to watch a few times,  if you cant take the depressing manner in which they must carry out thier awful lives.  As a severley dangerous mentally ill man who is both innocent and wildly seductive, Csokas  watches the wife of the new ambitious  psychiatrist at a dower and discouraging mental hospital in the dour and discouraging Great Britain of the 1950's.  the patient is loved  and coveted by his gay doctor,  a sadistic and manipulative queen,  perfectly at home in the decaying environment of the hospital.  His horrific conspiracy to overtake
and control the life of his patient by overtaking and controlling the woman he loves is disturbing.  the end of the movie
is a bit of a let down,  but just a bit.
finally,  Csokas portrayal of a dangerous psyhotic man is spot on. his loss of small abilities to control his thinking,  as the normal day to day
falls away and clearly little food is being eaten,  little regard for safety or grooming,  is really tells the tale of the disinegration of what little
normalcy they had -albeit wild ones-  when they first started their wild and illicit affair.
Natasha,  too,  shows us a woman out of control of any aspect of her life,  no matter who she is with.  total emotional suppression or extreme extroverted sexual display,  she is a woman in pain and in danger.  The actress is beautiful,  physically,  in this role,  the perfect face,  both surprized at herself and horrified and hungry all at once.
the meloncoly musical theme, with an oboe, a repeated phrase that is not particularly lusty,  adds to the odd normalcy of obsession.",1517097600,,2220,4.640826873385013

However, Ian McKellen does a fantastic job playing a bored wicked psychologist who has taken to the unforgivable manipulation of human beings in retribution for a lesser man (his opinion) being given the head position he should have had.  Of course can you imagine the horrific games he would play with all the patients if he were in charge, which of course in the end after he destroys three people, he is placed in charge.
