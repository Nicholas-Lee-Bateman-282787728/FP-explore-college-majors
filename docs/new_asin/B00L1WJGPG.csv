6462178,4,B00L1WJGPG,"I just ordered it. I have been waiting so many years for it I did not bother with waiting for an economy price because some art you are never sure will truly return. Try looking for a season of Rorouni Kenshin or the complete Tex Avery shorts collection if you don't believe me that popularity cannot prevent time and negligence from sending a good cartoon into a nether realm of unpurchasable purgatory. Grab it while you can and maybe  some more companies will release more lost titles.

I hold up a glass of wine right now and hope (thanks to people purchasing rare gems like these) someone releases the Calamity Jane animated series, Captain Simian and the Space Monkeys, Ferherlofia Son of the White Mare, Allegro Non Troppo, The Complete Tex Avery, Paranoia Agent, Gundam Wing, Gundam 0083, Megas XLR, Symbiotic Titan, Invasion America, the Savage Dragon, the Gen 13 animated movie, and Twice Upon a Time.",1426896000,,911,4.796178343949045

6462181,5,B00L1WJGPG,"After years of waiting, we finally have a DVD release for Cybersix! Video and audio are absolutely excellent quality, no compression issues or anything.

6462182,5,B00L1WJGPG,"Above the moonlit streets of a gargoyle-strewn city, a black and crimson clad feminine figure races elegantly across rooftops on a personal quest for survival and justice. She is both a human and nonhuman heroine, beautiful and mysterious. As her story unfolds, her name is revealed to be symbolic of her past but not of the future she hopes to gain, for:

""Deep in my heart
I feel love so alive
In the depths of my soul
I know we will survive.""

This is the beginning of ""Cybersix,"" a unique, short-lived animated television series produced in 1999, and finally released in the United States on DVD in 2014 by Discotek Media. For lovers of animation, this 13 episode series, international in its full hstory, amazing in its execution, is fondly remembered as an all too brief masterwork.

""Cybersix"" relates the tale of an extraordinary woman born from the dark genius of an evil mastermind, Dr. Von Reichter. The result of genetic engineering, she was intended to be a subservient slave to the world domineering machinations of the mad doctor, and branded with the impersonal designation, ""Cyber 6."" But Von Reichter made his creation too well and the artificial being became self-aware, rebelling against his plans for her. As ""Cybersix,"" the remarkable lady struck out on her own, seeking to create a life for herself, away from the sinister circumstances of her birth. To avoid detection from the unnatural forces hunting her, ""Cybersix"" took on the identity of Adrian Siedelman, a male high school teacher of literature in the city of Meridiana. There she found a sense of normality, friendship and even love. But the ties to Dr. von Reichter remained as ""Cybersix,"" and Data 7, a powerful black panther given the mind and memories of a childhood friend by the cruel scientist, strike back again and again at the plots of Von Reichter. These plots are clumsily implemented by the doctor's  goose-stepping son, Jose. As the TV series builds to its explosive climax, ""Cybersix,"" Data 7, fellow teacher Lucas Amato, street kid friend Julian, and teenaged student Lori, all share exciting adventures, many involving the obscene experiments of  Dr. Von Reichter: mutated monsters, brainwashed policemen, a bird invasion; plus encounters with goblins and werewolves all bring danger and menace to Meridiana, but faced courageously by the heroic woman in black.

The ""Cybersix"" TV series is based on a comic serial created by writer Carlos Trillo and artist Carlos Meglia. Originally serialized in Italy in a magazine called Skorpio beginning in 1992, then published in the duo's homeland of Argentina by El Globo Editor beginning in 1993, ""Cybersix"" would go on to also be translated and printed in France. Unfortunately the comic has not had an official English translation but an effort has been made to produce an online English language version of the series which has been featured on You Tube. The comic series is darker and more mature in its content than the animated cartoon thus the tone of the 13 episode show was revised to appeal to a younger audience. The translation from comic to cartoon was not perfect from at least a story perspective. The sometimes lighter approach slightly undercuts the full impact of the overall drama and the conflict between ""Cybersix"" and Dr. Von Reichter with his monsters of the week was repetitive.

But as realized in animation, the ""Cybersix"" series has remained a cherished masterwork due in large part to the participation of the renowned Japanese anime studio, Tokyo Movie Shinsha, currently called TMS Entertainment Co. Ltd. This studio is recognized around the world for the qualityof their animation productions and ""Cybersix"" is a shining example of their work. Perhaps partially inspired by the ""dark deco"" design style of the classic ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" which premiered in 1992, and which the studio contributed animation to 6 early episodes, TMS created a similar dark dimension to the cityscape of ""Cybersix."" While the metropolis of Meridiana is depicted with a European ambiance in the day time, it becomes  a chilling city during the night time escapades of the show's lead character. Colored in blues and blacks, Meridiana is a city of mystery when the moon rises above it, as its statue adorned architecture casts fearful shadows over its narrow streets. Appropriately, the character designs pay respect to the original art style of the story's co-creator, Mr. Meglia. Still, it is the animation of the striking ""Cybersix"" herself that leaves the most lasting impression on the series' audience. Put simply, she is a beautiful figure to watch, and this longtime animation/anime fan has always been awed by the fluidity of her movements thoughout this show. From her dramatic dashes from roof to foof, silhouetted by a huge full moon, her amazing athletic abilities showcased in her battles with the minions of Dr. Von Reichter, to the tender moments of romance growing between her and Lucas Amato, ""Cybersix"" is alluringly animated by TMS. She is also an intriguing, sympathetic and caring character, whose struggle to find a place for herself, free from the evil plans of her creator makes ""Cybersix"" that much more empathetic a character.

The DVD release of ""Cybersix"" for the first time in America thus comes as a much appreciated one by this reviewer, and I'm sure, many other fans who have cherished this series. Discotek Media's 2014 double disc set features the entire 13 episode series and: the original series pilot, audio commentaries on the premiere and concluding episodes, plus a 2 part commentary detailing the background of the ""Cybersix"" saga from comics to cartoon and more.

The ""Cybersix Complete TV Series"" collection comes highly recommended.",1415923200,11,5739,5.082802547770701
6462183,5,B00L1WJGPG,"For 12 years I have been waiting for a replacement of my old VHS Cybersix tapes that have gradually degraded over the years and now it is finally here.  I re-watched the entire series within a few days of receiving this product which contains all the original content as well as some new commentary with drastic improvement in the audio and picture clarity.  It was a moment to relive the nostalgia this cartoon series brought to me as a 10th grader in high school and reminisce what was and could have been great about this series after witnessing the trend animated movies took in the following decade.

The series circles around a protagonist named Cybersix donned in a leather-clad suit, cape and hat with superhuman strength and agility.  She battles the genetically engineered monsters sent to by her arch-nemesis father.  When she isn't fighting, she assumes the role of a male high school teacher.  Among the supporting characters are her co-worker and romantic interest, a panther, a homeless boy and several others who often require the aid of Cybersix and often times help Cybersix in her times of need as well.  Another prominent villain is the comically evil Arch-nemesis' son, though at times he is shown to have a good/human side as well.

Cybersix's main weakness appears to be her emotional sensitivity which affects her ability to fight, live, and make decisions.  The secondary characters help her overcome or console her at times which usually results in a favorable outcome in the middle of the series.  Towards the end, these issues become increasingly amplified and eventually Cybersix is confronted with a situation she cannot run from and will permanently affects those around her.  After watching the entire series though, very strong and realistic connections are made with the audience related to themes of identity, loyalty, loneliness, jealousy, love and sacrifice.

The thematic elements as well as the high detail of the cel animations, the animation style creates a very deep sense of realism.  The city situated in seems very alive, the characters are memorable and rarely do we get a heroine that can kick some serious rear end.  The funny, the sad, and happy moments are always in the right places and in the right quantities in this very original animation.

Sometimes I wonder why this show didn't get more popularity.  Maybe it had something to do with the name of the series being easily confused with an inappropriate word.  Maybe it was the gender role issue regarding the alter-ego of the protagonist that wouldn't sit well with less open minded people.  Maybe it was the adult oriented nature of the comic series that served as the basis of the TV show.  It was unfortunate the series ended with so much questions unanswered and I am not holding out hopes for a continuation of this project.  Regardless, for the time it ran, the TV series treated the franchise with dignity and brought me an unforgettable experience.  Even after so long, being able to own it on DVD still brings me much joy.

Highly recommended for fans and people who may have wanted to know more about the series.",1415145600,6,3128,4.884469696969697
8663307,5,B00L1WJGPG,"It's fantastic to finally have this series on DVD, hell in high quality. I've been wanting to rewatch this series properly. It's just as fantastic as I remember it being. Cybersix has fluid animation, beautiful color palettes, wonderful music, and great writing. It's just one season in total, so there is definitely plot left hanging, which in itself is a bummer. I love this series and wish there was more.

As a heads up, there are no subtitles/captions on this DVD, if you're hearing impaired you're kind of out of luck. The only subtitle options present are for a karaoke section for the main theme.",1523232000,,604,4.752380952380952
8663308,5,B00L1WJGPG,"I was so glad to see this finally on DVD! Cybersix is one of my fave cartoons despite there being so few eps. Unfortunately, there were like no cartoons with strong female leads when this was made, and the network didn't know what to do with it. It was really ahead of its time in a lot of ways. The only thing I can say against the show is that there are some Japanese characters in one episode who are drawn looking like offensive caricatures. But if you can overlook that, it's a beautifully drawn and well-made series that I think if it were made today with all the popular female superheroes, it would have been very successful. I would love to see this story done again at some point, whether animated or live-action. Maybe she could have a movie in the theatres, and then if that does okay, maybe another series? Please?",1478908800,,827,4.411764705882353
8663309,5,B00L1WJGPG,"Such a great series. If you liked Batman the animated series, you will likely love Cybersix. The music, the mood, the style and story are all so, so excellent. I'd love to have so much more. A shame its only 13 episodes, but at least it doesn't feel like it got cut off without a good spot to stop. I'd highly recommend it.",1468195200,,323,4.142857142857143
