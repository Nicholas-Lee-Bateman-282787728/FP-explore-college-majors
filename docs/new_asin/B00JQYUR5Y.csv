8653411,5,B00JQYUR5Y,"If u love quality, these films are old school fun. ""Misfits"" surprised me.  A very decent film that coincidently was the end of several LEGENDS of cinema's  yore. ""Apartment"" I wanted more, Such chauvinism, have to view again perhaps to appreciate. ""Some Like it Hot"" I viewed in Sweden 20 ? years ago. I'm sure it's alright if you get the beats of 60+yrs. ago references etc. I am a geek 4 such. Not to say I get it all, but upon re-viewing a movie can pick up on the social norms or inside gags... Love movies 1940-' 69 or later if not garbage formula that Hollywood sucks so .",1416182400,,579,4.254545454545455
