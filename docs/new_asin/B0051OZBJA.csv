8452982,5,B0051OZBJA,Very nice video presentation- Cuming shows some nice brush handling and walks you through some of his process.  You can get a feel for the atmosphere he paints in with the ocean sounds and so on.  I think this will appeal to all levels of painters from beginner to pro.  He works very loosely almost abstractly with very loose interpretations of the landscape.,1502409600,,360,4.682539682539683
8452983,5,B0051OZBJA,"Loved it -- Have watched it at least eight times. If you're a painted, it's like a workshop. If you just love art, this is a wonderfully entertaining video. Mr. Cuming is terrific at explaining his processes in a humble, no-foolish-artist-lingo way. An amazing talent.",1428710400,2,268,4.977777777777778
