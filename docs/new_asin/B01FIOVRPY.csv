7750034,5,B01FIOVRPY,"The long lost 1973 Animerama film, Belladonna of Sadness, has been released on Blu-ray, courtesy of CineliciousPics, SpectreVision and The Cinefamily.

When the lovely Jeanne is raped several times on her wedding night, she sells her soul to Satan, and becomes the most powerful and beautiful woman in the village. As her husband becomes an empty shell of a man and the black plague descends upon the townsfolk, Jeanne offers to heal the afflicted with her newfound powers. As she totally surrenders to Satan (presented here as a large, talking phallus) she raises the dead and regularly hosts large orgies in the forest. When the lord of the village hears of Jeannes ungodly ways, he sets out to burn the witch to her death.

Belladonna of Sadness is shocking and unforgettable animated experience. It is the last of the Animerama trilogy, which mixed traditional animation with erotic and psychedelic imagery. Belladonna unfolds like a still watercolor painting that occasionally springs to hallucinatory life when you least expect it. The material is undeniably explicit. No doubt, if this film had been submitted to the MPAA, it would have been slapped with an NC-17. The film is presented with a brand new 4K restoration from the original 35mm negative. It includes over eight minutes of previously unreleased material, and this marks the first time that the film has been given an official release in the US. The Blu-ray features interviews with the filmmakers, as well as both red and green band trailers and a booklet.

Belladonna of Sadness is a fascinating film. It many ways, it brings to mind Yellow Submarine and Fantasia, only this is strictly for adults. It is highly recommended! Film buffs should add this Blu-ray to their library immediately.",1465948800,4,1760,5.041237113402062
7750035,5,B01FIOVRPY,"An erotic, psychedelic trauma/revenge story that makes me want to fall in love with the devil. Powerfully cathartic, it is a true. Masterpiece. Like, crying grateful-to-be-alive survivor masterpiece. Also trigger warnings everywhere. Watched at The Cinefamily in LA and I cried for an hour in the car after this film. It was the most beautiful moment of my life.",1465430400,8,362,5.1525423728813555
7750036,5,B01FIOVRPY,"Thanks to Fantastic Fest for bringing this epically sad, beautifully illustrated story of suffering silently & perseverance.
The style reminded me of Bakshi, with many hand-painted backgrounds, scrolled across slowly, with figures efficiently animated.
Belladonna is a haunting piece of high art, finally recovered from obscurity - watch it if you are a fan of animation or soulful expression.",1464134400,6,393,5.677966101694915
7750037,5,B01FIOVRPY,"THIS IS TO BE EXPERINCED EITHER BY YOURSELF OR IN A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE JUST AS WEIRD AS YOU! While absolutely stunning art work and a plot that really does make you think (persecution, judgment of women, abuse of women). This is really a work all of its own and once you see it you understand why it was never really released out into the US. It is very graphic for adults but to a kid it would look like a bunch of little mushrooms dancing around in circles and they'd probably would be just very, very confused by many of the scenes.
To any adults that want to watch it, to wow any of your college professors I would HIGHLY suggest using this as an essay topic to write about. One of my favorites and yet so completely mind boggling!",1463356800,16,736,4.190140845070423

It's a little pricey but it's way more pricey on eBay so needless to say this was a real score!",1483660800,,242,4.5227272727272725
7750041,5,B01FIOVRPY,Bizzare and thought provoking. I can easily see why this was so highly recommended among certain circles.,1481587200,,105,5.235294117647059

7750043,5,B01FIOVRPY,"An amazing piece of art and film that we may never experience ever again in our lifetime. This film is art but also a movie. It's an anime but not the kind that people think of.
For the sake of trying not to spoil the movie I will try to not to tell the whole story nor go into great detail.
It's about a woman who fell in love got married and lived on a poor land run by an heartless king. The king collected money from the poor village and even used some women's bodies. After all that the main character jeanne wants to help her husband by making deals with demons which in turn make her look like something worse in the eyes of the people and even her husband. She goes on a trip to become something. Something that doesn't seem to be of this world all for the one she loves. Warning there is some sexuality and also some trippy beautiful effects. You will have to watch yourself and the story is easy to understand but it's not the kind of movie you can find any where else it's something that we may never experience again in the movie or the animated world.",1477180800,4,1064,4.144927536231884
7750044,5,B01FIOVRPY,"A very different and singular movie, far removed from what one thinks of for Anime. If your looking for a something else in animation, here you go",1476576000,,146,4.444444444444445
7750045,4,B01FIOVRPY,"An amazing film and  a terrific remaster. There are few technical issues that should have been noticed, but nothing that ever distracts from the movie. For instance, I was cycling through the audio options and noticed that the Japanese audio was listed as English. My PS3 could not play this disc but my PS4 could, so definitely test the disc to make sure your player will support it. Other than that, I would say I definitely recommend this printing.",1475712000,,451,4.708860759493671
7750046,5,B01FIOVRPY,"the artistry is superb, the music tells a story",1475625600,,47,4.333333333333333
7750047,5,B01FIOVRPY,"This movie is an interesting study on 70s feminist movement in Japan and i get the impression in the international world.  Since generally when a movie is odd and low budget it goes into film festivals and is played to the art film crowd and not the common folks that just want to see Ironman and Captain America sword fight.

This movie though is in many ways i believe miss represented, I'm a huge rape revenge movie fan, and wanted to see this movie cause the animation looked pretty, but when i read the description and learned it is a ""rape revenge"" i bought a ticket and saw it at the local movie theater (Alamo).  And yes, there is a horrific rape scene when the film starts, but the movie gets past the act of rape which many rape revenges can't even fathom and is about a woman trying to once again become someone after this horrible act was done upon her.  And she gains power, from herself worth. Which when she first meets the little guy is small, but as she gains power and self worth he grows bigger.  and one of the most interesting parts is herself worth is represented as a male phallic, but at the film progresses he vanishes as she comes into her full power as a woman.  she transitions from seeing her self worth through the eyes of a man and seeing through her own.

Now the revenge part happens to be more of a happen stance of her situation rather then a full thought out plan.  One of the people that attacked her asks for her help.  she gives him help and then when he fulfills his fantasy he's struck down.  Wasn't her fault that his plan would piss off everyone in the kingdom that mattered, he wanted to do it, she just aided him.

You should see this movie if you aren't easily offended, happen to love mix media animation, love 70s Japanese pop music,and want to see something simply different.",1474416000,2,1824,4.351032448377581
7750048,5,B01FIOVRPY,It is really tamed by today's starndard andd it holds so much meaning and will make you feel and see things differently.,1472774400,,120,4.5
7750049,4,B01FIOVRPY,"This is an animated film, but boy oh boy is it NOT a film for children! To be sure, children probably wouldnt understand iteverything is very symbolicbut it oozes sex and violence, including a rape scene, in ways that are all the more effective for being heavily metaphorical and, yes, quite beautiful.

Ive never seen anything quite like this movie, and Im not sure whether I would ever want to again but Im glad Criterion rescued it from oblivion. Sadness is much too mild and limp-wristed a word for what the medieval heroine, Jeanne, feels, and is entitled to feel; rage would be more like it. My only objection to the film is that she didn't get to apply nearly as much of that rage as I would have liked, although she did succeed in reclaiming her sexuality and putting it to her own uses for a while. The film is a powerful and lyrical statement about both the abuse and the inner strength of women.",1472169600,2,906,4.457831325301205
7750050,5,B01FIOVRPY,Not for the faint of heart thats for sure.. really great soundtrack and visuals (i.e. the background animations working with the water colours) can't wait to check out the others in this trilogy,1471564800,,194,4.909090909090909
7750051,5,B01FIOVRPY,"Before i go in to detail, belladonna means ""beautiful women"". I didn't heard of take word until when i first saw the cover of this movie. Belladonna of Sadness is film that's been not seen over 40 years in America ever until May 6, 2016. But that wasn't the problem. It was produced by a japanese animation studio Mushi Production, other films take he had made were ""A Thousand and One Nights, Cleopatra and Belladonna of Sadness. By Osamu Tezuka who also wrote manga like Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, Black Jack, Phoenix, Buddha, Ambassador Magma, Metropolis, and others. As i said, when i first saw the blu-ray box at Amoeba Records, i was i bit curious to know what this movie is about cause i like anime movies, and i enjoy anime from Hayao Miyazaki. I bought a copy of the movie and watched it as i got back from the store. I watched the full movie that day, to find the movie fantastic. I never seen a movie like this style. Wot's to say about it. So the story is about Jeanne and Jean are happy newlyweds in a rural village. They just got married at the church, only Jeanne gets raped by the local baron and his lackeys. Jean couldn't really do anything to help and gets left out. She comes home weak, she plans for revenge on the baron, i wouldn't spoil the whole movie cause that's just mean. Let's just say that things don't go when for the village. The movie is like a stairway to hell (instead like stairway to heaven). What makes the movie so wonderful is the animation, the music and the idea of the story with it. It's a bit sad that the movie was considered to be lost in the old days until it was release in 4K digital restoration for a theatrical release in 2016. The movie only had a 86 minutes run instead of the 93 minute run. The company who took the movie for the blu-ray disc on home medias is Cinelicious Pics. I really don't know why they didn't release the full movie at this time for some reason. It mostly takes place of a satanism and witchcraft area where the old times people really believe in that. As of me i don't. The movie is great, i really recommends this one. The movie is not rated but it's rated R or X (probably from the old days). For Intense scenes, Pervasive Sexual content, nudity, and weird images. That's really all of it. Some viewers may not even to be going to finish the movie cause of it's images and sex and that stills show the sign that people have different ideas.
This is pretty much one of the best movies i have every seen.",1471392000,6,2488,4.2957446808510635
7750052,5,B01FIOVRPY,"Belladonna of Sadness has been brilliantly restored by Cinelicous Pics, a new company similar to Criterion, who have given the film it's first official U.S. release. They have clearly taken every measure possible to ensure that this film has been given the release it so rightfully deserves, going so far to have it shown in theaters across the country a few months back, and will releasing a companion book later on this month. Even the case looks as if it were a work of art. The film's new 4K restoration is breathtaking, and  comes with several bonus features, my favorites being Dennis Bartok's essay ""Belladonna of Sadness: Lost and Found."" I greatly appreciate this release and am glad to see they've given such respect to an animated film, I can only hope that they might release Tokuma Shoten's Angel's Egg in the future.",1471219200,4,830,4.804195804195804
7750053,5,B01FIOVRPY,"This movie was not what I was expecting it to be. It was amazing. Such a work of art, the colors are beautiful, just watching something remastered from the 70's is mind blowing. It is very sexually graphic so I would not reccomend for childern 18+ in my opinion, but hey do as you please in your own home. If you have the extra cash to spend and you love old school anime, please spend the money and keep it for your collection. It worth the money. My copy arrived in 2 days, in good shape, and played well on my ps4! Good luck! Hope this helps!",1470268800,2,545,4.102803738317757
7750054,3,B01FIOVRPY,"Although I didn't really expect to see as much of  whatever was hinted at in the previews, it still wasn't worth neither the time nor the the cost. The artwork was the expected ""moving-manga"" style but there was more still action than hoped for. It is worth a passing view if your friend has a copy but nothing much beyond that. However, in it's day, in the early '70's, it probably had a bigger impact but, today, not really that much.",1469750400,,436,4.382716049382716
7750055,1,B01FIOVRPY,"It's probably a great film but disc won't play.  Bought this disc for someones birthday.  Pre ordered.  Arrived.  Won't play in PS3.  Spend two hours screwing around with settings, updating firmware etc.  No luck.  Take it over to friends house with non-PS3 Blu-ray.  Won't play there either.  Won't even load.  Returns error.  Order replacement.  Arrives.  Same problem.  Second disc won't play in either device.  Both PS3 and Sony blu-ray will play other blu-ray discs without any issues.  Finding it hard to believe I'm the only one getting bad discs.  Nothing on the Amazon site about there being a problem.  Would just get my money back but it was a present to someone else so now I'm stuck trying to find a working copy of a rare film. Grrrr......",1469750400,5,753,4.75
7750056,3,B01FIOVRPY,"Belladonna of Sadness is a 1973 Japanese film that attempted to introduce more adult content into animation. Directed and co-written by Eiichi Yamamoto, the film focuses on Jeanne, a beautiful peasant woman who is raped and beaten on her wedding night by the evil Milord and his attendants. She accepts a proposition from a demon to surrender herself to sensuality, which up to that point has been dormant. As her erotic impulse grows, so, too, does the demon, eventually assuming a gigantic phallic shape.

Apart from its R-rated subject matter, the film is stylistically striking, with a series of watercolor still paintings transforming into other images, to mesmerizing effect. The story is its secondary appeal, since deals-with-the-Devil tales have been popular subject matter for movies going back to silent days. Its the imageswhich still rank among the most sexually graphic in filmthat will have you opening your eyes in amazement. Some sequences are reminiscent of the pop-art style of Yellow Submarine, made five years earlier, with late 60s fashions, bright colors, and inventive creatures. But other scenes are disturbing and intended primarily to shock.

The film was a financial disaster when initially released, bankrupting the pioneering Japanese animation studio Mushi. The Blu-ray release contains a new restoration of the original camera negative. Additional material censored from the negative was recovered using a 35-mm print from the Belgian film archives. The colors  particularly red  are vibrant and enhance the overall weirdness and unsettling nature of the film. Not for everyone, Belladonna of Sadness is animation that challenges viewers with erotic images that would have been impossible to show in live action pictures of the period.

Bonus extras include over 8 minutes of footage cut from the original 35-mm camera negative; new video interviews with director Eiichi Yamamoto, art director Kuni Fukai, and composer Masahiko Satoh; trailers; and a 16-page booklet with a critical essay.",1468627200,3,2021,5.444089456869009
7750057,5,B01FIOVRPY,"My Review and Thoughts:

Cinelicious Pics has brought out a true anime masterpiece. They have crafted this truly one of a kind anime on a lovely Blu-ray experience. An all new 4K restoration that is breathtaking and beyond words, you have to see it to believe it.

This is one of those forgotten about classic animated films. It's a film that is a one-of-a-kind, unique, very diverse, very artistic, very intense, very graphic. To me it's one of the great masterpieces of anime in existence. If you have not seen this anime it's very hard to explain and very hard to grasp the Ultimate Reality of the story. The Animation is truly an artistic Beauty that stands out above and beyond a lot of other anime films. To me this is one of the most unique masterpieces of anime that has ever been created. Thankfully this is coming out on a wonderful high quality Blu-ray that I highly recommend. The film has never looked this great.

A passionate and wonderful example of how to treat an important piece of anime film history. This Blu-ray gives a new transfer, high definition, amazing audio and video. It is vibrant in color and artistically sound in the way the movie originally was.

The plot to Belladonna of Sadness is a rough and brutal reality. Your main character Jeanne is happily a newly web with Jean. They live in a rural village. Sadly, on her wedding night she is raped by the local Baron and his group of bad guys. So begins a spiraling downward of reality. Soon Jeanne has visions of a spirit. That spirit grants her special happenings. As the baron returns from war Jeanne who has a new found purpose and respect is accused of being a witch, and is banished from the village. Soon Jeanne finds herself along side her spirit in a new purpose.

The movie is based on the book Satanism and Witchcraft by author Jules Michelet. Director Eiichi Yamamoto co-wrote the screenplay for the film. Yamamoto needs no introduction to true movie lovers. He is a master director and writer of Anime. From the classic, original Astro Boy to my personal favorite 1966s Kimba the White Lion. He was a true master at capturing reality to his anime. He was able to transcend an emotional undertaking into his anime films that made you the viewer feel for the character, and also the horrors, or realities taking place. As of this writing he is still alive but retired. He left a great array of anime to enjoy and the passionate, powerful example of that brilliance is Belladonna of Sadness.

Belladonna of Sadness is an ultimate trip into an odd world. The music soundtrack is an intense, avant-garde smack in the senses, that add a unique story in itself. The brutal reality of the subject matter mixed with the intensity of Masahiko Satohs soundtrack leaves the viewers ultimately exhausted, and that is part of its brilliance.

Newly restored by Cinelicious Pics using the original 35mm camera negative. Adding in over 8 minutes that original was cut from the feature. An utterly fantastic, trippy, experience like nothing you have ever seen. Belladonna of Sadness is a true masterpiece of animation that gives the darkness along with the light. You experience the deep, twisted nature of humanity and also the darkest reality of clarity one can ever experience.

Overall:

This is a must own experience. Cinelicious Pics has created a Blu-ray worthy to praise and experience. This is a highly recommend Blu-ray, in my viewpoint its a must own for any lover of cinema, for Belladonna of Sadness is an experience like no other.",1466553600,13,4144,4.8609929078014185
8760846,4,B01FIOVRPY,"This is the type of movie that you aren't sure how to rate and publically talk about due to the oh-so-70s gratuitous sexploitation. Thats the only reason I would knock down a star. But with that said the nudity serves a purpose. Anyone who knows anything about the craft can appreciate the first encounter Are you the devil? I am you. I really care not for the relationship being with a Satanic figure but that is always symbolic of the innate inner power inside that is sexual, alive and hard to wrangle by an aristocracy. I will give the sexual violence a bit of a pass because it really makes a statement about how men handle raped women, culturally their voices are strangled into silence and they have to figure out how to get it together by themselves because people around them don't want to experience the shame of being responsible for letting it happen and because admitting that you let your woman get beaten or raped by men more powerful and more resourced than you makes you realize your own weakness and it makes you lose face if you don't go along with the system and just pretend it never happened. And most of all it wakes you up out of a fairytale. We often forget how often normal husbands beat their wives and used their wives ingenuity for emotional and financial gain because women had no rights. This movie goes there. Most movies don't deal with this or the fact that people who sell their souls, might get abused by spirits, but have been abused by mortal men even more. There is something to say about the Devil being a Flying fallus as there is a social price for being a true free spirit.",1527465600,,1616,4.462837837837838
8760847,5,B01FIOVRPY,"A fantastic film with a lot to say but because of its nature it is also not a title for many people.
First off you have the pornographic elements which will already turn most people off. It's not as though it's porn, either. There is a structured narrative in place, and a damn good one, but getting passed the graphic nature is going to be hard for most and it's not going to draw in a lot of people on that basis, alone, so I'm guessing most will probably tap out damn near immediately.
Second is the fact that it's animated. This is clearly an adult title but the target audience will most definitely brush it off because it's not live action. In Mexico, it's a little different, we are probably more accepting of something of this nature and if you're an anime fan you're probably already used to being willing to experience abstract stories or less than your everyday normalcy in your animation, but for a 'general audience' viewer this is a bit like jumping into the deep end and probably won't be able to stick around long enough to appreciate the movie dismissing it as a cartoon and thus unable to take it seriously.
Lastly, the abstract nature of the film, which is probably going to be too heavy for most. This is a rather psychedelic movie and if you can get behind that then more power to ya, but more than just that the movie is full of other forms of abstract metaphors, stylized visuals and narrative that I don't know if it would fall under the 3 act structure, I'll have to get back to you on that.
With all that being said, if you can get through the movie, give it a fair chance, you'll find a fascinating story told in an equally fascinating way. A rather unique experience but one you should look into before you commit to it.",1525996800,,1748,4.381538461538462

8760850,5,B01FIOVRPY,I bought this on a whim and did not know what to expect. Luckily it ended up being up my alley but this really is not for everyone. It is like an art film and it is very tragic.  It is also a bit old and not going to appeal to your average anime viewer.,1510617600,,253,3.6
