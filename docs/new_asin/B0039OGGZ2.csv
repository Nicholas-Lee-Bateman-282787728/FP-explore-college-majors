I ejected it from dvd player to watch a better movie the list f how crappy this movie is a long long LONG list buy it at your own risk",1510617600,,470,3.806122448979592
8392162,4,B0039OGGZ2,"When Liz finally took charge and killed the crazy one of the two flunkies, I thought, finally.  When she reconnected with her lover, I said, yeah.  Then she started to carry out what her lover requested, and I thought, yea.  When the two lovers rode away in the cliched Paris sunset with the very expensive, and cleverly hidden jewel, I said, good movie.",1366243200,3,354,4.587301587301587
8392163,1,B0039OGGZ2,"I feel as though I've seen this film- or something like it- several times before. The idea is not very original
and has been done better before. It's obviously low budget and the actors are terrible.
 There is a cynical attempt to create a sleazy interest through a forced lesbian subplot..its tacked on and the women are unattractive.
 This is not worth your time or money.",1274054400,13,374,4.651515151515151
8392164,4,B0039OGGZ2,"Starring Alan Ford, this dark British thriller was a great find. Fast paced with some sharp twists and turns and some snappy humour, a brilliant night in! Well recommended",1271808000,4,171,4.931034482758621
