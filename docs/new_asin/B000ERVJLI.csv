8113691,1,B000ERVJLI,You can get the COMPLETE series including seasons 9 and 11 at Best buy for $224.99.,1275177600,,83,4.25
8113692,4,B000ERVJLI,"Absolutely my favorite sit-com.  I would have given it 5 stars, but for some strange reason, this is an incomplete ""Complete Season"".  Seasons 9 and 10 were not included- ?????  Other than that mess up, I say that this is one of the best, witty and amazingly written family comedy that I had ever watched.",1269129600,,305,4.509090909090909
8113693,4,B000ERVJLI,"This set is packaged in the fold-out type cases. The only drawback I have noticed is that not all of the DVDs have a ""play all"" feature, so you end up having to start each episode individually from the start menu. Kind of a pain, but not enough to stop me from being happy with this purchase. Visual and sound quality is fine. One of the best shows ever! I am so glad to have this series in my home to watch whenever the mood strikes.",1258070400,,434,4.058139534883721
8113694,5,B000ERVJLI,"I have always admired Kelsey Grammar because of his multi talented personality, he plays a number  of personalities with grace and ease, and yet, all perfectly fascinating!  I think Frazier is the best role he has ever done and paired with his equally snobblish but lovable brother, Niles, expertly played by the Emmy winning David Hyde Price, makes for hours of great entertaining.  Jane Leeves & Peri Gilpin are superb comedic actresses, and John Mahoney is in a class by himself!  I also like the fact that the visiting actors are always already famous in their own right.  Oh, and let us not forget ""Eddie""!",1224288000,,611,4.780952380952381
8113695,5,B000ERVJLI,"This is a true collection, each season is in the original packaging, not in a money saving, value pack that falls apart when you open it (which is odd since Paramount is who usually does that, like with Star Trek TNG).  As far as the show goes?  If you are looking to purchase this, I assume you have seen it before.

Well worth the price, if you are a fan you should own this set.",1206230400,,381,4.053333333333334
8113696,5,B000ERVJLI,"The whole set is just great! I love the show. The set is as showed in the pictures, each set has its own box with fold-in 4 disc holders.",1187827200,,137,3.7586206896551726
8113697,1,B000ERVJLI,"I love frasier !  When I saw this listing i thought how convienient ! It looked like all seasons were individually bought so you would get the little booklet with each dvd as to the names of all the eppisodes and a little blurb about all !  Well i got all the dvds in what looks like a cd book just all the disks in that i could flip page by page with disks , no book with the eppisodes , not cases for each season ..... im very very upset and the photo shown here is very descieving !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  does anyone know if i can return to sender ?????????",1184544000,4,565,4.118181818181818
8113698,5,B000ERVJLI,My husband loves to watch Frasier on Lifetime.  We did not watch the series when it originally came out so we are enjoying watching it from the beginning.  I purchased this gift for him and he loves it. There aren't many good comedys on television anymore. The price was great considering that the cost of a season is between $27-$30 dollars and when purchased with this set it was less than $23 per season.,1182384000,,407,4.486486486486487
8113699,5,B000ERVJLI,"I love the item, I hate the price.  What a joke.  You can buy each season at Wal-Mart for $19.96.  That comes to $179.64 for the 9 seasons.  Unreal.  That is almost $100.00.

I am shocked.  I usually can't say enough good things about Amazon.  But this one is bad.",1176336000,15,264,4.14
8113700,5,B000ERVJLI,I had been looking for Frasier DVD's all over and was finding only 1 or 2 seasons on other websites.  I was so thrilled to find all nine seasons together and for a better price than I found anywhere else.,1173571200,5,204,4.1
