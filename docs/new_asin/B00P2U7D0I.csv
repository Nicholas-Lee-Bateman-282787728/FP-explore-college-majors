8686287,5,B00P2U7D0I,Brought tears as I listened.  The comparison of the final movement of the 3rd Mahler of this performance to Abbado's own was stark: the sorrow was felt in this version whereas the joy and celebration was evident in the Abbado.  I have no problem with the editing as this is about Abbado and not just a performance of works.  A fitting and grand tribute to a conductor and musician who touched so many.,1467072000,,401,4.465753424657534
8686288,5,B00P2U7D0I,"This blu-ray is a little scary as it starts out with the orchestra playing Schubert's Unfinished symphony without a conductor.  They said they had just rehearsed it with Abbado and played it the way he would have directed it.
Just so happens that I love this piece of music, and this turns out to me, to be the best version I have ever heard.
AWESOME MUSIC!!!!!!
The remainder of the disc is not quite as breathtaking, and to my mind does not quite live up to the Schubert.
Still it is highly recommended, the sound and picture are GREAT!!!!",1436745600,,541,4.4646464646464645

8686290,3,B00P2U7D0I,"i don't like Andris Nelsons....is like a clown, Terrible for a memorial......Poor Claudio Abbado!
And Gantz toooo long",1425600000,3,118,5.611111111111111
8686291,2,B00P2U7D0I,"The producers of this memorial to a great conductor, played by his great orchestra, have ruined what seems to have been an extraordinary concert. They have included interviews/voiceovers which totally obscure the openings of the Berg Concerto and of the finale of Mahler's Third Symphony. The result is a travesty which reveals their utter lack of both musical taste and of human sensitivity to the memory of the conductor. If the music were played without the voiceovers this would rate a 5.",1423699200,20,492,5.012195121951219
8686292,3,B00P2U7D0I,"A nice tribute .  But a serious mistake is made by the producers in placing voice-overs  over the opening of the Mahler 3rd  last movement and the Berg violin concerto .
Isabelle Faust, Wolfram Christ and others speak very movingly  and eloquently about Abbado , but it is almost a crime that these words have been allowed to  intrude upon the music ,.  The conductorless  Schubert  Unfinished ( 1st movement only stunningly played) is ,  thank God,  played without intrusion, however the decision of the producer to place voice-overs and documentary footage over the other orchestral works is so wrong-headed. Surely Abbado , of all people , would have said Just let the music speak for itself. Having said that ,  both the Berg Violin Concerto and the Mahler under Andris Nelsons are beautifully played.  Sound quality and visuals are excellent.",1423526400,19,847,4.929078014184397
8686293,5,B00P2U7D0I,I must mention that this wonderful memorial concert is not a region B/2 bluray. It is a 0 and playable worldwide. I don't know why Amazon decided to represent it as generally unplayable in North America.,1422403200,8,203,4.666666666666667
