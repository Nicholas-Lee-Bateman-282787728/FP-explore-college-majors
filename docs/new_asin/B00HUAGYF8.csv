6208718,5,B00HUAGYF8,"Just wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed this movie.  I had seen it once on PBS and thought it was very good.  So, I wanted to have it in my Movie collection.  It plays very well.  The Actors all did a wonderful job.  Loved it!!  Thank you.",1398297600,,246,3.82
6208719,2,B00HUAGYF8,"A good period Sherlocky detective intro to the science of forensic investigation of crimes. Script, acting, directing, sets, etc. start out well and for most of the movie it has a nice authentic flow but then the creative juices must have run out because the ending (and near ending scenes) lost focus, energy, intrigue and denouement.",1398124800,7,335,5.0
6208720,5,B00HUAGYF8,"Okay, first a note and suggestion:  I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical or TV version here as well as review of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by Most Recent first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to my review of the DVD (non-Bluray) version. As I understand it the bonus features are the same on both the DVD and BD for this release

This film was created by Carnival Films, the leading independent producer of films in the UK which are broadcast there on the BBC. It recently aired on PBS in the UK but in an edited form. I did not see the PBS version but the package of the DVD states clearly Original UK Edition and, at 93 minutes, it would not have fit into the PBS 85 minute time slot. Just as importantly, there  are enough graphic images of severed body parts, blood and brief full nudity (though of dead bodies) that viewers with weak stomachs should be aware of these scenes. Still, I loved this film.

Ill leave a few other reviewers to discuss the details of the plot  though I don't like spoilers. This is not so much as a mystery as a Police procedural drama (the words used by the Director in the bonus feature on the DVD).  If the TV series CSI were taking place in the war years of 1940s London (with bombs being dropped daily and fallout shelters being the norm), this would be an episode of CSI  The war years.  There is great chemistry (no pun intended, really!) between the lead characters  the pathologist (Patrick Kennedy) and his former news reporter turned assistant( Tazmin Merchant).  As the film ends and the case is resolved (though not exactly as the viewer might hope for), it looks like there could be future cases.  And, in fact there is. Well at least one. Though the package does not reveal this, an Internet search revealed that this was the first of a two-part series, Hopefully, the second part will be available shortly and released by PBS Home Video in the original UK version as well.

The DVD has one bonus feature. It is a six-minute behind the scenes featurette with the director, scenic designer and cast members. While not essential to enjoying the film, I found it useful to watch.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6208722,3,B00HUAGYF8,"To answer the question was luminol available during WWII - yes, it was developed in 1937 as a presumptive test for blood, so the science for it was around in 1940 WWII London.  I don't know how widely used it would have been, but it was available.  This TV show kept my attention, but as with many TV programs made now about the past, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries comes to mind, they feel the need to put a politically correct spin on it when there was no such thing in those days.  Homosexuality was a crime in the 1940s and most people thought it a perversion and were not accepting of it.  Yet again, the two main characters tell the character Terry that there's nothing wrong with his paying male prostitutes for sex.  Most people would have been appalled at such behavior in those days because they weren't exposed to it like we are today.  Good grief, at least make it believable for the era!  **SPOILER ALERT - IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE AND WANT TO BE SURPRISED, DON'T READ WHAT FOLLOWS**  I also find it hard to believe that as smart as Molly was that she would have gone off with the killer away from everyone else in the tube station.",1393027200,53,1150,4.366197183098592
6208723,3,B00HUAGYF8,"I saw this program on PBS so I cannot comment on the quality of the DVD, only on the quality of the drama.  In London during the Blitz, a forensic scientist and his female assistant investigate the serial killings of young women.  The production did a good job of evoking the era with seemingly accurate replication of the period's clothing, radio, and music  and convincing portrayal of the terror of the air raids.  The actors, though entirely unknown to me (surprising since I watch a lot of UK-produced TV), were all competent. Since it hinged on forensics, the plot was more police procedural than whodunit.  Thankfully, unlike too many CSI-type US TV shows I've seen, the science was clearly explicated and the solution to the crime unfolded logically and was credible.  To add an extra fillip of conflict to the storyline, the interests of pure justice were placed in conflict with the interests of the war effort.  If this all sounds rather familiar to fans of Foyle's War, no surprise.  Replace older, wiser Foyle and young, eager Sam with young, smart Dr. Collins and young, eager Molly and move them from Hastings to London and you've got Murder on the Home Front.  The problem is, neither the main characters nor the cast of suspects is anywhere near as compelling as Michael Kitchen and Honeysuckle Weeks and their panoply of guest stars.  A heads-up for parents (and the squeamish), there are some fairly grisly scenes in the early going.",1392940800,33,1452,4.818548387096774
6208724,2,B00HUAGYF8,"Murder on the Home Front, 2010 film

Dr. Collins is called to investigate a murder. [Does that room have too many lights for wartime?] He tests the body for rigor mortis. ""Collect the trace evidence."" A young woman looks in (she is not upset). Miss Cooper is a crime reporter, she is taken to the morgue where the body is examined. There is a cut on the victim's tongue. [Post mortem?] Miss Cooper is offered a job as an assistant, she takes it. Miss Cooper is used as a model. Locard's ""exchange principal"" can provide accurate information. They find a ticket to a theater. The detective questions the people there. Another body is found in the morning. Her tongue was also cut! The Government wants little publicity and a quick solution. That soldier arrives at the morgue; a morphine overdose. [Would a woman go hatless then?] Later another body was found! [Would a man go hatless?]

A witness tells about a famous actor who was seen in that area. Luminol identifies bloodstains. [Was it available around 1940?] Ziegler is charged with the murders, he has pictures of ""art studies"". Does that gas mask have a clue? Terry won't talk now. A newspaper prints the story. How did they find out? At night three men in gas masks attack Dr. Collins! He gathers evidence from these masks. They learn about one suspect. The next day a woman's body is found in a canal. They learn more about that refugee. One detective is reassigned after asking questions. A gas mask is delivered to Dr. Collins; he finds earwax. Molly visits that caf and is seen. Outside there is an air raid and bombing. They find something in that ear wax sample! People seek shelter in the subway. A man leads Molly into a deserted area. Can she be saved? Or will she caught by that suspect? What if the strangler is protected by a Government agency? [Unbelievable!] Ziegler will be interned on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien.

Aside from the implausible plot, this provides a look at forensic science circa 1940. It shows how politics can determine guilt rather than the facts! How many innocent accused were convicted then hanged? Its not just ""human error"" when government agents frame someone to protect the guilty. [Tom Mooney and others.] Sir Bernard Spilsbury was famous in the earlier 20th century for giving testimony that sent many men to the gallows. After his suicide a review of his cases raised doubts about many of the convictions. This may explain why Great Britain abolished the death penalty for murder. If there is such a rush to hanging just weeks after conviction this shows a weakness in their system, not the death penalty. No Supreme Court to order a Miranda warning or a Brady ruling, no automatic appeal for review.

The ""Sherlock Holmes"" stories pioneered in the use of trace evidence (circumstantial evidence) to solve crimes. But A. Conan Doyle pointed out that ""a stick points in two directions"". Circumstantial evidence is valid only when correctly applied. Fingerprint evidence has been known to be forged since the 1920s. [A reference in a book about the Hall-Mills case or the murder of Sir Harry Oakes.] Could a valued cryptologist also be a serial killer? No, it is too implausible. If true, he would have been confined and controlled if only to prevent a security breach. Who knows what other crazy thing he could do? Would a serial killer also make a clever cryptanalyst?",1392681600,5,3377,4.738095238095238
6208725,3,B00HUAGYF8,"Murder on the Home Front was inspired by a book of the same name by Molly Lefebure, originally published in 1955 as Evidence for the Crown. Miss Lefebure served as secretary and assistant to the pioneering English pathologist Dr. Keith Simpson during World War II and wrote this memoir about her experiences. This made-for-TV film production was evidently inspired by the book, but the names have been changed, and the story has presumably been fictionalized. I have not read the book, so I cannot say if this plot was inspired by a true story, but it so closely resembles other recent British serial killer plots that I very much doubt it.

In 1941, during the London Blitz, Molly Cooper (Tamzin Merchant) is a reporter for the South London Gazette who aspires to write crime fiction. When the murdered body of Mary Williams is found in a bombed-out building, Molly chases down the Home Office pathologist Dr. Lennox Collins (Patrick Kennedy) for an interview. When he notices her strong constitution, he asks her to be his secretary instead. Molly agrees and becomes entangled too deeply in a serial murder case of women found strangled with a swastika carved into their tongues. Police Detective Inspector Freddy Wilkins (David Sturzaker) appreciates Collins help but is pressured to make an arrest as soon as possible.

This is a hackneyed 21st century plot, and the characters behavior is so anachronistic that its grating. Every British serial killer plot of the past few years seems exactly the same and equally implausible. Murder on the Home Front is like a mid-century CSI crossed with any geek-crimesolver drama, with heaping doses of 21st century socio-political fashion thrown in. Dr. Collins is a nerd obsessed with obscure details and possessed of superhuman powers of observation. Molly is far too familiar with her boss. She was poorly cast and has no charm whatsoever. The story becomes more compelling as it progresses, but this is a patchwork of clichs. Its unfortunate that the writers took the easy path, because the source material is interesting.",1392595200,5,2070,5.032069970845481
6208726,5,B00HUAGYF8,"In this stylish and jazzy 1940's wartime London mystery, a woman is found strangled with a swatztika carved on her tongue. Young pathologist Lennox Collins (Patrick Kennedy) is called to the scene of her dodgy rooming house.  An eager and intrepid young woman reporter, Molly Cooper (Tamzin Merchant), sidles her way into the crime scene to scoop the story.  When she confesses she wants to be a crime writer, Dr. Collins lets her become his assistant at his lab.  Amidst the bombs of the blitz, more strangled women are found.  Is a Nazi Strangler loose?  Pathologist Collins needs to find the culprit using the science in the developing forensics field before an innocent man is hung for the crime.  Why is the government so keen to call this crime solved?  Is it merely to avoid bad headlines, or is the plot more twisted?

Collins is socially awkward and Molly is a gee-whiz, wide-eyed girl reporter.  Together they have a certain symmetry.  This is a lighthearted, stylized frolic for anglophiles and British mystery lovers.  While it has the same backdrop as FOYLE'S WAR, it is much more insouciant.  The plot is clever and all the characters had intriguing faces.  Whoever did the casting had some fun.  If you want an escape to wartime London with a mystery to solve, this just may be the ticket. 4.5 stars.",1392508800,102,1315,4.761061946902655

6208787,3,B00HUAGYF8,"The plot has been described elsewhere, so this is my two-cents on why this deserves 3 stars. The most interesting part of this drama was the 1940s era forensics. We've become so used to CSI-type dramas that it was fun to get a peek at police procedure before science was widely used in investigations - back when politics and circumstantial evidence played a heavy hand in convictions.

The setting was well done for a WWII period piece. The detail in the hair, clothes, set props (labels on cartons, etc.) was top-notch. I also appreciated the fact that they didn't rely on CGI for the blackouts, aerial shots, and bombing sequences. Sometimes using set models and 'shaking the camera' feels amateurish, but in this case it created atmosphere and worked really well. Overall the look and feel of this drama was really well done.

That said...

This was a little grittier than I've come to expect for PBS dramas. There is female nudity (topless corpses) and the autopsy room is pretty graphic. I'm not generally squeamish, but I did find myself cringing a few times at the morgue sequences. I could have done without the severed tongue in a box.

This also has a modern spin on a period piece. For example, the attitudes towards homosexuality are decidedly modern. On the one hand I appreciate not having to sit through prejudice and bigotry, but on the other hand it was a little annoying to have modern attitudes superimposed on a 1940s era. I wish they had gone for accuracy and just left the homosexual subplot out - it didn't add anything to the story.

The acting was okay, but seemed a little stereotyped. The police officers were so generic that I couldn't tell them apart. Molly (Tamzin Merchant - Henry VIII's 5th wife on ""The Tudors"") was spunky, but not very interesting. The medical examiner (Patrick Kennedy - Bleak House) was good in the role - but unfortunately there have been so many shows with brilliant, quirky medical examiners that I felt like I wasn't watching anything new. He was almost too modern to be believable. Overall I'd say the acting was average - no-one was awful, but no-one was memorable either.

The other downside was that it was predictable. It's almost like the 1940s took a back seat and instead the producers tried to hard for shock value - nudity, violence, and the homosexual storyline - but underneath the flash there wasn't much substance. It was entertaining enough to hold my attention, but not anything I'd want to watch again. This is no-where near the quality and caliber of The Bletchley Circle. I would have enjoyed it more had they stuck with the era they chose and not tried for a modern spin.",1423440000,5,2649,4.7105831533477325

6208808,4,B00HUAGYF8,"I seem to have viewed some incredible number of mystery/ crime thriller movies and series. They tend to run together but this one stood out if only for the WWII bombing of London backdrop.

Here's the scoop. It's 1940 and there are nightly bombing raids on London by the Nazis. The citizens are beginning to find it little more than an annoyance. But after one raid a murder victim is found. A pathologist is brought in. He's second tier but they need him because all the first tier guys are involved in the war effort. A female reporter worms her way onto the crime scene and he decides to hire her because she's smart, puckish and not squeamish. He turns the investigation on its ears.

This is a fun time. It was produced in 2013 but has more the look and feel of a BBC TV series from much earlier. I generally liked the depiction of WWII London. the clothing, sets, and general stuff were all spot on. I was a bit dubious about his handling of the crime scenes though. I don't know much about criminal forensics of that period, but the way they've been depicted on American TV in the last decade suggests he was ahead of his time. He repeatedly makes the detectives on the case look like idiots.

Patrick Kennedy as pathologist Lennox Collins is an interesting sort. He's bookish, doesn't pay much attention to his wardrobe and likes listening to radio shows. Tamzin Merchant, as his sidekick Molly Cooper is a hoot. She pretty much does as he tells her unless she sees where she might help things along in which case she's in head first. All the other actors do a stand up job.

The investigation proceeds in an orderly fashion with the usual suspects and red herrings. I must admit I was surprised by how things turned out. It was an interesting twist on things.

This might not be the best mystery thriller you'll ever see but it's a worthwhile romp. Enjoy.",1415232000,,1864,4.486725663716814

6208811,4,B00HUAGYF8,"1940's, I was not sure that anyone paid any attention to the show of clues in a murder/crime scene. However, I was not alone. Along comes a new, young pathologist who turns this London pathology lab upside down.

Patrick Kennedy plays Dr Lennox Collins, newly arrived at the pathologist's office. His boss has the old  mannerisms and wants his lab run in the old fashioned way. Dr. Collins is not given many murder investigations until one night a young woman is found murdered. Collins insists on keeping the crime scene free of anything other than the clues inside. This is new to the detectives, but as he explains they go along with him. In this case he finds a Swatstika cut into the victims tongue. A total of 4 women's bodies are found, and Collins intends to find the murderer. Along the way he finds a news woman, Molly Cooper, played by Tamzin Merchant, interested in working for him as a secretary, and off they go.

The detectives and Collin's boss find a young German man they say is the murderer. Collins knows it is not him, and his job is to prove them wrong. This is a fun film, as well as gory with all the dismembered body parts all over the morgue. Molly Cooper lightens up the mood, and she is articulate and smart. Collins and Cooper prove to be a duo not to be warned off. I understand there is a Part Two, and I look forward to this film.

The medical examiners were not quite the troglodytes that were portrayed by the senior examiner who went by his instincts. Forensic medicine was used extensively in the 1880's in the Jack the Ripper search. Still, it's an interesting movie and very well performed.",1412812800,,518,5.407407407407407

6208829,4,B00HUAGYF8,"I'm a huge fan of British crime drama. I liked this one very much and recommend it for all the reasons other reviews have gone positive about it.

I'm not the least bit activist or have a pro-feminine agenda, in fact I detest all that sort of controversy and divisiveness. I wish nevertheless to point out that the male lead's name, Patrick Kennedy, is listed first (and often alone such as evidenced above and to the left as I write this review) and the cover image places him front and center while the drama opens from and is really told more from the shoes of the female lead, Tamzin Merchant.

I find that rather silly if not incredible. I wonder what those responsible for this are afraid of since Ms. Tamzin carries this drama with more than good aplomb.",1408492800,,761,4.467625899280575

6208836,5,B00HUAGYF8,The mystery is set during World War II in London.  The period piece is excellent with the background props.  And the story line sings.  I enjoyed the chemistry between the two leads.  Recommend.,1400889600,,194,4.787878787878788

8635856,5,B00HUAGYF8,"An excellent, not-too-dark serial killer mystery from wartime London.  The acting is good, and it reminds us of what London went through during the Blitz.  There are moments of humor, and for a murder mystery, this is oddly refreshing!  Highly recommended.",1489708800,,256,5.195121951219512

8635860,5,B00HUAGYF8,I saw this on pbs. I enjoyed it immensely. It is well written and acted. I also like period pieces. Probably because I am a baby boomer. I have a feeling american writers need to take a lesson from our british friends in writing a mystery. I also feel there are more choices of good mysteries offered on bbc and pbs. They are more involving. The characters are better defined.,1471737600,,376,4.385714285714286
8635861,5,B00HUAGYF8,"PLOT: serial killer uses the London Blitz to help cover his crimes.

LONDON WW2~ Dr. Lennox Collins~(Patrick Kennedy) a pathologist is called to the scene of several ""strangulations"" and ADDS up ""serial killer""....Dr. Lennox is very focused on his job which is a morgue lab. There is a good bit of ""dark humor"" which adds to the fun. Molly Cooper (Tanzin Merchant) is the overly eager ""mystery writer"" who shows up at a crime scene to get a ""scoop"" for her newspaper job. Dr. Lennox~ gives her a few clues but hires her for his assistant/secretary because she is not deterred by the gore in the ""lab"".....one of the big clues is a M ""stamp"" from a Dance Club on their left hand of the strangled victims.... Dr. Lennox and Molly compile a list of ""suspects"" which include a simpleton who collects ""sexy photos"" some of which are discovered at the crime scenes, the overly slick owner of the club and a polish man who loves the ladies. Before DNA the 'simple clues' add up to a help find a elusive strangler. ADDED fun is the doctor who is grossed out by the ""tongue sandwich"" Molly offers him for lunch ~ I give this one a 5 STARS~ all the way for likeable Forensic Fun and clever Doctor and Molly who solve the crimes. Also the better than most cinematography is a visual ""delight"" to watch.",1469145600,,1291,4.470338983050848
