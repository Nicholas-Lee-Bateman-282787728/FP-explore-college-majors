7927080,5,B00004Y7J9,"This is a quaint story about a scientist, a socialite, and several actors who enter a large metal ball that transports them to the past in merry olde England where they befriend William Shakespear and the socialite tells him how to complete a story he was writing. They show Queen Elizabeth picture postcards of America, which surprises her to see the Empire State Building and other sights in Manhattan (New York City), they run afoul of the authorities when one of the characters offers a pipe full of tobacco to Walter Raleigh before he discovers tobacco in the Virginia colony later; they are jailed where they manage to show a motion picture camera's image on the walls and confuse their captors, those effecting their escape and going back into the time travel machine to the future, 1944. It is an entertaining comedy during a time, World War Two, when America needed a diversion from the war, this light comedy provides that escape. Unfortunately you no longer see old films like this on television late at night, what a pity we no longer can stay up late to see such films and Johnny Carson!",1057363200,5,1100,4.704663212435233
