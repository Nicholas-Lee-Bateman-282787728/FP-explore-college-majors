Say goodbye to sad vhs scans this is real deal!",1468540800,,66,3.4
2510853,4,B000E9C0X2,"Ultra man & Spectra Man may have been staples of the UHF ""boob tube"" after school years.  However, Infra Man crossed the  HK ""Hollywood"" screen and graced audiences with the swooping larger than life place in celluloid history befitting ""Gojira"" meets Kung Fu theatre that it was... kick back, filter off, and blast off!",1462924800,2,320,4.907407407407407
2510854,5,B000E9C0X2,I purchased this because this was the first I ever saw in the movie theater. Sentimental purchase for me.,1448496000,,105,4.578947368421052

2510856,5,B000E9C0X2,this movie is the most awesome it has everything you like about the old cheesey monster movies and then some,1432857600,,108,4.45
2510857,4,B000E9C0X2,"At last! I've searched for this flick for the past 28 years and finally found a copy at the Orlando MegaCon. The main reason I hadn't had any luck is due to the fact I was thinking for the longest time that I was looking for an Ultraman movie from 1975. There was no such thing. As soon as I saw Inframan on the cover, I remembered...that was it! Anyway, if you're into Godzilla or kaiju in general you must check this out. (I also thought it was japanese...my mistake again!) Lots of crazy kung fu action and monsters. Great fun!",1140998400,7,530,4.257425742574258
2510858,1,B000E9C0X2,"This is a bad movie lovers delight. the plot, story, acting, directing, special effects and sound effects are so bad they make a Godzilla movie from the 60's look like an academy award winner. Absolutely piss poor movie. But if you love Godzilla movies the monsters in this disaster are perfect. Head slapping mind boggling stupidity. Enjoy.",1485648000,,341,5.0
2510859,5,B000E9C0X2,Great!,1484524800,,6,6.0
2510860,2,B000E9C0X2,It reminded me of....Nothing.  Didn't hold my interest for long.  I'm usually into the Monster movies but this was really not very inventive.,1484524800,,141,5.086956521739131
2510861,5,B000E9C0X2,Seen this at the theaters as a kid.  One of the most bizarre and entertaining films I've ever seen!,1484092800,,99,4.2105263157894735

2510865,2,B000E9C0X2,"While the monsters were weird and wacky, Inframan looked like a giant ant and had far too much trouble defeating not only the monsters, but their never ending hoards of underlings as well.  The hand to hand kung fu fights lasted FOREVER and were so mind numbingly repetitious, I was sorry I rented it.  As a lifelong fan of Japanese monster movies, I found this one to be a real disappointment; what a drag as the script had such potential.",1478908800,,440,4.4875

8107715,5,B000E9C0X2,"THE SUPER INFRAMAN (aka: INFRA-MAN- 1975) stars Danny Lee (THE MIGHTY PEKING MAN) as the titular hero. The mega-action starts right away, as humongous, flying monsters attack, destroying an entire cardboard city! Fires! Earthquakes! Volcanoes! This can mean only one thing! Dear Lord above! The Demon Princess Elizebub (Terry Liu) is taking over our beloved planet! Oh! Will no one arise to save us? Yes! Rayma (Lee) has volunteered for the job, allowing his body to undergo severe, drastic alterations, in order to become... SUPER INFRAMAN! Meanwhile, in the bowels of the Earth, Elizebub prepares her mutant army for conquest! These hellish horrors cause enough damage in human-sized form! Taking on gargantuan proportions, they assault the science center! Where's INFRAMAN, already? Many deaths are caused by swinging, green tentacles of doom! Then, at last, INFRAMAN is here! It's difficult to describe the splendor of a spider mutant vs. INFRAMAN battle, complete w/ motorcycles, helmeted skeleton men, kung fu, and that hideous laughter! Finally, INFRAMAN grows enormous to take down the diabolical behemoth! The Professor (Hsieh Wang), the creator of INFRAMAN, has invented the thunderbolt fists for his creation! They are the ultimate weapon! Now, the final battle commences. Another masterwork from the Shaw Brothers! Again, you'll either love this, or demand that all memory of it be destroyed!...",1513036800,3,1407,5.458715596330276
