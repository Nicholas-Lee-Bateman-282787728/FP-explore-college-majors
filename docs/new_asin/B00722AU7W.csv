I think it involves someone trying to drive a rich man crazy.  He doesn't help his situation by boozing it up.  Strange happenings occur and he has wild dreams.  His secretary even has what appears to be a cloven hoof instead of a normal foot.  Everyone speaks to him with loaded questions, smirks, and raised eyebrows.  If I were him I would tell all these creeps to hit the trail.  The film seems to have good production values and the picture and color are beautiful.  I would love to see this film released to DVD as soon as possible.",1385251200,,715,4.160583941605839
