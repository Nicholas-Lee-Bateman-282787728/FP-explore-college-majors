2567844,5,B000FIHN6G,My 3 1/2 yr old just loves Little Bear and as a mother I do too.  Little Bear is one of the few cartoons for children that I do NOT have to screen first.  There is nothing in the content that I find objectionable.,1194912000,,213,3.8181818181818183
2567845,5,B000FIHN6G,"My four year old daughter loves Little Bear.  The beauty in these dvds is that the stories are just around 10 minutes, and they play one after another. This keeps her entertained for quite a while.  They are wholesome and fun.",1194134400,,226,4.487804878048781
2567846,4,B000FIHN6G,"If you are looking for good cartoons for very young children to watch, the ""Little Bear"" series is an excellent choice. These videos are nonviolent, reasonably engaging and intelligent, and they generally teach good values and problem solving. It's not great art, but it is entertaining and won't insult your child's intelligence. Based on a series of books written by Else Homelund Minarik in the 1960s, this is good family fare -- you can park your kid in front of these films and not have to worry about disturbing or inappropriate content. Whew! Thank goodness. The episodes are short and each disc has quite a lot of content on them... a lot of bang for your buck. These have been big hits around our household.

2567848,5,B000FIHN6G,"We owned this on VHS when our older kids were younger, and just purchased it for our 2 1/2 year old twins.  Much better quality on DVD - we played the VHS version so much that it finally frayed.

A lot of episodes - and our 1st grade daughter still likes to watch it. Reminds me of a more innocent time - and encourages my kids to play outdoors and use their imaginations!  Now if only anyone can tell me where I can find a wolf suit like Max wears in Where the Wild Things Are (it shows up in one of the episodes on this DVD too)!",1174953600,,531,3.8981481481481484
2567849,4,B000FIHN6G,"""Little Bear: Halloween Stories"" is the only ""Little Bear"" DVD release for 2006. Although it's not immediately evident, this DVD is actually just a rerelease with additional stories of content already released on VHS. The main four featured stories that are part of the Halloween theme were all released on the VHS ""Little Goblin Bear"" (which I own) way back in 1999.

That said, this is still a great show. There's actually lot of content on this DVD --- around 75 minutes worth. In a smart move, each individual story is accessible from the main menu and the full opening and closing plays for each story --- so you / your kids have the choice of whether to watch it or fast-forward through it. Unfortunately, other than promos for other Nick Jr. releases, there are no special features.

Besides the Halloween-themed stories (which are ""Goblin Night,"" ""Moonlight Serenade,"" ""How to Scare Ghosts"" and ""Thunder Monster""), there are also eight other stories. I'm pretty sure most of these have been released before, but there may be one or two that haven't previously been seen on home video. ""Exploring"" is a very early and nice ""Little Bear"" story in which Little Bear heads up an expedition. Two other particularly noteworth ones are ""The Campfire Tale"" (in which Little's Bear's Uncle Rusty tells a story) and ""Duck Loses Her Quack"" (in which Duck tries to teach ducklings quacking.) The other stories are ""Under the Covers,"" ""Night of the Full Moon,"" ""Up All Night,"" ""Little Sherlock Bear"" and ""Detective Little Bear.""

One bit of warning --- the stories on this are so wonderfully relaxing that you or your kids might end up falling asleep! Not because it's boring --- it's anything but, but just because the overall tone, coloring and characters are very pleasant and relaxing. The only other show like this that I think offers real competition in this category is ""Maisy.""

Oh, and I didn't notice any changes in the theme music.",1162252800,52,1937,4.86060606060606
2567850,4,B000FIHN6G,"I love Little Bear for my 3 year old.  It DOES calm down little boys.  But I was disappointed that they changed the theme music.  Don't ""they"" realize that children need routine - my little boy jumps for joy when he hears the old theme music.  We put this on today all excited to see the Halloween episodes and he was quite upset the music was different - en fin....it is still Little Bear but just a little different.",1161216000,8,418,4.253164556962025

The feel of this particular one is autumnal , of course, and it has been watched so many times that I just had to buy it. The voice actors are very good as well, and the plots are simple and as lovely as the original books.

It's a cartoon that I enjoy watching with kids, and it is a safe one as well. The way carottons should be for little ones : violence-free, happy, pure, and creative. Simply lovely.",1420329600,,541,4.201923076923077

2567878,5,B000FIHN6G,"I loved little bear from the first time that I saw it on television. It teaches good, wholesome, family values and doesn't preach about world problems. It takes children back to a simpler time - before they were bombarded with technology and politics. Little Bear promotes pro-social behavior, imagination, creativity, and may even help a child advance their aesthetic sense. The music is soft and soothing, story lines are fun and youthful, and the general feel of this particular DVD has captured all of the warm and spicy spookiness of autumn. When I have time to myself and feel like watching something that captures the essence of childhood innocence, I will definitely pick Little Bear off of my shelf (Which currently holds the complete collection of Beatrix Potter). I don't see how this DVD could be found scary to any child, or how any adult could possibly call this rubbish. It's certainly better than the mainstream ""educational"" kid shows that are currently on the market, and I won't hesitate to grab up as many of these episodes as I can.",1398556800,4,1053,4.855555555555555

2567885,5,B000FIHN6G,"When looking for halloween content for little kids (my daughter just turned 3) it can be a shakey road. You don't want to scare them but you want a wee bit of halloween atmosphere. Little bear delivers this perfectly .

The first 'episode' is the closest to halloween, it's goblin night and the characters dress up. My daughter finds this episode a wee bit scary but she still asks to watch it, she just wants me with her . Little bear is charming, another reviewer mentioned it is so low key and relaxing that it can put kids to sleep and that's the absolute truth. The other episodes deal with scarecrows, harvest moons, monster stories and thunder. There is one where the pie disappears and they go on a hunt to find out who stole it.

I just love that little bear has such a great message and delivered so calm. If I had to change one thing it would be that the ending credits don't play after every episode after I click play all. I don't mind the theme song playing. I didn't dock stars for that ofcourse because it is just a pet peeve.",1382054400,2,1042,4.311224489795919

The few first ones are halloween but many of them are for all year long to enjoy. The movie lasts over an hour so you don't have to keep changing the movie as some childrens dvd movies are only 30-45 minutes long. My children have LOVED little bear for all of the years I have taught. The life lessons he teaches are ones every parent is proud for their children to learn. Being kind, sharing, a good family base, don't be afraid of storms, ect. Buy this one and you will never regreat it!!!",1354838400,,755,4.178082191780822

2567897,5,B000FIHN6G,"Little Bear is one of those things from your childhood you just can't leave behind. I grew up watching the cartoon apart of Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. programming block in the 90s. And as I matured into an adult, Little Bear is one of the things I just couldn't ever give up. This DVD is great and provides almost 2 hours worth of Little Bear.

There are four main episodes that make up the ""Halloween stories"", which are:

""Goblin Night"" - Little Bear and Cat set out on Goblin Night together. Along the way they meet up with friends while trying to avoid the goblins believed to be awake on this night.

""Moonlight Serenade"" - A magical Autumn episode featuring Little Bear, enchanted gardening equipment, lively pumpkins, and a walking scarecrow. This episode features beautiful scenery, from a spooky cat and owl (not the characters) in a rather scary tree, to a bright harvest moon in the sky.

""How to Scare Ghosts"" - Little Bear is awoken in the middle of the night to some rather musical ""ghosts"" in the living room. By playing Father Bear's trumpet, Little Bear joins in. Love the music in this episode!

""Thunder Monster"" - A stormy night keeps Little Bear awake, and provokes him to anger. He tries his best to scare off the titular monster.

Besides the four main episodes, there are seven other episodes too!

""Exploring"" - Little Bear, Cat, and Duck set out on an exploration to find Mother Bear and Father Bear's special spot, a tree atop of a rock.
""Duck Looses Her Quack"" - While babysitting, Duck must teach the ducklings how to quack. Unfortunately on this day she has lost her quack!
""Night Of The Full Moon"" - Little Bear and Father Bear stay up late reading a monster story by firefly light. On this night there's a full moon, and they both set out to scare the monsters of the night! I love the Maurice Sendak characters featured in the book!
""Little Sherlock Bear"" - Mother Bear has prepared a delicious pie for Father Bear. But the pie goes missing, and Little Bear interrogates his friends and uses clues to find the pie ""thief"".
""Under The Covers"" - Little Bear becomes frightened of bed bugs, which leads to late night fun with Mother Bear and Father Bear!
""The Campfire Tale"" - While camping with Little Bear and Father Bear, Uncle Rusty tells them the story of a certain little bear who tried to give his mother bear the moon as a gift.
""Up All Night"" - While Father Bear is away fishing at sea, Little Bear wants to stay up to watch the sunrise with Mother Bear.

Great collection of episodes, even if they don't all have a common theme.
The fact you can get 2 hours worth of Little Bear on one DVD for an affordable price is great! Perfect DVD for your own Goblin Night!",1349395200,9,2698,4.5030674846625764
