489558,4,6302658888,"This is a film for monster movie aficionados. This movie and the original ""Godzilla"" movie are without question the best of the Japanese sci-fi monster movies. For one thing, it's a serious film. Japanese sci-fi flicks eventually  took on a chuckle-headed quality, that diminished their stature. This film is  filled with vivid images and scenes. The color photography helps set the atmosphere  of fantastic events in exotic settings. A destroyed city burning by night in the  background, offset by 20th century neon signs still flashing in the foreground,  emphasizes nature's primitive force embodied in Rodan. Forget the endless series of  ""Godzilla vs. Somebody"" movies that would eventually follow, and go buy  this classic sci-fi/monster movie. It's easy to forget adulthood and pretend you're  a kid again, watching Saturday afternoon matinees at the local movie theatre back in  1958.",939686400,9,892,5.405797101449275

489681,5,6302658888,"Rodan was my father's favorite monster movie of all time. So it holds a special place in my heart. He was born in 1930 and was only 3 when the original King Kong aired in theaters. I was born in 1970, so 1977s King Kong climbing the World Trade Center was my monster movie.

Rodan is considered a CLASSIC in our home.  It deserves  its place in the very Top Tier of monster movies. For me it's: King Kong, Gamera, Godzilla then Rodan.  Top of the heap.

This movie seemed so short because it was so good.  A true shame that it didn't receive the same attention that Godzilla received.",1505347200,4,584,4.263636363636364

489688,4,6302658888,"I've always loved this little movie. It was a huge movie when I was a kid, and it scared me to death the first few times I saw it.  I remember when it came out in the movies, but I didn't get to see it until I was probably about 10 - 12 years old when they started showing it on tv. Of course, back in those days, just about all of the horror movies were shown on Creature Features and similar shows, but I believe this one was actually shown a lot on the regular weekend movie series that came on, back in the day.
I imagine some of the younger people may consider this movie to be rather cheesy, with bad special effects compared to what we have nowadays, but this movie was successful despite the bad dubbing, and the inconsistent scale of the creatures in it throughout the movie.  I wore out my old VHS of this long ago, and now I am happy to be able to just sit down with a bag of popcorn, and watch it over and over again.",1491696000,2,929,3.989247311827957

489762,5,6302658888,"Rodan was one of the great giant monster movies along with Godzilla, Gamera, Ghidorah, King Kong, etc.
The one thing I have to say about these types of movies is you have to look at them in a 'what if' mode.  No one tops the giant monster movies like the Japanese and Rodan stands out kind of like Mothra v. Godzilla.
The scenic backgrounds during the monster attacks were A-1 for thieir time.  Inishiro Honda did not leave a stone unturned in this movie.  Every angle you could think of, he incorporated it in this film.  This is one of the best monster movies around.  This is a must see.",1490227200,3,590,4.327272727272727

There was a lot more emotion in Rodan and the English dubbing (with someone with a Japanese accent) was careful and at time almost poetic. [I just learned it was a young GEORGE TAKEI, ""Sulu"" of Star Trek fame!]

Most of the middle of the film was pretty standard ""let's wreck Tokyo"" stuff, but what lead up to it...and the conclusion were much better quality than any sequels of ""(name the monster) meets (name the other monster).""

Also, for those who were not aware of all the above-ground nuclear ""testing,"" in the 50's, the actual footage of these bombs going off on land and over the ocean in the intro may be as horrific as Rodan was in the film.

Be ABSOLUTELY certain you watch the documentary afterwards.  It's about making miniatures & the behind the scenes extreme talent it took...I was stunned.

Actually kind of sad to think that Korty directed this film over 100 years ago, and the 1956 release was so well dubbed when compared to some of today's dubbing catastrophes. Proof that it takes more than just technology to do good work.

This one starts out a bit slow,  but the ending you'll  not forget.  The last Rodan  monster dies rather than abandon its mate.  In that sense this is an excellent and unforgettable love story.  The movie dates to the late 1950's or early 1960's.  I recommend it for a late night monster movie.  The movie becomes especially better after about one-third of the way through it.  Rodan appears in later Godzilla movies,  but I think his role in this movie is superior.

490128,5,6302658888,"I was just a kid when I first saw this movie. Perhaps back then I didn't
grasp what it was really about. Over the years, though, I've seenit a few
times more, and with each watching, I understand something about this film.

In the early 50's, science-fiction movies about giant monsters were abundant.
The Japanese contributions to this genre were prolific. Godzilla was the first,
and it stands today as one of the best of the forerunners of it's type. Yes,
you can knock it as phony, with special effects that pale by comparison to what
we see today. But they didn't have computer technology back then. They had to do
it with men in make-up, and toys filmed with cameras. And the Japanese didn't have
geniuses like Ray Harryhausen and his stop-motion photography. So they did their best.

The original Godzilla was magnificent. But RODAN out-did it, IMO. Rodan had a few
elements that took the whole Japanese Sci-Fi genre to a new level. I don't expect
you to grasp this the way I did, and do, but Rodan had something that nothing
before it, nor nothing since had. It was a love story. A love story between two
young Japanese betrothed, and a love story between their two antagonists.

You have to watch the whole movie to understand, and I don't want to give it all
away. But if you watch this movie to its very end, you might see and understand
what I'm saying.  In the end, it's all about sacrifice for one's true love.

The Rodan flying monsters aren't that scary, but the beasts at the befinning are.
Again, you have to see the movie to understand the relationship between the giant
cattepillers and the giant birds. As opposed to many giant monster movies, especially]
those from Japan, it actually takes a modicum of intelligence to enjoy this one.

I highly recommend it, and suggest you guy the DVD for yourself as opposed to buying
or renting the streaming version.",1374969600,,1877,4.604790419161676

RODAN.  I was about 13 and my brother 11 when we went to see Rodan on a Saturday and could stay in the theater as long as we wanted watching not only this movie but many others.  And I mean all day long and night too unless someone came to get us and said no you can't stay any longer.

I remember the tense feeling I got when Rodan would pass over something and that something evaporated!  WHooo!  Then, at the end, when the poor monsters fell into the burning volcano, both my brother and I cried.  Both  trying hard not to let the other see and of course not making a sound.  Just silent tears and thoughts.  We saw it many times, and on Saturdays, until the theater pulled it.  Those were good ol' days.  And a quarter to boot!

They're pterodactyl type beasts that destroy everything they fly over because of the intense wind beneath their wings.  This just may be what Bette Midler was singing about.
Naturally the military is organized and every bit of artillery in Japan is used on the creatures without making so much as a scratch.  The Rodans do come to a fiery end via Mother Nature.....or do they?  You know the answer to that, don't act like I gave anything away.

The Bad -- ""It's the atomic bomb's fault."" The scapegoat for all these early movies. That's just lazy writing.

The Rodan creatures are only seen in the last 30 minutes as they ravage Japan, which is par for these Kaiju movies. When they do show up, their mutual destruction scenes will blow you away, if you can get past . . .

The Ugly -- the tacky special effects. The models are obviously fake, adding a quaint charm, but there's nothing realistic here that grounds this movie into the real world.

490192,4,6302658888,"If you are a fan of Godzilla or Gamera or any ""kaiju""/giant monster movies, you have to add ""Rodan"" to your DVD collection. This is a fantastic little movie, with a pretty original story, and top notch special effects.

The basic premise of ""Rodan"" is that a mining operation in Japan busts through a wall flooding the lowest tunnels of the mine. Two men are sent in to investigate, one of them turns up horribly mutilated and it's presumed he was murdered by the  second man who has gone missing. More death and destruction follow, and it's learned that the culprit is actually a group of giant caterpillars. While trying to stop the caterpillar menace, a new force is unleased....two giant, prehistoric birds that destroys everything in their path.

For most of the film the Rodans are portrayed as little more than high flying vapor trails. The final half hour is wall-to-wall Rodan vs. Army mayhem and lots of fun, but that doesn't mean the first hour is lacking. The giant bugs, known here as Meganulon more than carry the film. There are some pretty suspense-filled scenes as miners walk in waist deep water searching for the hungry critters. I actually preferred the first half of this film before Rodan even makes an appearance.

This is a fun movie that seems to have been relatively forgotten. If you are only familiar with Rodan as a nemesis/ally to Godzilla, give the big bird a chance to win you over with his own story.",1268265600,,1433,4.674603174603175

First, some of the minors are suspected, but it soon becomes clear that the mine is infested with giant prehistoric bugs!  A team is sent in to battle the bugs, and one is killed by sending a mine car into it.  One of the team's members is lost.  He is found later in shock and stricken with amnesia.  Soon, his memory returns, just as unidentified flying objects begin wiping out jets and eating innocent people. According to the ex-amnesiac's memory, he witnessed an enormous bird hatch from a gargantuan egg!  Scientists quickly name the monster Rodan and identify it as a prehistoric Teranadon, somehow having survived many years of hibernation.  As the military prepares to destroy the creature and cities are evacuated, another Rodan appears!  The two giant birds wreak massive havoc with the wind created from the flapping of their wings and then disappear.  The military decides to bury them allive in a volcano.  The Rodans try to escape, but one is overcome by the flames and fumes.  While the other...I won't blow everything!

Rodan is basically a 50's B movie, not much more or less.  The major thing which sets this movie apart from other giant monaster movies is that it's monster returned numerous times (in the Godzilla series).

The script isn't the greatest, but it is fun at times, especially the long build up to the twin terrors' flight of doom late in the film.  Of course that is part of the problem as well.  The rodans have only one destructive run before being defeated by the military, moments later.

The characters are fun and interesting as is the film, but it just never rises very far above the other SciFi films of the day.  The special effects are fairly good and the fear can be felt early in the film with the mystery of the miner deaths, but the fear is gone as soon as the Rodans begin their rampage.

Something about this film makes it feel somewhat intelligent but it falls short of the mark.

I would like to give this film 2 1/2, but it probably deserves a 3, though just barely.  Unfortunately, Rodan would be reduced to a poorer character when he/she returned in the Godzilla series.",1109894400,2,2208,4.651162790697675

This Rodan DVD seems to be the norm for the majority of kaiju DVDs released here in the States; the movie is good, classic kaiju eiga, but this DVD is barebones, and rather lacking in quality.

Movie

Rodan is a classic Japanese monster film released shortly after Gojira 1954, and the first of the Toho films to be released in colour. Basically two giant flying monsters wreck havoc on Sasebo and other parts of Japan. SFX are kinda cheesy in some scenes, and the scene where a jet is destroyed midair is repeated way too many times, but other than that the Rodans look pretty good flying around and causing havoc. Wires are occasionally visible, something I've never really noticed when I saw this on TV. There are a few times where the SFX were so cheesy I laughed out loud, like when the bug lunges 100ft at a policeman and kills him. Hehe... Pretty consistent with Toho's efforts. Akira Ifukube is responsible for the music, and Ishiro Honda returns as director. I doubt this is the uncut version...

4/5

Video

The picture is average at best; of course, some of this is due to the film's age (1956), but the transfer really isn't that great, and there are scratches and print damage all over the place. Given the awesome treatment Toho has given for many of their Region-2 releases of older kaiju films, there really isn't much of an excuse for such shoddiness on the part of Classic Media/Sony. Rodan, like Gojira 1954, was filmed in Full Screen, so a lack of widescreen here isn't a concern.

2/5

Audio

Sadly this DVD only offers English Dubbing; the original Japanese track is nowhere to be found. The dubbing is adequate for the most part, although there are some awkward moments, and appears to the be same dubbing in the version frequently on TV. The 5.1 track is absolutely terrible, echoing like no other, and is quite a pain to listen to. Stick with the 2.0 Stereo here, which is adequate.

Extras

Other than an awful preview for the Godzilla game for Gamecube, there isn't anything else.

The quality is low enough where you should only pick this up if you find it for $5 or less in some bargain bin somewhere; the $10 they ask for here on Amazon may be too much.

490342,4,6302658888,"Following the success of the ""Godzilla"" monster movies, Toho Productions of Japan created another giant nuclear-age menace in the form of a giant pterodactyl known as ""Rodan"".  However, in this early color film from 1956, there wasn't just one Rodan terrorizing Japan, there were two!  Beginning in the quiet mining village of Kitamatsu on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, the miners who are digging very deeply inadvertently open a passage into a cavern where frightening giant insects dwell.  After several miners are mutilated, one of the giant insects enters the village and frightens mining engineer Shigeru Kawamura (Kenji Sahara) and his girlfriend Kiyo (Yumi Shirakawa).  Determined to stop the giant insects, Shigeru, Police Chief Nishimura (Akio Kobori) and several miners go down into the mine; but a cave-in traps Shigeru in the cavern.  When the nearby volcano suddenly becomes active, several giant sinkholes form around the mine.  Unsure if Shigeru is still alive, he is found wandering in one of the sinkholes but is suffering from amnesia.  While recovering from his ordeal, UFO's begin to terrorize the skies over Japan and several nearby countries.  Finally, Shigeru remembers having witnessed the hatching of a Rodan in the cavern; but when the military tries to take them out, they discover that there are two them!  Will Japan (and the rest of the world) be saved from these giant supersonic pterodactyls?  You'll just have to watch this fun Japanese monster movie to find out!

""Rodan"", a.k.a. ""Sora no daikaij Radon"" in transliterated Japanese, has been one of my favorite Japanese monster movies since I was young.  Though the color quality has aged and was not restored for the DVD, it is still a very entertaining film to watch.  Other memorable characters in ""Rodan"" include the honeymooners (Kiyoharu Onaka and Yasuko Nakata), Professor Kyuichiro Kashiwagi (Akihiko Hirata, 1927-1984) and Professor Isokawa (Mitsuo Matsumoto).  Overall, for being a wonderfully campy and very entertaining film, I rate ""Rodan"" with a resounding 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it any monster movie aficionado.",1104278400,18,2134,5.256637168141593
490343,5,6302658888,"""Rodan"" is frequently compared to studio-mate Godzilla in many ways. I think that ""Rodan"" is at least as well made and in some ways superior to any of the Godzilla films. For starters it is in color, which was a bit rare for a film made in 1956; furthermore, the color is vibrant and well preserved in this modern print. The acting is better than most of the Toho films, as is the script. The biggest difference is the sets, with the ""Rodan"" sets far and away more realistic looking than the Godzilla counterparts. The blending of real shots and miniatures is far above average for a film of this age as well. The 'bridge' set featured near the end of the film is probably the best miniature set in the history of Toho productions.
Rodan is a message movie, and, of course, cautions us about the use of nuclear weapons. The use of these weapons causes first the release of some just plain wacky looking caterpillar monsters, followed by two Rodans. The Rodans terrorize Japan until eventually they are engulfed by a man made volcanic eruption, in one of the best endings in any of the films of this genre.
Of all the Toho monster films, I think that ""Rodan"" is my favorite. Buy it today and see what monster movies are supposed to look like!",1088380800,40,1241,4.47136563876652
490344,4,6302658888,"Now, This flm, Rodan was the first movie to consist of the famous Rodan monster. and was also the first Toho Kaiju (Giant Monster) film to feature Color Video.
Rodan all begins when several miners are found dead, and then suddenly GIANT FREAKY monsters appear in the town, this all leads up to the hatching of Rodan, the giant prehistoric flying dinosaur, that is so big, when it flaps its wings it is propeled forward so fast it creates a sonic boom.
The film itself features a lot of human dialog, and there are not many Monster VS Monster battles, but we do get to see some interesting destruction scenes.
Without spoling anyone I would say that the ending was sort of cheap.
Overall would I sugguest Rodan to people? Yes, but not as much casual fans as fans deeper into the Giant Monster stuff. But if you like classics, and think you would like like a Giant Prehistoric bird flying around killing planes and sonic booming cities, then you probably will like this film",1084320000,4,972,4.56

490346,4,6302658888,There are two Rodans terrorizing tokyo. There jet fast flying ability and there hurricane effect really level tokyo. Its a good flick And i know the spx was not all that and the spx were quite lame but its RODAN.The storyline was pretty good and the action was done very nice. Ther reason I didn't rate it a 5 because it was missing something to it. Somehow The original godzilla had something to it then this. But overal you need to get this its a good kajiu film.,1079827200,,465,4.295454545454546
490347,4,6302658888,"This is a pretty solid movie from the late 50's produced by the king of monster-making, Toho Co.
In fact, this movie would've been perfect, but the monster scenes seemed to be lacking the kind of charisma that Godzilla brought to the screen.  As for the human scenes, they're perfect.  By perfect, I mean they're entertaining in a very campy way.  In fact, it was actually the human scenes that carried this movie through with its camp-soaked dialogue.  I'll provide some examples:
Ex. 1) Towards the beginning of the movie, members of the mining team have sent out a search party to the deepest tunnel they had.  As they're walking through, one of the men begins to talk:
""Smells down here.  Kind of sour and warm.  I don't like it!!!""
Ex. 2) After one of the bodies had been found floating in the water, the narrator chimes in with this eulogy:
""Yoshi was dead when they carried him from the mine.  But he didn't die from drowning...he had been killed.  More than killed - he had been slaughtered like an animal!!!""
Ex. 3) At the conclusion of the movie when the two Rodan get covered in lava, and burn to death, the narrator begins talking again:
""I wonder if I, a 20th Century man, could ever hope to die as well.""
LOL
In any case, there are also some funny situations:
Situation 1) Some military men spot a giant caterpillar on a nearby hill, and immediately open fire on it with their pistols.  The caterpillar then kills two soldiers and tosses them down the hill where an entourage of people are standing around.  A doctor, who had seen everything, shoves everyone out of the way, kneels down to both soldiers, examines their wounds and proclaims to everybody that ""all the wounds were done by that monster!""  (nah!!!  I'm sure they had no clue!)
Situation 2) A search party is investigating one of the underground mining tunnels.  As they're wading through the water, one of the men starts crying for help as he gets pulled down under the water.  A man standing nearby immediately fires his pistol into the water where the first guy was previously standing.  (I guess gun safety wasn't fashionable in the 50's)
In any case, the human scenes were very entertaining.  I never once got bored by any of it.
As for the monster scenes, they were solid.  But that's it.  It was missing something special.  I think a monster vs. monster scene was needed, but that's just my opinion.  I guess I just never got pulled into Rodan's charm whereas Godzilla is freaking awesome (overall).  Don't get me wrong, though...Rodan is pretty tough.  He flies at supersonic speed.  And the wind generated by such speed causes cars to fly through the air, and trees to get ripped out of their foundations.  But still, he was missing that something special.
Overall, it's a solid monster movie.  And for $5.99, you'd be silly not to check this out.",1077321600,,2833,4.616
490348,1,6302658888,"I bought this DVD at [store] for [price].  I can safely say that it was probably worth half of that.  I think that I seem to be missing all of this mystery that everyone else speaks of when they describe roDAN!  I know that special effects were not in their prime back in roDAN!'s days, but seeing the same tank roll by in a scene three times isn't doing it for me.  Also, the exact same jet airplane was destroyed at least four times.  I don't know much about Japanese cinema, but their dialogue proves to be uninteresting and ponderous. The only thing that kept myself and my friends going during the movie was shouting roDAN!  The monsters were overly plastic and the model towns were obvious.  If we are going to be that fake, I would at least want a little camp.  In mechagodzilla it was funny to see this beast fly by essentially standing horizontally and moving across the screen. Here roDAN! is taken too seriously.  I say we need less boring dialogue that doesn't contribute to the plot and more action for roDAN!",1071964800,,1022,4.451612903225806
490349,4,6302658888,"Rodan has always been a misunderstood monster, who suffers in comparison to Godzilla, Mothra, and Gidorah. After all, Rodan doesn't really have any powers per se, such as Godzilla's radioactive fire breath. Rodan's chief weapons (other than sheer size), are flapping his wings to cause powerful gusts of wind, and flying around at supersonic speeds. As a result, Rodan comes off as a weak sister compared to the other monsters. At least Mothra can spray silk at his enemies!
I did note that, in the close-ups, it looked as if Rodan had some sort of gas spray coming from his mouth, which may have been an element abandonded by the director, or simply cut from the US release. This really is a shame, because the lack of monster power has doomed Rodan to cameos and second stringer status in the Toho monster line-up.
In any event, I like the fact that Rodan is played as a villain here, albeit a half-hearted one. The later Godzillas are fun, but to be honest, they got campier and campier as the series progressed. Here we have a big old monster wreckin' stuff just because, and teaching Mankind not to mess with Mother Nature.
The effects range from good to fair. There are numerous shadows from the miniature Rodans that appear on the backdrop used for the ""sky"", as well as obvious wires to help flap the wings of the Rodan creatures.
Then there's the inexplicable scene where a Rodan just stands around and squawks while the Army blasts away at it with tank fire. Other than that, the mystery behind the emergence of the flying monsters was very well handled, beginning with the strange deaths in the coal mine, and the appearance of the giant killer incects. The thoughtful voiceover throughout and at the end helps to tie up any loose threads, especially for those of us in the American audience who may not be clear on the finer points of Japanese culture or philosophy.
It really is too bad that the unedited Japanese version of ""Rodan"" is not currently available. And wouldn't it be nice to see a new, modern Rodan feature, like the 1990s Godzillas? Sadly, this seems very unlikely. Rodan fans will have to wander over to the Gamera camp and check out the first installment in the newer Gamera movies (""Guardian of the Universe""), in which a sinister Rodan-like monster fights the big turtle and wrecks Tokyo.",1058486400,3,2319,4.686274509803922
490350,5,6302658888,"More so than later Toho offerings, Rodan is darker, creepier and takes itself more seriously.  This is also the only one of their pantheon that gave me bad dreams as a kid after watching.  The claustrophobic terror in the partially flooded deep mine 8 is menacing.  The death of the miners at the hands of the caterpillars was then and now equally disturbing, mixing the chatter of the creatures and the cries of pain and terror.  Twin Rodans are discovered once the final underground barrier is broken through, they dine on the caterpillars and soon begin hunting for human flesh.  Another dark moment occurs when the two school age lovers are swept up and killed [eaten?].  Despite the wires I always enjoyed when Rodan lands on the building in slow mo during the city destruction scene, seems nicely choreographed.  I do find the explosion scene a bit too long in the end, needs some editing down before the volcano kicks in.  In all though, a great, nostalgic look back when Toho was still trying to push the morality button about what kind of backlash is unleashed by man's tinkering w/ nature.  Recommended.",1057104000,3,1113,4.755208333333333
490398,3,6302658888,"The DVD is nice for the price.  But, I wish, with this and other Toho films, that we had the original full-length Japanese release with subtitles.  I think the original Japanese versions of Godzilla, Rodan, Monster Zero and Mothra would be big sellers. Certainly, Japanese language Godzilla VCDs are sell well on Ebay.
Some other Ishiro Honda classics, like the Mysterians and Battle in Outer Space would also do well.  The bootleg copies are always selling out on Ebay.
I like Rodan.  I think the storyline has merit.  Its a good ""popcorn"" film.  Rodan appears to be the first Japanese ""big"" monster movie to carry a sympathetic theme toward the monster.
This CD is worth the price of purchase.  It is the best Rodan available.",1051488000,4,728,4.776
490399,3,6302658888,"I love Japanese monster movies, and I've always been quite fond of Rodan, but this film actually leaves me rather nonplussed.  Naturally, it's the testing of atomic weapons that is to blame for the unleashing of Rodan upon Southeast Asia.  Whereas radiation basically helped create Godzilla, in the case of Rodan it merely creates the circumstances wherein large prehistoric eggs deep underground are given the right environment in which to hatch.  All of this happens deep in a coal mine, where several men are mysteriously mauled by giant insects.  When both Rodans hatch (yes, there are actually two Rodans, apparently mates), they do the humans a big favor by eating the killer insects, yet the humans still seem determined to kill them.  Here's my real problem with this movie: the Rodans don't really do much of anything.  Sure, they destroy a few cities here and there, but their heart really doesn't seem to be in the job.  Rodan's one and only weapon is his set of wings, which are capable of generating hurricane force winds.  It's fun to watch buses and houses blown across the landscape, but one soon yearns for a good fight, the type of fight the army is incapable of giving the giant flying reptiles.  The special effects are fairly good overall, but on a few occasions (such as the shots of jets unleashing their missiles) they are clearly seen to feature models of a somewhat unimpressive variety.  The ending is actually rather boring in a way, as the fighting is essentially of an indirect variety.  At just 72 minutes long, Rodan just doesn't offer the types of thrills that most Godzilla movies present, and its only remarkable element in my mind is the poignant and downright sad meditations offered on the heels of the final conflict.",1050710400,,1756,4.82
490400,3,6302658888,"For the first time in the US, Rodan has hit the DVD market!  Presented in full frame (that is how it was filmed, contrary to what some may say) with it's original mono & a really bad 5.1 mix soundtrack (i'd stick with the mono as the 5.1 has an echo-y type of noise to it).  If you like monster movies, this will not disappoint.  The dvd doesn't have any special features, just a commercial for the Godzilla Gamecube video game.  The video quality is not the greatest as I'd rate it a C.  But for $..., it's not too shabby.  If you have never seen Rodan, pick this up as it may be the only time this movie gets released on Region 1 DVD.",1048809600,,636,4.048
490401,2,6302658888,"Rodan remains one of the most entertaining of all Japanese monster movies, with nice color photography and more consistent special effects than the original Godzilla. This DVD, though, is a disappointment. The print that was used is by no means the cleanest you'll ever find--lots of scratches and dirt on the image--and there really aren't any extras. No effort appears to have been made to find better source material, and that makes for a less-than-stellar DVD experience. They could have done much better.",1046995200,,509,5.144578313253012

Would this be the one to finally feature an option to watch the movie in Japanese with English subtitles? Evidently not. I'm tired of these great movies being reduced to cheap B flicks by virtue of awful dubbing, re-editing and the deletion of music cues. It's time they were seen as originally intended.  I've been lucky enough to see subtitled copies of many of the Godzilla movies... all of them brilliant.
But these tacky dubbed versions drain all the soul out of them... and are an insult to the great filmmaker's who put them together in the first place. I'm tempted to learn Japanese and buy the official Toho releases.",1033430400,2,743,4.628787878787879

It was also one of the monster movies of all time to be in full color. The effects surpass Godzilla in a way. The film had a better story than Godzilla. I also reccomend Godzilla to be bought.

490406,4,6302658888,"When audiences watch RODAN, they tend to view the movie as a companion piece to GODZILLA.  In both films, Tokyo is squashed flat by outsized dinosaurs.  True, both do that, but they differ in one critical respect.  In GODZILLA, the monster makes its appearance fairly early on, so that the audience is carried along to view the destruction with the creature as the dramatic center.  In contrast, the first half of RODAN, presents much smaller monsters--huge 'insects'--that Rodan will later eat.  These insects are presented as living in a series of dark and damp watery tunnels that call to mind the claustrophobia that Ridley Scott would later employ in ALIEN. Several innocent miners and police officers are killed and devoured.  The hero saves himself only to face one of the truly scariest of images in all of the horror genre, the gigantic egg from which a fully developed Rodan will emerge.  The shock on his face nearly drives him insane.  The shock within me was not much less.  The destruction of Rodan and his mate are nearly anti-climactic, and fill the audience with a strange sense of loss that these flying creatures, despite their lethality, yet possessed their own innate sense of life and beauty.  If nothing else, RODAN forces the audience to question the killing of animals only for following their natural instincts. Thus, RODAN is one of a rare breed of monster movies; it causes you to ponder the movie long after the monsters have bitten the dust.",1023148800,4,1471,4.848

Japanese Monster Movies Rule! P.S. Obviously, they  had time to reproduce because later on in Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla II ,  another Rodan is discovered.
