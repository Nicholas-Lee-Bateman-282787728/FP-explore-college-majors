1. Kurt Angle and Sting vs. Team Pacman for the TNA World Tag Team Titles- This was not the choice I would want to star t the show but I understood why they did it because Kurt has 2 more matches to wrestle that night. This was more of a segment match than a wrestling match. Angle and Sting dominate the whole thing until Angle turns on sting which leads to pacman pinning sting to win the tag team titles. Winners and new TNA Tag Team Champs Team Pacman. Match Rating 2/10.
2. Rhino vs. James Storm with Mrs. Jackie- Wow after two not so good ppv matches this one was a great one. It seemed like both men came out with a lot of energy. This match was not that different than there first match at victory road as there was a lot of outside action. When these two got back in the ring the action picked up and the back and forth near falls are what really made this match good. Good effort by both men. Winner Rhino. Match Rating 8/10.
3. Kaz vs. Robert Roode with Mrs. Brooks- This was a decent match. It was one of those average matches that Roode usually puts on. Nothing great here but they are starting to build Kaz as he looked great here but the veteran roode helped him along. Not a lot to say about this match but just solid wrestling. Winner Kaz. Match Rating 7/10.
4. Kurt Angle vs. Black Machismo Jay Lethal for the TNA X-Division Title- This was one match that I really enjoyed to watch on this card. It had the perfect storyline as no one thought that lethal would beat Kurt Angle. This match reminded me of Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle at summerslam 2002. Anyway this was good with Lethals speed and angles technical wrestling skills they mixed well. Very good match and a huge upset by lethal. Winner and new TNA X-Division Champ Black Machismo Jay Lethal. Match Rating 8.5/10.
5. Black Regin vs. Chris Harris in a no DQ match- Wow was this match bad. It was so funny how Harris was getting a good push just a couple of months ago and now he is stuck wrestling with black Reign. I don't know why tna keeps bringing black regin back as he can't wrestle and brings negativity to the locker room. A match that you can skip. Winner Chris Harris. Match Rating 3/10.
6. 10 Men Gaunlet Match for a shot at the TNA World Tag Team Titles- I think this was a very good match. What a way to kick off the match with to of the most gifted athletes in tna aj styles and Christopher denials. The match is different but for the type of match it flowed really well. Lots of fast pace action and to be honest this was a match that was very unpredictable. It came down to the motor city machine guns and aj and tomko which had near fall after near fall. Very good stuff. Winners Aj Styles and Tomko. Match Rating 7.5/10.
7. Christian Cage vs. Samoa Joe- I never got to see there match at destination x and let me tell you from watching this match it was quite clear that these two can put on a hell of a match any time you want. Both men can do it in a hardcore enviroment and a wrestling one as well. This feud had just started to grow and it helped hype up the match before it started. There was just a lot of back and forth action and wondering if joe was going to hand Christian his first pin or subbmisiion in tna. The match ended in a dq which sucked but I will say that this was one time were I did not mind the dq because it led to the final encounter at bound for glory. Winner by DQ Samoa Joe. Match Rating 8.5/10.
8. Kurt Angle vs. Abyss for the TNA World Heavyweight Title- This was angles third match of the night and I was surprised that he still went out there and put on a good 16 minute main event. These two have had battles in the past and they have been good. Most of the match was controlled by angle but Abyss fought back into it. There were some near falls but what surprised me the most was Abyss did not have to use any weapons In this match to put on a good one. Good main event. Winner and still TNA Heavyweight Champ Kurt Angle. Match Rating 8/10.

Well that raps up another I would give TNA No Surrender a grade of 52.5/80 which is a 66% which means this is a good ppv. That rating is a little misleading because there are only two bad matches on the whole card and they are total about 10 minutes. You should definitely pick this dvd up you will enjoy it. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1206316800,,4446,4.174621653084983
8218740,2,B000VI6OO2,"This TNA PPV had announcements & revelations that would help improve the future of TNA, shock the wrestling world, and gave us the match TNA fans voted as their match of the year. However this wasn't the show TNA needed to give their fans before Bound For Glory as there were only 3 matches that stood out while the others were just average to down right stupid & pathetic.

Preshow: Robert Roode vs. Von Doring - This match was the debut of Robert Roode's new ""JBL/Ted Dibiase"" character however it came across flat. Instead of this being a squash match, Roode was on the defense too much against some no-name jobber.

Eric Young vs. A-1 - This was just the opening match to get the crowd pumped since the Impact Zone always goes crazy for Eric Young. The match itself wasn't much since A1 can't do much.

Petey Williams vs. Jay Lethal - This was actually a good X-division bout between two young stars but at this time, the focus on the X-division was to put over the ""Jackass 2"" movie and that came across poorly in this match as Williams had to sell the fact that he was slipped laxatives which made the whole match look completely stupid. Don't expect to see this on ""Best Of The X Division Vol. 3""

No Disqualification Match: Raven vs. Runt vs. Abyss - This was actually better to me than the Monster's Ball match they did the next month at Bound For Glory as this was just a good brawl. Runt took some sick punishment as not all the spots go as planned which actually hurts worse than if the bumped went as planned. This was also the hardest I've seen Raven work in almost a year. This match really picked up the PPV.

Triple Chance Battle Royal - The rules are that when both members of a team are eliminated from the battle royal, they're out. When two wrestlers are remaining, they're partners come back for a tradition tag team match. Once the battle royal part was done, it was down to AMW & The Naturals. This was mainly a match to give The Naturals that ""underdog"" win to catapult them into the next level & continue the storyline with Shane Douglas while start up a storyline between the James Gang & AMW. Another match that was good for what it was but look out for Chase Stevens toss into the crowd.
(Also available on ""Best Of Tag Teams Vol. 1"")

X Division Champion Senshi vs. Chris Sabin - Eventhough it was slow at some parts, the match started getting real good when it picked up RIGHT UNTIL THE ENDING. Sabin threw a blowup doll into the ring and....well, the less I say the better but this ""Jackass 2"" stuff ruined both X division matches on this card to the point where the crowd was chanting ""THIS IS STUPID!!!"" Their Bound For Glory match heavily made up for this a month later.
And the only funny thing about all of this is that the ""Jackass 2"" guys ditched TNA & went to WWE to promote their movie which made the whole storyline completely pointless.

Rhino vs. Christian Cage - Another match that picked up the PPV from the drought that it was in as they went back & forth while telling the story of Rhino having a severe concussion but never giving up after getting DDT on the rampway. Christian was completely ruthless & the most aggressive he's been since his feud with Abyss. Both men came off still looking strong after this & another match I enjoyed better than their Bound For Glory encounter.

Ultimate X Match: AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels vs. LAX - This was the match TNA fans voted as the match of the year & you can understand why after seeing it. There was alot of unique spots & different ways of trying to get the belts (ala Homocide getting a ladder) that which made this Ultimate X standout above the others. Also, I have to get props to Hernandez because for him being the big muscle man, this didn't have a problem adapting to a match that is strictly for ""smaller"" wrestlers.
(Also available on ""Best Of A.J. Styles Vol. 2)

Fan's Revenge Match: Samoa Joe vs. Jeff Jarrett - I have no idea why this was put on AFTER that Ultimate X match except for the fact that Jarrett, THINKING he's the top draw in the company, has to be involved in all the top angles in the company so he has to be in the ring for the big announcement at the end. Anyways, this was nothing more than a comedic gimmick match that went a little over 10 mins. with Jarrett getting in just as much offense as Joe. The ending of Joe choking out Jarrett was something everyone expected but it didn't matter in the end as this was a non-title match, everyone (including TNA itself) looked past this match & was more focused on Sting's match the next month, and no body cared that he walked out with title belt after the announcement at the end of the show...which was Kurt Angle joining TNA. Bottom line is that just like Bound For Glory...the tag team match should have been the match to end the show since this looked pathetic in comparison.

In the end, there were only 3 matches on here that are worth watching over & over again...but one of them (the Ultimate X match) was available on another DVD that's more bang for your buck. This is one event I would pass on because you honestly aren't missing much past the 3 out of 9 matches.",1202083200,5,5156,4.372651356993737
