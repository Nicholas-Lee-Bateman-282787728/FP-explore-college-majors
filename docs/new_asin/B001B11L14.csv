This film/home movie is like those horrible wedding videos when the guy walks aroung table to table asking to record your thoughts on the bride and groom. There is 2 minutes of bad quality black and white film of Dennis at the end but nothing more here. I really don't care what all his High school friends thought the first time they saw him, yuk. Believe me, thats 99% of this. It is poorly done with phones ringing in the background, kids talking in the background, poor lighting etc. Like a very bad school project. Somebody please present a better doc. on Dennis then this! Real footage, real interviews , how about a song of his PLEASE!",1238544000,18,707,4.446153846153846

3477711,5,B001B11L14,"This is not a documentary in the true sense of the word, but it's priceless interviews and recollections with the people who knew him best. Billy Hinsche's sister was married to Denny's brother Carl, and Hinsche's status as a Wilson family member as well as a touring member of the Beach Boys gives him access to everyone in the Beach Boys world.",1221264000,3,346,4.596774193548387
3477712,2,B001B11L14,"Hopefully they will soon make a better documentary on Dennis than this. Hopefully when they do so they won't use a camcorder in the most ridiculous settings to record their interviews.(without the kids or ringing phones in the backround,lol)Maybe they will also include some of his original music in it as well. I want so badly to be able to buy a dvd about Dennis Wilson that truly deserves five stars. This does not. Some of these interviews are boring while others are embarrasing and the song by Billy Hinsce at the end sounds like it was written the night before he finished the project. Too much attention is given to his role as a sex symbol,focus on his music more. And I don't just mean the Sunflower classic ""Forever"".More attention needs to be given to ""P.O.B."", and especially the ""Bambu"" tracks which finally are available. I would not be surprised if some of the people being interviewed here were unaware of the fact that these interviews would actually be used for a ""finished documentary"".Quite honestly I don't care what John Stamos has to say about Dennis Wilson. Al Jardine and the other members of the wilson family here make a little more sense as they have some memorable stories to tell about a person they actually knew. I hope there is another documentary in the works right now. Anyone who appreciates his music would jump at the chance to buy it. Inluding me. One final comment;One of the people interviewed here says""She misses Dennis's soul"".Wow. I don't know about anyone else but when I listen to Dennis Wilson's music,his soul is RIGHT THERE.",1219449600,31,1575,4.751824817518248

8280884,1,B001B11L14,"If nothing else, DENNIS WILSON FOREVER, a home video marketed as a documentary, could inspire a professional filmmaker to tell the story of the late recording artist Dennis Wilson, best known as the original drummer of the Beach Boys.  Any music fan age 50 or older would have to include Wilson's untimely 1983 death at age 39 as among the most frustrating, tragic losses of the rock and roll era.

DENNIS WILSON FOREVER (""Forever"" is the signature song of the drummer's Beach Boys career), which came out in 2008, rambles through interview clips of individuals sharing anecdotes about the man.  Some of them might interest you were it not for the uninteresting comments that dominate the film.  There is no narrative and barely any footage of Wilson, let alone any of his music, as if the budget for this film allowed only for the video camera used to shoot the interviews.

Hardcore Beach Boys fans may want to see this because Al Jardine, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston appear.  Brian Wilson is not among the interview subjects.",1465776000,,1029,4.785310734463277

8280886,1,B001B11L14,"...the creator of this Dennis Wilson docu would have included more film material (with sound, please!) on Dennis Wilson.

After having watched the docus ""The Beach Boys: An American Band"" and ""Brian Wilson: I just wasn't made for these Times"", I expected a similarly interesting docu on Dennis Wilson, the drummer of the Beach Boys who is hardly seen in any of the Beach Boys music clips.

Don't get me wrong, the interviews are without any doubt very interesting. People like Desi Arnaz Jr, David Cassidy, Dave Hutton (Three Dog Night) and relatives/in-laws like Wendy & Carnie Wilson, Marilyn Wilson and friends from high school tell about their times with Dennis Wilson.
Some of the interviews were unfortunately taking place outdoors on a bench next to a busy road, so it was hard to understand what Dennis' ex-wife told the interviewer. They should have watched the dailies and re-do the interview with her inside.

But my biggest disappointment: why was there so very little film material on Dennis Wilson himself? Once in a while we get to see a blurry black & white pic of him in-between interviews and at the end there is a very short home movie without sound that has been filmed in an airplane. But I bet other viewers were hoping for more Dennis Wilson clips with sound, too. Wilson must have been interviewed as well. So why didn't the makers of this docu include at least one Dennis Wilson interview to make this a more rounded documentary?
Why didn't they include his 2 or 3 greatest songs?
My recommendation for the creators of this film: watch ""The Beach Boys: An American Band"", it will teach you how to create a good music docu.

Hopefully somebody in the future will create a docu on Dennis Wilson that will be worthy of his memory. This one isn't :(.",1383436800,2,1771,4.684887459807074
8280887,1,B001B11L14,"......I really felt that I'd been taken.  (a real ""slap-in-the-face"" for a true Beach Boy fan).  I watched it for around 15 minutes; and discovered that this was gonna take the same route of Carl's home movie.  In about a 2 hour time frame, I threw three ""movies?"" in the trash absolutely disgusted.",1371600000,3,299,4.60377358490566
8280888,2,B001B11L14,"This film should have either been called ""Dennis Wilson:White-Washed,"" or it could have also been called
""Dennis Wilson: Eulogy-30 Years in the Making.""

I've been a lifelong Beach Boys fan, I grew up listening to them from the earliest recordings, all the way to the Stars & Stripes ""country"" album.  And everything in between.  I've read all I could get my hands on, regarding TBB, and while I think Brian WAS the brains of the group, I do realize the entire band had talent in massive amount.

That said, this documentary was really just a bunch of random interviews with friends, family, musicians and acquaintances, all talking about how wonderful Dennis was.  After about a third of the way into this doc, I realized I'm in for some propaganda.  Nowhere is mentioned his friendship with Manson, his chronic drug use/abuse, his being near homeless by choice in the mid-late 70's or even his death by drowning.  It was just a happy horse-s**t doc with everybody telling goofy antidotes about how silly Dennis was or what a great drummer Dennis was.  Half way through the film, it did kinda take on a ""Eulogy"" feeling.  When all you say are the good things, when you idealize the person, rather then a frank, ""warts `n' all"" documentary, which I foolishly thought I would see.

One more gripe:  There isn't ONE NOTE heard of ANY Beach Boy tunes OR Dennis Wilson tunes.  The only footage of Wilson found is at the very end, where you get a few minutes of B&W stuff from 1974.
Seeing how this film was made by those who knew & loved Dennis Wilson, it's a shame they couldn't put some music on this thing... There's a wealth of old 70's TV footage loaded with Dennis singing lead with the Beach Boys... Just spend a lil time on Youtube.

I LOVE The Beach Boys, individually and collectively... I did not care for this ""documentary"" al all.",1284336000,7,1839,4.604294478527607

8280890,3,B001B11L14,"Don't get me wrong...there are a few interesting insights and anecdotes shared by those interviewed regarding the subject. for example, it was cool to hear what mike love and bruce johnston had to say about their deceased bandmate in a new interview. however, i think i would have enjoyed more a proper documentary including archival footage and interviews with dennis himself (there are a some that exist...just check on youtube). fans of dennis should search out the book Dumb Angel...To me this is a definitive tribute to his legacy. Also, pick up his solo record , Pacific Ocean Blue. Although, i reckon you already have that music if you're reading this review.",1270771200,3,666,4.955357142857143
8280891,1,B001B11L14,"This video is very poorly done.  The sound quality is very poor.  There is no background music with the interviews.  It is nice to hear stories about Dennis, but this is just so poorly done that its hard to get through.  I will not be watching it again anytime soon.",1267833600,9,266,4.26
