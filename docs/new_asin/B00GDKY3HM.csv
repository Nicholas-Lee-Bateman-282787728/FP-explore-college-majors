Covers footwork, slipping, bobbing and weaving, destructions and disruption of balance. Covers use of jab, cross, back fist, hammer hand, hooks, uppercuts, elbow, knees, foot trips, foot traps and entries. Explains timing, angles of attack and defense/offense techniques.

8622373,5,B00GDKY3HM,"Great DVD. Guro Torre teaches well, all the other 5 start commentators are correct about what they said.
I was expecting more drills on the Guntings, Guro Torre does not focus much on guntings, unlike the Panantukan videos by Guro Harley Elmore. Overall it still deserves 5 stars. The coverage on kicks and guntings could be DVD 3 and DVD 4.",1507766400,,341,4.60655737704918
