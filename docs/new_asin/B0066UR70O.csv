I had hope for something a little more involved in the two step and triple two step categories. This was honestly more of a sampler than a lesson.",1442188800,,249,4.813953488372093
8494221,5,B0066UR70O,"This was our first 101 DVD from the Trautmans and it was exactly what we needed.  We weren't sure on the differences between the 2-step and triple 2 and not only did this DVD explain that, it also taught the basics of both.  Plus it covered some really cool line dances made for couples.  Without a doubt an excellent place to start for beginners to country dancing.  Highly recommend!  Oh yeah, and my wife said to mention she loved the music too ; )",1398902400,,451,4.321428571428571

8494223,5,B0066UR70O,"Country Dance 101 is an excellent introduction to country line and partner dancing.  The low-key atmosphere, friendly instructors, and ease of following the steps was very helpful.  The dance choices are easy enough that the stress level is very low, if any is present.  Practice without and with music builds a confidence in the student; progress moves at speed student chooses.  I'm anxious to move on to more DVDs, honing skills and learning new dances.
Thanks, Shawn and Joanna!!!",1334707200,4,484,5.0886075949367084
