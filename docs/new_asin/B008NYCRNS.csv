8529275,3,B008NYCRNS,"If Chinese movie industry has Detective Dee, Korean movie industry has Detective K, a period mystery about the dynastys brilliant (if occasionally bumbling) detective of the title played by Kim Myung-min. Based on a novel by Kim Tak-Hwan, the film is more like a period action comedy than a genuine mystery drama. While the film also touches upon some delicate issues like religion, it never takes itself too seriously.

Set in the late 18th century Korea, the time of the King of Joseon, Detective K: Secret of Virtuous Widow follows the story of the eponymous detective and trusted aide of the monarch. Now the detective (after wrongly accused of murder) is tasked to uncover secrets and conspiracies surrounding recent murders.

The twist-filled story also features a dog fancier Seo-pil (Oh Dal-su) who becomes Watson-like partner to the usually brilliant detective, as well as a mysterious lady Han Kaek-ju (Han Ji-min).

Dont expect stylish, big-budget action sequences of Guy Ritchie-directed Sherlock Homes films or Tsui Harks over-the-top action stunts. Keep in mind that Detective K: Secret of Virtuous Widow is much more light-hearted, leaning on jokes that are often very silly, and perhaps you will enjoy watching the film.",1432771200,2,1236,5.232323232323233

8529277,1,B008NYCRNS,"First, unless you are a speed writer, you'll never be able to read the subtitles as they speed by you, replete with spelling errors, poor grammatical construction, and so on.

Second, the story itself is something like a comedy, a kind of bumbling Inspector Clouseau.  It is a totally forgettable movie, and I shall never rely on just one other review again when I order a new movie.  Avoid this at all costs.",1388016000,,409,4.575342465753424
8529278,5,B008NYCRNS,I loved it!!!  It reminds me of Van Gulik's book on Judge Dee.  I can only hope they follow this with another Detective K!!  The ending is Open and it could happen....I hope.  I would see any of Mr. Kim's films after Beethoven Virus and I bought Detective K to continue my admiration for his talent and work!,1353888000,2,308,4.258620689655173
