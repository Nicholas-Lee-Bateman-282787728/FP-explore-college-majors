8263015,2,B0016KZTG8,"This was one of Kentucky's greatest wins in history.  I was at the game, so I looked forward to purchasing this video so I could watch the telecast.  I was disappointed it wasn't in High Def (blu-ray) but understand that was probably asking too much.  My main objection to this video is its a horrible video transfer.  Honestly, it reminds me of a friend who taped the game on VHS and copied it onto another VHS cassette.  With today's technology, the video transfer is just downright atrocious.  The video is grainy and wiped out.

I suspect the length of the game required the producers of the disc to lower the bandwidth significantly to fit it on one disc.  A highlight of this problem is the producers actually cut away a play from LSU's last attempt at a first down (I believe it was the third down play!) during the triple overtime and then cut away immediately after LSU is stopped on fourth down.  Hey, I would have preferred they cut away a couple of series from the first quarter.  In the end, this disc is a major disappointment.  I would have gladly paid more for a two disc set, and certainly paid a premium for one high-def Blu-ray disc.

Its a great game, if you don't mind watching it in crummy video.",1280620800,,1218,4.436936936936937
8263016,5,B0016KZTG8,"This is an excellent video of this historic game in the annals of UK sports. This dvd contains the entire game, all 4 heart-pumping quarters and more. You see the great players of the time, and coaches Miles & Brooks, working hard to bring home a victory. UK qb Andre Woodson shines, with back-breaking passes to Stevie Johnson and Jacob Tamme, as well as Keenan Burton. Also, Rafael Little breaks free for some drive-extending runs. And it takes you into the overtimes that added so much more to the instant classic qualities of this great, great game! It all culminates with one of UK's all-time defensive stands, and an all-out celebration for the Big Blue!",1279324800,,660,4.747826086956522
