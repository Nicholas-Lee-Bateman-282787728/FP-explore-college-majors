Unforgiving and relentless, The Street Fighter shows scenes that will make you want to turn your head. Action, excitement and adventure. All martial arts fans will enjoy this movie.",1394409600,2,340,4.982456140350878

4715859,4,B005K8RJNS,"Like all Popflix sets, there are five films spread across two discs. The reason to buy this set is the first disc: THE STREET FIGHTER, RETURN OF THE STREET FIGHTER, and THE STREET FIGHTER'S LAST REVENGE all in one place, all in widescreen (albeit non-anamorphic), all for very cheap.

The important things to note about this set is that 1) the films are all uncut. The violence for which these films are known is intact. 2) The films are in 4:3 letterboxed widescreen, so they will appear windowboxed on a widescreen set. I watched them on my 27"" computer screen in VLC. All I had to do for full widescreen presentation was ""crop"" the image to 16x9 so that it would fill out onto my screen without any loss of quality of warping of proportions. While the prints here do not look too good, you're getting the uncut films in their proper aspect ratios. That is the the main point.

Also of note: all the films are dubbed. Unfortunate, but it is all we have.

The other two films are available in better quality elsewhere.

The Street Fighter series is totally awesome and will give you plenty of joy. Sure, I wish they looked better, but I'm more than happy to have them uncut and in widescreen.",1378598400,18,2124,6.214285714285714
4715860,5,B005K8RJNS,"I love Sonny Chiba and this collection is awesome.  Sonny Chiba does what Sonny Chiba does best: kick serious butt.
If you are watching it thinking he is a hero then you are sadly mistaken.  He is an anti-hero to the extreme.  Does he show mercy?  No.  So you better pay up or you will fly out the window.  This was shown in the first movie.
If you want to find out more on Sonny Chiba then I recommend Tokyo Scope by Patrick Macias.  It has quite a few articles on Sonny Chiba.  And yes he was in Kill Bill.
So, if you like old school martial arts then look no further because Sonny Chiba will deliver... with a jump kick to the chest!  I believe he can be the real Kenshiro from Hokuto no Ken... or maybe Raoh.",1369180800,,712,4.0647482014388485

4715862,3,B005K8RJNS,"I got into Sonny Chiba because of the funny commentary that James Rolfe, the Angry Video Game Nerd, did for Street Fighter. This set has all 3 Street Fighter movies as well as one of the sequels, Sister Street Fighter. The quality isn't nearly as good as the version that's in this set...

But the fuzziness sort of adds to the cheesy fun of the movies. You'll never see another martial arts actor quite like Sonny Chiba. These movies are a lot of fun. Just a note, these movies aren't anamorphic. So, so to see them in their correct ratio, you'll have to zoom in. On my tv, it has something called Pix1, Pix2, etc. On my computer, powerdvd has a smart stretch for 2.35:1 option.",1333497600,6,835,5.333333333333333

8476624,4,B005K8RJNS,"This time Ill talk about a film in the public domain, at least I think it is, called The Street Fighter. Its not that movie based on the videogame but a series of grindhouse action films by Sonny Chiba. Before being in Kill Bill he was doing action movies in the 1970s and is considered the Steven Segal of Japan at the time. In The Street Fighter Sonny Chiba plays a mercenary named Terry for the yakuza.

After doing a favor for the yakuza by saving a death row prisoner. When a rich guy dies and leaves all of his fortune to his daughter in Japan the yakuza order Terry to kidnap her. Terry refuses because he wanted more money and then the yakuza end up ordering to kill him. Theres also a fight scene where Terry fights a martial arts master at a dojo and has a change of heart at the end of the fight. He ends up protecting her at his service free of charge. Theres even a subplot where theres these people out to get him for being half Chinese.

This was also Quentin Tarantinos inspiration to do films when he saw this in theaters back in the 1970s. This is a pretty violent film and at archive.org they only got the dubbed version which is kinda bad. I guess thats what makes this film so good because of it. Havent seen the sequels except Sister Street Fighter which is also on the archive.org site to if you want to take a look.",1434067200,,1339,4.206225680933852
8476625,4,B005K8RJNS,If you love classic 70s Kung Fu flicks then you really can't go wrong with the street fighter series.  Only fly in the ointment?  Sister street fighter in this collection is the censored version (check out www.movie-censorship.com for more information).  The picture quality is a bit rough for some of the movies but overall (IMO) not a big deal.,1416960000,,346,4.830508474576271
