300385,5,6300271528,"The first time I saw this film, it touched my heart.  Amy Madigan stars as Terry Jean Moore, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who winds up serving a prison sentence for armed robbery.  This story fascinates me on many levels because it occurred in my home state (Florida) and it opened my eyes to what life is like for women in prison.  Moore is portrayed as a foul-mouthed, hot-tempered tomboy who can never seem to stay out of trouble...she is white trash.  She is smart but makes all the wrong choices.  She is quick with her fists and walks with a hip-swaying swagger, always on the defensive.  Until she meets correctional officer Jack Hansen, played brilliantly by Beau Bridges.  He is attracted to the scared, vulnerable little girl beneath Terry's tough-as-nails exterior and they begin a clandestine affair, making love in a secret location.  Terry eventually winds up with a bun in the oven and the dilemma of what will happen when her pregnancy is discovered.

She wants more than anything to keep the life growing within her...it symbolizes new hopes and dreams of a better life, a future beyond the walls of prison.  But the powers that be threaten to destroy this possibility.  She will be forced to terminate the pregnancy, or else turn her baby over to the state of Florida.  What happens?  You'll have to watch to find out.

This movie, for me, was phenomenal.  Amy Madigan is convincing as the angry young woman with a softer side.  Beau Bridges is great as the charming officer who wins her heart...and ultimately hurts her in the end when she learns the truth about him.  Mackenzie Phillips plays the tough-talking, but kind lesbian who befriends Terry in prison.  And Albert Salmi (RIP) is Capt. Ellis, the officer who is stern yet fatherly towards Terry, recognizing that she is troubled but not hopeless.

There are moments that show Terry for who she truly is behind the bravado. The soundtrack at the end, by Carly Simon, illustrates this beautifully.  Terry was a troubled kid when she first entered the prison system but she emerges as a woman with a new sense of purpose and a chance to start anew.  ""Love Child"" is about growing up, learning from one's mistakes, taking responsibility for one's actions and getting second chances in life.  It is about redemption and self-reflection.  Shame that this movie isn't more popular because it is such a moving story.  I hope the real Terry is living a happy life and is finally at peace.",1393718400,2,2468,4.712616822429907
300386,4,6300271528,"It's a story that made national headlines and was covered on 60 Minutes. Convicted and jailed for armed robbery in 1977, Terry Jean Moore fell in love with a prison guard and became pregnant.

She then took on Florida courts in a historic legal battle to keep and raise her child behind bars. Amy Madigan made her movie debut as Moore in a performance called ""riveting"" by Gene Shalit of NBC-TV's Today and ""fine and affecting"" by Carrie Rickey of The Village Voice.

Ultimate praise for the future Field of Dreams and Places in the Heart co-star came from Moore herself: ""It was me there, it really was."" Beau Bridges as the guard, Mackenzie Phillips as a fellow inmate and Margaret Whitton as Moore's attorney give strong support in a movie that rings with truth - and moves with its simple and direct power.

This drama flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 10 years old in the 4th grade during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1982 was Ronald Reagan was the President & we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",1391990400,2,1072,4.459183673469388

300390,5,6300271528,"This movie was so compelling, I could relate to Terry-Jean's troubles only I never went to prison, but my life was pretty bad growing up! This movie shows that despite the worst circumstances, you can overcome anything if you are strong enough to fight for yourself! I only wish they would make a D.V.D to keep up with the new technology, I can't wait to get this movie, I just ordered it, and I haven't seen it since 1988 on television, I was oly thirteen, and I'm just turning thirty this summer so I know I can really understand this movie better than I did as a child, I'm sure I missed a lot of important things That perhaps I didn't understand at the time. Anyone considering seeing this movie will not be disapointed.......",1119484800,5,730,4.455223880597015
300391,5,6300271528,"I thought this was a fantastic movie.  I thought so many years ago, I just finished watching it again this morning, and I still think so now.  Terry was a victim of the system.  People make mistakes. I hope Terry and her daughter turned out alright over the years.",1112140800,4,264,4.346938775510204

7808530,1,6300271528,"There is no way to give a negative number, or I would. The story line in the movie is truly an act of fiction. Terry Moore stole her own grandmother's social security checks and beat her up as well as stealing meds. She stole from a boyfriend and that 5.00 robbery, was with a gun, at that time in Florida, a weapon got you ten years for a first offense...they let her out way too early. That robbery also involved taking the clerk hostage because they couldn't drive the car she wanted to steal. She didn't fall in love with anyone, she asked a friend during a visit if she could get out if she got ""knocked up"" and then did. She wasn't abused by the system, she played the system. Before she got out of jail she was working to get a deal for a doll named after her daughter & the brainchild had to ask a prison worker how to spell Precious and adding Agnes for the grandmother she abused was supposed to make it better. Terry told people all over town she was wanted in Ohio. Knowing the facts, makes this tripe even more disgusting.",1409097600,,1035,4.232323232323233
