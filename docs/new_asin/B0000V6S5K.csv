1949598,1,B0000V6S5K,"Yes, this is a great film - I can understand why people rave about it. My review is a warning about the import region 2 UK DVD being sold by some Amazon sellers. It's absolutely dreadful - the sound is ok, but the picture is a mess and clearly taken from an old VHS tape (zoom back on the picture and you can see signs of VHS head switching). It's also been through an NTSC-PAL conversion, so watching it in North America will mean giving it another conversion back to NTSC - the DVD already has barely any detail in it, so another conversion will likely finish it off completely. The disc is from Orbit Media, who are a public domain specialist (the film is actually be owned by Universal). It looks worse than any bootleg.",1158537600,28,724,4.330882352941177

1949741,5,B0000V6S5K,"Fun, fun, fun movie and a great blend of comedy and scares!  I absolutely love the old B&W ""spooky house"" mysteries and this is one of my favorites.  The plot is basically about a young woman (Paulette Goddard) named as the sole inheritor of a very large fortune but with a provision the other relatives will inherit if she goes insane within the next 30 days.  Cue the spooky goings on at a very creepy mansion!  Bob Hope (playing one of the relatives) can deliver a line like nobody else and this movie certainly shows why he was such a hugely popular entertainer.  The audio and visual transfer to DVD is excellent but be aware this will only play on Blu-Ray or ""play only"" DVD sets.",1487376000,2,686,4.412698412698413

1949744,4,B0000V6S5K,"This is actually a Paramount Picture not Universal but much like the classic horror movies we all know and love. It's typical story of a group
being called to a mansion out in the middle of nowhere to hear the reading of the will and people get murdered. Of course there's no blood
and gore and has Bob Hope doing great one liners so it's not only a mystery it's a comedy. I don't have this DVD but I have another copy
and it's as most described as not very good quality but watchable. My copy has some scenes that seem to be cut right in middle of dialogue
so it's not edited properly. Too bad a better copy isn't remasters like Ghost Breakers another great Bob Hope mystery comedy.",1483228800,,683,4.2615384615384615

In the beginning, Erasmus just has to contend with schoolwork and an exasperating younger brother, but it isn't long before he has more pressing problems. Literally, as he is taken by one of the infamous press gangs.

1949801,4,B0000V6S5K,"The Cat and the Canary, 1939 film

This is set in the bayous of Louisiana, not far from New Orleans. There is an old mansion only reached by boat. The door squeaks, it is dark in the night. The housekeeper is never lonely, she has spirit friends. The presumed heirs must spend the night there. The lawyer notes the will has been tampered with, but he made a copy. The electric lights flicker. One heir is a radio actor, Wally Campbell. Lawyer Crosby reads the first part of the will. They hear a chime sound. Miss Lew explains the meaning. One of the guests will die overnight. If the heir dies or goes insane in a month the second will inherit. Only one has the name Norman. Will the housekeeper stay? Is an expensive necklace hidden somewhere? Then the lights go out for a minute. Where did Miss Lew go? Talk continues to entertain and pad out this story.

Then a shot interrupts the meal! The Head Guard from a local asylum tells about an escaped killer, The Cat. Lock the doors and windows says the guard. Wally goes to lock the cellar door. Miss Norman reads in the library, lawyer Crosby tells her she is in danger. Then he suddenly disappears! No one has seen him! Did the demon of this house get him? Miss Norman goes to her bedroom. She is advised to lock her door. [Note the obsolete light switches and door locks.] There is a clue in the letter to that missing diamond and emerald necklace. Joyce and Wally find it! There is a movement by the window drapes; its a black cat. After Joyce goes to bed a hand reaches out of the wall to threaten her! The necklace is gone! The others doubt her story. Wally opens a secret panel and the missing lawyer reappears!

What can the people do? They are isolated. They hear the clock chime six times, another warning. Wally gives Joyce a loaded gun for protection. [The Second Amendment was operative before the 1970s.] There is more drama before the solution to this murder mystery.

This was adapted from a stage play by John Willard.",1460505600,2,1985,4.4301369863013695

It doesn't have the usual Hope antics or as many of his one-liners since the dialogue is taken directly from the stage play. It's still witty enough, however. Though it may seem mild compared to today's slasher movies, it offered plenty of chills as well as laughs in its day and is a good example of a Bob Hope movie. There are a few plot point which some might consider inaccurate, such as having Native Americans living in the bayou.

1949833,5,B0000V6S5K,"The granddaddy of Scooby-do(at least in my children's eyes), Bob Hope, in wonderfully funny, and more so creepy, well done mystery that pulls out all the stops in the 'stuck in a haunted house over night with a maniac and killer loose' genre.

The reading of a will brings relatives to a isolated, bayou plantation house.  Unable to leave until morning, the guests are subject to ghostly doings and murder, and Bob's one liners.  Actually, Bob Hope is super in this, and my kids sighed with relief when he shows up to add some levity to an otherwise pretty spooky tale especially for 1939.  ""It gave me shivers,"" my 11 year old said.

There's, of course, no blood and guts, but there is a lot of scary situations and shadowy suggestive horror.  Overall, we all loved it.  And of course, the lovely Paulette Goddard stars again with Hope in the less but still creepy, Zombie Island movie, Ghost Breakers.

1949895,4,B0000V6S5K,"The Bob Hope/Paulette Goddard combination works very well, especially with her allure and Hope's self-deprecating humor. I'm not a particular fan of the story--try watching the 1920s silent version, it is very stilted--but this one works well. I have been a lifelong fan of the next movie featuring the pair, The Ghost Breakers. That one has everything (albeit a bit unpolitically correct), but how can you pass up zombies, haunted mansions, spooky old voodoo laden areas of Cuba and even a mystery. Look for a very young Anthony Quinn.
Back to The Cat and the Canary, it features one of my favorites, George Zucco, as the lawyer. Add a panoply of avaricious relatives looking for their inheritance, secret panels, clutching hands, a corpse or two and a pretty well appointed old mansion and the requisite mystery (who's the killer?) and you have a fun movie. Watch 'em both! If you can find it, Fred MacMurray in ""Murder He Says"" is another film along those lines, but set in the ozarks, of all places. It even has a mysterious coded song!

While the transfer is nice and crisp (along with a good audio track) there are frequent changes in the tint of the picture. This is especially bothersome during the initial arrival of the first person to the house. While being paddled through the swamp the picture frequently switches from B&W to a Green Tint reminiscent of the old school Game Boy color. As the film progresses, it happens less frequently but it still occurs.

Anyway this film starring Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard is great. I really enjoy this film and their chemistry together as well as their other movie made a year later in 1940, The Ghost Breakers, in which they would once again star in. I have wanted to own this film for quite some time since I saw it online a few years ago. I am extremely happy that I was able to buy it here for a cheap price. I ordered it Wednesday, October 10, and it arrived yesterday, Friday October the 13. The picture quality is excellent and very fine print, and I couldn't ask for a better quality then that. The sound is magnificent and perfect as well. Like one of the buyers have mentioned that the DVD case artwork isn't the best but the back of the case does contain some of the movie's quotes as well as pictures from scenes of the movie. It's worth it when you're buying it for a reasonable price and get the wonderful sound/movie quality. I definitely will be watching this time after time. A great add to my old movie collection and wouldnt be complete without it!! Im looking forward to watching this ever October for Halloween!!! I highly recommend this film as well as The Ghost Breakers, Topper Returns, Arsenic and Old Lace, Scared Stiff, Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein, The Haunting, and The Uninvited.",1350086400,,1484,4.43956043956044
1950005,4,B0000V6S5K,"Cyrus Norman was an eccentric old cuss who preferred the life of a hermit.  Few were ever permitted to see his grand Louisianan mansion with massive classic pillars; it had no street address; it sat on a bit of raised marshy land on an alligator-infested bayou; its only access by boat; its nearest neighbor: the Fairview Insane Asylum.  Perhaps that was appropriate as it was said that the Norman family tree had a few branches of insanity.

Cyrus had one servant: his housekeeper Miss Lu.  She believed herself to be spiritually attuned; her friends, who were just beyond perception, told her of things to come.  When the gong sounded, ten long years ago, she knew her master was about to pass on, quietly in his four-poster.  Just before midnight, he had given her an envelope to pass on to the sole heir to be named at the reading of the will ten years in the future; the future is now; the potential heirs are arriving. . . .

Of the six heirs, only two call Cyrus Norman - uncle:  Joyce Norman and Wally Campbell.  Before the night is over, there will be flickering lights, screams, disappearances, and a shared kiss making Joyce and Wally kissing cousins. . . .

Overall:  The film's spooky atmospherics, mix of eccentric characters, and steady pacing makes it an enjoyable watch as long as you are not too concerned about everything making sense.

A hallmark of Hope's humor, is an occasional political joke; in this 1939 film, it's the Republicans who get ribbed; in Hope's 1940 film, ""The Ghost Breakers,"" it's the Democrats turn.

1950008,4,B0000V6S5K,"In the late 1930's Bob Hope was a big star on radio with a dozen films on his resume, but with ""The Cat And the Canary"" he was catapulted to stardom. The following year he would make ""THE GHOST BREAKERS"" and that film would make him a superstar. Although the film is not hysterical it does have funny moments. Bob Hope plays his usual wisecracking, cowardly comedic hero. Hopes funniest line is a jab at the republicans, which he must have regretted saying years later. The movie is an atmosheric chiller dealing with the heirs of a fortune spending the night in a haunted mansion in the bayou with a killer on the loose. Paulette Goddard plays the beautiful heiress with restraint and believability. She and Bob Hope have a wonderful chemistry. Its no wonder they were teamed again for ""THE GHOST BREAKERS"". Of course what would a horror film be without those two stalwarts of terror George Zucco and Gale Sondergard. Zucco exudes menace as the family lawyer while Sondergard is creepy as the housekeeper who communicates with the dead. Elliot Nugent directs the comedy and chills with equal depthness. The last scene where the killer chases Paulette through the secret passage way of the mansion is eerie and suspenseful.  The disc quality is very good with a sharp picture and clear sound.  The only fault on the disc is it has a color signal which pops in and out. So for best results just turn off your color and sit back and enjoy a classic comedy thriller.

I breathed a deep sigh of relief when I got the disk into the player and saw the quality of the image. The case design is not altogether reassuring, as I could see on Amazon. The label on the disk is obviously home-printed. And I had been having a kind of buyer's remorse on reflecting that I had chosen the very cheapest offering on Amazon at $9.95. However, the content is an excellent print from a beautiful master. This time, I escaped re-learning the truth of the adage, ""You get what you pay for."" The disk does start with a commercial for Gozillaflix, but that's a low price to pay in addition to the $9.95. Also, the DVD is an all-region edition, as advertised.

Bob Hope as usual, doing his Burlesque-style Comedy bits, and whimsical scaredey-cat/hero, but in the end, he's the hero, as usual. I can't stand Paulette Goddard's lousy acting. She must be the Directors relative or something, because her acting was lame in this movie. She puts so little into her character, that it sometimes makes you angry. But Bob Hope keeps the movie moving along anyway. Funny thing in this movie, there is some unseen character they refer to as Mr. Crosby. NO, Bing doesn't make a cameo appearence. This movie is almost a Family Type movie, except kiddies might get bored with Hopes constant Mushy references to Paulette. Overdoing it sometimes.",1318118400,,729,4.887096774193548

1950040,5,B0000V6S5K,"While the plot was an ancient one when this late thirties film was made, Bob Hope made it highly entertaining, as he took another big step to film stardom, to match his quick rise in prime time radio. No better 'Damsel in Distress' could have been found than the radiant beauty, Paulette Goddard, who fit the role perfectly (certainly better than when later called upon to be ""serious""). She is anything but a shrinking violet but still plays well the role of the usually independent woman who happens to need a man in a frightening situation. Yes, in the thirties, independent woman still needed men, even one as customarily timid as the part Bob plays. Of course, he plays to a ""T"" the role of the guy whose wisecracks mask a very shaky interior, who, naturally, rises to the occasion when faced by a lovely lady in need.
This was so successful for the pair that another film of the same nature was made a few years later. Titled ""The Ghost Breakers"". it received a more elaborate production and better casting. However, while that is the better film, this one, with a few strong feature players (and a number no more than B picture actors) is amply rewarding standing alone and a welcome introduction to the second. I can recommend this not only as a must for those who are old enough to be nostalgic about the film and its times because they were around to see it first run, but also to anyone of any age who can accommodate to the expectations of that period in order to have some simple fun.",1284940800,9,1497,4.487179487179487

1950043,5,B0000V6S5K,"My introduction to the team of Bob hope and public Goddard was the movie ""Ghost Breakers"". In the movie, they mentioned ""The cat and the Canary"" (1939). I purchased this from Amazon UK as it currently is not available from  Amazon US. This version looks like a direct transfer from tape to DVD without any cleanup efforts. However, it is still worth the purchase.

I was not disappointed. However the cat and the Canary is very good spoof on horror movies but it does not have the sophistication of their later movie ""Ghost breakers.""

The basic story is of a millionaire who dies and leaves his estate to one person. If that person proves to be mentally unstable than the entire estate goes to a second person named in a sealed envelope. To add to this situation a strange person known as the cat has escaped from the local mental asylum.

Go ahead and let your imagination run away.

In addition, while you are doing this do not miss any of the one-liners are Bob hope or Paulette Goddard's cute smile Lord George Zucco's maniacal expressions.

8003622,5,B0000V6S5K,"In 1939, Paramount Pictures released the third film adaptation of John Willard's 1922 stage play The Cat and the Canary. This version right here just might be the second best example of the ""old dark house"" sub-genre, the first being, what else,The Old Dark Houseitself. What makes this version of The Cat and the Canary so very good is Bob Hope being cast as the movie's lily-livered but very funny hero. Star making role? Surely.

It wasn't a dark and stormy night, more like a gloomy and atmospheric late afternoon somewhere in the bayous of Louisiana, where we glimpse a man being ferried on a boat towards the old, bleak-looking Norman mansion. He is the family lawyer, come to read the will of old, decade-long-deceased Cyrus Norman, who in his time was eccentric and so crooked that ""when he died they had to screw him into the ground."" Shortly after, six farflung relations of the Norman clan gather to see who'll win the old man's fortune.

Amongst the arrivals are childhood chums, radio personality Wally Campbell (Hope) and magazine illustrator Joyce Norman (Paulette Goddard). The family lawyer reads the will and declares Joyce the sole benefactor, but with certain provisos. Due to a persistent streak of insanity that runs in the family, a second inheritor was secretly named. This person stands to gain should Joyce turn out to be of unsound mind. A further clause states that this second inheritor will also profit should Joyce meet her death within a month of inheriting (hmmm...).

The others are naturally dissatisfied and soon prepare to depart. But transportation doesn't arrive until morning, and so, they're forced to spend the night at this old dark house. Mention is off-handedly made of a treasure in the guise of a diamond and emerald-studded necklace hidden somewhere on the premises. Then the guests hear uneasy news of a crazed killer recently escaped from the local insane asylum. And, in this decaying edifice, deep-seated grudges and frayed nerves soon play out, giving rise to pangs of suspicion and a creeping-up terror. Is it a surprise that, very soon, people begin to vanish? Then, the murders begin.

I've a fondness for these moody ""old dark house"" spine-tinglers that dabbled in mystery, terror, and humor. It's so long ago, but The Cat and the Canary might've been the one that made me a Bob Hope enthusiast. At a running time of only 73 minutes, this movie clips along at a very brisk pace. Absenting the stormy weather, all the other ingredients for this sub-genre are here: creaky noises, the shady servant, a painting with eyeholes, hidden passageways, and lurking, shadowy figures. And murder, of course. What fun.

Again, it's worth noting that Bob Hope made this film stand out, as he offsets the delicious chills with his brand of cowardice and casual one-liners. By today's demanding criteria, this movie wouldn't scare the snot out of anyone above the age of nine. Nowadays, this is more a great nostalgia piece than anything. In its time, this film raked in enough box office cred and popularity to garner a reteaming of Hope and Goddard, which they do a year later in another worthy ""old dark house"" rompThe Ghost Breakers. The Cat and the Canary propelled our beady-eyed, ski-nosed comedian to success and longevity. The next year, his star status was cemented in the first of his seven road pictures with Bing Crosby,Road to Singapore.

As for Paulette Goddard, I'd only ever seen her in her two films with Hope, her two movie pairings with Chaplin, and inSecond Chorus, in which her character is romanced by Fred Astaire and Burgess Meredith. What's not to like about Paulette? She was beautiful, engaging, and had a deft and light touch with her lines. She should've made a bigger mark in Hollywood.

Meanwhile, if Hope provides the levity, then Gale Sondergaard adds much to the creepy goings-on. She's great as the sternly clad housekeeper who is also a devout spiritualist. It's she who melodramatically alerts the guests that spirits have warned her of imminent death in the household. She also persists in dropping ominous statements. When the family lawyer comments on the clock, she declares: ""It stopped when the master died."" Or when the lights ominously flicker: ""Sometimes THEY get into the machinery."" With her forbidding demeanor and detached delivery, she pulls it off quite well. And she's kinda hot. In a haughty housekeeper kind of way.

I haven't caught the silent 1927 film adaptation ofThe Cat and the Canary, but I hear good things about it. I did see the 1979 remake, with Honor Blackman, and that one's worth dusting off and eyeballing, even if it's not quite as good as this 1939 version.

For the curious, the movie title The Cat and the Canary originates from a reference in a psychology book which Joyce finds. According to numerous experiments, a canary, when placed in near proximity to a cat, will often die of fright. Another fun fact I learned thru watching this film is that, in the swamps, a woman apparently keeps her shoes on when she goes to bed.

If you were wondering about the second film adaptation of John Willard's stage play, it's titled The Cat Creeps and was released in 1930. But don't try to find it. It's considered a lost film as no prints or negatives of it are known to exist, only some stills.",1501027200,,5306,4.846578366445916
