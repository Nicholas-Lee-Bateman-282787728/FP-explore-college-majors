8764023,3,B01GWCPO7I,"Rich expatriates on the French Riviera. Psychiatrist, Dick Diver falls in love with his fabulously wealthy, extremely beautiful, and psychotic patient. Beautiful scenery, beautiful people, and a complicated love story.  The film is uneven, and I have a hard time with Jason Robards as a romantic lead. But the movie has its good points and is emotionally rewarding at the end. Not the best, but worth watching.",1491091200,,410,5.119402985074627
