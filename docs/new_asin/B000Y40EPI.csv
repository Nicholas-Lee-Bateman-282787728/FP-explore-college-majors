8230953,4,B000Y40EPI,"People have many different and pointed opinions regarding Steve Rocco's influence on the skateboarding industry. One thing is certain and undeniable. Rocco introduced myriad turns, branches, loops, and possible destinations for those trying to make a career of skateboarding. Before Rocco, a skateboarder's future was dictated by George Powell, Brad Dorfman, Larry Balma, and Fausto V. After Rocco, it was a whole different ballgame.

Those were my thoughts before watching the new documentary about the infamous pioneer in the skateboarding industry. The documentary unearthed  many stories and details about Rocco's empire through entertaining anecdotes provided by the top pros from that era. Vallely, Rocco, Martinez, Lee, Wee Man, Lotti, Klein, and of course, Mullen are the lead story-tellers, but there are plenty of cameos by the likes of Ron Chapman, Natas, Knoxville, and Larry Flynt.

It's a throughly enjoyable trip back to a not-too-distant time when pants got baggy and wheels shrank to nothing. Vert giants were crushed and contests were dismissed by video pros. The main drawback to the film is the level of Rocco's participation with the project (his brother, Pat, is one of the producers) and the unwillingness of Rodney Mullen and Jesse Martinez to speak candidly about their previous business partner. Notably absent are any lengthy discussions with the Gonz, which could mean that his comments were unacceptably critical of the subject. While the film is eager to highlight Rocco's egomania, it refuses to answer the fundamental question of this type of project: ""Where is he now?"" They interview Rocco with tight shots on his back patio, but they never give any indication of how well off he walked away from World Industries. And that's what I really wanted to know.",1201564800,6,1789,5.270175438596492
