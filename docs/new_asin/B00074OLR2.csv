2199989,5,B00074OLR2,"This DVD and CD (the whole set of 6, actually) opened the door to new communication with my nondisabled 6 year old, who loved having a ""secret language"", my nondisabled 2 year old nephew and my speech delayed 2 year old daughter,  I don't know how we ever got along without it!  A MUST HAVE for any parents interested in seeing what their child has to say!",1104278400,,356,4.298507462686567
2199990,5,B00074OLR2,"I have known deaf people since my college days, almost 20 years ago.  Despite that, despite multiple attempts to teach me, including my wife trying, I never managed to learn to finger-spell.

However, I managed to learn the entire finger-spelling alphabet AND numbers 1-10 watching this DVD.  And we didn't even get it for me.

We started signing with our son, Ethan, almost a year ago, as a result of a NY Times (Jan 6, 2004) article which told of the benefits of signing even with a hearing child.  Since infants can move their hands better than they can control their tongue, signing allows them to communicate before they can talk, and stimulates language development.  They tend to be less frustrated (as are we) because their 'requests' are understood, and they tend to learn to talk faster because they already have word concepts.

We tried signing using another system, but Ethan only picked up a few, important words like 'milk' and 'more'  However, we found a set of three videos called Signing Time which showed common signs along with catchy songs, and videos.  The 'host' Rachel Coleman demonstrated the signs, and her deaf daughter (Leah) and hearing nephew (Alex) did various videos showing the signs and helping to make connections.  Children in different developmental stages demonstrated the signs as well, to show how you might actually see them, since babies sometimes do not sign perfectly, just as they don't pronounce words perfectly.

Ethan loved these videos, and learned a number of signs, including Thank You (which he uses and says 'tank' at the same time)and when we found out that there was another set of three videos coming out, we immediately pre-ordered them.

In this video, Rachel shows signs for each letter of the alphabet in turn, and signs for words starting with that letter.  She demonstrates the sign, and explains how you can remember how to do it.  Every few signs she sings a song that showcases the letters and more words with those letters.  My wife watches the videos to learn other signs from the song that are not featured, but that she wants to use.  I am still working on the basics, but as the title says, have picked up the letters.

Ethan is just starting on his ABCs at 19 months, and gets more out of the other videos.  But he recognizes when we finger-spell his name, and I expect that it is just a matter of time before he starts finger-spelling himself.  And now, I can understand when he does.

Like all of the Signing Times! DVDs I highly recommend this one for anyone interested in learning the ASL alphabet from ages 8 months to 80.",1104192000,,2597,4.716186252771618
2199991,5,B00074OLR2,"This is the best of all of the Signing Time videos!  Both my five and three year old love this video.  It's one of the few things they'll watch together.

Not only does Rachel cover all of the ABCs, but you will learn 2 to 3 words per ABC that correspond to the letter (for example, for ""B"" you will learn ""Baseball"" and ""bat"").  Her ABC song is incredibly catchy.  It's really fun to listen to.

She also covers the numbers 1-10 in ASL.

There is a rather funny song at the end of the video, while the credits roll, called ""X"".  It's sung from the letter X's perspective, being a lonely letter that people fear when they play scrabble. ""Oh no! Not X, anything but X!""

If you can only afford one of the videos in the new set (volumes 4-6) I recommend getting this one.

It's only a half hour long, but I'd have to say it's still worth Amazon's price.",1103414400,2,851,4.1656441717791415

The signing may seem a bit fast when Rachel goes through the whole song at the end, but be sure to watch the special features where she goes through it slowly and takes the time to explain each sign & breaks down the song too.

2200007,5,B00074OLR2,I would give this one 10 stars if I could.  My child is on the Autism spectrum and is completely absorbed in the ABC's and books and reading so this volume especially gets a work out at my home.  I also can use the signs when he is pointing to things and it has helped him relate to what I am saying and doing.,1365811200,,310,3.828125

2200015,4,B00074OLR2,"We are a big fan of the Baby Signing Time series in our house! My son is almost 2-years-old, and we received the ABC Signs DVD as part of a promotional offer from Signing Time. As our first introduction to the Signing Time DVD series, I found it very informative and fun. Throughout the video, Rachel introduces viewers to the ASL sign for each letter of the alphabet, and associates two or three words with each letter. Unfortunately, she doesn't show the signs for the words that she is introducing, and that's the only downside to this movie. I would certainly recommend it.",1348617600,,577,4.611650485436893

The songs are great, but there's no way I can learn how to sign the ABCs from this video.  I REALLY REALLY doubt my son picked up on any of it.  I am teaching him sign language due to a speech delay, and he's been able to pick up most/all signs from the first 5 DVDs in this series.  I am very disappointed in this DVD.",1323043200,2,444,3.9

2200022,5,B00074OLR2,"We have all the volumes of the Signing Time DVDs (Series One), and love them.  But this one -- with the GREAT special features -- is by far the best of the bunch.  They cover so many additional signs that are not in the 1/2 hour program itself, taking their own version of the ABC song (completely different song than what you think) and breaking it down sign by sign.  I wish they'd have such informative special features on all of their DVDs.  The early ones have barely any additional content; but the later ones do have a bit more.

All the Series One DVDs are the best tools available for teaching sign to children (and adults!).  They have a second series that most people don't know about, but we have not ventured there yet.  We might.  If it's half as good as the original, it will be worth the money.",1262908800,6,810,4.317880794701987
2200023,5,B00074OLR2,"Rachel Coleman's Signing Times series is not only educational, but very entertaining.  I got it for my two and a half year old granddaughter because she signed before she spoke.  She loves the music and wanted to watch it over and over.  Everything that I've seen in this series is great. It's a fun way to introduce pre-schoolers to signing.",1252972800,,342,4.666666666666667
2200024,4,B00074OLR2,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy the ABC signs, but since so many other signs are based on formations of the letters of the alphabet, I decided it was a good idea.  There are very clear instructions on how to make the signs and the video shows lots of clips of little ones making the signs, too.  The music is catchy and you can learn lots of other signs for words in the review songs.

My 16 month old isn't as interested in this dvd as much as he enjoys others in this series (he LOVES the animal ones), but I think he will like it more once he is older (he is signing tons of words right now.)  Overall, I like it and think it's worth buying, especially if you have older kids or just want to learn to sign the alphabet.",1234137600,,723,3.9655172413793105
2200025,5,B00074OLR2,This DVD is wonderful.  I bought this for my grandchildren ages 2 1/2 and 16 months old and they love it.  It keeps their interest almost the entire time watching. Lots of songs to keep it on a high note while learning the alphabet too.  You won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend this one.

This one goes a little too quickly for her, so she always asks for the others first.  I have been very happy with the Signing Time program. It teaches ASL to any age, especially to children of all ages.  Some of the Signing programs teach a baby version. Signing Time does not ""dumb down"" to the children.

This is by far the best series out there.  Most other products are so boring that parents must struggle to stay awake during the production, and there is no way a toddler would tolerate a viewing.  My 2-year-old twins request Signing Time all of the time.  At home they want the DVDs playing almost constantly.  In the car my hearing daughter starts asking for the Signing Time CD before I even have her strapped into her carseat.  My 2-year-old deaf daughter is using 5-sign sentences, which is almost unheard of for the deaf child of hearing parents.  My extended family owns a total of 6 sets of Signing Time.

When I had my daughter I immediately started using a few signs and found that she picked up eat and more at about 5 months. Then I found the Signing Times DVD's. I was so excited so I bought them all and started watching them with my daughter. These DVD's are the best thing I have bought for my daughter! She is 2-1/2 now and knows about 60 signs! I have never really had a problem with temper tantrums and our communication is wonderful! Plus she speaks so clearly already. I am very proud of her!

While our son is very proficient with ""milk"" and ""more,"" he hasn't demonstrated the extensive practical usage that we hoped -- we are probably to blame because we haven't been consistent as suggested on the Signing Time website.  However, an added benefit we've found is that my husband and I can use sign language when we can't communicate verbally, such as in church, when he's outside the car and I can't hear him, or when we need to be quiet.  It's a really handy second language, and with some practice, finger spelling is easy.  Also what is so enjoyable about these videos is that Rachel Coleman is an outstanding singer/songwriter, and performer -- you can learn more signs by watching her sing/sign; this adds a fun challenge!",1127174400,7,893,4.810457516339869
2200043,5,B00074OLR2,"This Signing Time video has made a great addition to our ""Children's Video Library"".  Children and adults demonstrate signs repeatedly while the word for the sign is spoken.  Words are shown in text and pictures of what the word is referring to are shown. ASL signs and short sentences are used to reinforce complete understanding. Children WILL learn from this video.  The imagery is colorful, the music is catchy, and the information presented,(ABC signs), is perfect for young ASL beginners.

The concept of accelerating my children's language development and giving them the ability to express themselves to me accurately are two reasons I was motivated to look for videos such as the Signing Time videos.  Signing Time was one of the few videos I found that specifically used ASL and focused on toddler, preschool and young aged children.  My twin 2 1/2 year old boys ask to watch them by saying to me ""want watch Alex and Leah, Moma!""  They love their Signing Time videos!",1125360000,,978,4.890909090909091

Signing Time videos by far are the most informative and fun ones yet. The songs are so catchy! and it is put together so well. The narrator is meant to make these videos. These are perfect for kids of all ages. My 4 year old (girl) LOVES IT, and my husband's 6 and 9 year old (boy and girl) LOVE IT...and can't wait to teach my 3 month old son!  I love how the DVD's have so many other options you can review...like on vol. 5 you can have Rachel go over the alphabet clearly...and much more!  I never thought of it as a 2nd language but am so glad so many people are bringing it to our attention---thanks to the Fokker's!  For small babies and toddlers it is so helpful for them to be able to tell you what they need!  Another way to communicate!  And who knows , you may use it when you least expect it!  A MUST BUY!

I wish they had the entire set for sale!",1113004800,4,996,4.020304568527918
2200046,5,B00074OLR2,"This volume needs to be in every preschool and elementary school, public library and every home video library. Since we got this one in December, my son has gone around the house and his classroom obsessed with the alphabet. He can identify, sign and say every letter, and can discriminate between upper and lower case letters. At the mall the other day, he said and signed every letter on the 'target' sign. When we sing the 'A is for Alex and Alligator' song from this volume, he adds other words to it himself, and proudly says ""W~ William!""! Not only has it helped him verbally, but he is refining his fine motor skills too! William is 4 and has Trisomy 21/aka Down syndrome. The Signing Time series has been so helpful in all areas of learning.

Signing Time is 'Superbly Terrific'! and this one is a necessity!",1111968000,10,816,4.551020408163265
2200047,5,B00074OLR2,"If you ever wanted to sign with your child but didn't think you had time to learn yourself - this is the EASY and FUN way to learn together. When we started signing with our daughter Sadie at 9 months we didn't know more than a couple. Now that she is 2, we all know over 100 signs. Now that she is talking --She uses her words AND signs to help communication her desires. It's wonderful to be able to understand the sign she uses even when the word doesn't make any sense.

Don't miss this wonderful set of DVD's!",1106956800,4,514,4.14
2200048,5,B00074OLR2,"I cannot begin to tell you how much of an impact the Signing Time videos have on my son Ethan.  He is more verbal and incredibly excited about learning something new each and every time we watch these videos.

This tape was so good even my husband is singing the songs and enjoying himself.",1105401600,,290,4.351851851851852
2200049,5,B00074OLR2,"I have all of the Signing Time DVD's... but this one is my favorite.  The reason?  Learning the ABC's REALLY makes it easier to remember OTHER SIGNS!  You get great songs and learn other signs that go with each letter (i.e. alligator, baseball bat, careful...).  The Special Features is wonderful as well as Rachel goes over all the ADDITIONAL signs that go with the alphabet!  That's a LOT OF SIGNS!

My son is 19 months old (has total hearing) and has been saying the alphabet for about 2 months now.  It took him 8 days and he is now starting to SIGN his ABC's, too!

I swear by all of this videos... the DVD's, the CD's... My son is in love with them and I love learning as he is learning!

He is now 14 months and can sign about 20 words.  All thanks to Signing Time.  It's entertaining for kids and adults (ask my 13 year old)! And it's all ASL, so we are learning a second language.  Kuddos to Signing Time!!",1104883200,,394,3.9871794871794872
2200052,5,B00074OLR2,"This DVD would be worth it's price if all you learned were the ASL signs for the alpahbet, but you get all that and more.  For each letter that you learn, Rachel teaches you 2 or 3 more signs for words that start with that letter.  You are learning at least 100 signs in this one video alone!  The music is the best part.  You can't help but sing along and you will most definately find yourself singing the songs long after the DVD is over.  The special features are priceless!  Rachel slows everything down and really shows you how to do the signs correctly.  The very best part is X for X-Ray!  I ADORE Hopkins the Frog as he travels across the X-Ray machine.  Amazing work, Signing Time, once again!",1104883200,2,703,4.305343511450381
2200053,5,B00074OLR2,"Volume 5 in the ""Signing Time"" series is absolutely wonderful for teaching children (and adults) the American Sign Language  Manual Alphabet, as well as over 50 Signs to use in your daily activities.

If you think this video is too advanced for your little ones -- think again!  Even Toddlers can learn the handshapes, what the printed letter looks like, the sounds of the letters, and a few ASL Signs for each letter of the alphabet.  There are cute kids, cute graphics, Alex and Leah are having lots of fun, and (in the usual Signing Time fashion) there are some FUN new songs that pertain to learning your ABC's!

In the song, ""A is for Alex and Alligator"" the fingerspelling is quite fast, but really fun to TRY if you are learning American Sign Language and want to get to Rachel Coleman's level of skill...  Good luck with that!!!  The ""LMNO"" song is about how some children think that 'LMNO' is just one letter, or word.  Educators are really going to love it!

There are many young children of different ages and abilities showing the handshapes, so you can see that children don't need to do the Signs perfectly.  We don't expect them to, either.  Some children just don't have the fine motor skills yet, and for some we just have to adjust to the way they are capable of making the shapes.  (This is another aspect of learning and using Sign Language, everyone has their own 'accent' and skill level.  We learn to be flexible.)

I wish this had been available a few years ago, when my son was younger!  He learned the manual alphabet at age 2, but it would have been really easy if we had this Signing Time video!

I know that many families will benefit from this useful learning tool.  Two Thumbs (or... ""Hands"") Up!!!",1104796800,5,1729,4.525806451612903
2200054,5,B00074OLR2,"I may be an adult, but these DVDs couldn't make it easier for someone like me - who learns better from a video than a book - to learn sign language. And 'Signing Time!' is FANTASTIC! The children modeling the signs are adorable, and Rachel Coleman's wonderful songs at the end help incorporate all the signs learned. I can't think of a better way to learn sign language - child OR adult - than with 'Signing Time!'",1104710400,3,414,4.3896103896103895
2200055,5,B00074OLR2,"I have been signing for 25 years and trying that long to teach my Mom the alphabet.  In ONE viewing of this Volume of Signing Time (we love them ALL) my Mom learned to sign ALL her letters!  She said ""Rachel could teach me anything! She is fabulous to watch!""  This video not only helped my little girl with her Signing alphabet, but she no longer has trouble speaking her alphabet.  Thank you Signing Time!!!",1104710400,2,409,4.413333333333333

2200057,5,B00074OLR2,"I got Volumes 1-3 right after we had my 2 1/2 yr old tested for language delays. She barely missed the cutoff for services, but we were still concerned. She only had 30 word appoximations! Well, after watching the videos for 1 week, she had picked up 15 signs with the clear spoken word to match! by the end of 5 weeks, she could speak and sign all 100 or so signs from the set! (I also have a 4 1/2 yr old who has also improved with these videos. Plus, my 7 month old daughter is often enthralled with them. She recognizes the sign for ""milk"" and gets excited when we sign it!)

My husband is Deaf, so we do use sign at home, but she refused to pick up EITHER language. These videos provided a way for her to communicate! Now she is picking up the signs/words from Vol 4-6 just as quickly, and she is stringing words and signs together.

The songs are so fun! You will be singing them even if there are no kids around! I love these videos and what they have given to my daughter!! :)

2200058,5,B00074OLR2,I studied ASL in college and was looking for a way to help my children learn a language that I have come to love.  Signing Time has been an answer.  This DVD makes learning the ABC's fun and I love the extras.,1104537600,,209,3.9523809523809526
2200059,5,B00074OLR2,"We discovered Signing Time while researching ASL (American Sign Language) as a 2nd language for our children. We knew we wanted to teach ASL as a 2nd language because of the many benefits such as earlier communication. You can communicate with your baby as young as 8 months old, maybe even younger. What a gift to know what your child needs before they can tell you with spoken words! For more information on the benefits of ASL check out the Signing Time website at [...]

What fun the songs are in this volume. The ABC songs are very catchy and show you lots of new signs. If you can only get one of the Signing Time shows I would suggest this one because it covers so much information. The entire alphabet is shown along with words for each letter. Also numbers 1-10 in ASL. This volume is currently my kid's favorite.

We love that we get to hear Leah's voice. What a positive experience for children who are Deaf and Hard Of Hearing to see another Child who is Deaf proudly using their voice. Leah does a great job. It is also great for children who are hearing to see that children who are Deaf can and do use their voices. Alex does a great job as well. We love to see the 2 friends/cousins interacting together. We also enjoyed the addition of the frog Hopkins. He helps transition from one theme to another smoothly.

One downside to this volume. While it does introduce tons of new signs not all of the words from the show are shown in sign. I know it is difficult to show every sign but we would have found it very helpful. For example B is for bubbles but they don't show the sign for bubbles. If you have a child who wants to know the sign for everything you need to do your homework for this volume. I have made a list of the words that are discussed in this volume but don't have a sign in the show. Many of the words are shown in other volumes of Signing Time and I have marked them with a * the rest are not shown in any of the volumes so you may want to look them up. Also a slide and a horse are shown. They do not say the word or show the sign. My 2 year old saw them though and wanted to know those signs as well so you may want to look them up also.

One other thing that may be confusing for some younger kids is some of the word choices. For example O is for organ. Many kids are not familiar with this instrument so you may find your younger ones arguing with you that O is for piano, Q is for blanket (quilt), N is for paper (newspaper), V is for car (van), and K is for ball (kick).

We like that the written word comes on the screen first and then they show the sign. It is very helpful for practicing the signs. It is like a video flashcard. It also helps children develop reading skills because they start to recognize the written word that goes with the sign. We love watching the children do the signs because you see lots of different kids and lots of different skill levels. It gives you an idea of how your child might make the sign at different ages. Rachel also does the sign so you can clearly see the proper way to do it. She has paint on her fingers to help you focus on her finger positions. This is a new addition for Volumes 3-6. Some people find it distracting at first but I found it very helpful.

The song during the credits is a great way to learn additional signs that were not covered in the show. You can really add to your signing vocabulary if you pay attention. The new version of the theme song is a little slower (so you can sign along) and has an additional verse. Some may not like it as well as the original but we loved it. We love the original version too so make sure you get both. The older version is in Volumes 1-3. We liked the new verse ""Where friends can meet and find we're not so different after all"" Isn't that what Signing Time is all about?

I highly recommend this volume of signing time as well as the other 5 in the series. As a mother and a teacher I can say it is truly the best educational tool I have found for teaching ASL to children (and adults too). I hope they make many more and I will buy them all without hesitation. These shows are a labor of love for these families and we are thankful they chose to share with us.",1104537600,5,4453,4.168421052631579

Volume 5 is all about ABCs.  It teaches the ASL alphabet as well as some signs for each letter.  I am absolutely amazed that my 21 month old has learned some of the ABC signs in the few times she's watched this already!

Signing Time is a great way to introduce children to a second language, ASL.  It is also the perfect way for babies to communicate before they develop speech.  I can't count the times we've prevented a temper tantrum!  These videos have really given my daughter confidence because she knows she can use signs to tell us what she wants, even when she does not know the word or cannot yet speak it clearly.  The second 3 volumes have helped expand our signing vocabulary and really allow us to use ASL more and more.",1104364800,,854,4.388535031847134

Each DVD has a section on the menu of ASL tips. This is a good way to get additional information.

Many people have questions about name signs so this is a very helpful section

My daughter was able to recognize the alphabet by 13 months, and also simultaneously say and sign ""B"" at this age whenever she saw Rachel signing ""B"". I am sure that it was this DVD which inspired our daughter to again simultaneously speak and sign ""W"" when she saw the FBI WARNING at the beginning of this DVD.

The menu options are simple, the length and pace of the main feature are very suitable, and the music...well it is very catchy and has been quite an earwig in our lives.

I am writing this review many years later - our daughter is now six. She had attained third grade reading level by halfway through kindergarten, and I am sure that this DVD contributed to it.
