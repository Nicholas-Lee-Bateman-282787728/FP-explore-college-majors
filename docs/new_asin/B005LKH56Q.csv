4829134,3,B005LKH56Q,"Uninhabited is a slow-burning horror film that follows a young couple that decide to spend their holiday in an uninhabited island. Their peaceful vacation is interrupted when they find mysterious footprints, things are mysteriously moved/misplaced, and when they find a deserted cabin.

First, you should know this is a slow horror film. It doesn't only work off of jump-out scares and it doesn't throw them at the audience often. Instead, it works off of tension and a slow build up. I personally love slow-burners, but Uninhabited doesn't really work efficiently as a slow burner; I mean, it has some very tense and creepy moments, but they didn't really lead to anything truly scary. I did like the idea of a haunted island, I thought it was very interesting and slightly innovative. Also, the film has great music and is shot beautifully. Acting was decent, nothing special but not terrible either; I should note, some of the dialogue felt very forced and unrealistic. The ending was also okay, could've been better.

Overall, Uninhabited is a decent film. If you're looking for something petrifying, this is not it. But if you enjoy slow-burners, you may enjoy this one. As of 9/16/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, and I recommend a rental before a purchase.

Uninhabited has some strong blood and violence, and some very brief nudity.",1347753600,3,1356,4.991150442477876
4829135,1,B005LKH56Q,"I literally started thinking of other things to do while I was watching this. After the first 30 minutes, I was hoping something was about to happen. Nothing really did. The scenery is good, and the elements look great, but the movie itself is just boring. Even the ending was dumb. Two people talking and a few unusual things happen. Thats about it. If you're looking for a good horror movie, this isn't it.",1347667200,,408,4.527027027027027
4829136,3,B005LKH56Q,"For being a straight-to-DVD movie, Uninhabited is surprisingly excellent when it comes to the cinematography. Otherwise, it's a pretty standard haunting flick, just with a different setting than other ghost movies.  Uninhabited is about an attractive young couple that take a vacation to a deserted coral island on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. But it isn't long before Harry and Beth discover that they may not be alone.

Despite this being a low-budget movie shot with a skeleton crew, the visuals really stand out. The footage of the Queensland, Australia beach is beautiful, and makes for an interesting setting to a ghost movie. Uninhabited marks Aussie director Bill Bennett's first return to shooting a feature film in over eight years. So it's refreshing to see this quality of directing for a simple horror flick.

The bad news is that the concept of the film isn't incredibly original. While most haunting movies don't take place on a deserted island, the general plot ideas come off as familiar. The first half of the film, there's a genuine feeling of suspense as you try to figure out what is actually happening to the couple, and why. But there's a bit of an easy cop-out as to how the audience discovers the island's secret, and by that point, the suspense sort of fizzles out.

Uninhabited was billed as being ""inspired by a real-life incident,"" which is pretty vague. Only after some digging was I able to find out that writer/director Bill Bennett had a fearful experience when staying at a similar deserted island with his brother and their girlfriends years ago. Bennett never goes into detail about what happened, but cryptically states that there was someone or something on the island with them. So it's a bit misleading that any of the more dangerous elements of Uninhabited had ever occurred in real life.

Despite being a newbie actress when this film was shot, the beautiful Geraldine Hakewill offers a surprisingly good performance as Beth.  The same can't be said for actor Henry James, which isn't a surprise considering Uninhabited was his first and only feature film to date.  He comes off as a surfer that was cast only because of his looks, which unfortunately hurts the film overall.

If you're a diehard fan of supernatural horror movies, especially those with a revenge theme, Uninhabited is worth renting or watching online. Just don't expect Gothika, or The Grudge. It's a slow-burning movie, so if prefer a fast-paced horror flick, Uninhabited isn't for you. I'd say give this one a watch first, before you consider actually buying the DVD.",1346457600,5,2587,4.944700460829493
8478193,4,B005LKH56Q,"This isn't bad for a low budget movie, it's a pretty good idea.  Just find a small island with a bit of overgrown folliage in the middle, base two good looking people on it and revolve a story about them slowly realising they are not alone on the island like they thought they would be, make each piece of further evidence a bit more creepy making them more and more annoyed and determined to find their unwanted neighbour then ensure they have no means of escape when the likelihood of death reveals itself.

The camera filming at the start was a bit obvious there was a camera man there when they were trying to sell the fact this island has no one else on it other than the two characters.  They'd run past it, then it would rotate taking in scenery panning right to left, then left to right.  I found the movie to be quite good for the first part, it's slow but that fits in with being a marine biologist on an island where your boyfriend has tagged along.  You and more so he doesn't have much to do so your going to be lazily moving around slowly and in no rush.  Unfortunately this is a movie that lets you know its going to be using something later in the film.  So ultimately the ending became very weak because you knew it was coming.  But even with these faults, Uninhabited is a nice slow paced thriller.  Beth the marine biologist is played by Geraldine Hakewill, best known for playing one of the two lead characters in the mini series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wanted/dp/B01FR34URI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wanted</a>.

8478195,3,B005LKH56Q,"I wanted to give it more stars, but the plot is such a let down, so is Harry's acting. The scenery is stunning though.

Uninhabited is about a couple, who has a vacation/research-cation, on an island that is supposed to be empty.  It's basically horrible to sit through for the first 15 or so minutes, with the on and off making out sessions that have way too much audio (i don't want to hear saliva... ), no nudity though.  So things start to get weird when they noticed foot prints that don't belong to them, and realize their stuff is being moved.
Don't expect a jump scare movie, or really anything special, it kind of sinks, a lot....the acting is a let down, the ending is a let down, more questions than answers but you don't really care at the same time.
(partial spoilers for content warnings)
Not too much violence or gore is shown, more implied, Talk about graphic sexual assault (none is shown, which i am thankful for), however there is some very disturbing assault audio. a naked male butt is shown for a moment .

*spoilery review*
While i think Coral had every single right to be angry and want to seek revenge, i feel like we rarely got to see her on her revenge question, i feel like the ending was so out of place, because it seems like a certain character wouldn't really have motivation to continue on the work of coral? maybe it's just me.",1462492800,,1361,4.410358565737051

8478198,2,B005LKH56Q,"Last night we watched 'Uninhabited'. It's the story of a young couple that camp out on a small island near the Great Barrier Reef. They are dropped off there by a small boat that would come back to pick them up in 10 days. They have all the supplies they need and a tent. The island is supposed to be uninhabited so they would be alone and have a romantic getaway. After the first day or so they come to realize they're not alone. The movie contains some nice tropical scenic photography, unfortunately the story drags out and was ultimately a waste of time. I'll rate it a 2 out of 5 stars for the pretty scenery.",1398988800,,614,4.256410256410256
8478199,3,B005LKH56Q,"Im always suspicious of a movie that claims to be based on or inspired by actual events.  I know right away that the movie Im about to watch could be anywhere from about 90% true all the way down to 1% true.

For example, in the movie THE CONJURING, do I believe there was a presence in that house?  I do.  Do I believe that presence possessed the mother, made her chair float into the air, turn upside down, and result in anything even remotely resembling the climax of that movie?  Not even a little bit, do I believe that.

In the movie THE PERFECT STORM, with Clooney and Wahlberg, do I believe a boat sank during a storm?  Yep.  Do I believe ANY of the events that occurred on that boat, as depicted in the movie, once it left harbor were accurate?  Not one bit.  There were no survivors, so everything in the second and third acts of that movie are entirely made up.

Which leads us to Bill Bennetts 2010 movie UNINHABITED.  This is the story of young lovers Beth (Gerladine Hakewill, WASTED ON THE YOUNG) and Harry (Henry James, no other credits), on holiday for 10 days off the Great Barrier Reef of Australia.  They have an entire island to themselves.  They do a few things that have four letters and start with F, fish being one of those things, and they generally have a grand time.  For about a day.

Then they start to hear weird noises in the jungle.  They start to see strange footprints in the sand.  Someone hangs all of Beths underwear, even the leopard print ones, in a tree outside their tent.  Theyre sure they're not alone, so they explore more of the island and come upon a small shack not far from their camp.

They also spot a couple of Russian poachers off the island, shooting sharks with a rifle.

Beth decides shes ready to leave early, but the satellite phone is missing.  The Russians took it, Harry decides.  They head over there, demand it back, but are soon captured by the two angry men.  Before the dirty one can further violate Beth, the hairier one calls his partner over to help him investigate noises in the woods.  Soon the two are running back to their boat, the dirty one bleeding, and Beth and Harry escape back to their own camp.

Something is definitely on the island with them.  But when they head back to the shack the next day and Beth thinks shes discovered the secret, Harry wants no part of it, and refuses to see all the signs.

UNINHABITED definitely plays it close and keeps a lot of its secrets hidden until the perfect time, leading the viewer, at first, to believe the poachers are the big danger on the island.  That would have been terrible, especially to have two unreasonable and vicious dudes like that coming after you, with no way off the island for another week.  But then, to find the truth is much worse and that, if history is any indication, there is absolutely NOTHING you can do to stop it, thats even worse.  Hell, with the Russians, you can say take the girl, just don't hurt me--I kid, I kid--but the thing on the island, if its real (and Harry hopes its not), theres no reasoning, no compromise, and no escape.

UNINHABITED wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't terrible.

I think it was FULL of clichs, like the Russian poachers, the mysterious diary they find in the shack that just conveniently tells the history of the place, the videotaped scenes of Beth and Harry sleeping in their tent, the way too obvious early don't step on that, its deadly scene which you don't have to be Roger Ebert to know is going to come into play again before the end of the movie.

I mean, it felt like Bennett just had a checklist of all the things a movie like this was supposed to include, and he made sure to use them all.

On the other hand, clichs aside, I thought it was well-shot.  One shot of Harry finding a cell phone in the shack was particularly effective.

The acting was 50/50 for me.  Beth and Harry are the only two characters who get any serious screen time, and for the length of the movie, I believed Beth and was annoyed by Harry.  For several reasons.  First, it sounded like Harrys every line was dubbed in later.  I know ADR is a part of the process and its used in every movie, but something about the quality of Harrys lines didn't match Beths, which made everything he said sound like it was added in later.  Second, there was a believability missing from Harrys delivery.  Beth seemed to be enjoying herself, then she seemed to be scared.  Harry seemed to be trying to make sure he hit his mark and got his lines right.  I just didn't buy it.

And the final thing that made the movie only partially work for me was, it just wasn't very exciting.  Bennett shot a beautiful movie, and he keeps the eye engaged at all times.  But the pace he establishes for the action is too slow.  In the whole 88 minutes, there were maybe two tense scene: the capture by the Russians, and the scene with the cell phone.  Everything else came and went, but none of it was really designed to raise your blood pressure.  It was pretty, sure, but it was also pretty dull for the most part.

The ending was telegraphed within the first ten minutes of the movie, and I hated being right when it happened.  Overall, UNINHABITED is okay at best.  It doesnt make me want to track down more Bennett movies, nor does it intrigue me enough to delve into the backstory and find out just what news article the movie was based on.  Honestly, theres every possibility it was based on something so simple as Couple Goes on Holiday, Wife Stubs Toe.

Im glad I got to see it as it makes me definitely want to visit the Great Barrier Reefs.  But as a movie, as a story, it didn't excite me at all.",1393200000,,5648,4.361457334611697
8478200,5,B005LKH56Q,"I loved this movie.  Nothing really graphic.  A few F words by the guy with a gag on his mouth, but mostly just a uniquely interesting horror film.  I've never seen anything quite like it.  The only part that confuses me is why the ""ghost"" goes after Geraldine Hakewell in the end.  A slight bit slow at times, but I enjoy this type of movie.  I have patience.  Still a movie I would recommend to all horror fans.",1360627200,,413,4.217948717948718
8478201,2,B005LKH56Q,"Beth is a skinny girl who doesn't need to cover her face in make-up to be cute. She's on a beautiful island. Those are the good parts. Everything else about this modern-day ghost story is either downright bad or just plain boring. Actually, there's a somewhat intense scene in which she's tied to a big rock, probably about to be raped by two guys, but it doesn't last long because there's a scarier villain lurking near-by. But who cares. And that's the problem. I don't. The only other protagonist is her boyfriend, the only other person she thought she was on the island with, hence the title, but he's of little interest. He does, however, seem to be the main focus of attention for the ghost; the back-story of which, like dead people being able to work video cameras, makes no sense.

The way they made the movie was real enough to believe yet scary enough to keep you on the edge of your seat! I would recommend it to all my family and friends both male and female!,1353974400,,319,3.8484848484848486
