1647539,1,B00005QCY5,"I bought this set based on the great reviews it got on this site. I reviewed the Fire tape and tried the Earth tape and I don't understand why anyone would recommend this series, particularly to a beginner.
I admit I've been doing yoga for only 10 months, but I take a class at a yoga studio, taught by people who have actually studied in India. I bought these tapes to use for the days when I don't go to the studio. After trying them I don't believe they are worth my time. I would rather practice ad hoc.
The tapes put me off right from the start when the speaker did not use the names I was expecting for postures. For example, calling Child's Pose 'embryo pose'. Or instead of going into Prayer Pose, 'go into Namaste'. I didn't expect the Sanskrit names but I also didn't expect this lingo.
More important, I did not find the instructions detailed enough to protect a beginner from injury. For example, I don't recall that it was really emphasized strongly that the pubic bone should be pressed against the floor during Cobra (or was it Upward-Facing Dog?) and not doing this can definitaly hurt the lower back. I have to watch this in my own practice which is why I was quick to notice it. Also, I don't believe that the postures were held long enough to give a novice enough instruction to get a sense of how the posture should feel if it is being done properly. This could also lead to injury. And overall, after doing the Earth tape I felt dissatisfied with the practice, as if I had done the lunges on only one leg - didn't feel balanced.
So I would suggest, if you want to go with the great reviews, buy the tapes. But do not use them as a substitute for good in-person training at a class. In fact, spend a few months in class before trying the videos. And then if you are disappointed like I was, return them.
Amazon was great about giving me a refund.
Namaste!",1032134400,8,1875,4.314447592067989
1647540,3,B00005QCY5,"The tape packaging and several of the reviews said this set was good for beginners, but beware!  I am a REAL beginner (i.e. I don't know any of the poses at all) and this tape doesn't actually explain the poses; it just jumps right in.  After trying the first tape once, I went out and bought Yoga for Dummies to learn the basics first.
I think I will probably come to love and regularly use this set.  I love the tranquil setting and gentle instruction by Tracey and Ganga; it will just take me a little time to work up to this set.
Bottom line: if you're a real beginner like me, start with a *teaching* video, like Yoga for Dummies, to learn the poses.  Then work your way up.
Namaste!",1027555200,8,688,4.229007633587786
1647541,5,B00005QCY5,"I consider myself an advanced beginner and have been practicing 3 times a week for the last year or so.  I found this series to be great.  The first two tapes are more for beginners and I like how at the beginning of each tape, they took the time to teach you the most important thing about yoga which is ujayii breathing.  Most other tapes or even classes hardly spend the time telling u how to breathe which can affect your entire yoga experience.
As an advanced beginner, I only watched the first tape and did the second tape once.  After that, I only practiced with the 3rd tape which is a more challenging hatha vinyassa yoga practice lasting a bit over 60 minutes.  I disagree with one of the other reviewers saying that it's all about repetitions and nothing new.  That's what vinyassa yoga is... lots of sun salutations one after another to get your body warm and to control your breathing well throughout the entire exercise!
I don't know what others expect.  The poses in yoga practices are limited in the sense that you cannot really invent a new pose!  But variations of each poses are limitless depending on the capability of your body.  Plus, I have often done research with books on more advanced variations of certain poses and integrate them into this workout.  Furthermore, as the tape demonstrates, while Rich is doing a simpler pose, Ganga will do a more challenging pose.  This has helped me tremendously on setting goals.
Compared to the routines by Rodney Yee, I believe the narration is much better as Rich clearly tells u how to coordinate your breathing with your poses to maximize the effects of yoga.  Compared to Power Yoga with Bryan Kest, this series seem more ""traditional"" and is a bit less ""fun.""  Nevertheless, it is still quite challenging.  I intermix Power Yoga - Sweat with Fire from this series for my in home practices and go to the yoga classes for additional inspirations and learnings.
As a beginner, I think you should get the whole set as the first two are invaluable in terms of teaching and poses.  When you gets better, u can move on to the third tape and maybe give the first two tapes to friends and family to inspire them!  Otherwise, just get Fire from this series and the last 2 tapes from Bryan Kest's series to have a challenging yoga experience!  Namaste!",1023840000,43,2312,4.6
1647542,5,B00005QCY5,"I've been doing Yoga about a year.  I love this set!  The first, Earth, is abut 30 minutes and teaches flowing yoga and basic poses.  The second, Water, adds more poses, different transitions and takes it a step farther in about 45 minutes.  The third, Fire, is an hour and a very challenging workout--I still have difficulty with it but it gives me a great goal to work towards.  The photography is beautiful, the instruction detailed and clear and the tapes are actual workout practices instead of an instructor just showing what he or she can do and talking a lot.  Go for it!",1021161600,7,579,4.519230769230769
1647543,5,B00005QCY5,"Having nearly worn out Total Yoga (the first tape), I was delighted to find these available.  This is the real stuff, no strange beachy or desert settings or other strange stuff.  The Earth tape is ideal for beginners, or  me on a lazy day -- loved it and I could do it all.  The Water tape was more of a challenge, but still could do most of it.  The Fire tape is still okay, much more aerobic, and the poses I can't do, I don't do -- just substitute something else.  These people can teach!  My only problem is me -- I just can't bend totally in half, but I'm 56 and doing all that I can.",1011744000,19,590,3.9914529914529915
1647544,5,B00005QCY5,"This series is the penultimate of Yoga instruction.
You can skip the others--- these people actually teach in a way anyone can understand and practice.  This is the real stuff- not the trendy look at me Yoga.  I can't wait for more.",1008115200,17,232,4.5
7950221,3,B00005QCY5,It's a VHS so the picture quality is not that great.  My Earth VHS is defective. The screen just bounces.,1445558400,,105,4.25
7950222,5,B00005QCY5,"This is a must have for all yogi's!!!  Features water, earth and fire with fire being the more difficult and water being a more beginner like practice.  I have been teaching yoga for many years, but this series remains my fave",1408838400,,226,4.487804878048781
7950223,5,B00005QCY5,"This is the absolute best Yoga instructional series. It is easy to folow but challenging at the same time. I found the Earth tape to be alittle too slow, but I recommend it for those who are extreme couch potatoes, or overweight, however it is a great beginner instruction manual. I would recommend skipping straight to Water if you are already in decent shape or have some experience with yoga or pilates. Fire will kick your butt, which makes it very challenging after you have mastered the Water tape, but it is still do-able. All in all I like these videos because of the complete instructions, and the variations shown by using the 2 yoga instructors, also they show the whole body, and proper positioning throughout the series unlike some videos that continually zoom in on the teachers face for effect. The first week with these tapes I noticed a a great difference in my flexability, and muscle tone, after a month I could do things with my body I haven't done since middle school. I recommend this series for anyone who wants to learn some real Yoga and be challenged.",1157587200,2,1077,4.643979057591623
7950224,5,B00005QCY5,"i really enjoy the three workouts. water is the one i practice with most, since i like the pace. the instruction is very good, and gives you enough time to work through the poses without feeling rushed. this set is great for anyone who wants to develop a yoga practice, from new beginner to advanced ability.",1126483200,2,308,4.517857142857143
7950225,5,B00005QCY5,"I bought this video because I couldn't find a hatha or vinyasa flow class in my community and wanted a solid, flexible practice to do at home.  I love it for two reasons:
1) The increasing challenges of the Earth, Water and Fire sequences let me vary my practice.  So far I have tried Water and Fire, and even though a few of the Fire poses are beyond me, I could modify them and still get a great workout.
2) I found many other yoga videos to be too introductory or not a real flow session.  Total Yoga - The Flow Series really provides an everyday workout -- for days when you feel weak or strong.  I have also been turned off by videos narrated in overly dreamy, otherworldly voices.  Total Yoga includes no-nonsense narration that focuses on posture, focus and safety.
Highly recommended!",1083715200,8,792,4.472222222222222
7950226,2,B00005QCY5,"The level of detail in the instuction varies widely; some asanas are almost painfully dissected, others seemingly glossed over. Also, instruction is delivered in a very serious-sounding monotone. I would recommend the Yoga Zone tapes over these.",1060560000,3,245,5.648648648648648
7950227,5,B00005QCY5,"I really like these tapes.  The first one is pretty easy, but it is very relaxing, and i use it on days when I want to take it easy.  The second one is somewhat challenging, and the third one is even more so.  These tapes are a great guide from a beginning level to a more advanced one.  Tracy Rich is a very good instructor and makes you feel comfortable.  I also like how they (Ganga White and Tracy) show different versions of the poses with one being more advanced.",1051315200,2,469,4.166666666666667
7950228,5,B00005QCY5,The tapes are easy to follow. The work outs are fun. The first tape starts out very basic and then the work out intensity progresses with each tape respectively. Its a great program over all.,1046563200,5,191,4.485714285714286
7950229,4,B00005QCY5,"I own nearly 20 yoga videos, and recently added this to my collection. I love all three, but especially Water and Earth, and they are now the tapes I use most often. The best word I can use to describe them is ""pure"". This is simple yoga, no music, no seaside scenery, no ""get some rapport with the floor"" annoying rhyming. They are the perfect length for a squeezed-in yoga session (35-40 minutes), and revitalize and re-centre me even when I am very tired at the end of the day. A good investment.",1035072000,14,499,4.376344086021505
