3487853,1,B001BBAVPQ,"I saw this as a teen and found it very upsetting. Please take my advice and do not fill your head with this garbage! This film exploits death, reducing it to entertainment, and in doing so demeans the audience. Don't give your money to these people!",1336521600,4,249,4.434782608695652

3487855,5,B001BBAVPQ,"First of all, I am a female. Not only guys look for stuff like this. I, too, watched this, as a young, naive girl. Huddled up with girls at a slumber party...thinking of the WORST thing we could watch. It is a classic, cult or otherwise. A reminder of a time when freedoms were celebrated, not policed. When individuality stood for something. At time, when we were not berated or ostracized for quirky (or outlandish) interests. Quit judging!!! To each his (or her) own!! Find something more productive to do than criticize those who have different interests than your own. Gain some tolerance, why dontcha!?!? And get a little happiness while you're at it!!!!",1306886400,21,660,4.798245614035087
3487856,3,B001BBAVPQ,"This video was a big deal and very taboo back when I was in High School(the 80's). I was able to see it before ""they"" made it disappear. I bought it to show the next generation what we 80's weirdos liked. It made for an interesting evening!",1264896000,,240,4.127659574468085
3487857,4,B001BBAVPQ,"A film like FOD deserves to have a special release for it's 30th anniversary. I think this release will spark a lot of new comers to the film. Because of this, I think it is important to view this film completely within the context of when it was made. This hardly seems shocking in 2009 and we also now know much of it was faked. However, the way in which it was faked is pure genious. The way they were able to match film stocks, exposure and shooting style for each individual scene is really quite remarkable. Sure, you can tell now that some of the famous scenes are not real, but it is still hard to tell which shots are original and which are recreated within each individual scene.

The overall transfer is very good looking. It was also released on Blu-Ray but I really can't imagine that it looks so much better than this version. The special features are very nice. Special segments from the FX team and the editor are very interesting to watch. The audio commentary is also very good.

Anyway, nice treatment to such a classic and noteworthy film.",1250553600,23,1059,4.453608247422681
3487858,4,B001BBAVPQ,"Well we had heard about this movie through a friend of ours...He told us that you see people beign murdered, committing suicide, etc etc.  We believed it was a true story, and that there was no acting.  So we were very disappointed to see the special features, on how they created the scenes!",1232928000,,292,4.490566037735849
3487859,2,B001BBAVPQ,"As i knew the UNCUT version of this from my Danish tape i was disusted to see that this ""30TH ANNIVERSARY edition"" was missing a scene that lasts about 4 minutes !!
Would have thought that they released it uncut when going through the trobles of making a ""3oth Anniversay""....",1231200000,4,276,4.54
3487860,5,B001BBAVPQ,"Here's a true shockumentuary. Its been 30 years, and this film is still strong. Faces of death is the first film that shows real death. Yeah I know that some scenes are fake. But still this movie inspired alot of hardcore movie goers. FOD was one of the first death films in theaters nationwide. I remeber rented FOD at the video store years back. Some scenes were pretty gross. But still I'm glad to see a special edition being release. Finally this movie is getting the respest it deserves. Love the new cover.",1219449600,3,512,4.516129032258065

3487868,5,B001BBAVPQ,"Well if you're looking for gore, you found it. In the DVD special features, some truths are revealed about this movie, it still doesn't make it any easier to watch. I have been watching horror films since I was 5 and I have a strong stomach, but some of the scenes in this movie were a bid hard to watch without cringing. There was only one part where I cried because it hit home. If you think you can handle it, go for it.",1427587200,2,423,4.0476190476190474

3487884,4,B001BBAVPQ,"I remember watching this on VHS many years ago.  It's a bit dated for today's fast moving device toting crowd. It wasn't as gory as I remembered. or maybe I've just seen too many gory films since! It managed to keep my interest to the end so that's a good thing. Watching it this time, I could tell there were a few scenes that seemed faked. (The monkey in particular) Fake or not, it is still a very good documentary on a once taboo subject.",1403827200,,442,4.2

3487886,5,B001BBAVPQ,"This is the one to get, just one thing, why the people making the film at the time did not stop and have ""Dr."" F. B. Gross not have his glasses not crooked on his face in the intro seems stupid and silly, they could have (should have) had him readjust them and it makes him look a bit stupid (and UN-professional) but other then that, it's a great BIO of the 70s, if only we knew where ""Dr."" F.B.

3487889,4,B001BBAVPQ,"The movie was well put together, but it was definitely the sickest movie I've ever seen! It's definitely not a movie for children and most adults to see. I skipped through some parts of the movie that were too messed up for me.

But I think that anyone that's thinking about becoming a coroner/mortician/law enforcement/EMT should see it. I think it should be watched more in an educational way, instead of as entertainment like most movies.",1380499200,,441,4.802631578947368

3487893,5,B001BBAVPQ,Loved the movies growing up. Now love them even more they are on DVD. Even the bonus features are awesome. They tell you which cases where real and which ones they did and how they did it. Even the price is unbeatable.,1368403200,,218,4.214285714285714

3487895,3,B001BBAVPQ,"In the year of our lord 2013, there are only 26 reviews for this classic piece of trash. Blasphemy.

Faces of Death, you have heard of it in some form. Maybe through those panic-fest newspaper articles from the 1980s or more recent coverage relating to the amount of the film that has been faked. For those who don't know, this is the film that supposedly contains all real death footage captured on camera. Face it (no pun intended),this film is a rite of passage. There really two types of people in the world, those who are clueless and the rest of us cynical, jaded folks who have seen Faces of Death.

The premise of this film is that it documents one man's journey to seek and understand the many faces of death. No credible reason is given for this personal journey, meaning the viewer can engage in transference and substitute their own reasons for wanting to see this film. This is a brilliant ploy on the part of the film-makers as it allows the audience to achieve an unparalleled sense of empathy with the host and - okay so I'm full of it, sue me.

This film was one of the first that offered viewers a chance to vicariously view the ultimate misfortune of others. Whether it was the man who was mauled by the bear, the guy who got the electric chair or the man who entered into a shoot-out with the police (to name a few). The host attempts to shoehorn these scenes into a linear narrative, with limited results.

Being a first-mover of sorts, this film continues to hold a degree of notoriety even in the age of ubiquitous death footage on the internet. However, as other reviewers have stated, this approach has been followed time and again and without the large amount of staged and faked footage, which will put off some viewers. Don't get me wrong, there is still plenty of real accident footage included in this film, which means it may not be suitable children's programming.

The audio and video of the DVD are imperfect, which actually enhances the viewing experience; you actually feel like you are watching an old VHS dub on the sly in your uncle's basement.  The DVD includes a 'making-of' retrospective interview, which includes some informative background information.  But really, you would be buying this DVD for the film and not the technical specs or special features.

I don't really need to recommend this film. If you are looking at these reviews, you have either seen the film or are curious to do so. My advice - go ahead, it won't bite you.",1365292800,8,2478,4.577878103837472
3487896,3,B001BBAVPQ,VERY ORIGINAL DVD BUT VERY CRAZY BUT EDUCATIONAL. I HAVE NEVER CEEN THAT DVD BEFORE SO IT WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME. I HAVE CEEN OTHER FACES OF DEATH DVDS AND ENJOYED THEM.,1364428800,,174,4.147058823529412
3487897,3,B001BBAVPQ,This movie is one that has not stood the test of time particularly in todays age with the internet and youtube. According to the producer 40% of the film is fake. I must say though that the special effects in the fake sequences were extremely well done. When I was watching the movie I could not tell which scenes were fake and which ones were real.,1359244800,,349,4.303030303030303
3487898,2,B001BBAVPQ,I was really excited to finally get this video and it's completely fake. I feel like I got gyped. I realize this video has been out quite a while but I guess I've been living under a rock and didn't know it was fake.

3487899,5,B001BBAVPQ,"You cannot beat the 80s horror movies, not only they are scary but they are also very funny. ""Excellent"" A+++++++++++",1345420800,2,117,4.9
3487900,5,B001BBAVPQ,"Faces of death the most forbidden film of the 80's youth. I was in 5th grade when I saw this for the first time. Often this film was talked about on the playground,bragging to one another about eating and watching it. Making up details that weren't even in the movie to other kids which had yet to see it. They would tell their parents.
 Some people a pissed to find out after all these years it was all a hoax. (I figured out some of it was fake years before the DVD) I think it makes it even better that in the end theirs such a weird funny story of how this classic shock film was created.
 Anyways what's making me even write this review that I doubt will ever be read is. Another review said "" what do you think people will think of you owning this DVD."" All I could think as after reading that is. What would people think not seeing this in my DVD collection. I bought it right then.
