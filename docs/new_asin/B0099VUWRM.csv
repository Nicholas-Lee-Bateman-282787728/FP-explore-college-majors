8538185,3,B0099VUWRM,"THE RED HEADED CORPSE stars Farley Granger (STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, THE PROWLER) as a drunken painter who, after watching a group of free-loving hippies, is given a female mannequin to take home (!!). At first, it's just a mannequin w/ a red wig. The painter fixes the broken parts of its face, paints features on it, and starts talking to it... a lot! We get the impression that this guy is either extremely lonely, or has slipped several gears! Perhaps both. Soon, through some magic, or mental illness, the mannequin becomes a living woman. At first, she's mute, and waits all day for him to return home for dinner and champagne. Then, she begins talking, and we see that she's transformed into Erica Blanc (THE DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE)! She's also become quite demanding, and insists that he paint her naked. Alas, now the woman starts to feel a little lonely herself, and decides to share herself w/ other men. This causes suspicion, jealousy, and death (um, sort of). THE RED HEADED CORPSE is a very strange movie. It's sort of like BABA YAGA in its weirdness. While Granger spends much of his screen time looking stunned, Ms. Blanc has never looked better! Odd but fun...",1373932800,3,1170,4.712195121951219
