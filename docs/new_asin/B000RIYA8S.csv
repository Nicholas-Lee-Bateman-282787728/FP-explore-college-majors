8200936,1,B000RIYA8S,"Ordered this recently and much to my surprise when I opened the package it was a very obvious bootleg, the cover art looks to have been made with a hope printer. Not even opening to see what the quality is as I know it will be s***, return process started.",1382140800,7,256,4.14
8200937,5,B000RIYA8S,"I was very pleased with the product, my son looked high and low for exactly this box set.  It came quickly and was in great condition.",1302307200,,134,4.153846153846154
8200938,5,B000RIYA8S,"What can I say that has not already been said about Evangelion? You get the Death and Rebirth DVD which is basically a recap of the series, plus The End of Evangelion. Their are mixed reviews for the End of Evangelion. People either love it or hate it, I thought it was good, although some of the sound effects were a little comical. Would I buy it again, yep, without a moment's hesitation.",1251504000,2,391,4.36986301369863
8200939,2,B000RIYA8S,"I write this as a warning for all those who like their anime in a quality.  As tantalizing as this ""box set"" may seem it is in fact, a bootleg or a crappy import.  The overall video transfer, especially on EoE, is grainy and the sound quiet.  The features and scene selection are just plain awful and it is obvious that it was done with little or no thought and the ending of EoE cuts out well before the final scene is over.  Don't make the mistake of buying this as I did (off of Ebay), you're best bet if you want a decent format for the Eva movies then you might as well go with Manga Entertainment's releases.",1239753600,20,614,4.1344537815126055
8200940,5,B000RIYA8S,"If you've seen the show then you have to see ending.  Brutal, intense, and psychotic are just some of my choice words to describe this movie, a must see for any evangelion fan.",1204675200,3,176,4.333333333333333
