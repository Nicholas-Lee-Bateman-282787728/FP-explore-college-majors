932812,4,6304819579,"Liked well enough to order a second copy as my first one was a different company and color inferior. All of cast give fine preformance on a story of carnival life.  Anne Baxter is down and out and Steve Cochran ,the bad guy carnival employee  offers Baxter job with carnival.  Anne runs into one problem after another ,but overcomes them all by the end of the film.  The story never drags and holds your interest and gives you a glimpse of the seedier side of carnival life.",985478400,5,474,4.413793103448276

932900,5,6304819579,I'll not argue with the 4 other reviews.  This is a great movie with a great cast giving some of their best performances.  I don't believe I've ever seen Anne Baxter any better.,1421539200,,177,4.333333333333333

932902,5,6304819579,"One of the best Anne Baxter performances.  Becoming a member of a carnival on tour in Germany, luminous blonde Baxter's German pickpocket is not a thief by profession, she's hungry.  Carnival charmer Steve Cochran catches her with his wallet, offers her a job, and as soon as she's nonchalantly showered off (with him watching), he picks her up and carries her off for some apparently addictive sex.  There's a defiance and determination to this young woman, she works hard, catches the eye of the intensely direct high dive artist who trains her and elevates her status.  There's sexual chemistry, mutual admiration, jealousy, betrayal, murder, a cat-fight, sexy swimwear, and a great group of carnies in this movie.  Baxter is convincing.  The costumes are great, the atmosphere is right, the pacing is fast and doesn't linger too long on any one situation.  I will be looking for more films directed by Kurt Neumann.",1411084800,,919,5.006578947368421

932905,5,6304819579,"Excellent DigicomTV restoration of a 50's classic movie. Not only is the film enjoyable, but the audio and video quality have been masterfully restored!

Carnival Story stars Anne Baxter as a wayward lass who joins a travelling carnival troupe. She falls in love with carny Steve Cochran, and out-and-out louse who treats Baxter like dirt and makes her like it. Eventually, she rises to star status through the auspices of high-diver Lyle Bettger, but she can never get over her passion for Cochran. Inevitably, this romantic triangle degenerates into violence, leaving magazine photographer George Nader to pick up the pieces. Lots of drama, fist-fights, face slapping, strangling, skimpy carny outfits, and a romantic, torrid affair make this movie an emotional roller-coaster of a ride!

Anne Baxter gives an excellent performance which is unforgettable! A must see movie. Well worth the watch, especially for those who love the carnival and its array of colorful characters.....",1381622400,5,982,5.37012987012987
932906,1,6304819579,"I bought this VCI-version of ""Carnival Story"" and it is a good movie but the colors of the DVD are indeed washed-out, but what's more, at least on my copy, the sound is really terrible!!!",1371859200,,187,4.371428571428571
932907,3,6304819579,"This VCI release of Carnival Story is the only version I've seen. It's from a 16mm print so the image is on the fuzzy side and the color is a little washed out. I enjoyed it. It's a decent movie, written by Dalton Trumbo and Kurt Neumann.",1371686400,,238,4.085106382978723
932908,3,6304819579,"I just received the DVD of Carnival Story that I ordered from Amazon and was surprised to see it is a DVD-R. Nowhere on the listing does it mention this. I think they should always list this information in the product description. On the plus side, the Roan transfer is far better than the Alpha one. Not remotely archival quality but good color nevertheless.",1335744000,,359,4.625

932975,1,6304819579,"This is the worst reproduction of a movie I have ever obtained from Amazon.com.
I think a copy like this one should be removed from the order list before someone else gets stuck with it.
The picture and sound are awful and it doesn't even fit the screen properly.
Even some dollar DVD's I purchased from Walmart look better than this one.

932976,3,6304819579,"The roan edition of Carnival Story could have been better.  It's an interesting film and plays well.  The only issue with Roan on this one are the number of bad splices toward the end of the film.  I have seen another print of this film on a 50-movie pack without the splices.  After watching a number of different Roan DVD's, on occasion they have splice problems with some of their prints.  I don't  understand why they just don't use 2 prints of a film to make a good one.  This is the reason I have to knock off stars.  Update:  VCI has an edition of ""Carnival Story"" which I would now recommend over other editions.  Other than a couple of minor imperfections, the quality is better and there are NO splices.",1259712000,5,713,4.374045801526718
932977,4,6304819579,"A seedy American carnival tries to change its luck in Germany. Steve Cochran at at his sexy best as the bad guy. Cochran and Baxter have some hot scenes that are sometimes cut when this shows on TV. My dvd is intact with apparently, no cuts at all in  the steamy shower scene. I gave the film a 4 but Steve and Anne rate a 5 for their romantic scenes.",1241654400,10,351,4.014285714285714

932979,5,6304819579,"Old movie but worth watching .The sound quality and picture quality is not that good since it was made in 1954,but it is very enjoyable  to watch. I first purchased this movie at a discount store. There was 2 movies on the DVD,
Carnival Story and another film. When I was in the middle of watching
Carnival Story the sound suddenly became muted in the last half of the film. I liked the movie so much that I ordered one from amazon just to see how the movie ends..The movie stars Anne Baxter who played "" Nefretiri "" in the remarkable Ten Commandments. It is about a traveling carnival show touring in  Germany. Baxter first falls in love with one guy who works at the carnival,but he turns out to have  a deceptive character ,he ends up dying from a 100 foot fall from a ferris wheel..Then she falls for another man,the high diver who stars in the carnival. He performs daily diving off a 200 foot ladder into a fire-lit pool below. He ends up dying from a fall .Lastly when you think Baxter's love life is a tragedy. She links up with a 3rd man who was a close friend of the high diver. If  you like to watch old movies ,this is a good choice.",1154649600,,1145,4.238532110091743

932982,4,6304819579,"The story of a young German woman who gets entangled in an American Carnival touring Germany after WW2. Men are attracted to her, to help her, to love her, to use her. She has a great courage that enables her to move swiftly from the kitchen to the top of the carnival by becoming a star in a diving act. She is good, very good, and resolute to succeed. But she cannot manage her relations with men properly and leads them to death in the strangest conditions. She can only run away, with another man of course, away from the successive dramas. Love cannot be the tool of success nor of ambition.

932983,2,6304819579,"An American carnival,failing to draw the crowds Stateside,decides to tour Germany in a bid to restore its fortunes.
The carnival ramrod,played by Steve Cochran,is robbed by a destitute young German woman,Willi,played most unconvincingly by Anne Baxter. Instead of handing her over to the police he offers her a job with the carnival as a kitchen skivvy and the two begin an affair that runs into complications when the carnival's star attraction ,a high diver ,takes her under his wing and makes her part of the act,and subsequently marries her.
The stage is then set for illicit romance,suspicious deaths and near fatal injuries before the final confrontation on a ferris wheel brings proceedings to a merciful ending
The major problem for me was that never for one second did Baxter persuade me that she was capable of entrancing not just her male colleagues but a freelance photographer(a wooden George Nader)let alone become a star circus performer in her own right,something which takes years of dedication and practice,not a few days instruction. The void which this leaves at the centre of the movie undermines its credibility
Cochran and Bettger,who plays the high diver are fine here,and there is a sturdy cameo from the ever reliable Frank Faylen
Garish colour and flat direction further drag things down. The colour is horrible as well-really harsh and garish.
If you want circus movies track down ""Trapeze"",or ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" for ones that get it right.",1009497600,5,1478,5.1115702479338845
7878032,4,6304819579,"The early Fifties seemed to be the golden age of greatest-show-on-earth movies, and Carnival Story rates as an under-the-radar curio, highly watchable and enjoyable if one doesnt take all the goings on too seriously. In addition to circus noir, maybe theres a subgenre we could deem carnival noir, and certainly Nightmare Alley from a few years prior would take pride of place.
Anyhow, getting back to Carnival Story: of course the main attraction in Anne Baxter, who looks fetching in all those swimsuits she seems to be wearing in every other scene. But she does some darn good acting too. BTW has anyone else noticed that her German accent has decided overtones of Marlene Dietrich, in a duskier sort of way? Other pluses include the on-location scenes filmed in Germany, the gloriously lurid Agfacolor hues, and the spot-on supporting cast of which the unctuously sinister, albeit charming, Steve Cochran rates first among equals.
For me Carnival Story just ekes out four stars, for sheer entertainment value and Miss Baxters subtly overwrought performance.",1479600000,,1061,5.174418604651163
