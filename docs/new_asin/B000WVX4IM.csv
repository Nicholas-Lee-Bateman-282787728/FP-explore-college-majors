8225845,5,B000WVX4IM,"This is a 25-minute full body workout using soft weighted balls; the workout is taken from Gin Miller's ""Build Up Your Muscles"" DVD.  After a brief explanation on some of the moves she will be doing in the workout, Gin uses the balls in creative ways to work both your upper and lower body.  The DVD includes a fun 20-minute cardio workout as well.  Gin has such a fun sense of humor, I really enjoyed this workout!",1203811200,5,415,4.363636363636363
8225846,5,B000WVX4IM,"I have been using this DVD for about two weeks and I can really tell a difference, especially in the hips, buns, and core. These seem to be the main focus of the workout. Gin provides great information on posture and proper positioning. Working with the toning balls is both simple and challenging. Gin knows how to use the balls along with your body weight to provide resistance and weight-bearing exercises that your can really feel working. My husband has already noticed my tummy tightening up!",1202342400,3,498,4.8023255813953485
