8190469,5,B000PCFI3C,"If you have the slightest interest in this wonderful skill, flint knapping, then this is the one film that is almost a necessity.  It is by far the ""Grand Daddy"" of all such films.  Last evening I sat for just a little less than two hours completely mesmerized as I watched this work for probably the thirtieth time.  It is absolutely amazing what Waldorf can do with a rock!

I make it a point to attend at least two major Knap-Ins a year and have done of for at least the past 15 years.  Having met, talked with and watched in amazement Waldorf work many times, I still cannot believe he does what he does. I have watched and visited with many, many other fine knappers, but with one or two rare exceptions, none of them come as close to mastering this art form that Waldorf.  Although each time I see him and talk to him as he works, I learn something new, watching this production is in many ways better than being their in person.  Having a film that can be rewound and minor point examined and reexamined is a definite advantage is learning this art from.

This film starts with the basics...a big chunk of flint (or chert if  you will) and proceeds step by step as this large stone is turned into a beautiful point.  As is stated here, the first portion of the film deals with processing the raw flint, the nodules, the blocks or slabs and working them into what is known as Stage 3.  For some reason this is the area I have the most trouble with and I am constantly reviewing this film to pick up tips I may have missed in past viewings.

The second portion of the film deals with various billet strikes and swings, holding positions, and the all important preparation work needed to build a platform.  Waldorf then displays an extremely technical and graphic example of proper methods for flake pressuring.  A most wonderful Adena point is the end result of this demonstration.  Of particular interest to me though, at this point in my own development, is his addressing the methodology for producing the fluting required to produce the Clovis point.  Few other films, and goodness knows I have watched enough of them, so vividly display this technique.

As an added bonus we are shown the various notching techniques and the steps that need to be taken to produce very small points.  While technique is simpler here, it is still quite an education to see someone with the skill of this individual perform.  We even get a small segment showing the proper way to create a gunflint.

The tape is of very high quality and the sound is quite good. I must say though, as good as this tape is, it is very desirable to also own the companion book, The Art of Flint Knapping,"" by D.C. Waldorf.  This book is like a bible as far as this craft goes.  There are many, many knock-offs of this work, but nothing I have run across equals it.  Between this tape, the book it is based from and a few years of intense practice, a person cannot help but have the ability to make a pretty decent point.  Of course in this case, ""pretty decent"" is a relative point.  To produce the level of work that Waldorf produces, along with a small handful of others, takes years and years of experience and I do strongly feel a natural gift.  I know I will never in this life time come even close to what these guys are accomplishing, but then again, it is always nice to have dreams and something to shoot for.  I keep practicing and do indeed keep getting better and if I do not cut a finger or two off, suspect I will even improve more. I can only hope, I suppose.

Now one thing must be noted here.  Waldorf uses completely natural tools in his work.  Few of us actually do this and most of us use our hand tools we have crafted ourselves.  I strongly suggest that for the beginner, they use these ""modern"" handmade tools rather than the ones Waldorf uses, i.e. rock and horn.  I know I still use copper billits as opposed to moose or elk horn.  The same holds true with my flaking tools, i.e. I use copper rather than bone.  I simply do not have the skill to use all natural material.  On the other hand, I hope a large bolder falls on my head if I am ever caught or even tempted to use a pre-cut, machine made blank.  Shame on you if you are doing so!

If you can lay your hands on a copy of this work, by all means jump on it.  It is not the same as having Waldorf right in front of you, but it is the next best thing and as I stated above, in many ways even better.  I promise you that no matter what level you are at, you will learn valuable information from this tape and this book.
