8433922,1,B000JVT06U,Not much to say other than I was extremely disappointed in the visuals that were really boring. Quality of DVD and packaging is only reason it got any stars.,1368576000,,157,4.448275862068965
8433923,5,B000JVT06U,Awesome modern images that come in and out of a whole wide range of emotions. Killer soundtrack if you want to listen to it. Awesome backdrop for any party when on a projector.,1224720000,6,176,4.363636363636363
