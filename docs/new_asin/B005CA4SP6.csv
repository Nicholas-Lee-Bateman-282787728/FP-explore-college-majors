4652026,5,B005CA4SP6,"The plot in this movie concerns a boy at college who becomes one of these suicidal people who wants to kill others as he acts out his inner demons.  He does succeed in this but this film is really not about him.  It is about the shattering effect this act has upon his parents and their marriage.  The boy actually has a very minor role in the film whereas the parents are the leads.

Michael Sheen plays the father.  I've seen him in other roles and he always delivers.  I saw him as a soccer coach in one film where he did a terrific job and I don't even like sports!  He is yet another actor from the UK who can become an American for a film without any problem.  You would never know he is not an American. This film provides him a tour de force role where he can handle every emotion in the book with his only child's murders and suicide followed by the daily disintegration of his marriage.  The actress playing his wife also does a terrific job. I especially liked the way the movie handled other members of the extended family, colleagues and neighbors who have to deal with both of them in some way.

A few side issues... 1) Michael Sheen reminded me so much of a young David Morse (around the time he did ""Inside Moves"").
  2) When they checked in to the motel in a remote area, the clerk pops out and right away I'm thinking ""So that's what happened
  to Meatloaf!"" I forgot it was only a movie for a moment, and all I kept hearing in my head was: ""I would do anything for love,

Maria Bello and Michael Sheen are superb and believable as two parents reacting in there own ways to the tragedy of their son's choices.  It seems like an entire movie couldn't be made simply on the aftermath of a disaster, but this movie had me riveted from beginning to end.  The mother's emotional journey is truly the focus of the story, her struggle to understand what happened and process it .  Really well done.  Not as ugly and dark as similar movies, just really real and believable and sort of beautiful.",1438646400,,567,4.63
4652055,3,B005CA4SP6,"This movie could have been much better, though it does present food for thought of the turmoil the parents endured. These are talented actors, but neither gave a stellar performance. Overall though, not a bad watch.",1438387200,,215,5.0
4652056,5,B005CA4SP6,It was a very well done movie. Although very sad story it shows the other side of a story. I think it might make people think about what families go threw.,1438214400,,155,4.032258064516129
4652057,4,B005CA4SP6,"I had higher hope for this movie. It wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't a great movie. The story is simple. Another screwed up kid goes berserk and walks into his school shooting up the place, killing others and then puts the gun to his head and blasts his life away.

The story is told or is supposed to be told from the parents point of view. These seem to be good, responsible and caring parents. They love this kid, they are even in the midst of trying to figure out a vacation spot that all will enjoy and their kid is a part of that; decisions are made by all.

This is a horribly sad story played out in our headlines over and over through the years with no real explanation that makes sense in all cases.

I, being the parent of a troubled teen (not that troubled thank goodness) never blamed the parents unless it came out that they were crack whores, husband beating animals, trailer park trash drug dealers or the like and even then there's a choice to be made....something a lot of people forget!

A child, a teen, an adolescent knows right and wrong, if not learned from his parents certainly tv, books and movies spell it out real clearly!

I think what we have seen, for the most part, are parents that gave their kids what they thought they needed; nobody is perfect and nobody has all the answers.

I don't think they delved into the parents anquish quite enough in this movie. They certainly showed the despair, the disbelief and how others jumped right on the 'blame the parents' bandwagon.

I ran a group of parents that had troubled teens for ll years. I'd say (and who can know for sure) that at least 90-95 percent of our parents were decent, hardworking, caring and responsible parents but when a kid goes 'wrong' there is no pat answer.

The movie is worth seeing but there are really no revelations; no 'that's why' moments; just a very sad look at what is going on in our youth today and absolutely no answer; there simply isn't one--at least that we are sure of!",1435968000,2,1985,4.389645776566757

4652060,5,B005CA4SP6,"This is one of the most emotionally gut wrenching movies I have ever watched.  You literally feel like you are the parents and you are going through this experience.  I highly recommend this movie.  My husband was hesitant to watch it due to the title, however, once we started to watch it, he kept pausing it so we could discuss what was going.  He really liked this movie.  It was an experience of total immersion in the story.",1416182400,4,429,4.448717948717949

4652062,5,B005CA4SP6,A very different perspective.  Everyone forgets the parents of the perpetrator are victims as well.  This movie does demonstrate the struggles of the parents as they try to figure out why their child would do such an act.,1403740800,,221,4.7894736842105265
4652063,4,B005CA4SP6,This movie had a great cast and full of good acting but a very downer of a movie. Michael Sheen is a very underrated actor in my opinion.,1395014400,,137,3.9285714285714284
4652064,5,B005CA4SP6,"Great film. It reflects the painful and intimate perspective of  the death  of  a killer, through the eyes of his  parents. Because it's always easier to blame the parents in a tragedy such as this one, many won't get it.",1382140800,,221,4.45

Touching emotion that led to seperation but them brought them
back together",1370649600,,135,5.181818181818182
4652066,3,B005CA4SP6,"While I don't want to be *too* harsh on a movie that clearly sets out to be emotional (and it succeeds in that respect) and of course, given the sensitive subject matter concerning a kid who goes crazy and shoots up his college classmates, this is another reason I don't want to be too critical, but the thing is, Beautiful Boy fails to leave me feeling satisfied.  It's about how the parents react and cope with their son being the one responsible for a college shooting.

As a parent, it's just unfathomable to believe it's your own child who was the shooter.  You don't want to believe it- you *refuse* to believe it.  While it makes sense that the mother felt an uncontrollable and overwhelming feeling of sadness when the police knocked on her door to deliver the dreaded news that her son is dead, it didn't seem realistic that the father would hide in the background and not feeling any emotion whatsoever.  He didn't even feel the need to comfort his wife during this moment.  Really strange.

However, and maybe I'm totally off track here, I sort of expected the parents of the victims to be pretty angry and not hesitate to place blame on the parents.  I expected a fairly large chunk of storytelling to focus strictly on their bitter anger.  I figured during one particular basketball game, the kids would pick a fight with the father who went out there to blow off steam but... they don't.  Instead the father walks to his car and cries.

Simply put, Beautify Boy is an emotional take on a major tragedy.  Angry feelings crops up sometimes but for the most part, it focuses around the parents coping with their emotions and trying to figure out their place in the world after such a tragedy.

The good news is that there's storyline consistency when it concerns other aspects, such as the parents eventually coming to the realization that they must start over and live somewhere else as the best means to get away from it all.  That's about the best thing parents can do.  Also, it was never really stated (unless I missed it) what made their son go on a violent shooting rampage.  I admit I may have missed this part, however.  Not enough devotion to their son.

Overall, emotionally devastating, but not as much as one would expect.  You can pretty much guess the parents reaction since for the most part their feelings are believable (at least, the mother's reaction- however the father does eventually release an emotional outburst of sadness near the end which is appropriate and necessary).  I still recommend it however.",1366588800,,2539,4.662921348314606
4652067,5,B005CA4SP6,"I accidentally caught the last half of this on Starz and was absolutely mezmerized.  I had seen the synopsis in my satellite guide, but I was not interested.  It sounded too ""Lifetime"" or movie-of-the-week.  It wasn't.

For details on the plot, incredible acting, etc., look to other reviews.  No need for me to re-hash.  I did like that the whole movie gave me a different perspective on this all-too-relevant situation - the perspective of the parents of a child who goes on to kill a lot of people in one event.  Did the parents see some behaviors in their son which troubled them?  Yes, but this film also illuminates the concept that almost NO parent or even NO acquaintance of such a child could begin to foresee or imagine their child could perpetrate the carnage to come.

What got me the most in this film is that it does not try to answer the unanswerable.  It doesn't wrap all the loose ends up in a nice bow to make us all feel safe, wistful and sun-shiney at the end of the film.  Rather it just shows the aftermath to the parents of the killer.  I didn't get that the point of this film was to garner sympathy for such parents.  It was just to show a perspective.

This film was quite unexpected.  It is impactful and powerful.  Unfortunately, it is all too relevant.",1366070400,,1281,4.4334763948497855
4652068,5,B005CA4SP6,Skip this film if you are suicidal or chronically depressed.  It may take a lot out of you.  The parents are set up so that the audience can neither blame nor excuse them.  Certainly the troubled kid was not ready to leave home at 18.  They go through all the emotional stages a tv movie would portray and more subtle ones a tv movie would miss.  I eventually found the extended close up shots effective with these two expressive actors.,1365379200,,437,4.4125
4652069,4,B005CA4SP6,"Overall, this is an intense journey down the rabbit hole of a pretty unpleasant dramatic story.
So, if you're not into that, don't watch this movie.  I should also say, while you may not like the story (it's not a ""feel good"" movie), the magnitude of drama, the story, the character's, are incredible.  Hands down, magnificent.  There are movie's that win awards and get critical acclaim, that pale in comparison to the ""raise the bar"" of this movie, in my opinion.
The movie follows two parents, having issues with their marriage, as they find out their only child, has just opened fire at his local school, and then turned the gun on himself.  I can't even imagine the aftermath of that.
What I found so interesting about this particular story, is that it's very rare stories get made from the perspective of someone who is NOT the victim (i.e. their child was not the one who was shot by the alleged ""killer"").  It's a look at the other side of the coin.  Watching the movie, made me think about that other perspective, that other experience.  I like movies that make you think of things you wouldn't normally.
The story unfolds as the parents try and make sense of it, try and deal with all the media, and being suddenly thrust out into the spotlight of judgement.  It also brings up issues in their marriage, of course it would as would any type of extreme stress.
Okay, maybe not a ""feel good"" movie, but still an excellent story, excellent raw acting, great directing.  Done very simply, but you're left with a punch to the gut.
I would purchase this movie, and would watch it again, if nothing else then to study how they told such a great story.",1365120000,,1654,4.542087542087542
4652080,5,B005CA4SP6,This movie was great! It really gives you a different perspective on serious issues like the one that happens in the movie.,1360368000,,123,4.636363636363637
4652081,5,B005CA4SP6,"I purchased this movie because it was on many critics' lists for best film.  It's hard to watch at times.  It's very current with what is happening in today's world.  It is VERY well acted and also very sad.  There is NOT a lot of ""action"" but the dialog and story is riveting all the same.  It explains the viewpoint of the parents of a college age son that shoots up his school and what the family goes through too.",1359244800,,417,4.1625
4652082,5,B005CA4SP6,"Beautiful Boy is one of those films that will leave you breathless. Beautiful Boy is the story of a depressed College student who does the unthinkable and his recently separated parents played brilliantly by Martin Sheen and Maria Bello, have to find a way to cope and deal with this son's unimaginable act. Beautiful Boy cuts right to the heart and bone and never sugarcoats, there are some tough scenes but they are moving and so real. Sheen and Bello are absolute perfection, they have never been better. I highly recomemnd this extraordinary drama, enjoy!",1358208000,2,559,4.894736842105263
4652083,1,B005CA4SP6,"This is not a movie - it is an endurance test.  An exercise in how much depressing material you can watch during one movie.  None of the characters are very compelling, except some of the ancilary ones like the mother's writer client, the mother's brother's wife, and the hotel clerk (Meat Loaf).  We are introduced to the son early on - but you really never discover what makes him tick, except for his poem.  When he commits this horrible and violent act you are left to guess why.  The scary thing is that he does not appear to be ""Manson crazy"", evil, violent or angry - just horribly depressed and alone wishing he were back on that beach.  The rest of the movie is flat out boring and self-indulgent.  Actors chewing the scenery.  There is nothing insightful or remotely interesting about how they handle the memory of their son.  What would they think?  Who was my son?  How much did I really know about him.  I believe they still love him, but they have to be thinking - what was I in love with all those years, him - or my idea of him.  How did I not know he was capable of this.  Was I in love with a vicious killer.  I will never find out.  Just a few seconds on a DVD.  What do I know about my spouse - all these years living together.  What kind of parents were we.  If I had taken the time to known more, maybe I could have stopped it.  Guilt, desparation, anger, depression, shame.  A movie about a couple addressing these issues would be interesting indeed.  This is not that movie.  It is all very cliche.  Because of this superficiality there is a lot of emoting for emoting's sake, depression for depression's sake, ""deep"" facial expressions passing for acting - a stupid reason to make a film about such a sensitive and original subject.",1341532800,3,1757,4.368421052631579
4652084,4,B005CA4SP6,"The story begins with a phone call from a college student to his parents, a phone call which will be played over and over in the parents' heads for the rest of their lives.  They have no idea that the next morning their son will be involved in a school shooting, killing many other students and them himself.  The reason why he did it is never explained, although his parents certainly speculate on the cause - and one that obviously comes up is that perhaps they were inadequate parents.  They wonder if they are really to blame for the death of their son; and the deaths of the other students that day.  The performances from Michael Sheen and Mario Bello are great.  Together, they capture the heartache and the rage that must go through anyone's mind who experiences the loss of a child.

There isn't really a happy moment in ""Beautiful Boy"", although by the end you do feel a sense of hope for the future.  The movie is slowly-paced; it takes its time dealing with the character's grief.  The performances are what makes it all worthwhile, and so I highly recommend this film - though it might make a good rental (I'm not sure this is a film most people would want to watch over and over again).

The DVD also includes a few deleted scenes.  There is also an audio commentary track with the director, editor, and cinematographer.",1334707200,,1334,4.520833333333333
4652085,2,B005CA4SP6,"There are movies that entertain and then there are movies that make you think. When a movie can do both at the same time it's an amazing feat. Unfortunately this is a rare occurrence and these movies usually fail. Such is the case with BEAUTIFUL BOY.

The story revolves around a couple on the verge of divorce. Married for some time Bill (Michael Sheen) is in the process of finding a new apartment. Wife Kate (Maria Bello) is planning a family vacation, one last time to go somewhere together with their son Sam (Kyle Gallner). Away at school, Sam seems bothered when he calls his folks one night. Why is apparent the next day.

While at work, Bill's co-workers are watching the news and concerned about him. Someone has opened fire at the college where Sam goes and massacred a number of students there. Kate is told the same by her friend and neighbor whose daughter also attends the same college. Bill comes home to be with Kate and eventually the police show. It's not just to notify the couple that Sam is dead, but to tell them he was the shooter and took his own life.

The rest of the film follows the parents dealing with the guilt and frustration they feel about the event their son has placed them in. Was there something they did wrong? Could they have foreseen what would happen? Why would he do such a thing? Couple this with the press hounding them and they begin to wonder if this all could have been their fault.

Leaving their home where reporters camp out daily, they spend time with Kate's brother and his family. Each deals with the problem in their own way. Bill looks at things from an orderly point of view, making sure they issue a press release and keeping up a strong face while he mourns in private.

Kate is the emotional one, first denying that any of this could have taken place. She insists that their son did nothing, that he couldn't have done something so heinous. When video of him ranting in a recorded message he left behind surfaces she must face the truth. But she still retreats into herself, attempting to subtly take the mother's position in her brother's home.

Eventually the couple leave and hole up in a motel where their various means of dealing with the problem shoots them up and down the emotional scale, one moment arguing with one another and the next falling into each other's arms in love once more only to fight again the next morning. Neither one is prepared for what happened or for what is going on now. They just deal with it themselves in their own way, never completely offering each other the support that each needs at this time. Only time will tell if they come out of this nightmare stronger or defeated.

The film focuses not on the son and his deed but on the aftermath he leaves behind. While the characters are faced with questions about themselves and their family, for the most part they seem more concerned with themselves than with their son, they seem selfish to an extent. How one would deal with this sort of thing is hard to imagine but this couple seems intent on their own feelings and nothing more.

And this makes for a movie that offers two roles where critics and awards type shows will respond with praise but that viewers will watch with a certain amount of boredom. Running just over 2 hours it's hard to sit and watch the pain and the self flagellation that goes on for nearly that entire time. Over and over again we watch them fight and seek someone to blame, more often than not taking the brunt of it all. And that's a weight that anyone would find hard to handle. But that's all the movie focuses on. It never offers any relief or solutions.

The subject matter is topical and something few of us would ever even consider thinking about and yet with the number of mass killings perhaps it's something we should. One would hope that placed in the same circumstances each of us would be able to find some way of dealing with the problem and hopefully better than this couple does.

Watching the film is like placing yourself in the same situation. You feel nothing but sad and depressed. With each passing moment as they fail to find a solution you just keep begging that it will end. Some may think of this as art but for me it's just a way to encourage depression. I'd rather spend my money on something else.",1332201600,2,4304,4.478316326530612
4652086,5,B005CA4SP6,"""Beautiful Boy"" is a heartbreaking movie that centers on the grief felt by parents who lose a child.  Bill and Kate are an average couple with a secret: They intend to separate soon. Before they can bring themselves to tell their college-aged son, however, they receive the news that no parent ever wants to hear: their son is dead. Without going into spoilers, their grief is compounded by the circumstances in which he died, circumstances that prevent them from receiving emotional support from others. Most of the movie is an almost claustrophobic look at what happens when a married couple who had concluded they no longer loved each other has only each other to turn to.

This movie deserves watching if only for the masterful performances of the lead actors, Michael Sheen and Maria Bellow. That they did not win major acting awards for this film is, in my opinion, a major injustice. I can only conclude that it is because the movie was not a big financial success, no doubt because the overall tone of the movie was so dark.

The subject being, your child using a gun and killing other children and then killing (or not)himself or herself.
This true to life scenario has only picked up in the past 20 years, and I personally have always felt a very deep sorrow for not only the children and parents of the victims, but especially for
the parents of the assailant.  How do you ever deal with knowing your kid has murdered others?
Not only do you have the grief that the other parents have, but you get to add in guilt and of course that distasteful human reaction of morbid curiosity.
This is the only movie I have ever watched on this subject, as it would not be on the top of my
list to produce, but the subject had to be breached for us (the general public) to mull over.
The movie was hard to watch, but as I have stated, I have always wondered just how these parent can cope with the situation and the movie helped some in that endeavor.

4652089,5,B005CA4SP6,"I had low expectations for Beautiful Boy when it first arrived. I've always thought Maria Bello has been a downward spiral since her ER days (fifteen years ago) and Michael Sheen is often pretty hit or miss. For every Frost/Nixon, there's a Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. But both of them are at the top of their game here.

Beautiful Boy's premise is nothing shy of horrifying. It would've been pretty rough even if the two weren't going through a separation. It's the kind of film where you struggle to find the correct emotion, because the events of the film are too gruesome to process. Unlike a horror movie, this one hits real close to home.

The real standout for me in this film is Alan Tudyk. I've been a huge fan of his work since his Firefly days (and a Knight's Tale), but he's really spectacular here.

I don't think I've been this shaken by a film since Requiem for a Dream. Don't watch this movie if you're going to be annoyed with the fact that it's probably going to rattle you up for awhile after you've seen it. But it's a really good film that I highly recommend.",1328745600,,1084,4.41

So even though it is discussed by others, including Amazon, I will not reveal the twist that creates the movie's premise.

However, I will tell you that I was glad I watched it alone. There were many tears shed that I had absolutely no control over. Sheen and Bello are incredible in revealing their characters and the pain they are going through both together and also seemingly worlds apart. The subject matter is handled with dignity and a quietness that showcases the roles of Bello and Sheen. The camera work is close and personal at times and almost eavesdropping at other times, peering in on the scene from around a corner or behind a shelf.

This is not a light movie and I would recommend watching it with a clear schedule to see it from beginning to end without distraction or interruptions. The full effect can be felt that way and it is worth feeling the full impact - as heartbreaking as it is.

On a side note, seeing Meatloaf in well played serious role was great.

A terrific movie with all to true subject matter.",1325980800,,1282,4.438297872340425

""Beautiful Boy"" (2011)

Note: mild spoilers below
---------------------------------------------
Do you ever wonder about those horrible news stories, the ones where some wacko brings a gun to school or to work and kills a bunch of people, what it must be like for the families of the killer, what anguish they must be going through? This harrowing, expertly crafted film presents a nuanced but unrelenting emotional portrait of a husband and wife whose college-age son goes off the deep end and kills dozens of his classmates. Michael Sheen and Maria Bello turn in exceptional performances as the parents whose already-strained marriage is blown to atoms by the devastating news. Although the script may overstate how judgmental other people may be towards these parents (or perhaps not...) the film rings true on many levels. The acting is impressive: Sheen in particular is stunning, and all the supporting roles are equally solid. The film has a queasy feel; it's uncomfortable and dark, but extremely well-made and certainly worth watching (but only if you're up for a depressing, thoughtful exploration of human misery...)

4652105,5,B005CA4SP6,"I'll get this out of the way.
Brilliant acting.
Amazing direction.
Pacing, score, pretty much everything was brilliant.
Definitely worth a watch.
Here's why...

The movie is about your average married couple who's college age kid snaps and goes on a school shooting rampage before taking his own life.
My memories of Columbine and the other various school shootings over the years are still very fresh in my mind.
The one thing that I always wondered was how the families related to the shooters dealt with what had happened.
I think this movie does an excellent job of showing what these families go through.
When Columbine happened, I like many was the first to point my finger at the parents.
But what I've noticed about a lot of these shooters is that they're almost always late teens to early twenties. That's usually right when schizophrenia symptoms start to manifest in young men.
So no, in a lot of cases I think the parents raise the kids just fine and are just as baffled by what happened as everyone else.
I know it's of little comfort to the victims families but all too often the warning signs of mental illness go unnoticed.
The only thing we can really learn from tragedies like this are to better recognize the symptoms as well as finding better ways to treat people who are mentally ill before things escalate to such violence.
This was a very difficult movie for me to make it through.
If you cry easily, you better have tissue near by.
I did.
A powerful and disturbing movie that I'm glad I saw.
I probably won't ever watch it again it was too depressing.
It definitely left a mark on me.
Very sad.
As I said before I, like many pointed my finger of judgement at the parents.
That wasn't fair of me or anyone else to do.
Sometimes there are answers.
Sometimes there aren't.
Sometimes the answers, like mental illness only become apparent after the fact.
This movie made me think.
It made me cry.
It makes me hope that we find better ways of helping people around us who are in need of it.
An amazing and powerful movie.

Though the story could have veered off into the politics of how and why, it takes a far more personal approach, showing us the effect on the shooter's parents--on them as individuals and as a couple.

4652110,5,B005CA4SP6,An excellent heart-wrenching movie that does not get weighted down in trying to preech a viewpoint.  It allows you to come to your own conclusion.,1322179200,,146,4.84
4652111,5,B005CA4SP6,"This movie is not a movie to be seen in times of grief.  The scenario is one that every family experiences when their child or loved one commits mass murder and then kills him/herself.  Everyone involved becomes an unwitting victim to other peoples' emotions.  Do not watch this during the Holidays.

The lead roles, convincingly acted by Maria Bello and Michael Sheen, are both believable characters.  They are an affluent couple in a large home.  Both have good jobs.  The viewer learns right away that the marriage is in trouble (the pair sleeps in separate beds) and that their son seems depressed over something (his parent's marriage?).  Thirteen minutes into the movie, the viewer learns that he died on the university campus during the massacre and that he was the murderer.  He had called his parents just the night before.  How do the parents cope with this news becomes the premise of this film.

What could have been a typical scream and cry drama involving a mass killer turns into a psychological drama of a grieving couple. They deal with the media's biased descriptions of their dead son; they deal with their own loss and guilt with friends, family, co-workers and especially between each other and themselves.  Both husband and wife have different ways of coping with their grief, and the stronger of the two is not revealed until the very end.

This movie shoes how the couple deals with ostracization and scrutinization by their neighbors.  People turn on the couple, from alleged reporter/book writer, curious neighbors, old friends of the dead son, and various people in town who spy on them. This movie sensitively shows that when a crime is committed, everyone involved suffers and everyone is a victim.

This movie also delves into the inner turmoil of the two people. The tragic incident requires the couple to truly listen to one's needs, one's pain, one's despair.  It's this dispair that the husband and wife have left in common.  One scene, ""Reconnection"" is especially touching, which makes the end of this movie all the more puzzling.  How they deal with their grief in the end is never resolved.  It leaves a haunting impression.

This movie is well-done, using mostly unknown actors in demanding roles.  It's worth a viewing.  Just don't watch it while depressed.  The message here is that everyone can do a bad thing, and we must remember the good in everyone.",1321833600,,2395,4.873762376237623
4652112,5,B005CA4SP6,"How does one move on after the unthinkable happens? That is the question addressed in Beautiful Boy.

The movie begins with a loving couple playing with their beautiful boy on the beach. The boy is around 4 in the scene. The next scene fasts forward to the present day where the loving couple is now struggling with their marriage while the boy is off to his freshman year in college. Maria Bello plays Kate, the wife and mother who is a bit controlling. Things have to be done a certain way. She suggests a family vacation to see if the marriage can survive. Michael Sheen plays Bill, the husband and father who seems to be checked out of both the marriage and being a father. Their son Sam calls to talk to them the night before a horrific tragedy strikes his school. You can see there is something wrong but the communication between the three is pretty much non-existent. The next day their lives are changed forever. Can they survive the unthinkable? Who can they turn to who will understand their pain? These are the struggles Kate and Bill now face. I could feel their pain and frustration with the unknown. I was asking ""why"" right along side them. Their story is complex but well done.

The acting in the film is superb! Maria Bello and Michael Sheen do an excellent job catching the raw emotions and numbness that a parent in this situation might feel. This is a subject that really isn't talked about much. These are the parents whose loss is not addressed on the evening news. Meat Loaf plays a small role in the movie and does an great job as well. Michael Armbruster and Shawn Ku have written a story that is both heartbreaking and powerful. Shawn Ku did a phenomenal job directing the film. The cinematography by Michael Fimognari was well done and effective. I felt like I was peeking in on a family trying to survive.

Although the primary meat of the story is the parents, I personally would've liked to have heard a little more about their son as he's only introduced briefly.

Furthermore, I thought although Bello and Sheen did a fair job of playing the characters, the characters of Bill and Kate needed to be more fleshed out sooner as actual people instead of parents affected by their son's death and the public spotlight focused on them.

On the plus side, I found Beautiful Boy to be a very realistic portrayal of the grief that parents go through when they've lost a child in such a shocking manner. The second half really picks up emotionally. As the characters leave the shock stage and begin to come to grips with their anger. I'm worried that audiences won't look past the first part of the movie and walk away wondering why should we care about any of these people?

Their son is in his first year of college. It is never stated where he is attending school, but this has many of the patterns of the Virginia Tech killings. We see what the parents of the shooter go through. They never come to grip or resolution of what has happened, and maybe they never will; but the story that unfolds is riveting and true to reality.
This is a realistic script and the acting of all is not overplayed. We can feel the questions that all parents would ask...what we did wrong? whose fault is this?

Fortunately we never see the violence. The shooting is off screen so we do not have to witness horrific scenes that many Hollywood directors seem to relish.

The married couple is playing by Michael Sheen and Maria Bello, two wonderful actors who are pitch perfect. We see their worlds come apart as they attempt to cope with what has to be one of the worst things that could happen to a parent. It might in fact be too intense for parents--I kept thinking about how happy I am that I don't have kids.

4652118,3,B005CA4SP6,"""Beautiful Boy"" has an interesting premise: What if you lose your only child after he commits an unspeakable crime?

Bill and Kate are married. Seemingly in name only. They have separate bedrooms. We don't know if they are contemplating separation as Bill searches for an apartment that Kate isn't ready to hear about. Instead, she is focused on an upcoming family vacation. They are extremely polite with each other and it is in a genuine way but it is obvious that the marriage is empty.

Their son is at college. He appears to be saddened by the apathy he sees as he reads something he has written in one of his classes. He calls his parents and the viewer can see that he is very unhappy. The viewer doesn't know why. Is it because of his parents functioning-but-not-really marriage? Because of school? Mother and father don't pick up on his mood and say goodbye to him.

The next day, the news comes.

What follows after that is a couple that must deal with the fallout of their son's actions and also the way they've been dealing with each other.

Bill and Kate are superbly acted by Michael Sheen and Maria Bello. Neither strikes a false note in their performances. Their sadness and anger at their son. Their pain at what he has done to himself and to others.

But with that said, there is something missing in this story. Perhaps the end comes and goes in a way that is flat. Or perhaps it is the feeling that the story was made for the premise rather than to tell a story.

I'm not sure but while I do consider the performances to be of a wonderful caliber, the story itself seems more premise than substance. It is an okay movie, because the story doesn't quite live up to its potential.",1320969600,,1698,4.458064516129032

Bello seems to always wear a weary, skeptical expression in her roles; she always seems ready to crack wise.  This is just the way she looks I guess.  It is not a good look for her character here as she is portraying a grieving mother who is struggling with her marriage.  Michael Sheen lets slip his Britich accent occasionally; more inportantly, his character is weak in many ways but he seems unconvincing in that role.

When a married couple who have grown apart from each other emotionally and physically are told that not only is their beloved son dead, but that he was behind a violent crime, they must come to terms with their own feelings of responsibility while they bear the brunt of an angry, and often insensitive, public.

Directed by Shawn Ku ""Beautiful Boy"" is a powerful but difficult film to watch. As a parent I couldn't help but sympathize with the main characters of the film and their horror as they discovered what their son has done and trying to find meaning in each other as they examine what they could have done differently in raising their son.

The acting in ""Beautiful Boy"" is stellar; Michael Sheen continues to prove himself one of the best actors of his generation with the unusual and challenging roles he has taken on over the years. Every bit his equal Maria Bello (""Primse Suspect"" and ""A History of Violence"" among other projects)reaches deep into herself to create a believable character touched by tragedy and consumed by the guilt of her disintegrating marriage and the damage her own son has done.

4652132,5,B005CA4SP6,"BEAUTIFUL BOY is the gripping story of a parent's worst nightmare.

Maria Bello and Michael Sheen star as a married couple on the verge of separation who have stayed together for the past ten years because of their son.

One day, the boy (Kyle Gallner), a college freshman, walks into a classroom with two loaded guns, kills seventeen people, then turns a weapon on himself.

Shocked, grief-stricken and confused, Bello and Sheen now attempt to deal with the media storm that suddenly surrounds them, the subtle (and overt) shunning by friends and family and their own senses of guilt.

Directed by Shawn Ku, BEAUTIFUL BOY is a powerful, albeit depressing, drama that features award-caliber performances by its two stars, realistic dialogue and several emotionally draining scenes.

The problem is that the film takes 101 minutes to tell a story that could probably have been better told in half the time.  Indeed, once the initial shock of the shooting and its immediate aftermath has past, the film focuses on Bello and Keller and their tenuous relationship.  There are no surprises or significant plot turns, and it doesn't take an astute viewer to know how this story is going to end.

The synopsis briefly stated- a young college student goes on a mass shooting spree, killing 21 of his fellow students before killing himself. His parents are left with the aftermath, but instead of facing the media they run and hide first with family and then to a motel.

I found the movie gritty but the characters very unlikable. While sympathizing with their grief as well as the horror they were facing, the movie showed how dysfunctional the parents were. I do not know whether this was their coping mechanism or just the way they had always been. The movie seemed to suggest that there was a history of this behavior. It did not go as far as blaming the parents although each of them blamed the other one at different points in the movie.

Now only left with each other, what little love is left is put to the test as they face grief, confusion, heartache, guilt, blame, and fear of what to do with what is left of their relationship.

This movie is built around a story that unfortunately is not new. A student walks into a school one day and opens fire, killing students and teachers before turning the gun on himself. What makes this story different, is that it focuses on the parents of that student. What happens to THEM? How do they move forward? CAN they move forward?

As I watched this movie unfold, I sat in silence, barely stirring, unable to take my eyes off of the screen. A heartbreaking story, Beautiful Boy shows a couple who are breaking apart now having to come together to get through something no parent should ever have to face. Not only did they lose their only child, but they must live with knowing he is responsible for a mass murder, yet they may never know why. Coupled with this,they must deal with the media as well as anger from people who vilify their son as well as blame them for what he has done(after all, THEY raised him, surely it's THEIR fault he turned into a ""monster"").

I have loved Maria Bello in everything I have ever seen her in, but this may be her finest performance to date. Michael Sheen is incredible as well, as a father wondering if in some way, he himself is to blame for his son's actions.

This film is worth watching for their performances alone, though the supporting actors were all excellent, as well. One scene in particular stood out to me. As Bello sat at a table in a crowded restaurant waiting for Sheen to return, her strong exterior melted, and she dissolved into sobs. Bello totally sold the scene, which could have come off as overdramatic. Instead, it was one of the most touching scenes of the film. This movie is quiet and understated with an underlying desperation.

4652136,5,B005CA4SP6,"The basic premise of this movie is that a son goes on a shooting rampage and kills himself and his parents have to question their part in this tragedy, deal with the speculation generated by the press and publc, and question their own relationship which had been floundering quietly before the tragedy.
Unlike a lot of movies that are loosely based upon factual occurences, this movie was far and away a cut above. The script was not overworked or maudlin. It was well-written and presented the main characters as fully developed people and not stereotypes. The script manages to deal with grief --- and joy --- in a realistic way.
The casting was exceptional and the main actors Michael Sheen and Maria Bello did a wonderful job portraying the grief stricken parents. Sheen was, in particular, amazing. His acting is so innate yet subtle that he is able to go through a lot of conflicting emotions and still ring true to his characterization. Through much of this movie I felt as though I was a third person observer as opposed to the viewer of a movie. I totally bought into this movie.
This movie attacked a not uncommon problem that appears repeatedly in the news and managed to not turn into a trite cable tv movie. This movie was very good as well as involving. I felt the pain of these parents. A good movie should elicit an emotional reaction from its viewer. Beautiful Boy worked.",1320278400,,1389,4.650406504065041

Senseless death is something none of us has any control over and all we can do is deal with the aftermath as best we can.  A young boy in his freshman year of college has an emotional meltdown and kills several students and instructors at his college then turns the gun on himself.  Everyone is stunned, including his parents.  Why did he do it?  There are no easy answers.  Was there something his parents did wrong in his upbringing?  His parents, portrayed by Michael Sheen and Maria Bello, struggle to not only hang on to the love they had for their son but for each other.  Their marriage, which was already shaky before this crisis, is now in ruins.  All of the actors gave powerful performances that rang true and old softie that I am, I was already moist-eyed fifteen minutes into the film.

4652138,4,B005CA4SP6,"Beautiful Boy is the story of two parents, on the verge of separating, whose guilt and suffering bring them together during the aftermath of a tragic event.  The question of why their son commits an atrocious act is not answered as this movie focuses on the struggle of the parents who are trying to deal with the emotional upheaval the event has caused.  The pacing of the story is well metered and emphasized by wonderful performances by both Michael Sheen and Maria Bello as the stricken parents trying to come to terms with both why their son did what he did and how they may have played a part.  The fact that this film shifts the focus on the parents gives a different perspective as together they may or may not be the ones to blame, but their emotional journeys are no less touching than if their son had simply been a victim.  About the only point of contention is the limited way in which the son, Sam, is shown so there's no real conclusive ending or closure.
A well executed film that rarely falls flat but is hard to watch at times.  Not exactly high on overall entertainment value.  The movie is a bit of a downer and doesn't exactly end on an upbeat note so I don't feel it's worth repeated viewings, but it bears watching for variety's sake and the intricate manner in which the characters discover more about themselves.",1320192000,,1337,4.481481481481482
4652169,4,B005CA4SP6,"I was drawn to this dvd because I had just read the book Columbine.  I have always felt sorry for the parents of the kids that have done these horrific deeds.  We as a society have to find blame somewhere and so many times in these instances it ""has"" to be the parents fault.

This movie looks at what the parents of a school shooter goes through in the aftermath of the shooting.  This is not a light subject and I found myself turning the movie off several times just so I could get away from the heaviness.

Like so many parents in this day and age, Bill and Kate have done the best they know how to raise their son.  And like so many people now a days they have grown apart from the everyday grind that is life.  They know that they haven't heard from their son as much as they would like but he is in college now so it is to be expected.  They do not pick up on the fact that he is very upset when he calls, but we as the audience can see it in his face and manner.  They try desparately to get in touch with him when they hear that there is a shooting at his college but he never picks up his phone.  Only when the police come do they realize that it is their son who has done this horrible thing.

The rest of movie examines how the shooting effects each of the members of their family, including Kate's brother's family especially their young nephew.  Bill and Kate run the whole gamit from denial to blaming each other.

*spoiler*

The most heartwrenching scene for me was when Bill went to visit his sons grave and someone had spray painted Killer on the grave stone and he was desparetly was trying to get it off.

*end spoiler*

This movie shows that no matter how good of parents we are, that our children may make some very bad decisions.  And that we as a society need to stop trying to blame everyone else but the actual person who commits the deed.

Despite the heaviness this was an excellent movie.  It is rated R for some language and sexual situation but not to much of either.  Definately would not recommend for any one under 16 but I would let my 16 year old watch it with a discussion afterward.",1320192000,,2120,4.162162162162162
4652170,4,B005CA4SP6,"This sad and compelling, if oddly titled, movie explores what it might be like to have to live with being the parents of the perpetrator of a Virginia Tech-like massacre.

 The movie opens with a bit of old family film of  parents and son at the beach, then quickly moves into just-yesterday mode, with a frustrated wife and mother  on the phone with her  husband  and their only son, a college freshman; she's trying to get them involved in picking a destination for their next  family vacation, which only she herself seems interested in. Hours later comes a knock at the door, and life for the two remaining members of this already unhappy family will become the very worst kind of hell.

 I think this is a movie that is well worth seeing. We learn next to nothing about the son and what might have led him to do what he did; the focus is entirely on the parents. Maria Bello and Michael Sheen give strong and heartbreaking performances in these roles, but I can't imagine anyone outside the ""helping professions"" ever wanting to sit through this hour-and-a -half movie more than once.

 The only extras are two very brief deleted scenes; there's no commentary track or ""making of"" feature. Which is probably as it should be...making this powerful film stand entirely on its own.",1320105600,,1283,4.657777777777778

4652174,5,B005CA4SP6,"BEAUTIFUL BOY fills a gap in our understanding of how events change us.  The story is three stories, really: a marriage in disarray due to an increasing distance between  a husband and wife, the terrifying discovery that an only child is dead, and the horror of the reality that that dead child murdered classmates and faculty at his college without a knowledgeable prodrome.  It speaks loudly to contemporary marriages and families torn asunder by lack of communication in a time of sheltered or imposed privacy of cellphones, blogging, computers that prevent face to face communications at critical times.

Bill (Michael Sheen) and Kate (Maria Bello) are living a stalemate of a marriage on the brink of ending: Kate is a proofreader for writers (currently for Cooper played with great sincerity by Austin Nichols) while Bill immerses himself in his business life.  They now have separate bedrooms, their only tie is their son Sammy (Kyle Gallner) who is off to his first year of college.  Bill and Kate learn that there has been a shooting incident at Sammy's college and that a number of students were killed.  When police arrive at their home they receive the news that Sammy is among the dead but worse than that, Sammy is the one who killed all the students and faculty and they committed suicide. Bill and Kate are devastated, become the source of the paparazzi and move in with Kate's bother Eric (Alan Tudyk) and sister-in-law Trish (Moon Bloodgood) and their young son.  The tension continues to build and when Kate attempts to hide her grief by caring for the brother's house and family, Bill and Kate move to a motel run by a compassionate clerk (Meat Loaf Aday).  Events happen and Bill and Kate flirt with restoring their marriage only to separate: the manner in which they find their way back toward sanity by confronting their own demons is the quiet way in which this story ends. Instead of a predictable happy ending the audience is left in the throes of the mending process - a writer/director choice that makes the film far more dramatic than most.

Sheen and Bello give razor sharp portrayals of these two devastated, questioning people. This is their film and the way they react to every moment of the story is simply uncanny. Their performances are staggeringly well done.  But then the entire cast is polished, making this film a model for other films about difficult life situations credible.

4652175,5,B005CA4SP6,"Franck Tabouring, DVD Verdict --As the movie opens, it only takes a few minutes for viewers to realize Kate and Bill are not leading a happy marriage. The lack of communication and passion between the two is slowly eating away at them, and they're just about ready to go their separate ways. Interestingly enough, the news of their son's death certainly doesn't help the situation right away. Although Kate and Bill are both instantly hit with the same painful feelings of grief and blame, they don't immediately find the courage to confront the crisis together.

Herein lies some of the film's greatest appeal, because Ku and his writing partner Michael Armbruster keep challenging their main characters by not having this new tragedy simply erasing the problems they've been facing for quite some time. Through gripping dialogue and intense, highly emotional confrontations, Beautiful Boy does a fabulous job examining to what extent Bill and Kate's relationship suffers under the stress of their son's death, the resulting media attention, and their quest to find out what exactly drove their kid to commit such a horrendous act.

Michael Sheen and Maria Bello's performances inject the movie with the power and authenticity the story requires, and they hit all the right notes in every scene they're in--together or alone. Some of their heated arguments in the movie easily count among some of the most intense, emotionally charged, and heartbreaking scenes I've ever see in a drama. Some of the film's success is attributable to the clever material, but if I had to single out the greatest asset of Beautiful Boy, it would definitely be the lead cast.

The complexity of the story aside, Beautiful Boy also works so well because of Ku's inspiring direction and his buddy Michael Fimognari's documentary style cinematography. Pair this with subtle editing and an appropriate soundtrack, and you're in for an extraordinary viewing experience. As beautifully as the movie is shot though, I can't say I am entirely impressed with the high-definition transfer. The Blu-ray edition offers a 1.78:1/1080p widescreen version of the feature, but the image is pretty grainy throughout. It may not be as noticeable in some scenes, but overall, the heavy grain does stick out. That said, I've got no complaints in the audio department; the Dolby True-HD 5.1 transfer simply rocks.

In terms of special features, Beautiful Boy (Blu-ray) offers some deleted scenes. Also included is a very informative and intelligent audio commentary with Shawn Ku, his director of photography, and his editor. Ku does most of the talking, but he really digs deep into the subject matter of the film, touching on his inspiration for the movie, the depth of the characters, and why he chose to develop their relationship they way he did. For indie fans and fellow filmmakers, this is one commentary you should not miss at any cost.

4652176,4,B005CA4SP6,"""Things would be different from now on. They didn't know if it would be better or worse but for certain things would change."" Bill (Sheen) and Kate (Bello) are getting things in order for their separation. No longer happy they barely talk anymore. When news of a shooting at their son's college comes they begin to fear the worst. When told that it was their son who did the shooting they begin to wonder why. This is a very emotional movie and is sometimes tough to get through. The acting is excellent (not surprising) and is very realistic and subdued. I really did like this movie but there seemed to be something missing to make it great. After movies like ""Other Woman"" and ""Rabbit Hole"" the subjects of children tragedy has been all over and for some reason this one did not have the same effect on me that those did. This movie did tackle the rarely seen subject of what the parents of someone who does that goes through and made you take a second thought at how you may have felt after the Columbine or Virgina Tech families. Overall, a powerful story with great acting that is missing something to make it great. I'm just not sure what it is. I do recommend this though. I give it a B.

4652177,4,B005CA4SP6,"Sam Carroll (Kyle Gallner) calls his parents from college. His father Bill (Michael Sheen) doesn't speak to him for very long; his mother Kate (Maria Bello) speaks to him longer but neither really says anything of particular importance. What they don't see is that Sam is on the verge of tears. The next day, Sam is dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after perpetrating a shooting spree at his school.

School shootings are unfortunately prevalent in this country. When one occurs, the nation watches and then proceeds to pass judgment. School shootings are a touchy cinematic subject not often covered on film and never from the perspective of the parents. It is sometimes forgotten or not even thought about that the parents of school shooters are victims too. Parenting, whether good or bad, is not necessarily a catalyst for this kind of thing, yet the parents tend to receive some of the blame and are viewed as an extension of the shooter and disregarded accordingly.

This kind of film is tailor-made for actors. The skeleton of the plot isn't new; a family trying to pick up the pieces after a tragedy. By incorporating a school shooting and the effects this has on the shooter's parents, writers Michael Armbruster and Shawn Ku (who also directs) add another layer of depth and examination to the story rather than sensationalizing it. It's a touchy subject, because filmmakers don't have a lot to explore. There's no definitive answer. We like to blame things, be it bullying or music or video games, but why then do people who are exposed to the same things not react in the same way? It's this sense of the unknown that I think troubles people most and keeps them glued to the screen in these situations. The film is respectful towards the issue and doesn't bite off more than it can chew.

The film follows Bill and Kate, both consumed with their work and leaning towards a future divorce. After facts come to light about their sons actions, they begin trying to cope with the tragedy in the current social networking/mass media world. Soon, they are being badgered by the media and are forced to retreat from their home to attempt to restore things to some sense of normality, while being exposed to the cruelty of people who feel personally wronged and misplace their blame. The script wisely avoids dwelling on Sam or the particulars of the shooting, allowing the actors to embrace the strong emotional content of the story. It is, at its very essence, an actor's piece and both Bello and Sheen deliver. Powerful, startling words are said to each other; something parents should never have to say or experience. Singer Meat Loaf has a few brief scenes as a hotel clerk and there's a scene between him and Sheen that is devastating and brilliantly, quietly acted. It doesn't have the shouting and unbridled emotion of some other scenes, but it's one of the most powerful scenes of the entire film.

The script explores the emotional, but not the psychological. It asks a lot of questions, but makes no attempt to answer them. Like the parents, it has no answers only speculation. The script does nearly everything right, except the subplot involving the new novelist that Kate works with. This reaches a predictable conclusion and isn't unimportant to show what parents may have to deal with, but is ineffective overall. Beautiful Boy is powerful, but not profound. A film that may make you think, but doesn't require you to. It's eye-opening, but not surprising. It's very well-acted and well-meaning, worth the experience but not something that will warrant multiple viewings.

4652178,5,B005CA4SP6,"I saw this amazingly powerful film at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.  It's not a happy film, but it's completely plausible.  Many years ago my neighbors and I had a bar-b-que to which we invited a mortician who lived in the neighborhood and happened to specialize in restoring the faces of people who had been disfigured through violent crimes or suicides.  She's considered one of the premiere experts in her field.  She told us about being hired by the parents of one of the teenage Columbine shooters to restore their son's face (he shot off a good part of it off when he committed suicide at the school).  She talked about how dispassionate or in denial the parents seemed - how the mother was obsessed with her makeup and appearance, and the father was missing in action - he was actually off on a business trip!  It was an eerie experience.  I was very judgmental of those parents based on what we were told.  But all of those feelings were put into a different focus when I saw BEAUTIFUL BOY.  What a child who goes into a school or other public place and kills many people leaves behind for his parents to clean up and try to understand is beyond tragic.  And then there's the matter of all the rest of us blaming the parents - assuming they're terrible people.  But sometimes it's not the parents fault.  Sometimes the parents had no clue - no signs - possibly because they were blinded by love, or they were preoccupied by so many other things in their and their families lives.  Watch this riveting film to see what I mean.  It's a stunning piece of work, regardless of what some critics have said.  A revelation!",1316736000,4,1639,4.5272108843537415

8464971,5,B005CA4SP6,"Excellent movie, well acted. The movie showed how vulnerable we all are, and how alone.  Yet supported by a helpful message: We can help each other. But we have to reach out, it doesn't just happen. We simply are vulnerable to our own inner struggles and thoughts, and need each other.

Youth especially will think they alone are alone, without real friends, with friends that disappoint.  But this is the human condition. Hence we are not alone. This was an awareness and larger concern in the film Beautiful Boy.

The two, the parents, when faced with something major, found they really had no friends. Yet mercy and help came from unexpected places, strangers, acquaintances. This is a common experience.

They were estranged from each other on top of it all. Another common experience.  Yet, yet, yet...  they had to go on living and step by step deal with the difficulties that presented -- emotionally and socially.  And they do.  That is why the movie is good.

They are not heroes.  But by being with them in their journey, we are participating in a compassion that seems impossible. The journey for them will never end, though it will get better at times.  We, however only need spend a couple hours with them. This is time well spent.

The truths and strengths of the movie:
1. maturity -- life is difficult
2. bad things happen and we simply can never understand why
3. guilt is only part of the picture:  We don't have that much control.  But we must face up to our part, yet forgive ourselves as well as others.
4. love is possible no matter how difficult the situation

These two reached out to each other honestly and with real love -- honest vulnerability -- even though much is simply unresolved. True to life.
Their journeys, whether alone or together, will be long ones that can't be patched up with bandaids. Whatever they decide to do, they will survive if they remain open to love.  That is the best any of us can do.",1508025600,,1939,4.590116279069767

This film is very dark, but only because it needs to be in order to tell its story fully and clearly. It is an unflinching look at what a tragic loss and the expanse of grief does to a family: specifically two parents who have just lost their son in an unbelievably devastating act of violence.

<>Major Spoilers below<>

What I think is very daring about this movie (and appropriately so) is that it focuses only on these parents and how they respond, not others. It does not go into how the other families are dealing with their losses in the face of this tragedy---and that is not to say that the parents do not care. They care very, very much; it is because they are so wrapped up in their own grief, and the condemning, needless judgement of others, that they cannot reach out with their condolences (although the husband tries).

In the wake of so many senseless tragedies, including Newton and Columbine and other massacres, this film has come at the most appropriate time, and is very important to see for everyone who cares about the future of our children and those we love.

Through powerful acting and storytelling and a flawless score, you will never forget the courage that these two parents display in the face of loss and grief as they struggle to hold onto each other and themselves.

Please hug your loved ones today and every day, and every moment you can. You never know what the future may hold, and do not take anything you love for granted. <3",1485216000,,1499,4.472527472527473
