5391746,4,B00A705SWS,"The sceneries of the movie well reflect the beauty of love--the movie materializes the abstract concept of love. Thats what i like about this movie. It also touches the historic event at a point of time in Korea, and it works well with the intention of the movie/directer.",1389657600,,272,4.6875
5391747,4,B00A705SWS,This movie was quite leisurely and it took me several tries to get through it. In a way that may have helped since we are following the journey of a man who loses the woman he loves and how he comes to deal with it. In the end I really appreciated the time deliberate pace and how we see the unfolding of grief and healing.,1388966400,,323,3.9846153846153847

5391750,5,B00A705SWS,"For those like me who prefer to have the DVD, this does come with the spoken Korean and the subtitles in English.

I first want it realized that a large part of my interest in this film is that I lived in Seoul when the true tragedy took place.  In 1995, a large department store did cave in and a colleague of mine survived.

With that preface in mind, I would recommend the film to someone who is interested in Korean culture.  Otherwise, it might be difficult for some viewers to get through the exposition of the first 20-30 minutes.

However, once the main character starts his journey to reconnect with the love he lost, I feel most viewers will be drawn in.  I don't want to give away too many spoilers but the young man's journey starts out alone.  He feels solitary in his grief.

It is through following his vacation itinerary that he meets a woman with whom he connects.  Her life intertwines with his in a way neither would have expected.

She also is trying to recover from the department store tragedy but from the perspective of a survivor.  They share a connection in common about that day beyond expectation.

The film shows some of the most beautiful places in South Korea outside the hustle and bustle of the big cities.

The acting and direction are very good.

The film is sad and touching but it does offer the opportunity of hope after an enormous loss for the main characters.  That theme is perhaps a positive message for humanity in general.",1377388800,8,1467,4.503787878787879
5391751,4,B00A705SWS,"Two strangers touched by a tragedy find themselves repeatedly meeting at various scenic spots in Korea. Why? It can't be just co-incidence can it? That's the background of the plot, and the answer is surprisingly satisfying.

There are a lot of reasons to like this movie... it has a happy ending to a sad story... good character development, and the movie highlights some of the most scenic spots in Korea...",1369267200,7,409,4.8428571428571425
5391752,5,B00A705SWS,"I didn't expect this to be as sad as it was. Not all the way through, but in places it was. I don't want to give anything away that might spoil it for anyone, but if you get emotionally involved in movies, you should have some tissues handy for this one.

I'm finding, with these Korean movies, that I prefer the slower, more thoughtful ones, like this one. I've watched others that had characters who were just too jarring and annoying and loud...and for me, I can't stand that. But, none of that in this one.

It might be a little too slow for some, as the story does take awhile to develop, but I found it to be more reflective of real life in that way.

I also thought the subtitles were good, as sometimes I find them confusing or they're not on the screen long enough. I thought these were just right. Of course, the dialogue isn't flying around really fast, so perhaps that's why.  :)  Not that I can't read fast, it's just that with some of them the subtitles fly by so fast that I can't tell what's actually happening.

Anyway, nice quiet movie for a nice quiet afternoon. :)",1366848000,8,1084,4.28921568627451
5391753,4,B00A705SWS,"Just so you guys know, the tragic event in the movie did really happen in early 90's in South Korea. Makes it even more touchy knowing that this movie is somewhat based on a true event! Be sure to prepare lots of Kleenex tissues!",1417910400,2,229,4.2272727272727275

5391756,4,B00A705SWS,"TRACES OF LOVE is a film that is centered around the loss of love due to a tragic death of one of a pair of lovers. Many films have dealt with this but it is the skill of director Dae-seung Kim that stamps this one as extraordinary.  Most cinematic deaths occur as the climactic end after a great deal of weeping by the surviving lover, but here the death occurs fairly early on in a manner that is totally unexpected.  The twin lovers are state prosecutor Choi Hyon-Woo (Ji-Tae Yu) and news reporter Min-Joo (Ji-Su Kim) who plan to marry in one month. Min-Joo goes shopping and while eating in a store caf&eacute;, the entire building suddenly collapses, killing her and many others. This collapse was literally a bolt out of the blue, leaving Hyon-Woo devastated. The ""traces"" of the title is a reference to a book written by Min-Soo which contains the contemplated itinerary of her planned honeymoon. When Hyon-Woo is given possession of the book, he reads it and decides to carry out each day of a five day trip to a lovely national park.

The film takes an unexpectedly melodramatic turn when he meets a seemingly troubled young woman Se-Jin (Ji-Won Uhm) at various steps of the trip. They share a love of the outdoors and little by little she reveals her function in the plot (which I shall not reveal here). The film's focus begins with how Hyon-Woo tries to restore his emotional equilibrium by vicariously living out his non-honeymoon. Then near the end, the focus shifts to Se-Jin and her own untreated angst. There is a natural tendency for the audience to assume that because this is a serious romantic drama that Hyon-Woo would find in Se-Jin a surrogate for his late Min-Joo. Yet, they do no more than wander the park as each supports the other in a manner that flows believably from an earlier scene that details the full story of the building's collapse. TRACES OF LOVE is a heart-rending account of how one tragic event impacts on others. I chose not to give it five stars only because of the heavy hand of coincidence that kept placing Hyon-Woo and Se-Jin in conveniently adjacent locations. Recommended.",1406419200,2,2122,4.683646112600536

5391759,4,B00A705SWS,"This is a subtle and restrained drama but one I think you won't regret watching.  The characters are on a journey of healing.  Although at times it seemed to me like the outcome was predictable, I still enjoyed watching the story unfold.",1394582400,2,237,4.619047619047619
5391760,3,B00A705SWS,"The premise of the movie begins with a man and his fiancee as they prepare for their married life. But this is cut short when she prematurely dies in an earthquake. From there her bereaved fiance begins to travel using her diary. Along the way, he meets another wayward soul who suffers anxiety attacks. Ultimately, we see the strife in both characters' hearts and the peace and tranquility that can be found in life.

The scenery, the music, the slow-pace of the characters, the long silences, all contribute to a peaceful mood that permeates the movie. The acting was also quite well done and the characters did a good job and projecting serenity into every scene. I did not find the movie sad, but rather reflective of the solace that one can find despite the sadness life leaves upon our door steps.

Although I enjoyed the movie, it was (for me) never gripping or touching enough to warrant anything higher than a 3-star rating. In other words, it was a nice movie but not life-changing. And I would recommend it to anyone overcoming some sadness in their life. To paraphrase from the film: ""there is a strength that comes from travelling and seeing the world""~",1393718400,,1166,4.682926829268292

8547600,5,B00A705SWS,"The description of this movie on Amazon would have the viewer believing its all about mourning and a painful path back to normalcy.  It really is not that type of movie. Yes, there is a recap of what sadly happened to his wife, but its the retracing of his wifes diary when she discovered all these amazing rural locations during her work, that makes it interesting.  Especially because there is another person who is making the same journeys for a similar reason. When they meet up, happiness and a greater understanding follows.  Autumn is a time of reflection as the season changesThis movies cinematography and portrayal of the fall season captures that feeling very well.",1512000000,,676,4.860869565217391
8547601,5,B00A705SWS,"I usually can't handle movies about the suffering that comes after the death of a loved one. They strike too close to my own heart. But this movie is about the path beyond grief, by traveling through it, for both main characters. It could have so easily turned maudlin, yet always managed to never reach that line, to never wallow in grief. At the end I was left in a place of sadness mixed with hope, precisely the right place for this story to leave me.

I highly recommend taking the journey this movie offers.",1506556800,2,513,4.4
