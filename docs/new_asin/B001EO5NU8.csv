3556479,3,B001EO5NU8,"I ordered this set and there are so many errors on it, I'm missing the intake, mine just starts at the first session, and like many others on here, mine ends early before the episode is actually over.  I am very disappointed in the company that produced these!!!  Another problem is that they didn't even take the time to edit out the segueways to commercials...you spend alot of time fast forwarding thru the recaps!!  Just so disappointing that it is so poorly put together.  The show was great, the discs are horrible.  Of course I can't return mine because it's been too long so I'm just stuck with it the way that it is...looks like others have the same issues!!!",1241654400,15,668,4.533333333333333

3556481,4,B001EO5NU8,"I have been an alcohol and drug counselor assisting adults and adolescents for years into entering recovery. So I was very excited to hear that ""rehab"" had gone mainstream with the idea and creation of this series.  I will describe the basics that happen in each episode without giving plot spoilers, and tell you my overall opinion of the series and the DVD set at the end.

Disc 1

 Intake is the first episode of the series. We meet the cast of celebrity rehab, which includes Brigette Nielson, Jessica Sierra, Daniel Baldwin, Jaimee Foxworth, Chyna, Seth Binger, Mary Carey, and Jeff Conaway.

 Detox is the second episode, and is primarily about this process of detoxifiying from alcohol and drugs.

 New Arrival is the third episode, and adds Ricky Rodriquez to the bunch.  Issues with rebelliousness and how that relates to recovery are discussed in the episode.

 Disc 2

 Sex and Trauma, episode 4, is discussed as a reason for using drugs and alcohol abusively.  One celebrity leaves rehab.

 Episode 5 is ""Bye Bye Baldwin."" One celebrity is confronted about the use of anabolic steroids outside of treatment, another clebrity's signifigant other brings alcohol into the unit during family visitation. Sober activities are introduced and focused on.

 Episode 6 is entitled ""Friends and Family,"" and emphasizes the need of family members to attend counseling with the addicted clients. Addiction as a family disease is discussed, and how someone who does not have family involvement is likely to relapse.

 Disc 3

 Episode 7 is entitled ""Retreat"" and focuses on clean and sober recreation.  Rebelliousness and inappropriate behavior is discussed and observed on the program.

 Episode 8 is Graduation.  It is observed that some clients are in ""relapse mode,"" and seem to be reverting to old behaviors, and devaluing treatment because in actuality they don't want to leave treatment. A choice is given to the clients-each person can stay in sober living for up to three months, all expenses paid, and they must give their answer to this at the graduation ceremony.

 Disc 4

 Episode 9 ""Graduation II"" Everyone says their goodbyes, and various celebrities decide upon or decline to stay in the sober living environment.

 Episode 10
 Boy, how I wish I could give a review of this complete episode.  A reunion is held of the Celebrity Rehab clients, after a complete profile of what happened to Mary Carey the DVD cut off and went back to the menu page during the segment of what happened to Ricky Rodriguez.  Very disappointing.  So I have no idea what happened to the majority of people who completed celebrity rehab or who stayed sober.

 Overall, the content of this DVD was exactly what you would see at a non-celebrity rehab center.  The group counseling segments and the recreation segments are done in normal inpatient treatment centers. The celebrity clients acted as regular addicted clients do of other inpatient treatment centers, with their sexual acting out, and immature behavior.  Addiction and Alcoholism is not immune to one's class status or wealth.

  However, I am puzzled by few mentions of the Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous groups.  Both of these groups have helped millions of people to recover from addiction.  Yet they are only mentioned in passing during graduation in the ""Graduation II"" episode.  I feel a brief introduction on the importance of these groups, having a sponsor, and working the 12 steps would have been beneficial in one of the episodes of this program.

 Also, the DVD set was poorly put together. ""Intake"" is the first episode, and is listed as the first episode on the back of the DVD.  Yet, it is number three, the last episode, on the DVD.  The last episode of the series, ""Reunion,"" only plays for 14 minutes before it cuts off and goes back to the menu.  I returned one set of DVDS thinking that this problem with the last episode was an isolated incident, however, that is not the case.  The new one I just got from Amazon.com has the same flaw, and another reviewer mentioned the fact that he could not get this episode to play either.

 Also, I would have liked the outtakes and deleted scenes available on this disc as well.",1233878400,18,4204,4.887943262411348
3556482,1,B001EO5NU8,I was very disappointed with this product. The episodes on the first disc were mixed up but the others seemed fine so I ignored it. Weeks later I was almost done watching all the episodes so I threw away my receipt. A few days later I was watching the final episode and found out the disc ends after 14 minutes and does not have the remaining 45 minutes.,1233273600,15,354,4.220588235294118
3556483,1,B001EO5NU8,"This DVD is horribly made.  I was let down to find out this dvd is still censored.  The menu screens are cheaply made, and the episodes button on the main menu screen is called chapters.  The ""play all"" function on the first disc plays the episodes out of order.  The discs appear to be dvd-r's.",1230854400,6,295,4.3090909090909095

8299033,4,B001EO5NU8,I liked this season a lot. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he did give some of the celebrities some special treatment in terms of leeway when they made jokes about drugs which was starkly different from the way he depicted his type of treatment in his book The Mirror Effect. That was a disappointment.,1501459200,,328,4.306451612903226
8299034,1,B001EO5NU8,"Intake wasn't included, I was looking forward to that. Disks aren't copied or put together with the customer in mind. My disks were bouncing around in the case upon arrival. The whole thing isn't worth 30 bucks.",1460160000,,211,4.72972972972973

8299038,1,B001EO5NU8,"Rolling Stone in its latest issue, (cover Larry David, great interview the Dalia Lama), gives a nice Dr. Drew as ""teflon"" overview as we see him cash in on celebrity in his Rehab shows-singularly the most amazing spectacles. They really capture the way it appears by all evident measures known to man to be. Ah the show...Minutes of what will be on after commercials, commercials of what will be on, back to show for re-cap of what was on before commercial and 30 seconds of raging through the darkness with Dr. Drew ever ""caring"". Just one look at his face and a cure is in the works. One can almost practice that ""face of true care"" he makes between shots. I certainly can say-I cannot believe any practicing Dr. would endorse stuff like that as representative of any practice ogf therapy-but-what would I know? (and experiences in my last six years point to my amazing mis perception of their oath) It certainly amazes to see what this ""dedicated practitioner"" did in his dirty dance with Nancy Grace and the cash in on the death of a small child. Is this really ""Do no harm?"" Is making a fortune from displaying others in this way Warholish macabre camp? Can that 15 minutes of fame represent a process towards a happier, better, more sane , less destructive meaningful life?
After watching every film clip on his multiple webpages about just the Casey Anthony case I can sincerely state his contribution to the field of gossip-driven-practicing-narcissistic-celebrity-conjecture is unparalleled.
""I feel your pain"" -well all the way to end of the minute one would hope, but I don't count on it.
And I have to add that the Rolling Stone neglected to mention the shots with the horses on Rehab-by far the best 20 seconds you'll spend as cleaning a hoof rewires all the fear and intense abuse of a lifetime, complete with styling gear, a knotty old man Yoda cowpoke and Dr. Drew in absentia. With 20 seconds like that you just know the synapses have laid the foundation for a lifetime of trust. Giddayup.

""It is a labor of love, and I applaud his effort.""  one reviewer writes of a Drew book. Admittedly far earlier than this latest spat of products hit the market.

I watched him trashing facts and riling emotions in his way through his appearances on Nancy Grace.
I find it hard to call that ""a love effort."" It seemed so clearly about his cultivation of a fortune, with his TV fame on the side. I really think he ought to go and spend 5 to 25 years working at underperforming schools with kids in poverty-he now has the income to take the hit, and make a difference in a communities life. Pasadena I'm sure could use that from what I've seen in its beautiful divisions. Then, maybe, write about it, possibly on a blog, or in conversations where he pours out his soul to another person. Might not be as slick as his site now.
That, my friend, might be called ""a labor of love.""

SOME may believe ""he cares"" and others may see that as ""service"" but if you look at the life he's leading..I enjoyed his Tweets on flying back and forth to European holiday during the rough days of Anthony appearances and the wife's tweets of her global roaming....yeah, that's a lot of ""care"" he's dealing with.
It's hard to argue he's doing much more than building wealth and ""on the backs of others"" to unimaginable heights for his profession. Rolling Stone had no problem parsing it- if you do.  Of course, when you read about those Harvard psychiatrists with the 4.2 million payout from big pharm, perhaps he's just refining the art of whatever it is they do. I just cannot separate his actions from his caring dialog.

I'll pass.",1311638400,3,3620,4.595975232198143
8299039,4,B001EO5NU8,"ok as long as you are a fan of the celebrity rehab shows (and sober house) you will love this dvd. i purchased season 1 for myself and a second one for a close friend as a gift.we are constantly in contact with each other discussing the shows when they are on. it kicks out all the comercials and you just flow with the show. i am a big fan of dr drew and the intensity of his show seems a bit deeper on the dvd.either there are scenes i missed on or they added for the dvd. the only thing i do notice is that what is bleeped out on the televised show is still bleeped out in the dvd. i would think the bleeping would have been eliminated, oh well, that is the only reason i give it 4 stars.i did try to do 4 1/2 but it wouldn't let me do it. but it is still worth investing in. 1) if you are a big fan and 2) if you are in school studying addictions (yes, for me it does help a bit in some of my psyche classes).
i should be buying season 2 shortly. and don't fortget some of the patients are definatly interesting and do pull at your hearts.",1275696000,8,1043,3.855813953488372
8299040,3,B001EO5NU8,"As a mental health professional and medical educator, I purchased this DVD to show students and psychiatry residents what goes on in a rehab program following didactic lectures on the topic.  Having worked in this type of setting in the past, I am familiar with treatment programs for addictions.  Dr. Drew Pinsky is board certified in Internal Medicine and fellowship trained/boarded in Addiction Medicine. He is a professional and clearly shows compassion for his patients who struggle with addictions. He also sets limits and maintains boundaries. However, the people who made the DVD created a hodgepodge of segments that jump around, repeat and it is difficult to show the continuity of care and progress that some of the people make during treatment. I would not purchase this DVD until the producers find a way to make it less chaotic. Perhaps Season II will be better?",1254441600,11,876,5.0344827586206895
8299041,5,B001EO5NU8,it was a show i seen on pay so i got season one to watch it from start to finish it is a bit funny at times but if you know sum one with a drug or drink problem it would be worth watching so you had a bit of a insight into what goes threw their mind and the fight we have to stay sober.,1246752000,2,286,3.3484848484848486
8299042,5,B001EO5NU8,"I loved this show on TV and wanted to share it with a friend who I thought could benefit from it.  The show was great, but the DVD was the most low budget package I have ever seen.  There are no explanations anywhere on the DVD, the episodes were not set up cohesively (at least on the DVD's I got), the listing of the shows were not accurate and there was NO close captioning.

I only hope when the next season is released they will put a little more thought into it.  It seems like whoever put this together could use a little rehab of their own.",1245974400,5,548,4.093457943925234
