3762121,5,B001PWY4U4,I couldn't agree more with what's been said. This show is such a hidden gem I'm so glad I've found! I want to have it all at my fingertips whenever I need a pick-me-up. This show is so beyond good on so many levels! Brynn is hilarious! Nessa is a crack up. They're all such well rounded characters and good people. It's a real shame that there are only two seasons. There should be more. I wish there was! As soon as the two seasons become available I will definitely scoop them right up.,1227571200,3,488,4.202127659574468
3762122,5,B001PWY4U4,Brilliant rendition of Essex and Welsh lifestyle. Best British comedy since The Office. Ness and Smitty - what a lovely couple. Please put this on American DVD.,1227312000,,160,4.962962962962963

3762127,5,B001PWY4U4,"What a treat. This series lives up to the glowing reviews that others have given it. We enjoyed it so much we bought the second and third season the same day we started the first one. The characters are refreshingly different and believable and the writing is wonderfully comedic.
This will give you a delightful look at James Corden's work (he is one of the writers as well as an actor) before he came to the US. The whole ensemble of quirky characters work well together and are sure to amuse a wide range of viewers.",1474243200,,519,4.416666666666667

3762171,4,B001PWY4U4,"Very cute show. Things that I would think are too crude in American TV take on a kind of laughable hilarity when Welsh, English, and even Australian accents are added to the mix. Story of a couple from two different cultural backgrounds (Wales, England) and how their family and friends get along, don't get along, party together, fight each other, and create a kind of bizarro one-big-happy-family. Have to laugh every time Nessa says ""What's occuring"" and ""Fair Play"", although they are just regular conversation and not even a punchline. Don't think a show in America could get away with naming a character ""Chinese"" Alan, (due to his delivery job and not his ethnicity), or even ""Big Fat Sue"". Very funny writing on the part of the show creators, James Corden (who plays Smithy) and Ruth Joans (who plays Nessa). Stellar supporting cast who make me want to watch other shows they have been in.",1420761600,,897,4.7935483870967746

3762191,3,B001PWY4U4,"I watched Stella (UK) series on Hulu first, and I think it's loads better than this series. Much funnier and heartwarming, with a bit of an edge, and the characters are, hello, actually likable, which is a novelty these days. I'd heard the buzz about Gavin & Stacey, but I agree with some of the other reviews--a lot of modern TV and movies rely too much on cynical, world-weary vulgarity, and it gets just as boring as the squeaky clean totally unrealistic approach does. Then shows jump the shark, and it's all down hill from there. Gavin & Stacey has its moments--mostly Nessa (tho over the top x 3 is enough already), but Pam is good too. Tired of the cynicism and vulgarity--that's a cop out for good writing--and Ruth Jones IS a STELLAr writer. For my money, watch Stella--it jumps the shark occasionally over the past three seasons, but still manages to really hit the mark, with plenty of  laughs, ups and downs, and touching moments.",1418947200,,942,4.640718562874252
3762192,5,B001PWY4U4,"A terrific series by one of Britain's smartest comedians, James Corden, about love, friendship and the peculiarities of Britain. Fans of ""The Office"" (U.K. and U.S. versions) will be happy to discover Gavin and Stacey. English and Welsh accents are thick in places, but that's part of the fun in watching. Some content not appropriate for young kids.",1418947200,,350,5.051724137931035
3762193,1,B001PWY4U4,Way too sexual and crude.,1418860800,,25,4.2
3762194,5,B001PWY4U4,This is such a funny series. It's also a great opportunity to see James Corden before he became so popular. This is British humour at its very best - up there with the IT Crowd!,1418083200,,177,4.085714285714285

3762209,5,B001PWY4U4,"I loved this show, particularly the ways in which people are drawn together through their relationships with others. I really enjoyed this British show, specifically the ways in which the creators (actor & actress for the characters of Vanessa & Smithey) capture daily human moments. I was surprised by how fast their relationship developed in each episode. I wish that it lasted longer than three seasons. Just like the British version of ""the Office"" was adapted into American television, I see remnants and aspects of this show in some American television shows on the air. All in all this was a great show, with fantastic writing and acting which is why I gave it five stars. Anyways, I hope these writers create another Britcom, that was as well done as this one.",1417219200,,768,4.825757575757576

I started watching this to become more familiar with James Corden as he's taking over for my beloved Craig Ferguson at the Late Late Show. I'd only ever known of James as Craig from Doctor Who. I was pleasantly surprised at the writing and the show as a whole. Not only is it hilarious, but it has a lot of warmth and it made me tear up a few times. Sweet. I only wish there'd been more than 3 seasons.",1412380800,,459,3.893617021276596

3762230,5,B001PWY4U4,"How can you not love this show? I watched the first season which progresses the relationship from their first meeting in Leicester Square in London, England. Gavin is from Essex, a London suburb, and Stacey is from Barry Island, Wales. They comes from two different cultures in the same country. They bring their families and friends together as well.

The cast is marvelous and the writing is witty and fresh as well as believable and realistic. I picked this DVD up somewhere. I don't know why I waited so long to finally watch it but it is delightful. I love the friends like Nessa and Smithy who hook up in London too. The actors who play those roles are the creators and writers of this series.

Like most British sitcoms, they are too short without about 6-8 episodes a season. I enjoyed Larry Lamb and Alison Steadman OBE as Gavin's parents. Melanie Walters plays Stacey's lovable Welsh mother. The behind the scenes and the making of the show displays the relationships among the cast and crew.",1410134400,,1002,4.6875
3762231,5,B001PWY4U4,"LOVE this show!  Love it that a main (and super sexy) character is a larger woman. The Brits are much more realistic than Hollywood in that regard.  Nessa's character is just as cool and lovable as Stacy - but for different reasons.  The only character I'm not that fond of is Smithy - he's pretty misogynist, and such a whiner!  The actor is great, but the writers could make him a lot more appealing by having him grow up a bit and open his eyes to the real world.

I like the parents, too.  Gavin's dad is about the sanest character, so he gives a good balance, and one can see where Gavin - who is also a really lovable character - gets his calm reason.  Altogether a great show.  Wish there were more episodes!",1409011200,,715,4.2444444444444445

The typical British wry sense of humor is in top form here as the shows follows it's two love birds - long distance phones mates for six months before actually seeing each other in the flesh - through their dealings with best freinds and family as they try to navigate a precarious path to marriage. Allison Steadman (The Singing Detective) is particularily good offering a stacatto laugh, some geat lines and ample cleavage, much admired by Gavin's mate Smithy. It's cute and quirky at the same time.",1403913600,,618,4.731481481481482

As the show progresses the story takes a major leap away from Gavin and Stacey (which is okay, as you start to care very little about them), and you become sooo much more interested in Smithy and Nessa.
It is a great show!

The actor playing Smithy is someone I have enjoyed in The History Boys and Doctor Who, so he is a welcome addition to the endearing couple of the title.  Gavin and Stacey meet on the phone at their respective places of work, then progress to a long distance relationship with lots of driving on Gavin's part from Essex to Wales.

It would be great if the written word was added as a crawl for those of us colonists who are not dialecticians. The stars of the show are diminished by the superior quality of the supporting cast.

With a strong ensemble cast that includes writing team Ruth Jones and James Corden, both of whom get more than their fair share of hilarious lines, the show mines comedy gold in the mundane and ridiculous details of the characters' lives. Be aware: there is lots of adult content to offend the prudish, but it adds up to an entertaining, even endearing experience.",1393891200,,460,4.7625

When Gavin (from Essex) and Stacey (from Wales) finally meet after knowing each other through through work conversations, sparks fly--well, more than fly.  And when their best friends Nessa and Richie (who have come along to protect Gavin and Stacey for their first in-person meeting) also meet,  there's another great connection, but this one is of mutual lust and loathing.  With an incredible ensemble cast of their family members and friends, the path of love is complicated by geography, personal histories, and some funny sub-plots within their families.  There are is a lot of openness about sex among all the characters of all ages, if that bothers you, but it is funnier than racy which I'm sure is the point.  Created about 2008, it's fun to see that generation of devices used, like early GPS systems.  I watch it with captions on since I'm an American not often exposed to a Welsh accent and there are sometimes some pretty fast dialogue exchanges.

But to be honest Joanna Page truly drew me emotionally into the show. She has to be one of the best actresses I have seen; she had me believing she was madly in love with Gavin.  Her excitement great smile brought back memories of thrill of collage years. However, it also made me sad, I watched every episode but I wanted more.

  I do marriage counseling (I am preacher) another thing I though was very good was how they dealt with the problems of life that do come up. I think it would be good for young people to watch it to become aware of the problems that come upon a marriage.

After about the third episode, I came to love these characters.  Though named Gavin and Stacy, the supporting cast are even more of the gems.  I love the uncle, played by Rob Brydon and the way Brits laugh at the Welsh.

3762376,5,B001PWY4U4,"Every season of Gavin and Stacey is fabulous. Begin watching season 1 and expect that you won't be able to resist watching seasons 2 and 3. Not since the best addictive television comedies like Seinfeld and Cheers before it, has there been such a show worthy of a dedicated following--and sadly America doesn't even know about it. I just happened upon Gavin and Stacey and after a couple shows, I watched all 3 seasons of it in 3 days. The best aspect of this show is that there are truly talented actors who wholly inhabit their characters.  An annoying, off-putting, characteristic of any show for me, particularly a comedy, is when an actor is constantly aware of what he's doing--the audience is watching him act.  His/her, ego is on full display completely thrilled at this opportunity to strut his stuff in a show.  That doesn't happen in Gavin and Stacey.  Some of these characters are over the top, and you believe them, even love them for their idiosyncrasies.  Gavin and Stacey are two very nice people, who you might know.  They are genuine and sweet and innocently funny.  The characters that surround them--their families and friends--are straight-up crazy, funny, flawed, sweet, loving, honest people--just like your aunts, uncles and friends.  Pam, Gavin's mom, so mom-ish--loving her ""prince"" of a son, sexy with her husband, sometimes trying to be who she isn't, giving and selfish, fussy and warm--is simply funny.  Smithy, Gavin's best friend, is somewhat rotund, cutting back on his eating with a 6-pack of chicken, corn on the cob and other sides, at the end of a night of partying; always greets Gavin with a shared hip-hop song and choreography--with Gav's mom and dad joining in when they're around--quite capably, I might add; rolling on the floor in a tussle with his younger sister--another hip-hop master; and, an all-round hysterically funny good guy!  Brin, Stacey's uncle, is embodied by Rob Brydon, from The Trip...OMG, I adore him... Brin lingers just a moment too long when he hugs Gav, and he is harboring some secret experience...that happened on a fishing trip with his nephew, Stacey's brother...it was very cold on that trip... And, last but certainly not least, is Nessa, Stacey's best friend.  Nessa is a hearty (like Smithy) Welsh lady, who is completely blunt in her honest, slightly stilted, take on the world.  She can assist her bouncer friends at the local night club, and go head-to-head with Smithy on a KFC mega meal, where a butter-dripping ear of corn becomes an unexpected bit of foreplay.  An American audience might take an extra second to get used to the British and Welsh accents and allusions...but please, give it a minute...Nobody speaks Welsh in Wales and their accents become just another great joke.  The only negative about this comedy is that there are not 5 more seasons to hang out with these people.  This is a great, funny and very warm ensemble show.",1366761600,4,2920,4.894523326572008

Welsh lass falls for English boy -- and from there it's all about the social differences, the blending of the families, and at the route of it the ups and downs of romance. Written by the fab Ruth Jones (Nessa) and James Corden (Smithy) who also have strong roles in the show.
Each character is well developed, all with their special little quirks. LOVE Ruth Jones in this. TIDY!  Just a shame it ended with season three, innit?",1363996800,,494,4.428571428571429

3762396,5,B001PWY4U4,"Watch Gavin and Stacey because it is totally funny, charming, and clever. The story revolves around the two main characters (Gavin and Stacey) and their best friends (Smithy and Nessa). The series is about friendship and about building families. The story starts where many romantic comedies end: Gavin and Stacey decide to marry early in the first season. I liked this series because the characters, in the main, have good relationships with each other. The families are generally not dysfunctional, mixed up, or crazy. The characters care about each other and treat each other well, and yet remain interesting. Mostly, the show is not vulgar. This is kind of unusual and refreshing in this day and age. It shows that a series can be successful on the basis of clever development of the characters and story lines, without resorting to violence, excessive sexual innuendo, or just plain crudeness.",1360454400,,898,5.074324324324325

I have always said its not the main character that make a movie or show its the character actors and it just so happens the the two main side characters in this show are the writers. They steal the show. I take that back, all the side characters steal the show, they are so unique and have carved out well defined parts that you want to jump in and be part of the fun. If you know the Welsh and the English have a dislike for each other, sort of like the french and well everyone else I suppose, you will have a better understanding. Once your in you'll be hooked and after the 3rd season it ends. No more series on the horizon, although they are constantly badgered about this. This is perfectly english, and my mother is perfectly Welsh, and I say jump in and enjoy it!",1353715200,,863,4.142857142857143

3762401,2,B001PWY4U4,BBC is no longer about producing quality. Now it's about being trendy and that means having everyone in this show drink like a sot and rut like a hog in estrus. Bloody hell! Are they so terrified of overestimating their audience that that everyone must be the same?,1344124800,,265,4.541666666666667
3762402,5,B001PWY4U4,"Snappy writing, keen directing, and an immaculate cast with bags and bags of charm make this some of the best romantic comedy or any comedy on TV in recent years. For viewers either little or not at all acquainted with the Welsh, it should be an extra treat. Stand-up and sketch comedy lad Matthew Horne (The Catherine Tate Show) gets to stretch his acting legs and does a fine job, and Joanna Page is adorable. While they carry their roles as well as could possibly be asked, the killer charm comes from the supporting cast.

Gavin's best mate Smithy (or rather ""Smiffy"", co-creator James Corden) and Stacey's ""Nessa"" (co-creator Ruth Jones) are perfect complementary counterparts to Gav & Stace. Gavin's parents Mick and Pam (Larry Lamb and Alison Steadman) are one of the most charming mum and dad couples ever, and Stacey's immediate family, her mother Gwen (the fetching Melanie Walters) and uncle Bryn (a near show-stealing performance from Rob Brydon) complete the core ensemble smashingly. Even more peripheral characters keep up the tone and quality set by the main group, like the dead-sexy and talented Sheridan Smith as Smithy's sister, and the gorgeous and entertaining Julia Davis as Pam's friend.

Many a great cast, however, has fallen flat due to a bland or cliched script. ""Gavin & Stacey"", however, is a spectacle of original characters, smart writing, and direction that knows when to be subtle and when to put the hammer down.

This filmed, non-laugh track sitcom runs a very crisp three seasons/series and one Christmas special. Fans have clamored for more, but the creators are holding firm that it's run its course. As much as I'd like more of it, I was pleasantly surprised at how well they wrapped up the show without it seeming too pat.

Forget the forced humor of shows like the American ""Modern Family"" or the painfully tired format of shows like ""Big Bang Theory"" (sorry, only American examples are coming to mind, probably since, as an American, that's what I see most of), ""Gavin & Stacey"" is an adept blend of familiarity and originality, sensibleness and quirkiness that makes it seem more cinematic than small screen, and an utter treat from beginning to end.",1334275200,7,2194,4.90566037735849
3762403,5,B001PWY4U4,"This is a character based comedy in-which every character is very unique, outlandish yet very believable. The acting and timing is perfect. Slightly dry, slightly sweet, slightly slap-stick but again very unique. Their formula works and you'll find yourself liking all of these characters!",1328313600,5,289,5.590909090909091
3762404,5,B001PWY4U4,"I watched season one on Netflix while I was waiting for the gas man to arrive.  No commercial breaks, each episode lasted about 28 minutes.  Awesome.  There's at least one rib splitting laugh in each episode.  I love hearing the cockney and welsh accents.  They add to the flavor of the show.  Nessa rocks!  She doesn't care and yet cares too much if you know what I mean.  I know a lot of people just like her.  I think other comments on here are right, you can relate to a character or situation in the show.  A couple meet up, fall in love, get married, and their best friends get involved.  Now I'm waiting on season two on Netflix  :o)",1317686400,,640,4.241666666666666
3762405,5,B001PWY4U4,"okay okay i think its english, not welsh.  but still, its a great look into the differences and animosities (and similarities) between England and Wales.  the cast is FANTASTIC - the writing is even better (written by the 2 ""sidekicks"" Ruth Jones and James Corden).  solid british comedy, a bit less dry and a bit more romantic than something like Pulling or Peep Show, but definitely not as ""rom com"" as Coupling.  I watch this one over and over.

And I had to write a review because the previous reviewer seemed to mis-rate based on their evaluation... it seemed like they should have given 4 stars for what they wrote, but only gave three.  this is at least a 4 star show, as I think the comments of even that review reflect.

enjoy!",1303516800,9,736,4.488721804511278
3762406,4,B001PWY4U4,"At first, I wasn't sure if this was a comedy or a drama and I barely understood their accents and slang.  I stayed with the show though and my time was rewarded.  Not only does ""Gavin and Stacey"" get easier to understand but it quickly reveals itself as a very funny, sweet, and unique series.

All the characters are interesting and multi-faceted with the best being Gavin's mom and Stacey's uncle.  While the show is titled ""Gavin and Stacey"" and revolves around their relationship, the real drama comes from their respective best friends, Smithy and Nessa.  If you ask me the show is really about Smithy and Nessa's relationship.

Series one highlights include the great shots of the English countryside and London in episode one and Matt Lucas' appearance in episode four.",1302652800,3,776,4.840909090909091
3762407,5,B001PWY4U4,"This is a brilliant show, well written! Some of the British pop culture references went over my American head, but still found the show hilarious. Watched the first ep and just couldn't stop watching, now I'm already on the last ep of the season! So glad there are a couple more seasons to watch.  This free video streaming for Amazon Prime members is fantastic!",1302134400,2,362,4.65625

3762409,5,B001PWY4U4,"It's difficult to relate just how much I love this show. Suffice to say that, since buying all three seasons, barely anything else has been in my DVD player - and I can barely believe myself when I start watching it all over again but never regret it. It's that good.

Alison Steadman is at her glorious best but she's only one part of a truly superb cast.

The stars of the show are not the characters Gavin or Stacey but rather Smithie (James Corden as Gavin's best friend) and Pam (Steadman as Gavin's mom) followed closely by Bryn (played by the genius that is Rob Brydon).

The basic story is about Gavin and Stacey getting together but that's just a vehicle for the other wonderful story-lines and characters that weave in and out of the show. The writing (by Ruth Jones and James Corden who play Smithie and Nessa) is fast paced and lean. So much is packed in and each episode is a perfect blend of real life situations, hysterical, melodramatic drama and flat out comedy.

If you enjoy the lighter Mike Leigh movies such as 'Life Is Sweet' and don't have a hard time understanding English / Welsh accents (there are no subtitles) then you will not regret buying 'Gavin and Stacey. It's simply outstanding.",1288224000,7,1213,4.5504587155963305

I'm as old as Doris and may not be here too much longer, and will be really upset if I shuffle off this mortal coil before I get to see them. For us poor colonists who broke away from the Motherland, to live in a country that produces nothing of any worth, either on television (Boob Tube came from what the U.S. did with it), or in film, please release the other seasons.  I never thought I'd see anything I loved as much as The Office (Ricky Gervais was King), but Ruth Jones and James Corden are the heirs apparent to the throne, and may have already usurped it.  I'll tell you this for nothing, Anrhega 'i ata anad Gwna myfi argywedd.  And I'm not kidding.",1284076800,3,723,4.325925925925926

They do sell the other seasons on the UK Amazon, so you may be able to buy it that way. I was lucky to have my in-laws bring the others over when they visited. And, since it's a different region, I just watch it on my computer. I really hope they make another season as well. Until then, I'll just watch these episodes over and over!",1279238400,,447,4.270588235294118

They love each other, yet argue when Gavin's mom has a little too much to drink, which is about every family get together.  Gavin's dad knows how to reason with her and woos her over with his romantic advances pretending he's Prince Charles!  The fights are funny and in the end sweet and everyone moves on.  Who wouldn't want an uncle like Bryn and a mom like Stacey's Gwen.  And of course, the loyal far out friends Smithy and Vanessa!  O...what's occurin'?",1275091200,,575,4.471153846153846
3762413,5,B001PWY4U4,Please watch Gavin and Stacey.  I have even introduced it to my rather conservative American parents-in-law - and... despite a bit of Welsh slang translation and a rather awkward conversation about whether all Brits are so morally loose; they too fell in love with these delightful characters.,1263772800,,293,5.23404255319149

I ordered the Series 1 DVD set on Monday and it arrived yesterday (Wednesday). After work, my husband and I popped it into the DVD and watched the entire DVD from start to finish. This program is absolutely, laugh-out-loud brilliant! There is ""something for everyone"" of all age groups. It's funny, poignant, tender, tough - and all to easy to relate to on many levels. Can't wait for Season 2 to be released here in the U.S.",1263427200,,616,4.460176991150442

Especially if you've lived there.",1259020800,,298,4.155172413793103

3762420,5,B001PWY4U4,"If you're a fan of the British show"" The Office"",  which I consider one of the best ""sit coms"" ever made, than you will love ""Gavin and Stacey."" I will go on record and say it's just as good as ""The Office."". If you liked the romance of  Tim and Dawn (or Jim and Pam in the U.S. version) , than this is the show for you. While ""The Office"" humor was rooted in the uncomfortableness of life, this show is rooted in pure charm. Most importantly, it's laugh out loud funny. Like ""The Office"", ""Gavin and Stacey""  has great re-watch value and has tons of quotable lines.

Created by James Cordon and Ruth Jones (who play Smithy and Vanessa), ""Gavin and Stacey"" is all about brilliantly written characters. They are all the kind you would love to have as close friends or as relatives. As great as the writing is, the acting is just as fantastic. Everyone creating full 3 dimensional characters that deserve to be up there on the top lists of great TV characters.

The show is such a delicious treat, that I hope everyone gives it a shot and you can thank me later. I've been pimping this show to every person I come in contact with. If you don't find the show utterly charming, than you have have no soul and I pity you. OK, that's a bit harsh, but I know you will be because I'm a tough critic about stuff and this show won me over on just one episode. I anxiously await the release of the 2nd season and the Christmas Special here in America...so get crackin' BBC.",1242086400,5,1462,4.282608695652174
