5958238,5,B00EZ8D46A,"FRONTLINE: League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis is an amazing story of what these athletes live with when they are out of the NFL.  This investigative report is based on a book by Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wadu.  The report shows how the  National Football League has tried for 20 years to avoid confronting the issue of head injuries.  They have tried to not even acknowledge any link between this most violent contact sport and brain injury.  This report shows their is a link and its definitive.  This DVD version of the Frontline investigative report is directed Michael Kirk.

The investigative report shows one, thousands of former NFL players may have received false reassurance that their sport was safe.  And second, millions of parents have received no official warning that signing their kids up for Pee Wee or Midget football could put them at risk for brain injury.  Frontline shows that all the money and power of the NFL can't keep the truth from eventually coming out, as it did with Big Tobacco.

I enjoyed this investigative report from PBS's Frontline and I think you will too.

Thank you for reading my review.",1389312000,2,1144,4.845360824742268
5958239,5,B00EZ8D46A,"Haven't got time to read the book of the same name? This two hour PBS documentary is every bit as good or better. It's fairly current, culminating with September's $765 million settlement in a class action lawsuit brought against the NFL by 4500 brain-damaged retired players. And definitely graphic, with game clips showcasing some fierce contact cut between noir outdoor shots and closed door conference room sessions. It made quite a contrast.

Past the stark violence of the game clips, less sensitive viewers will enjoy following the construction of the case against the League for its reluctance to move on the growing evidence that football-related trauma carries a strong risk of negative long term health consequences.

The majority of viewers will root for the handful of doctors and activists who risked the League's wrath by pushing forward with brain trauma research. That would lead to the discovery of an Alzheimer's-mimicking degenerative disease dubbed Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. CTE research is in its infancy; but with autopsies of 45 out of 46 former NFL players revealing evidence of it as the film wrapped, the early returns are cause for extreme concern.

Referring to the September settlement, Hall of Fame ex-player Harry Carson delivers the takeaway message near the end of this presentation. ""The League has given everybody 765 million reasons why you don't want to play football,"" he says, clearly speaking to parents of pre-adult boys.

Ah. There could be no happy ending here, but at least we got a proper one.",1385078400,9,1547,5.176

5958241,5,B00EZ8D46A,"In my opinion this is an excellent expose of the damage done to the brain from concussions caused by the sport/big business of football, and long overdue.  My question is, what effect is it going to have on the sport and the support of the game by American citizens?",1382400000,5,266,4.428571428571429
5958242,5,B00EZ8D46A,"I saw the Frontline documentary first and that's what led me to the book.  The Frontline story was compelling; the book is an eye-opener.  I couldn't put it down.  Granted I'm a die-hard football fan who's all about the Steelers (particularly the 1970's to mid-80's), the Forty-Niners led by Joe Montana and Steve Young, and the John Madden era Oakland Raiders.  I love the big men and I enjoy the battles on the field, but I also want them all to be as safe as possible.  Yes, football is the most aggressive of contact sports, there's no getting around the brutality of the game.  But the heartlessness of its executives in denying that head injuries are not only serious, but can be fatal just makes me sick.  I hope that these decision-makers admit the dangers inherent that players face and take both medical and financial care of ALL the guys - past, present and future.  There's no excuse not to do so.  They've got the money - share the wealth in a positive, needed way.",1440460800,5,978,4.542857142857143
5958243,5,B00EZ8D46A,"I just finished watching League of Denial on Netflix even though I already knew about it. But I wasn't really paying attention to the issue until now. Listening to the documentary for two hours really opened up my eyes in terms of how bad it was.

I've been a fan of NFL for nearly 30 years; it's just a way of life for me watching the game. I wouldn't say that I am obsessed with it but  appreciate the game. However, the last several years, my interest have waned to the point of quitting watching the game. The final straw was last year based on how the NFL handled the domestic violence issue. The Ray Rice thing was the tipping point that I lost interest.

The reason why the information is so new to me at this day and age because the NFL has done an excellent job of hiding the information from the public. All of the ugly side that goes on behind the scenes have been perfectly concealed. It's not just the domestic violence but the brain injuries, steroids, and performance enhancing drugs. What the fans see on TV is an illusion because they never see what goes on behind the curtains.

I've stopped watching college football over 15 years ago because I've understood the corruption of the game that had steeped into the foundation of academic institutions. Universities and colleges are meant to provide education and training for people who wish to advance their positions in society. But football players are held to a different standard and are not treated the same way as the general public. Placed on a pedestal, they are viewed as moneymakers, plain and simple. Most of them do not belong in college because they cannot read, write, and do math above 4th grade level. It's shocking to me how many of them are considered as student athletes given the fact that they spend so much time to the game because I don't know how they have the energy to keep up with their studies. It's also shocking to me that the highest paid employee on campus is often the football coach along with his assistant coaches being among the highest paid employees.

The point above that I have made is relevant. It's all about the big bucks. Corporations are guilty of this, and NFL is a multi-billion dollar corporation. So are the universities. Their revenue through ticket sales, merchandise, and advertising is dependent on the players because they are the ones who are doing all of the hard work and paying the price with their bodies and minds.

They will do whatever it takes to reach the top, even if it means shaving years of their life in sort of a Faustian deal. That means taking short cuts through illegal drugs including steroids and HGH to get bigger, faster, and stronger. This leads to an increase in speed, power, and force which lead to higher rates of injuries. The illusion these players have created has set the stage for everybody else to follow starting at the bottom through Pop Warner and up to High School, College, and Professional ranks.

Take a look at a list of star players injured in any year the last 3 years. Notice how extensive the list is along with the nature of their injuries. What's shocking to me is how fast these players recover from their injuries. Only illegal drugs can make it happen because these injuries take a very long time for normal people to recover from.

What I hadn't noticed about brain injuries until I saw the documentary is how they can be small in which the players repeatedly go up against others over a prolonged period of time. They all add up like pebbles until it turns into a desert. By the time it does, it's too late. The brain injury has become permanent, and there is no way of undoing it. Moreover, there is absolutely no way of making the game safer other than abstinence. In fact, there is no such thing as a safe helmet.

The reason why the information about brain injuries, concussions, and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) has been hidden from the public for so long is because NFL controls the major networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, and ESPN. They are recipients of billion of dollars that are funneled through advertising. When everybody is making money, nobody wants to tell the truth about the dangers of playing in NFL. If they do a report on it, they aren't banging the drum as loudly as they should, and most likely they have to ask for permission from the NFL before it goes out on air. That's why ESPN is selectively blind about all of the issues about the NFL players. Its investigative journalism is a damn joke by any standard, and there are no ethics whatsoever. That's why NFL has done a very good job of hiding the truth from the public about brain injuries, concussions, CTEs, domestic violence, steroids, HGH, PEDs among other issues.

Roger Goodell is one of the worst people alive. When he talks, he lies. That's what he does for a living. Let me rephrase that: he lies for a living. He is just a money worshipper and works for money worshippers which are the owners of 32 NFL teams. His henchmen are also money worshippers and will do anything to protect the game. Roger talks about the integrity of the game. The irony of it is that NFL has lost integrity many years ago. The game is based on lies and has been so for many years through smoke and mirrors. Writers (most of them are hacks) for many sites such as CBS Sports, ESPN, Sporting News, Fox Sports, ProFootballTalk, etc. have been paid directly or indirectly by the NFL to protect the ""shield"" by glamorizing the teams and their athletes to shift the public's attention away from the real issues. A very good example is Adrian Peterson who was convicted of child abuse yet all they can talk about is how good he will be on the field and how will he help his team. It's just absolutely sickening. The fans of the game are also at blame for ignoring the critical issues by turning a blind eye to them. At best, the league of denial is threefold: NFL, the media, and the fans.

All in all, to boycott football is to stop watching for good.",1432339200,,5991,4.532839962997225
5958244,5,B00EZ8D46A,Great documentary and it really opened my eyes about the NFL and how they have gotten so out of control and damaged so many lives with no accountability at all. Simply because people like and love the game they will allow anything to happen and the NFL does the same simply because it makes so much money from us the fans. Great job FRONTLINE.,1424995200,2,343,4.375
5958245,5,B00EZ8D46A,"I watched this program originally on PBS, and while I don't follow football (I just watch with my boyfriend and watch the superbowl) this caught my interest.  It provides an in-depth look at the issue of players being affected by concussions in the NFL and the consequences of the brain injuries sustained from football in general - from pee-wee league to high school and college levels. This documentary was very informative.",1421366400,,426,5.0

Certainly, I would have been devastated if my parents had said that to me, but then we didn't know what we know now.",1395100800,7,280,4.264150943396227
5958249,5,B00EZ8D46A,"Best way to approach ""League of Denial"" is first to read the book, and then watch the DVD.  Together they are as jarring as the myriad sub-concussive hits that conspire to leave athletes in high-impact sports with brains spilling over with deadly plaque.  Think about the long-term implications of the problem, so adamantly denied by scientists who sanctify their research under the aegis of the NFL, and you'll understand the authors' thesis that if 10% of the mothers in this country understood the stats of this pernicious culture that it would signal the end of football as we know and worship it today in America.

5958250,5,B00EZ8D46A,This was an excellent documentary.  Reinforces that sports is all about money and not about the individual player only as he can best serve them (the NFL).  Here's hoping that all the players who received lifelong sustaining injuries get some compensation!!,1393891200,2,257,5.2439024390243905
5958251,4,B00EZ8D46A,"Here's the funny thing about this documentary, the obvious goal is to convince everyone that playing in the NFL causes brain damage.  But, what it really does is strengthen the NFL's previous stance that, ""...it's unknown if the NFL ""causes"" the problems"".  This video has brains from 18 & 21 year olds that already have CTE, kids that have never played in the NFL... therefore, they're proving that it's more than likely that all or most players that make it to the NFL and eventually test positive for CTE, had already started to develop the condition prior to joining the NFL.  Furthermore, the DVD makes the analogy used in the smoking/tobacco lawsuits of the 1990's, which again strengthens the NFL's initial position.... how or why is it that some people live to 100 who smoked their entire lives and others develop lung cancer after only a year or two???  Likewise, how is it that some football players in highschool have CTE and others 20 year NFL vets that were in thousands of collisions over their lifetime don't have the condition???  It was an interesting documentary worth watching.",1389830400,,1096,4.839572192513369

8610726,5,B00EZ8D46A,"Look , it's really that football causes brain damage not in all but some players. Some players that didn't get it are just lucky they didn't get those type of hits to there head. I'm not taking up for NFL....... But football period causes brain damage these guys have been playing for years before they got in the NFL so the NFL shouldn't be held responsible for the whole ordeal. A lot of players have concussions before they even get in the NFL. With that said the NFL should be held accountable to some point for sending players back on the field or letting them back on field to early. To hold them accountable there has to be more research into how much is the NFL 's fault.",1460764800,,679,4.3125
