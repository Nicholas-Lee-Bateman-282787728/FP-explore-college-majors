5904750,5,B00EDM2RR0,Blaise is on fire with her good clean comedy.  I loved her stand up as well as each of the characters she plays.  Good clean comedy for all ages.,1377820800,,145,3.9655172413793105

8604258,1,B00EDM2RR0,"A friend brought this to me in hopes we would have a fun night, I reassure you this did not occur. Blaise, in her feeble attempts to preform ""comedy"", exploits black christain stereotypes and is just really bad at it. As if that wasn't enough the quality of this film is horrendous and looks like it was shot with a 1990's camecorder by a child. The skits are on par with everything else in this film meaning they are absolutely s***. Overall 2/10 way to much water.",1446336000,,466,4.367816091954023
8604259,1,B00EDM2RR0,"The quality of recording makes it almost impossible to understand.  I found it to be a waste of money.  I was attracted to it because it was advertised as being ""clean.""  Just couldn't hear due to exceedingly poor recording.",1428796800,,224,4.6923076923076925
8604260,5,B00EDM2RR0,"Good, clean and funny!  I would definitely recommend it anyone who's ready to laugh.  The characters are authentic and relatable.",1395100800,,129,5.4
8604261,5,B00EDM2RR0,"I chose five stars because ten stars was not available!  I love, Love, LOVE Clean Comedy on Sunset Strip!  It is so very rare, in this age of foul and degrading ""humor"" to find comedy that not only makes you pass out laughing, but that you can enjoy with your children, parents and grandparents alike.  I enjoyed every single moment and Blaise Brooks is most definitely one to watch ... over and over again!  I am thankful someone heard the cry of people like me who want entertainment that doesn't offend, but is still amazing and enjoyable.  Thank you, Ms. Brooks!  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1389916800,,594,4.663461538461538
8604262,5,B00EDM2RR0,"Clean humor?  I thought it would be lacking some punch in the delivery, but I was delightfully mistaken. You're going to fall in love. This gal is a hoot times a hundred. Classy and funny to the max... can't wait for more!!!",1383264000,,224,4.333333333333333
8604263,5,B00EDM2RR0,"She is comical in a pure and virtuous way. Im soooooo happy this women created some material that the Family can watch.

8604265,5,B00EDM2RR0,"This is a 2 minute trailer for the film. You will laugh, and you will be shocked, and you will want to have this family film in your home.  This film has standup comedy, 4 incredibly funny skits.  The 4 characters all have lines that you will remember and want to repeat.  The standup comedy of Blaise Brooks is a style all her own. No one in the audience is safe, including her own Mother, her pastors, and especially her friends. This film has the Dove Foundation seal of approval which deems this film a Family film that is suitable for All ages. Clean Comedy on Dirty Sunset is an original never before done comedy concert film. Never before has there been standup and skits in a film.  Blaise Brooks has created a new genre of film. This film is for the people that work hard and long, but don't necessarily have the time to play.  I wanted to make sure that they had a film that could give them what I call a laughter break. I also wanted to create a project that had standup comedy that the entire family could watch. This film has a diverse cast of actors, who are some of the most talented individuals in the entertainment industry.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blaise-Brooks-Clean-Comedy-on-Dirty-Sunset/dp/B00EDM2RR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blaise Brooks Clean Comedy on Dirty Sunset</a>
