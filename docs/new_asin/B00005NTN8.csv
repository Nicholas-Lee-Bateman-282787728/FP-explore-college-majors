7947910,3,B00005NTN8,"My husband speaks Chinese for a living and so he likes everything Chinese.  He watches Chinese movies to keep up on the language and so therefore the whole family joins him.  I did find that this movie was rather confusing and had it not been for my husband explaining it to me, I probably would not have finished it.  However,  I was pleased by the fact that there was no indication of suicide in the movie.  I thought that it was put together very well and that I got to know a little bit more about chinese culture being as that it was made in china and therefore is more accurate towards Chinese culture.  I was pleased with the ending.  Considering that most Chinese movies end sad, I thought that the ending was actually a happy one.  I would recommend watching it with someone who understands the movie if you are not the type of person who understands abstract plots.",1124755200,,875,4.425
