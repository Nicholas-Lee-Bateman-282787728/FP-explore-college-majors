As others have mentioned, the cues aren't timed with the movements perfectly, but I just close my eyes and listen and follow through with the movements.  Don't be fooled, this is a challenging routine and will leave you feeling pleasantly sore!",1442793600,,334,5.054545454545455
7925841,5,B00004WMA1,"Beautiful setting. I love the sequence. It's not the most intense Travis Eliot sequence if you have done Ultimate Yogi, but it's perfectly unique in the DVDs available from him. Generally, I am fan of his meditative, mindful, holistic emphasis which is often missing ""Western"" yoga. It's so refreshing. The backgrounds are gorgeous.

Please note that the dubbing is not perfect. It seems to run behind what is going on in the screen. His descriptions are so good, you could a) focus on what he says and now what he is doing throughout which is very doable or b) keep an eye on the screen and getting used to the rhythm of doing what you think should be coming up next when you are repeating a flow instead of waiting for his cue. Either way, as long as you don't let yourself get frustrated and smile when things don't work out perfectly, you will find it to be great!",1432252800,3,868,4.459119496855346
7925842,4,B00004WMA1,"I love Travis Elliott and I have enjoyed doing this DVD immensely. If I have any complaint it is that the cues he gives you are behind the movements. It was frustrating at first because I couldn't look on the screen to make sure I was doing the pose correctly because hew was already transitioning into a new pose. However, now I can just listen and not watch and it makes it easier.",1427760000,3,383,4.260273972602739

7925844,5,B00004WMA1,"I really like this one! I also have Travis Eliot's Ultimate Yogi set, which is amazing. But, I wanted to try something different of his. He is a wonderful instructor, calm and clear in his directions. He employs what he calls ""holistic flow,"" making his classes meditative and strong. This is no exception. I feel great when I'm done with this one. Balanced and whole. I highly recommend it! To give more detail about content, there are three sections, each filmed in a different location. They flow well together, with no clear separation between them. That's a huge plus for me. The first focuses on sun salutations, the second on crescent lunges, warrior poses and other standing poses. Lastly, the third section is floor poses. I'd say this routine is good for intermediate to advanced, just because of intensity.",1412208000,7,817,4.884892086330935
7925845,4,B00004WMA1,"This was my first experience with Travis Eliot yoga - and I'm so glad that I happened upon this video because it led me to research Travis and learn more about his yoga teachings. This is a strenuous yoga practice - even for someone like me who's done yoga for years. The settings/locations are very different from many yoga videos and his calm, even voice is soothing and light. I'm a fan of Travis Eliot and have gone on to continue practicing under his tutelage via his Ultimate Yogi Series. If you're looking for an innovative, powerful, spiritual, and in depth new practice that will challenge you on all levels - this is for you.",1363478400,3,635,4.530434782608696
7925846,4,B00004WMA1,"I really enjoyed this yoga set. It's got a different vibe than most of the other ""stars"" of yoga. Not too instructional. Not too talkie. But an nice constant flow series in some interesting locations. Now for the bad news. There are two movie promos at the beginning of the DVD that have nothing to do with Yoga. And you must play them every time you want to do the DVD. The first time they were interesting. The next time pretentious. (One is about how Americans are perceived elsewhere in the world, the other is about poor boys living off pickings from cremated bodies thrown in a sacred river( ooooouuuu). I get it, everone hates Americans and the boys are poor.) Now they are just plain annoying. I usually set up the DVD and drink coffee and read the paper while this crap is running. It keeps me from doing the DVD as much as I probably would if it were just a yoga set and not a promotional tool for a couple of pretentious films no one will ever watch.",1334707200,9,961,4.314917127071824
