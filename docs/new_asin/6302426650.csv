7825358,5,6302426650,"All I can say is, this movie is so bad that it's great.  I don't why Mystery Science Theater 3000 didn't find this gem?",1405814400,,119,3.9583333333333335
7825359,4,6302426650,Nothing new about the story line.  More Vietnam vets trying to save the day.  The acting isn't bad and John Phillip Law is easy on the eyes! Give it a go!,1171497600,,154,3.935483870967742
7825360,5,6302426650,"Absolutely halarious low budget movie, must see. The main bad guy, Samsak, wears a Mr. Roarke disco suit and has Kim Jong ill hair. When plan ""A"" fails he radios to cronies to go to plan ""B"". Later when told plan ""B"" will definately fail, straight faced he orders plan ""C"" must not fail. The effects are hokey and editing and acting delightfully bad. A very fun movie!",1161907200,2,368,4.426470588235294
