8315983,5,B001KQS3VQ,My kids really enjoy this videos. This little guy is funny and the cartoon it's ok for different range of ages maybe from 1 to 4 years old. My 5yrs old kid it's not too much interested in Noddy as he was some years ago. The delivery was fast.,1373932800,,242,3.9591836734693877
8315984,5,B001KQS3VQ,"Loved watching all the Noddy cartoons with my daughter.  She's now three and they don't interest her as much (may have worn her out of them when they were on Sprout).  This is a British cartoon dubbed over with American voices.  Good moral to each show, and are nice to watch with little children.",1299196800,,297,4.462962962962963
8315985,5,B001KQS3VQ,"We were introduced to Noddy and Friends on the Sprout channel, which no longer airs the British show. Our then 2-yr old daughter fell in love the first time she saw it. Even our 8-month old triples (2 boys and a girl) take notice of the show when it was on the TV. We bought the set of 5 DVDs from Wal-mart, which did not include the book. The stories are ~ 10 mins long each and all are educationally based on social situations like sharing, good vs naughty behavior, cooperation, telling the truth, and even counting. The DVD sets also have a 3-4 minute segment in between each story called Say It With Noddy, during which the children are introduced to foreign languages and sounds not normally spoken in the English language. This helps with learning other languages later in life. The animation and colors are outstanding. The characters are engaging and easy for the young to identify with. We highly recommend this fun set - even the adults enjoy watching with the kids.",1278720000,2,977,4.588571428571429
8315986,5,B001KQS3VQ,"My daughter loves Noddy. We started watching it on PBS Sprout - in the ""On Demand"" Free Zone section offered by our cable TV provider. Recently Noddy was removed from the PBS Sprout offerings, which really annoys me, (In fact PBS Sprout content is now no longer available to me at all in the Free Zone b/c I don't pay to subscribe to the regular Sprout channel, but that's whole 'nother rant) so I have purchased a few of the Noddy DVD's, enabling me to still let my 3 yr old have her occasional fix. Is the content educational? Maybe a bit, but not particularly. For the most it's just warm, happy, colorful & charming, like watching your toys come to life and interact, which is the premise of the show, basically. The story lines are simple & engaging, and the episodes include singing & dancing. It's a British import, so it lacks the rank commericalism one usually encounters in children's programming. i.e. There are no commericals for Noddy dolls.",1254096000,,954,4.617647058823529
