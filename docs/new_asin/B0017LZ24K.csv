8266513,5,B0017LZ24K,"The fact that this DVD is $20 and is filled with great PWG matches from it's debut to 2007, this is pretty much a steal. While this is $20 don't just stand there and look at it..buy it already!!",1390867200,,194,4.0

8266515,5,B0017LZ24K,This is perhaps one of the best buys a fan of wrestling can get. Tons of great guys on the dvds. Excellent matchs. The crowds are better than many early pwg crowds. So there's heat all over the place. Exteremly good dvd set. But ignore the jokers trying to sell it for 999.99 right now. Go over to Highspots or PWG's own website and buy them for 20 and shipping. Just hit the audio button on your dvd player control and you will hear the comentary.,1337472000,,448,4.22093023255814
8266516,4,B0017LZ24K,"This DVD is amazing, if you are looking for the spectacle that is wrestling in the mainstream this isn't it.  200 plus attendance at best but the match quality is incredible.  The brisco's tag match in ungodly.  I would buy this stickily for this match alone.  Its a 3 disk set with some great wrestling.  I would recommend to a wrestler over a casual fan.  Wrestlers would appreciate it more and find more interest in the work rate.",1283558400,,433,4.487179487179487
8266517,5,B0017LZ24K,"PWG has succeeded over the last 5 years in highlighting a combination of local (Southern California), national, and overseas independent wrestling talent, many of whom have gone on to the ""big leagues."" This DVD itself has a great mix of traditional wrestling, hardcore wrestling, and comedy wrestling, all of which can be seen at any one of PWG's regular shows. At 3 discs and 9 hours, this DVD is an amazing value and you will not be disappointed in the least.

This DVD is a much welcomed alternative to the professional wrestling currently seen on TV (WWE and TNA). I love independent wrestling because of the ability of wrestlers to really connect with fans on a personal level. You really feel like the wrestlers are making a conscious effort to give you your money's worth. In any given match in this DVD set you can see how fans and wrestlers really feed off of one another to make the show great. You are not some ordinary fan lost in an arena of thousands, nor are they untouchable celebs safeguarded by security and limousines. The true atmosphere of independent wrestling really comes through your screen when you watch ""PWG Sells Out.""",1235433600,,1148,4.74
8266518,5,B0017LZ24K,"Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (or PWG) is an independent wrestling organization based out in Southern California that has been around since 2003.  While not as famous as some of the east coast indie organizations, it certainly has developed quite a following in L.A.  This box set highlights some of the matches that PWG put on during their first four years.  The matches on here (discussed in greater detail in other reviews) run the gauntlet from technical classics, to spot fests, to no-rules brawls.  So there is a little something for everybody, and enough variety to keep things fresh.  The production values for the DVD are actually fairly decent.  Before each match there is a little cut scene showing who is fighting, and (a great feature) you can turn the sometimes funny/sometimes lame commentary on and off.  When the commentary is turned off, you feel like you are right in the action - hear the crowd/ref/wrestlers, really a cool feature.

Not to say this set doesn't have its drawbacks.  Most of the wrestlers will be familiar to ROH/indie fans (or for those who watched WSX), but only a handful of the wrestlers have made the big leagues as of yet.  So if you only watch WWE and are looking to see some of your favorite superstars on here you will be disappointed (CMPunk does show up for one match, but that's it).  The packaging is also an issue - they just stack the three discs on top of each other and nothing is included telling you what matches are on the set (let alone what disc).  Finally, if you aren't used to indie wrestling the lack of ring entrances, pyros, or half naked women milling about the ring can be sort of jarring.

Overall, if you are a fan of independent wrestling or looking to expand your wrestling viewing beyond WWE/TNA - this is a great set to buy.  The price is great for the 9+ hours of amazing wrestling you get.  If you like what you see, you can order most of the PWG shows from the company's website.",1227571200,3,1948,4.557471264367816
8266519,5,B0017LZ24K,"I have been a wrestling fan since 1996 and have watched all kinds of wrestling. I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 50 all together.

PWG Sells Out- The Best of Pro Wrestling Guerilla Vol. 1
Pro Wrestling Guerrilla is based out of Southern California, and after watching this DVD set I am convinced they have some of best wrestling in the world. This is a glorious three-disk set showing introducing us to PWG and some of its greatest matches. These matches do a great job of showing us some new talent, and showing us the progression of PWG history. I want you to pick this one up as soon as possible.

-Disc 1-

Excalibur begins this set off by telling us that there are going to be some awesome matches in this set. Pointless, but it introduces you to one of the commentators.

""American Dragon"" Bryan Danielson VS Samoa Joe (The Musical, 4/17/04)
This was a very strong match that contained many different styles of wrestling. There was submission wrestling, comedy wrestling, and brawling all mixed into one. The comedy part had these two great wrestlers...trying to out dance each other. I didn't enjoy that part, but some might. Both men use a ridiculous amount of submissions. I didn't really like the time-limit draw ending or the aftermath.
RATING- 8.5/10

CM Punk VS Super Dragon (The Reason For The Season, 7/10/04)
This was another very strong match. This match however wasn't a back and forth type of match as Punk dominated Dragon mostly. Punk even goes as far as to steal Dragon's Curb Stomp a couple of times. Dragon regains momentum towards the end of the match and things pick up. Considering the previous match's ending, the ending for this one is great.
RATING- 8/10

Steel Cage Match, Loser Leaves PWG Forever (The Reason For The Season, 7/10/04)
PWG Championship
Adam Pearce(c) VS Frankie Kazarian
This was a huge feud that would finally be settled in a Steel Cage. The match begins with some brawling that eventually leads outside. A glass bottle busts Pearce open very early. Sadly, the picture is too dark for you to see much of the outside brawling. Once they enter the cage, things slow done considerably. Colt Cabana provides some unneeded interference. The cage is horrible and doesn't stay in play when people hit it, so the impact seems lessened. I love the ending with Kazarian stealing Pearce's finishing move multiple times to finish him off.
RATING- 7.5/10

Christopher Daniels VS Jack Evans (Free Admission (Just Kidding!), 11/13/04)
If you have never been exposed Jack Evans before, he is probably the greatest high flyer in the industry today. This was Evans first match in PWG and it was pretty good. The match started off with some comedic moments, then shifted into some good wrestling. Evans shows off his acrobatic skills many times in this match.
RATING- 7/10

PWG Championship (All Nude Revue, 2/12/05)
Super Dragon(c) VS Samoa Joe
This was a solid match up. You got some dives to the outside and a side Psycho Driver hit on Joe. The match is short though. The aftermath saw Dragon being attacked by Super Dragon 2.
RATING- 7.5/10

Number 1 Contender for PWG Championship (All Star Weekend Night 1, 4/1/05)
AJ Styles VS Samoa Joe
These guys have had so many matches I've lost count. This one stands up to the rest of them very well. Styles shows his strength in the beginning by hitting a few power moves. Joe controls most of the rest of the match. Near the end they start going back and forth. Good ending.
RATING- 9/10

NWA World Heavyweight Championship/ PWG Championship (Guitarmageddon, 6/11/05)
AJ Styles(c) VS James Gibson
AJ Styles is so awesome has two top championships. Gibson controls a lot of the match with submission moves, but Styles gets his strong points. The ending is a fairly fake looking, but loved it.
RATING- 8/10

-Disc 2-

Excalibur starts disk two off by explaining how we've been suckered in and are now going to see some more original Southern California talent.

Titles VS Masks Match (2nd Anniversary Weekend Night 1, 7/9/05)
PWG Tag Team Championships
Chris Bosh & Scott Lost(c) VS Quicksilver & Scorpio Sky
Quicksilver and Scorpio Sky are the masked men in this match. This match has some awesome double team moves and a great work rate. The ending is extremely emotional and surprising.
RATING- 8/10

El Generico/Jack Evans/Frankie Kazarian/Super Dragon VS Scott Lost/Ricky Reyes/ Davey Richards/Joey Ryan (2005 Battle of Los Angeles Night 2, 9/4/05)
This was a fun eight-man tag match. Each man has his own rival on the opposing side. Everyone gets good offence. A Psycho Driver/Moonsault Combination ends this match on a high note.
RATING- 7/10

Guerrilla Warfare Match (Astonishing X-Mas, 12/18/05) (Match of the DVD)
Super Dragon VS ""Mr. Wrestling"" Kevin Steen
PWG has never been about Hardcore/Deathmatch wrestling, but that changes on this night. Steen was revealed to be Super Dragon 2. There is a lot of hatred in this match due to Steen costing Dragon matches lately. We see a brawl through the crowd with a ton of chairs flying all over the place. Once they get in the ring they use all kinds of weapons. The pacing and the story telling are great.
RATING- 10/10

PWG Tag Team Titles (Hollywood Globetrotters, 3/4/06)
Super Dragon & Davey Richards(c) VS Jack Evans & Roderick Strong
If you don't like watching the matches with commentary, at least turn it on for this one. This match has some of the funniest commentary I've ever heard. Dragon also provides a lot of comedic moments in this match. Evans provides some entertaining acrobatics. Richards and Strong provide a solid wrestling base. This is an awesome match with yet another awesome finish.
RATING- 9.5/10

Steel Cage Match (Threemendous, 7/16/06)
PWG Championship
Joey Ryan(c) VS B-Boy
This was a great cage match. This time the cage is fairly stable, which helps the match a lot. The men are supposed to stay locked in the cage ala Hell in the Cell, but after a downed referee is taken out, they escape. Plenty of brawling and big spots. Most spots you can see coming, but they are fun to watch anyway.
RATING- 8.5/10

Semi-Finals in Battle of Los Angeles (2006 Battle of Los Angeles Night 3, 9/3/06)
CIMA VS El Generico
This was one of the coolest matches I've ever seen. It was like a slow-paced highflying match. Never heard of that one before have you. There are a ton of innovative moves and the crowd is going crazy.
RATING- 9.5/10

El Generico VS ""The Man That Gravity Forgot"" PAC (All Star Weekend 4 Night 2, 11/18/06)
Wow. This match is amazing. PAC is one of the greatest high flyers in the world today and he proves it here. This isn't just a highflying match; it has a lot of great wrestling in it. This match ends with a sick brainbuster on turnbuckle. I was in shock for about ten minutes after this match.
RATING- 10/10

-Disc 3 -

Excalibur begins this DVD telling us how we loved the first six hours so much. He is now going to show off some of the international talent in PWG.

Guerrilla Warfare Match (Based on a True Story, 1/13/07)
PWG Championship
Joey Ryan(c) VS Human Tornado
Finally someone steps up and dethrones the yearlong champion in Joey Ryan. This isn't as good as the previous Guerrilla Warfare match, but it is awesome. There are a lot of weapons used and plenty of sick spots. There is one spot where a woman has thumbtacks thrown in her top and is dropkicked. It's very sick.
RATING- 9/10

PAC VS Kevin Steen (Holy Diver Down, 2/24/07)
Nice Big Man VS Little Man type contest. Steen doesn't take PAC seriously until he starts getting his with the crazy, highflying moves. There are some really big spots in this match, including a powerbomb off the top rope. Not as good as PAC's last match on this set, but still a fun encounter.
RATING- 8/10

Kaz Hayashi VS PAC (All Star Weekend 5 Night 2, 4/8/07)
This was a solid encounter. Kaz focuses on the arm of PAC throughout most of the match. PAC doesn't do as much highflying in this match, but occasionally has a great move.
RATING- 8/10

CIMA VS Bryan Danielson (DDT4 Night 1, 5/19/07)
Both these men are very evenly matched. The match starts off with them feeling each other out with some slow offence. The match carries into Danielson pulling of a train of unique submission moves. The match really picks up in the final ten minutes. Funny aftermath.
RATING- 9.5/10

Finals in Tag Team Title Tournament (DDT4 Night 2, 5/20/07)
PWG Tag Team Championships
Jay & Mark Briscoe VS PAC & Roderick Strong
The Tag Titles are vacated and this was the finals in a tournament to decide a new champion. Jay and Mark use Tag Team wrestling 101 tactics to control PAC most of the match. It is a nice change in pace from the other Tag Team matches on this DVD. PAC pulls off some new highflying moves, including a shooting star press/shooting star knee drop combination.
RATING- 8.5/10

PWG Tag Team Championships (Giant Size Annual #4, 7/29/07)
PAC & Roderick Strong(c) VS El Generico & Kevin Steen
This match was originally supposed to be the Briscoe Brothers against the Tag Team Champions, but they didn't show up. I surprising team of bitter rivals forms in El Generico and Kevin Steen for this match. Steen continues to make Generico cheat while they isolate PAC. You get a nice ending, which features double finishers.
RATING- 8/10

PWG Championship (Giant Size Annual #4, 7/29/07)
El Generico(c) VS Bryan Danielson
Directly following the previous match, Bryan Danielson comes out and challenges El Generico for the PWG Championship. Danielson has also already had a match earlier in the evening against the barbaric Necro Butcher. Both men still go out and put on an awesome, yet a little short, match. The match ends after three Cattle Mutilations are applied. This is a great ending to an amazing DVD.

8266520,5,B0017LZ24K,9 hours of some of the greatest indie wrestling I have ever seen! Kevin Steen and super dragons match was SICK! All of the matches were just amazing! Any fan of wrestling would be a fool not to own this dvd!,1217030400,,207,4.073170731707317
8266521,5,B0017LZ24K,"Pro Wrestling Guerilla is, in my opinion, the most underrated indy fed in the United States today.  They have put on a product that has easily rivaled the quality of ROH or other top indies for years, and have never gotten the respect or recognition that they deserve.

Giant Size Annual #4 - July 29, 2007
Pro Wrestling Guerrlla World Championship Title Match
21. El Generico vs. Bryan Danielson - what makes this match even more amazing is both men already wrestled hard hitting matches earlier in the evening, and they still came out and put on a MOTYC.

I honestly think this is one of the greatest DVD values of all time.  That many 4+ star matches for just a low price just blows my mind.  If are even a remote fan on independent wrestling or any of the wrestlers listed, this is a MUST BUY.  You will have no regrets whatsoever.

Just a stellar match listing.  The only omission I can possibly think of is the Super Dragon vs. Joey Ryan Iron Man match, but since that was an hour long I can understand why it had to be dropped.  Gotta save SOMETHING for the next PWG DVD set!",1212624000,16,4882,4.398663697104677
