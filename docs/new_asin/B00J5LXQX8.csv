6337172,4,B00J5LXQX8,"Like"" Just Me ""bvd"""" I'm an Alan Rickman fan, and ""Truly Madly Deeply"" is one of my top ten favorites, but I was interested in this both because I'm a Colin Firth fan and loved the original film with Michael Caine, Shirley MacClaine & Herbert Lom. They are both light films but I like this version better, which I bought in region 2 format from Amazon UK. Will probably buy the US version as well. Funny and quite different from the original -- Caneron Diaz is a rodeo cowgirl from Texas and Alan Rickman a ruthless businessman who likes to work nude and has a cat shaved to look like a lion with a mane and tuft at the end of its tail. Colin Firth is hilarious and still gorgeous after all these years, and it was a treat to see Tom Courtney (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Loneliness-of-the-Long-Distance-Runner/dp/B000MQKPFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</a>&nbsp;) as his co-conspirator.",1379462400,20,980,5.288461538461538

6337186,5,B00J5LXQX8,Colin just kills in this movie and Cameron is just adorable. This movie is just too perfect.  I cannot decide which of the many scenes are funnier:  Colin trying to explain that he wants to see a rodeo to find PJ  or him getting caught in the cat / lion alarm system(where cameron has to save him of course) is the best part!  I love them all.,1467763200,,343,4.074626865671642

6337193,5,B00J5LXQX8,"My god, this is the funniest movie I've seen in years! Subtle tongue in cheek humor and Alan Rickman is a magnificent movie-stealer as always. Not a fan of Cameron Diaz but Colin Firth is also wonderfully humourous.",1461369600,,215,4.684210526315789
6337204,2,B00J5LXQX8,"Sturgeon's Law (paraphrased) states ""90% of fiction, music, art and films is of low quality"". The Cohen Brothers have a pretty good track record with more than 50% of their offerings residing in the elite 10% of ""good material"". However, when good filmmakers miss the strike zone, they tend to hit the batter. In this case, the batter is the audience, and the Cohen brothers, despite good intentions, pitched one right at the head missing the strike zone by a mile. ""Gambit"", a throwback to the caper comedies popular in the 1960's with the likes of Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, is a good idea with a good cast wasted on a poorly written script. The ""funny parts"" weren't funny, and I couldn't take the serious parts seriously. The most entertaining parts are the cartoon intro, a common device of 1960's films of this ilk, and a couple of flash-back and flash-forward scenes. From there it goes downhill.

The central premise, decent but its script needed a lot more rewrites, involves the hustling of a billionaire magnate out of millions by selling him a fake painting. Harry Deane (Colin Firth) is a disgruntled art-curator seeking to outwit his vain employer, billionaire Lord Lionel Shabandar (Alan Rickman), out of millions of pounds. Lord Lionel has a weakness for Monet paintings, particularly the ones featuring haystacks. Deane solicits the help of The Major (Tom Courtenay) who can replicate paintings by the best modern masters. Before the events of the story, we learn the Major has faked a Monet. Now they need a hook to entice their prey.

They find a pretty young woman, PJ Puznowski (Cameron Diaz), a cowgirl rodeo enthusiast in Texas, and create a narrative in which her family has supposedly owned a real Monet for many years. Deane and the Major find her at a bar in Texas, and she agrees to engage in the deception for a fee of 500,000, or about $800,000 US. For the con to work, they take a picture of PJ and her mother sitting on an old 1970's couch in a caravan/mobile home which is then published in a rodeo magazine, which happens to be one of Lord Lionel's many publications. There's a short sequence in which Deane and the Major imagine how the con will play out successfully before they return the current ""time"" in which they need to convince PJ.

She agrees, and then Deane shows the magazine photo to Lord Lionel who believes the painting only to be a replica because of its residing in a mobile home (called a ""caravan"" in British English) in Texas. Deane convinces him they should at least explore the possibility the painting is real, and they fly PJ to London. PJ meets Lionel, but rather to Deane's horror, PJ takes a liking to Lord Lionel and begins having doubts about engaging in the deception. Back at his flat, Deane keeps getting punched out by his neighbor. Is this supposed to be funny? Also, we learn Deane is nearly tapped out, being forced to pay extravagant prices for PJ's accommodations at the Savoy Hotel in London, one of the most expensive in Europe.

Lord Lionel then asks PJ on a dinner date at a Japanese Restaurant where they meet the Kon'nichiwa Media Club who are there to interpret Japanese for the English-speaking guests. Up until now, some of the humor was barely tolerable and I wanted the story to get on track about the con. However, the Cohen Brothers opted for nearly-offensive stereotyping of Japanese people I guess for cheap laughs. Then Deane finds a priceless vase in the hallway of the hotel and tries to pilfer it by risking his life on the hotel ledge. Couldn't he have just stuffed it into a suitcase? I found the rest of the film going from hard-to-watch to nearly-insufferable.

You have to credit the three leads for doing the best they could with a mediocre script. Rickman makes an excellent multi-zillionaire as PJ calls him, Firth a good straight-man to Diaz and Rickman, and Diaz as the clueless southern American who knows nothing about British/European culture. Unfortunately, there were too many over-the-top moments which I guess were designed to be funny but more in the ""you can't be serious"" department. Deane literally losing his pants to steal the vase was one of many. Also, I wasn't quite buying that Deane was ""tapped out"". I was expecting something at the beginning, maybe a sequence with him and Rickman in which he's denied a raise or similar denial for loyal service. Also, I started to find Firth's character annoying as the film progressed rather than rooting for him to take his employer to the cleaners. Unfortunately, the Cohen brothers missed the strike zone on this one and ended up in Sturgeon's 90%. What a bummer.",1459641600,,4628,4.73697270471464
6337205,4,B00J5LXQX8,Loved Alan Rickman.  Diaz was bad.  Firth turned out just a common their.  At first I thought it really about how he was treated by Rickman.  Did not like that outcome.,1459036800,,168,4.32258064516129

6337208,3,B00J5LXQX8,This is the only time I have EVER given a Colin Firth movie a 3. But the overall feel of this movie (to me) is cartoon-wish. Carrmin Diaz is god awful at trying to be a southern gal and Colin Firth seems disheveled and fragmented.,1455580800,,230,4.133333333333334

6337213,3,B00J5LXQX8,"British guy seems to live a life where nothing really goes his way. He is constantly knocked around both verbally and physically. He soldiers on without losing his temper. So he comes up with a plan to cheat his mean ""boss"" out of millions of dollars over a painting. It involves going to TX and getting a girl from a small town to participate in his con game. Nothing goes his way from the get-go.

There are some funny pieces. Very stiff British humor. Some just stupid (to me as an American) parts. There are of course the stereotypes of Texans and small town Americans, as well as Brits that really is getting old and outdated. But there is a funny scene where he is in TX, in a bar, ready to proposition the Cameron character with his scheme. It is basically the entire movie/plot played out in the Firth's character's head. Then he snaps to reality and you get to see how it ""really"" plays out. Sorta funny.",1448755200,,913,4.402366863905326

6337246,4,B00J5LXQX8,"I spend a nice, relaxing moment watching this very honest comedy, even if it is not any kind of masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

British art curator Harry Deane (Colin Firth) works for a morbidly rich and horribly abusive man, media mogul Lord Lionel Shabandar (Alan Rickman). After years of suffering he decides to take revenge on his boss, by using his one Achilles heel - Monet. Indeed Shabandar is obsessed with Monet's paintings and especially he was hunting for years and years for a little known piece known as ""Haystacks at Dusk"", which was plundered by Goering in 1940, but vanished since 1945. To succeed Deane teams up with a master art forger known as the Major (Tom Courtenay) and a rodeo girl from Texas, a certain PJ Puznowski (Cameron Diaz), the granddaughter of American sergeant who supposedly was the last man to see the painting in 1945... The plan is to sell a supposedly miraculously found painting to Shabandar for a ridiculous amount of money... Of course, no plan survives intact the first moments of battle and therefore from the beginning virtually everything will go wrong...))) That covers the first two minutes of the film and then the story really begins.

This is the remake of a 1966 comedy under the same title with Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine. I admit with some shame that I didn't see this film and therefore I cannot compare them - but this 2012 remake was quite entertaining and well done.

All the four main actors did really very well and once Stanley Tucci appears, in a couple of short but significant cameos, he is absolutely irresistible too...))) The scenario for this 2012 version was written by Coen brothers and you can instantly feel it, as characters are well worked out, dialogs are quite good and jokes are funny. There is only one scene in which the humour flies a little bit lower (it involves an embarassing wet spot on the pants of one of the characters) but it is not a very long one. There is no obscenities and nothing gross - in fact the film is so dignified, that one lonely f@rt joke sounds with nobility of a national anthem...))) There are also some rather surprising twists and the ending is not bad at all.

Summa summarum I liked this film, I laughed a lot and I spend a nice relaxing moment watching it. I may even keep the DVD for another viewing in the future. ENJOY!",1432080000,,2384,4.64218009478673
6337247,4,B00J5LXQX8,This is actually a pretty good movie.  My wife made me watch it with her.  My expectation was very low but the movie is actually funny and interesting to watch.  There is nothing like spending quality time with your spouse to share a few laughters together in a evening after dinner.  This is probably one of the best Cameron Diaz movies I have seen.,1430611200,,350,4.421875

6337292,3,B00J5LXQX8,"An uneven but entertaining art heist film based on the classic 60's adventure starring Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine.  This one, with Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, and Cameron Diaz has moments of inspiration and downright lunacy- most courtesy of the amiable Firth and the comically menacing Rickman.  Ms. Diaz gives a buffoonish turn to the Texan ""socialite"", which comes close to sinking the ship in a sea of cartoonish overacting and bad accents.

However, the dialogue and pacing is top notch with Stanley Tucci nearly stealing the picture as a bombastic German art curator.  One wishes he had a more significant presence in the film.

Overall a funny, delightful, light caper comedy with solid performances by Rickman, Firth and Tucci.",1408147200,2,742,5.15

Gambit actually surprised me a bit as I didn't really expect much from the movie when I rented it but I do like Diaz and decided to give it a watch.  The movie has some funny moments in it (especially the hotel scenes) and was actually funnier than I expected.  Although the humor is a bit uneven in its execution.

Additional humor in a slapstick sort of way e.g. getting locked in a closet then escaping by walking on a ledge; appearing in an swank hotel without your pants.

6337377,3,B00J5LXQX8,"Gambit is a remake of the 1966 Michael Caine/Shirley MacLaine caper film. The new version, directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, updates the story to contemporary Texas and England. Harry Deane (Colin Firth) and PJ Puznowski (Cameron Diaz) join forces to trick Harrys bully of a boss, rich British art collector Lionel Shahbandar (Alan Rickman), into buying a Monet fake by a skilled forger (Tom Courtenay).

Everything that can go wrong, does, in a series of farcical episodes involving Harrys comic humiliations. The major flaw is the lack of chemistry between Firth and Diaz. They often seem to have wandered in from other movies. Firth tries hard but never gets into the proper groove. He looks uncomfortable and seems a poor fit for the farcical situations. Ms. Diaz looks beautiful as always but lacks any iota of subtlety in her performance.

6337392,3,B00J5LXQX8,"Gambit is a mildly diverting time waster that I've been waiting to see for a while because of the names of its two writers prominently attached to its marketing. Sure Gambit isn't a Coen Brothers film per se, but the presence of Colin Firth and Alan Rickman doing their best to be funny almost hides the unfortunate anchor keeping it from being something you'll remember long after watching.
I've never seen the original Gambit so unlike The Italian Job or True Grit I don't have that bias holding me back from liking the film. As it goes Gambit is a mildly humorous film driven by stoic Colin Firths unfortunate ability to be a goof ball mucking up what He sees as the best made plans. Using the presence of an American Rodeo star He plans to con his boss into buying a forged painting thought lost to the ages from Nazi plundering. Thats the gist of the story told in an amazingly short time, something to hold in regard in this age where every film seems to need to push the two hour boundary.
Then again this isn't A Serious Man, or even Raising Arizona. It is also thankfully not The Ladykillers, finding the right tone and carrying it through several setups to the finale earning some chuckles along the way. The appeal of Rickman and Firth go a long way in to providing humor to the story. Firth plays the hapless Harry Deane well creating a character who's not willing to admit defeat even when his actions are creating more and more chaos in his reality. Theres a long sequence I particularly liked in the middle of the film that Firth just plays right where He's stuck in hotel, trying to escape a laundry room without pants. Its silly but the way Firth handles every obstacle was funny to me.
Rickman on the other hand plays that Alan Rickman character very, very well as an egotistical millionaire boss, One of the clever things about the role is the way its meant to subvert our view every so often, from the opening sequence which is changed in a twist, to his flirtations with Diaz. This is like the melding of Professor Snape and Hans Gruber played by an actor having fun.
Less fun is the one thing that felt wrong in Cameron Diaz. I'm not one of those people who hate Ms. Diaz as an actress but to me compared to Rickman and Firth her P.J. Puznowski is too broad a performance, ill fitting in the role. From the accent to the way she dresses Diaz was a performer trying to be funny without the grace to actually make me laugh which is a shame. But then again in an eighty minute movie its not a terrible flaw especially when Firth and Rickman are doing the heavy lifting with their characters.
In the end Gambit won't be remembered a year from now. Its not a great comedy but its a fun movie for that hour and a half that entertained me despite its problems.",1399766400,2,2775,4.400778210116732

We usually only do that with a few famous sitcoms out there. But we had stopped this movie numerous times to finish giggling or laughing! That just doesn't happen very often.

You cannot figure out the end by the start of the movie, the jokes are extremely witty and sly, understated and performed exactly right. Alan Rickman, Colin Firth and Cameron Diaz are awesome. You didn't want anyone else in each role. It's perfect. We don't enjoy a lot of movies these days.

as a diehard coen brothers fan, i have to mention this quirk: the screenplay is by the coen brothers but is ""mise en scne"" by michael hoffman. if you know the coen brothers movies, the effect is uncanny. at some points you can see the coen visual humor blossom on the screen -- for example, the texas mobile home, the blustery femininity of the texas cowgirl, the natty demeanor of the art forger. but other scenes, such as the prolonged shenanigans in the savoy hotel, seem cut from a late ernst lubitsch caper. this puts a peculiar burden on colin firth as the caper mastermind, who must get punched in the face like nicholas cage in ""raising arizona"" but look unflappably suave with no pants on running around the savoy hotel. the good news is that firth is quite good at striking the balance (""did you say, room *thirteen* eighteen?"") and the comedy amalgam of coen and lubitsch is great fun to watch.",1399075200,,2026,4.82183908045977

Filmed on location in and around London, it proves quite unexpectedly funny: Firth demonstrates a particular talent for comedy, simply by remaining straight-faced, while Diaz has great fun in an unexpected piece of casting.  The plot is gossamer-thin, involving the creation of a fake painting which Caine hopes to sell to Rickman; what matters more is that the plan keeps going wrong.  There are some memorable set-piece scenes here, notably Firth's parading up and down the halls of London's chic Savoy Hotel without his pants, or Diaz's untuneful karaoke rendition of ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" in front of a group of Japanese business people.

Cameron Diaz has a challenging role to play as a Texas rodeo star who lives in a trailer with her mother.

Alan Richman also gets to act outrageously as a billionaire art collector who is beyond rude to everyone around him.
