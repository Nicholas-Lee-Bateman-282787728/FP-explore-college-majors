If you have a laptop with a HDMI port, just download VLC player online (this player won't be regionaly restricted) hook the laptop up to the tv via HDMI port and use vlc player to play any dvd. If you have a cordless mouse even better, this will eliminate the trip back and forth to play and pause.

Ps: I don't own this box but loads of dvds with different regions (due to traveling and living abroad), the only movie I've seen on here is pans labyrinth and its a great and original fantasy story with a very light touch of thriller/scary, only down side is the subtitles.",1499644800,,707,4.438461538461539

Definitely, seems that I lost my money. Never again buy international movies through Amazon.",1397433600,6,284,4.588235294117647
