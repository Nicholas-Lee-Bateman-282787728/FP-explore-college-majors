1828192,5,B000087F0L,One of my favorite movies of the past year.  Looking forward to its release on DVD.  Amazing black comedy that is directed by Oscar Winner Anders Thomas Jensen (who also wrote Mifune and Open Hearts).  Stars the biggest names in Danish cinema in a film that won't soon be forgotten.  The Danish version of the Coen Brothers but maybe with a tad more violence and a tad more heart.,1047168000,27,380,4.463768115942029

1828345,4,B000087F0L,"This is a difficult movie to rate or categorize.  It's very good overall, but I'm not sure if it's satire, comedy, thriller, crime, or what?  It's all and a little more I think.  It's one of those films where you have to see it to understand why I'm so confused.  If you like to be confused and entertained, this is the film for you.

It's sub-titled and in an older 4x5 or 4x6 format so if that bothers you, be forewarned.",1433808000,,423,4.172839506172839
1828366,5,B000087F0L,"The movie is slow. And, in the end, it goes nowhere. But it is funny, intriguing, moving, and, overall, fairly happy. Good acting, good direction. Visuals are not important and are average. Still, a technical analysis does no justice to the movie. It's like watching someone ice-skating. The person may look perfectly ordinary or even below-average. The routine may be complex, dangerous, and beautiful. In the end, of course, it is just a performance and doesn't go anywhere. But it still worth watching and you will have missed something good if you don't watch it.",1433721600,,567,4.978947368421053
1828367,4,B000087F0L,"First of all, I don't consider myself a film critic in any way, shape or form.  I can only review this film based on my own likes and I liked this one a lot.
I am a fan of Scandinavian films,specifically Danish and this one did not disappoint. In addition, the cast included two of my favorite Danish actors, Mads Mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas. Story follows  4 thugs, friends since childhood now grown up who have skipped town after ripping off the wrong people.  If you can handle bad language ,violence,drug use mixed with Danish humor (we would call in USA ""black humor"") you will most likely enjoy this tale.",1433376000,2,614,4.513513513513513

1828369,5,B000087F0L,"Started to not watch because of the subtitles, but once you get past that, the movie is very interesting and unique. It starts out as bad guys owing money to other bad guys because of a cigarette heist gone bad. But it was not what I expected with the usual guys chasing those who owed them the money and allot of car chases and gun fighting The plot becomes very interesting and unique from then on because of what the guys with the money they kept do with it. The acting and directing are great. The man who plays the slightly deranged farmer has some hilarious momets and turns out to be the hero at the end of the film.  I found this movie entertaining and well worth watching again.",1432944000,,687,4.2846153846153845
1828370,4,B000087F0L,"A real surprise. Temporarily turned off by subtitles. But what a gem after getting into it. Want to find more movies by this director! Hilarious, enjoyed the whole thing. Kinda like Coen brothers' Fargo gone Danish.",1431216000,,215,5.0

1828374,4,B000087F0L,"A dark, sort-of-a-comedy about four, not overly bright, thugs.  All of whom grew up in families which, if not actually dysfunctional, were certainly far from functional.  Which is a pretty good description of our four, not very likeable, ""heroes"".  Despite their best efforts to get themselves killed & lose their stolen money,  the four manage to survive.  Perhaps to even prevail if they can stop making dumb decisions & learn to cook.  This movie does not have the prerequisite shootings, explosions, high speed chases & general mayhem which many audiences require in order to be entertained.  As best as I can recall, only 3 people, a couple of cows & some ducks actually die.  Do not despair if you like violence, some others do get shot.  Against my expectations after reading some of the reviews, I liked this movie.",1426809600,2,823,4.863309352517986

The plot centers around four men whose friendship has survived despite the fact that they are utterly inept criminals. I won't recap the story, but I will say that the scenes where we get each man's back story are heartbreaking and beautiful. There is a fair amount of violence, but it is so over-the-top that it tends to be funny as well as horrifying. Watch this, then Green Butchers, then Adam's Apples.

This film is very similar in style and presentation to those of the Coen Brothers.  If you enjoyed FARGO, BLOOD SIMPLE, BURN AFTER READING, or several of the other Coen Brothers works, you will enjoy this querky, sometimes funny, sometimes bittersweet story.",1397520000,,436,4.8

It's funny and charming, and I recommend this movie to those who enjoy a good foreign film.",1382140800,,381,4.428571428571429
1828432,4,B000087F0L,"I watched this film (Amazon Instant Video) as part of my plan to watch every film Mads Mikkelsen is in. I know him primarily from Hannibal, although now also for some other exceptional films such as ""After the Wedding"".  Mikkelsen's role in Flickering Lights is a supporting role, and his acting is limited in range because of this. He plays a heroic thug -- a man with great loyalty and courage whose childhood limited his options.

I do not want to give away the plot -- it would spoil the film. And I must caution that there is violence to both humans and animals.  But if you can get past these this it is a tale of redemption and even love.

I do some charity among the homeless people in my city. Generally this charity consists of pocket money, listening and sometimes  bikes or sleeping bags.  I do not try to get them to adopt a middle class lifestyle.  I accept them for who they are at whatever point in their life they find themselves.  This film is about that -- redemption on their own terms, not terms imposed upon them. Having said that, there is a (slight) similarity between Torkild and Tony Soprano -- they both long for middle class banal comforts:  a house, golf, a regular job, and Torkild is definitely the leader, just as Tony Soprano was the leader.

If you read about people with Asperger Syndrome (Temple Gradin is the most famous) ""learning"" to fit into the world of non-Asperger people, you will understand that cultural rules are not inherent.  The 4 friends -- Torkild, Arne, Stefan and Peter -- have a thug's version of the rules. Among other things, they have to learn that you cannot just shoot people in middle class Denmark.

I read about  a Christian organization who wanted to use films as outreach. They commissioned a screenwriter to write a screenplay that demonstrated redemption. The film was ""The Spitfire Grill"".

Flickering Lights is not like that, and probably would horrify Christians, but it is strangely also like that. This film is a story of rejection, love and redemption.  And it touched me deeply.",1376956800,,2052,4.645429362880886

1828437,5,B000087F0L,"Slightly daft, slightly dark and definitely very juvenile, this is a film about four kids (heavily disguised as inept gangsters in their thirties) who find their true selves in a rural shack in the forest.
Apart from being couch potatoes watching RICH MAN POOR MAN episodes there isn't much to do while they consider what next and how to escape with the money they've stolen from a big city crim. Barcelona is a possibiliy but in the meantime...
The four are nicely differentiated: their leader first succumbs to the rural idyll and decides to turn the dump into a restaurant, the cokehead learns to prefer beer, the guy with the gun fetish (all fizz and firecrackers) learns to hunt (and to cook but this may be only an approximation) and the fourth, well, he learns to enjoy himself as himself without being bossed around by his girlfriend Hanne.
The locals are even more bizarre than the transported gangsters.
The plot is reasonably predictable (the writer/director has since made more sophisticated films with many of these actors) but the flavour of the piece is what makes it original and funny.  He has a talent for dialogue which is character laden and also comic in its ridiculousness.
This goes nicely with a few beers and a meat pie.
If you like this you'll like THE GREEN BUTCHERS and ADAM'S APPLES.

But this movie is all about Sren Pilmark as the brooding, introspective gangster Torkild.

The gang members, childhood friends, each face a personal crisis of one sort or another and decide to run away with the money to start a new life rather than turn over the loot.

* Terrific cast.  Mads Mikkelsen (""Arne"") and Ulrich Thomsen (""Peter"") are particularly good.
* Witty lines in a dark / bleak comedy.
* Violent in a number of scenes (involving humans and animals)
* The film loops in reflections and flashbacks of the gang's childhood and upbringing but does so in a superficial and unconvincing manner.

The acting is, of course, superb. One should only expect as much from a film that has so many of Denmark's best actors in it. The pace is good and the movie makes you laugh. It's never boring, has a few twists you might not expect and overall it just works very well for what it is.

I can watch this movie over and over again, because it's just that kind of a good 'black comedy' film. If you've a fan of foreign movies, especially Danish films, I would definitely encourage you to check this one out. You'll be missing out if you don't.",1230940800,,729,4.237410071942446

Be forewarned before you purchase this - Vanguard Video has really botched this release.  It's 4:3 widescreen, low resolution, massive compression (the entire disc contains only 3.8gb of data).  Worse, there's a ""Special Features"" option on the main menu - but just try to click it.  Go ahead and try!  It won't work.  Why?  Because they apparently decided to leave off the special features but *neglected to remove the option from the menu*.  Certainly a trailer was all they were going to offer, and there was still more than enough room on the disk for that.

Oh, and the subtitles are burned directly onto the video.  What you have here is a DVD version of the VHS master.  And I thought Strand was the hands-down winner of DVD butchery.  I can master a better DVD than this, and I don't get paid to do it.",1188604800,6,846,4.529801324503311

As people they do not--not that that would matter if the film worked. The film suffers from a schizophrenic quality: it's as if visitors from Goodfellas have taken up residence at a ""kro"" in a forest in Jutland (think: Joe Pesci eats herring). I have no idea where this ""heart"" that others have mentioned appears in the film.  The main characters, depicted as permanently damaged goods, emphasized by some surreal childhood flashbacks, never seem to experience any major transformation or revelation.  No scene of absolution or contrition ever occurs. Even scenes leading in the direction of change are soon thwarted by more violent behavior (it's late in the film when the main character punches an innocent, albeit annoying, pregnant woman in the nose).
