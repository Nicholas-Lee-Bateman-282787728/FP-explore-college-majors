There are good characters and the interaction between some of them is very entertaining at times.  Shot entirely on Location on Long Island, Maine this film has some great ""b-roll"" cinematography as well.",1444953600,,331,4.892857142857143
8459121,1,B00561BNCW,"Really, I cannot give this even two stars even tho my heart screams out to be kind.

This movie is ... well... to BE kind, one I will NEVER watch again.  I like to purposely select ""bad"" movies now and again, and I am in that phase.  But usually I find at least a few redeeming factors in them.

Sadly, this was not the case with this film.  Not only was the music annoying and misplaced (as another reviewer pointed out) but other effects were just as bad - the ""echoing"" of statements the characters made as they came closer to their destination, the ""drama"" of one of the lead characters and her bad marriage, and the ""history"" of the place to be investigated.

SPOILERISH, IF IT CAN REALLY BE CALLED THAT IN THIS CASE ------

The movie ends up going nowhere.  They all arrive, talk to a realtor, go to the house, blather on a bit about nothing in particular, and it all adds up to nothing, really.  I guess there was supposed to be a ""climax"" at least of sorts, but I never felt it.  It just seemed to end on the biggest BLAH note in history.

And yes, the acting was BAD.  Wooden, poorly done, the whole amateur works. While this is understandable to a degree, this problem was made worse by the dialogue.  Using phrases like, ""Don't you know, my dear?"", which is usually professional and comes off well did not come off well at all when the person delivering the line is incapable of doing so.  It feels and sounds like it was read dead-pan off of a cue card.  And that impression was there all along.  Cue-card feel, wooden acting, dialog that was bad, but better than the acting, and all the little plot lines that went absolute nowhere.  It was like a bad rip-off of the Winchester Mystery House.  At least that place has real mystery and appeal.  This film has none.

I feel rather guilty giving this the lowest possible rating because at the end it is shown to be dedicated to a beloved friend who had passed on.  But I could not even rate it higher due to that.

If you like bad movies, please, by all means see them!  I do - all the time. But this is bad taken to a whole new level.  And I almost NEVER say that.",1373932800,10,2125,4.241895261845387
8459122,2,B00561BNCW,"From MaximMedia is this Ghost Story about a Haunted House...Blah,Blah-But wait it's a sequel to an episode of a series not seen since 1959.

The original `Captain's Guest' is more about this painting posessing a new man( owner) in the house,Well in Back To The Beyond--There is a new reality show that gets affected by the painting and it's limping ghost.

There is a lot of character development of the P.A.R.A Team characters and some of it goes somewhere plot wise and some of it not.

In research, It is revealed years later DARK SHADOWS would borrow similar points for a ""Quentin"" story line and AMITYVILLE HORROR also had some of these borrowed elements.

Not sure why,But technically on film quality,There are some blurs in reproduction quality.",1314748800,8,752,4.897637795275591
