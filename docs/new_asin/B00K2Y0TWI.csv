6401675,5,B00K2Y0TWI,My daughter LOVES Sophia the First so when this one came out I knew she would love it. She especially loves that a Princess that is already familiar is featured in each of the DVDs. This particular one included a mirror. And not a cheapy one either. I seems to be a very nice heavy duty mirror. Any little girl would enjoy this especially if they enjoy Sophia the First.,1408579200,4,370,4.3

8655472,5,B00K2Y0TWI,"Sofia The First The Enchanted Feast is a dvd set that is uplifting to watch and tells a thoughtful story about the power of unity. Plots began to unfold when Sofia gets the feeling that a beautiful sorceress is different from what she appears the moment she reaches for a piece of jewelry that holds some significance to her. However, as the sorceress has gifts to charm and enchant Sofias parents and even the royal sorcerer are at first taken in by this woman who calls herself Sasha. An uplifting animated film to watch for all ages and there is a trailer for Tinkerbell and the legend of the Neverbeast along with a free mirror and 4 other episodes. The character of Snow White makes an appearance in one of the episodes of this film.",1530403200,,738,4.474074074074074
