3411743,5,B00186DF48,"My two and a half year old son loves Charlie and Lola.  I love the sweet relationship between the two characters.  It's imaginative, fun and the characters are always polite and respectful.

I have often been frustrated by the lack of information available regarding which episodes appear on each DVD, and have always appreciated it when other reviewers list the episodes.  So here they are:

1. More Minutes
2. I am Collecting a Collection
3. Welcome to Lolaland
4. I Want to Draw Exactly More Like You
5. I Will Not Ever Never Forget You Nibbles (aired only a few times on Playhouse Disney)
6. Never Ever Never Step on the Cracks

Hope this helps!",1226966400,44,649,4.6
3411744,5,B00186DF48,"This show is brilliant.  My almost-2 year old daughter LOVES Charlie and Lola.  She constantly asks to ""watch chalie, ohwa."" Thankfully, this is one show that my husband and I don't mind having to watch over and over and over. Actually, we're quite entertained by it too. I love that Charlie (the older brother) has endless patience for his little sister Lola and he enjoys helping her learn new things. Their imaginations take them and their friends across ""the whole universe and world."" The british terminology appeals to me and Lauren Child's artisic style is just too cute for words.  Some episodes are more entertaining for my daughter than others, but all-in-all, the entire series is great.",1226793600,,698,4.948717948717949

3411746,5,B00186DF48,It's so wonderful to find children's videos that aren't mind numbingly boring or overly violent. These are intelligent and entertaining. Both my 5 year old and my 8 year old sons love them.,1221436800,4,189,4.757575757575758
3411747,5,B00186DF48,This DVD good for children ages 4-7 because the story is simple & meaning. My daughter likes it very much and I like the English accent.,1220832000,,136,4.269230769230769

3411749,5,B00186DF48,"Charlie and Lola provides such a wonderful view of the world - that everyone has issues and concerns but there are always people there to help.  It's fun to watch the characters work out solutions together in such a sweet and loving way.  Nice price, arrived quickly.",1384905600,,267,4.659574468085107
3411750,5,B00186DF48,"Not only is it a wonderful show for children, but my husband and I enjoy watching it with our children as well! LOVE THIS SHOW AND WISH THAT THEY'D START MAKING NEW EPISODES AGAIN!!!",1362700800,,182,4.382352941176471
3411751,5,B00186DF48,"As a parent I just LOVE these characters because the older brother is always pretty positive with his little sister.  It teaches understanding and patience, but the voices are so sweet I don't mind hearing them on repeat.  We were bummed when Disney cancelled their show so we started buying the DVDs.  Each DVD contains multiple episodes which is great.  My kids love them and frequently ask to watch Charlie and Lola!  I let them because their isn't that obnoxious humor you can find in some kids videos. The story lines rely heavily on the characters using their imagination too, which is another great lesson.",1330732800,,613,4.8
3411752,5,B00186DF48,It's Charlie and Lola. And is just as good as the rest of the dvds in the series. Delightful and funny.,1295308800,,103,3.9523809523809526
3411753,5,B00186DF48,Charlie and Lola has continued to put out very comical and genius approaches to childhood issues. My five year old has been watching these two characters for two years now and she never tires of them. Whats even better is I really enjoy watching them with her. Her 8 year old cousin also loves watching these with us when visiting. We plan to add more to our collection!,1276128000,,370,4.455882352941177
3411754,5,B00186DF48,"Charlie and Lola is a truly wonderful show.  Unlike the typical preschool show there isn't a math lesson or letters to practice.  It just shows the joy of childhood, the way it was meant to be!  My 4 year old loves it and now my 2 1/2 niece is getting into it as well.  It's a shame that Playhouse Disney only airs this great show once a week in our area.",1252368000,3,355,3.9577464788732395

3411756,5,B00186DF48,"This is a wonderful, no frills, cute, and well studied series, between the relationships between sibling.  Charlie is Lola's bigger brother, and has a boatload of patience to his sisters constant demands, and questions.  Very british, but is loved by all kids, and my little one (5) has taken it to pre-school, and all her friends (girls) loved it.

Only problem with this..it gets played repeatidly, over and over, to the point you have a twitch..best to hide it from time to time.

But secretly..I love it",1235952000,,507,4.793103448275862
3411757,5,B00186DF48,"My two year old loves the characters and I like that they represent good values and positive relationships. I would compare it to another cartoon sibling group that features bunnies (Max and Ruby), this cartoon makes her look forward to the new baby on the way versus the other does not.",1231977600,,287,4.647058823529412
