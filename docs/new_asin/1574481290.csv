In That's A Family, children articulately explain their family structures and what they would like their peers to understand about them. What does it mean to be have been adopted? Why are my parents different skin colors? How can I have two moms and no dad? Why do I only have a father? Why do my brother and I live with our grandmother and not our mom? Why did my parents get divorced? We have seen thousands of new teachers think about how to create a classroom environment that supports every child, from any kind of family. Anyone who wants to understand or work with children today needs tools to ensure that every child feels welcomed and validated. That's A Family! is the perfect film to help do that.",1402358400,,958,4.53757225433526

7798623,5,1574481290,"I think that this film will help kids understand that not all families have to have a mom, dad and kids. Some families have two moms or two dads, or live with an aunt, uncle or grandparent. Steffi, age 10

The film is really cool. I never knew what a guardian was. I thought it was some guy with a sword to protect you, but now I know its a person who helps take care of you, or takes care of you altogether. Kyle, age 11

I didn't think the families in the film were different from ordinary families. I know because my family is different. I don't get treated different, but some kids do. I think a family is when people love and care about each other. Shannon, age 8

My favorite part of the movie is seeing people that are adopted like me. I think this movie should be shown at my school because people get teased at my school. Matt, age 8

I was very impressed with the way it told children what a family really means instead of just what the stereotype of family is. Sonja, age 11

I have never ever seen a childrens program that explained or even said anything about lesbian or gay issues. I believe that this is probably one of the most important subjects you could have covered.  Sylvia, age 12

I related to this movie a lot because it seems Ive gone through just about all of those situations. Right now, Im living with my mother and stepdad. About seven years ago, I lived with just my mom. And when I was about two, I lived with my mom and her boyfriend, who was Mexican and black. The video made me have good and bad memories. It was cool. Erika, age 10

I think the single-parent family was the best because rarely do I hear about them in school. Rarely are they even mentioned. Kendall, age 10

I have nothing against gays, lesbians, separated or no kind of biracial families. I think that your film will help a lot of people out with their problems against these types of people. Krissy, age 11",1399939200,,1910,4.239669421487603
7798624,5,1574481290,"I bought this film ages ago, thinking it would be interesting to my child when she started grade school to promote tolerance, diversity of families, etc. Little did I know that our family would go through a divorce. I started playing this DVD for her, and she loved it because it is kids talking to her as another kid. I loved it because it explains things like divorce in simple, matter of fact ways (sometimes I'm at my mom's house, and sometimes I'm at my dad's house) while also explaining other family structures. It highlights that the main thing is love in the family. The film normalizes the idea that families may look or function differently, and sometimes there are changes, but that it is love that makes a family. I have not personally found another film that touches on divorce so well for children.",1393200000,,813,4.613793103448276

""That's a Family! is a superb video production. It provides a wealth of material that can produce hours of productive conversation about the many ways in which people become families. The use of children speaking in their own voices about their experience of family is especially successful. I heartily recommend this video.""
--Don-David Lusterman, PhD, fellow, Academy of Family Psychology

""It is delightful to see that someone is able to give a realistic portrayal of the changing face of the American family. With the honesty and sincerity of the children's voices, That's a Family! shows how we are all different, but that the true definition of family is one in which there is love.""
--Evelyn K. Moore, president, National Black Child Development Institute

""Entertaining and fast-paced, That's a Family! is also honest and instructive, explaining difficult, often-confusing terms such as lesbian, mixed-race and adoption, and stressing that love and support - not blood or skin color - hold families together.""
