6546448,5,B00M1CFX4S,"Totally did not expect to like this film as much as I did. The pacing and directing was just right with some really solid performances. You have to figure out what the hell is going on and that's what I liked about it. I still don't know, to be honest, but it makes for great discussion. It wasn't the typical thriller/horror/mystery flick. It left a lot of people trashing this film, because it did not let you know what happened. The tension was great throughout and I loved the setting and atmosphere. Overall, I really enjoyed this film.",1505865600,,541,4.530612244897959

6546451,5,B00M1CFX4S,"This film is amazing. Just the right amount of suspense,mystery and horror to keep you on the edge of your seat. A creepy,uneasy feeling builds up like something out of an old Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode. The end keeps you wondering what exactly was happening to these people? Victims of some sort of psychological experiment that threw off their perception? It's quite apparent towards the end, that they are being observed by someone or something. The lights suddenly go out, just as the two remaining friends decide they will stare into each others eyes, till help arrives. Or was it something atmospheric ? The abrupt unseasonable temperature fluctuations. No birds or insects around. Did they wander into some sort of an inter-dimensional vortex,that seemed to mess with time? Almost Bermuda Triangle like,with people vanishing into thin air. If you like stories like this,then you will love this movie. It does not disappoint.",1500681600,,942,5.123376623376624

6546453,5,B00M1CFX4S,One of my favorite movies. I know some don't like it because there is no rhyme or reason or even a killer. But it's the simplicity that I like. I could watch thus on repeat all day.,1496102400,,181,3.918918918918919

6546458,4,B00M1CFX4S,"This movie appears to be made so viewers will watch it more than once, and to set up a sequel that will explain everything. I've seen two movies like this where it is a killer's dream sequence. This movie could also be science fiction, but the two warnings that viewers see (on the mirror and in the furniture), but the characters do not see, make me think it is more a murder mystery, possibly involving the couple at the end (Green & Kelly). The noose hanging from the ceiling is the most confusing part of the movie, as well as the phone ringing near the end. Why didn't someone look for a phone or computer right off the bat? Anyway, I hope a sequel is coming.",1479254400,,664,4.277777777777778

6546464,5,B00M1CFX4S,"This is a completely different kind of film. I've found myself fascinated by the premise. It's a sort of science fiction take off of Agatha Christie's most famous novel ""And Then There Were None"" (aka ""Ten Little Indians""). Ten people at a remote lodge for a relaxing weekend find the lodge empty, but many clues around that people had disappeared before they got there.

6546470,4,B00M1CFX4S,"While not sure as to how to truly ""label"" this film... it's definitely a worth watching movie. The characters are varied and balance out with each other. I don't want to give it away so I will write what I was thinking as I watched it. This is the type of movie I personally think is best to see without reading the promo. Watch it that way and you will understand why. At first it seems TOO peaceful, ... and yes it is... at first. It doesn't take long however for the viewer (and characters) to realize something's amiss. The bully kid from ""A Christmas Story"" is all grown up and plays a major role in the film as is also Mena Suvari. All in all a good watch. Keep the lights off for maximum enjoyment.",1460592000,3,705,4.1911764705882355
6546471,5,B00M1CFX4S,"Very original... in a ""Dr Who"" sort of way!
Great build up...
hardly any special effects that distract from the story.
The story if full of holes... but, most science fiction stories are full of holes!

I loved how the seasons outside ""changed"" when there were no being observed.
How I understood the ending: Spoiler:

The total lack of animal and insect life coupled with the impossible weather shifts (an iced-over lake).

My theory is that there was more than one single phenomenon going on at the same time!
One ""core"" anomaly cause the other smaller anomalies.

The story does fall apart at the end.
There was a small clue in the movie at bad haired blonde guy pulls a piece of glass out of his hand. I think if they would have walked away from the cabin, they would have found three wrecked cars.
They were all dead and simply ""fading out"".
The glass in his hand was from a windshield.
If this is the case, it neatly explains the bazillion paramedics who are seen outside.

6546473,5,B00M1CFX4S,I loved this movie for two main reasons. It was unique & different. There is no other Horror movie out like it right now. It Let's you use your Imagination & draw your own conclusions. I mean think about it. If they had come up with some lame reason why people were disappearing it would have been a crappy movie. So thumbs up for me. I also watched this movie because I'm a Brian Austin Green fan i use to watch him on 90210. I Like Horror that's not gory. Gory is not scary it's just gross. This movie was not gory or gross & for me that's a major plus..,1455062400,,556,4.018018018018018
6546474,1,B00M1CFX4S,"Wow, the director of this movie should disappear like the cast in this movie lol. So the plot of this movie is...wait, it doesn't have one! It just shows a group of people that slowly start disappearing one-by-one (in the blink of an eye), until they're all gone. That's it! No WHY, WHAT or HOW. No story, no plot, nothing. Just people slowly disappearing over 2 hours.

6546477,4,B00M1CFX4S,Good suspenseful movie. It was well acted and movie was intriguing. Good cast. I like horror movies that are not all gore. I would give this 5 stars but the ending is open ended and really does not give you a definitive answer of what was actually happening to the characters.,1452988800,,276,4.431372549019608
6546478,5,B00M1CFX4S,"I loved this movie.  Don't care about the negatives out there.  It was very suspenseful and full of stuff that we watching the movie are busy shaking our heads at the things they do.  Surely, they've seen scary movies before?  Get in the car and go!  The one thing that had me going, ""uh-uh no way dude"" was at the end when help comes and they all storm into the cabin and disappear.  Now as someone who works with law enforcement that was pretty hard for me to swallow.  So I am in agreement with others who would like to see a Don't Blink 2 and give some sort of resolution to how that many people can disappear all at once, when during the whole of the movie it was one at a time.  Otherwise, my suspension of disbelief is alive and well for the rest of the movie.  Can I just say that I always watch the gas gauge and cell phone reception and hope to never be in any situation like that?",1449187200,,891,4.074712643678161
6546479,1,B00M1CFX4S,"Independent Horror films are always hit or miss, there is no in-between. They are either better than any Hollywood movie or as awful as a film can be, Don't Blink is part of the latter. Ten friends in four cars go away on vacation, to a small resort village in the middle of nowhere. When the group arrives they are shocked to find, the town is abandoned, so why don't they just leave? All four cars are low on gas and of course the pumps at the only gas station in town don't work, for that matter neither do any of their cell phones, what are the odds? I don't know about you, but if I was in the situation, I'd run away as fast as I could, but these geniuses decide to huddle up in the main cabin and hope for the best. As they try to keep calm, members of their party start to vanish, one by one, in the blink of an eye, and soon, the group descends into madness. The whole premise of this film is ridiculous and the budget is so small, that most of the film is shot in the same location. As far as what's happening to them, don't think you'll ever find out, because that is supposedly the scariest part of the whole thing. Don't Blink, sounds like it would be fast paced and exciting, but it's as slow as can be, with a lot of talking, by a lot of stupid people, who are in a situation that would never happen. The dialogue is amateurish, the bad acting is the only real joke in the film, and the ending makes the whole thing just a complete waste of time. Even though I see movies like this from time to time, I'm still amazed that someone thought that something like this deserved to made into a feature film, and I continue to wonder if anyone reads these scripts before producing the film.",1446249600,,1698,4.148484848484848

6546481,4,B00M1CFX4S,"First of all, as one reviewer put it, if you want a neat, tidy ending, this movie is not for you.  In reading all of the reviews, it appears to me that the point here is missed - as in Rod Serling's Twilight Zone series, the point isn't always the ending or the why.  It's what happens during the event, how human nature works and reacts. I do like a neat, tidy ending....but take this movie for what it is.  If the writer/director wanted to give a creepy story focusing on human nature and the unknown, he rocked it.  If not, well, he fell down on the job.  There are a few things that are pretty trite (message on the mirror and in a cabinet), but overall it was a decent creepy movie.",1442880000,,687,4.135338345864661
6546482,4,B00M1CFX4S,"No, there IS no explanation to what is happening, but we actually like a mystery!  We like not being spoon-fed everything that is going on.  This movie keeps you in suspense as to what is happening to these people as one by one they disappear.  I don't know which is worse:  the fear of being left alone or the fear of going next!  The tension is great, the scenery & the lodge is absolutely beautiful, the acting is very good, and it is simply scary.  There are no monsters to see ( or to disappoint us)just real fear.  It is the kind of movie I keep watching every time I see that it is on cable.  Just plain fun!",1441929600,8,615,4.109243697478991

6546484,1,B00M1CFX4S,"Stupid, really! No real plot, the conversations lingered, no explanation of why any of the things were going on even though one of the victims was a scientist who spent her days and nights studying and all she could come up with was there were no birds or bugs near the cabin and that was during the first part of the film. Even more misleading are the two actors on the cover of the dvd who aren't the draws of the plot. Just another horror film that let me down",1439856000,,463,4.155555555555556
6546485,1,B00M1CFX4S,"Remember that movie The Vanishing on 7th Street? Yeah?

Well, it's the same thing but in a cabin. And somehow, it makes less sense.

But DERP! It's supposed to be interpretive! I guess.

It's a plodding waste of time that ultimately goes nowhere before abruptly ending with absolutely nothing having been accomplished.

Again, the filmmakers just took The Vanishing on 7th Street and set it in a cabin with worse results.",1439769600,,421,4.887323943661972
6546486,4,B00M1CFX4S,"Don't Blink is sort of a cheap way of providing a storyline.  It's about blinking and showing people disappear.  I mean that literally.  They really disappear!  Vanish into thin air!  They're gone!  You get the idea.  I can't deny it's a cheap gimmick.  This means all the story has to do is show someone disappear the moment their friends turn their backs, and that's exactly what happens.  Soemtimes it's done in a clever way (like when Emelie O'Hara's character disappears behind the refrigerator door the moment their friends turn away- clever because of the camera angle too) but other times, such as when Brian Austin Green's girlfriend disappears on the bed after they make love and he turns around... those ones aren't so great.

I feel the movie had potential in other areas but didn't quite explain the events in detail.  I wanted to know why these people were disappearing, and what was causing it to happen.  Instead the closest explanation was unusual temperatures fluctuation, no birds or insects making sounds, and the people who're supposed to live in this remote house are nowhere to be found.  I was convinced some kind of monster or supernatural entity was behind this but... nothing was ever shown.  What a shame.  It's especially disappointing when a couple of the cast members even went exploring the mountain and noticed/wondered how the lake could be frozen over, and it dawned on them there's no birds chirping.  They even explored the ground for bugs and came up with nothing.  A missed opportunity, but the atmosphere in this scene was tremendous at least.

I actually think Zack Ward's character was the most memorable one.  I know the popular answer is Brian Austin Green or Joanne Kelly because, well, I won't say why (but then again I think all the young chicks would find Brian attractive) but Zack was awesome because at first he seemed like a party animal and a vulnerable nerd, but with each disappearance he'd gradually get nuttier and lose control because he couldn't explain where everyone went.  It gets to the point he loses his mind.  Great writing.  Emelie O'Hara was the second best character because she's just so perky and cute.

Now there's a big problem I haven't mentioned yet.  The first 45 minutes is downright boring to watch (with the exception being the missed opportunity moment I mention above- the one moment of excellence in the entire first half).  Nothing really of note happens.  They stumble upon a house, explore it, talk about their problems, and try to figure out why the conditions are so quiet.  Also, the movie starts with John Denver's ""Rocky Mountain High"".  I know another horror movie had a fascination with this song and played it constantly but I forget which one, and I'm sort of thinking the writers of Don't Blink had to be aware of this.

Overall, if you're willing to be patient you might find yourself rewarded with a significantly better second half.  If you don't want to wait that long, I can hardly blame you.  My 4-star rating is generous.  At least the ending is eerie.  It might not be satisfying, but I liked it.  Oh and I'm sure some people will find a contradiction in the movie title and the fact these characters blink quite often, but I'm more forgiving since it's human nature to blink constantly.",1439251200,,3290,4.774822695035461
6546487,1,B00M1CFX4S,"The film had some potential.  There were a couple of good actors, though most were just awful.  I waited and waited to see what good twist the ending would have since the plot seemed pretty good.  But, the ending was the biggest letdown imaginable.  No logic, no explanation, no reasons, not even a plausible end to the thing.  As the movie went, so was the ending.  At the first horror event, they may as well have ended the movie there because it does not ever change or explain the reasons for the events, even at the end.  The ending makes absolutely no sense, and leaves you hanging with the question, ""That's IT???""  Don't buy; don't watch; don't bother!",1438992000,2,660,4.533898305084746

This isn't one that relies on jump scares, creature effects, gore, or anything of the sort. This movie was all about the atmosphere that it builds up. It was very original, in fact the closest I can think to compare it to was Vanishing on 7th Street...and I loved that movie.
A fairly large group of friends heads into the mountains for a camping trip, but when they arrive at the resort lodgings they find cars in the parking lot but no people anywhere. It doesn't take long before they realize there are also no birds, insects, or animals of any kind in the surrounding area either. With gas pumps that aren't working they have no way to fill up their cars and leave, so they opt to stay where they are only to begin disappearing one after another. In the middle of conversation or while in the midst of doing something, the person simply vanishes, clothing and all.
There is no explanation given for what is happening, no investigation to speak of by the group that is dwindling in size, just terror and discomfort as they wait to see who is next to go.
It was well-executed enough to manage pulling off an eerie quality that kept me watching and waiting, just like the characters, to see what might happen next.
It's not a scary movie, but it is unsettling and spooky in a way that I enjoyed very much...and the ending was suitably desolate to feel like it was fulfilling.",1431820800,,1647,4.456953642384106

6546495,4,B00M1CFX4S,"The story deals with a paranormal or supernatural uncertainty that builds creates an unnatural creepy atmosphere almost from the start. Okay the start is actually a concerted, cheese feast intro. At least that is how it felt to me, it actually sets the tone and gives us our characters backstory without taking up a lot of dialog in the main story. A story that is freaky, built into societys psyche based on religious mythology, and alien mythos alike.

The acting in Dont Blink is pretty tight, most of the cast give strong performances bringing clich characters together in one disturbing experience. At times it does feel a bit too polished and insincere, but that is just because such attention has been paid to piecing this film together as perfect as possible. A task that is manages pretty d*mn nicely  in my opinion. The characters are relatable on some level, yeah they are stereotypes but they personalities are so individually blended that the clich seems somewhat elevated to a more modern equivalent.

Dont Blink uses mostly practical effects, with camera tricks for the obvious main horror element of the film. For every practical effect scene everything works to create a gruesome, disturbing raw moment. It elevates the very dramatically driven story, and terrifying reality of these characters. Again this is a testament to the cast and crews strength to produce a quality film. The soundtrack was a bit ineffective in pushing the psychological profile of the story into the necessary areas of unease that the subject matter and acting demand. That is not to say that it doesnt serve to carry the storys emotional component through the film.",1431475200,,1659,4.981949458483754

No spoilers here, because the movie doesn't end that way. But it should have! It would have been a better ending. I'm sure Mr. Oates was smoking a nickel bag of dirt weed and drinking some cheap bargain wine when he wrote this. I saw the ending coming a mile away and fast-forwarded thru the last half hour.

6546503,4,B00M1CFX4S,"It's scary, it's suspenseful, it's tense...what it doesn't do is give an explanation for why it happens.

A group of young people go to a mountain lodge for a getaway. They find it deserted and one by one they also disappear.  Of course most want to turn tail and use what little gas they have left to go back the way they came but for some reason when it comes to a vote, they decide to stay. Of course we, the audience, know this is not only a bad move but a completely stupid one.

That's the plot in a nutshell.  The characters are the usual ones...the more down-to-earth than the others young couple, the ex with her new boyfriend, the singles who would've begin paring off if disaster hadn't struck. Of course the cells don't work, although--surprise!--the house phone does and they manage to get out a distress call but rescue can't arrive for 3 hours.  At least that bit was different.  But can they last three more hours?

This story plays on the human fear of being left alone...as one by one the others disappear...and all it takes is to take your eyes off someone. On a couple of occasions this effect is done in complete view of the camera and it's a little unnerving.  Waiting to see who'll be next and how it'll happen is the ""shaking up"" part.

There's nothing really new in this movie and the ending is a big let-down but in between there are some scary scenes and a good deal of tension. So...if you want logic, don't watch this.

The basic plot line is a group of people head for a remote mountain retreat for some R&R and get there to find it deserted. Their cars are all but out of gas so they are pretty much stuck there.

One by one they just disappear. I guess you blink and another person just disappears, so Don't Blink.

It makes for a better movie than some reviews have given it credit for. I did not expect a lot from it given the number of mediocre and poor reviews it got, but was pleasantly surprised by it.

Dont Blink is a very ambitious movie. Whether you like it or not, you have to admit that. Ten young travelers arrive at a remote mountain resort for vacation. To their great surprise, no one is there, and the place is deserted as if suddenly vanished. Not only that; the visitors, now trapped there, are also disappearing one after another without a trace.

The premise looks like that of a typical low-budget horror with some monsters or killers hiding somewhere. This doesnt happen in Dont Blink, a unique film in blending the Agatha Christie-like mystery (you may notice references to her classic And Then There Were None) and supernatural horror, in which humans are threatened by the unknown entity.

I see the point, and writer/director Travis Oates has considerable skills for setting up spooky atmosphere. Even so, the forced premise (no cellphones, no cars with gas, etc.) and the lack of closure (or any hint about what really happened) are only frustrating, especially after several effective scares.",1420156800,2,1038,5.094117647058823

The biggest kind of bait & switch in movie-making history.  Tell a completely impossible story, one that will have your audience on the edge of their seats, even with the so-so acting, even with the ridiculously predictable one liners, flirtations, and so forth - the viewers will keep watching to find out what exactly is going on.  Because nothing they can think of would explain what is happening!  They will keep watching for an hour, maybe two, JUST to find out what is going on!  And then --- don't explain!!!

6546524,2,B00M1CFX4S,"This is my first movie review and I do not claim to be an expert, by any means.  Having said that, I will assert that is was a very disappointing ""horror"" movie.  I caught it on Netflix one Saturday morning when the dog got me up at the crack of dawn and I had a couple of hours before the family and house woke up.  So I thought, ""I'll sit here with my coffee and knitting and indulge in a scary movie.""  Sweet.

At first I was relieved this wasn't one of those truly stupid bunch o' over-sexed teenagers going to a haunted cabin movies.  It was a group of marginally intelligent young adults going to a fancy mountain lodge movies.  Still, the f-word was abundant, something I hate.  Nevertheless, I kept watching mainly because Mena Suvari was in it and I figured it had to have some redeeming value b/c she's a pretty well-known actress.

The basic premise is that upon arrival (and all 3 cars out of gas after the hours-long trip - thus shattering all hopes of a quick escape), the 10 friends find the lodge silent and empty; yet, there is evidence that other visitors had recently been there - full plates of food in the dining room, a half-full baby bottle in a guest room upstairs, a hot pan on the stove.  Furthermore, the smart, science-y girl (naturally without makeup and sporting thick glasses) realized that even the outdoors is beyond silent.  No birds, no insect pupae (which she explains to Zach Ward of A Christmas Story fame) hibernating in the dirt and an abandoned fishing boat in the middle of the frozen lake.

As the friends re-gather and come to the realization that something weird is going on, they slowly, one by one, just disappear.  This goes on for an hour and a half during which time Zach Ward's character becomes crazier, meaner and more violent.  Scut Farkus lives.  He gets his own in the end, though.

The ending is what spurned me to write a review.  The bottom line is that you never find out why people disappear or what the cause is.  Very frustrating and stupid.  Whenever something like this happens it always seems to me that the writer has run out of ideas and cannot formulate an ending.  I guess it could have been worse.  Travis Oates (the writer/director) could have pulled the ""it was all a bad dream"" card, a la Bobby's dream in Dallas - and I know the young readers will have not idea what I'm talking about.

I should have realized it was all downhill when the star (Suvari) was the first to disappear within the first 20 min. of the movie.  Even she knew it was stinker.",1419638400,2,2524,4.427331887201736

But N of the LD was a terrific movie in that sense. This felt contrived, they start losing their tempers on their arrival before they even know they are in any danger.

They could have done a lot more with the beautiful location and snow and I thought afterwards that the one who survived was the one who had said she was only going up there to ""be alone"". They could have done something with that too. And who were the guys ""doing a sweep""? It's like part of the plot is missing. Maybe they just tore out random pages. People disappeared in no particular order.

Not sure why the ""Don't blink"" warning. It didn't seem to help anybody and they don't even see it till the end. Did the people who were shot also disappear even when they were dead? They seemed to still be there. for a while anyway.

A bunch of young adults whose personalities are quickly poorly developed find themselves stranded at a remote location where it appears everyone just suddenly disappeared...as well as the birds, the bugs and the kitties, leaving behind pieces of cold burnt toast, clearly a clue a former Waffle House worker is involved.

As our party starts to disappear the remaining characters become more irrational but not any more entertaining. Everyone who is left suspects the creepy Noah (David de Lautour) is a demonic alien or something who and knows what is happening...

It seems the biggest rant against the film is that there is no closure...but there are clues. Note the license plate on Noah's car ""666- PPP."" ""PPP"" is an upside down 666 and could be a clue as the only way you can watch the film is upside down...or not. The original title of the film was ""Last Stop."" Again a clue. Jack (nickname for Satan) insists they stay. Clue?

The film is just filled with clues....Help me.

I really don't need closure, I just wished the characters were developed better and Fiona Gubelmann disappeared after taking a shower.

I have seen foreign movies that don't really have a resolution or conclusion but that's how they do things. Is this movie trying to emulate a foreign concept? Perhaps, but they didn't do a good job. Most foreign movies don't end at the pinnacle of the story, unless there is a sequel. They may not explain the who, what, why and how but there is some sort of conclusion. This story just ended right when we should have been given the what and why of the story. Because of that I cannot give this movie more than 2 stars.

6546589,1,B00M1CFX4S,"If you like movies that have no explainable ending, then this is the movie for YOU.  This is so disappointing because there is a great plot, surprisingly great acting, and great character development.  Some people have compared this to an Agatha Christie story or even Hitchcock, but don't buy it.  Now I know some people will say that ""The Birds"" didn't explain why birds went nuts and they'd be right, but it's a great story with a satisfying ending.  But ""Don't Blink"" is more like ""Psycho"" if it ended where Norman made his last kill and no explanation of why Norman did what he did.  A group of ""adults"" go to a mountain retreat.  Not one of them decide to fill the gas tank, but just have enough to get there and a few miles back.  There are a number of MacGuffins or red herrings in this movie, but I'd rather not say it if you really plan to watch this.  Something strange is going on because there is no one else at the lodge.  There are no animal noises or any noises.  There are half-eaten meals.  You almost start to think ""Langoliers"", and that might have made sense if the writer had chosen to create a real ending.  People in the group start disappearing one by one.  There is a torture scene that really shows the character of these people.  Is it supernatural horror?  Is it Sci-Fi?  Who knows?  You won't know either.  Even after the last scene plays out.  Some movies work well when they end without a true ending, but this isn't one of them.  This movie is tense and gripping.  This is great acting and great writing, but why the writer gave up and didn't supply a REAL ending is beyond me. And more and more current movies are doing this as though they could be Hitchcock or Spielberg.  Hell, this is even devoid of a Shymalian ending. If I want to create my own ending, I'll write my own movie.  And if you think your stuff is so damn great, then tell the audience at the beginning that you don't have an explainable ending and we can decide if we want to waste our money.  And if anyone thinks this type of ending is artsy, then you need to rip out the last chapter of any book you've read or skip the last 5 minutes of any movie you've watched and see if you enjoy that.

6546596,4,B00M1CFX4S,"I really didn't expect much going into Don't Blink.  Seeing as how my expectations were fairly low, this movie surpassed them.  However, I do feel as though I should put a disclaimer: if you're one of those people who likes things fairly explained and/or wrapped up (and that's not a slam to anyone. I can take vague in movies, but it drives me absolutely batty if it's in a book), then don't watch this movie because you will be disappointed.  Another disclaimer: I'm fairly easy when it comes to movies.  I need a movie that keeps my interest all the way through, one that's fairly entertaining, and one that has some funny parts.  Don't Blink did this, so I consider it a win.

As a suspense movie, Don't Blink is pretty effective.  I didn't find it at all scary, but I don't think that was the point of this film.  The isolation in the film did get to me, though.  I also have to mention that considering that you know very little about these characters that are disappearing, it's incredibly easy to root for most of them and want them to get out of their current predicament.  But I think all of that has to do with the tremendous acting in this film.

Everyone in Don't Blink was just spot on.  Nothing upsets me more in a film than bad acting (especially in a suspense or horror film) and I was pleasantly surprised at how good everyone was.  However, no one was more impressive in this film than Joanne Kelly.  Now I'm a Warehouse 13 fan so I already knew how good she was, but even I was stunned by how amazing her acting was in this film.  Towards the end, I just kept thinking ""How is she not more well-known? How is she not in more movies?""

Anyway, so I found Don't Blink to be a pretty good film.  Yes, it's vague as hell, so if that bothers you, steer clear.  If unanswered questions don't bug you, then check this movie out.  It's definitely not as bad as you would think.",1412294400,4,1889,4.315340909090909

Unless you want to see Brian Austin Green's (presumably stunt double) butt, which was the highlight of the movie, you'll wind up hating yourself for not heeding this saintly warning.

The acting is actually OK, but the script was clearly written by someone who hates the world and wants it to suffer. An absolute dumpster fire of a movie.",1411430400,11,589,4.3545454545454545
6546620,5,B00M1CFX4S,"An excellent movie, with far more humor than I was expecting.  Well acted in its entirety, and Zack Ward in particular gives an amazing performance- showing what he can do when he's handed a script that really works.  Overall the film's tone is very tense, but with funny, tight dialogue that I loved.",1411344000,3,301,4.660377358490566
6546621,1,B00M1CFX4S,"I am totally convinced the good reviews are fake . This by far being one of the worst movies I have ever seen . What a horrible story line I was so bored . The cast stands outside for part of this movie , while people disappear they argue . Then they move into the lodge and the rest of the cast disappears . That's it that's the movie , no explanation , no climax , just a poorly written script . That is how it ends just with nothing tahst what they give you . I don't even understand the whole point of this story because there was none . Brian Austin Green 's cast and friends wrote these good reviews because for the life of me I don't think anyone could ever give this a good review  .",1411344000,6,691,3.9357142857142855
6546622,2,B00M1CFX4S,"Though the acting and cinematography are solid, this really is a fairly boring horror/sci-fi flick. Nothing much happens, there are a number of inconsistencies in the plot, and some character actions seem highly illogical. It just gets worse as it goes along and the problem is a bad script. Felt like a TV movie. Technically well-made but not even remotely scary, not worth the time or money.",1411257600,5,393,4.880597014925373
6546623,5,B00M1CFX4S,"Better-than-expected story and acting from a cast that will keep your eyes wide open! Where DO these people go, when they disappear? Yes, it's eerie, it's creepy and it's a blast! I would recommend for ages 16 and over. Great date flick, too!",1410825600,7,242,4.651162790697675

8669672,5,B00M1CFX4S,"what amazes me is that a lot of people loved this movie except for the ending and gave it one star because they weren't satisfied. This is not a jump scare type that most are. You actually have to use your imagination in this one. It's very Stephen King Langolier's-ish. The only problem in this one, they don't give you a monster. You have formulate your own. Aliens, dimension shift, Stranger things type creatures. It leaves you to formulate your own answers. It's been a long time since iv'e seen a movie that keeps you guessing til the last second. Well done. Don't be so sharp in thinking you were cheated. It will keep you on your toes",1527552000,,642,4.4491525423728815
8669673,4,B00M1CFX4S,"Spoilers: I really enjoyed the science fiction element of this film. It did leave you having to interpret the ending on your own. I enjoyed that for a change. It also left you with many questions that went unanswered. The biggest one for me was, why did the temperature drop so drastically. Alien abduction movie?
In the end it was eerie and kept my attention. I enjoyed it.",1527206400,,374,4.514705882352941

8669675,1,B00M1CFX4S,"You know those puke-awful SyFy original movies where what passes for dialog and dramatic interaction between the actors is nothing more than bickering and arguing and yelling at each other usually for no other reason than, well let's be honest, the film makers don't know how to write dialog!

But there's a bonus here! Foul language. Lots of it. F-bombs a go-go. And it's obvious that the actors are either uncomfortable about it or are just lamely ad libbing it. Took me completely out of the movie which just goes down hill about mid-way.",1522627200,,541,4.75531914893617

8669680,5,B00M1CFX4S,"I haven't seen Green, or Suvari in much in a while... seems they should be around much more.
Everyone of the characters are believable and have a crisp wit about them in their dialog, this makes their conversations enjoyable to listen to.
If you like suspense, this is good one and though the ending leaves you hanging, it was probably intended.",1506124800,,345,4.672131147540983
