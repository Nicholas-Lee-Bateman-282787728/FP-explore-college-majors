About 2 1/2 years ago, Season #16 of The Ultimate Fighter kicked off, and immediately, even before the elimination fights started, Roy Nelson pissed off Dana White. ""Big Country"" said that if you win your fights, that's the goal. Dana immediately spoke up, saying that he didn't just want the fighters to win, he wanted IMPRESSIVE FIGHTS! So, the eliminations began, and there were brutal knock outs, slick, sneaky submissions, and a few decisions that nobody cared to live a 2nd time, but that's the way it went. Hey, even Forrest Griffin had his BJJ Coach, Cameron Diffley, competing as a contestant, who won his elimination fight by quick submission. How bad could it truly get? Did Roy really mess things up by saying, ""Just win!""?

Well, the answer to that was that once the fighters got into the house, decision after decision pursued, and while some of the fights might have been worth watching over, not all of the fights were all that great, and a lot of them ended up being MAJORITY decisions, which is kind of unheard of these days in MMA, even in 2 round fights, but not in TUF. Interesting. But ALSO, the kid that was accused of fighting a cheap fight to get into the house, Colton Smith, actually fought FIGHT OF THE SEASON against Eddy Ellis, and it really was a good fight. It actually baffles me to this day, WHY Ellis never got to make his UFC debut after his performance.

Where there should've been multiple knock outs, there was only one, and that man happened to be in the Finale. Where there probably should've been a few more submissions, there was only one, and he got bit in the process for his efforts. That guy made his UFC debut, only to lose a lackluster decision against Neil Magny in the preliminaries at UFC 157. That was his only fight.

THE FIGHTERS: Who would've figured that the TUF #16 Winner, Colton Smith, would only win ONE UFC fight...the Finale Fight that made him the Ultimate Fighter?! I'm pretty sure that's a first. There was a ton of controversy about Colton, his fight to get into the house, the fake glove touch, and I'm sorry to say, but I don't call that a dirty fight. When the ref says, ""Fight!!!,"" touching gloves IS good sportsmanship, but it shouldn't be first priority. Colton did what he had to to get into the house, and ultimately, he won it all. But tough fights against other TUF Winners,  #15 Winner, Michael Chiesa, and  TUF Smashes Winner, Robert Whittaker, and then getting tapped in under 40 seconds by Carlos Diego Ferreira, simply shows that Colton has some work to do before fighting with the UFC again. I do salute him for serving his country. Mike Ricci, runner-up in this whole thing, showed some stones, ultimately standing up his own fellow Canadian, and proving some all-around toughness, but so far going 1-2 with the UFC, and got released as well. Who would've figured that Neil Magny would turn his style into something that could actually knock out some tough fighters? I never would've figured that! But to this date, Magny is on a 5-fight winning streak, and has recently done so impressively. Sam Alvey is with the UFC, and is so far 1-1, and hopefully does what he can to stick around. Igor Araujo has proved to be a grinder, and a tough out, but has been KO'd in his only UFC loss, so far. I'd still love to see Eddy Ellis get his go-round in the Big Show, just because I think he deserves it. And oddly enough, Nic Herron-Webb, the kid who was somewhat immature, hopefully gets his opportunity, on a 3-fight W streak. I almost figured that Cameron Diffley would get an automatic gimme, simply being Forrest Griffin's boy, and despite an undefeated record, (4-0) I think I have to respect the fact that he isn't quite ready for UFC level competition.

Altogether, this wasn't what you'd call a horrible season. There was definitely a lot of potential. But when the Boss Man, Dana White, tells you he wants exciting fights, and your solution is to EEK out decisions, hoping to be in the Finale, you'd probably be best to put away the middle finger, and see what you can do about getting a KO or submission. Because certain attitudes on this season told Dana White, ""Up yours,"" and Dana didn't have to give them opportunities to begin with. And unfortunately, for certain people, this show was as far as they got. For a few of them, rightfully so!

In the end, the Finale was rather entertaining, and we got to find out what would happen if Matt Mitrione fought Roy Nelson in the Main Event of the Finale. If you're looking for interesting, you have just that in this season. If great fights are what you are expecting, well...you've been warned.",1419724800,,4830,4.608139534883721
8563351,2,B00B6OEDSE,"This was a very dull season and it had tons of potential. There were a lot of great fighters, you see a bunch of hard knock outs in the matches to get into the house. Then, during the elimination fights, the judges always chose to end the fight early. Thats boring! To add to my frustration, the coaches didn't really seem into it. They barely coached at all or did it without enthusiasm. Not a good season. Just save your money.",1412899200,,429,4.308641975308642

8563353,3,B00B6OEDSE,"This season is just entertaining drama wise because the fights are very crappy ( spoiler: most fights end in decision). these fighters had potential but you don't see the killer instinct in a lot of these fights plus a lot of bad judging and nelson was a bad coach pick because the dude talks crap and yet you don't see him barely make his fighters better
carwin was a way better coach than roy he had great assistant coaches and he had a better team
all in all I bought this just for the drama and just to add for my collection
PS after some bad judging calls some of these guys didn't get a shot in the ufc ( actually most of them didn't)",1383436800,,640,4.128
8563354,5,B00B6OEDSE,"Awesome!!!

Team carwin shows dedication, n fighting spirit

Team nelson shows what happens to a team w no leader

N the fight is magical!!!",1382140800,,140,4.75
8563355,4,B00B6OEDSE,"Anither season of ""Ultimate Fighter"".  Failry good coaches, obviously scripted drama, and then it ended.  But there's some good fights on this collection.",1372118400,,154,5.6521739130434785
