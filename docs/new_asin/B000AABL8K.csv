8076970,5,B000AABL8K,I love this film but I was of course the guy who made it. This film was commissioned by the Intrepid Museum specifically to document how they got that plane from Kennedy Airport to the Aircraft Carrier on the West Side of Manhattan. They were kind enough to allow me to tell the greater tail of Concorde and of course it's condensed as there is only a 56 minute window to tell it in. Yes I agree their are more detailed and technical films about this great aircraft. But this was an extraordinarily emotional experience for me as it was to everyone who was their at Kennedy when they shut it down for the last time and drained the fluids from it. The emotions from those mechanics and technicians who spent their lives keeping this thing flying was real.  It was truly the end of an era. There are some negative comments about my use of a female choir in this film. Yes it's melodramatic and it should be. Why? Well I'm amazed at how all the Concorde buffs missed the real reason behind using that music. I used it right as the plane was lifted from Kennedy Runway high into the air by crane and placed on a barge. That particular piece of music with the female voices was actually used in a number of British Airways commercials for Concorde in it's heyday. Give this film a chance there is quite a bit between the lines in their. Cheers.,1405555200,,1339,4.356
8076971,3,B000AABL8K,"If you are a die hard Concorde fan like I am this may be a little disappointing. I was hoping for some new facts, or even history but the story is really about the decommissioning of the Concorde and handing over G-BOAD to the intrepid museum. It's worth a look but nothing mind blowing.",1361404800,,287,4.333333333333333
8076972,3,B000AABL8K,"Concorde Alpha-Delta - An Intrepid Journey tells the story of Concorde, the first and still the only commercial aircraft to break the sound barrier with people onboard going from one city to another. However, the film has a curious way of telling the story of Concorde. Instead of going chronologically through time or having the end and then a comprehensive, orderly flashback through time, the film jumps back and forth sporadically over a great many years. The movie only runs a mere 44 minutes; and therefore the story must be presented rather fast--so what did they do? They start at the end with a Concorde aircraft, stripped of its four engines, being readied for its final journey on a barge to be permanently displayed at The USS Intrepid Seam Air & Space Museum at New York's waterfront; and then they go back and forth willy-nilly trying to tell you that Concorde was about the great dreams of humanity and a testament to the ability of mankind to create such a wonderful airplane. The filmmakers made sure to have female choirs singing in the background; this creates a very high intensity melodramatic punch that feels campy rather than respectful of Concorde. Worse yet, with all that we get of those smirking executives being interviewed for this film I can't really believe their claims that Concorde was about achieving the great dreams of mankind the way they say it was; Concorde, as we do learn, was much more the result of a business alliance between Britain and France to make supersonic airplanes and offer this mode of transportation to people for profit. And Concorde would have made a solid profit, too, if it were not for the 1973 Arab-Israeli War which, according to this film, resulted in Arabic oil producing countries quadrupling the price of oil practically overnight. Once the price of oil was so high, the plane had to be geared toward a much smaller, select group of very wealthy passengers. Indeed, British Airways and Air France were both lucky that there were enough businessmen whose companies were willing to pay for them to fly--there weren't even enough celebrities and royalty to keep the business afloat!

The DVD comes with three or four rather brief extras including an 18 minute version of this documentary and a brief featurette about the fastest trip Concorde made between New York and London.

I know, I know. It may seem as if I've given it all away I can assure you that I haven't. The video newsclips from the early days of Concorde aren't many but what we do get is very good. There is excellent footage from other people being interviewed--even the grandson of Charles Lindbergh has something interesting to say! Unfortunately, there is just too great an emphasis on the end of Concorde when one of them was stripped of its engines and sent on a barge to be displayed on the Intrepid in New York's harbor. Unless you're a diehard Concorde fan you would do well to look for other documentaries or retrospectives about this aircraft; there's not enough meat on the bone here and that's a shame. I expected much more from The History Channel.",1251763200,3,3094,4.792134831460674
8076973,3,B000AABL8K,"This DVD details, or should we say, ""glosses over"" the finer points of Concorde G-BOAD's retirement to the Intrepid Air and Space Museum, New York, one of the more controversial retirement locations.

As such, little is said about the negative points of the aircraft's location; neither sea air (and spray) nor the museum allowing people to walk on board with wet feet are going to enable the airframe to stay in good condition for very long.  The Intrepid's SR-71 (Blackbird) is known for being largely rust, carefully concealed under layers and layers of paint.  It's not the most picturesque location either.

Hopefully when the museum reopens in the autumn of 2008, they'll have built the glass hangar they promised for Concorde when the aircraft retired, but in the meantime the DVD is more of a PR exercise, in which the location is praised perhaps a little more than is necessary.

Worth mentioning is at the time of writing, Concorde G-BOAD is located at the Aviator Sports and Recreation area at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn.

...and one last note to our American friends, there is no ""the"" in Concorde, as in ""the Concorde"", it's just ""Concorde"" (there are more than one).",1187481600,3,1185,4.870646766169155
8076974,1,B000AABL8K,"This dvd almost does`nt say a thing about about building the concorde, it just tells you the story of the concordes last trip to new york, and then moving it to the intrepid. It really does not tell the history of the actuall concorde, try different dvd`s on this topic.",1185840000,5,270,4.42
8076975,4,B000AABL8K,"I purchased this hoping for a more in depth history of the Concorde but alas it is quite superficial and focuses more on the unit that ended up at the Intrepid museum in NYC.  For those interested in a focused history of the R&D  behind the Concorde I recommend a hard copy of ""Concorde"" by Frederic Beniada & Michel Fraile.  The photographs are fabulous making this more of a coffee table style text but the ultimate is for those with a good grasp of written French, Pierre Sparaco's ""Concorde, la veritable histoire"".",1183075200,6,519,4.619565217391305
