8490620,5,B0060Q8PLO,Thought this series was one of the most original concepts of it's time.  Nothing like it till this day.  Awesome to be able to relive it.,1421020800,,137,4.230769230769231
8490621,5,B0060Q8PLO,You want to know what i say if your going to buy this. Well you can buy them separate beings the 5 season was well a show that i can't believe that scifi would show. But there movies today suck. And season 4 was okay because Jerry o'connel played in them but. season 3 it started to go downhill when they killed the professor off the show. So if you want to you can buy them separate and you can keep season 5 has a paper weight.,1410998400,,429,3.942528735632184
8490622,3,B0060Q8PLO,"This series started off as one liberal perspective after another - green issues, anti-military, feminine rights, and so forth. It got better. The actors matured and many episodes were well written. But not all. I skipped some about zombies, youth cultures running the world, and such.  But, again, there were some good themes.  I rated the series 3-stars but there some that wouldn't rate that and maybe a third that I'd rate 4, and a couple that were excellent and rate a full 5 stars. Overall, I'm pleased with the value for the cost of the series.",1394496000,,550,4.65979381443299
8490623,3,B0060Q8PLO,"This series is a little too slapstick for my taste, although someone from the ages of 10-18 years old may enjoy it.",1369958400,2,115,4.2727272727272725
8490624,5,B0060Q8PLO,Why pay $120.00 for the series when you can buy them seperate for $60.00 total? Does`nt make sense to me......,1356307200,3,110,4.55
8490625,5,B0060Q8PLO,I find it real sad to hear this awsome piece of sifi wonder and excitement may no longer be available. How could this be I wonder?What a shame I think!!,1335398400,4,152,4.1
