1687479,2,B0000633TJ,"I must be one of Michael Colyar's biggest fans. He is the ultimate comedian. This show does not do justice to his immense talent and stage presence. Trust me, this guy is 100 times funnier than this show would suggest.",1159660800,,218,4.475
1687480,4,B0000633TJ,"I must agree with both of the comments made by these two!

I like Michael Colyar, I think he is but this DVD wasn't all that, in other comedy series he is very funny, his way of presenting comedy is out of this world, but in this dvd he wasn't really doing that if you know what i mean.

If you purchase this DVD you will have a laugh but the Michael Colyar edge of comedy style is missing or he didn't show enough of!",1153612800,,418,3.9058823529411764
1687481,4,B0000633TJ,"I thought Michael Colyar's DVD displayed Michael Colyar on another level.  He is truly the most versatile comedian, today! Michael's strategy is not only to make people laugh but enlightened while educating.  His ability to switch emotions and jump in and out of characters is beyond being creative.  He works comedy as a professionist.

1687482,1,B0000633TJ,"I saw Michael on a few other programs and he was hilarious, so I decided to check this DVD out.  First of all, it starts out showing the most ignorant black people on the planet.  Then, he goes on and on about how much money he has...after about 25 minutes I did not have one single laugh, I took out of DVD player.  Thank god I rented it from Blockbuster, if it had been good I would have purchased for my collection.  Maybe next time, cause this one was not funny at all.",1067817600,11,473,4.053763440860215
