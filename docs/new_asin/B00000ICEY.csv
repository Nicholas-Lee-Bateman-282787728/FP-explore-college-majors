1221237,5,B00000ICEY,This is a great series. Vegeta and Goku ROCK!! Gohan's survival training and the great fight between the Sayans is a must see. Vegeta-Sayan Style is one of the best. :-) Everyone MUST have this box set!! Vegeta Rules!!,926121600,,218,4.615384615384615
1221260,5,B00000ICEY,"As a kid back in 1996, this is the DBZ I grew up with. It may not look as awesome as the Dragon Box sets, the amount of editing is phenomenal, and the english voice acting is pretty bad most of the time. It just brings back to many awesome memories!

How can I forget that scene where Nappa shoots down up a helicopter and Tien shouts out: ""Look I can see their parachutes!! They're ok!"" in an attempt to tone down the violence of the show...

Or how when Vegeta and Nappa crash land and destroy a building; Vegeta says: ""Too bad it's Sunday, tomorrow those buildings would've been full.""

tsk tsk.

1221261,5,B00000ICEY,"ppl always spam how horrible this dub is but guess what. its the version that put dbz on the map in america. the voices and music are completely different from all the other versions. ida know, it has character. so what if funi has better sound effects, i could care less. this is exactly what i saw on cartoon network and loved every single minute of it. if you want some variety and don't listen to half the people who haven't even watched it!, then give this one version a shot.",1265414400,,481,4.2967032967032965
1221262,5,B00000ICEY,"I have to somewhat agree with what most people are saying about the unedited blah, blah, blah....grumble grumble, blah, blah, blah.  That said, most people seeing these now have to realize this show was edited and intended for kids when it was first released in the US, like the Transformers was in the 80's; it was toned down to reach a wider audience and television then hadn't begun to allow the incredible crassness most people are used to nowadays.  What needs to be appreciated here is the quality of voice talent and sound.  Though the all-around audio and special effects of the newer ""Funimation only"" (after the series lost it's Pioneer counterpart) eventually picked up, the voice acting remained terrible.  I mean, Sean Schemmel, who does the voice of Goku in the newer episodes after Pioneer stopped producing them, sounds monotonous when he talks and as if he's trying to have a bowel movement that he's pent up for a week when he does Goku's powering up.  None of the other new voice actors have much talent either.  Although I know this is all opinion, I must at least implore people reading this review to at least compare the voices and original music/sound on youtube if nothing else before they completely dismiss these older US versions of the show.

What I can't stand the most is the fact that Funimation went back and redubbed all the Saiyan Conflict and Namek Saga with all the new voices, and though they included much that was left out when Pioneer and Funimation were working together, they also destroyed the only good piece of US Dragonball Z that was left.  Meaning now...most people will never get to experience Brian Drummond's amazing Vegeta voice over along with any of the other original voice talents.  Instead they will get voices from people who sound like they took acting lessons from Ben Stein.

Alas, because Dragonball Z didn't pick up in the US until after Pioneer stopped producing it, people will have to venture to other anime series such as Gundam Wing to experience a lot of the lost talent. Scott McNeil (Duo, Gundam Wing/Piccolo, Dragonball Z) and Brian Drummond (Zechs Marquise, Gundam Wing/Vegeta, Dragonball Z) just to name a couple.

Either way, I recommend just buying the new ""Seasons"" Funimation has been producing as of late for a reasonable price and watching the original Japanese versions with the English subtitles because, Pioneer or no Pioneer, these versions will always remain the best.",1230336000,7,2454,4.875
1221263,4,B00000ICEY,"Ok, ok, ok. Now, honestly, I don't think this saga is half bad! It has some great stories that are totally original and awesome! I especially like Goku traveling on Snake Way! Even though the voices are terrible and they edit all of the good stuff, this saga gets ragged on a lot more than it should. This set includes the 3 or 4 episode turned special of Radits, Goku traveling to Snake Way, Goku training with King Kai, and the Fights that break out between the Saiyans and the Z Gang. Even if you are a beginner and choose the Vegeta Saga over this, I would at least reccomend to give this a whirl.",1145145600,,601,4.234782608695652

1221265,3,B00000ICEY,"I watched most of the series and the last episode back then... some of the fight scenes are too long, and plain boring.  But don't get me wrong, quite hilarious and I laughed all the way through especially when Gohan engaged in a fight scene with Frieza.  Gohan and Goku are super saiyans and they have this special power...  Man... this is something!!!

You gotta see this one!",1135641600,,378,4.514705882352941
1221266,5,B00000ICEY,"The saiyan conflict is the beginning of the dragon ball Z saga which follows the original series Dragon Ball. Although it is the second series it is not necessary to watch the first series to get this one as some recap happens right away to let you know where things are. The story opens up with the original cast having a reunion after having been apart for a while. Goku's brother shows up at the reunion after flying in from outer space although Goku didn't even know that he had a brother. He finds out that he is actually an alien know as a Saiyan and that originally he was sent to earth as a baby (since earth is such a weak planet it would only require a saiyan baby) to eliminate all live on the planet so the planet could be sold. Raditz (Goku's brother) tells Goku he wants him to join him and to prove his loyalty he must eliminate 100 humans. Raditz takes goku's son to make sure the job gets done.

  The story moves on from there with lots of cool fight scenes and action. The initial episodes are slightly more like Dragon ball catering to a younger audience but it quickly moves on to good fight scenes and characters being sent to another dimension (Killed). The show is great and this series along with the following saga The Namek Saga, are amongst the best in the series and defiantly worth watching.",1118102400,2,1321,4.361788617886178
1221267,1,B00000ICEY,"I saw this first part to the brilliant series on UK tv.

1221268,2,B00000ICEY,"I can't believe what the english market has done to this awesome piece of art. They just didn't have enough changing the opening song but they had to include some weird music to the series and cut most of the more dramatic scenes. Translation is bad , even the voices that they gave to the characters don't fit with their personalities. The DBZ saga is still good but the thing that irritates me the most is that they replace the music for some rock kinna music that just tells u even more that ur not watching the real deal.",1110844800,3,525,4.313131313131313

They save Gohan but Goku dies. Piccolo takes the young saiyan (Gohan) to a desert wasteland for special training while Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Yajirobe train for the saiyans stronger than Radits!
 Goku travels the long rode of Snake Way in search of the martial arts master King Kai. After one year th saiyans finaly arrive. It seems that the saiyans are unstopable. Tien, Yamcha, and Chiaotzu are gone. Piccolo saves Gohan, but this sends him to another dimention as well. When all seems lost for Gohan and Krillin Goku comes back from King Kai's planet.

1221284,3,B00000ICEY,"I love this whole series so I'm hard-pressed to say anything negative about it...but. The Saiyan Conflict is the opening of DragonBall Z. This series really should have been offered uncut and included the original Japanese language versions. In some ways, the editing and the occasionally sappy (not to mention inaccurate) English translations change the characters' personalities and some of the finer (and not-so-fine) points of the story itself. OK, the violence of the uncut versions can be intense even for us elders (I'm a mom) but let's not miss the point, either. Some of the most important and emotional interactions were cut out. I had to fill in the gaps with fansubs and Japanese websites. I would have given a solid 5 stars to some of these episodes if they were uncut and the original was included as I would some of the Frieza DVD's and many others, but in this case the editing took an edgy, interesting story filled with diverse and complex characters and turned it into a somewhat bland little kid's cartoon. Overall, I wouldn't have missed it, though I would've saved the money and watched it on Cartoon Network. If the uncut version comes out with the original included, I'd buy it.",1066089600,10,1202,4.811594202898551
1221285,5,B00000ICEY,"It is the animation which is popular in Japan.
DORAGONBALLZ was the most popular@animation also in Japan.

I recommend especially this DVD.
This animation is the most interesting by the animation seen until now.

1221286,3,B00000ICEY,"This set is Ok.  The episodes are the same as the ones on Toonami, so you're not getting anything different.  The edited version of this show is Ok, but not nearly as good as the Japanese version.  The English version skiped some episodes (including the real first episode), made a lot of edits (mainly with blood), lots of cuts, and different music.  I personally don't think this is worth it.  This anime has been butchered to death and has seen better days.  Don't blame Funimation for this though, because without them, DBZ might not of even been brought to the states.  If you want the Japanese version, you have two options.  Either wait for Funimation to release the Japanese box sets, or go [elsewhere]  and get them.  They're not by Funi, but it's the uncut, unedited version of DBZ.  The first box set has the first 25 episodes (like this) and [cheap], less than half of the price of this.  If you really want to see the English version of this, just watch Toonami.  Don't get this, because you have a lot of better things to blow your money on.",1059091200,5,1055,4.489473684210527
1221287,4,B00000ICEY,...and it would be great if not for all the editing. Though its still good and worth buying if you like DBZ. This boxed set and series is great cause you are always left with a cliffhanger and wanting more. Plus there is tons of great fighting action and a little bit of humor. This set has you waiting a while but towards the end the action gets heavy and the wait pays off. Buy this set today if you like Dragonball Z.,1050278400,,420,4.072289156626506
1221288,1,B00000ICEY,"I really wonder why people still think that PIONEER EDITED THE SERIES! lol
First of all, the edits where made directed SABAN (think POWER RANGERS) when FUNimation was still young.  Pioneer just did the distribution...no wonder you see the Pioneer logo on these discs.
Don't get me wrong.""Steve: Moving to the series itself, let's talk about the first two seasons. For starters, why were they censored to such an extreme degree?
Gen: That was a requirement of our distributer, Saban. We had a lot of arguments with them, saying they were going way to far with the censorship, but they would refuse to air it unless it was cut to their liking. In fact, I recall one show that we censored a little less than usual, and they just refused to air it. ""
Gen is the CEO of FUNimation.
So sorry, heh.
In addition, if you want REAL PIONEER DBZ DUBS, check out Movies 1-3.  They were produced by Pioneer in assoc. with FUNimation.  Although the have some flaws, they're good and have accurate scripts plus original music.
As for the TOEI discs, they are digitally remastered and may include full episodes unlike the FUNi discs which has left out some parts (eyecatchers, previews...) in the past.  They may also be in progressive encoding, which is superior to FUNimation's interlaced which is found on many (if not all) of their discs.
If anyone wants to add something, go ahead.",1042416000,4,1369,4.691666666666666
1221289,1,B00000ICEY,"INTRO:  To put it simply, I do not know why this is still being sold.  This DVD set was released by Pioneer when they originally had the rights to DBZ.  They edited the series so bad that its down below an average kid's level of watching.  This DVD set contains English-only episodes without the original Japanese audio tracks, so don't bother with it if you are a Dragon Ball Z otaku.  Normally I would go into detail about the DVDs but why bother in this case?
SUGGESTION:  Toei in Japan is planning on releasing the original Dragon Ball Z episodes on DVD in mid 2003 and will be in two complete DVD box sets.  Each box set will contain 26 discs and split the series in half.  Whether or not they will have english at all on the dvds is too far to tell right now.  Each box set will cost a whopping 850$ though, so it might turn off some buyers.  My suggestion if you're not willing to shell out 1000$+ for DBZ on DVD at once, just buy the US DVDs, they have unedited versions of the original Japanese episodes as well as the new English version.  Also, FUNimation (the new holder of DBZ in america), has obtained the rights to do the first saga of DBZ over and uncut (fixing what Pioneer did).  So hopefully this little suggestion essay wasn't too confusing.  Well, good luck!",1036713600,18,1279,4.323529411764706
1221290,5,B00000ICEY,DBZ is one of the greatest animes for one reason...complexity.  The storyline in this series is the best I have ever heard of.  The first DBZ saga is where Goku learns about his alien heritage.  His son Gohan(which is Japanese for rice) is captured buy Saiyans(an alien race fixed n ruling the earth).  The problem is Goku is a Saiyan also.  The animation is top notch!  I would reccomend this more than the manga because the artwork in the manga stinks.  I think that the orginal Dragon Ball was better though...,1031961600,,513,4.571428571428571

I was disappointed to learn you don't get to see the final fight between Goku and Vegeta.  After all, that's what the whole story is leading up to.  You will need to buy the Departure CD (1st CD in the Namek Saga boxed set) to see the final battle between Goku and Vegeta.

1221311,5,B00000ICEY,"Dragon Ball Z is a milestone in animation:
to call it a cartoon is an insult.
Cartoon characters never grow old, they never die,
and their lives never change.
Not so with DBZ.
Watching the characters develop,
adapt and overcome is a very big part of DBZ's appeal.
And they grow older too.
All while maintaining an unbelievably fierce loyalty and love for each other that makes you hard pressed to believe that you're watching a cartoon show.
Basically, you have a front row seat to each one of their lives, something not quite done in any animated series before.
And there are so many different characters and personality types that this show is a literal smorgasbord of personality, and sometimes it's funny as hell, and other times, downright serious, and very grim.
Here is a very even and intelligent mix of martial arts, science fiction, and humor that is infectious to the limits. You can't just watch one episode, you have to see them all.
And the battles are just as unbelievable as the hairstyles of Goku and Vegeta, the two main characters who represent the last of their once proud warrior race, the Saiyans.
The almost soap opera-like quality of the series is another main appeal, and you feel as if you are gettting INTO the lives of the characters, and it just gets better and better with every viewing.
In animation, trends may come and go, but DBZ is very special and stands alone in it's own field as a remarkable journey down the road of life, with many a stop in to the unknown along the way, and it's one hell of a ride that leaves you gasping for more.",1003968000,,1573,4.542253521126761

The writing on this show is fantastic.  Terrific storylines, unique characters, awesome powers.  After each tape ended I just popped in the next one.  This is something you'll watch over and over again.  It's kind of like pro wrestling, although you watch it and know what happens, you go back later and watch it again, and again, and again.
I've read other reviews of this and other DBZ videos, and people whine and complain that they're edited.  Now, if that's all you care about, then that's sad.  If all you care about is violence and profanity, and you don't buy this set (or any other DBZ video) because it's ""edited"", then that's REAL sad.

So all of the Z warriors train for them. When they arrive on earth the action starts. The fight with Nappa, Piccolo, and Krillen is great.

That was my appreciation as a fan.  Now I see every little kid wearing thier DBZ shirts from millers outpost,  and watching the show on TV. I caught a glimspe of it at a friend's house,  and boy was the plot crap! Instead of killing thier enemies, they  ""send them to another dimension""? What the hell? And the dubbing  was oh so horrible. I just wanted to bash the TV set with a crowbar.
The  point of all this is that I hate DBZ, and unless you were a fan of it from  the late 80's thru the early 90's, you're just another newbie contributing  to the deterioration of the anime genre.
Now they are going to ruin  Gundam, Kenshin and Escaflowne...
I just wish they stop this and just  keep showing thier spiderman and superman cartoons, since the new  generation of the DBZ audience does not really appreciate the creators of  the show as well as other shows.",968889600,4,1272,4.348936170212766
1221343,5,B00000ICEY,"I saw this set on cartoon network and instantly fell in love with it. The animation is incredible compared to the cartoons made in america and the  story lines are more interesting. The characters are easily relatable, but  fantastic at the same time. There really is no comparison to any other show  or movie out there. It also is something that is interesting enough for  adults, but not to boring for children. I intend to buy the entire sets of  dragonball and dragonballz. Then when the newer dragonball gt comes out I'll  buy it, too. My recomendation buy it while you can.",967680000,,579,4.627450980392157
1221344,1,B00000ICEY,"I know, I know, most think this is the best. I however like animes like Ruroni Kenshin, Magic Knight Rayearth, Tenchi Muyo!, and Vision of  Escaflowne. I quickly got bored with this series. I quickly got bored with  the characters and the animation was cool at first but now I think it is  kind of lame. What gets me the most mad is the bad guys. They don't die!  They just become stronger in one LONG battle. Freeza's battle was so  boring. The action is so mindless and nothing happens in action but  annoying grunts. The plot is okay. Save all the Dragonballs... Not too  great but not bad I guess. There is more to the plot at times but pretty  much all the bad guys want all the Dragonballs. If you need a anime filled  with action you can get this I guess... But the action is bad I think. If  your into Shojo anime pass this one!",965088000,2,836,4.20125786163522
1221345,5,B00000ICEY,"I have to say first that, like many things, my friend reccomended this to  me and I was extremely skeptical. ""I don't know...Isn't DBZ for little  kids?"" I questioned. Finally I watched it, got the hang of it, and was  glued to the screen. I loved the Saiyan Saga. For a cartoon, it's quite  well done. At first what may seem like cheesy dialogue leads into superb,  gripping action followed by dramatic emotional scenes which aid in  character development. While I noticed they refer to death as ""moving  to the next dimension"". This does not detract from the experience, but  simply gives you a different way of looking at death. The good guys are  heroic yet human, making it easy to relate to their inner turmoil. But the  bad guys blew me away. When you hate them, that's the sign of a good film  When you actually can find yourself able to see from their perspective and  realize why they commit their evil deeds, that's the sign of a godly film.  A stependous mixture of action and drama and humor, this set is a perfect  addition to anyone's collection--not just anime lovers.",961372800,10,1084,4.578125
1221346,5,B00000ICEY,"To put it simply, in order to understand later episodes of the DBZ saga, you must know what happens at the begining.  DBZ follows in the proud footsteps of other Anime dramas and then rises to the next level with heros  that you root for and villians you want to reach out an choke.  This set is  the foundation for a story which rocks the free world (sorry china), and is  a must buy.",960163200,3,385,4.148648648648648
1221347,5,B00000ICEY,"This box set is the best. It contains the first 25 episodes, which is a lot more than it sounds like. So much can happen in 25 episodes. I wish it would end with the defeat of Vegeta instead of just showing the spirit bomb  hitting him. Oh well im buyin 2 either way. One problem is the fact that  they say people were sent to another dimension, when in Japanese theyve  died. And they say that a city was evacuated, when literally seconds before  there were dozens of people around. There are lots of references like this.  But just ignore it and youll be fine.",954806400,2,562,4.264150943396227
1221348,5,B00000ICEY,"Dragonball Z is an entertaining action ride that is aimed at children, but is very funny and entertaining for adults too.  It tells a saga, rather than being a collection of unrelated episodes.  As such, we get to see the  characters develop and grow.  Each adventure or event impacts the rest of  the series, rather than simply being forgotten.  For children, it should be  noted that the series has some violence in it.  There is a great deal of  fighting and characters do die, which brings me to my next point.  In  translating the series for American television, a great deal of effort has  been made to remove all references to death.  While this may be fine for  the kids, who may not realize what is going on, for adults watching the  series, it is almost painful to listen to them talk about the dead people  having been ""sent to another dimension"" or the crowded city as  having been evacuated before being blown up.  It is best just to ignore  these references and enjoy the story as it was meant to be told.",951696000,5,1019,4.469945355191257

It picks up where Dragonball left off, with a reunion of the characters that is interrupted by Raditz, Goku's long lost bro.  We learn Goku and Piccolo are  aliens, Goku dies in the fight with Raditz, stays dead for 1 year, gets  really strong, and comes back to fight Nappa and Vegeta, that's where the  action really kicks in.  A hint: not everyone lives due to the fact that  Goku arrives late.  This review is brief, and there's a lot more to it than  this.  Get this set, or get cable.",949795200,7,552,4.376237623762377

1221367,5,B00000ICEY,"Dragon Ball Z is highly one of the most amazing shows I've EVER seen! I came accross it one lazy Saturday morning on fox, and I was jumping for joy when it was put on Cartoon Network... but, anyway, this boxset has to be  some of my favorite episodes ever. I *love* the parts about Saiyans!! Goku  is my favorite, then Vegeta, then Gohan. Raditz, well.. he's actually cool,  but annoying somewhat, why, bringing destruction on Earth... not if Son  Goku can help it!! And believe me.. ~ he can ~.. This box set contains one  of my ~* ALL TIME FAVORITE BATTLE*~ < drum roll > The showdown  between Vegeta and Goku!!! I LUV that! In conclusion, though, Dragon Ball Z  is the the very best action/drama/humerous cartoon or manga I could ever  see, and I hope you take the time to see it!! You'll love it too!!",940032000,28,805,4.355704697986577
1221386,5,B00000ICEY,"This set was so cool. I found out a lot of stuff about DBZ that I didn't know. It was awesome to see how Goku trained and how Gohan got to be such an awesome fighter. I loved that scene where Gohan booted Nappa right in  the face. He's pretty strong for a six year old kid. I also loved the part  where Goku used the ""Triple Kaio-Ken attack"" and completely  throttle's Vegeta.  I really enjoyed the videos, I highly recommend  them to any DBZ fan. Especially if you like to collect the episodes. Oh by  the way, there are 18 brand new episodes of DBZ airing on Cartoon Network  beginning on September 6th, and the videos should be available in June,  just in case you haven't heard already.",936057600,,690,4.294573643410852

It is very powerful, emotional, and graphical.  I wouldn't reccommend it  for young kids, but on the other hand I got into it at the age of 3.  I  lived in Japan where they had no cuts of the tape.  But this is still a  very very awesome series and you should get it if you want to learn about  DragonBall Z or if your an all time fan.",932169600,,483,3.9072164948453607

7910242,4,B00000ICEY,"The main enjoyment factor in this box set for mostly anyone over the age of 10 would be nostalgia. That statement is not entirely directed at Dragon Ball Z in general, but rather the dub on these English box sets. You may remember the funky episodes of DBZ (pre-Friez saga) where everyone had different voices and the dialogue was laughable, often a bland description of what the character was doing or how what they were doing made them feel, or even more common, a poorly crafted insult that really could have done well not being there. I have no on-hand examples, but a reminiscent example might be ""We have to take out this pea-brained numbskull! Quick!, Let's attack!"".

If nostalgia does have a heavy hand in bringing you to this page, however, then I say go for it. At the very least it's noise in the background; sailing on a nostalgic stream of cheese.",1424822400,,861,4.590909090909091

Yeah the fact that its cut/edited kinda sucks but I also own all of the Uncut so that doesn't bother me at all. I just wanted this for the original voice actors and music version that I grew up with. I wish they would have kept these voice actors and music for the uncut versions then I wouldn't have even needed to get this.

If you loved DragonBall Z in the 90's and your an Original fan like I am, then this set is a great one for you. If you prefer to see the show how it was meant to be and or aired in Japan then by all means buy the uncut versions of this series.",1327190400,,770,3.8364779874213837
