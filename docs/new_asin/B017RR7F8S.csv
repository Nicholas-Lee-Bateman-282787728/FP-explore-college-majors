7516199,2,B017RR7F8S,"Ever get the feeling someone is watching you?  That's the premise behind this movie: beautiful girl gets stalked, which allows the audience to become voyeurs through the eyes of the stalker. I do not know if you need to be a fan of Ms. Benson who plays Emma, the damsel in distress to sit through this much of a anticlimatic movie. I felt cheated in the end when Emma is video chatting with her mother.  I will not spoil the ending but let's just say there's for the most part more screaming and little action.",1457222400,,510,4.3578947368421055

7516201,5,B017RR7F8S,"This was amazing. Although it leaves you with so many unanswered questions, the overall premise of the movie was incredible. It had enough suspense that it was terrifying. Not many movies can leave things unanswered and have you still love the movie. I would definitely recommend this for horror movie lovers, something to watch with your lover, or to watch with a group of friends. I watched alone and am terrified! The unknown in this movie is what adds to the overall suspense and fear. It stays true to some stalking cases. Some times the victim never knows their stalker and is stalked for a while without knowing or never find out for years on end until something happens. It reminds me of a show on Investigate Discovery called Stalked where people tell their stories of them being stalked and this is very similar to how they were stalked. They never knew there stalker but there stalker acquired info about them and their family. One woman never even found out who her stalker was after years in fear he just stopped then picked up again years later. She never found out who or why. Then finally when they discovered the stalker he took his life days later before anyone could find out who he was or why he did it. So this is why I find this movie to be so intriguing. It takes technology and makes a very believable story and doesn't follow the concept of an average movie story line. I've never seen another movie approach it this way. Well done.",1457136000,2,1457,4.5437262357414445
7516202,1,B017RR7F8S,"Seventy minutes (yes, the film clocks in at barely over an hour) of an uninteresting person's uninteresting life (we see her dance alone  in her apartment three times, for goodness sake) is cyber-stalked by someone who apparently finds her dull life fascinating or titillating or something. This subject has already been handled by the far superior films ""The Den,"" ""Open Windows"" and ""Alone With Her."" If this subject interests you, do yourself a favor and watch one or more of those films instead of this snoozefest that is basically a Lifetime movie with a few F bombs thrown in.",1456963200,5,582,4.878787878787879

7516204,2,B017RR7F8S,"I wouldn't totally hate on this movie because some of it was entertaining,  but I do admit I was highly let down when I realized it was ending. It felt like my time was wasted. There was so many questions that remained and not one was answered. Did Emma survive the attack? What happened to Michael?  Who was the ""stalker""? Not one of these were answered! Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and I definitely wouldn't watch it again.

I am a big Ashley Benson, and Pretty Little Liars fan, so I guess that was another reason I was so disappointed.",1456876800,,564,4.456310679611651
7516205,2,B017RR7F8S,"Emma (Ashley Benson) leaves the Midwest and her ex-boyfriend Alex (Michael William Freeman) to be an economic student in NYC. She meets Michael (Matt McGorry) and they hit it off. It is made clear that Emma is being watched or stalked from her electronic equipment. The stalker becomes braver as the film progresses.

Voyeur films have progressed from the creep looking like Crispin Glover who drills holes in the wall. The quality of these devices were excellent and most likely not really used in making the film. I have to question the real motives of the stalker as we get film of Emma dancing, an inside the tote view, her sleeping, and bathroom close ups of her shaving her ankle. In one scene where she pleasures herself, we get a close up of her face. In a film that spies 100% of the time on a young girl who looks like Susan Dey lite, there is no nudity. What is worse is the ending which not only failed to bring everything together ( by design) it was PLOT SPOILER basically a dark scene. And by dark I don't mean evil or sinister, I mean not well lit. It was pretty much a waste of time.

The trailer enticed me, and the few chilling moments kept me wondering who was behind it all. I am still confused as to what  point of view I was seeing this all from. Did Emma keep her phone and computer filming her every move? Was it the ""mystery person"" who planted all these devices that film every move? I mean even the two different angles of her peeing.... a bit much. Any way, I suppose, even as dramatic as it was, I understand the point being made.....I think. We spend entirely too much time documenting our every move, to the point of being oblivious to a dangerous person joining our extremely personal space.

7516235,1,B017RR7F8S,"I love Ashley Benson & that is the only reason why I decided to watch this movie. The premise was quite intriguing but thereafter, the movie made no sense whatsoever! Plot was totally lost - it was like they were dragging on the movie (with unnecessary scenes and dialog) just to make it plausible for screening. What was frustrating, was the fact that the movie was filmed as a third person and there were lots of glitches that made me yell ""mother buffer!!!""...

***Spoiler Alert***

Emma recently ""broke up"" with her boyfriend, Alex (who we have no idea on how he looks) and moved to a new city. She is your usual post teen - addicted to her cellphone, laptop, gaming, etc. She keeps in touch with her parents online - we also don't know what they look like!

Emma is oblivious to the fact that she is being stalked - the only legible glimpse we have of the stalker is when Emma is asleep and we see the pictures (on her laptop) move on her glasses lens - then we see a face being zoomed in. Apart from that, we have no clue (not even a subtle one) on who the stalker might be - we see blue eyes (and that was it!!). I tried looking into the eyes of every male that she encounters thereafter - no one with blue eyes.

Emma meets Michael (late one night at the campus library) and they immediately click. Emma is not ready for a steady relationship because of her break up with Alex. The weird part for me was when Michael and Emma were at the coffee shop, Emma left the table and we see Michael do something with his phone and something happens on Emma's phone... Was he the stalker .... arrggghhh!!!

Much more happened but it was far too boring and tedious for me to remember and bother to go into great detail!!! My level of frustration on the uncertainty and nonsensical scenes of this movie, rocketed to the sky!

Eventually, the stalker gains entry into Emma's apartment and she figures out that something is happening - she is busy on an online chat with her mother, when someone forcefully enters (not sure if it was the stalker or someone else) and her mother is screaming for him to leave Emma alone. The mother dials 911. Oh did I mention that her mother did not know her address - she was literally screaming her lungs out at the 911 Agent but for the life of her, she couldn't remember where her daughter lived - you know in a new city with several strangers - NOT A GOOD MOTHER AT ALL!!!

7516281,5,B017RR7F8S,"The moment I saw Ratter on Amazon for sale, it drew me in. Rarely do I look at the horror movies they recommend for me as I own all or most of them anyway. But I love Cyber Horror. All you need is a computer and a phone and you too can be the victim (or the villain). Ratter is one of those rare horror films that actually scared me.

Unfriended didn't scare me, while I love that film, the idea of a vengeful ghost killing kids on Skype wasn't nearly as scary. Ratter CAN happen. Ratter DOES happen. They could have slapped Based on a True Story and I wouldn't have doubted them. My only problem with Ratter was that it was too realistic. The acting wasn't great but it wasn't poor. It was like how people are in real life. The film plays itself as if you are watching what the Ratter is watching.

I don't normally feel for the victims, most of the time, I'm on the villains side. But I felt so scared, so frustrated, so wanting to help Emma, to warn Emma. Emma and myself probably wouldn't be friends, but man, did I feel the need to warn her of what was happening. I felt violated for her. I lost trust of those she trusted.

7516305,4,B017RR7F8S,"After moving to New York City from Wisconsin, Emma hopes to start life over. Not only on her own, but also away from her crazy ex-boyfriend. Everything is going great, shes enjoying her classes, loving her new apartment, making new friends, and a new guy in her life. Its only when she starts receiving weird messages in the mail and on her computer, as well as strange phone calls, she learns she may have a stalker. It turns out that she has been hacked and the hacker is now watching her every move due to an unknowing RAT (Random Access Trojan) download. He now has access to any gadget of her connected to her computer.

Films taking place in the cyber world is slowly becoming a new thing, including voyeurism horror. Some of them work, and some of them dont. The Den had some good suspense in it, but didn't capture the cyber aspects well. Unfriended wasn't scary or suspenseful at all, but nailed the cyber world. Its very hard to find common ground, but even harder for these films to capture some realism in general. Ratter is a low budget horror film that works well enough with the gadgets it has, but more than anything it takes a very common and plausible scenario and brings it to life in a terrifying way. At first glance it looks like its a found footage film. This isn't the case at all. Yes, its all through means of electronics, but we are actually seeing the events unfold from the very beginning through the screen of the stalker. We never once in the film get to be with Emma, which makes it even more disturbing to know that this whole time we are merely following Emma like the hacker/stalker is. The use of these gadgets and the point of views aren't as silly as some because it actually works. The most interesting ones comes from the point of view of Emmas cellphone. This knowledge is creepy enough of how we are viewing the film, but what makes it twice as horrific is the fact that this is a real thing and could happen to anyone. The events start out small, and gradually become more threatening. It all leads to an ending that is extremely horrific and a punch in the gut. It very much stuck with me for quite some time after it was over, not just the ending but the paranoia of the subject matter it deals with.

I may end up being the only one to say this after seeing it, but I honestly found it the scariest movie Ive seen in my adult life. This easily due to what I mentioned above about the fact that this kind of thing could really happen, and its only made me more paranoid about what I do with my electronics. The disturbing ending only added to it. Some may not be satisfied with the ending but its a situation where the unknown only makes it scarier. Despite this, I will say its not a perfect film. Despite being only an hour and twenty minutes, there are moments where it feels much longer and I found myself wanting it to move along quicker once things were clearly already established. This doesnt include the scenes where we get to know Emma as person and see her relationships develop with the new people in her life and see the relationships from her past. Ashley Benson is solid in the main role, she plays Emma with a great likability and you feel genuinely sorry and fear for her when her life becomes in turmoil. She also emits the emotions of fear and paranoia flawlessly. There isn't a moment of over-exaggeration or over-the-top acting. It feels very real. Matt McGorry also provides a nice performance as Emmas new love interest. McGorry brings in great charm and comes off as a real and sincere character and the two actors have very strong chemistry. Overall, the performances in the film are solid, even the who actors who we only hear the voices of do a fine job.

Ratter will be a film that I think most will probably not enjoy or think about as much I did. Let alone consider it a truly terrifying movie. Maybe Im overthinking it, or maybe I just saw something deep within it to make me feel that way. Either way, I do genuinely feel that this film brings something fresh and more suspenseful to the cyber-horror genre than most recent films.

7516308,2,B017RR7F8S,"This wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it wasn't the best either. If you don't mind repetitiveness and shaky camera flips and views, you might like this one. After watching the trailer, I thought it looked like a very interesting movie with promise. Even more so when the lead is Ashley Benson (Pretty Little Liars) who is accompanied by Matt McGorry (How To Get Away With Murder). Both are talented but you don't really get to see that in this movie.

The premise was interesting, it was something that a lot of people might be terrified for. Because of that, I really thought that this movie could be good. I hoped it wasn't all the flipping views with shaky bits and awkward pauses like in the trailer but sadly, it was. That took away from the story a bit for me. While it was needed for certain parts, I wish it wasn't like that for the entire movie.

Despite how much promise this looked like it had, I feel it fell kind of short for several reasons.
- Lack of backstory. We really knew nothing about Emma Taylor (Benson) and what had gone on in her past. We knew she had parents and an angry ex, that was pretty much it.
- No Character Development. This ties into the above, when you don't have a backstory, you can't develop characters as easily. Even with good actors and actresses, there is only so much you can do.
- Boring. Yeah, I said it, parts of this movie were boring. How many times do you want to watch someone shave part of their leg and play the same game in an hours time?

The only reason I am giving this two stars is the concept was there, it just needed more substance and time. It was rather short and I feel that really hurt this particular film.",1459036800,,1682,4.299684542586751
7516309,1,B017RR7F8S,"Low budget, overacted, nothing to offer mockumentary. No plot, storyline is mundane and flat, ending seen and done before too many times by other low budget look-alikes.",1458950400,,169,5.296296296296297
7516310,1,B017RR7F8S,"I was in the mood for a good stalker movie unfortunately, this was not it. Usually I'm a big fan of movies like this but nothing really happens. The plot sounds good enough... girl moves to city, someone hacks into her devices and turns on the cameras and watches her. Then for the next hour and fifteen minutes we watch her shave her legs, play games, talks on the phone, and nothing really scary happens. Last five minutes something happens but that isn't even good.

This hour and twenty minutes of the movie seemed to take forever, that's how boring it was. I couldn't even pay attention to it at all. I will say that the trailer was way better than the movie. Save your time and skip this movie.",1458950400,8,700,4.384615384615385
7516341,5,B017RR7F8S,I liked it. There was tension as well as dread. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Very underrated movie that is worth a watch in my opinion.,1458864000,,141,3.7333333333333334

7516346,2,B017RR7F8S,"Watched this because I heard it was bad. Unfortunately, not so bad as to be good. Ratter is kind of a reverse&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unfriended/dp/B010C2L4VE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unfriended</a>&nbsp;in that you are looking at Ashley Benson through the eyes of Unfriended's Laura Barnes (if Laura were a creepy dude).

You'll probably not like Ratter unless you:
 are a peeping Tom or/and
 enjoyed Unfriended or/and
 are obsessed with Ashley Benson

You probably shouldn't watch Ratter if you:
 hated Unfriended or/and
 are a girl / woman who's ever been stalked or/and
 are most people

I actually didn't know who Ashley Benson was, so I looked her up on IMDb and discovered, ""She has been dancing competitively since she was 2."" Big deal, I've been dancing competitively since I was 6 months old: I was so good, I made all the other infants cry. Seriously though, IMDb tells me I already saw Ashley in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pixels/dp/B012HPOA6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pixels</a>; dumbfounding it is to realize she's the same person who played Lady Lisa. Anyway, if Ratter's crummy, it's not because of her.

I *like* unconventional films shot in a way that thinks outside the box, and for the first half of Ratter I was into the unusualness. However, this screenwriter painted himself into a corner, showing us how his creativity is limited to the manner in which the narrative is told and not the actual narrative.

** Spoiler alert ** The ending is a cop out, and while we never find out exactly what happens, we can guess Ashley didn't end up sitting down with her stalker for cocktails. Sadly, the ending is a little bit too true to life.",1458000000,,1758,5.474074074074074

The whole movie I was questioning who the creeper was and excited for the movie to reach the climax. Well, the climax ended up being the end. There was NO SOLUTION.  Have the writers never heard of a PLOT? Well, after a climax, there is then the Falling Action, and then the RESOLUTION. The writers were too lazy to come up with an ending that actually shows who the guy was and why he wanted to take her. Even if he was a nobody and wanted to take her just because he has psychological issues, they could have written that at the end. Thus, emphasizing that anyone can be watching you and you could be a nobody. But no, they chose to have a big brain fart for the end, from which they could not recover. I'm going to now watch something else to cleanse my mind.",1457740800,10,898,4.377245508982036

For example, I really enjoyed The Ring and The Blair Witch Project for the suspenseful creepiness without any real gore. This was a really fun realistic scary movie!  The overall premise of the movie was incredibly realistic as well as the acting.  Plus, I never thought the ending was unfinished from process of elimination it's pretty simple to figure out...  overall the ending was a smart ending.  I would definitely recommend this for classic scary movie lovers!!!",1457740800,3,631,4.961904761904762

GREAT movie unless you are expecting any sort of an ending to it.  major let down, one of those, im gonna write a script but im not inspired/interested/talented enough to actually follow thru and write an ending so im just gonna pretty much black screen it and you can make up the ending yourself.  Hate that, if I pay for a movie I want to see the WHOLE movie not just what would have been quite a good movie with a really crappy ending",1457654400,2,476,4.1521739130434785
