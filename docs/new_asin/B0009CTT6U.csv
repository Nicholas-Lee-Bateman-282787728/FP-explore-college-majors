2276795,5,B0009CTT6U,"My son Joseph (4) loves this film and watches it over and over.  He has a very good knack for knowing which films have a high level of quality for children.  He will easily walk away from a film and go play with his toys, if it does not grab him and keep his interest.  This film has it all for children.  Not only is it entertaining, but contains several questions in logic that are patiently explained and answered by illustration; that is a real rarity in children's films today.  Included in my Best 2000 films of All Time Book for 2017; and that's not easy to do, either.",1465516800,,576,4.247706422018348

2276954,5,B0009CTT6U,"My two-year old son seems to prefer this older (2005) Thomas movie to the newer, CGI movies in our Netflix queue. It could be because we also have the paperback book that tells this story, and we read it frequently together. I would think he'd be more interested in the more modern, cartoony Thomas episodes, but this movie holds his full attention for the full hour. And he's seen it countless times!

The movie begins with Sir Topham Hatt coming to tell the engines that the Sodor Airport will begin construction soon, and he needs them all to help. A storm then blows over the island, causing damage. Sir Topham Hatt returns and tells them he needs their help more than ever if the airport is to open on time for tourist season. But the diesels and the steamies have a hard time working together, and spend more time biffing and bashing into one another. Thomas has a dream one night where Lady and Rusty work side by side in the quarry, Lady commenting that they always finish their jobs when they work together. Thomas and Mavis get all the engines together to urge everyone to put aside their differences and work together. Even Diesel 10, who is known for being difficult to work with, shows up to help. The airport is finished on time, and the engines and Sir Topham Hatt are all proud of the work done.",1413504000,,1311,4.485355648535565

This movie along with ""Hero of the Rails"" and ""Day of the Diesels"" are the best of the Thomas movies and ones that every child should love. These are my 2 year old son's favorites and he re-enacts them with his trains frequently.

2277041,3,B0009CTT6U,"It is so annoying to have to stand there for 5 minutes to make the DVD player skip all those adverts. It is somehow crazy, considering having paid for the DVD. I would pay more for one coming without adverts! Please anyone listen and offer them!
The story describes the prejudice and conflicts between diesels and steamies, tricks they play on each other until the situation is completely messed up and they have to work together to still reach the common objective of building an airport and being useful machines. As such I think that it reflects what happens in real life, which is good as a learning experience. For my liking, there could be less emphasis on the conflict and also some other content. Our young toddler loves the DVD (possibly because it is the only train-featuring DVD we have?) and sometimes needs some adult assistance with 'digesting' destructive events and behaviour displayed in the story.",1317859200,,915,4.834394904458598
2277042,3,B0009CTT6U,"I realize I'm one of the very few parents to mention the awful messages children can take away from this video. Yes, yes.. my son LOVES this movie so that in itself is redeeming. But come on, these trains are vicious! At the beginning the narrator states ""Can you see what's different about steamies and diesels?"" Then he goes on to explain the differences between the the ""stinky"" steamies and ""dirty"" diesels, while they are seen glaring at one another. This create a very 'us and them' mentality which carries on throughout the entire film. The disgruntled engines resort to name calling, sabotage each others cargo, and even get physical when they bang into one another. It looks like train racism to me...  =0

On a lighter note, the music is catchy and there are lots of great characters, including the the frightening and awe-inspiring Diesel 10. There are also educational aspects to the video, and lots of train jargon for my young enthusiast.",1315526400,,952,4.798780487804878
2277043,1,B0009CTT6U,"It's unfortunate that the script and its delivery don't match the nice visual touches in this episode.

2277056,1,B0009CTT6U,"We were so excited to get this DVD because my 2 year old grandson loves his little rubber Thomas the Train  engine.  We started to view the first segment and were disappointed in the quality of the animation first of all, but then came the question to the viewer (most likely impressionable children) ""Can you think of a way that Thomas can trick the diesel engines because he doesn't like them?""  WOW! and it gets worse from there.  Then further in the movie we expected that there would be some kind of reprimand or lesson about how bad it was for Thomas to do such a thing, but guess what -- that never occurred.  We promptly removed the DVD from the player and threw it away.  It would have been nice to know that this DVD contained questionable content inappropriate for young children. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.

Choo choo is his favorite word, his main enjoyment these days is everything train related and he LOVES this movie. He asks for it daily, and I allow him to watch 30 minutes every night and then I pretend TV is broken ;) Hey we moms do what we can!

For me, the DVD/movie is annoying for a number of reasons. I don't like that I can't access the movie immediately by pressing the menu key. This means you're forced to either watch or painstakingly skip through each advert for another movie - Barney, Bob the Builder etc.

It's been said before but I must echo that the voice-over the narrator does is awful. He doesn't stay in character beyond the first 3 words (if that). he has no excitement or emotion in his voice. I'm sure he's smoking a cigarette with his feet up, thinking about his paycheck while he's in the studio.

If your son/daughter adores trains and the Thomas series they will probably enjoy this series but I'm willing to bet all adults in the room will find something else to do when this is on. I gave it three stars for my son, and 0 for me.",1267488000,2,1153,4.255707762557078

2277085,2,B0009CTT6U,"Unlike many, my son and I actually did like Thomas and the Magic Railroad. Yes, there were definitely weaknesses with much of the acting, dialog, etc. but my 2yo son LOVES Diesel 10 and really enjoyed the horse and dog in the live action segments. I liked the songs and appreciated some of the puns. The pace kept moving w/o being frantic.
We also have the Complete Season 1 Set(British, Ringo Starr) and my son enjoys them. Gets all excited about the Choo-Choos! My husband and I really prefer those over more recent Seasons. We have a friend with some of the ""new Thomas"" DVDs and we found them inferior and so generally haven't bought them. I also can't stand the new theme song.

However, we went ahead and got ""Calling All Engines"" specifically because of the amount of Diesel content. However, my son won't even watch it. I find the interruptions for ""activities"" annoying- just have them as a DVD feature, not part of the main presentation. My son watches very little TV/Movies and I think he found the CGI animation stuff bizarre. I think he also was disappointed/confused by Diesel 10 having a different way of being/speaking from Magic Railroad. The change in voice actor isn't the issue- we often watch Magic Railroad in Spanish- more the way of speaking is like a total personality change. He didn't do anything but sit there throughout the majority of the movie. And then at the end when he finally spoke, he was sort of grumpy, not comically devilish. And I get that the whole point was Steamies and Diesels working together, but there was no process for Diesel 10 to get to that point. It's like he was simply neutered.
Anyway, my son as so excited for me to put this DVD on and then stopped watching within a few minutes. On sick/lazy days he will watch Magic Railroad or the Season 1 DVDs all the way through. I did let Calling All Engines play through while we did something else, and my son never went back over to it. I put it on another time and he danced to Busy, Busy, Busy and then was finished. I guess this will be a good movie to put on when my son is begging to watch a movie and I'd prefer for him to do something else. ;)
From now on we will just have to stick with Old School Thomas. I think I might have to invest in a Region Free DVD player so that I can watch the UK releases of the Complete Seasons from the early years.",1239062400,5,2355,4.364464692482915

Gone are the days when I could let my kids watch the shows without my having to view them first.  And in addition to having more questionable content (see below), the shows are much more twaddle than they used to be.  Older Thomas shows don't beat the kids over the head with the moral like these new ones seem to.  And the stories in the older Thomas shows just seemed better.

This particular escapade has dramatic tension, and a good message about working together to accomplish good things, but the engines now use expletives -- okay, not grown-up expletives, but things like ""Cinders and Ashes!""  which my children started using as expletives.  (They hadn't used expletives before, other than ""Bother!"")  The engines call each other names (""Stinky Steamies"" for example), and, again, my children started calling each other ""stinky"" for awhile.  We hadn't had name-calling problems before the movie.  Now, I realize that most kids are exposed to much worse, but I draw attention to this because the older Thomas episodes didn't have any of this going on.  Three-year olds could watch with impunity! ;->  But for those who care about this kind of thing, be warned.

2277103,5,B0009CTT6U,"This is one of our most played DVDs, mainly because there are so many of my son's favorite characters crammed into the story.  Thomas fans will be able to identify many of the trains, both steam and diesel, including Thomas, Lady, Diesel 10, Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, Percy, Toby, Harvey, Mavis, Diesel, Iron &#8216;Arry and Iron Bert, and more.

There are five catchy songs, including &#8220;Busy&#8221; which will have you humming all day, and for shorter attention spans there are short breaks in the action for cartoon challenges.

In this story, there is to be a new airport built on Sodor, which will bring in lots of visitors to the Island.  Unfortunately, this also brings the Steam Engines into close contact with the Diesels, and before long the island is in chaos as train warfare breaks out.  To compound matters, a storm hits the island, further delaying the work schedule.

With the vacation season plans headed for disaster, Thomas rallies the engines to work together and be really useful, but the real challenge will be to finish everything on time.  A last minute emergency might put a damper on things, but maybe a little help from an unlikely source can save the day.

Entertaining and educational, this one is a must for any Thomas fan.

2277104,5,B0009CTT6U,"This is a wonderful video and we highly recommend it. Besides having tons of Engines (of both a coal and oil persuasion), Harold, and Sir Topham Hatt, there is a pretty good story about cooperation, and the fact that our differences are what make us special.

The story begins with an announcement that a new airport is going to be built. Orders are given to both the Diesels and the Steamies but trouble starts when Thomas decides to play tricks on `Arry and Bert, and Diesel. In one case, Thomas substitutes bananas for construction materials.

He and Percy have a good laugh, but soon find that everything has backfired. When they go home they find that one of the important jobs the diesels had was to rebuild their sheds. The old sheds were destroyed on time, but there was no supplies to build new ones. Consequently the gang are split up into shelters all over the island.

This bad situation is made worse when a hurricane rips through the island. What little work that was done on the airport is undone, and the beautiful new suspension bridge is mostly gone!

The Steamies decide that they need to work really hard now, but their plans fall in disarray as the Diesels retaliate to Thomas' pranks. [This is a good opportunity to point out to children that actions have consequences: good and bad.]

This long story, much like the television versions, are interrupted with breaks of music and games. In the case of this Video, the games involve practice logical reasoning skills. And unlike the TV show, most of the game-breaks have something to do with the story. For example, the first break comes after a mention of the age-old animosity that exists between the Steamies and Diesels. A discussion ensues about what the real differences between steam engines and diesels engines are. Steamies use coal and have whistles, for example, while diesel engines burn oil and have horns.

In any case, real trouble comes as biffing and bashing begin to go on all over the island. Things go so badly that the Steamies all begin to have nightmares as to what might happen to them if no tourists come. Everyone but Thomas. He dreams of Lady who he finds high in the mountains, shunting cars with Rusty. She tells him something to the effect that she and Rusty always get their work done with they cooperate.

This sets the wheels in motion and soon everyone is working together and everything is done... until an accident which, at the last moment, takes the runway out of commission. What can they do? Thomas (the principal good guy and Steamie) finds the solution in asking Diesel 10 (a former principal bad guy, now more realistically portrayed (lol) as a lead grumpy, strong, and scary diesel) for help. Yeah differences. Yeah cooperation. Just the stuff for small fry.

Five Stars. Good story. Good lessons. We also get to learn a lot more about Sodor on this video and we certainly get to see lots of trains. I don't know what parents of younger children find, but I know that my almost 4 year-old son loves this video.

However, the steamies and diesels cannot get along and bang and bash and bump into each other (supposedly a train's version of WF wrestling). The engines dream about what would happen if none of their work had been done, but in Thomas's dream, he finds out how he can make things right. He teams up with Mavis to start making the steamies and diesels work together.

This DVD is just about the same as the Thomas & Friends TV show, due to the games and songs in between. You will also get to see many of the lesser known characters, including Diesel 10, Harvey, George, Devious Diesel, and Lady, all five of which are featured in the new ""Calling All Engines"" gift pack. Worth the extra money if you have some of the wooden railway sets.

Also, the special features on this DVD are great! There is a read-along story of ""Diesel 10 Means Trouble,"" a ""Calling All Engines"" interactive game, deleted scenes, and much much more!

Please note: The only thing I'm not too crazy about on this DVD is the commercials at the end of the film. (I'm not fully fond of Hit's other nots-so-hit TV productions, especially since Thomas isn't in their multi-show videos.)

My sister loved Lady and she was so happy to see her back in this new DVD. As a veteran Thomas fan I was really glad to see a lot of the old time engines back Boco, Daisy, Duck, Oliver, etc. I don't know how many new editions have gone by without BoCo but they seem to be making up for it now.

One problem I have with the new DVDs is the amount of advertising that gets put in it. It gets so annoying and even young children can notice. I've never been a fan of the games that are between each episode either, and my little sister is constantly bored by them. It was a lot of fun back in the older days when each episode was separated by a list of the engines but the games are a little more educational.

We are both huge Thomas fans and so I write this review with mixed emotions. I would like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD, but alas, even my precocious wee one, likes this video less than its predecessor, Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000)

The storyline of Calling All Engines is entertaining, the scenery, as in all episodes of Thomas and Friends, is outstanding, and the songs are entertaining. The DVD also contains bonus features including an interactive game, a read-along story, Diesel 10 Means Trouble, character gallery (the weakest of the bonus features), deleted scenes, and a music video. Although diehard Thomas and Friends fans will enjoy this video, there are problems with the film that make Calling All Engines substandard.

Although HIT Entertainment has great success with its television programming, they seem to fall short when it comes to producing feature length programs.

Michael Brandon fails miserably as the ""storyteller."" He seems unable to remain in character for more than a few seconds and oftentimes slips from a character's voice to the narrator's voice in mid dialogue. Furthermore, in several places he mispronounces words, for example, bananas is pronounced ""bananers."" He evens manages to mispronounce Sir Topham Hatt's name! These are problems that should have been corrected with ADR, but for some reason HIT entertainment choose not to do so.

The continuity and flow of the story are destroyed by the frequent interludes where Mr. Brandon asks the viewing audience to make choices for the characters, or to teach little lessons. For example, the story is interrupted, early on, for almost four minutes to ask the audience to identify characteristics that set steam and diesel engines apart. If this interruption in some way advanced the plot, or assisted in the development of the characters it might be acceptable, but it does neither. Finally, these interludes are often animated which is visually distracting given the care that was taken in creating and photographing the other scenes.

In addition, the film is advertised as being ""closed captioned"" which it is not.

For all its flaws, Thomas and the Magic Railroad which incorporated stop action photography and live action was a far more rewarding film. Perhaps in its next outing HIT entertainment will take what it has learned from these two efforts in full length Thomas features and produce the kind of film that Thomas and his friends deserve.",1128988800,7,2595,5.122931442080378

The main downfall are breaks in the story (Help Thomas pick the right cargo, which route should Thomas take, etc) but they're not interactive, and they can wreck the flow of the story. Most of the breaks are simply rendered CGI sequences, which is jarring for me because I admire the work they put in to the ""real"" sets.

As maligned as ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad"" is, I did like how that movie had different actors doing voices for each of the trains and I wish they had done this for this DVD.  That said, Michael Brandon is my favorite narrator (tied w/ Ringo, I love how he does Gordon, so upper class sounding) and he does a good job.

The songs are OK, nothing too special.  My son wanted Spencer in the movie. Sorry son, no luck there.

DVD extras - the usual story book, character gallery on the other Thomas DVDs. The songs and the breaks are grouped into one submenu, and there's a game we haven't tried yet.

8058969,1,B0009CTT6U,"I'm sorry but this is THE WORST THOMAS MOVIE EVER MADE! The plot is just steamies vs diesels and the airport being build. This movie is just so bad. The worst negative is Diesel 10. Diesel 10 is so out of character. In Thomas and the Magic Railroad Diesel 10 was evil and hurts anyone who gets in his way, here Diesel 10 is just someone who just wants to help the other engines and it is horrible. It was nice Lady returned but she should be running the magic railroad instead of working in the high hills with Rusty. The moral is good because it shows if you work together and put your differences aside you can achieve something faster, but the problem is that the engines don't remember this for future episodes or movies so why bother with the moral. There were other nice returns like Mavis, George, and Derek who was in the music video Busy. Busy was too catchy and I could not get it out of my head, and Trying to do things Better talks about the moral and gets annoying. Overall this movie is Garbage. Skip this Movie. This is not a great example of Thomas for the kids. Try the other ones.",1505606400,,1098,4.258373205741627
