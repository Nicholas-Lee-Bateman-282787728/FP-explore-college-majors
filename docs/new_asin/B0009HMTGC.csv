8060944,3,B0009HMTGC,"Bugsy Siegel. This name is synonymous with Organized Crime, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Murder and Mystery. A fascinating character, Siegel's name is now more popular than ever. Born Benjamin Siegelbaum in Brooklyn, New York in 1906, Bugsy began his career as a small time extortionist on New York's Lower East Side. Then a few years later he'll become friend with Meyer Lansky, and New York would never be the same again. Because of his notoriously quick and violent temper, he became one of the most infamous and feared gangsters of his day. More than 60 years after his death people are still debating on who might have committed the crime. Bugsy might be dead, but his legend will live forever. A&E's award-winning series BIOGRAPHY profiles the life of the infamous gangster in this 50 minutes documentary. In this documentary you'll learn more about Bugsy's childhood, the birth of Murder Inc, his rise to the top and his brutal demise.

Over the past few months I have seen a lot of documentaries about The Mafia, Organized Crime and Gangsters. In my opinion CRIME INC ( 1984, available here on Amazon ) and LORDS OF THE MAFIA ( hosted by Robert Stack ) are the best documentary series ever made about Organized Crime. Since I've watched these two amazing series many times let's say that I wasn't very impressed by this documentary about Bugsy. You'll enjoy watching this documentary if, like me, you read a lot of books or watch plenty of documentaries about The Mob, but overall this documentary was a disappointment. I was expecting a lot more. First of all the documentary is way too short. 50 minutes to cover such a complex character is ridiculous, this should have been at least 100 minutes long ( 2 episodes ). Also, like a fellow reviewer wrote, they always shows the same pictures of Bugsy, I think they could have done a better job and could have found a little more footage of him. On the positive side the narrator is good, the music is good too. There's one or two mistakes in the narration, but overall the documentary is very accurate and well researched. The main problem with this documentary is that, in my opinion, this is not the kind of documentary you'll watch over and over again. This is what I like so much about CRIME INC or LORDS OF THE MAFIA, I can watch these series a hundred times and will never get bored of watching them. This is not the case with this documentary. I watched it twice, and I seriously don't think I'll watch it ever again. Another disappointment is how little time is spent talking about the numerous theories about Bugsy's death. I seriously think that the documentary would have been better if they would have spent a good 15-20 minutes on the murder of Bugsy, and if a series of guests would have debated about who might have committed the crime and why. Maybe they could have spent an entire episode on Bugsy's life, and another episode on his death, that would have been a great idea. The death of Siegel is one of the most fascinating Unsolved Murder case in the history of the United States, I think they should have spent a little more time talking about it.

Overall this is still a good addition if, like me, you really enjoy watching documentaries about the Mob. This documentary is far from being perfect but I think it's a good addition to a collection. If you can buy it for a decent price ( say less than 10$ ) then go for it, just don't expect to learn anything new about Bugsy or Organized Crime.
