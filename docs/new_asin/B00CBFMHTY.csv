I'm a very active person and I walk regularly both for fitness and to empty the dog, but that covers only some parts. Each time I have tried to work out more on my own, I have hurt myself but with this I feel safe. Even my wife, who bought the DVD after hearing me complain once again about not being able to find anything that was sustainable, uses it. It works for both of us just as well, although we use it at different times just to make sure we have another 35 years of marriage. I am finally exercising again.",1370217600,,614,4.040983606557377
