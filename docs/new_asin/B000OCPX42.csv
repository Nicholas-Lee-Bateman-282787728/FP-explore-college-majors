2793106,4,B000OCPX42,"The Cat & the Canary was the eleventh film Bob Hope appeared in. It's the old haunted house theme that has what would be called, today, cliches. That doesn't detract from the film because they weren't really cliches for 1939. In some of the scenes it almost feels like Hope is doing radio, it's typical Hope, he's ever the coward. Hope's co-star, Paulette Goddard, only makes her ninth appearance in a movie.

The film takes place in a haunted house in an isolated Louisiana bayou. The cast is brought there to hear the reading of the will of the man who had owned the house & had died ten years previous. Wallie Campbell (Bob Hope) is an actor that's related to the deceased as are all of the characters that have been summoned to attend. Joyce Norman (Paulette Goddard) is the one that gets named sole heir. Wallie & Joyce had previously dated in high school & one can tell that Wallie is still smitten.

The problem at hand isn't just the will. It seems that the relatives have had a history of madness running in their genes. A second heir has been named in a sealed envelope; no one knows the name except the lawyer, Crosby (George Zucco), this second heir will inherit if the first proves to be mad or dies prematurely. Miss Lu (Gale Sondergaard has been the caretaker. Sondergaard makes her normal sinister presence & she makes a perfect suspect. Also on hand are Charlie Wilder (Douglass Montgomery) who's the nice guy, always willing to help; Fred Blythe (John Beal) who's always angry & accusing everyone else which makes him a likely suspect; there's Aunt Susan (Elizabeth Patterson) & her niece, Cicily (Nydia Westman).

The film has a monster, hidden passages, eyes peeping out from a painting, secret panels, etc. It's entertaining stuff that Hope fans will enjoy.

The condition of the film, as other reviewers have mentioned, isn't great but it IS very watchable, it's just a tad out of focus looking. There aren't any bonus features & here's hoping that one day someone will get around to restoring this film.",1226188800,,2026,4.682584269662922
2793107,4,B000OCPX42,"This review is really to confirm what a couple of other (British) reviewers have said:although this isn't a pristine copy of the film of the standard of Ghost Breakers it is currently the best version available. Both sound and picture are far superior to the Region 2 version and well worth buying simply for that. That's not to say there aren't faults with this copy,there are,but even so I would defintely recommend this until someone like Universal gets back the copyright and issues a decent version worthy of this classic film.

As for the film itself,well,it's a classic,one of Hope's best movies. Funny and scary,a formula that's often been copied but never been bettered,it is the pinnacle of the old dark house kind of movie. If you're going to buy it,then currently,mid-2008,this is the copy to buy.",1217635200,,809,4.905109489051095

2793109,4,B000OCPX42,"This rarely seen Bob Hope comedy is a delight to see. But it does not hold up well against the original silent version.  The original mood & atmosphere is gone, what you have here is a brisk old house mystery/comedy.  It stands up well on its own, and is best seen without watching the original.

My reason for only four stars is because the Nostalgia Family DVD is really a DVD-r copied from a 3/4 video tape. There is a slight blurriness to some objects not common to professional DVDs.  It is not enough to distract from the enjoyment of this film, but buy it with the understanding that it will not measure up to the picture quality of Universal's Bob Hope DVDs.",1194220800,20,666,4.390243902439025
2793110,5,B000OCPX42,"In 1939, Paramount Pictures released the second film adaptation of John Willard's stage play THE CAT AND THE CANARY. This version just might be the second best example of the ""old dark house"" sub-genre, the first being, what else,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Old-Dark-House/dp/B00000ILEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Old Dark House</a>&nbsp;itself. What makes this version of THE CAT AND THE CANARY so very good is Bob Hope being cast as the movie's lily-livered but very funny hero. Star making role? Surely.

It wasn't a dark and stormy night, more like a gloomy and atmospheric late afternoon somewhere in the bayous of Louisiana, where we glimpse a man being ferried on a boat towards the old, bleak-looking Norman mansion. He is the family lawyer, come to read the will of old, decade-long-deceased Cyrus Norman, who in his time was eccentric and so crooked that ""when he died they had to screw him into the ground."" Shortly after, six farflung relations of the Norman clan gather to see who'll win the lottery.

Amongst the arrivals are radio personality Wally Campbell (Hope) and magazine illustrator Joyce Norman (beautiful Paulette Goddard), who had been childhood chums. The family lawyer reads the will and declares Joyce the sole benefactor, but with certain provisos. Due to a persistent streak of insanity which runs in the family, a second inheritor was secretly named. This person stands to gain should Joyce turn out to be of unsound mind. A further clause states that this second inheritor will also profit should Joyce meet her death within a month of inheriting (hmmm...).

The others are naturally dissatisfied and soon prepare to depart. But transportation doesn't arrive until morning, and so, they're forced to spend the night at this old dark house. Mention is off-handedly made of a treasure in the guise of a diamond and emerald-studded necklace hidden somewhere on the premises. Then the guests hear uneasy news of a crazed killer recently escaped from the local insane asylum. And, in this decaying edifice, deep-seated grudges and frayed nerves soon play out, giving rise to suspicion and stark terror. Is it a surprise that, very soon, people begin to vanish? Then, the murders begin.

I've a fondness for these moody ""old dark house"" spine-tinglers, which specialized in mystery, terror, and humor. I've been searching and waiting for a dvd copy of THE CAT AND THE CANARY for so long. This might've been the one which made me a Bob Hope enthusiast. At a running time of only 73 minutes, this movie clips along at a very brisk pace. Absenting the stormy weather, all the other ingredients for this sub-genre are here: creaking noises, the shady servant, a painting with eyeholes, hidden passageways, and lurking, shadowy figures. And murder, of course. What fun.

But, again, it's worth noting that Bob Hope made this film stand out, as he offsets the delicious chills with his brand of cowardice and casual one-liners. By today's demanding criteria, this movie wouldn't scare the snot out of anyone above the age of nine. Nowadays, this is more a great nostalgia piece than anything. In its time, this film raked in enough box office cred and popularity to garner a reteaming of Hope and Goddard, which they do a year later in another worthy ""old dark house"" romp&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ghost-Breakers/dp/B00005UMF5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ghost Breakers</a>.

As for Paulette Goddard, I've only ever seen her in her two films with Hope, her two movie pairings with Chaplin, and in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Second-Chorus/dp/B000FILVP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Second Chorus</a>, in which her character is romanced by Fred Astaire and Burgess Meredith. What's not to like? She was beautiful, engaging, and had a deft and light touch with her lines. She should've made a bigger mark in Hollywood. Meanwhile, if Hope provides the levity in THE CAT AND THE CANARY, then Gale Sondergaard adds much to the creepy goings-on. She's great as the sternly clad housekeeper who is also a devout spiritualist. It is she who dramatically warns the guests that spirits have warned her of imminent death in the household. She also persists in making ominous statements. When the family lawyer comments on the clock, she declares: ""It stopped when the master died."" Or when the lights eerily flicker: ""Sometimes they get into the machinery."" With her forbidding demeanor and detached delivery, she pulls it off quite well. And she's kinda hot. In a haughty housekeeper kind of way.

I haven't caught the silent 1927 film adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cat-and-the-Canary-Special-Edition/dp/B0006L0LMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cat and the Canary (Special Edition)</a>, but I hear good things about it.

There might even have been a spooky house thriller/comedy with Fred MacMurray, I think it was titled MURDER, HE SAYS?

By the way, for the curious, the movie title THE CAT AND THE CANARY comes from a reference in a psychology book which Joyce finds. According to numerous experiments, a canary, when placed in near proximity to a cat, will often die of fright. Another fun fact I learned thru watching this film is that, in the swamps, a woman apparently keeps her shoes on when she goes to bed.",1187481600,50,6578,5.816390041493776

I do enjoy most of those old 40s pictures and I looked forward to revisiting this one.  Although it was touted as ""used but in excellent condition,"" it did appear rather beat up when unwrapped.  Upon trying to play it, it proved not to be in good condition.  The film was cloudy and blurred and then it quit playing.  Only by pushing the advance button could I get it to move on.  It moved to about the first third of the movie and then it did play to the end, and the picture cleared up a bit.  What was particularly upsetting was I thought I was paying a small sum for the item around $12.00 as I remember that was the amount advertised by the seller, but when I received the movie I found I had paid $38.00 plus freight.

Directed by Elliott Nugent

Bob Hope's status as a star was assured with his role as Wally Campbell, the cowardly protector of Joyce Norman (Paulette Goddard), who must spend one night in the eerie mansion of her late, eccentric, millionaire uncle. If she can make it through the night without losing her mind, Joyce stands to inherit her uncle's entire fortune. Of course, all the other potential heirs now have a motive to drive her insane. The frights are nonstop as hands reach out from nowhere, people disappear between trap doors, the halls echo with terrifying sounds, and secret doorways lead to hidden passageways. Three people are murdered before Wally solves the mystery and sees Joyce through the night.

Creepy lighting and music aid director Elliott Nugent in crafting an effective and fun version of one the genre's archetypal stories.

Bob Hope was the first comedian who's mouth provided the punchline. The Cat and the Canary was his first leading part and yet it's not designed purely for his advantage, this is a great picture, both funny and exciting.

Hope & Paulette Goddard were to team two further times: another haunted house film, The Ghost Breakers (1940) & Nothing But The Truth (1941).

8184249,4,B000OCPX42,"On the night of the 10th anniversary of the death of Cyrus Norman the remaining heirs gather at his mansion in the middle of the Louisiana bayous in order to discover who will inherit his millions.

Those present are:  Lawyer Crosby (George Zucco); Miss Lu, the housekeeper (Gale Sondergaard); Susan Tilberry (Elizabeth Patterson); Cicily Young (Nydia Westman); Fred Blythe (John Beal); Charlie Wilder (Douglass Montgomery); our beautiful damsel in need of protection Joyce Norman (Paulette Goddard) and, of course, our hero Wally Campbell (Bob Hope - seven little foys).

The Will states that, due to the inherited strain of insanity, that the heir must spend the night in Old Man Norman's room.  Should they not survive the night, or if they loose their mind, then the inheritance will pass to a second heir (whose name is in a second envelope).  Since no-one knows who the alternative heir is, they all have a vested interest in seeing the heir dead or insane.

They are forced to stay on the island until the following morning.  As they settle in a guard from the nearby asylum arrives at the house to warn them that a maniac known as ""The Cat"" is on the loose.

This was Bob Hope's first screen appearance as the bumbling coward who tries to be a hero.

This film is a classic black and white comedy/thriller, but it is in need of care and restoration because the copies produced from the original source are not of the greatest quality - the picture is a little fuzzy and grainy, and the sound has an underlying hiss. To be honest, it looks like it has been copied from my old video tape.  These copying faults let down what is a 5 star film.",1255478400,3,1648,4.613013698630137
8184250,2,B000OCPX42,"I agree with everyone else that this is a great film, but this DVD is unwatchable on a video projector. This is a second-or-third generation 3/4"" video tape copy and is totally smeared and fuzzy. And this piece of doo-doo cost me $19.

I thought this was an official release, but somehow this Paramount film has apparently fallen into public domain. I only hope that some other video company can track down the negative and do a proper transfer. Until then, you can watch this on your laptop in a tiny window. It shouldn't look as bad as it does on my 6' screen.

If you've got a mojo for a Bob Hope horror comedy, his next film was ""The Ghostbreakers"" and is available from MCA in great condition.",1244419200,9,698,4.403100775193798

8184252,4,B000OCPX42,"The Cat and the Canary is one of Bob Hope's early films, and is very entertaining.  I took a chance on it, having never seen it and I'm glad I did.  There is plenty of Hope's brand of humor along with some spooky scenes, and of course Paulette Goddard looks as good as always.  The plot isn't complex, but then again it is a comedy with some very good actors & actresses in it, so the humor, the acting and the interesting characters (a lot of these) make this a worth-while buy.  One thing I like about Hope is that I can watch some of his films a 2nd or 3rd time and catch a quick joke that I missed the last time.  He's fast and has great timing.  See if you can keep up.  Overall, perhaps not the greatest film of it's decade, but it is a very nice one, quite funny, and best of all, it entertains, which is what a good film should do.",1226880000,,839,3.9880239520958085
