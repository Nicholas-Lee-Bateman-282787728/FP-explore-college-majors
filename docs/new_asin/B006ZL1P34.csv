5040966,4,B006ZL1P34,"We own the DVD versions of all four of these films.  Not sure the video was ""scrubbed"" or cleaned for the Blu-Ray release.  Having them on one disc is useful as the kids can watch all four without the risk of scratching while changing discs.  No real extras.  Good value as the price of the disc (when I purchased) was affordable.",1402876800,,330,4.360655737704918

5040968,3,B006ZL1P34,"I got this on sale for my wife, too bad I only found out after the fact that she watched all of them. The image quality is ok. They obviously didn't do any enhancements for these films, but the transfer is kind of poor with the films looking dull.",1398470400,4,247,4.061224489795919

5040972,5,B006ZL1P34,"First off, I have been a Pokemon fan since it came to America in '98. So this will be from a the perspective of a fan. The films themselves are your typical kids movie, something happens and the protagonist has to save the day. That said they have more action packed in than the show and kids will love these movies. At 4 for 7.99, this deal is incredible. However, the films quality varies because they took the original format the films were in and put them on a Blu-Ray disc. I understood this going in so it wasn't an issue for me. If you were expecting consistent, high Blu-Ray quality that will disappoint you. There is a slight Theatrical style grain to the films. I love it, but again, something you as the consumer to be aware of. Personally, the few quirks don't bother me at all nor do they affect my opinion on the item. But for 7.99 the minor issue or varied image quality shouldn't be important! Overall, 5 out of 5",1393804800,2,929,4.314285714285714
5040973,5,B006ZL1P34,Fun fun fun fun. Reminiscence of some good cartoons which may get scarece as time progress. Teaches good deeds with fun.,1393718400,,120,4.761904761904762
5041024,5,B006ZL1P34,"I bought this when the dvd was priced $5--I am thrilled with the value and my daughter is thrilled with the content. She has enjoyed watching the movies and I am still in shock that I didn't have to pay way more for four movies. As for the content of the movies--well, if you've watched Pokemon before, you know what to expect, right? I find the shows cheesy and predictable but my 7-year old stays absolutely focused until the end credits roll. I couldn't be happier with this purchase unless they had given it to me free :)",1392940800,,525,4.36734693877551

5041026,5,B006ZL1P34,Not being on the continental U.S. makes it hard to find Pokemon to watch on TV so my son was excited about the movies,1392681600,,117,3.9166666666666665
5041027,5,B006ZL1P34,Ah the nostalgia. Watching these films in blu-ray takes me back. Some films though are no better than an upscaled dvd but nevertheless its passable IMO.,1392163200,,152,4.884615384615385
5041028,5,B006ZL1P34,I absolutely love this 4 pack of Pokemon Movies the quality is great and on Blu-Ray which was a plus also the price wass only $5 and around $14 after shipping and tax which I thought was great.

5041033,4,B006ZL1P34,"Quite Frankly, for the price I paid, 4 movies is a bargain! The quality in all 4 movies can vary, however I didn't feel that the quality was bad enough for the movies to not be watchable.",1389398400,,187,4.081081081081081
5041044,4,B006ZL1P34,"Worked great and the cost was super awesome. The only downfall might be that occasionally you can't start a movie by clicking it, but have to use the chapters and select the first chapter. Still worth it!",1386720000,,204,4.54054054054054

He and his mom were thrilled with the contents as they had never seen or heard of Pokemon.  It made a wonderful gift item to keep kids entertained.  Very reasonably priced, too.",1376092800,3,325,4.17741935483871

5041051,4,B006ZL1P34,"I know that the newer pokemon films are on blu ray, but that being said the older ones are not. I'm glad that they finally released these on Blu Ray, because i can't watch SD anymore, but when it comes to anime i will if it is not available on blu ray (YUGIOH SEASONS 1 - 5) I instantly bought this, even if my bank account doesn't agree with my purchase. I personally think any pokemon fan should buy this, but why the 4 stars? Well thats a simple answer, its the video quality, but not what you might be expecting, the image quality is AMAZING. some people seem to dislike the film grain, but i prefer this and it makes me sad that now hollywood is switching to digital. But the problem is that the transfers are not the best, mainly the transfer of pokemon 4ever. Its shaky, almost like a someone was trying to film a movie in theaters. Don't get me wrong its watchable, but during still shots its really noticeable. The audio is some what a hit and miss, the older two are only stereo and the new ones claim to have  5.1 surround sound, but heres the things, when putting the blu ray into my computer and doing an examination i couldn't find the 5.1 surround sound, but revealed that all audio on the disc was in stereo. So i am unsure what they are claiming surround sound is. I understand that they could be using dolby pro logic which can simulate surround sound in a stereo track but i am unsure if this is what they did. Other then that i am very happy with this, and i hope they learn from their mistakes with this pack and release the first 3 on blue ray soon.",1370995200,,1571,4.201986754966887

5041053,5,B006ZL1P34,"When I saw that you could buy Movie 4 through 8 on one Blu-Ray disc, I jumped for joy. You get Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Jirachi: Wishmaker and Pokemon: Destiny Deoxys in great quality. The latter two are higher quality than the former two however, all movies look excellent. I would recommend this to all Pokemon fans!",1368230400,2,332,4.741379310344827
