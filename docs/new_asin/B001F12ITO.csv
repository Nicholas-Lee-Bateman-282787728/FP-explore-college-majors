3559727,5,B001F12ITO,I really enjoy this dvd. You can view and practice the moves or begin the work out (i suggest practicing the move first unless you have ballroom experience.) Its up tempo and a lot of fun.,1234483200,3,188,4.25

3559741,2,B001F12ITO,"Save your money.  This is probably the worst dance video I have ever tried.  I did it only once and did not finish.  I guess you are supposed to know what the steps are before you get the video.  I'm not a good or trained dancer but I can usually follow moves, especially if I stop the video and go over them a couple of times (which I did) but, alas, there were a couple of moves that I just couldn't get and they were not explained.  If you have done ballroom dance for years or are just a great dancer, you might love this.  I didn't.",1407456000,,537,3.97196261682243
3559742,5,B001F12ITO,"I'm 57 year old post menopausel woman with fibromyalgia and various spinal injuries/surgeries. I've always loved to dance but had limited most of my exercise to swimming until I began throwing my back out even in the pool! This video purchase was an act of desperation. I've tried many other dance videos in the past but found that they were too hard and gave them to my daughters. With patience and repetition I can do most of this video without modification and it is fun. It was a revelation to me how much fear I had about moving my hips and how stiff I had been walking for so many years. This video helped me to overcome this without injury and it actually HELPS me feel so much better! Before I began doing this video, when I got out of bed in the morning my back was so painful and weak I felt as though it would not support me. Now I can frequently get out of bed without any back pain! This is so wonderful! I know how the tin man felt on The Wizard of Oz after Dorothy oiled him! My core strength is becoming stronger and I'm getting compliments on my shapely thighs! Another thing this video does is make me sweat; I am being treated for hypo-thyroid and don't  sweat when I workout. I actually sweat and that is such a healthy thing for our bodies to do. I'm very thankful I bought this video.",1394841600,2,1306,4.244979919678715
3559743,5,B001F12ITO,"I love it. Some of it is a little difficult because I am 86 years old, but I am able to modify some of the steps to make it easier. Still cannot do all of it, but I am working on doing more as I practice  it longer. DVD in excellent condition.",1387670400,,243,3.673076923076923
3559744,5,B001F12ITO,"The workout is fun. It gets your heart rate up. It teaches you some nice dance moves too. Kristina is pleasant to watch, listen to, and follow. It's in my regular rotation of cardio dance workouts.",1381795200,,197,4.5
3559745,5,B001F12ITO,I really liked this DVD. Kristina walks you thru the steps in the guide and continues during the program. I have a hard time doing my other higher impact DVDs now due to knees but am able to follow along and work up a sweat while not hurting myself. She has good cuing and makes it fun. If you are at a fitter level it may not be as challenging but would make a fun break in your routine.,1374537600,2,388,3.9240506329113924
3559746,1,B001F12ITO,I did not like this! The intructor is EXTREMELY ANNOYING!!! I did not like this! Do not buy this product!!!,1356739200,,107,4.4
3559747,5,B001F12ITO,I wish she had more workouts-a great instructor with a great voice-no pump you up yelling. Good dance moves and a really good separate segment teaching the steps as well. You can tell she's a real dancer.,1356393600,,204,4.54054054054054
3559748,5,B001F12ITO,The steps are easy and fun to follow. I sweat a bit and the heart rate increases as well. It's not exhaustive though. This is a nice DVD to add to my collection for work out!,1356048000,,174,3.861111111111111
3559749,4,B001F12ITO,This DVD is cool. The quality of the DVD is good and the instruction given by instructor is pretty easy to follow. It is really step by step so to speak.,1349654400,2,153,3.967741935483871
3559750,3,B001F12ITO,"Though I have taken ball room classes before, this video just does not really do it for me.

I will have to give it some more time I guess.  I think the lesson are ok.  But I need more motivation.

But I have only attempted it a few times maybe it will grab my attention later.

I will keep at it.

I do like the fact that it breaks it down for comprehension but I need more motivation and a little bit more excitement from the instructor.",1330732800,2,439,3.9885057471264367
3559751,5,B001F12ITO,"If you like to watch DANCING WITH THE STARS check out this dvd. You learn actual dance steps! It is challenging and fun. The dvd comes with a section on the specific steps that you can practice to make them less confusing. It also has specific chapters to be able to review ust the Cha-cha or just the Samba or just the Jive. Prompting is great and music doesn't overpower the workout. Wish they would come out with another one, but it will probably take you a while to figure this one out and do it well. Great fun workout!",1324771200,,524,4.25
3559752,4,B001F12ITO,Love this work out.  It's fun and the steps are clearly illustrated.  Easy to work at the level you want.  You can take it easy or apply some style and get your heart pumping.,1323734400,,175,4.088235294117647
3559753,4,B001F12ITO,"This video was great for a change of pace. I usually stick to my Jillian Micheals, Jackie Warner and Bob Harper workouts. While this is not a tough workout it is great to shake things up a bit. I was sweating but it is definitely low impact. I thought it was a lot of fun!",1312329600,,272,3.963636363636364
3559754,3,B001F12ITO,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.  I do not have much of a dance background (around one year) and more of a martial arts background.

Instructor, music, moves, backup dancers were fine.  I liked the samba segment most since I had never learned this and I liked the moves.  As a workout, this did not have much in the way of cardio so not a good workout.",1304726400,,374,4.3
3559755,3,B001F12ITO,"As the product description says, this DVD is only 43 minutes. I don't think a 43-minute video is worth $10. That being said, it's a good workout.",1301097600,,145,4.407407407407407
3559756,3,B001F12ITO,"I ordered this DVD because it sounded like it was for a more advanced exerciser who does many dance workouts, but this is geared for a beginner. It is not at a quick enough pace, with too many explanations that slow your momentum so I couldn't keep my  my heart rate up. I did it once and gave it away.",1298073600,,302,4.033333333333333
3559757,5,B001F12ITO,"I have several ballroom DVDs and  absolutely love this one.  First of all, Kristina Milova breaks down the steps for you.  Then you can go on to dance or review the steps as needed.  I was even able to use it to explain certain steps on some of the other DVDs. The only thing I don't like about this feature is that it's difficult to mark your place on each step.  Kristina makes dancing enjoyable.  Some of the DWTS veterans seem to have been sidetracked on the way to make their porn videos.  As a straight woman,  I'm not interested in seeing pouty lips, coy looks and hip huggers that go so far south there is little left to the imagination.  I just want to work my butt off.  Kristina is professional while having fun.  I wish I'd purchased this one first.",1297296000,5,761,4.288732394366197
3559758,4,B001F12ITO,"I really love this video, even though I am a beginner and not in great shape.  I am a SAHM and don't have time to take dance classes, so this is the next best thing.  I got the video a week ago and I've been motivated to work on it every day.  My strategy has been to do the step guide each day.  I've also tried the full routine twice, where I can get through the warm up and the cha-cha.  I see improvement every day and I feel beautiful and stylish and I'm improving my fitness at the same time.  I really like that the focus is on real dance moves rather than an aerobic exercise routine and I find the moves relatively easy to learn.

I gave four stars instead of five for the following reasons:
* It would be nice if the intro was separate from the routine in the main menu so it could be skipped easily.  It IS separate in the chapter menu.
* The step guide should be broken down into chapters, as well, so you could go to a particular step.
* It's hard to go straight from 1/4 time to tempo in the step guide.  Something like 1/2 time in between would be nice.
* During the routine, she doesn't always say what she is going to do next before she does it.  Instead, she says and does it at the same time.
* I'd like to see turns (doing a 360 degree rotation) included in the step guide.  I've had a lot of trouble learning how to do them from within the routine.",1293235200,3,1369,3.9963235294117645
3559769,3,B001F12ITO,"This workout is great, it's a little hard, but with a little practice it's ok. The only problem with this workout it's the music! It's awful, If I would've known that the music was like this, I wouldn't have bought it, unless you don't mind.",1289779200,4,241,4.377777777777778
3559770,5,B001F12ITO,"Like this CD said getting fit doesn't have to feel like workout.  It is excellent and fun, fun, fun, I highly recommend it.",1288483200,,123,4.3478260869565215
3559771,5,B001F12ITO,"I just got this DVD for Christmas and I love it. I have tried several ballroom dancing workout DVD and I find this one to be the easiest to follow while still working up a good sweat. Kristina Milova takes you through three routines based on the Cha Cha, Samba and the Jive. I was kind of surprised to see that she selected the Samba because it tends to be a bit awkward for a beginning dancer (I have 6 years ballroom experience and I still find it awkward) but after you catch the beat it does get easier and Kristina does a great job of reminding you what comes next. This is one of the few workout DVDs I own that feels more like fun than working out.",1263081600,3,655,4.0852713178294575
3559772,2,B001F12ITO,"I've always wanted to dance but never have and I thought this would be a great way to break into it.  I tried watching the step guide and it was horrible.  I found it very difficult to follow along and as soon as I thought I got one step she moved on to the next and it became me just trying to keep up.  The step guide is also a pain as she goes through so many that by the time you get done, you have no idea what you learned in the steps before.  Also, there is no easy way to find what step you want to work on in the step guide so you can't really use it to work on one certain step.  I think this would be great for someone who used to take dance as a kid and wanted to get back into it or something like that but as a beginner I found it difficult and frustrating.",1258675200,3,771,3.705521472392638
3559773,4,B001F12ITO,"I like to exercise via dance, but I am not a former dancer or anything. So I feel qualified to say that this video is probably good for beginners to intermediate level, but probably not suited to someone with alot of dance experience (which is definitely not me!).  What I liked about this DVD is 1) its fun 2) is easy to follow and 3) it not only burns off calories- you WILL learn some genuinely useful dance moves!  So I highly recommend if you want to dance off some inches, which I do!",1257206400,6,490,4.202127659574468

3559775,3,B001F12ITO,I am giving only 3 stars because it was not as good as I expected. I did not enjoy even though I love dancing and I also teach dancing classes at a gym. There were some nice moves and the two other dancers were pretty good. I would not recommend this product. It needs some improvement.,1247270400,,286,4.125
3559776,4,B001F12ITO,"Although I didn't like it at first,  now I really love it.  Kristina is sweet the music is fun and I enjoy moving along with it as the steps are very well explained.  More like this please!",1246924800,2,189,4.054054054054054
3559777,5,B001F12ITO,"It really works out your waist and legs! High energy, easy to learn and keeps me interested in coming back for more!  You'll start sweating from the warm up and not stop until the final bow. Highly recommend it and if anyone knows of any comparable dvds, please let me know.",1246579200,2,274,4.372549019607843
3559778,5,B001F12ITO,"Kristina has a very sweet voice, good timing and good choice of words when instructing. The backup dancers can dance well, unlike other backup dancers in other workouts.
Step Guide 17 min - Kristina alone w/no music shows you how the moves look, first the lower body, then the upper body, slow then fast. Some moves she goes quick, others she really breaks down, though she goes from 1/4 speed straight to tempo which can be frustrating for those who've never danced or never tried dance dvds before.
Workout w/chapters 42 min - Unlike most Dance Off The Inches workouts, this has neither watered-down moves nor is it slow-paced for those who rarely workout. The dance moves are almost all very fast paced so it will take fast footwork & endurance. When Kristina adds a new move to the routine, she will break it down to ease into it.
If you only want to do part of the dvd workout, the first 2 chapters of warm-up & cha-cha moves are built up into a 15 min routine, the samba & jive chapters dance moves are put into a 22 min routine, and the cool down's 5 min. slow-paced moves are different so they can be used w/either.
Some of the dance moves are: volta, botafogo, lock step, side/front cuban, pas de bourree, kick ball change, heel toe heel, several triple steps, turns w/hip circles, etc.
This dvd is best for those who already own a few dance dvds, natural dancer, or taking classes, as well as those who can handle fast-paced aerobics.

It takes a minute (or two) to copy what is being taught; however, with consistent practice, you'll feel like you have the basics of each dance.

It was still challenging for me and fun to learn the routines.  I think it may be hard for people without any dance experience whatsoever.  I did not watch the 10 minute tutorial that breaks down each move--I was able to pick it up just in the routine.  This is a fun break from some of my weight intense workouts, and it does get my heart pumping.

Since I had already exercised for 30 minutes before popping in this DVD, I was so pooped I could hardly dance by the end but the desire to keep going was still there. The moves themselves impressed me. Some of the sample clips on this website for other Dance off the Inches videos tell me that the choreography is especially well done in Dance it off Ballroom. I am in a dance troupe and would generally not use ""workout video moves"" onstage, but will surely be taking some from this one.
