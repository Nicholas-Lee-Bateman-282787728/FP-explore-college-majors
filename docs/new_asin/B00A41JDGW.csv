5381497,4,B00A41JDGW,"Movie was OK, but as a sports movie it failed. More about personalities and personal struggles. Less about the sport itself.",1365379200,,124,4.9523809523809526
5381498,4,B00A41JDGW,"First off, all three DVDs come in the same box.  For the price, I kind of thought each DVD would have its own case.  No biggie though.

The first video, ""Bicycle Dreams"" was pretty good, but a little dry.  Worth a viewing if you're into endurance races or an avid cyclist and just can't get enough of the sport.

The second video, ""22 Bicycle Movies"" was cute enough.  All of the films are of an independent nature and the acting/production value is of the genera.  I found most of them to be pretty good, although there was one or two I didn't really get.  Some were good enough that I looked them up on YouTube as well so I could share them on FaceBook to my other cycling buddies.

The third video, ""Race Across America"" was good.  I get a bit disturbed when it first started, as I thought it was just a copy of ""Bicycle Dreams"".  There is some perhaps stock footage that gets re-used in the beginning of the film, but it picks right up after that.

If I had it to do over, I think I might opt for the 2-pack of ""Race Across America"" and ""22 Bicycle Movies"".  I don't feel cheated or that I wasted any money making the purchase of all three though.",1360022400,,1151,4.200913242009133
5381499,3,B00A41JDGW,"The content of the movies I loved. I watched them while riding my stationary bike which seemed an aporpriate way to watch bike movies. The race across America I was particularly interested in becuase the past summer my nephew and I road our bikes from Montana to West Virginia and intersected RAAM in Ohio near the end of their trip. Those movies were great. ""Bicylce Movies"" dissapointed me. When I place the disk in my Blu-ray player as I had done with the other movies it didn't work. I tired again and  got to the movie menu and started playing and then stopped. I tried playing it with my computer and it worked fine, but there is a big difference between watching on a lap top or on a 42 inch screen TV. I like the content of ""Bicycle Movie"" but not the way the disk wasn't compatible with my Blu-ray.",1359504000,,807,4.344370860927152

8546630,3,B00A41JDGW,"I was disappointed the documentary only focused on the solo riders and didn't also show the teams as well as the officials and volunteers whom all help in making the race possible, on the whole.

I'm sure there's hundreds of hours of footage, therefore, you can possibly sequence together another addition to the first Bicycle Dreams and RAAM Video's.",1454544000,,351,4.9491525423728815

8546633,2,B00A41JDGW,I like all bicycle movies but in this case they were not properly described. So I ended up with 2 movies about same subject and the third one was a bunch oh short movies that I didn't even want.,1420243200,,194,4.0
