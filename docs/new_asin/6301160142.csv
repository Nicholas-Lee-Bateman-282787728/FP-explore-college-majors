I personally like Foofur because of his sage wisdom and good message he sends to kids. This dawg ain't no queer like ""SpongeBath SquarePantsed."" He send a good wholesome message to the kids about walking around on all fours and fighting immorality. I think he even bit a queer in one episode.

Ryan and Billy told me they love Foofur because he's blue, wrinkly, and lovable. That's good enough for me!",1111104000,2,565,4.371428571428571
