8334899,2,B000LMPJNK,"This is a black and white film that comes in a slim case packaging. I did not like the movie because I remember that the original movie had some color song sequences in it, as it was typical of older Hindi films. But this particular edition of this movie was in all black and white, and I felt that the rendition of it was low quality.

I do however like the songs in this movie, and thought it was interesting to watch a Hindi twist on an old Arabian nights story of Ali BaBa and the forty thieves. I would wait for a better rendition of this movie to come along if you are interested in quality.",1339718400,,597,4.102564102564102
