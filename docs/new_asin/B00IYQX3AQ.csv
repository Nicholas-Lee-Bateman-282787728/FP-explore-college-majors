8646496,3,B00IYQX3AQ,"I am a beginner/intermediate and can read music notation but haven't learned to read tab yet. The product description says it features ""downloadable tab and music notation"" for the songs in the set. Only about half of the songs have tab AND music notation...the other half are tab only. I contacted the publisher and they do not have the music notation for the songs in question, and don't know if they'll be able to get it. So, if you don't read tab, beware.",1453939200,3,459,4.542168674698795
8646497,4,B00IYQX3AQ,"For some reason, the info for songs is difficult to find, so I tracked it down and here it is. I do own Gibson's L&M Guitar course and also the L&M Blues Guitar course, and those are top notch. This set was just released. It consists of Gibsons Skills House dvds, and the lessons are NOT taught by Steve Krenz, so you're getting a new point of view from various muscians. The lessons are about 45-60 minutes each. What else is really cool is that at the beginning of the song, they show you how to get the tone of the song, i.e. what type of effects pedals they're using to emulate the sound from the actual song and where exactly to set the dials, ie 9o'clock. So that part is helpful.

Here is the song list:

DVD 1: All Along the Watchtower, American Woman, We are the Champions, Wild Thing
DVD 2: Burnin' for you, Dust in the Wind, Proud Mary, School's Out
DVD 3: La Grange, Rock n' Me, The House is Rockin', Jessica
DVD 4: Are you gonna go my way, Come together, Highway star, No more Mr. Nice Guy
DVD 5: Fool for the City, I Want You to Want Me, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, More Than a Feeling
DVD 6: Come as You Are, Feel Like Makin' Love, Iron Man, Ramblin' Man
DVD 7: Realin' in the Years, Sharp Dressed Man, Slow Ride, Takin' Care of Business
DVD 8: Been Away Too Long, Black Magic Woman, Hot Blooded, Pride and Joy
DVD 9: Killer queen, Mississippi Queen, Smoke on the Water, Suzie Q
DVD 10: (Don't fear) the Reaper, Paranoid, Rock and Roll band, Sweet Home Alabama

The songs sell for $3.99 a piece on Gibsons Skill House site, and you're getting 40 lessons here, so right around the right price. Good selection of songs!
If you were excited as I was to find this, then I'll save you the trouble of searching for the complete song list, which for some reason isn't even on the Legacy L&M website! The item is $109 on the official site as well. Hope this helps!

!!***UPDATE: So I did receive the set. You have to download the TAB and also the backing tracks. You can just pick any disc to start with, theres no set way to go about it, you just dive right in. The production value for the songs and instruction are great. It's nice to get a different perspective on things from various artists. I was expecting there to be TAB on screen, but there's not. So thats kinda a frown. You can download the TAB and backing tracks off the learn and master website. Basically you're learning songs by watching and just doing what the instructor does. This is a great set to supplement and add some fun to your guitar practice! Some of the instructors are more enjoyable than others.

***UPDATE!9/10/14*** Ok, so I've been working on Santana's ""Black Magic Woman"" this week. I've checked out a few other songs, but mainly I've followed through with this song. Well, what I'm finding to be irritating is, the included TAB, which is a 500MB file that took quite a while for me to download, is different than what the guy in the video is telling me to do!!! SUPER IRRITATING!! Granted, yes, I can take a pencil and write in what he is saying, but thats not why I bought this course. Also, the instructor keeps saying the chords are D minor and A minor and then later saying ""oh I mean A7 Minor"" which is another super irritating thing, as my brain reacts to what he says, not to what he means. And, another odd thing, not sure if its the case with all the songs, is, on Black Magic Woman, he only demo's the first couple minutes of the song. NOT the entire song. Also, the TAB is really different than any other TAB I'm familiar with, like bends are notated different and slides are notated different, it's just all off from what I thought was pretty much standard TAB notation.

So far, I'm a little bit irritated by this course. But, all in all, it helps me practice and keeps me interested in learning, so that's good, but I'm not entirely happy I spent $109 on it.

I would say if you're on the fence, pay $3.99 and try out a couple of Gibson's Skills House instructionals on their website and see if you like what's being presented. Make sure to download the TAB as well and see if it matches and also if it's easy for you to understand.

****--UPDATE--***9-19-2014: I moved on to ""Pride and Joy,"" and that teacher is considerably better at conveying how and what to do. He also demonstrates the strumming pattern and was just way more concise and focused on teaching. The TAB on that one is better than the Santana one.",1409011200,20,4421,4.337363966142685
