8166478,5,B000M5AL8O,"This like all the other DVD's that I have watched from the Scorched Earth series is an excellent documentary on the famous German military commander Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (The Desert Fox). While I had read and watched quite a few things on Rommel prior to buying this DVD, the truth is I still learned a few new things by watching it (which really surprised me). This DVD would be perfect for any World War II history or military history buff. Absolutely worth your time and money!",1190851200,4,486,4.597701149425287
