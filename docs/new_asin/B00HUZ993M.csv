6228682,4,B00HUZ993M,"I just purchased the TRUE WOLF DVD from Amazon. I watched it tonight for the first time. I thought the message was very well presented. Koani and Indy were wonderful ""stars"" of the show. The education regarding wolves and the common sense that this DVD delivers regarding wolves is very good and very necessary. The one statement which resonates in my mind is that there have been many fictional stories about wolves which, along with fear, have contributed to the negative view that some people have of these beautiful animals. I hope that the TRUE WOLF DVD will serve to enlighten many people and calm irrational fear of wolves. If so, Koani and Indy will have accomplished their mission in life.",1390953600,6,698,4.776859504132231
6228683,5,B00HUZ993M,"A heartfelt documentary about a couple who gave a big chunk of their lives in rescuing a wolf and
educating the general public about what wolves really are all about.
Great shots of the family and the wolf as they spend years together.
Really enjoyed it...",1390694400,3,256,4.586956521739131
6228684,5,B00HUZ993M,This heartfelt and honest film captures the work of passionate people. A must-see for anyone who loves the beauty of nature & it's toughest advocates.,1390348800,,150,5.04
6228685,5,B00HUZ993M,"I saw True Wolf when it aired in theaters here in Portland, Oregon and was floored at the lack of attendance.  Very excited that the movie is finally available on DVD so we can enjoy it at home.
The additional features add a lot of value to an already great movie buy.
Thanks!",1390348800,3,276,4.2075471698113205
8636162,5,B00HUZ993M,"Excellent DVD. Science based and accurate. Its scary that you still have so many that have no understanding of basic biology and ecosystems, who also think fairy tales are real. I saw one clown  on a YouTube channel claim wolf biologist were part of a government conspiracy to end hunting. Never mind the Feds basically dismantled wolf protection in 2012",1513036800,,354,4.9
8636163,5,B00HUZ993M,Very interesting story loved it.,1503273600,,32,5.6
8636164,4,B00HUZ993M,"This is worth watching though I still have lots of question such as: How did they actually come by this wolf to begin with. The film is not forthcoming about this question and it leaves an unpleasant taste in my mouth. Also, I'm still not certain of the point of the film. It does make you think about our relationship and responsibility to nature and other species though.",1473465600,,373,4.5
8636165,5,B00HUZ993M,"A fascinating true story of how  two humans and a wolf and a dog devoted their lives, for sixteen years, to presenting accurate
information about a misunderstood animal.  The footage is often beautiful and often funny and gives one a sense of participation.
The editing is smooth and professional.  With wolf recolonization in areas like the Pacific Northwest continuing to be highly
controversial, this film is timely and should be widely viewed.",1406419200,,447,5.180555555555555
8636166,5,B00HUZ993M,"An amazing tale of real life with one of our most misunderstood animals. It shows how this species is worthy of our interest, respect and indeed admiration. Learn why current efforts again to eradicate wolves in the American west are a misguided tragedy by seeing for yourself that they do not deserve this thoughtless and irrational treatment. Walter L.

8636167,5,B00HUZ993M,"True Wolf is an extraordinary and moving documentary that examines how misunderstanding and fear have distorted human attitudes towards wolves and how one couple and a wolf named Koani (and a dog named Indy!) set out to change hearts and minds. Koani has passed on but this story deserves to be shared for years to come. Efforts to demonize and eradicate wolves are sadly still with us which makes this film an important part of a national dialogue on the rightful place of wolves in our shared world. I have shown this film to middle school students -- they love it. As a teacher, I love how it promotes critical thinking and open-minded dialogue. An especially inspiring part of the film occurs when a courageous young girl stands up at a public meeting and with her calm words defuses an atmosphere of dangerously mounting anger.",1396742400,,832,4.744827586206896
8636168,5,B00HUZ993M,Wonderfully authentic educational and entertaining. The DVD raises issues and beautifully promotes critical thinking while revealing true commitment and process of human and animal behavior.  Something you can enjoy and learn from with information you will want to share.,1396137600,2,271,5.948717948717949
8636169,5,B00HUZ993M,"This is a wonderful movie.  It is original, very informative, thought provoking, funny and touching.  Watching it once is just not enough.",1396051200,2,138,5.2272727272727275
8636170,4,B00HUZ993M,"Truly interesting to anyone willing to learn more about wolves in general and wolves in captivity in particular !
Also an amazing portrait of the amazing couple who raised this wolf :-)",1393027200,,185,4.8125
8636171,5,B00HUZ993M,"I admit in advance that this story was already familiar to me as the couple who invested a large number of years to raising a wolf in Montana in their 'ambassador wolf' program are well known to me. Because of that, the story seemed too familiar and I wondered how it could be made into an entertaining film Well, the end result of years of labor was impressive: not only continuously entertaining, but full of beauty and sadness, humour and surprises. It exceeded all my expectations and I've already watched it a second time.

The story of two people with an idea, who took in a wolf pup and raised it in their log cabin home, bringing in a dog as well to be her (Koani, the wolf, was a female) companion, unfolds at an unhurried but continuously entertaining pace. Scenes of taking Koani to public schools in order to educate young people the see the wolf as it is, a wild animal, neither a cuddly dog or the cruel monster of myth, and make up their own minds about this animal, are enlightening. Composed of short clips of life at home, exercise in the form of 'wolf walks', feeding, and road trips with their dog and wolf pair, around the country to visit hundreds of schools over the years, are mixed with interviews, commentary, and incident to create a unique and wonderful film.

And the ending is something that one will not soon forget! Beautiful and absolutely perfect, it will leave you feeling as if you too had lived with that wolf in your home...
