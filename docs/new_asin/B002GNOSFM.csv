The stories told by the village people in the country of Malawi are surprising to anyone who has no idea where in the world this country is, and even to anyone who has never left the United States. There is a different world out there and I'm glad Madonna chose to create this film to tell her story to the world.",1250208000,12,407,4.0246913580246915

8369852,5,B002GNOSFM,"A wonderful insightful look at a tragic situation and how people are working to improve the situation.
Thanks to Madonna and many others great strides are being made to help the thousands of children orphaned by the AIDS
epidemic in an African nation.
We should all participate in this very important work,
Bravo and thank you so much for all he people who do this great humanitarian work.",1494806400,,389,4.735294117647059

8369854,5,B002GNOSFM,"At first I didn't watch this documentary because of Madonna, but because my son is going on a 3-month missions trip to Malawi to serve people in need. After watching this documentary however, I was moved by Madonna's own tragedy with losing her mother when she was just 6 years old and, how easily she related to more than one million orphans whose parents died of HIV/AIDS.  This drove the point home and started me on a journey to see what has happened in Malawi since Madonna visited in 2006 and made this documentary. ""I Am Because We Are"" is Malawian culture and, it's their future.",1464566400,,587,4.537735849056604
8369855,4,B002GNOSFM,"Go to a place, in Africa, and see HIV flourish, well as it goes in depth about children, growing up without parents, there are hardly any programs, and these people live in unsanitary homes, with trash on the street, to some people, they are really poor, in need of assistants.",1427760000,,277,4.56
8369856,5,B002GNOSFM,"The story in this video applies far beyond the borders of Malawi - it's what I've seen in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya and beyond.  This is a must for Americans to see to give them a sense of why they should care and act in regards to Africa. The combination of still and video imagery is effective, and many of the still images are incredibly strong in quality and impact.  Should be required viewing in every high school.

8369858,5,B002GNOSFM,"This is a great documentary, and I found very well done made it and informative. Make me wondering many things... and the most loving more the children and their needs, and trying to see how I can help them more. Bravo Madonna.",1258675200,2,227,4.428571428571429
8369859,1,B002GNOSFM,Didn't think much of this DVD. I think Madonna should stick to producing music. Desmond Tutu opinions change which ever way the wind blows and I can 't say much for Bill Clinton. Some of the things he did during his presidency were far from nice. Tutu only speaks to be popular and never seems to upset any body. As for the new age spiritualism it was a load of crap! And if madonna thinks she can sort all the worlds problems she is sadly mistaken. Politicians and diplomats have been trying for generations.,1257465600,,509,4.425531914893617
8369860,3,B002GNOSFM,"""I Am Because We Are"" is Madonna's 2008 documentary film that she produced (throughout 2005-2007) about the ravages of poverty, AIDS and lack of education in the African nation of Malawi where her 2 adpoted children are from. Madonna also appears as herself in the film, too. The film includes subtitles, as well as English speaking audio, in addition to color and even some grainy black and white video clips. ""I Am Because We Are"" is interesting and even shocking in some parts of it, but none of the information is new or even creative. Instead, perhaps Madonna knew that she could get her message out there if she produced this film and simply did not put much effort into it. She did get several high-profile dignitaries to appear on-camera for interviews, including Bishop Tutu and Bill Clinton (I wonder why she didn't ask President Bush?) All proceeds from this film go to Madonna's non-profit charity, Raising Malawi. The film has been shown on on-demand cable outlets around the country as well as on various video sharing sites free of charge; except for a Turkish DVD that came out earlier this year, this is the first DVD.",1250294400,8,1135,4.766497461928934
