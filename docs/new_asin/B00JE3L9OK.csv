8650149,5,B00JE3L9OK,"This Item contains all five films in their original individual packaging and all dvds have the full list of special features. Unfortunately English subtitles were only provided by the filmmakers for the last four films in the series. Story elements and characters are continued throughout all films so best to watch them in order. While the game of soccer plays a part in each movie; keep in mind that the story as a whole is meant to transition from real life to fantasy (as most boys minds do) and you won't have a problem with it. Great fun to watch and Extras, while not subtitled, are still enjoyable too. Looking forward to next generation DWK6.",1451692800,,651,4.6695652173913045
