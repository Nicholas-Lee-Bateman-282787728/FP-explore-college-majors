4188135,5,B003SG8136,"I loved this video! I was very surprised that the intensity was so high, after experiencing some pretty uninspiring videos from the Firm lately. I love Allison, she is my favorite instructor. She cued well, her energy was not over the top annoying, and she produced a very effective tough workout! My heart was racing the whole time, I want more videos from the Firm like this! Thumbs up!",1282521600,24,388,4.63768115942029
4188136,5,B003SG8136,"I have done many firm workouts. Alison Davis-McLain is one of my favorite instructors because I like her routines, no nonsense approach, and accurate cueing.  I was looking forward to this DVD and was not disappointed.  You definitely create a calorie explosion! You will need weights (about 3-10 lbs) to get the most from the video.  There are 4 12-minute sections that you can do separately or combine into one long routine:

Kick-Butt Athletic Drills
Explosive Power Moves
Cardio Kickboxing
High-Intensity Moves

Another reviewer has gone into great detail about the routines, so I will just add that they are typical Firm routines (lots of lunges, squats, and compound moves with weights) with a few new moves thrown in for variety. If you like the Firm, you will definitely like this DVD, or it is a great introuction to the series for newbies.",1280361600,43,849,4.909090909090909
4188137,5,B003SG8136,"After a couple disappointing workouts from The Firm, this one is a breath of fresh air!!  It is a toughie. I absolutely loved the intensity of this workout.  My HR (which runs a bit on the high side) stayed between 165 - 185 bpm!  You will need weights, anywhere from 3-10 lbs.  I began with 5 lbs., but ended up having to alternate between 3 lb. and 5 lb. throughout the workout.

Alison Davis-McLain is the lead instructor for every workout. Rebekah Sturkie & Emily Welsh are also in the workouts. Emily modifies for those looking to lighten it up a tad. I was hoping that the instructors would alternate since Rebekah & Emily are my favorites, plus changing instructors feeds my exercise add. Alison's cueing is right on, and she clearly explains what movements she is executing.  She does a great job talking through each segment considering the intensity of this workout. I was absolutely breathless.

You have the option to customize your workout. If you choose just one, the warm up is featured before every segment.  Here are the segments:

* 12-minute Kick-Butt Athletic Drills
* 12-minute Explosive Power Moves
* 12-minute Cardio Kickboxing
* 12-minute High-Intensity Moves

The warm up and cool down are about 4 minutes each.  The warm up definitely gets your body warm....I was ready to stop after the warm up ; ) The cool down has some nice stretching - incorporating some yoga.

I've done my best to break down each segment.  Alison adds onto the movements & repeats combos; I just am letting you know the basic movements in the combos.  A lot of the movements are quick!  Alison is good about giving a little time for recovery.

KICK-BUTT ATHLETIC DRILLS

Pick up weights
Step squat right and left, when stopping in middle - press weights overhead to work biceps and shoulders.
Tight Squat with basketball toss - feet together squat down, bring arms up while standing and press up to toes. Arms will be extended over head with palms facing out.

Weights down for football shuffle. Slow, then fast. Alison adds rotation to right & left to mix it up =)

Pick up weights

Put both weights in right hand. Tap right leg behind you while holding arm out in front of you. Next, tap leg back, bring knee up & pull elbow back. These movements are fast! Put both weights in left hand & repeat.
End with what this combo began with-dropping weights while shifting side to side.....

Put one weight down to do a wood chop. Holding weight with both hands at chest, begins with legs in staggered position bend knees, then stand and twist. Next continue the movement except extend the arm out like a lever.

MUCH NEEDED COOL DOWN!!

I highly recommend this workout if you have enjoyed any of the better Firm workouts (like Get Chisl'd). It is definately for intermediate level exercisers and up. It may be a little hard on the knees for those with knee problems, although with Emily's modifications there shouldn't be much of an issue.  Love it!! Please leave a comment if you have any questions!",1280016000,157,7587,4.425792507204611

4188139,5,B003SG8136,"Oh My!!! I really like this one. I usually do all 4 workouts in one setting. Can use them to add  1 or 2 segments to another workout also. As an example:Cardio Inferno, or Cardio Dance Slim Down, or FE Cycle 1 Ignite Cardio & a couple of segments on this workout & your workout for the day should be complete.",1457222400,,309,4.065573770491803

4188141,5,B003SG8136,"This is a no nonsense workout if combined. I felt strong and acconplished after this. My whole body was worked for a a total body strength and cardio workout clocking in at 53 minutes approximately. I usually use 8-15 lb dumbells for most of the firm workouts that i own but with this one, i stuck to 5 lb dumbells because of the constant cardio. Im an intermediate level home workout enthusiast just 12 weeks after having my second baby and this is going to make me lose the baby weight without a doubt. I would definitely encourage people to buy this and will probably gift this to friends. Im even going to try and get my husband to join me in this.",1455667200,3,652,4.308943089430894
4188142,5,B003SG8136,This is a fantastic workout. It lives up to its title. I really worked out a sweat with these exercises. I recommend this for those of you who prefer cardio along with sculpting.,1454889600,,178,4.424242424242424

4188148,3,B003SG8136,"I like the various workout options available on this DVD. I am a huge FIRM fan but am rating it a 3 instead Of 4 because every ""12 min"" segment starts with the same warm up. You have to fast forward every time if you do more than one at a time ( which I do). Warm up and cool down should be separate, in my opinion. But if you do several segments, good workout.",1439596800,2,361,3.8266666666666667
4188149,5,B003SG8136,"This is an incredible video. I received it as a gift right after my son was born 3 years ago, and whenever I need to drop a few pounds very quickly and/or tone up, this is the video I use. I love that you can mix and match five different choices. I have never gotten bored with the variety this offers - and with the quick results, you really cannot go wrong.",1438819200,,359,4.0
4188150,4,B003SG8136,"I have two of Jillian Michaels' DVDs which are great for circuit training and while tough, they are only 30 minutes long; I wanted to add another exercise DVD to my collection and chose this one based on the great reviews and length. I have been through this one 3 times now--all 56 minutes of it-- and it is a toughie--lots of plio jumps, lots of variety in moves...but almost too much variety.  By the time that you get a sequence down, she moves to the next one; agree with others that this is not a beginner DVD; you will be frustrated.  The Kick boxing segment is the easiest to follow in terms of cues and routine.  There is also very little floor work for general toning.  Even if you modify some of the jumping in each segment, you will still get a great workout, though.  Good DVD for the money.",1438214400,2,804,4.298013245033113
4188151,5,B003SG8136,"This workout is HARRRRRRRRD - you will burn ALL the calories! I had a hard time keeping up at points, but there is no doubt you get an amazing workout! I love the express option when short on time. I highly recommend this for people who are already in pretty good shape - I don't think beginners could keep up and may not even be able to do all of one 12-minute segment - it's very fast paced and pushes you, but what a great workout!!",1433894400,4,435,4.069767441860465
4188152,5,B003SG8136,"Extremely rigorous! Very easy to follow. The entire workout takes an hour, but it's worth it. Highly recommended. Allison is an instructor that is easy to follow, even during a strenuous workout.",1433548800,,195,5.125
4188153,5,B003SG8136,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,5,1486,4.427007299270073
4188154,4,B003SG8136,"While I like this dvd and the workouts are decent, if you are an advanced exerciser, these workouts will fall short of being as intense of a cardio workout as you probably need if you are looking for a high intensity day.  It's good for medium to lighter days, but I would definitely not call it hardcore, as it claims to be.  Also of note, these workouts are all each 16 minutes, not 12.  It's better than some, which is why I give it 4 stars and I will use it, but the not the best.  It did get my heart rate up briefly, but did not leave me breathless, which I expect to be on a hardcore, high intensity day.",1431216000,,611,4.024793388429752
4188155,5,B003SG8136,Very fast paced 12 minute intervals the modified version isn't very modified you can just don't move so face paced also watch the video before doing so you can get s couple of the advanced movement she does a standing / laying plank  that I had to watch a couple of times before I got it . Makes you really makes you sweat I mostly used 5 lbs weights it was difficult doing a lunge plus with 8 lbs,1430784000,,397,4.025316455696203

4188159,5,B003SG8136,"I had done the firm over 10 years ago, but in recent years have been doing dvds from Jillian Michaels and Beachbody. I just needed something different to fit into my routine this winter. This fits the bill and I would consider it to be intermediate to advanced level. I am an intermediate level and have only been able to do 3 consecutive of the workouts in a row, but should be able to do all 4 within the next week. The routines took a couple of times for me to master the sequences, but now this is what seems to make it go so fast. It ""dresses up"" some of the usual routines, and adds in some that I have not done before, so this will keep me coming back for more! The instructor provides good cueing.  Definitely going to incorporate it into my routine a couple of times a week, which is saying a lot because it seems to take a lot for me to find a home exercise dvd that doesn't bore me after a few times. Definitely left me dripping, and seemed to give me not only a great cardio workout, but also felt a lower body burn too. Once I became comfortable with the routine, I would skip the  introductory low impact portion of the power sequence and jump right into the hi-intensity portion to vamp it up a notch, since I sometimes felt like I wanted more reps of this.",1425513600,,1272,4.166666666666667

It's a calorie explosion for sure! I absolutely love that you can build your own workout out of 4 that they have, and you don't have to hustle and fast forward because it will automatically put one warm-up (in the beginning) and one cool-down (in the end) for you. Another note for anyone who is going to try - make sure you have smaller weights! I usually use 10 lbs, but  since cardio here is pretty intense (you literally have to twist and turn and jump with weights in your hand) I had to downgrade to 5 lbs (beginners might want to start with no weight at all and then go to 2lbs first). Overall, 5 stars. If you are a pro - you can always make a longer work-out with bigger weights, if you are a beginner you can make 24-minute sessions at first, and they WILL make you sweat.

Over the years, I havent't been too impressed with the systems they have come out with so I was hesitant to get this workout because I was afraid I wouldn't like the formatting. I am glad I gave it a try and got it. This workout is broken up in sections and the time just flies as you move from one section to the next. I was pourng sweat when I was done and I had a lot of fun doing it. The only thing that I did not like about this workout is that there is a section where you are doing explosive plyometric movements while doing upper body moves with weightswhich I think if an injury waiting to happen. If your weights are too heavy or if they swing just a little awkwardly I could see someone really hurting themselves. I personally did not follow these moves because hurting myself is not something that I want to do but I just did those moves a little faster and I feel like I got the same intensity.

It's challenging from start to finish - I workout for an hour 6 days a week and I was pouring sweat the entire time!  I would highly recommend this workout for anyone looking for a real calorie burn.  This workout consists of a 4 minute warm-up, 4 12 minute workouts combining weights, cardio and hard ""boosts"", and a 4 minute cooldown.  Emily does the modifications while Rebekah and Alison do the full versions and they all do a good job of performing the exercises, keeping you interested and getting you to push yourself.",1340582400,3,763,4.453237410071942

This dvd makes 500 Calorie Work Out and Boot Camp look like kindergarten! It is high intesity and you will find yourself out of breath and drenched in sweat once it is over.

One other thing to note is that even the lead instructor's (Allison Davis) body has never looked leaner.  Allison is my favorite instructor and has always been in excellent shape, however on this dvd she looks shredded and this work out is probably why.

I always do this particular one all the way through, though I am sure many people will appreciate the fact that it is divided in sections if you only want to focus on certain aspects during your workout. I have been using this dvd for a little over a month with 5lb weights and my legs and arms are so much firmer and leaner. I feel energized and proud of myself once I complete each work out, but I gotta tell you I am always glad when it is over and I realize I have made it through in once piece!!",1334880000,7,1101,4.135514018691588

It could be a great dvd. However, I just find some of the moves very awkward. Some of the combinations with weights seem unsafe because of the speed with which the women move on the DVD. I find that if I do the moves without the weights, I can get better form. Maybe as I get used to the movements I can add light weights. I wouldn't suggest going heavier than 5 lbs, because Allison moves very quickly. I don't really do this workout much because I fear being injured.",1333929600,3,645,4.295081967213115

I haven't made it all the way through all 4 segments in one sitting, but I've done 3 of them back to back and that was quite challenging.

I'm surprised at all the great review for this, there are WAY better choices out there to burn calories.  TaeBo is easier to follow with major calorie burn, and Jackie Warner has a no-crunch ab workout that's super easy to follow also and I'm having good results with both (but sadly this Firm workout will go in the donation bin).",1326240000,5,692,4.433070866141732

After this DVD, everything else--including running and P90x's plyometric workout--is just child's play.  It is tough, but not so overwhelmingly difficult that you work out to it once and then abandon it (this is the complaint that I have heard from people I know who own the Insanity workouts--those DVDs are now collecting dust).  On days you just do not want to do the entire 55 minute workout, you can choose do to any of the 4 12-minute segment workouts.

I would say I am at the intermediate level and couldn't get through the last workout at all. I skipped right to the stretch. This is nothing technical or dancey - just basic stuff with explosive add-ons. According to the FIRM, that's when you burn fat and I tend to believe them because I am down 20 pounds already from their workouts. An interesting thing, too, is that I've done p90x and a lot of the very same exercises here are on those DVDs, too. Personally I have always loved the FIRM and always get great results. The thing I love about this workout is that it will take me probably forever to ""master"" it so it will definitely be in my rotation of DVDs for a long time, so you definitely get your money's worth.",1315353600,3,892,4.247058823529412

4188251,5,B003SG8136,"I've been looking for workouts to do at home when it's too icy or snowy to run, and this one is great! It has 4 12-minute workout segments combining cardio and strength training (Kick-Butt Athletic Drills,
Explosive Power Moves, Cardio Kickboxing, High-Intensity Moves), plus 4-minute warmup and cooldown segments. You can combine the segments in whatever combination you want, to add variety and control the difficulty of the workout, and all 4 segments are good workouts.

I really like that the segments are modular, because on days when my motivation is low, it's easy to talk myself into just doing the warmup and ONE segment, which is only 15-16 minutes of exercise. Then once I've gotten into it, I have no problem continuing for the rest of the DVD!

The exercises are all easy to follow, without a lot of fancy footwork that (to me) decreases the exercise intensity since I'm concentrating so hard on intricate maneuvers. There are 2 backup instructors who demonstrate a more-intense and less-intense version, respectively, of each exercise, to help you modify the intensity to suit your level.

I'm in pretty good shape (I run, bike, lift, and do P90X and the Brazil Butt Lift series) and I found this workout to be just the right amount of challenge -- my HR stays between 160 and 180 bpm, and I'm always sweaty after a few minutes and tired at the end, with just the right amount of muscle soreness the next day (telling me I had a good workout without overdoing it). I highly recommend this video!",1299283200,4,1510,4.755725190839694
4188252,5,B003SG8136,I just wanted to say this is a great dvd. It also has a free one year subscription to Fitness mag. You are given the option of taking the magazine or getting the money refunded to you for the mag. It does state that August is when the magazine offer expires. 6.21 value. So after all this is a good buy.,1299110400,,303,3.9836065573770494
4188253,5,B003SG8136,"Another good one from The Firm.  This is not a work-out for a beginner, that's for sure.  Having done this a few times now, I consider this one a goal to be able to make it all the way through without having to pause.  This work-out is fast paced and keeps the heart rate up the whole time.  I look forward to reaching my goal with this one.",1297641600,,341,3.9705882352941178

I adore Alison, she is easy to follow and seems like someone you would really like to workout with. I typically do some weight training (or kettlebell) before, then move into one of the four. The steps were a little hard for me to learn at first, I lack grace, but now I feel like a pro. Love it!! Just brought a ton more DVD's lead by Alison because I love this one so much. The Firm is my favorite program!!",1296691200,2,500,3.9603960396039604

This is a great workout for people who are already in good shape and workout regularly - it will really get your heart pumping.  In fact, I recommend using a heart-rate monitor with this workout so you can keep it in the safe-for-you zone.  I am a dedicated Firm fan and this workout kicked my butt - I didn't feel too bad though because the instructors are sweating and breathless too!",1294358400,3,554,4.392156862745098
4188256,5,B003SG8136,"I have been working out with The FIRM workouts since 1994--consistantly. I also alternate with Cathe Freidrichs due to the newer FIRMS were starting to become shorter, and less challanging..although all of the newer ones are nice, but for advance excercisers like me, this workout seems to be finally....a CHALLANGE!! Woohoo! lol

First of all, it isn't TOO hard tho, but challanging enough. The moves were very easy to follow. However, I noticed that using more then 5 or 7 lbs in the weight segments is not such a good idea (even tho I could use higher lbs), there are some parts of the workout where they use the dumbells slow..then really fast...so do not use more then 5lbs (or could cause an injury). I mainly use this as a cardio workout (even if it has some slight toning in it), because again, they do not use the weights enough for it to be a solid ""strentgh training"" workout. Don't get me wrong tho..you will get toned with this one. :) I just meant that because they reps are fast, and used a little bit, they weights are more of a toning, and to boost calorie burning during cardio. :)

Now, this workout did seem to fly by, her cueing I thought was very good (always loved Alison anyways in all her videos). :) The music was ok, but didn't mind since the workout was fun enough to not even notice. ;)

What I loved most about this workout, was that it was more high impact, and LONGER..since most of the newer ""Pink FIRMS"" seemed not long enough (except 500 Calorie workout--which I also love). This one is very very good. :)

My ONLY complaint was that there was no solid ""ab"" sections..although some workouts in this video does work your abs...I still always feel that if there isn't a ab-only section in a workout, I still feel my abs were not ""complete."" lol...maybe I missed a section? Anyhow, no problem, because I just then simply use a different workout DVD and do that ab section. But it would be nice to have a good solid ab workout at the end.

Other then that--GREAT workout, fun, LONG, but NO Dread factor...just be SURE to not heavy up with dumbells--again because she swings them with really fast fast reps in some parts..so just when you ""think"" you can use your 10 or 12lbs in this one---do think again...because swinging them fast can be dangerous. Again, she doesn't swing them in a bad way..but use light weights and you WILL still feel the ""burn""..the next day..like I am right now. LOL",1293667200,5,2422,4.507972665148063
4188257,4,B003SG8136,I bought this on the strength of its reviews by others. We have most of Jillian Michaels' DVDs and some of Jackie Warner's which we rate as our bench mark when we are unable to get to our local gym classes. However it is good to get variation. I've not used it but my wife has. She is quite critical of fitness programs as she has dyspraxia and so the regimes that have complicated choreography do not work for her. However my wife liked this one and it made her sweat. However it probably is not quite as strenuous as Jillian or Jackie's workouts or of Bob Harper's latest offerings (Inside out)which are for butcher's dogs. If you are new to fitness this is probably a good introduction.,1292112000,3,689,4.390625
4188258,4,B003SG8136,"This is a fast moving DVD so you better not be a beginner when it comes to exercise. You have to be coordinated and in shape! You need space to work out too. I liked it and definitely got a good workout but prefer the Jillian Michales approach better like in her DVD ""No more Trouble Zones.""",1291075200,,291,4.12280701754386
4188259,4,B003SG8136,"Although I tend to do Cathe,Jari, Jillian and now even Bob's dvds, I opted to try this after previewing at collage videos. It is great for short days and then on cardio days do the entire workout for a perfect workout under 60mins. Based on my HRM the calorie burn is also great. Allison is a good instructor and with the combos of plyo, atletic drills, some kickboxing and weight exercises, I usually will feel some soreness the day after especially in the glute area. What lady does not want to improve on that area? For the price this dvd is well worth it and although similar to Michelle Dozois pk dvd it has less of a dread factor.",1290470400,,636,4.352941176470588
4188260,1,B003SG8136,"I did not like this video. I ordered it because of the 5 star ratings.  There was a lot of building on other moves, it was too complicated to follow, I was always WAY behind the instructor and left me very discouraged. I wasted more energy trying to get back on track than getting a workout in.  I did break a sweat but it wasn't a relaxing enjoyable sweat.  There was also quite a bit of jumping which is horrible for my knees.  I was hoping to see some floor work with toning exercises but no such luck.  I would not recommend. I've used better videos.",1289692800,13,554,4.188679245283019
4188261,5,B003SG8136,"I love this workout. I own many FIRM videos and this is my new favorite. I alternate between 5lb and 8lb weights depending on the move. I wore my heart rate monitor while doing it and my heart rate stayed in the 160's for most of the workout - estimated that I burned about 500 calories! Not bad for 55 minute video. I won't go into details about the moves because another reviewer did that already. But I like Alison as an instructor although she has been known for occasionally mis-cueing. At this point, I'd say I'm an advanced exerciser when it come to FIRM workouts and I am still sore after doing this workout 3 days ago. It is definitely being put into my weekly routine.

I would not recommend this one for beginners. I think intermediates should start with low weight until you do it a few times and know what weight will work best.

If you like this one, I also recommend Get Chisel'd and the 500 Calorie Workout.",1289174400,2,923,4.3604651162790695

I like that it can be customized to change the length of the workout -- doing one segment with warm up and cool down would take about 18 minutes and doing all 4 12 minute segments makes it about an hour long workout.",1288224000,2,385,4.1891891891891895
4188263,5,B003SG8136,"I am a 24 year old long time exerciser who grew up doing my mom's 'Firm' tapes.  I used the transfirmer series to get back into shape after both my babies.  Though lately the video's they have come out with have been gimicky and just weren't challenging at all.  So I moved on to Jari Love, Amy Bento, and Insanity.  I saw this DVD in target and decided to give it a try, after reading all the good reviews.
I love it!  It isn't as super challenging as insanity, but you don't always want a brutal workout.  It is fun, quick paced, and defnitely challenging even to advanced exercisers.
I hope the Firm comes out with more workouts like this!  I would definitely buy more if they continue to make workouts this challenging.",1288224000,12,723,4.390977443609023
4188264,5,B003SG8136,Excellent workout if you are short on time and need some intense training.  There are 4; 20 minute routines but each routine has the same start and cool down. On the menu you can combine as much workouts as you would like or switch between workouts.  The instrutor has very good cuing and guidance and there is a person that shows the workout at a lower intensity.  This is really a good buy!,1287360000,3,392,4.342465753424658
4188265,5,B003SG8136,"I am a huge Firm fan who has tried several of their cardio DVDs.  This is the best one I've done in awhile!!  It's definitely challenging - I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser and each time I've done this workout (3 times now) I've walked away DRIPPING with sweat.  It's fabulous!  Allison's cueing is awesome and she's not as repetitive in this workout as she's tended to be in other videos (I love her....but she does make you do the same moves over and over and over....).  This workout uses light weights occasionally, but they're really more for the purpose of upping the intensity of the cardio, so I would recommend doing this one on days where you're aiming for just cardio and save the weight training for another day.  Be advised though - I'd put this on the same level as The 500 Calorie Workout (Kelsie Daniels)- different moves, less work with the weights, but just as challenging in its own way.",1286841600,13,913,4.604938271604938

When I started from the warm up it seemed pretty easy but the pace of the workout catches up with you and you can easily burn 500+ calories performing this workout.  Plenty of plank style workouts with pushups, jumps, tuck jumps, jumping jacks, various lunges, and a kickboxing routine.
