These show you come great cooks out there that don't have star status, but maybe should!",1395619200,2,257,4.468085106382978
8332206,5,B001P6J0ZE,"Bobby Flay is one of the classiest fun and entertaining chefs. Not only is he great at cooking but he is a wonderful competetor. Here's a chef that will go up against any type of cooking greats. There are so many great dishes that people all over create. And in walks Bobby to issue a ""Throwdown"" that he can not only compete but make a better version of their dish.

This set is great for people to see Bobby compete while reading his new book ""Throwdown"", please send us more Throwdowns, as I'm hungry for more..So in Bobby's words ""Are you ready for (more) Throwdowns?""
Because I know I am.",1288742400,3,593,4.390909090909091
8332207,5,B001P6J0ZE,"Bobby Flay is my ultimate chef to watch. He's  not only a superb iron chef and a culinary wizard but hes got loads of 'class' and 'moxie'. Throwdown' is probably my favourite show and its great to see the recipe challenges he takes on. You can re-make the recipes by watching or going to the foodnetwork site.....and now a 'Throwdown' cookbook is coming out...awesome
This dvd brings you into the everyday world' as Bobby and his two wonderful sidekicks head out on the road to surprise their 'chefs'. I wish more episodes were on this, cause I love each episode..but..hey.. there are 3 dvd's with bonus material.....when I want to relax and have fun I just watch one of these dvd's and get cooking tips as well. A special nod to Miriam and Stephanie who add a wonderful feminine and fun touch to the show, [as  well as some great humour and culinary advice to Bobby] as they often 'tease' Bobby and vice versa.....cant wait for another 'THROWDOWN' dvd set to come out. Thankyou Bobby for all the joy and help you've given in your culinary profession...you're no. 1",1287014400,2,1065,4.62962962962963
