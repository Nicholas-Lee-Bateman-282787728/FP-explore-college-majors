This particular video was one of my recent purchases for him.  Luna is one of my favorite characters in the show; she has such a beautiful voice and a reassuring presence, and Ray the sun, who is also featured in this video, is very likable as well.  The whole video is great (although I agree with those who say there are too many previews at the beginning!).",992563200,2,493,4.384615384615385

I bought this DVD because I wanted to encourage him with tooth brushing and bed habits with a fun video.  And, it took Bear and all of his friends...what seemed to be an hour of video...to get to bed!  I was bored to tears.  My toddler didn't last very long at all.  The bed habits, which seemed more like ""how much can I stall before I go to bed"" or procrastinate, were not exactly what I wanted my son to learn.  I just did not like this video at all.  Sorry.
We also bought the Bear Dance Party Video. My son DOES like that one. To each their own, I guess!",1230595200,,659,3.984732824427481
1391561,5,B000053V5Z,"Criteria for a children's video:

1. Do kids like it? Yes, my toddler loves this, sings along, and asks me to sing along, too.

2.  Can the parents watch it without going bonkers?  Yep, so far, so good, every time I see it again I notice new things.  The puppets are sophisticated and the characters distinct. The music is fabulous, mostly inspired by modern American folk--how great to hear simple fiddle music and guitar instead of overproduced ""showtunes."" The simple music also means that if I sing the songs afterward, it sounds close to what my child remembers from the show.

3. Since kids will copy anything they see on TV or in a book, what is going on in this video?  Gentle humor, good manners, good music. All things I'm glad to see her emulate.

That's the bare bones (ha!) of liking this series.  But it goes beyond the basic.  __Bear__ has subtle messages about food, getting along, and social differences.  For instance, in one episode, Tutter the mouse is eating a sandwich, which he must learn to share. OK, we could see that coming. BUT! Without making a big deal over, it, the producers made the sandwich on whole wheat bread, quietly supporting good nutrition.

Another example or two; when Ojo the bear cub sleeps over, Bear makes her bed, very cozy, on the couch. When they have a birthday party (in a different episode), it's home made decorations and one meaningful present. A quiet message that you don't have to have a great deal of money to have a good time.

And there are significant female characters (Ojo, Shadow, Luna) who aren't made into gooey subservients as in so many kids videos (or feature films, for that matter).

Bear is the leader of the series, but often sings harmony to some other character, giving a simple message that you don't always have to be number one.

Hooray for Bear!",1177718400,3,1825,4.624223602484472
1391562,4,B000053V5Z,"As always bear keeps kids busy and teaches them at the same time. This one is excellent to help get them ready for bed too. Bear is great, he teaches about  import things such as brushing teach, combing hair, potty training, the seasons, colors, to share, doctor office visiting, among many other things. The best pre-school has to offer.",1173139200,,338,4.728813559322034
1391563,4,B000053V5Z,"""Early to Bed, Early to Rise"" is another in a series of ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" video releases ported to DVD. This DVD includes two episodes from the video release ---  ""Go to Sleep"" and ""Morning Glory"" and adds in ""A Winter's Nap.""

""Go to Sleep""

Ojo stays over for the night at the Big Blue House. Bear helps her to get to sleep and then decides to turn in himself, when the doorbell rings. It turns out that his friends Jeremiah and Doc Hog have shown up for a card game, which Bear completely forgot about. Now Bear has to take care of them, while also seeing that Ojo isn't disturbed, as well as Tutter, who's sleeping in his mousehole. Featuring a great song from Shadow, ""Rockabye,"" about how shadows watch over you at night.

""Morning Glory""

Bear helps everybody in the Big Blue House to get up in the morning after a sleepover, but some have more trouble rising than others. Once everybody is up, though, they're ready and raring for morning activities --- but not before enjoying a nice breakfast. Treelo just wants to play, play, play, but Bear and everyone else manage to convince him that it would be better to have some breakfast first. Featuring an old-favorite ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" song --- ""Brush Brush Bree.""

""A Winter's Nap""

Winter has come to Woodland Valley and Bear would like nothing more than a nice nap. However, he never quite seems to make it to the nap, as he has to help out his friends in the Big Blue House. Sleep evades Bear, but his friends have a nice surprise for him.

Like all of the other ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" DVDs, there aren't really any good special features on this. You only get the option to jump to songs from the episodes and previews for other Disney TV Shows and movies.",1128124800,12,1743,4.391304347826087
1391564,5,B000053V5Z,"This is another excellent DVD in the ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" series.  It has episodes concerning: going to sleep, ""Go to Sleep"";  starting a brand new day, ""Morning Glory""; and napping, ""A Winter's Nap"".

""Go to Sleep"" covers ways to lull yourself off to dreamland, even though you may not think you're tired, and the importance of a good night's sleep for a good day tomorrow.

""Morning Glory introduces Ray, the sun, who sings a good morning song with Bear.  The episode incorporates the importance of breakfast, brushing your teeth, how different people take different amounts of time to wake up, getting morning chores done and how having a good morning can influence the rest of your day.

The message on the ""A Winter's Nap"" episode is a little strange, however.  The episode is supposed to be about Bear and Tutter, the mouse, trying to take naps during the day, but neither one can seem to manage it due to various things going on in the house.  In the end they both throw in the towel and join in the fun in a ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" mentality.  While the rest of the episode talks about naps and how to get cozy and fall asleep, how good they are for you, etc., I really didn't understand the ""Oh, well, can't nap? No big deal"" message that came out near the end.  Other than that though, it was a cute episode.

The character Shadow, whose segments I usually find a little creepy, is more down to earth in these and there are less of the cut-out shadow people scenes and more of Shadow just singing songs.",1125964800,7,1531,4.432142857142857
1391565,5,B000053V5Z,"OK, call me selfish, but when looking for a DVD for my son to watch, I am hoping to find something that I can watch over and over again without going crazy.  This is it.  I love the bear, the big blue house, and all of his friends (coincidentally, so does my son).  This one has great messages for kids about bedtime even when you don't want to sleep, the importance of breakfast, cleaning the house, and naptime!",1124841600,2,413,4.269230769230769
1391566,5,B000053V5Z,"Of all the shows on video, these two shows on this tape are by far the best.  The music is phenomenal, and storylines carry a positive, important message.  My son now LOVES anything that looks like the sun (Ray, in the show), and already loved the moon (Luna) from other shows.

7930301,5,B000053V5Z,"We love this Bear in the Big Blue House dvd, since we like anything that portrays bedtime in a positive light! The songs are great, the characters are funny, and the show as a whole is much more soothing than the wild cartoons all over tv most of the time! We are VERY strict about bedtimes and sleep routines and my daughter is super stubborn, this is a great persuasive tool. Bear is non-preachy about the importance of healthy sleep habits and routine, also having a good breakfast in the morning. Kids are more likely to accept this information from a fun and friendly bear than from parents.

We love the songs, especially the Good Morning song and the Goodbye song. Ray and Luna are my favorites. The song that Shadow sings in the first episode ""Go to Sleep"" is very sweet. Usually my daughter is freaked out by Shadow and I have to fast forward past those segments but this one she does like.

We also have Tidy Time, Potty Time, and Everyone is Special. They are all great and I recommend trying them out. If you aren't sure, check your library first!",1421366400,,1059,4.453608247422681
