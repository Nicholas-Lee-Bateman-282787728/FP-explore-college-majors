8344523,5,B001UNSZVW,"This DVD of a stage play really makes you feel you have bought tickets to a Broadway play. If you have a general idea of the TRUE story documented in the book ""Walden"", this play will leave you laughing out loud every minute of the show. The humor that pervades the script is BRILLIANT, albeit somewhat scholarly. Produced by college students for their peers, but with much more widespread appeal.

8344524,4,B001UNSZVW,"As folksinger/playwright Michael Johnathon explains in his introduction to his play, almost everyone has at least heard of Thoreau, and probably know one or two of his most famous quotes. But in this fast-paced age of short attention spans & countless digital distractions, coming to a rich, thoughtful work like ""Walden"" could may prove daunting for many readers. especially younger ones. So how is it best done?

This short play is a charming introduction to both the man & his thought. Without dumbing down anything, author Johnathon has written of Thoreau's final two days in his cabin at Walden, before he left to return to the world of everyday human life. It's surprisingly humorous, verging on warm-hearted comedy at first ... but this is a wise move on the author's part, as it makes the literary giants Thoreau & Emerson into flesh-&-blood human beings, rather than stiff, remote figures solemnly intoning Wise Wisdoms To The Ages.

And once the viewer has accepted these characters as people not unlike themselves, with similar foibles & uncertainties & hopes, the rest of the play explores Thoreau's approach to the world, with its emphasis on simplicity, reflection, and love of Nature. It's amazing how much of this speaks directly to the present day -- more so when we're informed by the author afterwards that the majority of the dialogue is taken from actual quotes by Thoreau & Emerson themselves.

The package as a whole is a lovely design. It includes a second disc of songs inspired by Thoreau, a 24-page study guide for students & teachers, and several extras on the DVD itself: the making of the play, an interview with a Thoreau scholar, and so on. All in all, you couldn't ask for a better way of opening the eyes & minds of the curious to the vision of one of our best & most enduring literary lights -- not just as an historic figure, but as a living presence whose worldview is even more urgent today -- recommended!",1393891200,4,1944,4.779761904761905
8344525,5,B001UNSZVW,"I really enjoyed this documentary/play! Without focusing too much on Thoreau's personal philosophy, which I obviously adore or I likely wouldn't be writing this review, I'll run through the film itself.

I can't comment on any special features that may or may not be on the DVD, because I watched it at a friend's house, and we didn't explore the disc. BUT, the film itself is certainly enjoyable. It starts out with a Thoreau historian who seems to have a genuine appreciation for Thoreau and his philosophy. He then gives us a bit of history about Thoreau, and his life before his 2 years on Walden pond.

Next, it shifts to a filming of an exhibition of the play itself. I really enjoyed this bit. The actors were all quite talented, and I think they were all a good fit for their respective roles. The man that was picked to play Ralph Waldo Emerson was probably the best fit of the entire cast, in my respectful opinion. It was a real treat to see two of my idols on screen (and stage) together. Very cool.

At the end, like a well written essay, there is a bit of a conclusion from the previously mentioned historian, and the film ends fittingly enough.

I think Thoreau would be well pleased with this production.",1297296000,5,1220,4.506787330316742
