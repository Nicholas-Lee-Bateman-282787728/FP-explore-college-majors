1993622,5,B0001E6CKW,"I haven't seen this film in it's entirety, but just the TV spots advertising the movie over 20 years ago deserve five stars. Just seeing stills from this film gives me the chills.",1119484800,2,179,4.454545454545454
1993623,5,B0001E6CKW,"I agree with you all, and feel that this is my all-time favorite slasher film, and possibly the most underrated horror movie in recent memory. There is just something about the scenery, setting, characters, and everything else about this film that was a truly enjoyable wonder of 80's horror to behold. Given the background of this film, its something of a small miracle that ""Curtains"" was ever made.

What we have here is a movie about a play involving a character named ""Audra"" that was to be portrayed by the wonderful Samantha Sherwood (played to the hilt by the charming Samantha Eggar of ""The Brood"" fame). Audra was supposed to be a lunatic, and for Sherwood to get the part right, she and her director Jonathon Stryker (played by the intense John Vernon, of ""Animal House"")decide that the best way for Sherwood to prepare for the part is to get herself committed to a real mental hospital. Unfortunately for Sherwood, this was the opportunity that her director was looking for, when he decides to leave her to rot there, and cast for the part at his villa in the country for 6 other actresses. Once Sherwood finds out of this, she escapes, and heads for Stryker. No sooner does she get out, the other 6 actresses begin to get bumped off in a relatively bloodless and effective manner by a witch-masked killer that had me trembling.

The film then switches over to the ""10 Little Indians"" mode as we try to find out who the killer is.

The film was marred by setback after setback, even having its director Richard Ciupka (""Atlantic City"")walk out on the film half way through the film. The film was then completed by the producer who used the pseudonym ""Jonathon Stryker"" in the credits. But through it all ""Curtains"" has the lush scenery, great atmosphere, and the claustrophobic winter setting to send chills up and down your spine like a blast of Missisauga air. I too cannot wait for this film to be released onto DVD, since it is a must have for anyone interested in the slasher film genre, or something that was a great tribute to these abundant films of the 1980's. ""Curtains"" was special to me because it gave what it promised to deliver: Scares. The killer was truly frightening, and this film did it all while breaking some of the rules of the modern slasher/horror film. We have a killing in broad daylight which was awesomely effective, a film that was mostly adults, and a scary little doll that seemed to have death follow close behind it. Great acting put this film over the top as well, with great scenes from Vernon, Eggar, and Lynne Griffin (""Patti O'Connor"" in Curtains, and also starred in Strange Brew). Also take a peek for a young Michael Wincott of ""The Crow"", and ""Strange Days"" as a doomed Matthew.

 Truly another great slasher brought to us by Simcom Productions, who gave us the famed ""Prom Night"". Great, great slasher film well worth the search and the view.

1993624,5,B0001E6CKW,I love this movie. Jeez when will it be on DVD!! All the actors are great. I loved the ending chase with Sandra Warren(Terror Train as Sandee Currie) It was like 10 minutes long. And when the killer is revealed. I never thought it would be her. I thought she was gonna be the only one to live and not be a killer.,1087516800,,313,3.984126984126984

This is a true classic that needs to be released on DVD, with any extras that may be available.  There is a scene in here, where the masked killer is skating toward the camera with a sickle in their hand.....brrrr, I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it!  If you are a fan of whodunnit horror films, you've seen this.  If not.....it is highly recommended viewing if you like a good mystery with horror thrown in.

1993650,4,B0001E6CKW,I don't know why this movie didn't get the attention that other 80s slashers got. It's just as good if not better than most in my opinion. A handful of actresses get taken out by a killer wearing one of the creepiest masks you'll ever see!  Definitely  worth buying.,1458000000,,266,4.408163265306122
1993651,5,B0001E6CKW,A great 80's slasher film. However not your typical slasher film. This movie gave me nightmares when I was younger. And it still gives me the creeps. Awesome mask used by the killer.,1457740800,2,182,4.545454545454546

1993653,1,B0001E6CKW,All I gotta say is laughable terrible acting and this movie was laughable 80s movies are always terrible and this shows it even more this is like homemade filming with terrible actors and the chasing with the mask while a girl is skating......terribly filmed the screaming sounded laughable the only great thing was when it was over that was the best part,1456531200,,355,4.741935483870968
1993654,5,B0001E6CKW,Fantastic old movie. I had no idea this existed till I watched it only a year or so ago and I am a huge classic horror fan. This has got to be in every collectors DVD tower. I think one day this movie will be hard to come by. There didn't seem to be many available on Amazon. Get it while the getting is good.  This movie has a surprising ending too.

1993655,4,B0001E6CKW,"CURTAINS opens w/ famous actress, Samantha Sherwood (Samantha Eggar-  THE COLLECTOR, THE BROOD, DEMONOID) having herself committed to a mental institution. She's there to do research for the lead role in AUDRA, the latest thriller by Director, Jonathan Stryker (John Vernon- THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES, ANIMAL HOUSE, KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE). While there, Samantha soon finds herself being affected far more seriously than she bargained for. Next, w/ Samantha seemingly out of the running, six actresses are all about to audition for the AUDRA role. That is, if they can live long enough to get the chance! It turns out that someone, wearing an old hag mask, is utilizing various sharp instruments to knock off these young actresses before their first reading! As if the homicidal hag weren't enough, there's a creepy doll turning up everywhere, as well! Although Vernon and Eggar are extremely over-qualified for their roles, they do add credibility to the proceedings. CURTAINS is an odd, entertaining slasher film from 1983. It contains several memorable sequences, such as the murderer-on-ice-skates, head-in-the-toilet, and backstage-chase. Unfortunately, the ""shock"" finale is rather abrupt. Still, a farcical, entertaining movie for lovers of the genre...",1452297600,3,1265,5.520618556701031
1993656,4,B0001E6CKW,"This seems to be a somewhat obscure 80s slasher film as even when released few people knew about it let alone saw it. Thanks to the folks at Synapse its now readily available to watch. Basic premise is a bunch of actresses are in a house to audition for a role & 1 by 1 they start getting picked up by a masked killer. There isn't much blood or gore in this one for those that may be expecting it. Its an enjoyable slasher for sure & one I really liked was the misdirection. The whole time the film makes it seem like a certain person is the killer only for it to be someone unexpected, which I really enjoyed. Ive seen so many films of this type I can usually guess whos the killer but this time I was way off. Recommended for fans of 80s slashers & horror film. Special features included are the trailer, a making of & a documentary short with behind the scenes footage from Curtains.",1444694400,,886,4.187134502923977
1993657,1,B0001E6CKW,"What a BORING movie. How on earth was this movie able to get so many positive ratings? It was the reason why I was prompted to purchase it in the first place. I'm sorry but this was the worst ""horror"" movie I have ever seen in my entire life.",1434844800,2,242,3.9591836734693877
1993658,3,B0001E6CKW,"Curtains is above average for a slasher film, though it ultimately doesnt seem to make a lot of sense. It does have a lot going for it: spirited acting by a solid cast, a strong sense of atmosphere and suspense, and some great scenes. The scene on the icy pond is a slasher classic.  Curtains didn't get a wide release in theaters or on home video, but its a cult classic. It looks great on Blu-Ray though and includes several supplements with surviving cast/crew interviews that shine the spotlight on the behind-the-scenes issues. Its back story is as interesting as what is seen on screen. If you like slasher films that are a cut above the rest (sorry for the pun), check out Curtains.",1433635200,4,689,4.556451612903226

1993664,2,B0001E6CKW,"I usually don't feel the need to write negative reviews, but I just had to say something about this one.
""Curtains"" is a relatively unknown slasher-type movie from 1983 about wannabe actresses who are sent to a remote location in the snow to ""audition"" for a major part in an upcoming movie. Unfortunately for them, a masked stalker is lurking around, ready to pick them off one by one. Now, I absolutely love a good scary movie, especially the ""whodunnit"" kind, and this had all the makings of a really good one. A creepy mansion in a dreary winter setting, a killer wearing a grotesque old-hag mask ( very cool by the way), and even a creepy doll thrown in the mix.  That, combined with all the positive reviews I read, I couldn't believe I had never even heard of this movie before.
But after watching it, I just felt like it had such potential and yet, kind of went nowhere. I spent most of the time waiting for something exciting to happen and with the exception of a few well-done scenes, nothing ever really did. As a matter of fact, some scenes made no sense to me at all and should have been left out completely! Even the big ""reveal"" at the end, seemed rushed and kind of fell flat. Now I can understand maybe why I had never heard of it before. Disappointing because I thought I had discovered a little gem!  On a positive note though, as other reviewers have mentioned, the ice-skating scene is pretty awesome and definitely the best part of the movie.",1423872000,2,1464,4.458955223880597

1993685,4,B0001E6CKW,"A ridiculously bad horror film that really tries hard and fails utterly. The plot trips up all over itself, the dialog is filled with contrived wit, and the actors are trying to push out that last bit of intensity and so all come off slightly forced. If you think 'thespians' are ridiculous, the movie is actually a pretty good 'theater farce'.

To comprehend what's going on, it's useful to keep in mind that them movie was shot in two different parts, using two different scripts with different goals, and what you're seeing is interleaved from these two different versions of the movie. It's not so different that the movie makes no sense, and instead it's funny to wonder why the doll keeps popping up randomly, what's the connection with the masked killer, etc.",1416182400,,766,4.7593984962406015

1993694,3,B0001E6CKW,"As far as slasher films go, this movie is just OKAY! The acting overall is pretty impressive. Some of the cinematography and sets are impressive! I thought that the plot had some potholes in it. The hag mask is nice! The ending of this movie which takes place in a movie prop room was very impressive and had great atmosphere! Overall, however, I've seen better films than this one!
The production took a few years to complete and the backstory is actually more interesting than the completed film!
If you happen to purchase the Blu Ray or DVD, watch the extra features...including the making of!
If you're a slasher completist, you may want to check it out...but don't expect too much from it!
the fact that this film has a sort of 'cult' following is surprising to me!",1415318400,,770,4.586956521739131

1993697,5,B0001E6CKW,"While CURTAINS may never gain the notoriety of a HALLOWEEN or FRIDAY THE 13th, it's miles above the other cookie-cutter slashers of its time. The plot revolves around a casting call for the coveted film role of ""Audra"" in which six actresses are assembled to compete for the part at a grand mansion in the dead of winter. One by one they are eliminated but just who is doing the slicing and dicing?

Production problems in the middle of the shoot delayed filming and the movie took nearly two years to be completed, so parts of it do feel a little disjointed, but what's here is still a fun ride. The ice rink scene is one the best stalking scenes ever and rivals anything else from the slasher boom. Samantha Eggar lends an air of class to the whole thing and Lynne Griffin is a delight as the wise-cracking stand-up-comedienne. And that hag mask far surpasses Jason Voorhees' hockey mask or Leatherface as one of cinema's creepiest visages.

The film also has a special place in my heart since it was filmed not far from here in Muskoka, ON and a minor Burton Cummings hit ""You Saved My Soul"" can be heard several times on the soundtrack. The print looks absolutely fantastic! Synapse Films have outdone themselves here and there is a lengthy interview with the directors, Lynne Griffin and Lesleh Donaldson that gives insight into the troubled shoot.

Toss your bootlegs and order this now!",1411257600,2,1393,4.654471544715447

1993700,5,B0001E6CKW,"Finally, a good quality print of this often overlooking Canadian classic! I've been wanting to check this film out for years, but the lesser quality horror movie collection DVDs this film has been featured on has always stayed my hand. Not so anymore. Loved the movie and Synapse Films did an astounding job with the restoration. I didn't mind the release delay because I knew Synapse was striving to put out the best version of this film that they could. And they didn't disappoint!

While some of the characters are a bit uninspired, that's almost to be expected in an '80s slasher. Seeing John Vernon is always a delight, even when he's playing a character like the one he's portraying here. Samantha Eggar was great too. As for the killer, a simple old hag mask and a sickle are enough to put the character right up there with Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees in terms of creep factor. And that ending!

If you're a fan of '80s horror, I strongly recommend checking out this flick. Well worth it. If you don't believe me, just look up the ice-skating scene. That scene alone is worth the price of admission.",1410480000,,1111,4.606060606060606

1993702,4,B0001E6CKW,"I have to admit that I cheated. When I found out that Synapse was going to be doing a DVD of this movie and I saw the promotions and the trailer I couldn't wait. I went out and found a four DVD pack that had ""Curtains"" as one of its films. I did enjoy the movie, but was kind of disappointed in the full frame feature, and the general drabness of the picture. It just goes to show you what a little love and care can do for a film. The synapse version of the movie is engrossing and brilliant in its anamorphic widescreen transfer. Be prepared to have fun.

Audra is a screenplay about a woman who is confined to a mental institution. This screenplay is bought by Samantha (Samantha Eggar) as a gift for her director Jonathan Stryker (played by John Vernon. Is it only me, or does Vernon seem to be suitable only for scummy roles?). Samantha assumes the title role of Audra is hers, even going so far as to have herself voluntarily committed to an insane asylum to better learn the role of the title character. Jonathan though, seems to have other ideas as he leaves Samantha in the asylum, and has six actresses invited to his mountain home for the weekend to audition for the role of Audra. Things are made more complex when a friend of Samantha's helps her escape from the asylum, and she shows up at the home unannounced to regain the role she had fought so hard for in the first place. Someone then starts killing off the actresses one by one, presumably to have the role to themselves. But who is it, and what is their true motive?

Shot in 1980 (and going through massive re-shoots and edits, and not released until 1983), Curtains is more than just typical slasher fare. There is quite a lot of character development, and some very classy camera work going on throughout the film. Although I was reminded of quite a few other films while watching this one (House on Haunted Hill, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Friday The 13th, Ten Little Indians), it still works on it's own merits and has some genuinely creepy moments sprinkled in with one or two truly iconic scenes for fans of horror cinema. The stalk and slash formula does creep into the film later on, but even that is handled well because of the strange setting, and neon bright colors used throughout this portion of the film (reminding me of Argento for a few, brief moments).

Synapse films presents Curtains on DVD and Blu-Ray in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, and is anamorphic widescreen. You have your choice of the original 2.0 mono, or Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. This is a brand new 2K high-definition transfer from original vault materials. Special features include The Ultimate Nightmare-an all new 30 minute 2014 retrospective including interviews with director Richard Ciupka, stars Lesleh Donaldson & Lynne Griffin, Editor Michael MacLaverty, special make up effects creator Grag Cannom, and composer Paul Zaza. Audio commentary track featuring Lesleh Donaldson and Lynne Griffin. Alternate audio track vintage interviews with producer Peter R. Simpson and star Samantha Eggar. Original theatrical trailer. Synapse has seemingly exhausted all avenues in bringing us the definitive version of Curtains to the home theater market. Be wise and find a copy today.",1410134400,,3241,4.732743362831858
1993703,1,B0001E6CKW,"O.k., I know people will say very, very bad things about me, but I have to give this movie the worst rating possible. I debated long and hard as to whether or not this was indeed the WORST horror movie I've ever seen, and you know what? It is. The biggest reason why I give it that dubious is because this SHOULD have been a very, very good movie. Lot's of talent behind it, but total and utter waste of time. My number one complaint is the writing/editing. I mean you are literally watching some scene and BAM! All of a sudden you're watching another scene without ANY explanation or seeming relation to what was just on. And trust me when I tell you that this ambiguity was NOT a clever attempt at keeping the story fresh. I have never sat at a movie and actually said, out loud, I really don't know what is going on here. Until ""Curtains"". Again, some good ideas, some really good talent, but direction and writing make this film so dreadful (and not in a good way) that I am very, VERY sorry I bought this film at all. As for the technical merits of this Bluray transfer, I will say it is very good, not breathtaking, but looks very good. The sound is adequate, though not especially well mixed. But, then again, with a story this atrocious, who cares about what anyone is saying???",1409702400,8,1286,4.340248962655601
1993705,4,B0001E6CKW,"Those familiar with Synapse Films, know this is as good as it gets when it comes to blu ray transfers. Don May, head honcho over at Synapse is one dedicated dude. The true marvel for collectors, is that this flick is available to us at all. Not seen or heard from in any format for over 30 years, it's a must own for any horror/slasher aficionado.",1409443200,,347,4.2727272727272725
1993706,3,B0001E6CKW,"Those of us old enough to remember can recall a time when slasher movies were everywhere back in the 80's. It seemed like they made a quick visit to the local theater and then filled the shelves of video stores left and right. Some were good, some were bad, but most were similar in content and were not too terrible to watch. It was a time when horror was beginning to become a normal staple of film having been subjected to a once every five year cycle. That has played out to a time now when nearly every week we see several horror films arriving on the DVD shelf.

Among the films being released now are those classic slasher films from the 80's, including the release from Synapse of CURTAINS. Following the formula of a masked killer taking out multiple characters it's actually not a bad film even though it was surrounded by controversy when it was released. That controversy had nothing to do with people being offended by the content but with the film itself, originally directed by Richard Ciupka but taken from his hands and re-edited and shot by producer Peter Simpson. Simpson had a reputation for being difficult to please and that story is best told here in the extras portion of the disc.

The story revolves around a group of actresses gathered at a country retreat to audition for the part of Audra, a role and film that's the pet project of director Jonathan Stryker (John Vernon). When the film opens we witness Stryker help admit actress Samantha Sherwood (Samantha Eggar) into a mental hospital supposedly disguised as a patient. All of this is a way for her to get deeper into the motivations of the character of Audra, to gain insight into what it means to be a mental patient. The problem is that the longer she's there, the closer she becomes the patient she is to play. But is she really becoming that insane character or is it acting on her part?

Suffice to say that years go by and eventually Stryker decides to make the film using a new lead actress. Sherwood hears about this and escapes from the mental ward determined to retake the role intended for her. The problem is there are several other actresses all heading to a remote country estate with that same goal in mind. One is a fading star, another a sexpot, one an ice skating star, a hopeful stand up comedian and more. Each actress is willing to do almost anything to get the part.

As the weekend progresses Stryker tests each actress for the role in various ways. At the same time the girls suddenly begin being killed by a mysterious murderer wearing an old woman mask. Just which one of them is the killer so determined to get this part that they're willing to take out the competition in such a drastic way? Did Sherwood really snap while in the mental ward? Or is it one of the other ingnues seeking fame and fortune?

While the extras talk about the fact that the film was taken over by Simpson who had a completely different take on the material and how it would look, the combining of the two different shoots on the film is relatively unnoticeable. Had I not know that it was going on I probably wouldn't have noticed. When you're aware of this fact sure you notice. Otherwise you just enjoy this as another 80's slasher movie. That's what Simpson wanted where as Ciupka was going for a more stylish film in the vein of DON'T LOOK NOW. This combination of different movies plays well rather than suffer from the melding of the two different takes on the same story.

The acting on display here, from major stars towards the end of their careers to new actresses hoping to ride the wave to stardom, is actually quite good. It's actually a step above what most films of this genre tended to offer. Vernon also does a great job as the director obsessed with a movie that means everything to him. How each brings their character to life here shows they were up to the challenge of making the film believable.

That being said the movie is no high handed drama. It remains a slasher film. This genre was all about finding ways to kill off characters in various means while at the same time keeping the viewer unaware of just who was doing the murders. Consider it a who-dun-it filled with more gore than those stories contain. At the same time realize that the gore factor for 1983 when the film came out is far tamer than we see now. TV series like THE WALKING DEAD have more gross out scenes in one episode than this entire movie. And still it all works.

Synapse has done a great job with the release of this movie to blu-ray. The quality of the transfer is wonderful. The extras included are great as well, giving more background to the making of this film than most features receive. It's interesting to go back and watch the film again after watching that background information. If you're a fan of those 80's slasher films then you'll not only want to watch this film but add it to your collection as well. It's a quality release of a genre that needs to be remembered.",1409356800,,4972,4.486187845303867

1993711,4,B0001E6CKW,"Early 80's slasher film that never get the respect it deserved, probably because of its troubled production history (It started filming in 1980, but two years of reshoots caused the director, Richard Ciupka, to take the pseudonym ""Jonathan Stryker"", which just happens to be the name of the main character in this film, giving the whole viewing experience a ""film-within-a-film"" feel). In the film, conceited and abusive film director Jonathan Stryker (John Vernon; CHAINED HEAT - 1983) has to shelve his latest film, AUDRA, when leading lady Samantha Sherwood (Samantha Eggar; THE BROOD - 1979) suffers a mental breakdown (she tries to stab Jonathan with a letter opener in the doctor's office) and is led away in a straitjacket. It all turns out to be a grand performance by Samantha, since the title role of Audra is a madwoman and Samantha gets herself committed, all in the name of ""research"". Jonathan is in on the ruse, but Dr. Pendleton (Calvin Butler) thinks Samantha is actually insane. The more time Samantha spends in the loony bin with all the female crazies (the screamers, the laughers and even serial ticklers!), the more Samantha seems to go actually mad, so much so that Jonathan decides to keep Samantha in the institution and hold an audition at his mansion with six actresses battling for the role of Audra. What Jonathan doesn't count on is Samantha escaping from the asylum (with the help of some unseen female accomplice) and she vows to get the role back by any means possible. I guess you know what that means: The other actresses auditioning for the role, diva Brooke Parsons (Linda Thorson; HALF PAST DEAD - 2002); ballet dancer Laurian Summers (Anne Ditchburn); stand-up comedienne Patti O'Connor (Lynne Griffin; BLACK CHRISTMAS - 1974); musician Tara Demillo (Sandra Warren; TERROR TRAIN - 1980); professional ice skater Christie Burns (Lesleh Donaldson; FUNERAL HOME - 1980); and Amanda Teuther (Deborah Burgess), begin to meet unwanted (and sometimes gory) demises. But is Samantha the one responsible? Amanda (who likes to play elaborate rape fantasies with her boyfriend, Peter [Booth Savage], when he breaks into her apartment with a stocking over his head and assaults her on her bed while she feigns disgust) never makes it to the audition, as she is viciously stabbed in her own apartment by someone wearing an old hag mask (this is after Amanda has a very vivid death dream about a creepy toy doll, which makes an appearance at two other murders). The other five actresses do make it to Jonathan's mansion, where he introduces them to his assistant Matthew (Michael Wincott; METRO - 1997) and Samantha shows up to tell Jonathan and the other actresses that she is Audra and everyone else doesn't stand a chance. Jonathan disagrees and it's not long before the other actresses begin dying, but what is the connection with the creepy doll?  CURTAINS has its share of atmospheric sequences and shocking deaths. Director Richard Ciupka (DEAD END - 1999) and screenwriter Robert Guza Jr, (who wrote the story to PROM NIGHT - 1980) nearly have this film achieve classic status based solely on the death of Christie Burns, who is ice-skating on a frozen pond to some cheesy love ballad on her radio, when the music suddenly stops and she finds the creepy doll buried in the snow. The killer, dressed all in black (including ice skates!) and wearing the old hag mask, skates behind Christie and attacks her with a scythe, chasing her into the woods and eventually killing her (Brooke finds Christie's decapitated head in her toilet later in the film!). If the rest of the film could maintain this intensity and inventive camerawork, we might be mentioning it in the same breath with HALLOWEEN (1978) and FRIDAY THE 13TH (1980). As it stands, CURTAINS is a well acted, if very fractured (especially the sudden disappearance of Matthew and the non-sensical ending), slasher film that delivers the creepy goods. It's not particularly bloody, but it doesn't need to be. That doll is still sending shivers down my spine! Canadian staple Maury Chaykin (THE VINDICATOR - 1986) puts in a cameo as Brooke's agent. Originally released on VHS by Vestron Video and not available on DVD except as part of the four film THE MIDNIGHT HORROR COLLECTION compilation from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, but buyer beware, because the print used is a VHS port that looks worse than the Vestron Video version. Finally released on DVD & Blu-Ray in a remastered widescreen transfer from Synapse Films. This is the one you want. Rated R.",1408406400,2,4545,4.948952879581152
1993712,5,B0001E6CKW,"Hollywood actress Samantha (Samantha Eggar) wants to get a serious role in an upcoming movie by Jonathan Stryker (John Vernon) as she pretends to be insane to be committed to a mental institution for study. While she is there, there is some recasting begins and there are six women (Lynee Griffe, Anne Ditchburne, Linda Thorson, Sandee Currie, Lesleh Donaldson and Debraoh Burgress) who are in Strykers mansion to spend some nights, however there is a killer in an ugly hag mask killing them one by one but who is this mysterious killer?

Co-starring Michael Kinott from The Crow, this highly overlooked 1983 Canadian horror thriller is a well made and very scary film with nice performances, fine storytelling and a suspenseful score with a memorable murderer who uses a doll at a couple of points. The film is atmospheric and quite similar to the works of Dario Argento. Although it's not really a brainless gore-bath like say Friday The 13th part whatever, this one owes more to the original Halloween to Dario Argento's works like Deep Red and Black Christmas. I always enjoyed this for a long time since i was 9 when i rented it on video and had it taped on tape for a long time as it's been one of my favorite horror and thriller films, if you seek something different i recommend this one.

For a long time the film has been on TV to a few VHS tapes in some time including bootleg DVDs through the years but it wasn't until 2010 when Echo Bridge put this on DVD and it had a murky muddy transfer no different than the bootleg DVDs fans held on to. Luckily last year the rights from EB expired to Syanpse as they released the original untouched film negative that was untouched for 30 years from vault material as they did a labor of love in a new 2K scan. With the new picture quality it offers solid detail from  Vernon's beard to the the wrinkles on the hag mask with stuff you never seen before as it's better than any bootleg or those crap DVDs from Echo Bridge as it has never looked this good. The audio is superb as well with a new remastered soundtrack including the original 1983 mono for the fans. The extras include an audio commentary, an alternate audio track vintage interviews with producer Peter R Sampson and Samantha Eggar, new documentary on the film, A BD exclusive which is Ciupka-A Filmmaker in Transition which has Director Gordon Throne's vintage documentary short with rare behind the scenes footage from this movie to his other stuff which is 15 minutes and trailer.",1408147200,2,2499,4.598654708520179

1993714,4,B0001E6CKW,"I first heard about CURTAINS a long time ago, probably around 1988 or so.  A friend of mine showed me a picture of the hag mask, and my interest was immediately piqued.  Unfortunately at the time, my source for movies was pretty limited, so I wasn't able to find it for rent anywhere.  After a while, the film faded into the dark, cobwebby sections of my mind.

Fast forward to earlier this year.  Imagine my surprise and delight when I received the press release from the fine folks at Synapse films, announcing the release of CURTAINS on Blu-ray.  I cant tell you how excited I was.  Needless to say, there was some cheering involved.  And thankfully, the film exceeded my expectations and then some.  This is truly a horror classic that every fan of the genre should check out.

An interesting bit of triviathe opening credits in the film show the director as Jonathan Strykerwhich is actually John Vernons characters name.  This is a fun homage to the film itself and a nice way to start the film.

CURTAINS is shot pretty well for the most part, although a couple of the camera angles had me puzzled.  The production value looks fairly high (for a film from that time period), and everything looks good onscreen.  The picture is nice and vivid, thanks to an exhaustive restoration effort, and the sound is crisp and clear.

The acting in CURTAINS is great as well.  Both John Vernon and Samantha Eggar give excellent performances, while the rest of the cast also does a top notch job.  I will not divulge the killers identity, but this person does a great job with the role.

And speaking of the killer, I liked the twist as to who it turned out to be.  Definitely not who I expected, and I was very surprised, as I didn't see it coming.  This twist alone was enough for me to recommend the film.

Theres not many special effects to speak of; most of the killings happen off-screen.  But theres plenty of tension built up prior to each one.  And the hag mask is a heck of a persona to display onscreen.  Creepy and haunting, this face is one you won't soon forget!

CURTAINS is a big win for me, and every fan of horror should check it out.  It is a great addition to the slasher genre and deserves a place in every film fans library.",1407801600,,2239,4.439803439803439
1993715,4,B0001E6CKW,"I bought this Blu-ray version as a pre-order and did not do my homework on it as it starred Samantha Eggar and was being brought out by Synapse Films (who expertly were responsible for bringing out some otherwise unavailable Hammer product in glorious Blu-ray editions).  I enjoyed the viewing experience, but after checking out the extras and finding out the actual nightmare of the production problems (half the film was directed by cameraman and director of photography of Louis Malle's ""Atlantic City"", Richard Ciupka who was fired before completing the film by the producer and then finished by the producer Peter R. Simpson nearly a year later), I watched it again and it really, for what accounted for some plot holes and disjointedness, is a remarkable patch-up that definitely shows Al Adamson how his ""Blood of Ghastly Horror"" should have done it.  The original director refused to put his name on it when it was considered finished, and producer Simpson did a really skilled job that kept the film, upon a second viewing, quite capably making a success out of it.  Of course the thing is acted superbly considering the weaknesses brought about by the unstableness of their directors (Kudos to Eggar, John Vernon (Alfred Hitchcock's ""Topaz""), Linda Thorson (TV's ""The Avengers""),  Annie Ditchburn, Lynne Griffin, Sandra Warren, Lesleh Donaldson, Deborah Burgess).  I did not appreciate the score by Paul Zaza as much as other reviewers, then I did not really watch a lot of slasher movies, and I understand this one is especially well written (for a hatchet job it must have provided) screenwriter Robert Guza, Jr. and Editor Michael MacLaverty.  Special Make-up Effects by Greg Cannom should rate a mention.  Synapse helps work the miracle, the extras are good, and ""Curtains"" rides into cinema history as very good, illustrating that what was valid about those early eighties movie techniques (and Canadian independent cinema) takes sometimes a thirty year breather to become bubbly, frothy entertainment currently.

D: Richard Ciupka
C: John Vernon, Samantha Eggar, Linda Thorson, Anne Ditchburn, Lynne Griffin, Lesleh Donaldson, Sandee Currie
P: World renowned actress (Eggar) has herself locked away in an insane asylum at the urging of her film director (Vernon) in order to research a film role. However, after the director leaves her there and moves on with a casting call at a secluded mansion, she breaks out and joins 5 other hopeful actresses looking for their big break, but someone is killing off the competition.

Troubled horror film production in which filming was halted for over a year, one of lead actresses was fired from production with all of her scenes being re-shot, rotating crew, numerous turns at the editing table and a cast & crew that were left wondering if the film was ever going to be completed. As a result, the overall film is uneven and disjointed at times, but when it comes to the film's suspense sequences, that's where Curtains shines. These sequences are stylishly directed, well paced and do an above average job of creating mood, tension and atmosphere. There's a very suspenseful cat and mouse element to these scenes.

Curtains isn't without its flaws and there are some plot holes, but when it comes to delivering on the idea of a truly scary horror film experience, Curtains delivers and then some. [R] 89 mins.",1385337600,2,1441,4.873469387755102
1993721,4,B0001E6CKW,"Curtains, a virtually unknown Canadian slasher by a virtually unknown cast and crew, well the director was the cinematographer on one of the Ilsa of the SS films.

This almost forgotten film is in desperate need of a great transfer, the only copies available are VHS and VHS to DVD versions. Bleak winter atmosphere, creepy dolls on rainy back woods roads, a killer in an old woman mask with a sickle and a scary mental breakdown performance by Samantha Egger (The Brood).

An overbearing director charges six beautiful women to stay with him in his dark secluded mansion  for the weekend to bear everything in an audition for a role in his upcoming film. Jealousy ensues and the women back stab and betray each other until they die off one by one. The lavish death scenes are cruel, like a Giallo and the pace is formidable for a slasher, but the unconventional twist at the end demands a re-watch to follow characters motives.

Curtains was shot in 81 and released in 83 but it feels like a mid-70's horror film, in terms of atmosphere and cinematography. 8 out of 10",1362787200,9,1069,4.610526315789474

Sherwood will be playing a woman with unstable sanity in a film called `Audra'. Little does she know that well known director, Jonathon Stryker, plans to leave her at the mental institution for good. After finding out Stryker is letting a new group of girls audition for the role of Audra, she escapes the asylum and plots for revenge.

One of the girls who was going to audition, Amanda Teuther, is stabbed to death before she even gets the chance to go to Stryker's mansion for the audition in a hilariously over-the-top set piece that actually made me jump a bit. The next day we are introduced to the five other women auditioning for the part of Audra. The girls consist of Patti, Brooke, Laurian, Tara, and Christie. The remaining five girls are left to audition meet Stryker at his mansion. Surprisingly, these five are given more personality than is usually the case in such slashers. These girls are catty, bitchy, and willing to kill for this dream role. Little do they know that there is another visitor along to surprise the hell out of them. If you didn't figure out that Samantha would be appearing at the house without welcome, you owe me your slasher card. Well, after a night of the girls getting to know each other Christie is brutally murdered while figure skating by someone in a grotesque hag mask outside of Stryker's house. Are the rest of the girls next?

""Curtains"" is a whopper of a slasher film that does nearly everything right. Creepy costume? Check. Intriguing backstory? Check. Likable, if slightly over-the-top, characters? Check. Great death scenes? Double check. I know this movie went though hell in post production. Rumor has it that the film was shelved for a year, during which there were re-writes, re-shoots, and one major re-casting done. Eventually numerous crew members had to be re-hired to shoot the footage to complete the film.

This movie should be a mess. The fact that it isn't is a miracle in and of itself but the fact that the movie is a damn near masterpiece? Well, let's just say that the slasher gods must have been looking down on this movie because it is simply incredible. Love the twist at the end, love the figure skater who gets killed by the masked man in the old hag mask, and love the final chase. Sure it isn't entirely believable and there is a bit of logic that must be stretched thin but that doesn't stop this movie from being one of the best of its kind.

The score is perfect and downright chilling. The killer donning an old hag-looking mask is very creepy. All the actors are likeable and are the types you care about and want to root on. The storyline is simple. Six actresses are all called in to audition for a part that is to take place in a snowy, isolated mansion out in the boonies. Is the killer one of them who is trying to eliminate the competition? Does their host have more in store for them than just an audition? You will have to watch and see! It is not predictable, and you will not know who it is until the very end. I really loved this film because of the atmosphere, the actors, the score, the storyline, etc. It was all very well done. You even get a lengthy chase scene with one of the girls near the end. The ice skating scene is one of the most memorable scenes in the film and should be inducted in the horror film hall of fame. This ranks as one of my favorite horror flicks along with Black Christmas and Happy Birthday to Me which are also Canadian horror films. They sure did make some of the best!

1993752,3,B0001E6CKW,"I recently baught and watched this movie. I had been trying to get it for years now, because I had heard some good reviews about it. I will start off by saying it does have some scary scenes in it, but they could have left some of the scenes out. The scene with the one guy who is playing a joke on his wife by sneeking up on her, and pretending to force himself on her. That served no purpose for the movie at all! Also, even worse, was the scene where the director in the movie has two women acting out a lesbian scene, that should have been left out for sure. It had nothing to do with the story at all! I guess like most movies they have to put some uncalled scenes involving sex. The movie would have been much better without those scenes. Now the good, it has 2 or 3 pretty creepy death scenes, especially the girl trying to get away towards the end. Also, the ending is nicely done. Overall I give it a 3 out of 5.",1172534400,3,921,4.010869565217392
1993753,5,B0001E6CKW,"One of the most underrated slasher films of the early 1980s, Curtains has been dissed by many genre critics, but is tops with me.  John Stanley's Creature Features movie guide says of Curtains: ""Irritating Canadian slasher film paints characters in muddy fashion. ...  There's nothing clever or suspenseful about the murders, and the climax is neither riveting nor surprising.  Jonathan Stryker's direction rambles.""

The Overlook Encyclopedia laments: ""After a conspicuously implausible red herring opening ... Curtains takes off into a drearily pedestrian variation on the masked-marauder theme. ... the script has not bothered to provide [the killer] with a semblance of motivation, any more than it has contrived any logic or suspense in the plotting of the attacks.""

I first praised Curtains in the 1980s, in The Journal of Horror Cinema, then in the 1990s in Horror magazine and Horrorfind.  And at least some critics agree with me.  In Slasher Films, Kent Byron Armstrong says: ""Curtains is a very good slasher film.""  [Although he misspells Samantha Eggar's name throughout as Egger.]

Incidentally, contrary to Stanley's remarks, Jonathan Stryker is one of the film's characters, not its director.  I'd thought it was an ""inside joke,"" but Adam Rockoff reports in Going to Pieces that the real director, Richard Ciupka, was fired or quit mid-shoot ""depending to whom you speak"".  Rockoff regards Curtains as ""a decent slasher [film], but one that occasionally hints at greatness that could have been.""

Well, I see more than hints at greatness.  There is much to recommend Curtains, beginning with Samantha Eggar (The Brood, The Uncanny, Demonoid: Messenger of Death), who here portrays Samantha Sherwood, a classy fortysomething actress at her peak and imminent decline.  Curtains also has a sociological dimension, examining two Hollywood customs practiced mostly by men: Riding a superstar wife's coattails to success, and dumping an aging wife.  These customs are not necessarily connected.  The discarded wife is often a quiet helpmate, not a star.  But Curtains combines these themes to fine effect.  And finally, there is a generous body count.

In Curtains, film star Samantha Sherwood buys the film rights to Audra (a hot play about a psychotic) for director Jonathan Stryker (John Vernon).  It remains unclear whether they are (were?) married, but it seems they shared ""something.""  A house in the wintry woods, for instance.

Feigning insanity, Samantha checks into an asylum to better understand her Audra character.  Jonathan leaves her there to rot and sets about casting for a new and younger Audra.  Six nubile actresses are scheduled for ""a weekend audition at his house.""  An unknown woman (we never see her face) liberates Samantha from the asylum.  Samantha arrives at the house to audition.

Everyone playacts in Curtains, on and off stage.  Samantha feigns insanity.  Jonathan feigns his intent to release her.  An actress is ""raped"" by a burglar, who turns out to be her boyfriend playacting their usual sex game.  O'Connor (the comedian in the group) playacts sex games with hand puppets, the dog cajoling a snake to ""give head.""  (Like many comedians, O'Connor hides her pained neuroses and burning ambition behind jokes.)  When the ice-skater discovers Jonathan and Samantha arguing, Jonathan claims they were rehearsing an old play.  After Jonathan abuses O'Connor during an interview, she accuses him of playing

directorial mind games.  He smiles, mum.  When Brooke becomes hysterical, claiming to have seen a severed head in her toilet, O'Connor accuses her of ""putting on a show, acting like Audra.""

Curtains is about people so desperate to ""make it"" in Hollywood that they are always ""in character,"" their personal identities as contrived as the characters they portray, their selves hidden behind curtains of their own making.  After Jonathan has Samantha audition in a crone mask, he yanks off the mask, forces Samantha to face a mirror, and states, ""This is a mask too.""

Curtains examines those willing to do anything to ""make it.""  It's the theme of O'Connor's standup act.  ""Have you ever wanted something so bad you would do anything to get it?  Me, I wanted to be an actress.  I wanted to be in pictures so bad, I screwed the guy from Fotomat."" Hollywood encourages self-deception, and with this attitude the playacting is constant.  One is always in character, projecting an image, the Self ever more elusive.

Samantha suffers and sacrifices to maintain her star status, including the sojourn in the asylum.  But the stay affects her, the patients both frighten and move her.  ""So sad.  Even when they're laughing they're sad.""  She advises O'Connor to forego a career in show business, to ""get married and grow old together.""

O'Connor suspects Samantha of trying to thin the competition, but more likely Samantha is stating what she might do if she could begin again.

Sociology aside, Curtains is an effective slasher film.  The wintry location creates a coldly beautiful isolation, reminiscent of The Shining, Ghost Story, and The Brood.  The slasher's crone mask, worn to hide her identity, also augurs these pretty young actresses likely fate, when they too will be discarded.  Killings are stylized, shot with lyrical slow-motion.  One actress is chased backstage amid mannequins, discovering a dead actress hanging among them (sagacious commentary on Hollywood's meat market?).  The subsequent stabbings (off camera) are punctuated by quick jump cuts amid the mannequins.  Unlike many slasher films, Curtains's killer is difficult to identify (there's a reason for that).

Curtains also functions as commentary on Samantha Eggar's own career.  Named Best Actress at Cannes for her work in The Collector (1965), by the 1980s she had gone to slumming in Canadian slasher fare (to the genre's benefit).  Notably, Eggar's character shares her first name.  Curtains has other curious ""insider"" attributes.  Actor John Vernon portrays the fictitious Jonathan Stryker, yet Curtains is credited to director ""Jonathan Stryker.""  (Actually directed by Richard Ciupka).

Curtains opens with Samantha playacting a scene from Audra.  She finds closure by performing the scene for real.  What has she learned?  ""That an actress must always be in control,"" she tells O'Connor.  It may be for naught.  The final survivor in Curtains, the one who has what it takes to ""make it"" to the end, ends up in an asylum.

Both as a rumination on the relative values of fame and family, and as a tense and gory slasher film set in beautiful wintry isolation, Curtains delivers.",1149638400,5,6611,5.217680608365019
