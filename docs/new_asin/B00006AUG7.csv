7966418,5,B00006AUG7,"The actor John Wayne was a great actor and I love his older western movies because there is no swearing, clean, action packed and full of entertainment.  Helltown is such an example of the above.  Randall collects old westerns because they are clean and help to understand what happens to people who loose their temper and what happens to them.  The reason we have purchased this video is better quality than the videos with two or more videos on one DVD.  The seller was prompt and courteous.",1403740800,,493,4.632183908045977

7966420,3,B00006AUG7,"Hell Town, 1937 film

It starts with a cattle drive of Herefords (not the longhorn cattle of the mid-19th century). Men ride up shooting pistols to turn the herd. Horses are also driven. Three men make a stand by trees. The rustlers drive off the cattle. In town there is action at ""The Casino"".  Tom gives $100 to his cousin and his friend, but this is refused. Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued. Cattle will be driven to the railroad by Dave. Will the rustlers try again? Yes, when there are only two guards.

The cattle arrive in town to be loaded on the railroad for shipment. The cowboys want to celebrate in town. Will Dave play poker? The waiter switches a deck of cards! This lets the professional player win. [A lesson for the audience.] Tom explains his actions to Miss Judy. In town Tom sits in at the poker game and discovers the cold deck! There is a shot, Tom rides off with the money. The gamblers chase them. Will help come in time? Yes. Dave and his partner return to Montana.

Did you learn a lesson about gambling? This was adopted from a Zane Grey novel ""Born to the West"". Professional gamblers know all kind of tricks.",1372723200,,1283,4.355648535564853
