6473694,4,B00L7T54YU,this movie was way better than i thought it would be.  i had never heard of it before but there are a lot of famous actors in it.  it's actually really funny and gets pretty suspenseful at the end.,1411948800,2,197,4.0256410256410255
6473695,5,B00L7T54YU,This movie is both clever and entertaining! I laughed out loud throughout the movie! This is a very well thought out script and a phenominal cast! Excellent indie film! A++,1410825600,2,172,4.766666666666667
6473696,1,B00L7T54YU,"Terrible movie. If Ethan Embry is your tough guy and the poster is him holding a gun, you're in trouble. Another stock premise of guys who run a security business who start robbing people to sell their product. Then they rob the wrong house. This has been done on 50 TV shows and other movies.

I was trying to figure out why three other ""people"" gave this 5 stars then upon further review, if you look at the one ""reviewer,"" all his ""reviews"" are the same and are by the ""director's"" of this trash. All 3 ""reviews"" are 2 sentence ""this was amazing"" review. 5 stars? Really?

You people who work on a video and then come in here and give your work 5 star should be banned. At least pretend  you don't work on the thing and give it four or have some of your shill accounts give it 4 or 3 stars. But 5? Really? This is as good as the Godfather? Amazing.",1410739200,2,851,4.1454545454545455
6473697,4,B00L7T54YU,"""We're talking about robbing these people blind. I'm on bored with that."" Kevin (Embry) and Bruce (Gladis) are best friends and business partners. They own and run a small home security service in a town that is the safest place in America. Facing the possibility of having to close their store they come up with one last ditch effort to save the business. They want to make people feel like they need the security system, so they begin to break into everyone's houses and then sell them the systems. Things are going great until they rob the wrong house. First off this is just simply a fun and entertaining movie. Nothing deep or thought provoking but also nothing mindless either. The idea is funny and the cast is great and really pulls off the necessary timing needed for a movie that goes as dark as this does. The best part of this movie is Cary Elwes. He started off huge in the Princess Bride and Robin Hood but since then hasn't been getting much mainstream work. His turn as a drug lord/mob boss in this is one of the best casting choices in recent years. This is nothing that amazing but it is very much worth seeing, especially for Elwes. Overall, a good movie that kept me entertained and laughing all the way through...even when it went super dark. I give it a B.",1408147200,3,1278,4.465811965811966

6473724,4,B00L7T54YU,"This is a nice little gem of an indie movie. I would put it in the Midnight Run genre, it's an action-adventure movie with a sly sense of humor. Most of the comedy comes from the situations the characters find themselves in, not from jokey dialogue. Which is not to say that there aren't funny lines. There are. They are scattered about like surprising little pieces of candy to enjoy for a moment as the movie marches on. And there are some nice cameos, including Alan Arkin (the cast also includes his son and grandson, so if you're an Arkin fan, I believe this is your only opportunity to see three generations of them in one flick), Ving Rhames, and Ed Begley, Jr.
Cary Elwes plays a bad guy. And the bookend opening and closing is really neat. As a bonus, my dvd gave me the right to download a copy of the movie.
It's totally worth seeing!",1418774400,2,845,4.3544303797468356

6473729,4,B00L7T54YU,This film has a very clever plot and is well acted. It was refreshing to see an r-rated movie that's not just a predictable crime drama with a cliche ending.  Make sure the kids are in bed before turning this on.,1412121600,3,212,4.170731707317073

8664228,4,B00L7T54YU,Armed Response was a good movie. It was like watching Vince Vaughn and Will Farrell together it's full of action but also gives you a laugh here and there. I thought it would be a serious movie but not at all. All I'm gone say is..how do you get pulled over by a cop twice and you never pulled off the first time. Not to spoil it but this is pretty give it a watch.,1443052800,,365,3.88
