7985759,5,B00008N73A,"I am a fan of Cookson's stories, which involve character-driven plots and generally uplifting sagas, something hard to come by in movies today.  The Round Tower is probably my favorite of all of hers (and I own them all).  Its story of the unhappy little rich girl and the hardscrabble but able hero who ultimately rescues her (and vice versa)is nothing we haven't encountered before in one form or another but it is well written and well acted and presents a reasonably accurate picture of the British class system and the contrast between the lives of the haves and have-nots. Emelia Fox and Ben Miles are particularly good as the central couple and have gone on to greater fame in such things as ""Coupling""(Miles) and ""Rebecca""(Fox).  The supporting cast are also excellent and the setting gives the story a feeling of reality.  In all, if you like the old novels of struggle, romance and surmounting the odds, you will like this.  If you need violence, car chases and mayhem, forget it.",1180137600,3,990,4.766081871345029
