8712622,3,B00WAJ8PV0,"This dvd seems to be bits and pieces of  (seems like a cell phone camera was used) Talking about Kid Rock. I thought it was amateurish. I didn't see Kid Rock once except in his performances. ""Saturday Night"" was fantastically performed with
Sir Elton John nodding and smiling in the balcony. This is the only worthwhile thing in this dvd.",1523664000,,338,4.633333333333334

8712627,1,B00WAJ8PV0,"I bought this for my son and it is a total dud.  It's not a documentary at all, it's an amateurish, pieced-together DVD of a few clips of people talking about touring (not Kid Rock) and clips of Kid Rock filmed while singing on a cruise ship and a few TV specials, but the clips are of poor quality.  There is no interview with Kid Rock, nothing suggests it is a film about the story of Kid Rock, or a music documentary at all, other than the misleading cover label.",1440115200,3,466,4.166666666666667
