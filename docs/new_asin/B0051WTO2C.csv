8453343,3,B0051WTO2C,"Saw this on TCM with great crystal clear video.  I thought story line was great when I first saw it, but my second viewing has me saying ""eh...its ok"".  But the bought version is very bad rendition which reminds me of afternoons watching movies that looked like they had been recorded over the last one again and again.  Do not recommend this movie until a better copy comes out, preferably through TCM.",1404172800,,403,4.569444444444445
8453344,4,B0051WTO2C,Very pleased with this release from VCI.  A very good print makes for enjoyable viewing.  It should be noted that this is a re-issue.  The original film production company's name has been removed and the re-issuer's name is on the end title.  Would like to see a British edition of this film.,1325116800,,292,4.5576923076923075
8453345,4,B0051WTO2C,"VCI Entertainment and Atlantic Film Company presents ""THUNDER IN THE CITY"" (1937) (87 min/B&W) -- Starring Edward G. Robinson, Luli Deste, Nigel Bruce, Constance Collier, Ralph Richardson, Arthur Wontner &  Nancy Burne

Directed by Marion Gering

Thunder in the City is very much on the lower end of production values than anything Robinson was doing at Warner Brothers.  But with that said it still is not a bad film, definitely shows the British practice of doing business - not much different than the American way where money is concerned.

Edward G. Robinson went over to the United Kingdom during some falling out with Warner Bros. to star in this film about a fast talking promoter who essentially inflates the value of some mining stock to get more money for the owner who is being squeezed by a tough minded businessman in the purchasing negotiations. The owners are Nigel Bruce and Constance Collier and the businessman is Ralph Richardson in one of his early screen roles.

Can Robinson pick up old country pointers in business dealings in the U.K. - while giving them his philosophy on good old America know how and the game of creating an elution of a good deal, that is really not there without all the marbles.

An excellent cast and a good performance by Robinson who at times carries the film and is a scene stealer  -- this film is still worth a view, especially if you're a fan. Somewhat hokey, but that's the charm of the story that keeps you guessing until the very end of the credits rolling by -- Robinson is a real winner in this one!
