1177873,1,B0000039LU,I'm not going to devote more than a few lines to this most laughable of ANY of the Godzilla series.  Two words: DON'T BOTHER.,946944000,,125,4.208333333333333
1177874,5,B0000039LU,I like this movies alot and I keep watch it ever it my very 2 movies and I keep watch it until I got other godzilla movies.  Jet Jaguar was a hero to me and so is Godzilla so if any of you want to say something bad you better  not make fun of Godzilla.,937785600,,252,3.5636363636363635
1177875,5,B0000039LU,IT HAD ALRIGHT SPECAL EFFECTS BUT GIGAN AND MEGALON TOGETHER WAS TRULEY CLASSIC. IF YOUR A GODZILLA FAN ITS WORTH WATCHING.,930787200,,123,4.904761904761905
1177876,1,B0000039LU,"A waste of time. This is the only Godzilla movie that makes totally no sense and has meaining in the Godzilla series,unlike Godzilla's Revenge(which didn't matter to the series).Jet-Jaguar can be both human  size and the size of Godzilla. How does he do that?Megalon is the sorriest  monster I've ever seen and those people from Seatopia are just plain  dumb! They're so advanced but just can't build nukes or any other sensible  weapon to destroy Earth! Even Gigan,one of the coolest monsters,can't save  this movie. Godzilla didn't exactly look himself either. Maybe they were both  sick from looking at the script! Also,there is no plot. Nothing! Usually the  British don't know good movies(like saying Godzilla vs. Gigan is trash!)but  they're right in this instance. This is a horrible movie!",928540800,,797,5.124031007751938

1177931,3,B0000039LU,"Not certain if anyone has even noticed that the audio for the Japanese version is out of sync to the video. I first noticed this when the Seatopian's voices didn't match the motions of their mouths. Thinking that since the actors were Caucasian I switched the audio to English, but they were still out of sync. Then I noticed when Megalon hammers its hands together the clang was half a second or so late. I know that there are so many of these that the dubbing never matches the actor's mouths for the English soundtrack, but for this the Japanese words are uttered almost as bad. Funny thing is that sometimes its almost on key, like when Megalon jumps, its feet actually make the noise as it hits the earth. I wondered if since you have to read the lines most have missed the fact that the audio is out of sync, because I haven't read anything about this particular problem. Or maybe my copy is defective. Would like to know if that is the case.

As for the movie, there's no real Godzilla monster action/fighting until the hour mark, which reminds me of the complaints from the 2014 movie. Although in the 2014 movie there's no Godzilla fight scenes till way later. I felt that the characters were far too front and center, which other Godzilla movies tend to do as well, but it was just way too noticeable in this one.

If the audio and video were lined up better, the fight scenes were closer to the beginning, then I'd had rated it better. Oh well. I still enjoyed it because the audio isn't noticed as badly because of having to read the dialog.",1492560000,,1553,4.426573426573427

1177952,1,B0000039LU,"No reflection on the movie itself, but after being so excited that this was finally in stock, when I received the disc it wouldn't play (or even load) in my newer blu-ray player or my 20 year old Sony DVD player.  Upon further inspection, this copy was on a recordable DVD, and the artwork on the DVD box had clearly been badly copied from an original (some of the fine print was cut off at the bottom of the back).  I assumed this was from the original manufacturer -- it even came shrink-wrapped -- but I'm not paying $20 for what is essentially a bootleg.  I know Amazon sells some ""recorded on demand on CD/DVDr stuff"", but this was not labelled as such and, of course, didn't work.  Very VERY disappointed.",1485734400,4,711,4.404580152671755

1177954,4,B0000039LU,"I remember seeing this in the movie theatre back in 1975. The picture quality was great, my only complaint is that there is no special features, I mean nothing.  That's why the 4 star rating",1483920000,,190,4.428571428571429

1177957,5,B0000039LU,I loved this dvd because it was my favorite Godzilla movie from my childhood. It brought back a lot of good memories.,1469577600,,117,4.363636363636363
1177958,4,B0000039LU,"First up, this is generally considered to be a contender for the worst Godzilla movie ever made. I won't go that far as Godzilla Raids Again and Godzilla's Revenge are far far worse. But this is a very poor specimen. That is largely saved through nostaligia goggles.

The first, weirdest thing about GvM here is it wasn't supposed to be a Godzilla movie. It was actually supposed to be a new franchise or tv series starter along the lines of Ultraman. It was supposed to be about the mighty super robot Jet Jaguar battling the subterranean kingdom. But the producers felt it needed a name draw so Godzilla got drafted. This has everything. Young Boy who accidentally gets permanently linked to the robot. Super Spy ""Uncle"" of young boy. Secret kingdoms and spies and assassins. Yeah its a 8 year olds fairy tale. Largely badly written and with the lead adult male making you fear you should be calling the FBI to report a possible ""Michael Jackson"".

This devolves into the obligatory 4 way monster fight, largely using stock footage. Where the new stuff is used you can see how badly deteriorated the Godzilla and Gigan suits are. The new monster Megalon is meh. What everyone always remembers about this one is Jet Jaguar. he's like Ultraman's flamboyantly gay brother. Or maybe he's just dressed for Carnival? Either way if you saw this movie back when you were 7 or so. You love Jet Jaguar and he holds a special nostalgic place in your heart. You will love this movie.

If you never heard the opening chords of the Channel 7 ABC 4:30 movie during ""Giant Monster Week"" than you will hate this movie. If you are a significant other of the former, you may consider having him committed. But at least the movie is so bad it becomes wildly cheesy good fun.

oh and Dear Bandai, I still want my Jet Jaguar Action Figure!!!",1469232000,,1821,4.593846153846154

1177965,5,B0000039LU,One of the most disliked (if the THE  MOST disliked) Godzilla film in history. I remember when I had this movie on VHS back in the late 1980s and I have to say the quality here on the Tokyo Shock version is great. The sound was clear and the picture wasn't shadowy or blurry.

1177977,5,B0000039LU,"This movie is a lot like playing in the sand box with a set of Shogun Warriors toys from the 70s. I remember that little activity being quite a lot of fun, too.
This DVD print is the best I've seen. No features or commentary, but I don't give a hoot. It's great to have a Japanese language track, which, in the case of Rokuro's dialogue, is much easier to take from a purely sonic standpoint. And it's nice to watch this movie uncut; I never knew that one of the film's bad guys was dispatched by means of a boulder. That little scene filled in a long-standing gap quite nicely! The ""Jet Jaguar"" theme song has never sounded better.
There are an awful lot of positive reviews on Amazon for a movie most publications disparage mercilessly, all of which are written by fans who actually buy, watch and enjoy these movies. Professional critics and authors be danged! This is the stuff!",1447545600,2,882,4.450617283950617

1177982,4,B0000039LU,"For many of us whose formative years evolved between 1975-85 Godzilla Versus Megalon was a staple of Saturday afternoon Monster Rally and Creature Feature fare.  With repeated television screenings and a plethora of cheap VHS era releases this giant G flick may be the most watched Godzilla movie ever.  Its a shame that its been so maligned.  This particular release by the Tokyo Shock label has a storied history and there are a select few who have this with a bounty of bonus features that were originally intended for all.  But something went amiss along the way and alas, for the rest of us with, we have to be content with this wonderfully presented but bare bones Blu-ray release.  This is the most pristine, clean, and clear release of this flick ever for the major North American market and if you're a G fan then you should pick it up.  Support the label and the love of Godzilla and the hope of seeing more.  As for the movie itself?  The movie (the Japanese print of it) contains some shocking scenes of human-on-human violence for what is regarded as simply a kiddie movie.  The human protagonists are Goro, an inventor who has made himself a surprising robot dubbed Jet Jaguar, his friend Hiroshi and his young nephew Rokuro.  They end up foiling a plan by the Seatopians to spoil the earth utilizing the monsters Megalon and Gigan.  These two hybrid baddies, both with metal appendages (for crying out loud Gigan has a buzzsaw in his belly!), are both grotesquely beautiful in their own imaginative ways.  And like a tag team wrestling duo they beat the tar and oil out of Jet Jaguar who oddly and unexplainably has found the ability to grow to gigantic heights.  Godzilla comes in essentially at the end of the film, arriving late in the day to save the day and Jet.  The banana bar ring tag team brawl that lasts some time giving monster fans a festival of giant monster madness is only missing the ropes around the ring to make it complete.  The film is squarely aimed at the Godzilla audiences that had grown thick as thieves by that time, but also specifically to males too with its eyes set on fantastical sci-fi action.  Why theres no major female presence in the film isn't clear, and American audiences can certainly be confused during a casual watch as to how the three main males are related to each other and/or why they're together.

To read a great treatment of the film pick up a little fanzine called Monster! #11 (the cover calls that particular mag Kaiju! featuring a picture of the giant bat-bird Gyaos from the Gamera series).  Id strongly encourage people who have wanted to get back to viewing this once again to read the spread on on this movie in that little digest fanzine.  It will enhance your pleasure with and for this movie.  I have enjoyed this movie many times over though its nowhere near the top of my list of Godzilla and kaiju flicks.  My favorite Godzilla movie is still one that speaks to my childhood and is perhaps even more (unfairly) maligned than even Godzilla Versus Megalonnamely Son of Godzilla.  Its nowhere near the best Godzilla film out there but GvM will give you a good time and reasons to laugh and to smile, and doesnt short you on the monster action (cough!...cough!...>>ahem<< Godzilla 2014coughcough.).  3.75 stars.",1443830400,2,3287,4.668402777777778

1178050,3,B0000039LU,"I liked the part where megalon's drill hands turned into gigan-hook-hands whenever he swatted airplanes. I wish they showed him rapidly transforming his arms from drills into hooks for split-second amounts of time each time he knocked a plane down. I do not understand why they did not show his hands rapidly transforming from his drills into the hands of another monster and back into his own again so rapidly. It is an amazing anti-plane adaptation. I bet he learned it from gigan, who destroyed planes in a strikingly similar way when he and ghidorah took on G and Anguirus last time. Oh well.  I also liked the careful attention to plot construction and development. I had no trouble understanding how or why Jet Jaguar had been invented, or why he looked like his skull might have been used in the last Indiana Jones movie.  His randomly developed size-changing abilities are more scientifically accurate than Darwinism or any variation of that theory. He totally looked like a robot, and not pile of foam rubber and shiny plastic.  His grin was not creepy, especially not in the company of a little boy. I liked jet jaguar's grin. It made me feel safe.  Seatopia was clearly underwater, and not a  bunch of people doing normal not-under-water stuff. Their Megalon-summoning dance was more pertinent and necessary than any scene from any movie ever made.  I wish that Rodan had a little less screen time, as i felt that he really overshadowed the performance of all other monsters, people and robots. Seriously, too much Rodan.  I also liked how un-ridiculous this Godzilla looks, compared to some of the earlier movies. The soft, weird and annoying soundtrack is way better than the dark, epic and forboding orchestral music from previous films.

Many consider this to be one of the worst Godzilla films, largely due to overuse of stock footage (though this is hardly its only flaw), and as such, shouldn't be anyones introduction to the franchise, as it definitely isn't for everyone.
This film introduces two one-off characters, Megalon and Jet Jaguar. Both are very goofy, but are also filled with enough personality to make them entertaining. Godzilla teams up with Jet Jaguar to even up the playing field, for Megalon has teamed up with Godzillas old enemy Gigan! A great tag-team battle ensues, and will leave fans of the genre satisfied with the outcome. A must have for die-hard fans, but not recommended for those unfamiliar with the franchise, unless they are a child as this film is aimed at that audience.",1414540800,2,841,4.767123287671233

There are no special features at all.

Both language tracks are here which is great.

The biggest issue I had was a weird vhs type scrambled line that would appear at the bottom often. It would always appear if the picture cut to a different angle. It became very annoying as the movie went on. I'm pretty sure this is from the transfer. Did anyone else have this problem?

1178069,3,B0000039LU,"Finally after what seems like an eternity Godzilla vs. Megalon is out on Blu Ray but it doesn't come without some glaring flaws. On the positive side you get both the English Dubbed & Japanese (with subtitles)versions of the film, this was my first time watching the Japanese version so kudos to Media Blasters for that. But the video transfer of this film is terrible, the film seems to have been converted from VHS throughout the movie you see what appears to be tracking lines, film dirt, and other glaring video deformities which really take you out of the movie, the images also appear to be really soft during the final battle. The subtitles are not accurate for the Japanese version of the film, the Japanese word for brother is translated into Goro, which leads me to believe the subtitles are just a closed caption version of the English script. Last but not least, sadly due to legal issues with Toho this is a bare bones release of the film, you get no extras just the film.

Regardless if you're a Hardcore Godzilla fan like myself you're going to want to own this film on Blu Ray for collection purposes but be prepared to be disappointed with the way it's presented. Hopefully in the future this will get the real Blu Ray treatment similar to the Criterion release of Godzilla.",1410480000,3,1291,4.613043478260869

1178071,2,B0000039LU,"As happy as I am that this movie has FINALLY been released on Blu-Ray, I am disappointed. This review is focused on more the release and not ""how good the movie is.""

This is, just like the DVD, a terrible release. Here are my specific reasons:
1. This is a bare-bones release (there are no extras) - After sitting on this movie for almost 2 years, a terrible DVD release, you would think they would do more to put out a quality product. If you thought that, you are wrong (I sure was!)
2. The picture quality is excellent, but the sound is not. I have to crank the volume up just to hear it. I almost had a heart attack at the age of 27 when my PS4's low battery alert came on my screen.
3. Setback after setback, and this is what we get. The original release date was the middle of June 2014. Then it was pushed back to July 2014. And then again to August 25, 2014, then to September 2, 2014, and even then, it shipped 5 days later.

Thank you, Media Blasters, for this terrible release.",1410134400,,989,4.145833333333333
1178072,4,B0000039LU,"Having had this on pre-order for literally over a year as the release date kept getting pushed back, pushed back again and then dropped only to be announced once more later on with an even more distant estimated availability, I am euphoric that finally, at long last, I was able to sit down and see this famous (or infamous depending on your view) Godzilla kaiju flick in HD.

  Godzilla vs. Megalon picture quality was quite good. For a fairly low budget, nearly B-film from the 70s it has held up rather well. The picture was clean, relatively free of grain at most times. On some scene changes there was a slight flicker on the bottom of the screen - I am not sure if this is the result of the encoding or of the quality of the master copy used to make the disc. A few scenes looked kind of washed out, particularly night scenes, and tended to look as if there was a weird filter used in production. Other than these small issues, the picture was very good. The audio was also very good - including the original Japanese and the original American dub that I remember hearing as a kid in the early 80s. Again, overall it's a very nice version.

  As to the movie itself, I won't give away too many spoilers in case someone out there who has not seen it plans on doing so. Among Godzilla fans this is rightly considered by many to be the campiest of all Godzilla movies to date. The posturing of Godzilla, Jet Jaguar (the big guy's Power Rangeresque robot sidekick), and their opponents Megalon (a giant cockroach) and Gigan (a space alien) is truly an attempt to invoke the martial arts genre that was so popular in Asia at the time. My favorite scenes are the ones where the four of them circle each other like fighters in a Kung Fu movie. I still laugh when Jet Jaguar holds Megalon and Godzilla drop/fly kicks the giant insect, literally jumping up and flying at him horizontally in what may be the longest drop kick in martial-arts history. All the camp is funny though seemingly out of place in a Godzilla movie, at least in my opinion. For extra laughs, be sure to listen to the Jet Jaguar and Godzilla fight song at the end of the movie. It will bring a silly smile to your face for sure.

  Overall, this movie did not disappoint. I ended up paying around $12.99 for it on Amazon. The price was fair for a walk down memory lane. The picture and sound were mostly excellent. Anyone interested in seeing a movie that no doubt inspired and was inspired by many of the campy martial arts/kaiju movies and series of the 70s will no doubt see the influence here. If you are an old Godzilla fan, this movie may be the silliest one of them all but it sure is a fun addition to your collection.",1409961600,3,2695,4.363273453093813

However, I will say this much: if you're looking for one of the best, most renowned Godzilla movies of all time, this ain't it.  However, if you're like me and want this movie for pure nostalgia's sake, then this is the DVD for you!

Before buying this disc, I was not expecting much.  It was an older movie and definitely not the most respected of Godzilla films.  However, I was quite surprised (pleasantly) at the quality of this DVD!  Let me assuage any fears by saying that this transfer is great.  The colors are vibrant, and the image is pretty dang good, especially when you consider the age of this movie.  The folks at Media Blasters really did a solid job with this DVD,  and I applaud them for it.  It has actually made me consider getting this on blu-ray (something I wouldn't have done before).

As far as special features...there are none, but for me, that was alright since all the room on the disc was spared for image quality.  Plus, you get the original Japanese audio in case you get tired of that God-awful American dubbing (and I mean that in the nicest way).

Godzilla vs Megalon is a total cheese-fest, but fans of the film will no doubt appreciate this release.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who loved it growing up, or who are simply looking to complete their Godzilla collection.  JET JAGUAR!!!",1408060800,2,1399,4.496031746031746

1178094,4,B0000039LU,"I did not end up purchasing my copy of ""Godzilla vs Megalon"" from Amazon, but I did buy the same product. AS for the product itself, it is pretty good. I have always been happy with Tokyo Shock's products, and this is the same. It is disappointing that their are NO special features. This is not bad, it is just that I prefer some extras. As for the film itself, it is ok. I enjoyed the film, but there were a few things that bugged me. Godzilla was just thrown in to this film for popularity. It was originally going to be a Jet Jaguar ""stand-alone"" with Megalon. But after the film's script was reviewed, it did not receive great popularity. So Godzilla and Gigan were thrown in to give the film a more ""familiar"" tone. I have two words to sum up this film; STOCK FOOTAGE!! This film had some new scenes, but so much stock footage was reused. When Megalon is attacking a town, the town is actually being attacked by Ghidorah's Gravity beams, not Megalon's beams! There is another point were Megalon is seen rampaging through a city, but the ""ground-view"" shots show Gigan's feet, and he has not even shown up yet! The worst scene is when Godzilla is contacted by Jet Jaguar, and he jumps into the water. The suit is clearly not the same as the one just shown earlier. It is the suit from ""Son of Godzilla"" and ""Godzilla's Revenge."" Those are just a few of the scenes I remember. It was very disappointing to see a lack of new footage. BUT! This is still a great film. Any fan of Godzilla will love it. Just don't use it as one of the films you use when trying to introduce someone to the ""kaiju"" genre.",1396483200,,1604,4.314569536423841
1178095,4,B0000039LU,"Number 13 on the Godzilla list has it's good and bad points, but I suppose all Godzilla films do.

The bad: no real Godzilla action until the last 15 minutes of the film and some really silly goings on like flying drop kicks and hand shakes between giant monsters. The English voice track is a bit harsh, especially the voice for that kid!! YIKES!

The Good: there isn't hardly any stock footage used, we get to see some great monster mashing between Megalon, Gigan, Jet Jaguar and Godzilla. There are some really funny moments here, like  flying drop kicks, hand shakes between monsters and wrestler's body english from the monsters. ha-ha! The Japanese voice track is very nice and we get a 5.1 option too.

The film is presented in widescreen and looks very nice with a few (short) rougher spots. Blu Ray is on the way, but I'll have to see a marked improvement for me to upgrade because what's here is pretty darn good!",1396310400,,923,4.542168674698795
1178096,5,B0000039LU,"Released in 1973 Godzilla vs Megalon, is considered among ""G"" fans as either one of the funnest or one of the worst. While not an award winning film by any means, the film offers mindless fun with extra cheese. The monsters are the highlight and are the best effects in the film. Megalon & Jet Jaguar set the mood perfectly, for a wacky sci-fi adventure. Gigan once again returns, however the suit appears more limp and lifeless than his previous debut in ""Godzilla vs Gigan"" (1972). The new Godzilla suit looks great. Godzilla vs Megalon is a B-movie & shouldn't be taken seriously. However although the film is wacky and mindless entertainment, one small key plot segment proves to be the only withstanding piece of the classic 1954's metaphorical symbol for disaster, or rather the key ignition for why Godzilla began. Which will be elaborated on...

Story: When man decides to test nuclear bombs, an underground civilization sends Megalon to attack. Jet Jaguar fights Megalon, and when the civilization discovers that Jet Jaguar has teamed up with Godzilla; they call upon space nebula M to send Gigan for help.

The plot is rather thin and sadly Godzilla has fairly small amount of screen time. Originally the film was only to star Jet Jaguar, Megalon, & Gigan; however Godzilla was thrown in at the last minute for marque value. There's quite a bit of stock footage.

Good: Good suit effects, cinematography, and decent pacing.

Updates:  Tokyo Shock clears up the audio & cleans up the picture; and makes the film crisp & clean.

Good News: Tokyo shock is re-releasing Destroy All Monsters in a bare bones dvd & singular, and also as a double feature with Godzilla vs Megalon. They also plan to bring a special edition & blu ray of Godzilla vs Megalon. However this isn't till this July.

Fun Facts: The film was made within weeks! This Gigan's second debut, he would go on to star in Godzilla: Final Wars (2004), and starred in his own film; Godzilla vs Gigan (1972). The film was showcased on Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Happily, they were not trying to extort us Godzilla fans by charging hundreds of dollars. I got it for around $15.00. The movie is a lot of fun and almost has an anime feel to it. The dvd itself is good quality and looks very good on my 54"" TV. If you are a Godzilla fan, get this DVD while you can.

The movie poster actually had Godzilla and Megalon fighting on the roofs of the twin towers in New York - which of course had NOTHING to do with the movie. Great, campy fun, but the voice of that darn kid is worse than nails on a chalkboard. I almost want to nail my ears closed, however the Jet Jaguar song at the end makes up for the kid's voice. Good, old-fashioned, unbeatable Godzilla kicking the bad guys' butts - unlike the newer movies where he seems to lose or die every time.",1390089600,,562,4.165137614678899
1178100,3,B0000039LU,"My rating is based primarily on just how goofy this entry in the series is, and that's saying something. It is a fine film for young kids but silly beyond belief for anyone over the age of five or six. The villains are ridiculous (subterranean toga party, dude!) and the bug monster Megalon is poorly executed, with the wires that support him during his absurd seesaw flight scenes painfully obvious, even for a Godzilla movie. The ever-dwindling budgets of these films really starts to show in this particular entry. Jet Jaguar, the new robot buddy for Godzy to team up with is a poor knock off of Ultraman, Goldar, and a host of other Japanese robotic TV heroes whose shows never saw stateside release. The robot's huge grin makes him look like a spongy cybernetic Jack Nicholson. How does he suddenly grow from 6 feet to 150? Why... because he figured it would come in handy, so he programmed himself to be able to, that's how! ??? Remember folks, this is the 70's Godzilla. It's best not to ask. As for poor Godzilla himself... he looks like a giant, puffy puppy in this picture! The huge, Disney-esque eyes kill ANY resemblance to the fierce radioactive terror of Tokyo from past movies. And let's not forget his infamous sliding tail jump kicks! Wow. This entire film was made much easier to digest when the crew of MST3K spoofed it. Sadly, their adaption is no longer legally available. I bought this DVD because I am one of those guys that has to have every entry in a series of films, no matter how bad. Truthfully, I've only watched it once; just to make sure it wasn't defective and would play correctly. It's one of those Godzilla films I will watch maybe once every five years or so.

On the good side, we finally get this heretofore legally unavailable G-film in a nice, widescreen edition instead of the old, washed out, pan&scan public domain (which it never really ever was) junk versions found in dollar DVD bins at lesser retailers around the country. The colors of this print are bright & vivid, the clarity is sharp & crisp, and the sound is strong & clean. The optional English dub seems to have been cleaned up a bit, but still sounds as tinny (and as goofy) as ever. It is good to have though, if you don't like to read subtitles, plus the nostalgia factor makes the English dub a nice bonus, since this is the movie a lot of people were exposed to as their first Godzilla film. Not because it was so great, but because it was so readily (""cheaply"") available on VHS (in crummy ""EP"" speed, no less!) from GoodTimes home video. Others may remember NBC network's notorious prime-time debut of a heavily-edited version of ""Godzilla VS Megalon"" as the NBC movie-of-the-week, hosted by none other than SNL superstar John Belushi(!), wearing a cheesy G-costume originally built for the 1976 film ""Hollywood Boulevard."" Now I have to admit that the Belushi-hosted version of GvsM is something I would LOVE to have in my collection! Here's to someday, maybe. Anyhow, the excellent quality of the source materials Tokyo Shock used for their DVD master makes this movie much more enjoyable and easily ups my overall rating by another star. So, I give this quirky Godzilla outing 3 out of 5 stars.",1389916800,2,3210,4.6414762741652025

This beats the original VHS version by a long shot with quality generally the same as any other Godzilla dvd you'll find. This release greatly improves the video and audio quality problems that were in the original release; 1. the day scenes are very clear and the night scenes have been appropriately brightened so you can see the action much more clearly. 2. The majority of the dialogue throughout the film is almost crystal clear, where as in the VHS version it was very scratchy and hard to understand what people were saying. Also, this dvd is uncut, in other words it's basically the japanese version of the film with english dubbing (I've seen both versions). A blu ray copy of the film is supposed to be available on amazon.com soon if it isn't already, I may order it and compare the two. Based on the performance by another Godzilla blu ray film I have, it should work out wonderfully. Finally, there are no extras on this dvd, perhaps they are saving them for the blu ray copy?

1178109,4,B0000039LU,"Ok, ok, first off let me say what everyone who is a Godzilla fan already knows. This is not the best Godzilla film. It seems as if it was made as kids Saturday morning movie or something. The plot has more holes then swiss cheese (which is saying alot for a Godzilla movie) and the acting and characters feel like they belong on a poor mans Muppet's show. And speaking of the Muppet's, this is the Godzilla suit that I like to call the Muppet suit, which if you look at it he does kind of look like one.

Ok now that the negative comments are out of the way let me explain why this is a good one. There are at least two reasons to get this movie. One is because it is so bad that you have to watch it, I mean come one MST3K did a spoof on this classic for a reason people. Or you get this because you realize that hidden among on the campyness is a fun movie. Now I watched this as a kid, and not having alot of access to Godzilla films, it was pretty much this movie and Godzilla Raids Again. So you watch this movie enough you begin to enjoy it, not seeing all the things that people hate about it. The Monster fight alone is worth the price, as it take guys in rubber suits fighting to the next level. It is campy and fun, and just has this certain charm to it that is hard to put in to words.

I can go on and on with the why's of why I like this movie. But in the end it comes down to this, you will either like it or you wont, there really is no middle ground here. So if you can check your criticism at the door and just sit back and watch some campy fun then I think you will get a kick outta this one. If not then stay way as this movie will be like nails on a chalkboard to you.",1381104000,,1688,3.8477011494252875
1178110,3,B0000039LU,"Eh. It was O.K. I didn't particularly like the design of this Godzilla. The 60's/70's era of Godzilla movies are my favorite even though they are by and large silly. The plot is pretty odd and mostly revolves around 2 scientists, a boy, and the antagonists who are people who live in the earth's core. Godzilla barely shows up at the end for the tag team match between him, Jet Jaguar, Gigan and Megalon. I wanted Godzilla to be more crucial, but it mainly is about the Subterreanean people and the andriod Jet Jaguar (which inexplicably develops a conscience and artificial intellegence, and changes size, but reverts to being a mindless robot once his ""purpose"" is complete---it's just a way to get a plot thread).",1380931200,,716,4.736

They must have definitely made this one just for the kids, cause I loved it. It reminded me of a WWE Tag Team wrestling match, only it had giant monsters and robots in it. I thought this was SO COOL , note I was a little kid back then so yeah of course. I did and besides if you don't watch these with your imagination , your never going to enjoy it. And of course this may look corny and campy to today's jaded cynical audiences. Always comparing the gems of the past, to today's computer generated spectacles. But what people today keep forgetting ,is that back then they didn't have computer animation. Technology so they had to make, do with what special effects equipment. And make-up techniques that they had at the time,but it's that feeling of nostalgia. That I get when , I watch this movie. It's that feeling of being a kid again , no matter how old you are. And you bet that I was happy when this came out on to dvd. And the original price was 4.99 , I just had to get it. Thank you Amazon. com!!!!!",1371945600,,1183,4.170305676855895

For me, living near Kansas City, Missouri, every October the local CBS affiliate, KCMO (channel five), ran a week called ""Creature Feature Week."" The Godzilla movies were always prominent showings and I could not wait to get off the school bus to see the monster goodness!

I do remember Godzilla vs. Megalon and the super long staircase the Japanese heroes had leading to there house. Who could forget the ""coolness"" of Jet Jaguar as well?

Anyway, I popped this DVD into the player and settled in with our two young kids only to have my mouth drop as one of the main characters utters quite a few curse words (of the ""d"" and ""h"" variety). Is it possible that the English dubbed version I watched as a child was a secondary dubbing for no cussing came over the airwaves during Creature Feature Week back in the late '70s! There is also a scene that has, in the background, a fully naked centerfold of a woman (I suppose this was edited out of the film when I watched it way back, but to be fair, maybe not for I doubt I would have even noticed it at ten or eleven years of age. I was always waiting for the ""men in rubber suits to appear,"" the story of the thing only got in the way! LOL!).

I was sadly disappointed by this and am really puzzled if the version on this disk is really what was released in the U.S. back in the 1970s.

Anyway, this review is more of a warning for parents to not do what I did and assume that just because this is an old Godzilla film it is child friendly.",1364688000,2,1602,4.2254901960784315

1178141,5,B0000039LU,"This movie is absolutely horrible. However, the quality is great. Possibly the worst Godzilla flick out there. A must have to any G fan.",1363564800,,136,4.708333333333333
1178142,4,B0000039LU,"I have always liked ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" but I have never thought it was nearly as good as classic Godzilla movies like the original ""Gojira"" (Released in the US as ""Godzilla:  King of the Monsters"".) or ""Ebirah:  Horror of the Deep"" (Released in the US as ""Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster"".).  Like many Godzilla fans I originally owned a very badly dubbed (When is dubbing ever good?) and heavily edited VHS tape with very poor picture quality.  When I heard Media Blasters had restored the original movie and released it on DVD, I jumped at the opportunity to see it.

To begin with Media Blasters has done a very good job restoring ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" to its original form.  The original dialogue tracks have been restored, the many scenes that were cut from the US release are back which greatly improve the movie (I had no idea that the character of Gigan was even in the movie.) and the sound and picture quality are excellent.

However, having the original movie restored does not make it great.  It's easy to understand why many fans consider this one of Godzilla's worst.  The story is a bit cornball.  The undergorund city of Seatopia decides they can no longer tolerate the serious threat to their home by Japan's constant nuclear testing.  In response they decide to release their monster Megalon to wreak havoc on Tokyo.  Agents from Seatopia steal an experimental robot named Jet Jaguar to guide Megalon to his intended targets.  The agents kidnap Jet Jaguar's inventors and a young boy who is the inventor's friend in order to take Jet Jaguar.  The inventors eventually overpower their captors and regain control of Jet Jaguar.  They send him to Monster Island to hopefully summon Godzilla to fight Megalon.  Upon learning this Seatopia summons the monster Gigan from deep space to assist Megalon.  When Jet Jaguar sees Gigan arrive, he somehow or another grows himself to enormous size to team up with Godzilla to even the odds in the fight to save the day.

The fight scenes look like kiddie fights.  They hurt the movie to a certain degree, but they do add a bit of comedy relief so there is some redeeming value.  The dialogue is also a bit cheesy.

Overall, ""Godzilla vs. Magalon"" is no classic, but the restored version of the movie is much better than the version we grew up with.  It's not great, but it is entertaining.",1363564800,,2346,4.712530712530713
1178143,4,B0000039LU,"The movie was what I expected. Better than anything else available now. A fun movie to watch, even for the kids.",1363478400,,112,4.380952380952381
1178144,5,B0000039LU,"Picture quality is much better than the original. brighter and clearer.  the english sound track was OK, but sometimes scratchy sounding",1363046400,,136,5.476190476190476
1178145,2,B0000039LU,"A nuclear blast over the Pacific Ocean uncovers the lost civilization of Seatopia, but its people do not come in peace. Instead, they send out their spies to steal an advanced robot from a group of inventors, which the Seatopians plan to use to wage war against the people of Earth along with their gigantic guardian, Megalon! Unfortunately for Godzilla and friends, GODZILLA VS MEGALON gives critics the perfect example they need to lambast the giant monster genre at large. Between the unspeakably odd people of Seatopia, the asinine spy drama, and the abusive amounts of stock footage, GODZILLA VS MEGALON deserves every murderous attack that has been made against it. It starts off with a confused script filled with unfinished ideas and half-written characters that are then mashed together into a bloody mess. Godzilla's new teammate, the heroic robot Jet Jaguar, is another unnecessary ingredient. Jet Jaguar was the winning design in a contest that the studio had put on for children. The result is a cheap Ultraman knock-off that detracts even further from the film. Megalon's assault on the dam offers the only impressive miniature destruction, although Godzilla's menacing new look comes as an added bonus, as well. The rest of this childish production is entirely disposable, making this one of the worst entries in the series, by far.

The DVD is of great quality. The sound and picture are great. I am an over the road trucker. I watch my DVD's on a small DVD player screen.

1178148,5,B0000039LU,"All of you out there who would want to order this movie are just like me- A super Godzilla- Japanese Movie SYFY Fan.  My first viewing of Godzilla was on Million Dollar Movie in the early 60s on WOR TV Channel 9 in New York City but I can go back further.  My sisters and I dragged my father to see Rodan in the theaters- very limited showings at the cheap movie house which played only Science Fiction and Horror movies every Saturday for 25 cents.  In those days, there wasn't the fear of dropping your children off at the movie house, giving them money for the movie, a bagged lunch and an additional dime, if you were good all week and did your chores, to buy a 5 cent coke and 5 cent hershey bar or any candy bar which were all 5 cents.  We got three movies, cartoons, news, and upcoming attractions which is where we saw the trailer for Rodan.  That movie was a bit more expensive and required a parent so all week we worked more and also worked on my father to be that responsible parent.  That Saturday morning arrived and off we went and saw Rodan.  We kids loved it but my father was very uncomfortable with the early mine scenes with the bug monsters.  That, I know, scared him but he too loved it.  Right from there, any Japanese monster movie was for us which was in short supply.  Then Million Dollar Movie with a weeks worth of Godzilla every night from 730 to 900.  As I got older we saw more and more on TV, not cable- That was not invented yet..  Then when the VCR came out and VHS tapes became available and by then with me having a famility of my own, Godzilla became a part of my children's lives and loves.  Now on to this movie-
I have the old VHS tape - well actually I still have all the ones I bought and the DVDS I bought to replace them.  Word of warning- buy the good DVD copies, not bad ones like Alpha-  This movie is crisp and clear and has a story that you can follow which was a little short in the VHS copy.  Godzilla is hilarious as he stomps around and boxes.  He and Jet Jaguar tag team Megalon and Gigan is hilarious entertainment for most ot the end of the movie.  So FUN!!!!!  This ranks right up there with my favorite- Godzilla vs Hedorah (Smog Monster).  This is the light Godzilla who was our protector.  It is so entertaining and I highly recommend buying it.  Once you get it, put in the the DVD player, gather the kids or grandkids like me and sit back and enjoy it.  Word of warning- Loving all things Godzilla is highly contagious- my daughters and especially my son all love that monster-  I brought them up right.  Thank you.",1360454400,8,2577,4.19959266802444
1178149,5,B0000039LU,"This movie in my mind is by far the best movie in the Godzilla universe.  A great mixture of evil monsters bent on destroying the world, a robot that decides to increase in size and defend the planet and if it couldn't get any better...Godzilla comes in and helps the Robot Jett Jaguar to defeat the monsters Megalon and Gigan!!!  A wonderful ballet of fighting, roaring, and a great combination of comic relief all in the movie.  My favorite part is how Godzilla does a very long super-sliding double leg kick to Megalon as Jett Jaguar is standing him up to receive Godzilla's mighty kicks.  The 5 stars I gave this movie is not enough to recommend this movie!!!!  This is a must-have Godzilla movie and I give it my highest recommendation.

It's nice to finally have a good copy of this film.  Back in the late 1990s (around the time Roland Emmerich's Godzilla came out) I bought a 5-movie box set of Godzilla films that included this one.  However, most of the films in that pack were dreadfully low quality.  This one was one of the worst, the picture was sub-standard and the audio was horrible.  It was so low that I had to turn the TV volume all the way up to hear the dialog, which caused a loud buzzing sound to come from the speakers and make the dialog I was straining to hear harder to hear.  (ugh)  However, this DVD is beautiful.  The picture and audio are digitally remastered.  The picture is very crisp and in anamorphic widescreen.  Plus, the audio is fantastic.  Since I don't know Japanese, I watched it with the Dolby Digital 2.0 English track and was finally not straining to hear the dialog.  I also watched a bit with the Dolby Digital 5.1 Japanese track and it sounds even better.  Too bad there's not a 5.1 English track, but I'm not complaining.

The movie itself isn't one of the more popular G films, but I like it.  The Seatopians have their panties in a bunch.  Their underwater society (a Japanese Atlantis-type mythology) is being affected by nuclear testing.  Naturally, they blame the ""surface dwellers,"" even though the surface dwellers have no clue they even exist.  So, rather than making the rest of the world aware of their presence and telling them to cut it out, they launch an attack.  So, they send the giant termite (or whatever he's supposed to be) Megalon to attack the surface dwellers and make them pay for a crime they don't know  they're committing.  Naturally, the people above send for Godzilla, who's still in his ""good monster"" shtick that he started in the mid to late '60s.  The Seatopians contact the Cockroach aliens from Godzilla VS Gigan (which shows you where their loyalties lie) and they send Gigan.  Then it's an all-out monster brawl between the team of Megalon and Gigan and the team of Godzilla and Jet Jaguar (a giant robot.)

All in all, it's a great film, despite the somewhat silly plot.  But, several of the G movies from the '60s and '70s had silly plots, but they're still a lot of fun.  The movie itself is actually a 4/5 for me, but I tacked on an extra star for the quality of the DVD.",1353715200,,2547,4.504366812227074

Filled with crazy chase sequences, a size-altering robot, and a tag team fight against Megalon and Gigan, what more could you ask for?  Well, all right, true, Godzilla could have at least had a little more screen time in his own movie.  Instead, he was the sidekick to a robot named Jet Jaguar.  A robot with very little personality, I might add.  At times, it felt like their relationship was that of a boy and his dog!
I especially enjoyed listening to the English version with the English subtitles that more often than not, contradicted that which was said.  Very amusing.

1178189,4,B0000039LU,"In Japanese, Kaiju means monster. Toho Studios pioneered the Man-In-Suit technique to bring giant monsters to life on the big screen after deciding stop motion animation was too cost prohibitive.

I was always a Toho fan and a fan of Godzilla in particular! I recall seeing Godzilla vs Megalon with friends in 1975 at the dollar theater as a kid and, along with most other Toho films, I have owned this film in pretty much every format known to man -- including the MST3K version...which is a hoot! Indeed, there is much to laugh at in this movie! SNLs John Belushi once hosted a network airing of this film on NBC during the 70s...and provided his own antics to accompany the film during commercial breaks.

For the uninitiated, GvM details what happens when the inhabitants of the lost civilization of Mu unleash the monster Megalon -- a giant winged bug -- on humanity as revenge for testing nuclear weapons near its territory. The skirt-clad leaders of Mu also want to steal the robot invention of two scientists -- Jet Jaguar -- and build an army of robots so they can take over the Earth.

In fact, GvM was originally planned to not include Godzilla at all but was included late in the planning of the production. You can tell because he shows up late in the film to team up with Jet Jaguar against Megalon and Godzilla nemesis, Gigan.

Never has this looked as good as it does here on this DVD version from Tokyo Shock -- a purveyor of fine Kaiju on DVD. TS has released other monster films from Japan and when I see that label on a DVD package, I know I'm going to get quality!

All the grain and film defects in previous releases if this film are gone! The colors are vibrant and accurate and the soundtrack is available in dubbed English and the original Japanese with subtitles.

My main gripe about this release is the lack of bonus features. There are none! Even a commentary from famed Godzilla expert Ed Godziszewski (who has provided commentary on previous Toho DVDs) would have been welcome. Or the original trailer. But, alas, no bonuses.

Still, this is the very best this film has ever looked and I highly recommend it to any Kaiju fan! I applaud Tokyo Shock on another excellent remastering and finally presenting this film as it should have always been seen. I can say it even looks better than it did that evening at the dollar theater with my junior high buddies!! :-)",1350345600,,2392,4.561771561771562
1178190,4,B0000039LU,"The undersea kingdom of Seatopia has had enough, reckless nuclear testing has destroyed their country and its time for them to strike back with their ultimate weapon, a Kaiju called Megalon to stomp the surface dwellers in the worst way.  But in order to make their plans work they need some less than willing assistance. Agents of Seatopia kidnap an inventor that has just completed a robot christen Jet Jaguar. Being nothing more than an automaton the Seatopian agents force Jet Jaguar to guide Megalon on its destructive path, it is only after the inventor escapes that he's able to regain control of his creation and sends off to Monster island to fetch Godzilla, since the military, like always, has no luck in stopping the giant Cockroach.

GVM has place in the annals of bad movies that it doesn't truly deserve, for what it is GVM is actually a very decent film that only suffers from a low budget and a child audience focus. Many of the Godzilla films from the late sixties through the seventies where cheaply thrown together using stock footage as Toho Studios was going through budget crunches at the time but where also putting out massive amounts of movies, more than they should have.  Godzilla doesn't even show up until the last act of the movie, because GVM wasn't even supposed to be a Godzilla movie at all. It was supposed to be a standalone title for Jet Jaguar, much like Rodan and Mothera were. But Toho didn't think that an unknown Character in an already overcrowded market could carry the film on his own, so they threw in Godzilla and Gigan in at the last minute along with a quick script rewrite.  The first half of the movie actually plans more like a spy film than a Monster Mash, which isn't that surprising when you learn that the film's director, Jun Fukuda, worked on spy and crime thrillers. The Godzilla suite for this movie was made in just a week and contrary to what nay sayers spit, I think it's fairly decent costume.
GVM is far better than ""Godzilla's Revenge"". That movie is baaaaaad.

Features wise the DVD contains the original Japanese language track. An interview with the film's English narrator, an amusing and informative commentary track and finally some trailers and TV spots thrown in.",1350172800,,2238,4.713554987212277

But I relented as this is a sentimental favorite from my childhood and I was eager to see it cleaned up after the countless bad VCR dubs I have had to endure over the years.
  I watched the film in its original Japanese version and what a job they have done!  Great visuals and audio, plus they reinstate some scenes (the deaths of the Seatopian bad guys) that had always been hacked out of the US version.  But imagine my surprise to find not only a features menu, but an audio commentary as well!  Granted, there are not as many goodies as on Destroy all Monsters, but besides the commentary it does have an interview with one of the dubbing actors and a host of international trailers and TV spots.  The commentary is informative and fun to listen to, as it features an interview with the former head of Cinema Shares, the film distributor that released G v M in the US in 1976 to great success.  So if you are waiting for the blu-ray to get the bonus features, I tell you just get this....who knows if a blu-ray will ever be released thanks to Toho.",1350000000,,1226,4.23175965665236

First of all Godzilla is in it, second of all there's a giant robot, and it used alot of recycled movie footage way before recycling was cool.  It's worth getting just to see Godzilla slide for about 300 yards, suspended only by the strength of his tail, and slam into another monster.  Not once but twice.  I do realize maybe this movie isn't for everybody.  I'm 43 years old and grew up seeing this movie on TV, alot.

However, it ranks as one of my favorites in the Godzilla library.  As a kid, Megalon would air on TV the day after Thanksgiving and I always found it highly entertaing. It is interesting to see Japan in the 70's (a lot of Beetles yellow submarine influence going on), cool characters & monsters, an emotive 70's soundtrack, and the fun simplicity of the plot (won't go into it, but you can read amazon's description).

This DVD marks the first time Megalon has been officially licensed in it's original anamorphic widescreen presentation for sale in the USA.  It's not high definition; but the picture quality is clear and colorful and easily stomps all past US releases.  Sound is powerful too, offering English (2.0) and Japanese (2.0 & 5.1) soundtracks with optional subtitles.

Fans have been waiting for this one too long.  With it selling out on the internet and production being limited, this will be the version to own for quite sometime.",1346544000,,1074,4.836065573770492

Personally- I felt that 1972's ""Godzilla vs Gigan"" (aka ""Gojira tai Gaigan"")is easily the worst effort of the original films!
Media Blasters has done a fine job presenting the film in widescreen format (anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect ratio) and offers the original English 2.0 dub as well as the native Japanese audio tracks in both 2.0 and 5.1 sound (with optional yellow English subtitles)!
The clarity of the dvd is so good that many subtle touches like the Megalon broached head-band that the Emperor Antonio of Seatopia wears to all the wire work on the Maser Canons and monster suits of Megalon and Gigan which are now clearly visible! Colors look very accurate and not overtly tweaked. Film grain remains fine and print quality is good, just expect some stock shots to look rougher is places.
Looking at the situation between Media Blasters (owner of the Tokyo Shock label) and Toho--there is no reason to wait on the Blu Ray. Being a big Godzilla fan, I was a little disheartened that Toho made things so difficult for MB after their respectable dvd and Blu Ray for ""Destroy all Monsters"". At least MB made good on getting this film committed to dvd for the consumer! The picture quality is very good for the dvd format. So many companies just don't take the time to master their films for the format, artificially inflating the contrast between dvd and Blu Ray quality.

1178228,5,B0000039LU,"Many critics have cited that this is one of the worst Godzilla movies ever created. I would have to agree and for that reason it has become a guilty pleasure. As I have stated before Toho studios began making Godzilla movies for younger audiences throughout the 1960s. With Godzilla vs. Megalon Godzilla movies had reached their zenith of child friendly movies or they had reached the depths of trashy silliness depending on ones perspective. I believe I enjoy this movie solely because it exemplifies how juvenile and ridiculously wacky the movies had become. I enjoy the character of Godzilla and this move displays all the campiness that had become associated with the series by the mid 1970s.

The plot and visual effects play as it is is straight from a Saturday morning live action TV show. Godzilla himself looks like he is a cousin of Kermit the Frog and about as threatening. The plot consists of an ancient race of humans called the Seatopians that dwell beneath the ground. They are angered at the nuclear tests that have been conducted which has affected their civilization and they seek revenge by unleashing their monster/god Megalon upon the earth. Megalon resembles a giant cockroach with two legs and two metal spirals on its two arms in place of hands. The Seatopians also steal the robot Jet Jaguar in their efforts to destroy the earth. Japan's Defense Force is able to recapture Jet Jaguar from the Seatopians. Jet Jaguar, who is able to magically grow to equal the size of Godzilla is programed to go to Monster Island and illicit Godzilla's help in defeating Megalon. However, Megalon himself is teamed with Gigan from the previous movie and the resulting tag team monster fights, which take up a good portion of the later half of the movie, provide much of the laughter and entertainment. The highlight, or low light, of the monster battles is when Godzilla delivers two flying kicks balanced only on his tail to the vanquished Megalon.

Don't get me wrong this is a bad movie but it is a movie that is laughably bad. If you are the type of person that enjoys movies that are bad purely for the laughs then you might enjoy this. There are better made Godzilla movies out there and I am glad that Toho did see the levels to which Godzilla had sunk and began reversing the trend.",1345334400,2,2301,4.707196029776675

The not so special effects are even funnier with the high quality transfer. The film is presented in wide screen format. The sound is clear sounding with the option of Japanese with yellow English subtitles. Get ready to laugh out loud at this remastered classic.

If you're going to wait for the Blu Ray, that is your choice, but for someone like me, a lifelong die hard Godzilla fan who flew to Burbank to meet Godzilla ( Harou Nakajima) this was a no-brainer pick up for me.
The plot is very simple. Most of you reading have seen this in some form be it VHS, TV, MST3K etc..The underwater world of Seatopia decides now is the time to strike back against Japan for all of its nuclear testing. They steal an inventors Robot named Jet Jaguar to guide the great beast, Megalon to destroy the Earth. The inventor is able to get control of Jet Jaguar just in time to get Godzilla. What we get in the payoff is Megalon and Gigan vs. Godzilla and Jet Jaguar in a tag team WWE/UFC fight.
As most of you know, the film is considered one of the, if not, the worst due to the juvenile feel this movie has, clearly made for kids. And to save a few yen, the film also boasts about 95% stock footage of city destruction scenes.
While the film itself is thought of as bad, its actually a lot of fun in a Kaiju Cult kind of a way.
As for the DVD. I was very much impressed with this widescreen transfer. Media Blasters did a tremendous job with the transfer. The movie has NEVER looked better on DVD stateside. Day scenes look great, night scenes aren't too dark or black, colors are sparkling. And it is uncut, with the opening credits (in Japanese) as well as several scenes such as the boy getting kidnapped, the agent getting crushed by a rock, etc. And the ending with the song has English subs !! :)
I watched the English dubbed version and its the familiar dub and it was loud and sharp. No adjusting the remote to higher levels to listen to it - it was English 2.0 , while the Japanese language has both 2.0 and 5.1
This is a barebones release with the probable release of a Blu Ray down the road. There are reasons for Media Blasters being unable to release the Blu Ray version with all the extras. These reasons can be found on Facebook, their own website, SciFi Japan, etc.
For me, this suits me just fine because it is an official release. I am a huge Godzilla fan and I want everything on DVD or Blu Ray. And while I wait for an HD version, this will proudly sit in with my other Godzilla movies, most of which are on DVD by the way.

1178231,3,B0000039LU,"Why do all of us in our 30s-40s remember this Godzilla movie the most from our childhoods?  It was one of the G-films that fell into public domain and therefore was released continuously on various home formats and aired endlessly on television -

If you're a G-purist, it represents the film series' final decline into a children's format.  If you're just a kid who grew up on kaiju movies in the US, it's a really fun, silly movie where the big G (in a recycled suit showing some wear) takes on Megalon and the famous Gigan (who got a makeover in Final Wars) by teaming up with JET JAGUAR, the Ultraman-style robot who can go from 6' tall to 60' tall for no known reason.

Featuring the worst english dub track of many of the films (or the best, if you have a fetish for little boys in hot pants that screech like nails on a chalkboard) it's a gem of a G, no matter how you slice it.

I can only assume there are no extras because whatever company now has the rights is just throwing this in their catalog and not really giving it any love.  It's a shame that the folks who made the excellent ""Toho Master Edition"" DVDs did not release this, or I'm sure they would have tracked down extras.  From what I understand they released all the movies they had rights to, and don't have anything left to give us.  (Their catalog also included a Rodan & War of the Gargantuas 2-pack).  They're all without a doubt the best American G-releases ever done in the states.

Far as I know, the only DVD with extras for this movie is the Godzilla ""final box"" Japanese set, which had extras and commentaries on every movie,including this one - unfortunately that set, which came with a 1:1 scale 50s style Godzilla head, had no English subtitles or audio track.

It cost $1000 and I'm one of the insane people who bought one - if anyone is aware of translated versions of these movies' commentaries and extras, please say so.

Anyway, G versus M might be the single most-released Godzilla film - I suppose if it's remastered here in widescreen that's a plus, but if you're a fan you already own it and if you're anyone else just pick it up in the bargain bin in a few months.

From stomping on those puny Japanese humans to becoming Teddy Bear Christ for all mankind, thus being the biggest laughing stock in the science-fiction monster genre.

If ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" was a dreary coda to a long running lucrative franchise, then ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" was the low point of the original series that started nearly 30 years before. Unlike ""Final Wars"", which failed due to incompetent filmmaking, ""Megalon"" fails mostly because of circumstances around the picture. Indeed, ""Megalon"" is more forgiving than ""Final Wars"" since it was made during the time when the Japanese film industry was going through a financial crisis. Of course, that doesn't hide the fact that it is still a terrible movie.

Made in the span of several weeks, the rushed production shows: abysmal writing, ridiculous monster battles, overabundance of stock footage, a Godzilla suit that was as menacing as a Welsh Corgi and one of the worst-designed Godzilla foes of all time: a beetle with drill arms. The majority of the movie takes place in an open area, which is a dead giveaway that this movie was made with a low-budget. Even worse is that Godzilla plays second fiddle to a giant robot, which looks like a cross between a grinning Jack Nicholson and a reject from Ultraman. And the less said about Riichiro Manabe's music score, the better.

The monster destruction is every bit as ridiculous as the writing. Megalon's destruction of Tokyo is composed of nothing (and I mean, nothing) but stock footage from ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"", ""Invasion of Astro-Monster"", ""Destroy All Monsters"", ""War of the Gargantuas"", ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" and even ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"", reinforcing the image of Godzilla as a symbol of cheap, cinematic silliness and camp. When Megalon isn't doing that, he hops around like a mindless kangaroo and drills underground like a second-rate Baragon.

The climatic monster battle between Godzilla and Jet Jaguar vs. Megalon and Gigan descends the movie into even lower levels of silliness with Megalon circling Jet Jaguar until he gets dizzy and falls and Godzilla, a fire-breathing monster born from the H-bomb, afraid of a wall of fire. Then in one credulous scene that has to be seen to believe, Godzilla performs a running dropkick on one of his enemies.

Nor does it help the human actors have less personality than the cardboard props used in the movie. While in other Godzilla movies, the actors tried to make the writing material work, the acting in ""Megalon"" is astoundingly poor, even by B-movie standards. Nothing in the movie works.

Well, not true.

Unlike ""Final Wars"", which had no redeeming value, ""Megalon"" does have a couple of good points: the destruction of the dam by Megalon is well-executed, the car chase between Hiroshi and the Seatopia agents is mildly exciting, with an amusing end to the motorcycle rider and Gigan, one of the most interesting of all the post-1968 Godzilla foes, makes a return. But these are only a couple of good points in a movie besieged with so many negative ones.

That being said, though, ""Megalon"" is less of an example of creative bankruptcy and more of a victim of financial woes that inflicted the Japanese film industry at its time, which is why it's nowhere near as horrible as ""Final Wars"". ""Megalon"" is a terrible Godzilla movie and there are some bad ideas (like Jet Jaguar) but its deficiencies are more of the fault of the economy than the filmmakers.

Nevertheless, ""Megalon"" was the last time that Godzilla would be put in the creative dog house. After a string of embarrassing stinkers, Godzilla was pitted against his robotic counterpart, Mechagodzilla, in two more flawed but still entertaining sequels before Godzilla took a 9-year rest for his return in 1984.

Is ""Megalon"" one of the worst Godzilla movies ever made? Definitely. Yet, it should also be seen, especially in the Media Blasters DVD that should hopefully come out sometime this year, to illustrate just how downhill the series was going since ""Destroy All Monsters"" in 1968 and why Toho had to revamp the Big-G into a force of destruction in the 1980's. The days of defending children were over.

The time for Godzilla to wreck havoc on mankind and cause debate about nuclear powers was about to begin...again.

They may not be fighting each other like everyone wanted but instead they fight side by side.

May I remind people of 'Godzilla's Revenge'? When I got the 'Godzilla Collection' I watched all the films several times; Japanese version, US version and then again for the commentaries. I did this almost back-to-back as I'm a Godzilla nut...except when it came to 'Godzilla's Revenge'.

I found it boring, tedious and...I'll have to use the word 'tedious' again. Difficult to sit 'thru once, let alone several times. In fact, the audio commentary was a real joy to listen to, as it distracted me from the film.

'Godzilla vs Megalon' is a solid gold classic compared to that movie. It's fun and there's plenty going on. It's no 'Destroy All Monsters', but luckily it's no 'Godzilla's Revenge' either!

I will never understand Toho... first they're messing with the livelihood of a small business and second they're endlessly leading on the fans over what? A couple minor features for a children's film which is widely considered to be the least of the G-franchise films? Really? Funny thing is I've heard the commentary  (bought one of the few feature DVDs that slipped out) and it does not rip on the movie at all... the commentary acknowledges the movie's reputation and then states that rather than rip on it they will tell the interesting story of how it got made... which is exactly what they proceed to do. The commentators actually give it much more respect and serious treatment than anyone could rightly wish for. I would truly think Toho would be thrilled by the features so I am more mystified than ever at the studio's stubborn - if not outright hostile - position. Anyway, from the pattern that Media Blasters have set previously it looks as if they're going with limited no-features Blu-ray releases on GvM and DAM... and if we're lucky Toho might finally approve feature versions down the road a bit. Poor Media Blasters... I pity them being played with like this after making a valiant effort to put out quality product.

THIS INFO IS ACTUALLY FROM MARCH 22ND BUT IT GOT BY ME - HAD A BUSY SUMMER!

Media Blasters licensed both GODZILLA VS MEGALON and DESTROY ALL MONSTERS in 2011, with MEGALON initially planned for both DVD and Blu-ray last November. But after Toho complained about some of the extra features Media Blasters included on their DESTROY ALL MONSTERS discs, MEGALON was put on hold while Toho went over the bonus content prepared for that film.

Toho has a mountain of material -- including trailers, stills, publicity art, a feature length audio commentary by film historians Steve Ryfle (Japan's Favorite Mon-Star, BRINGING GODZILLA DOWN TO SIZE, ICONS OF SCI-FI: TOHO COLLECTION) and Stuart Galbraith IV (The Toho Studios Story, INVASION OF ASTRO-MONSTER DVD, TORA-SAN COLLECTOR'S SET), and an interview with English dub voice actor Ted Thomas -- to review, and the approval process has moved very slowly. With no end date in sight, Toho has authorized Media Blasters to release a barebones version of GODZILLA VS MEGALON at this time. A special edition is intended for both DVD and Blu-ray once Toho has given final approvals for the extra features, however long that may take.

ALRIGHT, SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT NEW TO MANY FANS, BUT WORTH ADDING TO THE FRONT OF THIS REVIEW FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW ALREADY. I'M KEEPING MY PRE-ORDER IN FOR THE BLURAY, AND FOR THE MEANTIME BOUGHT THE DVD ANYWAY. IT'S NICE TO HAVE A CLEAN COPY AND I WANT TO SUPPORT MEDIA BLASTERS HOWEVER POSSIBLE. KEEP THE FAITH!

This review is to try once more to stifle the negative rumours about this release. The previous review By Mr. Bearbomb ""DVD release RUMORS FALSE!!!"" written just recently on December 14th, 2011 is false itself. The DVD and Bluray ARE coming out, though obviously with a bit of a delay, as they were originally scheduled for before Christmas. The original rumour was reported early this year on August Ragone's blog - information being supplied to him by a source he thought was reliable. It then turned out to be false... the denial from Media Blasters came at this point in time, which pointed out that they had been denied rights to the movie (but that was several years prior, keep in mind). August reported and apologized for this. Apparently in this small and barely significant community of Kaiju (Japanese monster) fans / collectors, there is a faction who do not like Mr Ragone, for whatever reason, and it seems as if someone might have set him up for an embarrassing mistake. This kind of behavior is petty and shameful. Chances are ""Mr Bearbomb"" is one of the pack. Whatever, who cares. Ironically, however, upon hearing all this stupid furor over the false rumor, Media Blasters submitted a new request for rights to release Godzilla vs Megalon along with Destroy All Monsters, and were surprised that this time Toho agreed to the request. This is when the current release was scheduled. Destroy All Monsters came out after a couple delays and Megalon is set to follow very soon.

Anyone who still doubts can go visit Scifijapan.com and read interviews with respected Toho Kaiju film historians Steve Ryfle and Stuart Galbraith IV, discussing their involvement in the project (from Nov 15th, currently on page 3 of articles). Ed Godziszewski was also involved in at least preliminary stages of producing Megalon special features. They have authored books on the subject and been involved in previous DVD releases by Sony and Classic Media. The interviews with Steve and Stuart give interesting insight into the preparation of the commentary and more. Sorry, ""Mr Bearbomb,"" but you have no idea what you're talking about.

Finally, I'll take a general stab at this movies detractors who write it off as ""the worst Godzilla movie"" and other such nonsense. The bottom line here is that it's fun... just good old fashioned silliness! Now, as for the so-called ""good"" Kaiju movies... even the best of them are still about giant radioactive lizards, so give me a break, OK? It's true that the first wave, including Godzilla, Godzilla Raids Again, Rodan, Mothra, Varan were well crafted, interesting and fun monster sci-fi movies, with a small bit of genuine horror feeling to them, but with the notable exception of Godzilla vs Mothra in 64, things pretty much went straight downhill from there. from 1962's Godzilla vs King Kong through to 1975's Terror Of Mechagodzilla they were ALL silly. I mean, if you don't have a healthy appreciation of campy genre films (psychotronic fare for the more informed among us), then how can you really call yourself a Godzilla fan anyway??? The fact that Godzilla vs Megalon is the ""worst"" or ""most campy"" or ""silliest"" for me makes it one of the best. I just have an uproarious good time watching this movie, whatever the quality of the release. And the fact that it's now coming out in a 2-disc package with a well-researched commentary and additional supplementary features is the icing on the cake of my Kaiju collection. To h*** with the naysayers, I for one can't wait, and I encourage any casual Godzilla fans to grab this release, grab a seat on the couch with your kids and some popcorn, and have a great time! Cheers, everybody!

AUGUST 2013: Well I have certainly begun to feel that I would be dining on crow for this review of Godzilla vs. Megalon, but I have stubbornly hung in, not canceling my pre-order. I have also resisted the temptation to pay big money for one of the DVDs that 'slipped out' with features included, which I would so love to have because I am such a features nut. But I stay the course, hoping that Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters stays in business long enough to see this release through all the Toho silliness.

1178257,2,B0000039LU,"<strong>Godzilla vs. Megalon</strong> (Jan Fukuda, 1973)

If I recall correctly, <em>Godzilla vs. Megalon</em> was the second movie I ever saw in a theater. (Oddly, I am utterly convinced that we originally went to the theater to see <em>Gray Lady Down</em>, but that's impossible if IMDB is right about that movie's 1978 release date; the theater in which we saw them was in a sinkhole by that time.) It wasn't released in America until 1976, by which time I was a dedicated monster movie fan thanks to the good old Saturday afternoon creature feature on CBS and the Chilly Billy show, which I think ran on NBC late-night Fridays (Chilly Billy, for those of you unfamiliar with Pittsburgh lore, was Bill Cardille, who played a reporter in the original <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>, but I didn't know that for another five or six years). And I'd been a rabid fan of all media Japanese since Ultraman hit American shores. So this Godzilla business? Monster movies from Japan? Sign me up, baby! Now, as I mentioned, my memory here may be failing me, but I swear we actually went to see <em>Gray Lady Down</em>. Some of the kids were restive, so we (a) switched theaters to see <em>Godzilla vs. Megalon</em> instead and (b) since we'd missed the opening fifteen minutes or so of the movie, were allowed by the theater staff to hang around for the next screening without paying extra. Man, the things you could do in a movie theater in 1976! In any case, I was overjoyed by it, as I would expect any eight-year-old would be. I hadn't seen the movie again since, so I sat down to revisit it in 2011, thirty-five years after my first experience (coincidentally, on another blazing-hot summer day). To say the movie hasn't aged well would be... overly kind.

Plot: an undersea nation called Seatopia (you have to wonder if it was that idiotic in the original; both seeing it on the big screen and in the all-region DVD I was able to track down recently, it was dubbed), distressed at the surface-dwellers' nuclear testing, calls Megalon to destroy civilization. A couple of bumbling inventors, Goro (Katushiko Sasake, who seems to have appeared in a different role in each Godzilla movie that came out in the seventies) and Jinkawa (<em>Shinkansen Daibakuha</em>'s Yutaka Hayashi), along with Goro's criminally cute little brother Rokuro (<em>Dodes'ka-Den</em>'s Hiroyuki Kawase in his final big-screen appearance) find out what's going on when a couple of Seatopians raid Goro's lab in order to steal his most recent invention, a robot named Jet Jaguar. (That Jet Jaguar was an Ultraman rip-off was obvious to everyone who has ever seen the movie.) The Seatopians hope that they can learn to control Jet Jaguar and use him as a proxy when dealing with Megalon and Megalon's odd bounty-hunter-from-the-stars pal Gigan. So the heroes have to get Jet Jaguar back, get to Monster Island, and recruit Godzilla, who after all had previously made a career of doing exactly what Megalon was planning to do, and convince him to... save the world. Yep, save the world he had tried so many times to destroy.

Horrorbid, an online magazine dedicated to horror (obviously), recently ran an articled called ""the five worst big-screen adaptations of <em>Godzilla</em>"". <em>Godzilla vs. Megalon</em> ranks at #3, behind only the two ""reboots"" from 1998 and 2000. (For those of you who care, numbers 4 and 5, respectively, were <em>Godzilla's Revenge</em> and <em>Godzilla and Mothra Battle for the Earth</em>.) And let's face it, this is not the movie you (or I) remember from childhood. That could be because, as one IMDB reviewer notes, this is the only film in the entire Godzilla franchise that was specifically conceived, shot, and marketed to an audience of children. To say the filmmakers had no clue how to do that is an understatement, though to be fair we were all bowled over by it back in the seventies. But now I look at it and realize ""hey, these guys were treating us like... well, the idiots we were, I guess."" The writing is shoddy at best, the acting unintentionally comic. The special effects... well, better than in Godzilla 2000. (And I don't care what Horrorbid says, Megalon was cool.) But man, even in a series known for slapping the viewer in the face repeatedly with its ecological message, <em>Godzilla vs. Megalon</em> is over the top. And I think that's what really gets me about the franchise's thankfully-aborted attempt to crack the kids' market (which, of course, they already had); they felt they had to further dumb down an already dumbed-down message. Gah. That sort of thing drives me up the wall.

For nostalgics only, but that said, you might be better off letting your nostalgia continue to drive how you think about the movie. A rewatch might destroy your fond memories--take it from me. * ",1310947200,,4815,4.881418092909535

1178273,1,B0000039LU,"I'll give one thing positive about Godzilla Vs Megalon: It's only about 80 minutes long.

Either the writers hashed up the entire plot in less the time it takes to watch the movie, or a bunch of fifth-graders were given espressos as incentive to write this movie's script.

What I saw as the whole underlying cause for everything seemed to be that this civilization of sea-people was retaliating back at Japan for underground nuclear bomb testing. They go about doing this by summoning a giant beetle with drills for hands, Megalon. Once it reaches the surface it's supposed to... destroy whatever it sees fit (I'm sure a lot of thought went into this plan.). Who stands in their way? Well, they would be two uninteresting schmucks, someone's child (Really, I don't know whose child this is, unless the two guys are a gay couple, despite claiming to just be friends.), their super-advanced robot (It's never explained why they built the robot or what purpose the robot was supposed to serve.), and, of course, Godzilla (He shows up for a short time because the robot told him to.).

The progression of events lacks fluency or solid continuity. A new setting is brought up, while something happens, and it either just does not pertain to anything or stands unexplained. When explanations are given for some of these very arbitrary events, it's quite laughable.

In one case, while Megalon is being directed by the hijacked robot to Tokyo, it proceeds to annihilate a large dam. Does this have some sort of consequence? No, it does not. This part in the movie seems to be mere filler, just as Megalon finishes up there and skips along to Tokyo. Only then does it seem Megalon is doing something beneficial to the sea-peoples' cause, but along with the meandering plot, Megalon soon decides to wreck things outside the city again. These scenes may as well be watched in any order.

Then, there's the robot, Jet Jaguar. He grows to a size comparable to that of Megalon so that it can fight the monster...

Now, I accepted that this thing coexists with giant monsters. I'm not questioning the movie's understanding of reality. It's just that the robot WASN'T BUILT TO DO THIS.

When one of the schmucks was building the robot, he programmed it so that it could think for itself to survive. That's right, he gave the robot the ability to be sentient, if it had to. The main characters eventually notice that their robot increased in size tenfold. The other schmuck asks how this is possible, and the response he gets is this: THE ROBOT PROGRAMMED ITSELF TO GROW LARGER.

If that doesn't make it clear how brilliant the writing is in this movie, I'm not sure what will.

The action has little direction, even for a giant monster movie. Not only that, but the action is boring. What were supposed to be the most exciting moments in this film nearly put me to sleep.

tl;dr: I feel as if I shouldn't have paid a dollar for this at a pawn shop.",1279670400,,2934,4.657640232108317
1178274,4,B0000039LU,"When you purchase a Godzilla movie pre-1975, you have to know what you are getting into. Now, I'm a big Godzilla fan from the old days of 75 and back, but not to the degree of some people. Some people treat these like the STAR WARS series or LORD OF THE RINGS. I haven't even seen all of the 'Zilla flicks yet and I haven't seen any that were made in the last 10 years with the exception of some movie that looked like JURASSIC PARK: NEW YORK starring Matthew Broderick. I don't watch these flicks expecting to see some sort of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA epic or PULP FICTION type storyline.

It is what it is. A low budget, Japanese flick that let's your imagination wonder off a bit and sort of get into the character of Godzilla. Which is another beauty of these movies. You probably don't give a crap about the human characters, you only want to see Godzilla do his things, all the while making hilarious gestures or kicking some other monsters butt.

Which leads to Godzilla vs. Megalon. This has always been one of my favorites because you get everything in this one. Terrible acting (I mean TERRIBLE, there is at least 5 or 6 really bad directing and acting mistakes), awful special effects, hideous dubbing, an annoying little kid, the most comical car chase scene in the history of cinema, cursing, a hilarious fight scene, a mini bike the size of a coffee can, and a great little tune at the end of the movie. It is great for any Godzilla fan.",1206489600,2,1445,4.408239700374532

Sure this movie is cheesy, and the main characters couldn't be more stupid. Plus the military-on monster action is at it's best in this movie. That's all I have to say.",1195516800,,286,4.519230769230769
1178296,4,B0000039LU,"I do not know how to rate or categorize this movie.  I can attempt to describe it.

Cast of Characters:

*Young Scientist.  Creator of Jet Jaguar.

*Scientist's Happy-go-Lucky Buddy.

*Annoying Brat with Shrill Voice.

*The General.  Has thankless task of trying to defend Tokyo with an army of plastic tanks.

*Ruler of Seatopia, and his Goons.

*Megalon.  A giant cockroach monster, with wedges or drills instead of arms, a buzz-saw in his belly, and a Christmas tree star above his head which shoots laser beams.  Also spits balls out of his mouth which explode, sometimes.  Hobbies include smashing dams and bridges, and hopping like a bunny.

*Gigan.  A silly-looking monster from outer space.  Probably modeled on a fearsome creature of some kind, but most closely resembles a gigantic chicken or penguin.

*Jet Jaguar.  A silver robot who looks and moves like a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger.  Face is frozen into a wide mouthed grin which suggests insanity.

*Godzilla.  Our hero!

Synopsis:

I guess I'm not supposed to give too much away.  Vaguely: futuristic civilization targets Earth for destruction, resulting in giant monster free-for-all.

Lessons learned:

*Atomic testing is bad.  However we shouldn't worry whether it causes any trouble for undersea civilizations, because they are mean.

*If we should ever be attacked by a giant monster, Godzilla will gladly come to our assistance, provided the message is relayed to him in sign language by a shiny robot.

Other notes:

*The ruler of Seatopia (a highly advanced undersea civilization) is a bald, chubby white guy.  Also, he wears an outfit that looks like a bedsheet combined with a children's Halloween costume.  And I almost forgot the giant sideburns.

*You can always tell which giant monsters are the bad guys, because they do not have hands.  Instead they have hooks or, possibly, drills.  This has always made me wonder: how do they brush their teeth?  I would want to brush my teeth after I ate Tokyo.

*If this film is any guide, Japanese children sound and act exactly like the kids on the Barney the Dinosaur show.  This is a bad thing.

* ""Contact Star Hunter Universe M.  Inform them that we need Gigan immediately.""

*Giant monster sightings are very common in Japan, so common that when four of them rampage across the countryside destroying everything in their path, it does not arouse much interest.  In this case, the entire spectacle was only observed by three morons on a hillside.

*When Godzilla executes a flying kick, he is exceptionally graceful.  He appears as though he is being wheeled towards his target on an invisible stretcher.

*A well constructed robot can ""program itself"" to grow to hundreds of times its original size when circumstances call for it.  But it remains adorable and children will be eager to hug it.

*Giant monsters do not like atomic testing.  It gives them itchy skin.

*Gigan is a serious wuss.

The battles are nice and long and not that pathetic. But the only thing that makes me give this movie a three star rating, was because of that stupid Jet Jaguar!!! Jet Jaguar is sooooooo stupid! If he was in Godzilla Final Wars, I would have died! Anyway, it's a pretty good movie. A nice return for Gigan. Gigan and Megalon make a good team. Another thing that bothers me is Godzilla's suit! I mean, this is the worst suit Toho has ever made!!! But, other than that, I don't understand why people hate this movie so much. They should have put King Ghidorah in this movie though.

1178301,1,B0000039LU,"Regarded by many as the absolute worst entry in the Godzilla series, this film is pure cheese from start to finish. Of the ""so terrible, it's great"" variety, Godzilla and a goofy-looking robot called Jet Jaguar battle Megalon and Gigan (of ""Godzilla On Monster Island"" fame). The movie borrows most of its battle footage from ""Monster Island"" and other older Godzilla flicks and the big ""G"" is thrown in his corniest-looking costume yet. Absolutely pitful in an entertaining way.",1066089600,2,479,5.075949367088608
1178302,4,B0000039LU,"The concluding fight scene of this movie is truly not to be missed.  It is hilarious, wallowing in its own campiness.  The story itself is typical Godzilla fare.  Yet another nuclear test in the South Pacific bothers not only the inhabitants on Monster Island but convinces an underground kingdom called Seatopia to attack the earth by sending their monster Megalon to the surface.  Meanwhile, a scientist-type guy with an annoying little kid finds himself attacked by special envoys from Seatopia who are after his newly created robot Jet Jaguar.  They gain control of Jet Jaguar and use him to lead the otherwise ignorant Megalon to Japan.  Why Japan is singled out for attack is unclear since they certainly aren't responsible for the earth's continued nuclear tests.  The scientist, kid, and a brave buddy fight to regain control of Jet Jaguar and are naturally incorporated into the Japanese military action.  They succeed and send Jet Jaguar to fetch Godzilla; meanwhile, Seatopia sends a cosmos-gram requesting the help of Gigan.  In the end, you have Jet Jaguar and Godzilla teaming up against Megalon and Gigan.  Did I mention that Jet Jaguar somehow transforms himself into a gigantic monster-size robot?  The battle is hilarious.  The bad guys communicate in some kind of sign language, while Jet Jaguar and Godzilla shake hands and work together.  Godzilla even resorts to some dirty tactics, introducing a foreign object (a tree) into the melee at one point and later double-teaming Megalon--while Jet Jaguar holds the monster up, Godzilla pulls off the infamous flying-through-the-air-on-his-back-double-drop kick not once but twice.  This is better than watching professional wrestling.  I think Godzilla looks pretty good in this particular movie, as does Gigan.  Megalon is just silly-looking and is positively the dumbest monster Godzilla ever faced, and Jet Jaguar looks pretty much like a big robot, although his miraculous ability to giganticize himself is a concept only a Godzilla movie fan can accept.
As a movie in general, Godzilla vs Megalon is pretty bad.  As a Godzilla movie, it is rather campy yet highly entertaining and downright hilarious at times.",1017532800,,2182,5.224137931034483

1178314,3,B0000039LU,"Wow, this is probably the most ridiculously campy Godzilla movie of all time.  If you're one of those Godzilla haters who says the series is corny and the costumes look fake, at least if you were referring to this particular film I would have to agree with you.  Godzilla looks more comical than ever before, with a huge Barney like head and enormous eyes.  Megalon is a bizarre, goony looking monster, two traits that help make his cohort, a giant cyborg chicken, look cool but unfortunately falls flat when it comes to megalon.  Jet Jaguar is a humanoid robot that teams up with the Big-G to defeat the campy duo.  Among the characters is a small child who sounds like he's having a hernia whenever he talks.  Oh, back to megalon, when the planes are attacking him and he reached up with his claw to slap them down, you can easily see it's stock footage from the previous Godzilla film ""Godzilla vs Gigan"".
Ugh.

I like the Megalon folick, though. It reminds us that the story of a sunken continent with an advanced civilization (in Asian cultures the island of MU) is almost universal. The premise as that violence never solves anything. MU is being destroyed by nuclear tests so it unleashes its protector, Megalon, to stop the destruction. Godzilla comes to the rescue. Very ironic since the lizard was created from nuclear tests. The robot is interesting but unnecessary. Still it's a nice flick to watch on a rainy afternoon.",1011139200,,620,4.8584905660377355

Then a sciencist's machine, Jet Jaguar grows to the size of the two giant deamons, and begins to fight them. Godzilla, soon joins the fight, and helps the giant version of Jet Jaguar. With the power of Godzilla's fire breath and Jet Jaguar's laser beams, they are able to defeat Megalon and Gigan. The earth is safe once more. I don't know way it's called Godzilla vs. Megalon, because Godzilla mostly fights Gigan in the movie. The film also borrows scenes from the preveous film Godzilla vs. Gigan, with the two monsters fighting the same battle.

1178319,3,B0000039LU,"I must admit, I have fond memories of seeing ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" on television when I was a kid. Directed by Jun Fukuda, this is certainly one of the more colorful of the Godzilla films. But the questionable production values and overall campiness of the film make this a lesser entry in the Godzilla canon.
As the film opens, the undersea kingdom of Seatopia has been rocked by the nuclear testing conducted by the ground dwellers of earth. Seeking revenge, the Seatopian leader summons giant monster Megalon to wreak havoc on Japan. Godzilla must battle Megalon in order to defend humanity. But the monster battle turns into a four-monster match: space monster Gigan and a robot known as Jet Jaguar also join in the action.
Megalon and Gigan are two of Godzilla's cheesiest looking foes; compared to such classic monsters as the majestic Ghidorah and the elegant Mothra (seen in other Godzilla epics), these creatures are ridiculous. Megalon is an absurd mutant insect, and Gigan looks like a cybernetic chicken. The footage of the Seatopian kingdom is campy to the extreme. And Jet Jaguar looks like a children's toy. The serious issue of nuclear testing seems like an inappropriate plot device for such a generally silly film.
But if you don't take it too seriously, ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" is actually kind of fun. The presence of a child as one of the primary human characters indicates that this film is directed towards a younger audience, and the film should be evaluated on those terms. Jet Jaguar is an oddly appealing character, despite (or maybe because of?) his silly appearance. And the battle scenes are undeniably engaging. So shift your brain into slow gear and get ready to cheer on Godzilla.",988070400,4,1713,4.910344827586207

1178321,5,B0000039LU,"Many film critics are quick to dismiss ""Godzilla vs Megalon"" as B-Movie material. Perhaps the frequent inserts of stock footage from previous Godzilla films steered their latent enthusiasm into Guajardian rejection. Cynics can cite economical factors, but I see this use as stock footage as a counter to the notion that everything has a start and finish; the cyclical nature of hallucinogen creatures declares that the battle repeats itself. The battlefield returns, the wanderer unwillingly fights, and the battle does not truly end until a grinning robot and a giant nuclear monster shake hands, but only after eliminating the putrid anti-Kafka forces powered by the selfish whims of the protaga-subterfugerist. Godzilla's appearance as a creature, angry in face but friendly in action, gives anti-establishment causes great validation. Being that this film was produced in the early 1970s, perhaps this was a cry for us to come together as one planet once again, to unite as the age of Aquarius approaches.",986169600,7,1009,5.3125

The battle choreography is unimaginative. The plot is awful. The  script is even worse. The characters have about as much depth as the screen  their shown on. Adding more insult and injury to a movie already brimming  with both, Godzilla looks like something out of Sesame Street! It's not  quite as tedious and stock-footage driven as Godzilla's Revenge, but it's a  lot worse in all other respects. The campy humour may keep some engaged for  the first few minutes, but by the end, the only way to maintain sanity is  pondering how to murder Jun Fukuda.",966902400,,707,4.737704918032787

  This  movie was marketed for children at the time that Godzilla's momentum in  Japan was moving steadily towards its record low. Being marketed for  children, it has a flimsy story, stock footage, few buildings, gratuitous  pyrotechnics, and costumes ideal for television (Ultraman, Power Rangers).  It has enough action and requires just enough brain power to entertain  small children.
  In the United States, when people say how fake the  entire godzilla series is, the definition of godzilla series is this movie  and maybe some of its immediate antecedents. Obviously, if they have  written off the series as juvenile and commercial, the only reason they  would watch one of the movies is if it has plenty of action and requires  little brain power, thus not depriving them of the chance to make fun of  it.",956016000,,1010,4.993975903614458

The Godzilla suit  that they used in the film is probobly the ""cutest"" of all of the  series. He has a puppy like face with huge cute light brown eyes. His  dorsal spines that made him look scary in the original 1956 Godzilla movie  is all but lost here. They were sharp, jaggad, and uneven but 17 years  later they look soft, light, and puffy.
