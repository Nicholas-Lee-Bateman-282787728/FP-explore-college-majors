8369036,1,B002FG9NDM,"By the cartoon on the cover, it might be a dead giveaway that this DVD is a joke in terms of instruction. The title is ""Relaxation - Tai Chi"", which is what it is. The music and scenery are relaxation as well as watching the two men do tai chi. But don't even try to learn tai chi from this video, there are better ones out there, such as William Douglas' videos.

I do agree with others though that the product is misrepresented. While, technically no, is not a misrepresentation of Tai Chi, the company who made this clearly does not understand their audience. Most Americans have no clue what Tai Chi really is other than some graceful movement. And thus, most Americans would be purchasing a Tai Chi DVD not to relax, but to learn how to do Tai Chi.

The back of the DVD says, ""With this program, you will learn the inner of Tai Chi..."", which is what the DVD is (relaxation), although the way I learned first learned Tai Chi was first through the form (the choreographed movements) and then the ""inner"" came to me later. Had I watched this DVD prior to learning Tai Chi, it would have been lost on me.",1404518400,,1106,4.338164251207729
8369037,1,B002FG9NDM,"I agree with the other 2 reviews on here-- totally a misrepresentation of the description if you already know and have practiced tai chi maybe you could follow these guys but because I have NEVER done it I had trouble just following them. Also they face the camera so I got confused about which way to turn,etc.  Luckily I bought it at half price books so it wasn't a total drain on my wallet. I plan on keeping it for background music but that's all its good for-- don't waste your money.",1326672000,2,489,4.315217391304348
8369038,1,B002FG9NDM,"This DVD is a rip-off. There is absolutely no explanation, no verbal instruction, no how-to, nothing. All you get are two men (presumably) doing Tai Chi. One can't even tell if they started at the beginning, go in a proper order or end at the end. I know enough about Tai Chi to know that there is supposed to be a warm up; some stretching, loosening of the joints and so on before you begin but there is none of that shown. I guess one is supposed to mimic what they do, but if so, they could at least say ""Copy what these guys do."" or something. Even then, you would be skipping the warm-up. There is also plenty of pointless nature shots. Seriously, it is as if this was left in an unfinished state and released anyway. A total waste.",1313107200,,737,4.23404255319149
8369039,1,B002FG9NDM,"If I could return the Tai Chi: Passport to Health DVD I just purchased without losing half my purchase price because the only way a DVD can be veiwed is by taking it out of the cover and once you break the plastic sheeting, Amazon will only give you half the purchase price back....I would.  Although the video recorded scenes of various scenic natural locations and the background music is nice, but certainly not exceptional, the DVD was completely mis-represented in their product description.  The description from both the product page and the back of the DVD cover proclaims that one will learn Tai Chi, Tai Chi exercises and defensive moves.  However, pay attention to the ""Relaxation"" part of the title and forget thinking you will hear and see someone teaching you anything about Tai Chi.

The DVD is one of those programs you might put on in the background to keep your cat happy while you are gone from the house.  There is absolutely not a single word spoken during the entire hour.  The opening seqence shows two men performing a complete Tai Chi set in a beautiful forest setting.  After that, the scenes show lots of ocean waves, lakes, trees, etc. with the same men either standing still in various poses (this must be the exercise part) or cuts into the set mid-way then moves onto another scene.

If you want something to play on your TV as pleasant background while you work or relax, this DVD is for you.  But, if you are thinking, as I did, that you are going to learn from a Tai Chi teacher about the form as well as the self defence aspect, forget it.",1257292800,10,1574,4.53356890459364
