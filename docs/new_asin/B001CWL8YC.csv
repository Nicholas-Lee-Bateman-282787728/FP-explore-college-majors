It would have been a hassel to try to send it back as I could not find the correct address to return it, and make the trip to the crowded post office at Christmas time- so now I have two of the same DVD.  It wasn't until this review came on my e-mail that I could actually see which place had sent the wrong DVD as I did not know which one actually sent the wrong one- they were different names- but on my print out- it only gave the begining of the name- which is the same-- so now at least I can state my opinion on this- but I am still stuck with the DVD.  It wasn't operator (ME) error- as i found my papers and it clearly shows the proper way it should have been.",1293580800,,842,3.872093023255814
