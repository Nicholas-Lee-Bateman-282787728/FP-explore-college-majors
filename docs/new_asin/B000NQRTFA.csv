2778513,5,B000NQRTFA,"A True Shaw Brothers Classic. A young, over ambitious Kung Fu Expert, played by the late great Alexander Fu Sheng, travels to a town in China to find his brother played by Chi Qwan Chun who is quiet and reserved. Fu quickly gets into trouble and shows off his kung fu only to get hired by the boss who acts as if he cares so he gives Fu everything his hearts desires, wine woman and song plus a gold pocket watch that makes a beautiful chime.  His brother Chi wants no part of it as he has heard a secret conversation by the boss that He doesn't care if his own men live or die. By the way there being killed off by a rival cloth manufacture who doesn't like the competition.

The Martial arts gets better and better and the action is none stop. Fu Shen was a master at his young age with speed and great Martial Skill. If you like Shaw movies this one is a must have. This movie was also called the Invincible one A.K.A. Disciples Of Shaolin.",1180742400,,943,4.147540983606557

2778585,2,B000NQRTFA,"First of all the audio in this movie is horrible, not to say that these movies usually have great audio, but it sounds like it is being played in a small tunnel. Secondly the kung-fu is only decent, nothing really stands out about it. Overall I wasn't impressed by this one, no really great set pieces, no lavish costumes or make-up, nothing really noteworthy.",1398816000,2,360,4.640625

2778587,4,B000NQRTFA,"Director Chang Cheh (""5 Deadly Venoms"") and star, Alexander Fu Sheng (""Avenging Eagle"") cover territory previously explored by Cheh in ""The Boxer From Shantung"" (1972).  Apparently not content after this one, the two would later reunite for ""The Chinatown Kid"" (1977).  None are related except by theme and personnel.  This is my least favorite of the 3 but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, except Chi Kuan Chun (""Green Jade Statuette"") getting FAR too little fight time.

Fu Sheng plays Guan Feng Yi, who moves to the town of his martial brother, Wang Hon (Chun).  Guan Feng Yi is poor and gets offered a job in the textile mill that employs Wang Hon.  A Manchu-run rival mill across town is roughing up the workers but Wang Hon discourages Guan Feng Yi's involvement, even though both are trained fighters.  Eventually, Guan Feng Yi does fight, wastes just about all his boss's enemies, and gets quite the lucrative promotion, including a gold pocket watch (it was digital in ""Chinatown Kid"") and unlimited brothel access.  Is this a good thing or will it cost him his integrity and the friendship of Wang Hon?  Or perhaps his life?

If not compared to the other two movies, this is a pretty good old-school fu-flick, and I am perhaps biased, as I saw the other two first.  The fights won't blow anyone away but they're fast enough once Fu Sheng starts swingin'.  The brawls mostly stay on the Basher side but there are some genuine Hung-Gar moves shown as the fight choreographer is the great Lau Kar Leung (""Legend of the Drunken Master"").

Another stellar release from Image Entertainment.  I wish they had some special features but, whatever. On the plus side, there are LOADS of sweet Shaw Bros. trailers!  The remastering job by Celestial is fantastic, as usual.  In Mandarin with English subtitles or English dubbed, just as ALL Shaw Bros. movies released in the U.S. should be!  Oh, Spanish subtitles, too!  My copy of the DVD has a different cover than the one shown here but, to the best of my knowledge, it's the same release.  I'm not going to recommend this with a lot of zeal but fans of classic fu should be happy with it.

2778588,5,B000NQRTFA,A definite old school must see...learned white crane martial arts the left shaolin..that should be all you need to read to pick this movie.,1301356800,,139,4.833333333333333
2778589,4,B000NQRTFA,"The maestro director Chang Cheh remained in Taiwan for 1975 still making movies for his Chang Film Co. It wasn't a Shaw production per se, but it was affiliated with them. He started the year with ""Disciples of Shaolin"" (""The Invincible One"" in the U.S.). This period movie involved the friction between the Manchus and the Hans with Alexander Fu Sheng (as well as Chi Kuan Chun) kicking serious Manchu arse. Like Chang Cheh's earlier ""Boxer from Shantung"" and 1977's ""Chinatown Kid"" (also starring Fu Sheng), this is a rags-to-riches tale that shows how too much power and greed can corrupt even the most goodhearted. Chang's themes of morality, brotherhood and retribution are clearly at hand here. The scene where Fu Sheng has a final showdown with Chiang Tao is powerful stuff.

Actually, there are many powerful & emotional scenes here, and they don't all involve fu. Speaking of which, by 1975 the bar on choreography (done here by Lau Kar-Leung) was definitely raised on Chang's pictures, and it rarely dropped below that line from this point on. Good visuals, good kung fu. Great use of shoes & gold pocket watches representing higher echelon status to Fu Sheng. Image did another first-class job here; remastered, widescreen, and a choice between a decent English dub or the original Mandarin with good subtitles. Just as a note of interest, Johnny To remade this film in 1993 as ""The Barefooted Kid"", an acclaimed film that was also choreographed by Lau Kar-Leung.",1266364800,3,1474,4.943548387096774
2778590,4,B000NQRTFA,"Of the four reissues of Shaw Brothers movies with the late [Alexander] Fu Sheng to come out in 2009, ""Disciples of Shaolin"" may please his fans the most, especially if they felt burned by ""Brave Archer and His Mate"" (his role, not the roles done by ""Venoms"" and ""baby Venoms"").

This effort gets only four stars because the screenplay is highly derivative of Bruce Lee's ""The Big Boss"" (a little of ""On the Waterfront"", too? Chang Cheh DID like his Brando); otherwise, it's FIVE stars for the end product.... No spoilers here for newcomers!! With great fight choreography [by Lau Kar Leung], evocative photography and fine acting, it looks and feels [almost] like an ""A"" picture (""Heroes Two"" seems more like 1960's ""Batman"", by comparison).

From the opening credits onward, it's a Fu Sheng showcase that will please the men as much as the ladies; in some scenes, he comes off like Jackie Chan, and this is BEFORE Jackie became known of in Hong Kong, let alone the world! His performance here gives the best of David Chiang a run for its money, and this remark comes from someone who is partial to Chiang's work, so that's saying a lot. Also, let's not forget Chi Kuan-chi's part as Fu Sheng's older brother; if you liked him in ""Showdown at the Cottonmill"", you'll like his moves (as well as his acting) here. The [typical] great supporting cast helps keep things moving. The music cues add to the flavor, too; is some of this from ""blaxploitation"" movies?

Another decent Image DVD (nice new logo, guys) with English and Mandarin soundtracks (subtitles at your command), and add bonus points for the front cover of the case that looks like a comic book cover (""Master of Kung Fu"", maybe)! A must-have for Fu Sheng fans, and it would make for a good first stop in starting up a collection of the movies of ""Alexander the Great""!

All the best, Brother Fang.",1258070400,6,1859,4.675840978593272

8180947,3,B000NQRTFA,"This movie is dubbed in English.  The story is too simple, but the kung-fu choreography was well done.  Story is a guy comes to town in search of his friend in order to get a job and live.  He was broke with no shoes, but he had kung-fu.  His friend warned him not to show off his kung-fu in this town as it will only get him into trouble.  The company his friend worked in was a fabric weaving company, but there was a competitor who needed the same workers, so the competitor would use various trickeries to lure employees away including money and force.  To shield the company from losing their workers, they train their employees basic kung-fu.  So the new kid in town decided that he could be better used as a kung-fu master in the company and showed off his kung-fu that helped him rise with promotion after promotion.  Soon, he was able to have new shoes, new clothes, new home and his favorite, a new watch.  He was even offered a new girlfriend.  However, what goes up, must come down, so the competitor constantly challenged him until he lost it all with his life.  His friend then had to revenge for him even though his friend was very disappointed at how he just wanted more and more, and then lost it all.",1505779200,,1218,4.345132743362832
8180948,5,B000NQRTFA,Shaw brothers. Are the best kung fu movie? In the world. I love everything by Shaw Brothers. I remember in Houston. Unsettling afternoon and morning. It was so nice movies.

8180949,4,B000NQRTFA,"Named the Invincible One here in the US, Disciples of Shaolin follows the rise to power of a country bumpkin who happens to be a very capable kung fu artist (Fu Sheng) & its tragic consequences. Also in this film is Chi Kuan Chun who plays his friend who recommends him for a job at the textile mill. Slowly Fu Sheng moves up rapidly in the company, much against the urging of Chi Kuan Chun not to get involved in the company's power struggle with a rival business. The baddies in this one include Chiang Tao & Fung Hak On. Only 4 stars for me because it wasn't as action packed as your normal Chang Cheh fare.

Once again, Fu Sheng sells you on his role as the naive bumpkin which would cost him dearly. That too sours me on this film a bit. But his martial art skill is really at its tip top. Chi Kuan Chun, when forced into action, holds his own & then some. This is the movie that sent Fu Sheng's star skyrocketing & rightfully so. An absolute must for Fu Sheng fans as well as lovers of the kung fu genre.",1491955200,,1010,4.126903553299492
