3148409,5,B0015XL7SK,"This film is an insightful mix of personal accounts from those who knew Alice Neel, images of her work, and footage of the artist herself. I've seen countless documentaries on many artists - and this ranks among the best. Made by Neel's grandson, some older footage had to have been taken by his father, Neel's son. At the heart of this work is a desire to tell the honest, real account of Alice Neel's life. I especially liked how the well filmed interviews seemed to mirror those sessions Neel had when she painted her subjects. At times, hand held camera work and lighting from spotlights perhaps similar to those she would use helped increase a sense of connection with the interviewed sitter. New images of her paintings, often revealingly somewhat close-up, were very well filmed and integrated perfectly into the older historic footage to help point how her artworks are with us now in the present - always ever relevant. She was a wonderful artist and humanitarian.",1246060800,14,973,4.832335329341317
3148410,4,B0015XL7SK,"I looked up Alice Neel for a homework assignment for a painting class, and found her absolutely fascinating, her life story, and her paintings. The movie is great because it is made by her sons and grandson. It's quirky, but so is she. The great part is you find out what ever happened to Isabella, her daughter, who was taken to Cuba by her x-husband as a baby. I will let you find out for yourself. A great American Artist story. She is my new favorite.",1244073600,18,455,4.3023255813953485
3148411,5,B0015XL7SK,I saw this documentary in San Francisco at a movie theatre and loved it.  It is terrific to have my own copy and to be able to see Alice's paintings either on my large tv or smaller computer screens.,1231286400,8,199,4.102564102564102
3148412,4,B0015XL7SK,"I caught this at an early screening by the film department at the College of Santa Fe.  Neel had a unique ability to capture the essence of a person.  Unfortunately, she fell beneathe the radar of public notice in recent years.  The film drags a bit, but is a ""must see""  for anyone who cares about art and the true (not just representational) portrait of another human being.",1215302400,16,376,4.485294117647059
3148413,5,B0015XL7SK,This documentary shows the difference between the measurement of a man's art versus a woman's.  She could really connect with her subjects and translate that inner person onto a canvas.,1371340800,,185,5.166666666666667
3148414,5,B0015XL7SK,"terrific, and I think truthful, documentary about a wonderful artist who led a bizarre and troubled life.  Story told by her sons who had a tumultous and difficult childhood but apparently came out of it loving their mother and being very supportive./",1363824000,3,251,4.976190476190476
3148415,5,B0015XL7SK,"This was a fascinating film about an artist working in new York during the heyday of abstract expressionism.
Alice Neel lead a very unconventional life and crossed paths with many famous people of that time.
if you like art you will like this film.",1362787200,,248,4.659090909090909
3148416,5,B0015XL7SK,"Alice Neel was flamboyantly misunderstood during her lifetime. This film, by her grandson, Andrew, is a stellar attempt to redress that inequity. Alice was shunted to the back of the bus as a painter, but she was truly great.",1354060800,,225,4.794871794871795
3148417,5,B0015XL7SK,"I've looked for this video for quite some time.  Thanks, Amazon.  I've given the high rating because it is so interesting and well put together, and I learned some things from it also. I would recommend this to anyone interested in biographies or any artist. Thanks!",1353974400,,266,4.760869565217392
3148418,5,B0015XL7SK,"This film reveals both the Artist and her work in perfect balance.  Most of all it is INSPIRING, heart wrenching and warming. I love Alice, with all her faults and endearing qualities, but especially for the driven artist she is. (I say is because she will ever live through her work).",1349740800,2,285,4.588235294117647
3148419,5,B0015XL7SK,"I love this bio of Alice Neel. I've always loved her work, how she painted us as we are, the beauty of the whole with its shadows and losses and fears, our particularity. The film is wonderfully like the woman and her art. It's a straightforward biography pieced together out of old photos, paintings, and old and new interviews, in a sense leaving nothing out, whether it flatters Alice or not. There is a satisfying number of glimpses of Alice herself, whose blunt, perceptive talk and native clarity were leavened with humor and affection. I love her even more now than I did before, and I now also love her family, who are a testament to her truth as an individual--she did what mattered most to her, she was true to herself. That's so difficult to do, especially for women. She suffered for it, and others suffered for it, but who the hell said you could get out of suffering in this life? She did her time, she made the very best of her life, as ragged as life really is, and I love her for it.",1342656000,3,1000,4.352941176470588
3148420,4,B0015XL7SK,"Alice Neel, the film, is overall a worthy film to see, but director Neel needed to step back, let the personal issues evaporate, then really give a good and hard edit to this film. What could have been great ends up merely good. While a loss, very little produced in the arts fails as well as this film so bear that in mind through the frustrating moments. In this way, the film oddly recapitulates its subject's existence. Good for it, good for us, but for the filmmaker a mixed bag, as the film never recapitulates the complexity of its subject; as if it really could....",1340236800,,573,4.466666666666667
3148421,5,B0015XL7SK,"My first introduction to Alice Neel's work was at the show Alice Neel: Paintings 1933-1982 at Loyola Marymount. I knew very little of her life, but her art woke me. Through her eyes I began to see the colors. I looked at skin and saw the many colors that make up something as simple as skin tone. She blew up the color spectrum for me and taught me in one afternoon to see.  So often in life we see what we think we should see, Alice saw what was there, and then she saw through what was there to the essence of the person.  Her portraits were both reductive and complex.

This excellent documentary was a revelation. I learned a great deal about Alice Neel, her art, her life and her place in art history.  It is an unflinching look at Alice's life and art, and how they inform each other. Alice Neel holds a place in the iconography of American artists and this documentary will introduce you to her rare and steadfast visual genius.",1298764800,2,935,4.325714285714286
3148422,5,B0015XL7SK,"I saw this documentary at a friend's house, and plan to buy it as soon as it is available again.  My mother was the subject of two portraits by Neel--she was Hartley's visiting nurse in 1941--and neither portrait was acknowledged publicly for decades; the first, ""Woman in Blue Hat"", was ascribed to the wrong year and my mother was not identified by the gallery; the other, still unnamed, has been in our family's possession since it was done, and only recently (less than 20 years ago) did it come to the attention of the gallery then handling her work.
I realize this isn't much of a review, but I was thrilled to see the documentary and I believe my mother's portrait shows up hanging on the wall of Hartley's home during an interview recorded in the documentary.  So, yes, the documentary meant very much to me.  Neel may be history to many, but she is still living to me--and let my mother exist in history as well!",1256083200,9,921,4.502994011976048

8260333,5,B0015XL7SK,"I ordered this DVD in 11/2008 and watched it many times. My son watched it with me and enjoyed it very much, as he holds some of the same political ideas & leanings as Alice Neel did. In 2014 my niece, who was an Art teacher in Senegal noticed the DVD in my living room, and asked
me about the artist. I gave her the DVD because I wanted her,and possibly her students, to enjoy seeing Alice Neel's work.
Now she is in Mexico teaching. I hope the DVD has traveled from 1 part of the globe to the other. I want as many people as I can get to see
Alice Neel's work. I love the music, the narration by Alice Neel's grandson & son, and just being able to see  where she painted & those masterfully stirring portraits. I decided I must have another copy. The price has doubled but it's worth it to me.",1458604800,,795,4.063694267515924

8260335,5,B0015XL7SK,Alice Neel's grandson gives us an intimate and surprisingly honest look at the life of Alice Neel. It is intense and beautiful. I am a painter and when this was on Netflix I watched it over and over again. Although Alice was not an extremely theoretically driven painter her theories lie in her love of people and her own vulnerability as a woman. Most of us today who would work like this are laughed out of the galleries but it is nonetheless  fulfilling to catch a glimpse of someone who is so passionate about their work.,1423094400,,525,4.46875

8260339,5,B0015XL7SK,"I came away admiring the work of Alice Neel, whose name I did not know until reading an interview with essayist Jo Ann Beard. But I found it hard to watch some of the interview footage with her sons, one of whom was physically abused by Neel's second husband. Both sons may have been neglected; at the very least their welfare seems to have come second to Neel's art.",1375660800,,367,4.333333333333333
8260340,5,B0015XL7SK,"Ever since I saw her art over ten years ago, I was intrigued.  She was a very interesting and talented artist, who was born and lived way before her time.  Just to think she was born about the same time as my own grandmother. I could never imagine my grandmother or mother acting or being like Alice Neel. (They were and are old school.)  Alice Neel would fit very well into today's modern society.  Alice Neel was young even when she was elderly! This film is the perfect biography of her life and I highly recommend it.  It was very interesting.  It's worth watching again.  I also love painting and art, but not to the degree of Alice Neel.  Guess that's why she was so successful and still is even after her death!",1373932800,2,718,4.345864661654136
