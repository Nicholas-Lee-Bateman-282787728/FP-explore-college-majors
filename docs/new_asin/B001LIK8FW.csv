8318169,3,B001LIK8FW,"This movie is a sad edition to the Emanuelle series. The plot is terrible and the girl, although stunningly beautiful and sexy, is a terrible actress. This movie is fine to rent but don't buy unless you like the actress as much as I do.",1354579200,,236,4.266666666666667
8318170,4,B001LIK8FW,"In her one and only screen appearance (apparantly, proof that there is no God), the insanely voluptuous Sharon Lesley takes over the role of Emanuelle, who`s now confined to a Manhattan psychiatric clinic with an acute case of amnesia, depraved fantasies and Daddy-delusions of the highest order. Her doctor attempts to unravel a Freudian check-list of incestuous hunger, lesbian-longings, misplaced aggressions and errant nymphomania before her traumas take permanant hold. Sharon Lesley is a marvel to behold - a pretty face, gorgeous eyes, absolutely perfect natural breasts, a bubble-butt you could bounce a quarter off of, curvaceous to the Nth degree. AND she looks fantastic in the stylings of those wicked 70`s when she`s not naked - God Bless America. Hang on, I`m getting weepy... To top things off, she`s paired with EuroBeauties Danielle Elison and Dagmar Lassander, so things can`t possibly get much better on an exploitation level. Synapse has done a great job in re-introducing/remastering this flick, and we sleaze-hounds are forever indebted for this release...",1269388800,10,1078,5.4226190476190474
