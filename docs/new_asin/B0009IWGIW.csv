8061414,5,B0009IWGIW,"I have a 16 set I bought for $10. I love old black n white movies since I was a kid
back in the 70's. I still love them. I figured some of these would be good but I like
all of them. Some are great some okay but none are BAD. Of course the quality is not
perfect and they are cheaply made movies by small studios. If you remember old movies
on the late show that's the quailty. Pretty good. None are terrible. There are many
famous actors who started in these movies. The plots vary from film noir, bank robbers,
mob stories, and dragnet type movies with narration. If you like movies with good stories
and acting and not so worried about high tech quality special effects you'll love these.
The best of the movies is Big Combo with all star cast Cornell Wilde, Richard Conte,
Brian Dunleavy and young actors Lee Van Cleef and Earl Holloman! and quality is great.
Also Shoot to Kill which I've seen before on another set is also great. Highly recommended.",1312675200,3,955,4.311111111111111
8061415,3,B0009IWGIW,"Correct title for this ECHO BRIDGE set is MOBSTER CLASSICS Vol. 1.

EB superimposes a company logo on-screen at infrequent intervals. Dubs are of well-used celluloid, probably from antique 16mm TV broadcast prints. All here look fairly worn. Featured are movies not currently in wide circulation. Of especial interest is a now-archaic 1929 talkie that co-stars Carole Lombard.
