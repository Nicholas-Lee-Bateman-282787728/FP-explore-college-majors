4858335,5,B005QGW28Q,"This DVD set is definitely a must have for learning lomi lomi.  Tom and Donna take you step by step through every run on the front and back of the body and is very detailed.  I went to their workshop in Hawaii and when I got there, I already knew most of the runs just from watching these DVD's.  I researched many other sets and finally decided to go with these and I'm very glad that I did.  Hope you enjoy these DVD's as much as I did.  Aloha!!!",1360713600,,448,3.9887640449438204
4858336,5,B005QGW28Q,"I consider the set of Sacred Lomi DVDs to be a ""must have"" for anyone who is interested in Hawaiian culture and healing practices. The beautiful flowing strokes, and calming images of the ocean, and the dance-like movements of the therapist moved me to enroll in a workshop that changed my life. My wife has joined me on this beautiful journey of Aloha. We can not say ""Thank you!' enough to Tom and Donna for their work, Mahalo!",1317686400,5,429,4.512820512820513
4858337,5,B005QGW28Q,"ALOHA - I have been practicing Sacred Lomi with Tom & Donna for several years now and must say that these videos are a great tool for the Hawaiian Temple Style Lomi practicioner.  Wheither this is the first time witnessing this beautiful work or you are an experienced practicioner these DVD's are welcoming and inspiring.  This work is about caring for the heart & soul, to get in touch with your inner child and to be set free from the boundaries we create in our world.

4858338,5,B005QGW28Q,"I attended my first Sacred Lomi workshop on the Big Island of Hawaii in 2009.  I was intrigued with the way Tom demonstrated the runs on the back of the body and how they connected with waves of the ocean.  During practice I was elevated to a zone far above anything I ever imagined.  The spirit of aloha surrounded me during the workshop.  I wanted more of this spiritual experience and was delighted to learn that I could take home the Sacred Lomi DVD (Volume 1 Back of the Body) that includes images of Hawaii along with sound tracks of Hawaiian music.  Returning home and enjoying the DVD re-enforced how clear and thorough the instruction had been during the workshop.  I stay in contact with the Ohana (family of practitioners), have attended two more workshops, two retreats and look forward to to more retreats.  When Volume 2 (Front of the body) became available, I immediately purchased it. Recommend you get the DVDs,([...]),enroll in one of the workshops with Tom and Donna and take a journey that will change your life.  It changed my life and set my goals on a higher plane.  I am now in my 70's and feel younger and more energetic than I did in my 20's.

4858339,5,B005QGW28Q,I have taken several Lomi Lomi workshops from Tom Cochran and Donna Jason.  They were positively life changing.  When the DVD's came out I was so excited to revisit the training through these presentations.  The History of Lomi Lomi and the presentation of it is so  clear in this beautifully  produced instructional set. It is so appreciated.  I will review it many times as a fine tuning tool for my massage practice.,1317600000,,419,4.75
4858340,5,B005QGW28Q,"This two volume set is a must have for all massage therapists and Hawaiian culture lovers.  It clearly demonstrates the techniques, and the history of this beautiful technique.  The loving touch and spirituality also come through. Although this DVD set is no substitute for an actual hands on course--it is great as a reference for this modality. Mahalo to Tom and Donna for sharing such a beautiful technique!",1317513600,,410,5.014705882352941
4858341,5,B005QGW28Q,"This DVD set is a must have for Sacred Lomi practitioners! After taking a couple workshops with Tom and Donna, I needed a visual reference for technique. The DVDs thoroughly demonstrate all of the runs for front and back body, including point work, detailed face work and sheeting. Not only are these videos a great reference for technique, but I'm always left feeling inspired after watching them!",1317513600,5,398,4.955223880597015

8483356,5,B005QGW28Q,"This is a wonderfully detailed DVD set for lomi massage. I definitely still had some unanswered questions even after viewing these multiple times, but I suspect that that's intentional on the authors' part: You'll really need to study under an actual instructor and then use the DVDs as a reference point if you're going to fully understand and offer this beautiful work in the way it's intended. After attending a 3 day workshop, all the pieces came together, and I feel transformed;  these DVDs are absolutely worth having so you can refresh your memory repeatedly. I'm so grateful that Tom and Donna have dedicated the time and effort to share this on video. Learning lomi changed my massage practice, and I highly recommend attending a class if you're looking to save your hands and bring more love, respect, and positive energy into your work. I really can't adequately describe how spiritually rich this whole experience has been, seek it out for yourself; you won't regret it.",1468800000,,983,4.921686746987952
8483357,5,B005QGW28Q,"I am the CEO of Hawaiian Experience Spa in Scottsdale, Chandler, and Goodyear Arizona and use both of these DVD's as part of our internal lomi lomi training program for new massage therapists. We are known for our lomi lomi massages and it is very important to our business that all of our therapists are properly trained. We rely on SacredLomi's DVDs to help with this process.

These DVDs are professionally made and concisely show many of the basic lomi lomi runs as well as some more advanced techniques. I highly recommend them for any massage therapist with an interest in learning this incredible style of bodywork.",1462320000,,622,4.813084112149533

8483361,5,B005QGW28Q,"Next best thing to a hands on class (and better than some hands on classes). I cannot watch it enough. The only thing better than Tom Cochran video would be a session with me on the table. My practice has noticeable advanced due to this scared instruction, and practical techniques, and body mechanics.",1427846400,,302,4.716981132075472
8483362,2,B005QGW28Q,"I thought I'd try this set because it has such good reviews and I had misplaced the first DVD of a very nice set of three on Lomi Lomi by the Mondragon dou. However, I was immediately turned off by the therapist's weird and exaggerated breath noises, expressions, and dancing around. Instead of being about teaching Lomi Lomi, it was more about his performance. I don't know how one could relax getting that kind of massage. Try as I might to watch just for the learning, I admit my failure to do so. Clearly I'm in the minority though.",1421884800,4,536,4.424242424242424
8483363,5,B005QGW28Q,"If you are looking to learn lomi, then this is the video set you want!  I learned an entire routine of lomi massage, and I love using the techniques.  I am hoping to some day get certified, because these videos are so inspiring.  The videos do a great job at breaking down the routine, and how to do each technique!",1393200000,,315,4.216666666666667
