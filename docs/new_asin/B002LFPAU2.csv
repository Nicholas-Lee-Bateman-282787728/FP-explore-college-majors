3946531,2,B002LFPAU2,"My 3 year old loves Pahappahooey Island and all the characters, but I expected more of a Christian message from Joyce Meyer. Instead, the only reference to God is when Joyce Meyer's character (""Ms. Rubie"") tells the children they can face their fears because ""the Creator is with you and I am too"". Then the whole rest of the movie the kids talk about how Ms. Rubie is with them and how Ms. Rubie said they can face their fears when they ""do it afraid"". Nothing more about God. Joyce seems to replace God with her own character. While this is an entertaining movie, I'll be looking for something with more of a Christian message like Veggie Tales or some of the Max Lucado movies (GREAT cartoons and an excellent God-centric message) and I probably won't buy Joyce's stuff again.",1282435200,,779,4.571428571428571
3946532,5,B002LFPAU2,"My two kids, ages 6 and 10, thoroughly enjoyed watching Do It Afraid! and What About Me? the two DVDs featuring Joyce Meyer as Ruby the lioness. These are quality productions with good acting/puppeteering and excellent Christian messages.
My son, the ten year old, said it was fun to watch, not boring or babyish. Both my kids can't wait for more Pahappahooey Island DVDs. We all recommend these DVDs!",1267401600,3,401,4.826086956521739

8372869,5,B002LFPAU2,"This was a very cute and interesting video.  It is very encouraging and informative.  It gives a positive, faith-based message to help overcome fear.  I think even adults would benefit from it.  It was also very inexpensive and arrived right on time.",1404000000,,250,4.880952380952381

8372872,5,B002LFPAU2,"My 4 year old was scared to put her head under the water in swim class.  After watching ""Do it Afraid"", she decided she was going to ask God to help her to ""do it afraid!""  By the end of swim class not only had she put her head underwater, but she even went off the high dive. Great lesson!",1379376000,,290,3.816666666666667

8372875,5,B002LFPAU2,"I bought this for my 6year old daughter who is extremely afraid of everything - she thoroughly enjoyed this movie and she watched it repeatedly -several times, in a row.  I enjoy Joyce Meyers books and videos myself so it was a little disconcerting to hear her voice in a child's show but it did not ruin the show for me and definitely not for my daughter.",1299974400,2,356,4.313432835820896
