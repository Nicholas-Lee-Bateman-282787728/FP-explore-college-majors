2430730,5,B000BNX4YA,Just hoping the DVD of this final season will be coming out sometime soon.  Don't keep us hanging.,1204675200,16,98,4.444444444444445
2430731,5,B000BNX4YA,"I've seen every episode of season three of Once and Again.  The writers touch on so many important subjects in a way that just sucks you in.  You can't help but feel like you're part of the family.

When I watch this show it's bitter-sweet because it should have never been cancelled.  It is still one of my favorite shows of all times.

Buy all three seasons, grab a blanket, get comfortable and be ready to laugh, cry and feel things you thought you would never feel.  The only thing better than the writing is the acting.  You won't be disappointed!",1202256000,25,552,4.405940594059406
2430732,5,B000BNX4YA,"Season 3, particularly, the second half of the season was the best of this show. The writing was sharp, the actors really had a handle on their characters, the storylines were fresh and interesting. Unfortunately, the scheduling was iffy and ABC cancelled the show without truly giving it a chance. Those who got a chance to see season 3 of Once and Again have been waiting for a DVD release for 7 years. It's worth the wait!",1201824000,40,425,4.532467532467533
2430733,5,B000BNX4YA,"Ah. The third season of ""Once And Again"" is finally available. So much happened in this season, and it's a shame that it was the last for this wonderful series. Lily underwent a major career change, Rick and his friend Sam worked on a hotel redesign, Judy and Jake (and eventually Eli) are working together at what was once ""Phil's"" restaurant, and the kids (particularly Jessie and Grace) took center ""stage"" (as in school play) for much of the season. Oh, and let's not forget Susannah Thompson's Karen. She endures major depression, and just when she's starting to recover, a life-altering automobile accident happens, changing her world, and that of everyone around her. (She should have won an Emmy for that episode, titled ""Gardenia"", but in an incredible showing of shortsightedness, she wasn't even nominated.) So many storylines were put forward, and it's a shame that we never saw a fourth season, to see how they played out. I have the first two seasons, and the third season is the DVD release I have been looking forward to most of all.",1128556800,13,1049,4.801104972375691
2430745,5,B000BNX4YA,"I must admit that I only got into this series during the second half of the final season, due to watching Shane west in A Walk to remember. I fell in love with the series and bought the first and second season the day they came out on dvd, but still need to watch a couple episodes of the third season still. maybe amazon could help out by buyng the series and selling copies of the third season on dvd-rw or whatever it is called when something is only produced when someone ordered it. I am sure that many people would pay whatever it cost, in order to have a complete series.",1334361600,8,578,4.169642857142857
2430746,5,B000BNX4YA,"They've had years to deal with the licensing for this show. They had this slated for release. Then pull it scant months before release. How'd they not know that the rights were close to expiring? Frankly I didn't hear anything about 'rights' till 2007. A full year after it was supposed to be released. I think that they were going to release it and then right before launch. Someone brought up the whole Jessie story arc. I think that uber conservative parent company Disney pulled the plug. That's what I thought when I first heard about them pulling it. Then I too got caught up in the whole 'rights' discussion, but it's been 5 years! I'm beginning to think that my first instincts were right. Now I've already obtained S3. However, I've read that the official release had audio commentaries and I'd love to hear those. At this point I wished someone had nabbed one of those display copies we've all seen the pics of (with the front & back covers with the discs displayed). That person could've made a bundle burning copies of those! Frankly I'd of happily given them a few bones. As opposed to Disney. Shoot, they haven't made a good animated film since Walt died. IMHO - Walt would be ashamed of what his company has become. Since you clearly don't want anything to do with it. How about selling Lionsgate the rights?",1302998400,13,1323,4.586497890295359
2430747,5,B000BNX4YA,I purchased Season 1 & 2 and am frustrated that Season 3 has never been released.  Hopefully with Netflix the demand for the third season will build.

2430749,5,B000BNX4YA,"What is going on?  You took a good show off tv and now are making us wait for the 3rd season to be released.  It has been a few years now, and please, release this last season, it is over time, and I want to complete my collection, newer programs come out immediately, and we have to wait years for the better ones.  TV has really gone to pot!!!",1280102400,9,345,3.971014492753623

2430751,5,B000BNX4YA,"I've seen every episode of every season of Once and Again, and I loved it. It was the Grand Finale for this wonderful serie. Very interesting and we had and end and it was a very expected happy end. It's a must have to complete the serie.",1246665600,3,238,4.085106382978723
2430752,5,B000BNX4YA,"The worst thing about ONCE AND AGAIN getting cancelled was that it was getting better and better as it went along.  In my opinion, Season Two was better than Season One, and Season Three was better than Season Two.  One of the reason the show got so good was that Rick and Lily's families moved in together, following the marriage that ended Season Two.  The result was a host of great family story arcs.  The biggest change of all was the sudden ascendance of Evan Rachel Wood as one of the most compelling characters on the show.  In Seasons One and Two she had been very much in the background most of the time, but in Season Three she is given a major role.  We already knew that she had some typical teen problems as she struggled with anorexia.  In Season Three she struggles entering high school, finding ways to explore her many talents (Wood has a very fine singing voice, which is put on prominent display), finding new friends, and exploring her sexuality in surprising ways.  One of the biggest surprises is her increasingly intense relationship with a friend at school, played by Mischa Barton shortly before finding success on THE O.C.  One of the saddest things about the show ending was that we never got to see how Jessie and Katie's relationship would have played out, and especially how the family members would have reacted.  The irony was that Lily was concerned that Grace might be gay.  I loved the riskiness of dealing with a teen same-sex relationship.  The show was willing to take some risks.

I also very much enjoyed Grace's arcs in Season Three.  She is very much a flawed soul, racked by personal insecurities that cause her to make a string of unfortunate decisions.  She undermines Jessie's efforts to get a role in the school Shakespeare play and makes other lamentable decisions.  She also has an unfortunate emotional involvement with a teacher, played superbly by Eric Stoltz.  Though neither of them do anything wrong, they develop feelings for one another that can only be described as inappropriate.  The whole arc is handled tastefully (just as Jessie and Katie's relationship is) and you can feel the conflict they both experience.  Both of these relationships (Grace/Mr. Dimitri and Jessie/Katie) represent ONCE AND AGAIN at its best.

What I like about ONCE AND AGAIN is that it is a family drama that isn't, like the endless teen-oriented dramas on the WB and the CW.  You get shows like GOSSIP GIRL where the adults are thrown in almost as afterthoughts, or other shows where the adults behave in ways that are almost like you imagine teens think adults behave.  But ONCE AND AGAIN at no point, even in the arcs focusing on kids, feels like a teen drama.  The show also displays a rare intelligence in its writing.  The show does not often resort to clich or hackneyed story, and often had some nicely fresh arcs.

The only thing I really dislike about this series are the black and white ""asides,"" where character are interviewed away from the central action.  Sometimes these have a documentary feel.  Sometimes they have feel oddly disembodied, as if we have entered an astral plane of sorts.  Sometimes it feels like they are talking to a psychiatrist.  I just detest these digressions.  MY friend who is a huge ONCE AND AGAIN fan doesn't dislike them as much as I do, but agrees that they are exceedingly odd.  Interestingly, the one time these asides work is at the very end of the series finale, when the cast members are interviewed about their experience on the show and their feelings about it coming to an end.

It is absurd that Season Three has never been brought out on DVD and that Seasons One and Two are out of print.  I have only been able to see this show thanks to one of my closest friends who not only has Seasons One and Two on DVD but who has recorded all of Season Three.  If not for her, I would not have been able to see the entire series.  She has for years been checking over and again whether ONCE AND AGAIN will ever be released Season Three on DVD.  Frankly, I would like to own my own copies of all three seasons.  So now I'm hoping for the whole thing to be issued/reissued on DVD.  It is a shame that this fine show was cancelled prematurely.  Now it is a shame that it isn't available at all.  Except through the kindness of friends.",1244332800,14,4315,4.57496740547588

2430754,5,B000BNX4YA,"I've just begun re-watching Season One of Once and Again.  It confirms my original sense that this was by far the best series ever written for television.  The scripts, actors---everything about this series is authentic.  The fact that Season 3 has yet to be released on DVD is a sad commentary on the studios given the large amount of dreck that is being released daily on DVD.  Hopefully, Season 3 will someday see the light of day so that all of the show's fans can complete their collection. In the meantime, we'll have to live with taped copies.",1233014400,,550,4.581632653061225
2430755,5,B000BNX4YA,It is really disappointing to me that Once and Again is not even available in Australian outlets. At least we have Amazon :)I really love the strong characterisations and actors are so well cast. Off on holiday next week and have saved Series 2 to be watched while at the beach. Hopefully it won't be long before I can enjoy Series 3 again also.,1227916800,2,345,4.40625
2430756,5,B000BNX4YA,I really do not understand why Season 3 of Once and Again hasn't been released.  Can someone explain that to us?  There are plenty of us out there who want to purchase it.  This week I pulled out my Season 2 and watched a few shows and remembered (once and again) why I love this series so much.  There is so much crap on TV and in the movies today.  But this show was very special; so beautifully written and acted.  Please release Season 3 of Once and Again!!!!,1223683200,3,463,4.146067415730337
2430757,5,B000BNX4YA,"I think Disney Should license Once and Again to Lionsgate.  Perhaps Lionsgate will re-release the first 2 seasons, and release season 3, with the complete series on DVD!

2430759,5,B000BNX4YA,"Once and Again was a good show with quality writing & acting.  All three seasons were equally good. I faithfully followed the show throughout its run through the different night and time changes.  However, ABC canceled the show before it could get ""into a rhythm"" and capture a larger audience.  Now, they are doing an injustice to all of the loyal fans of the show by not releasing the third season.  Don't leave us in suspense. Please do all of the fans of this wonderful series a favor and release the third season so we can complete our sets!!",1218326400,6,547,4.494949494949495

Once and Again Season 3 - DVD release wanted.

It has been a very long time now that we all have been awaiting the release of the third season of Once and Again.
I can't believe that the company who detains the licence has the right to leave the viewers/customers STRANDED.
Once and Again is a faboulous story and like thousands of others I wish to purchase the final season of this serie to complete my collection.  It really does show how a production company has no respect for it's viewers/customers and how powerfull these people are when money is concerned.
Hopefully a respectful production company will come along and release this season for us, they will make us extremely happy and they will make money at the same time.

2430764,5,B000BNX4YA,"I have been waiting for the longest time for the last season of Once and Again to come out. What's the hold-up? The third season, along with parts of the first, is some of the best, most relevant TV I've seen. Too bad Once and Again came along in the era of mindless reality TV. I believe that's why it didn't last past three seasons, not to mention the fact that ABC moved the time slot around so many times I developed vertigo as a result. The cast was brilliant. I especially enjoyed the work of Susanna Thompson and Evan Rachel Wood. I miss the show to this day because it was actually representing what a lot of families in American society are now struggling with, the blending of broken families. Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz are masters of their craft and this TV show is the proof in the pudding.",1205452800,13,809,4.364238410596027

I love everything Amazon and they approach each new undertaking with a unique insight that yields them great rewards, even in this economy.  They thrive, even now.
