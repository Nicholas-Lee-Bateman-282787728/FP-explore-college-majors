Great piece
attention this DVD works with european dvd players.",1374278400,,119,4.714285714285714
508639,2,6302754356,"Routine gangster movie, with little logic . . .

Two handsome young man fight their way through cunning and murder to the top of the organized hierarchy in the city. There are no surprises and no charm. Crime first pays very well, and then it doesn't, in a sop to the moralists.",1343347200,,278,4.346153846153846
508640,5,6302754356,"One of the french noir greats. The french have this amazing gift of seriousness and tongue-in-cheek  spoof. Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo are a matched pair and two of Frances best actors of their era (film came out in 1970). They are natty and wear stylish Borsalino fedoras -male beauties of a bygone era. Borsalino is as close to ballet as a gangster film can get. There is a slow-motion fight scene early on between Delon and Belmondo may be the campiest, funnest, funniest self-effacing bit of acting and filming that you will ever see. The fight results in a male bonding  that is embarrassingly adolescent male and reminiscent of Mark Twain's  Huck and Tom.  Catherine Rouvel is the perfect siren and femme fatale. There are some other great french character actors. Add to this the immortal jazz score by Claude Bolling and you have the ultimate multimodal entertainment. But it is a gangster film: so violence is not spared; but it is is fabulously choreographed and much more instructive and self-mocking than gratuitous. These guys are gangsters after all. There are such people. It is always horrifying to know that sociopaths actually have fun doing with they do (think: The Godfather, Bonny and Clyde, Chinatown). Life is random, adventure, consumption and combat for them. They are the only people that matter in their world. All others are merely in the way. The closest American film in existential drift , though, that I can think of is The Big Sleep; and Borsalino is equally great it its own way.",1315872000,,1521,4.861003861003861
508641,5,6302754356,"I first saw this film when it was broadcast on the A&E cable network several years ago. Actually, I had to be away, so I videotaped it (VHS) and am glad I did because it is hard to find on VHS and those copies that are available are selling for much too much. Having a taped copy, even with the commercials that A&E inserted, is great because I can revisit this classic from time to time. Curiously, this film was released in France recently on DVD but is still not available here. That it is released abroad on DVD would suggest that it will be released here soon. Belmondo, whose physique was rivaled only by our own Charles Bronson (viz., ""Chato's Land""), gives a memorable performance which is often comical. His performance contrasts smartly with Delon's stoic persona in this film. The cinematography, period costumes for Belmondo and Delon (including the Borsalino hats, of course), and the beautiful music and locations are all a delight. Belmondo steals scene after scene from Delon. This is a showcase for his genius.",1287360000,4,1027,4.743016759776537
508642,5,6302754356,"This is one of the all-time fun French gangster films. I saw it in a cinema in Paris, but just try to find the DVD or videotape! I guess they're trying to increase its rarity value by foisting a much inferior film, Borsalino & Company, on Delon and Belmondo fans. Well, this is the genuine article, more Marseille than the real city, perhaps 60 years or so ago, so just enjoy the great dialogue and scenarios IF YOU EVER MANAGE TO GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS TAPE OR (BETTER) DVD.",1128816000,6,475,4.288888888888889
508643,5,6302754356,"The special emphasis in the customes , settings and musical backdrop makes of this work one of the more sincere tribute to the gangster films of the Hollywood fifties .

Belmondo and Delon meet in the screen for the first time . The script flies from Beverly to Marseille which represents in France what Sicilia to Italia . These two small - time hoodlums will be the focus for this notable and unforgettable issue which altogether with Le cercle rouge (Jean Pierre Melville) and the Sicilian clan (Henri Verneuil)cosntitute the most remarkable gangsters french films in the sixties  .

This movie well may ber the masterpiece of this outstanding french director - Jacques Deray - .

Try to get another film of him titled On ne meurt qui dos fois .",1097366400,3,748,4.687022900763359
508644,5,6302754356,"I can only endorse the preceding comments - the great acting, highly catchy soundtrack and the all round talent make this an unforgetable movie; and yes, it should only be seen with subtitles. Three things about this movie have stuck with me: the soundtrack [which I'm humming as I write this], the disposal of the last major threat to the climb to the top and the superb, darkly funny finale which starts when the Chief of Police invites The Lads in for a chat. I agree that it's a Thinking Persons movie, which is why its ""criminal"" that it hasn't been released yet on DVD!!",1084147200,6,576,4.495238095238095

original  music  and  French  language.  It  also  has  English  subtitles.  Must  be  played  on  a  multi-regional  DVD  player.  At  last

7830726,5,6302754356,"Delon and Belmondo bring their own special magic to a pretty ordinary story. Chutzpah, machismo, style - it doesn't feel like acting when these guys are doing their business. Claude Bolling's score is so right for the period and place. Unforgettable. You can't take the movie too seriously but that's what I like about it. It doesn't take itself too seriously.",1406678400,,360,4.918032786885246

7830728,1,6302754356,"Borsalino (Jacques Deray, 1970, 125)

My only puzzle is that Jean-Claude Carrire (of Buuel scenarist fame) should have been the major scenarist in this pseudo-funny, but actually vulgar, brutal yet trivial, licked and spittle-polished alta moda Alain Delon and Jean Paul Belmondo small Marseille gangster epos. Inexplicable!

7830730,1,6302754356,"This is a dubbed fake of the original, without the original music. Since the music is an essential part of the movie, this vhs version is not recommended.

The dvd available from Italy, however, is of excellent quality with the correct sound and can be played with the original French (or Italian) and English subtitles. It is much cheaper, and the difference in cost will almost pay for a universal dvd player (Orei BDP-M2). In this form, rated 5 stars!",1376438400,3,454,4.675
