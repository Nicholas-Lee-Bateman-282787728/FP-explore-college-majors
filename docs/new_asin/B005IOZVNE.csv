4709711,5,B005IOZVNE,Wide is the Gate is a very important revelation on what is taking place in the culture of American christianity.  It is the more important when one realizes that people in christianity are unaware of what is happening in the leadership's grasp of Biblical theology.  It's a revelation in that so few in christianity could ever have dreamed that such a thing could ever have happened...,1315699200,23,385,4.818181818181818
4709712,4,B005IOZVNE,"This is very informative and interesting and I am in agreement with much of it.  Having said that, one must remember, anytime you read or view something that covers one view without any interactive discussion, debate or comments from an opposing view, you must bear in mind that you cannot just take the producers/participants words as gospel and that is why this is a GREAT resource for a small group setting covering some of the current problematic worldviews of secularism, Christianity and the modern day church.",1404432000,2,516,5.0
4709713,5,B005IOZVNE,"Everyone should see this DVD! Over the years I have watched the sometimes subtle changes taking place in the churches and have wondered where it all began and where it is coming from. Now I know the whole story. From corrupted bible versions to doing away with crosses and pews, to changing the church to a worship center, it's all here. After watching this excellently done and informative DVD, you will be more aware and awake to all the things that are slipping in unawares into the church to completely change everything and every tradition to the new world religion and new age church, therefore transforming Christianity altogether. Show this DVD to everyone. If you were confused as to why and where all this is coming from, you will be more informed when you see this. Experts on new age religion will show you here. So glad I got this, and plan to get part 2 also! You need this information. The first rule in warfare is, know your enemy! Be alert, be vigilant, be sober, because your adversary is here. Expose him with the light of the truth, and warn others!",1399334400,5,1069,4.572916666666667
4709714,1,B005IOZVNE,"The deragatory charge ""Replacement Theology"" is only leveled by Dispesationalist. They hide their name, and masquerade as ""Traditional Christianity"" even though their Israel worshipping world view was created around 1900. Their founders are such deplorable men, they now hide their Dispensational roots out of shame and their natural need to deceive. They want us to look to Israel for leadership as the Roman Catholic Church and the UN Rebuild their sacrificial Temple and return us to the Dark Ages. Physical Israel and the Jews are not sacred cows. They may have rejected Christ and worshipped sacred cows, but that's no reason to put them on a petistool. Jesus treated them correctly. You may not agree if you are Jewish or you don't share God's worldview. Sorry bout your luck. Ya might want to rectify that.",1368230400,5,813,5.029629629629629
4709715,5,B005IOZVNE,Excellent book on understanding how the esoterics are trying  to stop God's plan for His believers and examines biblical views to clarify ones understanding of biblical truth in these last and evil days.,1361491200,4,203,5.151515151515151
4709716,5,B005IOZVNE,"This video commentary reveals how ""Christianity"" today is being led down the slippery slope of heritical teaching and is a warning for the things which are surely to come. Would recommend any serious true Christian to watch.",1359936000,3,224,5.081081081081081
4709717,5,B005IOZVNE,"This dvd should be a viewed by every Christian because it exposes many of the heretical trends of the present day church; it encourages Bible literacy; it gives an understandable history of present heresies; therefore, it enables a Christian to better discern.

I was lost in eastern religion for at least two decades and didn't get saved until I was 53; my past enables me to more easily see heresy than those who are unfamiliar with eastern thought. I tried a dozen religions and never found God. After sitting on the spiritual fence for about a decade, during a major life crisis, God revealed Himself to me. He didn't talk to me or something like the mystics of today speak of, but as I read through the entire Bible, I was given faith to believe and have been in that Way for the past 8 years.

If you call yourself a Christian and you are genuinely saved, then you ought to feel stirrings to read God's word. He gave us His word to REVEAL Himself to us--His attributes, His ways, His prescription regarding HOW He is to be worshiped.... The trend today is to worship as one pleases, that is not of the Bible. Remember, the title of this dvd is from some very frightening scripture in Matthew chapter 7, therein, Jesus told some who believed themselves to be true followers of His to depart from Him because He never knew them. Well He never knew them because they weren't walking the narrow way of faith, but the wide way of doing what was right in their own eyes and calling it worship.",1359244800,25,1493,4.465201465201465
4709718,5,B005IOZVNE,"This DVD is outstanding. Here are some of the topics covered:

1) The Counterfeit Church
2) Biblical Christianity
3) Christianized New-Age Spirituality
4) The Evolving Old New-Age to New-Age Christianized Mysticism

In these last days, do not allow Satan to deceive you. Contend for the faith based on the Holy Bible alone, every inerrant word of the bible.",1357948800,6,357,5.137931034482759
4709719,5,B005IOZVNE,"The Church is falling into apostasy as predicted in the scriptures. Wide is the Gate does an excellent job in exposing the deception that has crept in. Practices that people are embracing as Christian have their roots in eastern thought and New Age...You can't slap a Christian label on something that is so blatantly anti Christian. Wake up slumbering Christians..all that glitters is not gold. Watch this video and have your eyes opened before it's to late. Be a Berean and search the scriptures for yourself, not what some one tells you is the truth. Looking forward to volume 2.",1352764800,5,582,4.83
4709720,5,B005IOZVNE,"This is a must own for all believers.  After you watch it, you will know that this is something you need to share with your Bible study, with your friends and loved ones.  We are living in a perilous time.  These false brethren, these men and women, have crept in unnoticed, the wolves in sheep's clothing are among us.  We were warned, but many sheep are still in denial.  People are afraid to speak out, but it is the duty of every believer to name names, of course with great care.  (Romans 16:17-18)

Many of us have lost fellowship, as we have seen churches fall to this emergent, seeker friendly, contemplative, new age purpose drivel movements.  We have seen the Bible watered down into an atrocity called ""the Message"", that they call ""The Bible in Contemporary Language"".  ""America's pastor"" simply calls this new age monstrosity ""The Bible""...

Our gospel has become a societal one, the foolish message that is the power of God to save has been excised in the name of inclusion and sensitivity replaced with a watered down ineffective message.  The Bible is no longer the source of all truth, but feelings trump the Word, and experiences dictate subjective truth.

I give this five stars, but would add a plus if it were possible.

Caryl and her brethren do a great job on both DVD sets, I highly recommend it to anyone who is concerned with the direction their church or Bible study may be heading.  There are not many left willing to speak about these things.  You will not be sorry if you own these sets.",1344729600,15,1517,4.587360594795539
4709721,5,B005IOZVNE,"Every Christian whether layman or Pastor needs to see this DVD.  It is a must for keeping yourself and others informed about the deception that is here, and is  coming into the churches.  Wolves in sheep's clothing as the Bible says. The deception isn't coming folks, it is here already, and will continue to get worse.  Arm yourself with knowledge that comes from the Word of God, and this DVD will be very helpful to open your eyes also!!  Can't wait for the 2nd one to come out in summer of 2012, I already have mine on order!!",1321920000,16,530,4.36734693877551

8474901,5,B005IOZVNE,"This is long but worth the patience it takes to view it all. I did it in portions. Caryl explains the heresies of our day so simply that you enjoy listening to her and don't have to keep rewinding and listening again. Modern theologians and those living through some of the described practices give firsthand knowledge and lend credibility. I recommend it for all those who want to be informed of heresies creeping into our Christian faith. Good seller, no problems.",1417996800,3,466,4.765432098765432
