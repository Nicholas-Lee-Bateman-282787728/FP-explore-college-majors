5406290,5,B00AAGDMEK,My  wife like so many people is a real fan of Whitney Houston. It was one of her best and there will never be any more.,1365897600,,119,3.576923076923077
5406291,5,B00AAGDMEK,I really enjoyed this item and have others talking about buying it as well. This makes you remember why we loved her so much.,1365552000,2,125,4.25
5406292,4,B00AAGDMEK,"I was looking for them to show more of her singing, because she had a lot of songs and now is the time to display them.",1364169600,,119,3.6153846153846154
5406293,1,B00AAGDMEK,"This DVD was bullSHHH the description of its contents are a BLATANT LIE. I have never been more DISAPPOINTED or UPSET over a product. This piece of CRAP was suppose to be a wonderful gift for my beautifully sexii(yeah thats how I spell sexii shih!) wifey. Instead it was whatever number of minutes of pure MANURE. This DVD is sooooooooo F-ing bad I am running out of different ways to call it as it is the TRUE definition of EXCREMENT. WE LOVE YOU, WHITNEY HOUSTON but apprently the low-lives that made this DVD do not appreciate ANYTHING that the wonderful Whitney Houston has done. I hope this review is a HUGE help to STOP anyone who is a TRUE fan of Whitney from purchasing it. Believe it or not I usually NEVER write a review but this DVD warranted THIS REVIEW.",1363910400,16,766,4.439716312056738
5406294,4,B00AAGDMEK,Every product about Whitney makes me feel I know more about her than before.  She should still be here! Sad!,1362096000,,108,4.4
5406295,2,B00AAGDMEK,"The way this DVD is described in the review, sounded like there would actually be alot of interviews with Whitney Houston, and alot of unseen performances, and some actual new information about the woman behing the music.  Instead, we get commentary from 4 or 5 people supposedly in the music industry in some form or another, talking about Whitney, their personal take on her, their opinions about her relationship with Bobby Brown and her professional life!  Some of the information they share is not even accurate, especially with dates and timeframes relating to her albums, videos, and movies!!!! The stills on the back cover from performances and interviews, are not even included in this DVD, so it's also falsely advertises what is contained in the DVD with the packaging of this material!!!!!!  I'll be more careful the next time I want to purchase another DVD claiming to show her fans the Real Whitney Houston behind The Voice!!!!",1361923200,8,941,4.980891719745223
5406296,1,B00AAGDMEK,This DVD was very misleading. I was thinking it would be something really highlighting her career and achievements. It does talk about her career highs but like someone else stated it's a horrible version of an E True Hollywood story. If someone was going to do a DVD like this they should have included her friends. There was nothing new here and for the price it definitely was NOT worth it. I got swindled in my opinion. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM if you don't wanna be disappointed.,1360627200,16,480,4.465909090909091
5406297,3,B00AAGDMEK,"My expectations weren't all that high for this DVD. Most of the story is told like an ""E: True Hollywood Story"" would be, with bad narrative script, and too much focus on the drugs. Some good performances were highlighted, but I was expecting many more. A collection of performances they featured in full as DVD extras would've been nice. Some of the pictures are grainy, and even some of the performances aren't great quality. It seems the producers couldn't really afford the real top notch performances (like the ones from the Grammys) so they use a few lesser known, still great ones, and music videos to try to hide that fact. I'm not sure it's really worth $10, perhaps if it was $4.99 and on instant download it would be worth it. Overall, if you're really a big Whitney fan, and you want to hear more about her music then her drug use, I would look elsewhere.",1360195200,21,867,4.528662420382165

8549156,5,B00AAGDMEK,"I'm sorry but I thought this DVD on Whitney was brilliant. Others who posted reviews seem to have bad things to say .  Very good and true story on her life.  All the facts were true and she was who she was.  I do recommend this dvd.  If your a fan , this DVD is for .  What a talent.  It's to bad she still looks not with us",1487894400,,324,3.6231884057971016
8549157,5,B00AAGDMEK,Arrived in perfect condition and played well in DVD unit. Amazing insight on Whitney.,1477008000,,85,5.142857142857143

8549161,1,B00AAGDMEK,I finally saw this and yet again this leads you to believe that Bobby Brown was the cause of her downfall and the He introduced her to drugs. Sad. I love Whitney Houston music but just tell the truth geez! Are critics and the media afraid to say Whitney did drugs before she met Bobby. The video does have an insurmountable about of commentary and doesn't really highlight her career. I was expecting to see more of her videos and behind the scene footage instead it has clips of different videos and a few pictures of her. It's mostly commentary,1395532800,3,546,4.47
8549162,5,B00AAGDMEK,I love everything that Whitney Houston sings and every dvd that she has played in great singer she will be misses.,1387584000,,114,4.476190476190476
8549163,5,B00AAGDMEK,"Just loved the part that talks about Whitney!! I wish it had some performance, live online, of the greatest singer of all time!!! But, okay!!",1381104000,,141,4.68
8549164,1,B00AAGDMEK,"There are very few Whitney Houston documentaries that shine a positive light on her and is also well done. If you want to see an amazingly well done Whitney documentary made by fans for fans go to QUENCIEdot com and order For The Love of Whitney. There are reviews on the site from actual die hard Whitney fans who unfortunately wasted their money on other docs that do nothing but disrespect all that talent she has given to the world. I interviewed Whitney back in 1998 on MTV for a show called Fanatic, so there please know there was not just skill poured into FOR THE LOVE of WHITNEY but also lots of love. Check out the trailer on youtube or our fb page.",1379980800,,659,4.32258064516129
