4988189,5,B006H37PXY,"What can I say? The ""G"" in his name must mean ""Great!"" These four movies are a gem for those who enjoyed his movies and his acting. I have never known Edward G. Robinson to turn in a bad performance. His classic line ""You do it my way, see"" has become as famous as Alfonso Bedoya's classic line ""We don't need to show you any stinking badges!""
from the movie ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."" Although Edward G. Robinson never received an academy award for his acting, he did receive an Honorary Lifetime Achievement Award for his work. Many people thought that Edward G. Robinson was of Italian Heritage who managed to change his name for artistic reasons but he was actually of Russian-Jewish descendant who actually spoke fluent Yiddish.",1362787200,5,742,4.67175572519084

It all good DVD with clear pictures and clear and sound.
The quality acting and the dressing goes with the old days.",1361836800,10,201,4.05
4988191,4,B006H37PXY,Four classic films starring Edward G Robinson. Good quality prints and thus a bargain for the classic gangster film aficionado.,1360281600,,127,5.4
4988192,5,B006H37PXY,"Edward G. Robinson was treated like a king at Warner Bros. While Cagney and Bogart had to fight with Jack Warner to be in A-picturers Robinson was always given the cream of the crop. He always was given top directors, writers and actors to work with.  This assemblage of celluloid showcases his talent with three classic films and one thats just above average. ""Larceny Inc."" is a funny movie but it cannot compare to the other movies on this dic. The plot has Robinson and Broderick Crawford as two excons who open up a luggage shop next door to a bank. Their purpose is to drill a hole in the wall in their basement and take the money from the banks underground vault. Anthony Quinn is also in this film and surprizingly Robinson and Crawford are terrified of him. Look for a young Jackie Gleason in one scene as a soda jerk. The other comedy on this disc is the hilarious ""Little Giant"" with Mary Astor as Robinson's costar. In this comedy classic Robinson plays a beer baron who leaves Chicago to move to California and break into society. He meets a rich family that he thinks is on the level, but in reality they are bigger crooks than he is. Mary Astor plays the girl who loves him and finally sets him straight. Robinson delivers the line of the movie ( which contemporary audiences will find outrageously funny but would not have seemed so to audiences back then ) when he discovers the true nature of his new friends. Next is ""KId Galahad"" with Robinson, Bette Davis and a menacing Humphrey Bogart. It also stars newcomer Wayne Morris whose greatest achievement was in  becoming a decorated WWII hero. Robinson and Bogart are at each others throats as fight promoters trying to outdo each other by owning the next world champion boxer. The fight scenes in the ring are topnotch and gritty.  Robinson and Davis are great together and their scenes are touching. Finally there is ""Bullets or Ballots"" a straight forward gangster film with Robinson in top form as an undercover cop who infiltrates Barton Maclane and Bogarts gang. Joan Blondell is the love interest this time and she is tough,sassy and funny. She and Robinson compliment each other well. Barton Maclane for a change plays a gangster who has some morals. He does not approve of the way Bogart keeps bumping people off.  Bogart {fresh from playing Duke Mantee) is an immoral scowling deceitful gangster who doesn't trust anyone and is only interested in becoming boss no matter what it takes. This is a classic gangster film and it doesn't get any better than this. The picture and sound on all the movies is sharp and clear and all films come with trailers, cartoons and short subjects.  The outer packaging is great with a colored in shot from each movie on the front of the box.  The inside however leaves much to be desired.  Putting all four discs on one spindle is not the way these films should be treated.  Aside from this the set is well worth the price.",1347667200,28,2934,4.60727969348659

4988216,3,B006H37PXY,"Edward G. Robinson is the man everyone imitates.  That's so much the case that for someone like me his movies seem like caricatures.  Bogart some how doesn't strike me that way.  Turner did their usual exceptional job, but I just can't get into Mr. Robinson.",1488240000,,258,4.688888888888889

I'm not a cinephile or anything, so I can't speak to the objective quality of this particular release, I just know it was good enough for my old pops, so they're good enough in my book.",1487980800,,368,3.9864864864864864

4988243,5,B006H37PXY,"All four of the films contained in this set (Little Giant, Bullets Or Ballots, Kid Galahad, Larceny, Inc.) are classic example of quality filmmaking.
While there are many great Warner Bros. character actors in supporting roles it is most evident that Edward G. Robinson is in control of the action in every scene. All of the movies are directed with panache and a feel for entertaining. My favorite among these reel diamonds is the pre-code gem ""The Little Giant"". The basic plot of The Little Giant is Prohibition is ending and Robinson wants to join the 'elite class' of wealthy business men and he finds them to be just as crooked as he had been as a bootlegger. Timely then, timely today. The script contains many covert as well as overt satirical comments. One of the special ones for me was when an ex-gangster pal of Robinsons asks a waiter at a high class party for some good whiskey. The waiter offers him a specific bottle, the man drinks it, immediately spits it out and states, ""Your horse has diabetes."" (a urine test being a way of detecting that disease). Many complain about all four of the movies being stacked upon one spindle but as yet I never encountered a problem with this packaging. I simply treat the discs with a gentle hand. A fantastic set of fun!",1432080000,6,1275,4.5964912280701755

8498007,3,B006H37PXY,"TCM Greatest Classic Gangsters: Edward G. Robinson is not a great collection with the best of the directors and writers. It is a stretch to call this a collection of gangster movies. Between the ones played for laughs and the ones with Edward G as the good guy these are Gangster movies only that Edward G. Robinson is best known for his gangster roles. Recommendations: As a collection these four movies are not bad. Larceny Inc is funny and features some major and emerging star power. The rest are no less than ok. This is the first movie multi-pack I have watched where most of the movies are weak and only 1 excels. Still this is a good completer pack for collectors and some light movie watching for days when you want to keep it light.

This collect is also something of a letdown for the specials Of course all of the commentary is laudatory. Turners people seem never to have seen a bad movie. It was interesting to have them admit that the script for Little Giant was thrown together as was the movie in a matter of weeks. It was also of interest that this was a time when the movies were trying to tone done the ganger movie to fend off the coming of censorship. The rest of the movie introductions were the same vapid stuff and pretty much runs together. The Turner Night at the movies did not seem well chosen, but I admit to liking all of the cartoons. From the silly Dish Ran away with the Spoon to the early Porky Pig, I was tickled by them all.

I had no technical problems with any of the CD. Sound quality and picture quality had to have been as good or better than the original movie house experience.
The Little Giant  Edward G. as gang boss who sees the end of Prohibition as the end of the easy money. Retires to Florida and falls in with not so polite, polite society. Very weak comedy with about 3 laughs.
Bullets or Ballots  almost a full on Gangster classic. Humphrey Bogart all but steals the movie and Edward as the cop gone undercover. No idea why the word Ballots is in the title.
Kid Galahad  may not have been so hackneyed in its day. Betty Davis add major star power. Edward G as the fight promoter. I liked him in this role, but again not a gangster. Once again it is Humphrey Bogart who is the cheating heavy. His is about as sinister a portrayal as one may want to watch.

Larceny Inc. A true classic. Worthy of the comedy of early Alac Guiness. If you can get this set at a modest price, this movie alone is worth the rest of the set.",1497830400,2,2472,4.282655246252677
8498008,5,B006H37PXY,Great classic movies and the Warner night at the movies is a great feature. I enjoy that feature.,1494979200,,97,4.444444444444445
