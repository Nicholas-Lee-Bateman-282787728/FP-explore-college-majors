2550244,2,B000F3AAU2,Unfocused in story and content. Makes you wonder what the message was and why they filled frames with pointless shots.,1367107200,2,118,4.95
2550245,1,B000F3AAU2,"This movie is pretty boring, nothing happens. It lacks a plot, and the directing isn't artistic enough to compensate for the fact that they really didn't have anything to fill this movie with. Basically it's about some people living in Israel who for no particular reason are depressed and jaded. What ensues is scenes of angst, emotional distance, and corny existential ramblings. All of this happens behind a forcefully bleak atmosphere imposed by the director. Great.
You could buy or rent this movie, but you're better off throwing your money in the trash or burning it.",1344643200,5,574,4.989583333333333

Synopsis: The '95 Israeli film `Devarim' (meaning: memory of things) is the first of three by writer/director/actor Amos Gita, (followed by `Yom Yom' '98 and `Kadosh' '99) which comprise his City Trilogy. The story unfolds in contemporary Tel Aviv focusing on three disillusioned, thirty-something friends; Cesar (played by Assi Dayan, son of the legendary Moshe Dayan), a moderately successful photographer and woman chaser, Israel (Amos Schub), an underachieving pianist and Goldman (Amos Gita), your everyday Mama's boy. When Goldman's Father dies the three men wake up to the reality that life is temporary and death eventually awaits us all. Soon there life paths are laid bare in this onslaught of newly obtained self-awareness and how they have been spending their time and energy come into question.  Will they discover their path to fulfillment and meaning or are they doomed to continue just going through the motions?

Critique: On the back cover of the DVD case this film is described as a ""moody portrait of Israel's `lost generation'"" and indeed it is just that. There is a pervading feeling of oppression and futility here that is immediately discernible from the very first moment and continues unmercifully to the end. The story unfolds slowly, beginning one hot, sweltering summer's day in Tel Aviv where three men appear to live in a state of constant uncertainty, agitation and depression. Every word spoken, every action performed seems to be an automatic, unconscious response that is unconnected to personal thought or human emotion. They're just going through the motions of living while never partaking; working without experiencing a call to vocation, conversing without relating and having sex without loving. Theirs is a life of smoke and mirrors, as Goldman suggests in one pertinent conversation, the unconscious embracing of the ""little death"" in preparation for the ""big death"" to follow

What I personally found intriguing was the first hand insight the film provided into the mindset of the non-religious Jew living in a land trapped in a constant state of emergency. What must it be like to live in a land surrounded by militant enemies who want to destroy you? A place where military service is mandatory and death at the hands of a suicide bomber can happen at anytime. While the religious residents of Israel may be able to deal with the situation by a worldview that envisions it to be all a part of God's ultimate plan what about those without religious faith to cling to? Surely it must be akin to living in a pressure cooker and that concept of impending doom and futility exudes from this film.

 A fascinating subtext to the storyline was a rather long, philosophical discussion between Goldman and his Mother in the second half of the film. The conversation dealt with belief in God and atheism, suffering and death and finally personal freedom and the right to choose what one does with life. Goldman comes to the conclusion that committing suicide is the ultimate act one can perform to demonstrate that the individual can do with their life what they will. I found this to be a most revealing conclusion to come to by a non-religious Israeli who has spent his entire life in the shadow of Arabs making just that choice. For me that conversation provided an amazing glimpse into the psyche of the contemporary Israeli that made the film worth the time and effort.",1228953600,20,3448,5.008726003490401
8116831,2,B000F3AAU2,"This is a very old (the images were very grainy) and old-fashioned movie. The plot advances far too slowly and hardly anything happens. I enjoyed the few images of a Tel Aviv of the 1990s, but I found the movie far too centered on the existential dimension of the characters and devoid of any real dynamism.",1475539200,,307,4.5

8116833,3,B000F3AAU2,"I have watched a number of films by Amos Gitai, andI like his ironic observations of the characters portrayed in his stories. This film seems to be doing the same thing, but the references seem linked to a place and time for which I have little reference point (1980's/90's Israel), so I found the story hard to relate to. The focus is on a family and the different levels of loss and futility each person feels for different reasons: Infidelity, Divorce, Illness, or Trauma from surviving the Holocaust. In particular, three adult brothers philophize about joy, death, sex, and the purpose of life. Rather than a story with a plot, the movie is like watching people amble through life and make sense of its futility. Not exactly inspiring to me, or done in an artful way. I much prefer Gitai's works, ""Kadosh"", ""Kedma"", and his latest political piece, ""Rabin: The Last Day.""",1462492800,,875,4.7631578947368425

8116838,4,B000F3AAU2,"Depressing, excruciating camera work, nearly plotless, yet haunting and well executed. The title is untranslatable, since it could mean words or deeds, an ambiguity reflected in the seemingly random lives of some young Tel Avivans in the mid 90's. In fact, a pattern does emerge in the course of the film: alienation and deracination in a country sometimes stereotyped by its sense of community and attachment to the land. Devarim is perhaps Israel's first modern film, one that refuses to deal with the common themes associated with the Jewish state. Nevertheless the mis en scene is absolutely of that time and place. Tel Aviv is always there, particularly the bustle, the cafe's, and above all the beach, usually glimpsed through a window at sunset. The words are universal, the things are specific. I didn't enjoy the movie, but I was moved by it.",1440115200,,851,4.958041958041958
8116839,5,B000F3AAU2,"Amos Gitai presents a brutally honest portrait of the human condition, no matter where it is lived, or when. ""Devarim"" is not about Israel, or Jews, or Martians. It's about the challenge of leading a decent life. That so many Israelis descend from Jews who were persecuted by Christians and Moslems for over a thousand years is part of the ""flavor"" of being Israeli. That, and the fact that Jews are one of the few remnants of the ancient world who retain their religious-mythological world and refer to it, consciously and instinctively, in every thought and action. ""Devarim"" is neither hopeful nor hopeless. It's just how things are. But in Israel, as opposed to France, German, Italy, etc., what we see is not ""fancy.""",1426118400,,722,4.830645161290323
