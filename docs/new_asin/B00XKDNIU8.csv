7170689,4,B00XKDNIU8,"This is actually a combination review of three related Sophie Tucker projectsw from the same husband and wife. I'll post it in the three locations because it is intertwined. I hope yiu find this informative and Helpful.

One of the best known personalities of much of the 20th century, Sophie Tucker, was born before the disc phonograph record and the motion picture camera, and, of course, television. But with 60 years in show business before she died, at age 79 in 1966, she had appeared in all of these entertainment formats. Now, thanks to a couple of die-hard Tucker fans, her life is being told in all those formats and more. Susan and Lloyd Ecker learned about Tucker by attending a Bette Midler concert where Midler sang some of Tuckers hits and told some of her ribald jokes. (Tucker was a major influence on the careers of Midler, Madonna and even Lady Gaga.) They learned that Tucker preserved much of her own life in scrapbooks and collections of letters with Presidents, gangsters, royalty, movie stars and more and set out to visit at least 14 libraries and read (and copy) thousands of documents over a 40 year period. In 2009 they co-produced a terrific CD set  The Origins of the Red Hot Mama  for the Archeophone label which contained her earliest recordings (including 10 Edison wax cylinders) bound into a 75 page hardbound book. (Still a must in any collection).

In 2014 they decided to executive produce a 95 minute documentary on Tucker and hired William Gazecki to direct it. Using images from the scrapbooks, and interviews with folks like Tony Bennett, Michael Feinstein and Barbara Walters (whose dad owned the famous Latin Quarter nightclub) as well as the Eckers, the resulting film, The Outrageous Sophie Tucker, was created and has been playing film festivals this year. On August 11th it was to become available on video-on-demand but no physical DVD release is planned until at least the end of the year. Ive seen the film and I enjoyed it a lot. The creative use of the still photographs enlivens it and there are clips from her films, (she appeared in five) and TV appearances. At the same time the Eckers released a companion CD, The Outrageous Sophie Tucker Soundtrack (self released) with 16 full-length audio tracks which appear as excerpts in the film plus nine more recordings. The 67-minute CD comes with a graphically colorful 24-page book of photos and complete lyrics. Its a bit confusing because the CD tracks ( all from 1923 through 1954) are not presented chronologically and the lyrics are arranged in random order, as well. The composer, year of recording and location is provided but there is not even label info, so you often need to guess if this was a commercial recording or from radio or TV. But, wait, theres still more! Susan decided that Tuckers autobiography, Some of the Days, published in 1945 (and which Tucker would sell and sign at appearances for the next 20 years) was sanitized by the publisher. So, using the materials from the scrapbooks and letters, she wrote I Am Sophie Tucker: A Fictional Memoir (Prospecta Press), which, at 386 pages, is the first of three such books. My copy just arrived so I cant provide a review but Im really impressed by all the gorgeous color images throughout. As if this wasn't enough the Eckers made the book available as an enhanced version, complete with both audio and video clips. (Some of these are not directly related to Tucker but persons mentioned in the book.) And next to come is a musical based on Tuckers life and a Hollywood film version of that musical. Ambitious plans for sure. When Americans were recently polled to respond to the name Sophie, 75% said Tucker. Its just that, until now she has not be given her due.

7170690,1,B00XKDNIU8,Major disappointment. It's an exercise on how not to make a documentary. Some interesting film clips though,1444176000,8,107,5.352941176470588
7170691,4,B00XKDNIU8,"All my life I heard about Sophie Tucker.  I saw her a few times on Ed Sullivan.  Yet, I didn't know much about her.  This film filled me in and was entertaining.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I had the feeling that this was not definitive Sophie Tucker biography.",1444176000,2,267,4.176470588235294
7170692,4,B00XKDNIU8,"I enjoyed this documentary. I knew only her songs so far. I would have love to get more information about her black-face experience though.
I recommend it!",1439683200,,155,4.777777777777778
7170693,2,B00XKDNIU8,"I'm glad I saw this for all the archival footage and photos, but Tucker -- and her contemporaries, and her milieu -- deserve a much better doc than this. It's as much a vanity (and I do mean vanity) project for the husband and wife team who produced it as it is a doc about Tucker. They appear through the whole thing as talking heads, acting like they're experts, which they most certainly ain't. Meanwhile they interviewed a host of old-time performers who actually knew Tucker and have things to say about her -- but they only appear in seconds-long clips at the final credits! Now *that's* outrageous. Amateurish, disorganized, ill-informed, at times downright misinformed, and annoying every time the two producers open their mouths.",1439424000,10,738,4.912
7170694,5,B00XKDNIU8,"I had heard the name of Sophie Tucker for years but never really knew anything about her.  This was a fascinating biography of a unique entertainer who was certainly ahead of her time.  The photos and videos from her life as well as the personal interviews with those who knew her were very interesting and give a very well rounded version of this talented and canny woman who was famous for most of her life and was still performing at 80. It was neat that even though she was far from being a beauty, she created her own style during a time when most woman received acclaim only for their looks.  Right on Sophie",1493856000,,614,4.368421052631579
7170695,5,B00XKDNIU8,I only knew the name Sophie Tucker from having seen Chicago a number of times. This was a brilliant window it to what it meant to be a vaudeville star.,1490832000,,151,4.066666666666666

7170699,3,B00XKDNIU8,"Since she was on Ed Sullivan every year, how about a DVD of those performances. What about it SOFA (they own the Sullivan archive) ? Instead of those Beatles and Elvis shows you keep re-releasing every 5 years, do something different. I know a little about the Brenda Lee story and it would have been great if they let Brenda tell the whole thing. By the way, they also got the year wrong on that one. It was 1963, not 1961. Makes you wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the documentary.",1486339200,,492,4.301075268817204
7170700,5,B00XKDNIU8,"Such an amazing woman.  I knew of her as an entertainer.  I hadn't  known what a brilliant business woman she was, nor how she actually  ""created"" her own stardom- without the benefit of  all the connections and groomers of modern show business.  In her day no one talked about a glass ceiling- but it wouldn't have mattered to Sophie if they had.  She didn't let anything stop her.  Modern women who term themselves feminists could learn a lot from her example.  She didn't protest- She just DID.  What a woman.

There's a lot of interesting history here in addition to the information about Sophie.  The bootleggers and gangsters owned and ran the nightclubs, so of course the entertainers knew them.  It's an interesting and colorful period.  In a time when women like Sophie didn't have a chance, she ignored the odds.  Her determination and brains, and talent, overcame it all.",1486252800,3,882,4.786666666666667

7170739,2,B00XKDNIU8,"The title states ""outrageous"" but there is limited detail on how she developed the outrageous personae she became or who she outraged.
I totally concur with the other reviewers on this being a vanity project for the spousal directors.  If Bette Midler is such a part of their extended family as they refer to her - then why was she not interviewed for this film on Tucker's influence....?  There is little to nothing on the blue jokes Sophie told in her act.  They could have had Bruce Vilanch (who has written for Bette and was a great influence on incorporating her 'Soph' personae) address this, but rather they just have footage of his speaking of seeing her as a child with his parents in Miami and that's it.  Some of the facts are interesting i.e.  I had no idea on her intimate relationships with women, but other then that I was left wanting much, much more - especially since they apparently had access to -  and met the celebrities they did whom had worked with her etc.",1455926400,6,981,4.5141242937853105

7170745,3,B00XKDNIU8,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a pretty lame documentary...and a woeful exercise in self-indulgence on behalf of the producers. BUT - until a better documentary is released - it's the best available. Perhaps the American Masters series will take a hint. And perhaps (fingers crossed!) it may prompt Sepia (or some other specialty company) to release Sophie's wonderful Mercury LP's from the 50's on CD. They really represent her at her very best and (to my knowledge) they've never been transferred to CD.",1451260800,2,519,5.046511627906977

7170747,2,B00XKDNIU8,"Sadly this documentary does not tell the complete story of Sophie Tucker.  You would never know that she was actually a comedienne who would tell dirty jokes (none of those are shown or mentioned).  Most of the lengthy interviews are from the husband and wife team directors (their agenda is obvious).  There are a few celebrity interviews such as Barbra Walters (who has nothing remotely interesting to say).  In the beginning they show one of Bette Midler's early performances as she is doing her Sophie Tucker routine but Midler herself was never interviewed.  It is also appalling the directors refer to Sophie's only son (her only child), Bert, as a ""loser"".  They go out of their way of proving their theory as if they have some personal vendetta against Bert (it's quite nauseating) [BTW syphilis was very common in those days and certainly doesn't make someone a ""loser""].  At least we get some archival footage (there isn't much left of Sophie's performances, sadly enough) along with photos from Sophie's original scrapbooks.  Sophie had many struggles throughout her life, but you wouldn't know it from this over glowing documentary.  The documentary glossies over her abandonment of her only son (he was already in young adulthood when she became reacquainted with him).  Sophie was one of the first women to joke and talk about sex during a time when it was very scandalous.  She was a great performer.",1449964800,3,1415,4.953389830508475

Reminds me of that motivational saying that, ""You lose 100% of the shots that you don't take,"" and how Tucker was not in the habit of bypassing opportunities.  Like any multi-decade icon it takes multiple angles to hold that positioning; she had to have talent, hard work ethic, business savvy, ongoing drive, work well with others, and willingness to adapt to changing times/mediums.

Seems like she's a conscientious prototype for what now gets called body positivity and fat acceptance.  Her scrapbooks and address book foreshadowed social media's unwritten rule that it didn't happen without keeping documenting evidence.  Tucker's foresight into ad space celebrating holiday greetings, trademark fashion piece of hers being a handkerchief, steep wardrobe and hairdo budget, celebrity endorsement advertising, personal correspondences, autographing books, and whatever else showed a genius mind for maintaining her spotlight.  Bravo, she did the things others only dare dream about.",1497484800,,1015,5.644736842105263

8716158,5,B00XKDNIU8,"I really enjoyed this, the music was great, the story telling was great, all in all, funny and poignant.  My only criticisms:
1.  I bet some great stuff was left on the cutting room floor, as hinted at in the little clips at the end (I think Kaye Ballard's corsage story was very funny!  At least as good as Carol Channing's nosh routine).  I would have loved to have heard some of Sophie's more saucy bits and more interviews about how that went over.  2. The animated photos were technically impressive, but sort of visual one-liners that seemed like Monty Python incursions. Given the rich archive of still and film images the filmmakers had, not really necessary to have all those tricks.",1494633600,4,692,4.639344262295082

Well, she hawked those books and made money from them when she signed them for fans - so there are a lot of them floating around.

The memoirs are fascinating. It may be that the reader will not find her character endearing. I think in these politically correct days, she looks less than exemplary when it comes to relating to some ordinary people. Then there was the fact that she left her baby behind and sought success without him. But those were different days - she had a burning ambition. She trusted her family. She felt, 'I will send money and that will be enough.' I'm guessing that was the rationale. I don't remember how she reasoned that this would be good for her child, but she did.

This documentary show that when she related to extraordinary people, she gave much more effort. I know the filmmakers didn't intend to portray her as a lonely person but that is the feeling I got from watching this. As lives go, she had a good one.

When Tony Bennett goes someday, as he will, as we all do, that will be a story and another documentary worth watching. I am not surprised he knew her. He knows everybody!",1494115200,,1300,4.363636363636363
