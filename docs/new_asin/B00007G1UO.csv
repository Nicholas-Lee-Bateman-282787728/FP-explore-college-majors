CONTENTS:

From behind the ""Iron Curtain"" comes the FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS. The plot of this cooperatively produced Polish and East German sci-fier was reworked for U.S. audiences. In the American version, a magnetic spool is found at a construction site. When it's learned the spool originated from Venus, an expedition is sent to that mysterious planet.

STAR ODYSSEY is a strange no-budget Italian-made ""epic"" about an invasion of Earth by an evil overlord and his army of robotic slaves. Cheap sets, bad acting and a crummy script make this one negatively memorable.

THEY CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE-- Meteorites crashing into a British field form a giant letter ""V."" Scientists investigating this strange event are possessed by an unknown force, while locals die from a ""crimson plague"" that covers their bodies in blood droplets. Good premise, poorly executed.

The folks who brought you ""Star Odyssey"" present its predecesssor, WAR OF THE ROBOTS. Same lousy sets, an annoyingly familiar cast and frumunda cheese dialogue add nothing to this ""classic"" little story of an abduction by aliens and the mission from Earth sent to the rescue.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.
