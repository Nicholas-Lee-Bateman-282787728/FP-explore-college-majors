The Faker. A man is casting a picture and wants a girl who can sing and dance. The theater has dancing and two comics. A man and a woman talk. A woman dances, another sings. Mr. Martin talks to Ida Morton; she has talent. One man tells another there will be a murder that night. A woman complains to a man because he doesnt have a job and spends time with other women. He laughs at her. She threatens him with a pistol, there is a struggle. She falls. The man continues to ruin girls. What will be his fate? Four shots.

The Killer. A person receives a note, just ten minutes to live! The woman had a dream of her dead mother. Why has this girl been put on the spot? They tell of a deaf mute formerly an actor who could pick any lock. They show traffic on the street of a big city with elevated train tracks.  She arrived at that house, then received a letter. Her boy friend arrives. Another man watches them. That deaf mute converses with notes. Miss Letha Watkins receives a written message. Elsewhere a man received a warning message about being captured. The police were told to surround a house in Westchester where they found the body of Miss Evans. Later a couple rides a train to their destination.

The varying quality of the sound and picture detract from this story. Its value is the scenes from that era, which is not enough to make this worth watching. This story was taken from the short stories in Harlem After Midnight by Oscar Micheaux.",1489622400,,1486,4.353790613718411
8326657,2,B001NFNSU0,"Folks, Oscar Micheaux is revered as a pioneer Black director/producer/screenplay writer, but even by the standards of his time, his films left (and leaves) much to be desired. This is an early mystery taking place in a cabaret. Pretty weak stuff this time around. The dialogue is bad and the flashbacks are confusing in the extreme. Very badly edited. There are a few interesting song and comedy interludes by some undistinguished singers and chorus girls, but perhaps the most interesting is the comedy routine from a blackfaced duo (note-these are actually Black men in blackface, which was not uncommon among Black comedians at the time) named George and Gabby. Pretty standard vaudeville jokebook stuff and some song and dance to boot, but with an intriguing gag about Marcus Garvey (as well as others about Booker T. Washington and Frederick Douglass). In short, don't bother if you're not into watching films for historical interest.",1272326400,3,939,5.143790849673203
