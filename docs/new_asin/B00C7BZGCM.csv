8577990,4,B00C7BZGCM,some of these films are ok for Sabbath sometimes they seem a bit worldly so they can relate to non Christians but then can inspire and evangelise them too-so if that's what you need that's cool and also shows hopefulness of maybe how evangelism can help and be done..forgot some of these plots but we're pretty good films all of them I think ok to collect for Sabbath viewing like I say the different ones in series-maybe look for sample online youtube if on there or billy graham movie site to see what are like first and if sounds/looks good then get it cuz good to see more than once maybe if like,1432252800,,600,4.31858407079646
