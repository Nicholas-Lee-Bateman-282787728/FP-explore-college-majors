902906,5,6304556845,"The film runs with astonishing intensity, with verycredible characters, very well written and solid script that will catch your attention.

Obviously there are certain codes that maintain the whole interest in the film. There are certain thieves who still believe in the word: loyaly and honesty, and this is not a cynical expression.

So in this state of things you can look behind through the time, essential and related films: here I go: Point blank, Reservoir dogs( the best film noir of the nineties in USA),Le cercle rouge and Rififi. Four astonishing and crucial films that defy any possible match.

But the fabulous presence of Harvey Keitel, Stephen Dorff and Timothy Hutton make of this thriller a true tour de force; the increasing tension will struggle you from start to finish.

A remarkable and neglected picture of this year.",1122336000,2,840,5.0215827338129495
902907,4,6304556845,"City of Industry is another entry into Tough Guy Cinema.  The story could be from any noir of any decade.  It's a stylish, violent crime movie.  You're either on board or off.
Roy (Harvey Keitel) comes to LA to help his brother (Timothy Hutton) and two other hoods pull a high profile robbery.  They take down a jewelery store and before you know it they're splitting the cash.  Then Skip (Stephen Dorff) caps Timothy Hutton (who looks like preppy sleaze with that scruffy beard).
This movie is about Harvey Keitel getting revenge, no matter what.  He dedicates his life, or about a week in his life, to hunting down Stephen Dorff.  It's a stylish, slick film, full of LA 'industrial' locations of the machinery and criminal type.  Take a bit of To Live and Die in LA, a bit of old fashioned noir, a lot of blood (including a head-bashing finale), and Harvey just being Harvey.  A highlight is the laptpop bit in the lawyer's office.  Subtle menace.

902911,4,6304556845,"In this contemporary film noir, two brothers with the same alma mater-- Folsom Prison-- discover something about loyalty and what ""honor among thieves"" really means, in ""City of Industry,"" directed by John Irvin.  Lee Egan (Timothy Hutton) puts together a crew of four men, including his brother, Roy (Harvey Keitel), to take down a jewelry store in Palm Springs, California.  If all goes well, they look to score a cool three mil in diamonds, and Lee has a fence in L.A. ready to move the merchandise.  Lee and Roy are solid, as is Jorge (Wade Dominguez), the third member of the crew who is already looking at 2 to 5 in Folsom, having been convicted of carrying a concealed weapon.  Jorge wants a quick score that will take care of his wife, Rachel (Famke Janssen), and their two kids while he's away.  The wild card of the bunch is Skip Kovich (Stephen Dorff), their wheel man; he has a wild streak that emboldens him too much for his own good, a flaky girlfriend and some ideas of his own about how the split from the job should go down.  Lee contends that it's going to be an easy score, with each man's share being ""Not bad for a day's work.""  But you can bet that anytime you have a ""sure thing"" it's going to turn out to be anything but, and this caper is, of course, no exception.
 As is befitting the subject matter, the film is dark-- much of it takes place at night, or in rather seedy, industrial locales-- with a touch of artistic cinematography that gives a sense of urgency to the story.  It quickly shifts from the posh atmosphere of Palm Springs to downtown Los Angeles and Chinatown, an environment through which you get a sense of who these guys are and what they are about.  As Rachel says to Roy at one point, ""You guys are all alike--""
 As Roy, Keitel carries the film with the kind of credible performance we've come to expect from him.  While this character is certainly not a stretch for him-- you've seen ""Roy"" many times before, played by Keitel and others-- he does put a unique stamp on him; he's familiar, but Keitel manages to avoid letting him slip into stereotype.  And that is no easy task when you take into consideration that in reality a man like Roy would necessarily share certain traits with others of his ilk.  What makes the difference is Keitel's consummate ability as an actor, and his concern with fleshing out the details of his character.
 The role of Lee is something of a departure for Hutton, though similar to the part he played in ""Playing God,"" but with much more definition.  He gives Lee a very ""real"" quality, the cool confidence of one who lives just beyond the fringe of what society deems acceptable.  When he mentions that he's been in Folsom, it's believable.  Dorff, meanwhile, is effective as Skip, a guy perpetually pumped and strung out, crazy-- but like a fox-- with an aura of menace about him that is nearly tangible.  In attitude and style, Skip is reminiscent of Laurence Fishburne's two-fisted, gun toting Jump in ""King of New York.""  And Janssen gives a notable performance also, successfully creating the one character in the film with whom the audience can sympathize.  You feel her desperation and the concern she has for her children's well being, which effectively adds valuable context to the story.
 The supporting cast includes Michael Jai White (Odell), Lucy Liu (Cathi), Reno Wilson (Keshaun), Dana Barron (Gena), Tamara Clatterbuck (Sunny), Brian Brophy (Backus) and Francois Chau (Uncle Luke).  A violent and stylish examination of the criminal element in our midst, ""City of Industry"" is a hard-edged film that presents the matter-of-fact way in which those who subscribe to a life of crime seemingly function within their own sect of society.  It's a part of life many would just as soon deny in reality, but as Steve McQueen said many years ago in ""Bullitt,"" ""That's where half of it is.""  And a film like this is not about to let you forget it.",987811200,34,3933,4.632564841498559
902986,5,6304556845,"Great film. Though Harvey Keitel's range has tended to be overwhelmed by this kind of heavyweight role, there are enough chances to see him as the great actor he really is. I particularly like the pace adopted by the director and actors for each scene - fast and furious in the action scenes with great editing and effects while allowing the quieter scenes, involving no more than two people, to breathe and develop their own inner tension. This director would I think be one of Brando's favourites, one who ""gets out of the way"" and lets the actors do their thing.

The gangster plot - betrayal by a best friend as in ""Point Blank"" - is slightly changed to betrayal by a ""little sh@t"" - it's all totally believable except the conventional suspension of beliefs where cars can blow up and mayhem caused without the appearance of a single cop for ages, or is that true too! Stephen Dorff plays the runt to Keitel's stand up guy to a ""T"" and all the rest of the cast turn in great performances.

It seems to me, watching the featurette interviews, that everybody involved knew exactly what they were aiming for and how to produce an extremely polished film. On the other hand they achieved even more and to my mind this is one of the best films in this genre I have seen.

And of course a vehicle for Harvey Keitel who dominates the picture. I first took note of Keitel playing Thomas Paine in the French-Italian film ""That Night in Varenne"" with Marcello Mastroianni and an international cast in a historical costume drama about the flight of Louis XVI and the royal family from the revolution in Paris to the French border. Who has not seen his jaw dropping performance in Bad Lieutenant? There are a host of other great roles that seem to have got buried in low profile movies.

It's almost like classic grinhouse cinema. like 'Ms. 45' or 'Maniac'. Kietel fits like a glove into a story like this. Few actors can fit so great into a role like this. He makes it work, and while he's no Mr. White here, he's just spellbinding in this sort of film as only Harvey can be. The film feels seedy, underground, and totally B-film nostalgic. There are plot holes, hokey asian gangs, half assed shootouts, double crosses, the whole nine yards. It's low key gritty stuff that screams low budget, but fun none the less. Some memorable moments include an early cameo by O'Rin her self, Lucy Liu in an early short cameo as a stripper, and even Elliott Gould signed on for a very silly cliche and short role as a loneshark.

A tale of one man's pursuit for justice no matter what comes his way, it's my favorite Keitel film I have seen yet.

903001,3,6304556845,"City of Industry (1997) is a hard-hitting crime drama that will
leave the audience dazed and reeling by  2 powerful (virtual)
left and right jabs to the stomach.

The reason the script and scenes work flows from its realism, in
the totality of the work, in that the action is  entirely
believable, credible as is the case with the acting.

Four underground thugs, played by Harvey Keitel, Stephen Dorff,
Tim Hutton and Wade Dominguez, stakeout a bank in preparation of
relieving  all its vault's and safety deposit boxes contents for
themselves.

After, it's a race against the clock in terms of
determining who  stays alive, whose greed and skill
combination will get the upper hand in keeping the loot.

Combining a taste for the good life (hotel pool-side luxury) and
a desire to do the least effort to earn it (through hold ups and
double crosses) the gang prepare to split 3.5 million in
gems and valuables.

Unfortunately, in between the shotgun action, car pursuits, body
combats, explosions, car thefts, beatings, intimidation,
shakedowns, knife slashing, there is a limited or no law
enforcement, which oversimplifies a similar scenario.

Keitel's skill in getting information in the underground  is also
impressive, as he is able to reach the right people to get the
right information needed, whether it be from a barman, attorney,
pole dancer, or close friends of his rivals in that milieu. Being
an expert at it, he can get blood from a rock, contacting if need
be, powerful triads who themselves have far-reaching contacts
tapping databases of info for addresses and locating people by
their cell phone beacon.

A paradox of this story, is the girl played by Famke who,
despite not partaking in the events, acknowledges her own
humanity by applying medical treatments to a  gang member, and
caring about the particular situation, (as does the audience, in
the final analysis), as bodies are littered on the ground, in a
heart-breaking, nightmarish, one-dimensional manner from the
psychotic events having unfolded.

City of Industry is unique enough to be revisited for the
special effects, action, visual charisma of the actors and
quality of the filming, if not for Keitel's presence.

wide-screen release, and suitable soundtrack.",1239580800,4,2304,5.090425531914893
903002,4,6304556845,"Harvey Keitel (Roy) plays his usual self-assured character leading a group in a jewelry heist, and then goes up against a myriad of contract killers.

Famke is very attractive with or without makeup, (and very tall-with those long legs). Timothy Hutton, Roy's brother (killed off early by Dorff) and Lucy Liu have minor parts.

All I can say is you'll be so very happy when Harvey Keitel smears Stephen Dorff's brains all over the pavement, towards the end of the movie. Stephen Dorff gives and absolutely first-class perfomance of a double-crossing, short-tempered, quick-drawing psychopath, who won't be double-crossed (as he has double-crossed) by anyone.

Okay, so pretty much everyone who knows this movie exists knows it because Lucy Liu is topless for roughly forty-five seconds of this film. Which is too bad, because it's a fun little slice of noir that's sure to please.

Roy Egan (Harvey Keitel) is a professional thief who's getting ready to retire. His brother Lee (Timothy Hutton, fresh off the success of Playing God) convinces him to put off retirement to do one more job, robbing the Russian Mob of three million dollars' worth of contraband diamonds. Also in on the job are Jorge Montana (the late Wade Dominguez, of Dangerous Minds fame) and Skip Kovich (Blade's Stephen Dorff), the getaway driver. Things go horribly wrong in the worst possible way: Skip kills Lee and Jorge, and narrowly misses Roy, who (of course) vows revenge. The bulk of the film is Roy tracking Skip, while being hidden by Jorge's wife Rachel (Famke Janssen). Meanwhile, the Russians aren't too happy with being hit, either.

Good, solid action, a fast pace, and some decent acting make this one worth watching. Oh, yeah, and there's a Lucy Liu semi-nude scene, in case you hadn't heard. *** ",1155513600,,1162,4.795

7874961,5,6304556845,"The Toronto Sun astutely called ""City of Industry"", ""a four-star, edge-of-your-seat crime and revenge story.""
The 1997 John Irvin film ""City of Industry"" is one super-cool flick. I remember reading a review of it by the
late Roger Ebert, possibly the worst film critic I've ever seen (closely rivaled by the equally late, pretentious
Pauline Kael). Old ""Rodge"" knitpicked ""City of Industry"" to death and only gave it 1/2 star out of 4, which is
not very good. He's the same guy who said a viewer ""would have to be an idiot"" to criticize the movie ""Last
Tango in Paris"". Yea, right. ""City"" was playing on one of my HD movie channels recently and I checked it out
as I'm a huge Harvey Keitel fan and hadn't heard much about the film otherwise. Wow, am I ever glad I did!
From the opening moving shots of the L.A. freeway with the Massive Attack song ""Three"" in the soundtrack
to the gut-wrenching, riveting final scenes between Keitel's character Egan and the scumbag he's been after
since early on, Skip, played by Stephen Dorft, ""City of Industry"" is a brutal, no-nonsense, and veritable film
experience. Harvey Keitel is in his element playing psycho, tough-guy characters, and you will see him do it
nowhere better than in ""City of Industry"". A successful diamond heist by four low-lifes gets very nasty when
one (Skip) decides to take more than his fair share in very violent fashion, and it becomes a cat-and-mouse
game with Skip and Egan both after each other. The original music in the soundtrack by Stephen Endelman,
a British classical composer & conductor, is haunting, dramatic, & gorgeous, contributing greatly to the film's
grim, menacing tone. Piano, trumpet, violin, and English horn were beautifully scored by him  at key points in
the story with cool effect.  It amazes me how Keitel time and time again plays these roles and, yet, manages
to infuse each one with a new identity and perspective. This guy is a magnificent and brilliant actor. In ""City"",
he is just electrifying with his intensity and depth, even in silence. I'm astounded this movie is not more well
known. Irvin, who's made such films as ""Ghost Story""(1981), ""Raw Deal""(1986), & ""Hamburger Hill""(1987), is
no stranger to the action genre and ""City"" is a wonderful example of a master director of this form. Along with
the splendid Keitel, all of the acting in the picture is superb with Dorft as the TRUELY unlikable Skip, Timothy
Hutton as Egan's brother who brings him out of retirement for one last sure-thing heist, Wade Dominguez as
the last member of the group who's already set for more prison time, and the marvelous Famke Janssen who
plays the very tough and cunning wife of Wade's character who soon finds herself alone & willing to work out
 a deal to help Egan (Keitel) find Skip. The film was shot mostly in L.A. in the more gritty and industrial spots
with alot of night settings from Irvin. It's a very dark, intense, and somber film with an added background on
the Chinese underworld mob, corruption, and black gangs involved with both. ""City of Industry"" reminded me
at several times of the 1985 William Friedkin picture ""To Live and Die in LA"", another dark story about crime,
revenge, and death in the City of Angels. Lucy Liu makes a brief appearance in her early film career as a lead
to Skip that Egan traces and Elliot Gould makes an uncredited appearance as a creepy loan shark dealing with
Skip. I've since gotten the dvd of ""City"" and it looks (and sounds) fabulous on an HD screen. If you're a fan of
fast-paced, intelligent, and well-acted film-noir in a modern (but violent) setting, you can't go wrong with ""City
of Industry"". Having Harvey Keitel on board in a terrific role helps, as well. WHEN will this man get his just due
and an Academy Award for his incredible acting? ""City"" is yet one more example of his extraordinary genius.

P.S. For another look at Keitel getting his revenge in a VERY ruthless way at the end of a film,
check out the largely overlooked 1978 ""Fingers"", in which he portrays a classical pianist/debt
collector with some REAL serious personal issues. Weird, unforgettable, and powerful. Not for
children or those offended by raw brutality, sex, and extreme language. Called one of the top
20 mob movies of all time and a classic timepiece from the 70's.",1432944000,,4295,4.745649263721553
