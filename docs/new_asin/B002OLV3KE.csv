8376103,2,B002OLV3KE,Does confuse your kid if you are trying to teach Spanish. Letter pronunciation is good but it does not help if the words in this material are for English pronunciation.,1371340800,,168,4.633333333333334
8376104,2,B002OLV3KE,"This dvd was not what I expected.  I wanted a dvd to teach the alphabet completely in Spanish.  This dvd goes through each letter, says its name in english and spanish, then shows you an object that starts with the letter in English.  For example: for the letter A they showed an ape.  I was hoping that they would show the letter, say it in Spanish, then show a picture that begins with that letter in Spanish.  For example: ""A"" could be ""abeja"" (bee in english). I was disappointed in this product.",1351987200,4,500,4.391304347826087
