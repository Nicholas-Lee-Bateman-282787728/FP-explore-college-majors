7944690,5,B00005M2BY,"I was searching a long time for this dvd, as it is an registration of a live broadcast. The performances are great and her duet with Marc Anthony as they do Mi Tierra is wonderful. The only minor on this dvd is the very tight timetable in which everything is done. It is a TV broadcast, so they can't interact with the audience as you see at a real live concert, but that's it. Great images, great sound and a beautiful Gloria Estefan!!!",1338854400,,437,4.27710843373494
7944691,5,B00005M2BY,"I'm biased because I buy everything she does, but this is a really big-production show and will give you some great feel-good moments.

Another excellent choice is her ""Evolution"" DVD, which is a wonderful compilation of some of her best music videos and live recordings.

But if you want the very best of Gloria Estefan I still favor her ""Homecoming"" VHS tape!  It is incredible--and a shame it was produced before DVDs.

7944692,3,B00005M2BY,"This DVD is short, have good numbers of dance and good footage. The edition is strange but Gloria always rules ! I prefer the evolution and unwrapped videos as live performances but if you aere a Gloria""s fan you must buy this video too.",1244937600,,237,4.409090909090909
7944693,2,B00005M2BY,Will there be any DVDs on Into The Light World Tour and Homecoming Concert? I still really love that concert..I love Evolution too..but I hope they would produce DVDs for those Live concerts..,1214870400,,192,4.848484848484849
7944694,4,B00005M2BY,"This concert is for the Latin blood in all of us - even us down here in New Zealand.
Its not the entire show I'm sure, but the music is rich and full bodied. Her voice mixed with great musicians is a real treat!!!
A must have for your collection.",1021248000,4,246,3.94
7944695,3,B00005M2BY,"After watching the video of Gloria's Evolution Tour, I expected something similar with the Atlantis concert. This video is different from every other live concert recorded by Gloria. It offers new songs from the album Alma Caribena, with Celia Cruz and Jose Feliciano as guests. Songs (5) of Alma Caribena played here sounded pretty identical to the record, which was boring sometimes, as I was looking for something new, a different sound.
Two thumbs up for the new versions of ""Conga/1-2-3/... (medley)"", ""coming out of the dark"" and ""turn the beat around/Higher...(medley)"". Percussion was spectacular.
I didn't like the edition of the video...It doesn't show a concise sequence between songs. It's like watching ""the best of Atlantis"" instead of a whole concert. Personally, I don't like that. Audio is OK.
My suggestion: get the evolution tour, and wait for the next video.",1017014400,11,878,5.190140845070423
