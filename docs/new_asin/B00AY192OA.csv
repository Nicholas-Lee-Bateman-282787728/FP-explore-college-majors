8558959,5,B00AY192OA,"This is the best TTBHH yet! G Craige includes Scripture, research, pictures, and a little science experiment video in this new DVD. I was amazed at how he explains music and breaks it down to the science behind it.  This DVD will make you think completely different about the music you listen to.
