7980963,4,B00008AORU,"Slow-moving but beautifully acted little film, a ""whodunit,"" not of a murder but of who sired the young man, Edwin, who never appears on screen. That was my problem with it. I found it hard to watch the Judge (Guinness) accusing his neighbor (Paul Rogers) of having ""rogered"" Guinness's wife and produced Edwin, without ever seeing Edwin himself. SPOILERS On a beautiful English day in the country, the two neighbors quarrel with each other over Edwin's parentage. Edwin, in fact, comes for a visit, but the movie omits this visit. It would seem that the gardener was the actual sire, But since we never see him, either, the movie is a kind of intellectual joke, probably more amusing to a British audience than an American one.",1464134400,,728,4.785714285714286
7980964,4,B00008AORU,"Watching the DVD of ""EDWIN"", written by John Mortimer, has left me pleasntly puzzled.  Lady Margaret speaks warmly not only of her summer of love (in the early 50's appearently) but of all 3 men in the story.  She loved Tom, the neighbor, for his strength and independance. She loved Fennimore, her husband, because he was full of fear and tried to please everybody. And she loved Catchmold, the gardener, because she loves gardening too, and also the way he looks planting and weeding, etc.  We never see Catchmold in the story, but his importance expands rapidly in the last 5 minutes of the movie.  Lady Margaret is a free spirit and is forced to be slightly 'dizzy' in order to fit all her loves into the logic of the ending.

My pleasnt puzzlement is this:  At the story's end Lady Margaret makes clear her affection for all 3 men, and at first we assume it was Catchmold who was Edwin's biolgically father.  We make this assumption mainly because the 2 other men have been fighting, for most of the story, over who is the real father of Edwin.  We have been trained to look for plot twists at the end of stories.  But Margaret says at least twice she s not responsible for the future, which means to me that she doen't know who the real father is because she had 3 lovers that summer.  Of course DNA testing would clear up the matter, but then FATE and a certain mystical quality to the story's end would be lost.  The story ends with the 2 men seeing Margaret as not only as mysterious but mythic and goddess-like.  An underrated movie.",1372896000,,1543,4.451957295373665
7980965,5,B00008AORU,"This DVD is one of my favorites. I have watched it many times and feel it is a masterful piece of writing and acting. Alec Guinness, his supporting actors and the director deserved an Oscar for this delightful piece of entertainment.",1349395200,,233,4.7073170731707314
7980966,4,B00008AORU,"Admirers of the work of the late Sir Alec Guinness will perhaps find EDWIN satisfactorily droll.

Guinness plays Sir Fennimore Truscott, a curmudgeonly and recently retired High Court judge left to stew in his own pomposity on his country estate with his wife, Lady Margaret (Renee Asherson). Used to a lifetime of judging criminal behavior, Truscott can't let it go. His current obsession, presented in asides to the viewer as if giving evidence to a jury, is the case against his next door neighbor of many years, Tom Marjoriebanks (Paul Rogers), whom Sir Fennimore suspects of ""rogering"" Lady Margaret many years before in the garden conservatory. About the time she became pregnant with the Truscott's now grown son, Edwin, actually. It doesn't mollify Truscott that Tom is constantly at his wife's side helping out with kitchen and garden chores. And the Judge has a patrician contempt for Marjoriebanks, a common pottery maker. (Tom would say ""craftsman of fine ceramics."")

When Sir Fennimore confronts Tom with his suspicions, the latter replies incredulously - but perhaps not incredulously enough - with observations about Edwin's artistic and sensitive nature. More akin to Tom's own, you think? In any case, Truscott now begins to doubt his paternity, and his indignation is further fueled. Unfortunately, the viewer never gets to meet Edwin, so one is left to Truscott's own mental contortions and dry comments.

My wife gave up about two-thirds in, bored by the slow pacing and/or too irritated with Truscott's aloofness. But, a keen Guinness fan after his superb role as Smiley in TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE, I kept a stiff upper lip. I was rewarded when Lady Margaret, a free spirit considered a ""Red"" by her disapproving husband, comes to the forefront of the stage near the film's conclusion, when she reveals herself to be an independent woman completely at ease with her life and capable of attachment to more than one man. When pressed on the matter, she calmly makes allusion to Edwin's real biological father, a revelation that goes completely over the head of her self-preoccupied husband, and which leaves both Truscott and Marjoriebanks muttering into their teacups about the mysterious nature of the human female.

EDWIN might be considered a cautionary tale about male retirees with way too much time on their hands, or about that facet of human nature which allows an individual to find emotional needs met by more than one individual. EDWIN is a low key but pointed reminder that even the most wise of men is incapable of recognizing the truth of the latter.",1100131200,9,2610,5.048723897911833
