4134476,4,B003L16F68,I loved this Documentary series because it was very entertaining and covered every aspect of early Egyptian life and answered at lot of questions that were posed.,1390435200,2,162,5.037037037037037
4134477,4,B003L16F68,"I have a large DVD collection on Egypt its history as well as its culture. The Discovery channel also has a DVD named Ancient Egypt Unearthed that contains a lot of the same information found in this DVD set. However, this DVD set Egypt Uncovered has a chapter on Post Mortem that goes into the current study of mummies that is allowing scientists to fight modern diseases. This chapter alone is worth viewing if you have these other DVDs. If you are just starting out in studying Egypt this DVD would make for a good starting point. I still recommend it.",1376092800,5,555,4.5049504950495045
4134478,5,B003L16F68,"There is another video collection of Discovery Channel videos titled ""Ancient Egypt Unearthed."" It contains all 5 of the videos in this collection, plus a second disk with additional videos. I see complaints here about the size of the display on this collection - the other collection has the videos optimized for 16 x 9 widescreen televisions. Egypt is a wonderful place and we need to learn all we can about this fascinating land, but you'll be much happier with the other collection -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Egypt-Unearthed/dp/B001HB1K32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Egypt Unearthed</a>",1367452800,29,655,6.370786516853933
4134479,5,B003L16F68,I received 3 DVD's on Egypt all at the same time.  They were in perfect condition.  I love anything about Ancient Egypt and I would recommend these DVD's to anyone who is interested in Ancient Egypt..,1363219200,3,200,4.527777777777778
4134480,4,B003L16F68,"This is a great 5-part (50 min per episode) program about ancient Egypt.  One star is deducted because Kultur authored the programs in non-anamorphic widescreen.  If you no longer use a 4:3 TV, you get to watch a postage-stamp sized picture on your widescreen TV (black bars on top and larger black bars on the sides). Hell, the picture is even smaller than you would see when watching a standard 4:3 program on a widescreen TV. I would ramp my review up to 5 stars if Kultur would remaster this title!  Don't be fooled by the 16:9 widescreen format listed on the back--unless, of course, you're still watching on a 4:3 TV!",1347753600,15,623,4.544642857142857
