7787663,5,B01HIUL6WU,An excellent and accurate depiction of LBJ ad I remember him.  A flawed man but overall a good president.,1477699200,,105,4.526315789473684
7787664,5,B01HIUL6WU,"Excellent portrayal of activities at the level of MLK, Southern Cristian Leadership Conference, and LBJ during the events of the summer of 1964 voter drives and deaths of Schwener, Goodman, and Cheney, and the struggle to pass the Civil rights Act of 1964.  See it along with the film Mississippi Burning telling the events as seen by the victims and the FBI investigators to get the worm's eye view/experience along with the movers-and-shakers view/experience.",1477440000,,461,5.22972972972973
7787665,5,B01HIUL6WU,"Absolutely absorbing movie about Lyndon Johnson and the passage of landmark civil rights legislation.  The story is far more complicated than most people realize with Johnson stubbornly pushing the legislation forward against some tough obstacles.  Bryan Cranston is outstanding playing the manipulative, paranoid and complex LBJ and the whole ensemble cast hits the right notes.  For anyone with even a passing interest in American History this movie is essential.  A fascinating, complex story well told, and well acted, from beginning to end.",1477440000,,545,5.609756097560975

7787669,5,B01HIUL6WU,"Adpated from a play seen at the Shakespeare Festival in Ashland some years ago, I was apprehensive that the conversion to film would cost the drama spontenaiety and vibrance. I was happily wrong. This is a terrific film with terrific acting to boot. A great historical piece that is also a wonderful piece of stage drama re-interpreted brilliantly for film. If you like political history and intrigue, this is a fine investment",1473120000,12,427,4.944444444444445
7787670,5,B01HIUL6WU,"Just got done watching this great movie. Set around Lyndon B Johnson's early days as the President of the United States. After Kennedy was shot, Lyndon is now thrown into being the head chief. Around the same time Martin Luther King Jr. is trying to get a bill passed making it possible for the negro community to be able to vote. This is set way before my time, but to have a movie that brings you back in time,will show how awful it really must of been back then. To have no rights?? I can't even imagine. I'm happy everything worked out and those people now have the same rights as the rest of us. I could only imagine being alive when women weren't allowed to vote. The actor who plays Lyndon did very well. Bryan Cranston, from Malcolm in the the Middle looks just like the president. His acting is superb and I hope he gets an award for best actor portrayal. I highly recommend this movie. Share it with the younger generation,maybe they will have a better idea of our country's past.

7787671,5,B01HIUL6WU,"For all intents and purposes Bryan Cranston could be Lyndon Johnson. Looks. Voice. Appearance. Everything. I was in high school and college when LBJ was President. I thus remember him pretty well plus the issues swirling around him. The major event in this story is the passage of the Civil Rights Law of 1964. The Vietnam War is going on in the background but no one is making an issue of it yet. That is coming but not in 1964.

I was glad to see that we spent a scant amount of time on the JFK assassination and pretty much launched immediately into the LBJ presidency as soon as the assassination occurred. For those of you interested in how the political parties realigned themselves, this movie explains that quite well also. LBJ, a southerner and and a Democrat pushed the Civil Rights Bill through. The Southern states shifted their party allegiance thereafter and that is where they are today, in the GOP. This cost LBJ his best friend from Georgia with whom he'd been in the Senate.

One thing that we keep reading and hearing today from the media is that today's politicians do not know how to be constantly meeting and making deals outside of the hallowed halls of government. Usually LBJ is mentioned as the consummate practitioner of the political deal. We see this in the film. The man is constantly on the phone or in meetings. He gets very little sleep because he is always making his deals. He knew exactly how each person was planning to vote and who could be cajoled or offered something and who couldn't. He could even deal with Hoover over at the FBI and no one else could.

I was enthralled throughout and the time just swept by. When this was a play I wished I could have seen it. Thus, it was a real boon for me that it was made into an HBO movie.

If there is any doubt in your mind about Bryan Cranston being a consummate actor, you will have NO doubts about that after seeing this. He is just marvelous.",1467676800,26,1931,4.446327683615819

Civil rights, Kennedy assasination, a bit of Viet Nam, and a whole lot of LBJ's complex personality are encapsulated in this flick. I would suggest this for any history buff or fan of the era.

7787696,5,B01HIUL6WU,Great film about an imperfect president.

7787700,5,B01HIUL6WU,"I have this, and I first watched it on TV recently.  Bryan Cranston is one of my favorite actors of all time, and in this movie he plays Lyndon Johnson.",1483142400,,152,4.066666666666666
7787701,4,B01HIUL6WU,"Robert Schenkkans award winning play is lifted to the screen by director Jay Roach. The film brought Schenkkan and his screenplay along with Tony winning Bryan Cranston as President Lyndon B. Johnson. The film covers just under one year in Johnsons presidency beginning hours after President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. It concludes with his election in November 1964. Virtually no time is spent with the personal aftermath of the murder. One brief shot shows Jackie Kennedy sitting in a small room still wearing her blood stained pink suit. It will be interesting to see the new movie, Jackie, for that perspective on the aftermath.

Clearly LBJ is moving on and one of his first orders of business is to press ahead with Kennedys fledgling Civil Rights Act. This sets the stage for LBJs wrangling of his fellow Southern Democrats and Republicans along with the Civil Rights stalwarts led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (Anthony Mackie). Cranstons performance as Johnson is worth the price of admission alone. He has nailed not only the look (excellent make-up work), the walk, the stance, the mannerisms and the cadence of his Texas drawl.

Johnson vowed to get the legislation passed but for it to have any chance he had to gut the voting rights provision. This was unacceptable to King and his associates but eventually they agreed when LBJ promised to put it back in play after his election. On the other side, the Southern Dems led by a long time LBJ mentor, Sen. Richard Russell (Frank Langella) vowed to kill the legislation by filibuster which required a 2/3rd majority to override in those days. It takes only 60 votes now. It is great fun to watch Johnson button-hole various senators, representatives and governors throughout this movie. He worked them every which way. Promises, bribes, threats? Whatever worked. As if this battle wasn't enough to contend with, he also had an upcoming election and he anticipated the GOP nominee, Barry Goldwater was a legitimate threat. We know of course, Johnson won the 64 election in a landslide.

This was also the beginning of the end of his otherwise successful presidency. The conflict in Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam, was an increasingly serious annoyance. Melissa Leo is perfect as Lady Bird, a constant influence on her husband in this biopic. A relatively obscure subplot involves Johnsons chief political aide, Walter Jenkins (Todd Weeks). Jenkins, a married man with 6 children was also a closeted homosexual. When hes arrested for having public sex with a man, the potential scandal could have impacted the election. In a great scene at the end of the movie, LBJ is having a conversation with J. Edgar Hoover (Stephen Root) about keeping the Jenkins affair under wraps. Johnson says he had no idea Jenkins was gay and asks Hoover (discovered to be gay) how you know when someone is a homosexual. Hoover tells LBJ by the way they walk, dress, speak. Somehow Cranstons LBJ looks at Hoover with an all-knowing expression. Perfect.",1483142400,3,3003,4.97808764940239

And, in the case of Cranston as LBJ, strikingly similar.  Two score reviews and not a single criticism of his acting.  Cranston plays LBJ better than LBJ could!
Given that our incoming president and LBJ have very similar demeanor's, young people, those under 75, should reflect on what this might mean to the future.  I haven't a clue, but maybe you will!",1481068800,,589,4.792079207920792

7787707,5,B01HIUL6WU,"Highly recommended theatrical film of Lyndon Johnson's first year as President, based on the Broadway play.  Captures the life and time our 36th president, detailed without ever losing a moment of high drama. All of the political genius, his gritty profane complexity, as well as the skill, soaring vision and genius of the man are all there. Dramatic performances by Cranston and the rest of the cast are outstanding. Watch it with someone younger for the insight into our history and a clearer understanding of why LBJ, the flawed giant, was and remains one of our most significant chief executives, or watch it alone to reflect on an American icon and moment captured perfectly by the film makers craft. One of the best political 'biopics' ever made.",1480636800,,753,4.929133858267717
7787708,5,B01HIUL6WU,"I first saw this film on HBO and I was so impressed that I could hardly wait until I had the opportunity to see it again since it was not released in theaters. Brian Cranston was terrific. The language was strong but I think that was typical of the way LBJ. Frank Langella was also excellent. Anthony Mackie was very good but did not resemble Martin Luther King as I remembered him. I remember Martin Luther King as being physically larger in appearance  and much more commanding. All of the supporting players were excellent. Melissa Leo as Lady Bird at times reflected how badly she felt when LBJ reacted so badly when she tried to consoled him. Excellent film.
