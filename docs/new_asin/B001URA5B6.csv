8344771,5,B001URA5B6,"Every Antagonist movie I have ever seen has left me feeling good about where I am in my own life and projects and leaves me feeling inspired to do more than I am.  If you are an artist, want to be one, or have friends that are, you NEED to see this film.  It's the real deal.",1382054400,,275,3.807017543859649
8344772,5,B001URA5B6,"You do not have to be an artist to enjoy this film!  It serves as an encouragement to create in whatever means by whatever means possible.  The film lets you into the lives of Antagonists and their collaborators along with their diverse projects.  The physical actualities of putting up an art show (in a gallery and on the street) are clear, but the film exemplifies the power of cross-cultural collaboration via both art and dialogue. In the true spirit of Antagonist collaboration European artists are introduced of which American viewers may not be aware.  The film serves as a reminder of the immense creativity and insight that can be born through collaboration. Artists and non-artists alike will be encouraged by its quality and spirit.",1376265600,,744,4.975806451612903
8344773,1,B001URA5B6,I purchased this DVD with hopes of seeing amazing new art works from artist but that was very hopeful. After living in Berlin for many years I was excited to see the art works from their and the art from New York together. I was disappointed. It was like watching Mtv's The Real World. Basically a film of unorganized artists driving around. The art they do show is amazing on the other hand. But it is still great to see a movement of artist spreading art across the oceans.,1358035200,,475,4.348314606741573
8344774,5,B001URA5B6,"What more could you want from a film called ""This Is Berlin Not New York"" artists from New York go over to Berlin to work with German artists. They break into building to make art. This is like a home movie and you feel like you are part of the trip.

Here are other books and films by the Antagonist Movement

8344775,5,B001URA5B6,"Not all underground artists deserve to be seen & heard, but this group ABSOLUTELY does! Not only do you get to know this likable motley crew, you get to see the real hardcore talent that each has in their own unique way. But what I liked is that it's not just a bunch of artist bios, showing off their work, it's about finding & building a community at home & abroad with people who share your passion (& struggle). That's what brings this group together from the U.S. to Germany, and thats what's adds to the beauty of this well-shot film",1328918400,4,539,4.346534653465347
8344776,5,B001URA5B6,"For any artist who is discouraged by the current art world, you should really watch this movie. The artists in this movie are all poor, just like the rest of us, but they just don't stop making art. They travel, they meet other artists all over the world, and they make good art. Really good art. The innate, driving need to make art compels them to continue working, even through the toughest obstacles, and brings a very positive light into the world of a starving artist. Absolute must. Watch it.",1328140800,5,499,4.555555555555555
8344777,5,B001URA5B6,"I wanted to see a movie about Berlin and came across this, but it's more about the group of young artists who travel the world making art. Well done with live action mixed with stop-motion.",1325116800,3,189,4.428571428571429
8344778,5,B001URA5B6,"Most documentaries are about famous well known artists. This film is about the other 99% of the art world people just trying to make it. I feel more connected to the people in this film and enjoyed the ride. And I loved the music. This film should be shown to anyone thinking about becoming an artists.

8344779,5,B001URA5B6,"I saw this DVD on sale at the St. Mark's Bookshop in the East Village on my last visit to New York City. Since I plan to spend my vacation in Berlin next year, I ordered this DVD from Amazon when I got home. The film follows a group of artists as they travel to Berlin to show their work at a gallery, in the Mitte district I think. One of the artists is Arturo Vega, the artist behind the Ramones. So not only do you get some insight into the art world of New York City, you also get a glimpse of the underground art scene in Berlin. Abandoned buildings and squatter flats are frequently used as art spaces in the counterculture tradition of Kreuzberg. The Antagonist Art Movement is given the chance to do their thing in such an abandoned building.

The artists did some typical tourist activities while in Berlin so this film was of some slight interest to me as a future tourist in that city. But I'm also interested in the contemporary New York City art scene so I was not bored by the lengthy gallery scenes. The artwork seemed a little grungy to me. I'm not quite sure why a curator in Berlin would be so eager to bring this show over. I mean it must have been expensive. I'm surprised that underground art can manage international outreach.

It would be cool to explore the Kreuzberg area and visit underground art galleries while I'm in Berlin. I've been visiting New York City often but so far I have not set foot into a gallery.",1274486400,8,1439,4.325925925925926
