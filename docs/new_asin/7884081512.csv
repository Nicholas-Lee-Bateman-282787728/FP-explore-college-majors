8299226,3,7884081512,This DVD does have some really good information but it is presented with a demonstration partner who falls down at the slightest flinch of his teachers hand. Not realistic and takes away from the meaning behind the technique the teacher is attempting to explain. If you are an experienced martial artist in the Chinese internal systems you might be able to pick out the value in the information the teacher is trying to impart.,1417132800,,427,4.783783783783784
