6281607,5,B00IML5TZ0,"Best practical shooting DVD I have seen so far.  The content in this video lays out the training path from dryfire practice, to livefire practice, to the match setting. Along the way it shows you what to look for and how to correct any issues you might be having along the path.  Besides the gun handling skills content there are also some useful bits of stage break down, execution and review. I enjoyed the fact that this particular video skipped over all of the noob grip/stance stuff and didn't waste any time getting into the meat that more experienced shooters are looking for.  Having said that I would still recommend this video to any skill level of shooter as there is something for everyone to get out of it. Going along those lines the video stars 3 shooters of varying skill levels and it really proves that Ben's methods are solid for anyone. I just wish Ben would have picked a Production Division ""average Joe""  Open sucks  ;)",1393632000,2,942,4.583333333333333
6281608,5,B00IML5TZ0,"The title says a lot about this DVD. This is not a how to shoot video. This video us geared towards those who are already competing and have reached that inevitable plateau. Just about every shooter gets to the point where they're practicing the same thing time and time again and don't know what to do to get past that point. In this DVD, Ben puts together all the pieces of an ever evolving training regimen. The DVD links dryfire, live fire and live fire practice stages all into a program that can elevate your game. His prior books and podcasts are also referenced throughout as they relate to the material that is being presented. This gives the student additional material to coincide with what was just demonstrated. Also, instead of just watching Ben burn down drills and stages, the support shooters, of different skill levels, give great examples of how changing just a couple of techniques can reduce your time and increase your points on a stage. If you're serious about getting to the next level, this DVD is a must have.",1393545600,2,1035,4.66120218579235
6281609,5,B00IML5TZ0,"Not for the meek, only for those who wanna become BOSSES in USPSA

Yet again the shooting masses have been graced with another installment of detailed training, precise techniques of both dry-fire and live-fire training, and most of all a guide to become a BOSS in USPSA regardless the class or division one aspires to attain. Training to Win is packed with information that compliments the preceding books Skills & Drills and Champion Shooting: Guaranteed Results in 15 Minutes a Day Vol. 2 that are referenced by book and page number during each drill. All of this is compliments of the BOSS himself Ben Stoeger, GM shooter and national champion among just of the few hats he wears.

So you are probably thinking why do you need to own the DVD if you have and read all of his books? The simple answer is watching Ben and the other shooters perform these techniques live can prove invaluable as certain idiosyncrasies can be picked up versus simply reading. You may also ask why do I need the books if I can just buy the DVD? The way Ben correlates the movie and books in sync gives you a point of reference as he is teaching you HOW to train and practice better thru work and dedication. If you really do not care about unlocking your maximum shooting potential then you will not get as much as others will from the DVD. Ben points out very clearly he made GM through training and practice, not natural talent and that is the boat that the vast majority of shooters are in. If you are willing to put forth the effort and have the motivation to start shooting and getting gooder then Ben has laid the foundation for you in this almost 2 hour feature.

Viewers will get an in-depth look at dry-fire drills and what the main focus and goals are for that particular regiment. These will also coincide with live-fire demonstrations so the viewer can visualize how they apply to running a stage under the pressure of a timer. Lastly Ben creates a multitude of stages and teaches how one can look and breakdown a stage and run a course of fire in different ways and show the effects certain decisions can have on time and scoring. Not once during the movie did I get a sense of monotony or boredom as he kept it fast paced and fresh with content but maintaining a balance of slowing down to explain some of the more in-depth aspects of that particular drill or stage. Ben covers each section from all angles and does a great job of covering the different scenarios that could arise.

Whether you like him or hate him, love or loathe him, or despise his attitude or are a certified nuthugger, you will gain knowledge about what it takes to become a better competitor in the world of practical shooting. I realized that nothing will come easy and no shortcuts are available for those who want to take it to the next level. Ben has mastered the art of training and practicing and along with his books, podcasts, and other media outlets he has now performed the coup de gras to bring it all full circle. Training to Win is an eye-opening production and anyone who has doubts on whether it is for them or not must ask themselves do they want to get better or stay complacent? Ben has given everyone the formula for success here and outlined what it takes. Are you ready to compete like a super squadder or be the local match weekend champ or simply just improve? If the answer is YES then stop reading this review and get Training to Win NOW!!!",1393545600,3,3434,4.4720893141945774
6281610,5,B00IML5TZ0,"Training to Win by current USPSA Production Champion Ben Stoeger is a must have video for any shooter looking to increase his or her overall skill level in USPSA competitions.  Ben and fellow USPSA competitors Matt Hopkins and Chris Kozell demonstrate numerous live fire and dry fire drills tailored to help you improve immensely in USPSA competition.  Additionally, the video provides benchmark drill times to strive for, which I think is key to helping one push his or her boundaries to excel.  Lastly, the video explores different ways to shoot and analyze USPSA type competitive stages.  The video is fun and moves along smoothly from one drill to the next, alternating between live fire and dry fire drills, to keep the pace moving.  If you love to compete this is the video to help you improve.  However, that is not the only merit  this video brings to the table in my opinion.  If you truly want to become more proficient with a handgun, this video can give you the tools to become better.  It does so because the drills focus on key techniques like speed, accuracy, and movement.  For instance, I know I will be working many of these drills from conceal carry, so I become more adept at drawing and movement from a concealment holster, rather than just my competitive holster.  On a final note, this video does not start with handgun fundamentals, but rather assumes the person has some training/skills with a handgun.  For fundamentals check out Ben's earlier book Practical Pistol-Fundamental Techniques and Competition Skills, or one of his other fine books.",1393286400,3,1570,4.8830188679245285

8643363,5,B00IML5TZ0,"Another straight forward product from Stoeger that just plain works if you integrate it in to your training.

Not a beginner DVD by any means, but a DVD that takes it to the next level if you are trying to get better at practical shooting.

The best part of the video is the way it's broken down, dry fire, live fire and stage application. Shows you what and how to use your training time effectively.

I also love that there are different shooters and they make mistakes! That's right it's not just a video of perfection, these guys are human and you can relate to them. Nice touch!

Not like any other DVD you will find on the market, you will want this one in your library!",1396310400,,676,4.299212598425197
8643364,5,B00IML5TZ0,"Training To Win is USPSA National Production Champion Ben Stoeger's latest in a series of works on improving technical performance for competitive shooting, particularly USPSA. I opted to buy the download from Vimeo, which was very convenient.

It was a very enjoyable video. I think Ben did a good job speaking directly to his target audience. He didn't cover the very basics that a viewer of this particular video probably already knows. Instead it is oriented toward those who already have at least a basic level of skill and already compete, and want to improve their performance in USPSA competition. More fundamentally, that means to improve the technical skills that underlie a good USPSA performance.

After the introduction, the main body of the video starts off a lot like Ben's class starts - by shooting a stage and analyzing the choices that were made. It then covers some foundational aspects of safe and effective dry fire, and gets right into the very important and recurring dry fire-live fire loop, interspersed with related stages.

Training To Win takes an orderly approach in showing a stage that emphasizes a certain skill, shooting that stage a few different ways and comparing the results, then goes to a dry fire setting to do the foundational work of developing and refining that skill, and then finally takes it back to live fire to test and validate what's been built in dry fire. This is the dry fire-live fire loop Ben is well known for, and is a pattern repeated throughout Training To Win. This whole system is oriented toward what an average person, who cannot afford tons of ammo or range time, can do to bring their skills to a high technical level.

If you've taken Ben's class, many of the drills shown in Training To Win will be familiar, though the class has much more than what is shown in the video.

I liked that a range of skill levels were represented by the featured shooters. Ben was not the only shooter - Matt Hopkins (GM) and Chris Kozell (A at the time of filming) also demonstrate the drills and stages, and it broadens the perspective offered to the viewer.

Training To Win frequently references Ben's other works and shows where in those works the viewer can find additional information on the drill being shown. Training To Win is presented as part of a larger body of work, though it certainly stands on its own too.

The production quality was very good. It was edited and mixed in a stylish way that I didn't find annoying, and I often do find that kind of editing annoying in an instructional video. An element they managed to make work was cutting from one camera shot to another mid-action. For example, I have seen instructional videos with other top shooters, and there are parts where I am trying to discern finer points of their draw or some other technique, but as soon as their hands start to move the camera cuts to a close-up of their strained face and I can't see what I needed to. Training To Win employs similar editing at times, but keeps the cameras where they need to be to still allow me to see what I was looking for.

It may be an overly picky point, but I did appreciate how viewers' potential safety concerns were addressed right away at the beginning by noting that remote cameras were used for the many uprange views of the shooting.

I love how Ben embraces the negative aspects of his public image and has fun with it. The air humping in the outtakes was funny.",1394150400,6,3445,4.634426229508197
8643365,5,B00IML5TZ0,"Training to Win DVD - Ben Stoeger

First off I am a 20-year veteran of pistol competitions. I have shot USPSA, IDPA, NRA Handgun Silhouette, NRA Service Rifle and Bulls eye. I am NRA certified instructor in Pistol, In-Home self-defense and an NRA Range Safety Officer. I am a Concealed Weapons Instructor in the state of California and have been match director of over 50 matches since the late 1980's.

I had previously ordered Ben's eBook, Champion Shooting - A Proven Process for Success at Any Level. I found the book to be good, but did not like the Kindle format. It read well, but was difficult to take to the range and not easy to use in the dry fire area.

I next purchased Ben's book: Skills and Drills for the Practical Shooter. I found it to be extremely helpful and full of good drills and advice. This book tied together the dry fire needed with the drills designed to improve your actual performance in competition.

When the video, Training to Win became available I chose to download it directly to my Mac, a task that is not without issues, but I believe those issues are related to the Mac OS. I worked my way through them and now everything is fine, in fact I couldn't be more pleased. The entire process took about 25 minutes over a standard high-speed cable connection including my false starts due to not understanding the steps required. It was well worth the effort, the ability to watch the video on all my devices is terrific.

The video is the absolute best teaching aid I have been able to find in my years of training and being trained. The content flows smoothly and is laid out in a perfect fashion. Every live fire stage is backed up with an appropriate dry fire exercise and a reference to his previously printed instruction. There are 3 different shooters performing every task allowing you see their individual differences and observe the fundamentals as they each perform them. Even though each shooter may move or draw slightly differently, in the end they each perform the basics in the same way. The grip, draw, sight picture and trigger control are all covered.

Ben sets up stages of different sizes allowing you see exit and entry strategies as well as where and when to perform reloads. You are able to watch which targets are engaged first and which targets you should engage while exiting. In other stages shooting on the move is compared to posting up and the reasons for selecting one strategy over another is discussed and then demonstrated.

Being able to see these live examples holds a huge advantage over just the written word alone. It is also great to see dry fire done on video, many times the descriptions in the books made the process seem more complicated than it actually is.

Overall, the video Training to Win when combined with his latest book Skill and Drills make an excellent course for improving your competitive shooting. Combined with a solid practice schedule and a training journal any shooter will improve using these tools.",1393718400,11,2996,4.682509505703422
8643366,5,B00IML5TZ0,"Ben is joined by two other shooters in this video to teach some skills that most of us need.  This is a great video for a number of reasons.  I like how Ben shows a number of different stages, then shoots each stage along with GrandMaster shooter Matt Hopkins and A Class shooter Chris Kozell.  He then discusses how each of them shot the stage and offers some suggestions on breaking down the stage in a faster, more efficient manner.

Each of the stages shot are also referenced to the page numbers of his dry fire books.  So I can go to the book and set up that stage for dry fire practice.  Those dry fire drills also have explanations as to what skills they are used to improve and why.  So this video is really an excellent companion video for those books, which if you are a serious shooter or want to be one, you should have those books too.  There is a lot to learn there.

Another thing I like about the video is that Ben gives suggested times for each of these stages.  You also get to see his times, along with the other two shooter's times.  I really feel that seeing other shooters doing things a bit differently really shows that there are many ways to play this game, but some ways might be a touch faster.

The technique Ben uses of analyzing how and why a stage or drill is shot in a certain way I found to be very helpful.  This sport, if you want to advance, is all about analyzing what you are doing, making it faster and more efficient, and practicing.  A lot.

This is a great video to add to my collection and I am sure I will continually go back to it.",1393632000,8,1577,4.175496688741722
