8574361,4,B00BUWD76Q,"I was somewhat disappointed with ""in the cut"". not what I expected. not for kids. quite a bit more sex than I expected. so that one gets about two and a half stars from me. Now, TRAPPED, gets 4 and a half. great suspense movie. there you have kevin bacon, as the bad guy again, he does bad guys good. suspense. drama, Only reason, I bought this Blue Ray, is because is the ONLY way you can get TRAPPED in Blue Ray!!. I had it in DVD already.",1379203200,,441,4.0227272727272725
8574362,3,B00BUWD76Q,"I shamelessly purchased this twofer for the nude scenes of Meg Ryan in the ""In the Cut""  half of this two pack, hoping the  bluRay processing would clarify some of the murkiness of those scenes.  To its credit it is Jan Campion's unrated version  but it seems her vision was to purposely film these...and in fact much of the indoor scenes of this movie in subdued lighting.  I actually enjoyed the other feature - Trapped (with Charlize Theron) -more  although neither movie  showcased  the  actors at their best.  That said, the BluRay treatment did offer a decent picture with clear dialogue.",1374883200,16,594,4.792079207920792
