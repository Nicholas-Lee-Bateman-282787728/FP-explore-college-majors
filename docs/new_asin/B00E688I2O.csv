5891975,3,B00E688I2O,"This anime started out good. Each member of the gang had a Tarot card power, which was a creative idea. The leader of the Arcana Family has decided to retire and his successor must win a set of duels. As part of the successor's prize, he throws in his daughter, Felicitia. However, Felicitia isn't going to agree to her father's decision so easily.

It could of been a good show, so I gave it 3 stars, but it felt like the people who made this knew there wouldn't be a second season and gave up on the show halfway through. The ending was completely obvious and lacked action even though the characters were dueling. The story was somewhat incomplete too. I still had quite a few questions unanswered. I ended up disappointed and unimpressed.",1384560000,7,742,4.537313432835821
8601805,4,B00E688I2O,I love that this was dubbed and I didn't have to read then watch. It was hilarious and I just wish it had more episodes to go with it!,1523664000,,134,3.6551724137931036
8601806,4,B00E688I2O,"watching the first and last episode makes a decent short movie, otherwise it is a mediocre (3 star) at best series.",1483142400,,115,4.523809523809524
8601807,3,B00E688I2O,"Having a love of both anime and the Italian language, I was pretty interested in an anime that had an obviously Italian title and wondered what take the anime could have, where it was based and whether it was based on an actual event, historical fiction.
After watching a few of the dub episodes, I must warn you all. The voice actors and actresses obviously don't know the Italian language, or was a speaker of it even remotely involved in the dubbing process. I'm not sure if they based the pronunciation on the Japanese version or not. Either way, there were certain words that were not pronounced the way they were supposed to be pronounced.
That bothered me.
Other than that, the story and the concept of the first few episodes was really interesting. I liked the idea of powers based on tarot cards, as well as the story line revolving around a family who is essentially the mob. However, after the third or fourth episode, where Felicitia's father announces the duello, things start playing out like a reverse harem anime, and that bothered me as well.
Besides that, the art of the series was very nice, the backgrounds very well fleshed out and the style pleasing to the eye.
The voice acting, on the other hand left a lot to be desired. While the main characters and any named character usually had a decent voice actor, there were a few background characters that sounded like they were voiced by amateurs or a random person off the street.",1452384000,,1450,4.624031007751938
8601808,4,B00E688I2O,"This isn't a bad anime, but it's not a great one either. It's about a beautiful island where special young people have cards granting them special powers. The truth is that the anime has some interesting ideas and it's FAR better than a kiddy Yu-Gi-Oh type show. It had some interesting plot twists, but the ending was pretty bad. Ultimately the fighting and spell casting was for nothing.

Would I recommend this anime? Yes, but there are others that are better.",1424044800,,463,4.716049382716049

8601810,2,B00E688I2O,"The reason for the poor rating is the ""dub"".  Could have gotten random folks off the street to give a better performance.  If you do watch it, switch to subtitles w/Japanese.

Pretty plain, poorly executed, and lots of flaws, but nowhere near as bas a ""Flame of Recca"".

EDIT:

I laughed, I cried, I kissed $45 goodbye.

After WASTING an hour of my life, my advice is to skip it.",1396137600,,379,4.3428571428571425
8601811,1,B00E688I2O,"It has a terrible dub, barely worth watching. With a story just as terrible. Whole story is the ""family"" has a tournament to fight for daughter's hand. But has to beat old boss, no one does, The End. With all filler episodes that are just to kill time, except a few mins on last episode. Just awful!!!",1393632000,,301,4.298245614035087
8601812,4,B00E688I2O,The main problem people have with this anime is that they feel deceived. The first episode starts off action packed and looks like a promising action anime...but that is far from accurate. While there are moments of action it is far from being an action anime. The story is enjoyable but a little slow to start off. The characters are all original and have great chemistry with the other characters. There are some original ideas that make this anime really enjoyable. My suggestion is that you go into this story not expecting certain things; just flow with the story and you will be immersed into an enjoyable journey with the Arcana Family!,1391126400,4,643,4.75
8601813,2,B00E688I2O,"The premise of the story basically is about a group of people who become part of this large ""family"" that uses cards that houses a unique power of various elements, abilities, etc. Apparently one of them will succeed Ill Mundo who is the boss of the group and head the family into a new direction. It wasn't a bad premise, but just executed pretty bad. I can't really fault the characters. In fact I thought they were decent, somewhat done over (like in many animes), but done well; likable at least. The fault really likes in the story telling and direction. After about 6 or 7 episodes it feels like the directors pretty much said well screw the story we are moving into this now!!! and completely compressed the entire thing in like 3 episodes. The quality of the direction really suffered. The ending was terrible. It was boring and just did not leave a last or satisfying impression. Every thing remained the same! I was extremely disappointed. In all it could have been pretty good, but just like the other reviewer said, it's like they stopped trying and it just to garbage. Too bad. I give a 2 out 5.",1386460800,6,1108,4.517412935323383
8601814,5,B00E688I2O,I've seen this subbed a while back and it's a very good series. Decent romance and very good fighting scenes. Can't wait to see the dub.,1384819200,,136,4.269230769230769
