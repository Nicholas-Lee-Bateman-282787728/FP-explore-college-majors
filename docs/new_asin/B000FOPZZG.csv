2580949,4,B000FOPZZG,"Frank is laid off from his job and feels like his life is over. Slowly he gets himself together and decides to swim the English channel.

I liked Frank and his wife Joan a lot. I admired Joan wanting to try something different (learning to drive a bus). Frank's friends are interesting and seem like real people too.

My one complaint is there wasn't captioning. I had a difficult time understanding their accents occasionally and I felt I missed some important dialog.",1157673600,12,469,4.7073170731707314

At age 55 Frank finds himself laid off from his job...a job he has always used as a way to deal with his grief for a son who drowned as a child.  Frank is estranged from his remaining son, who is a house-husband.  Seeing a crippled boy swim, Frank is inspired to swim the English Channel.  In the end father and son are reconciled.  There are some funny moments too.",1157328000,6,427,4.3544303797468356
2580951,4,B000FOPZZG,"ON A CLEAR DAY is a wee Scottish film that is full to overflowing with heart and fine performances.  Writer Alex Rose and Director Gaby Dellal have managed to explore the psyches of the ordinary folk who face the crises of unemployment, of strained family relations and the fear of loss of pride in one's self and have created not only a sympathetic story with a message, but have also delivered their story with humor and a glint of the eye that makes the whole thing work - very well indeed.

Frank (Peter Mullen) watches as the last ship he will ever have worked on is launched as his wife Joan (Brenda Blethyn) and his son Rob (Jamie Sives), daughter in law Angela (Johdi May), and grandson twins celebrate the launching.  We soon learn that Frank is now jobless, that there is friction with his son Rob (who had been a twin but the other twin died at age 7) who doesn't have a traditional job but instead is a stay at home Dad.  Money is tight and Joan secretly is training to be a bus driver.  Franks cronies Eddie (Sean McGinley), Danny (Billy Boyd), and Norman (Ron Cook) see Frank slipping into depression.  Frank spends his time swimming at the public swimming pool and while there he sees three young physically challenged boys trying and by will power succeeding to swim.  Frank decides he needs to prove himself to his friends, family and himself and decides to swim the English Channel.  He enlists his buddy Chan (Benedict Wong) and eventually his cronies and they prepare for the challenging swim.  The manner in which this drive influences his marriage, his relationship with his son and his perception of himself is the driver for the very tender ending.

The cast is first class all the way, acting with that inimitable UK fashion of finding reality in the simplest of characters. The story is a joy to watch for its understated manner and for the glowing theme of the film.  Recommended for all audiences.  Grady Harp, July 06",1152835200,24,1946,4.592485549132948
2580952,4,B000FOPZZG,"Frank Redmond and his friends at the Glasgow Shipyard have just launched their last vessel. Now they have been laid off and are struggling to restart their lives after decades of sure employment. Frank is taking his new status particularly hard, and seems on the verge of a heart attack or nervous breakdown when he has an idea -- why not resurrect his self-esteem by swimming the English Channel?

""On a Clear Day"" boils down to a story we have seen a thousands times: the underdog who struggles valiantly against all odds to reclaim his dignity and (more importantly) learn about Life. Think ""The Bad News Bears,"" ""Calendar Girls"" and ""The Full Monty."" What rescues this film from the banality of repetition is the superb cast, the inclusion of neat motifs and the diversion of a few interesting subplots.

The main subplot relates to an unresolved tragedy in Frank's family that keeps him from being opening up to his son. Then, Frank's wife is secretly trying to get her bus-driving license to supplement the diminished family income, something she doesn't want Frank to find out.

There's not much suspense in the film -- in the sense that only a completely boorish or devilishly artsy director would withhold some form of ultimate triumph -- but it's fun watching this cast of misfits get there. These include the Chinese cook who can't stand up to abuse from his customers and suppliers; the goofy young lad (Billy Boyd in a post-LOTR/Pippin role) who wants (but can't manage) to be just like Frank; and the middle-aged man equally afraid of women and sailing. The strained relationship between Frank (Peter Mullan) and his son Rob (Jamie Sives) is exquisitely painful, and unfolds through marvelous scenes in which neither says a word, but in which the audience knows exactly what each is thinking and feeling. A phenomenal piece of acting, writing and editing that raises this film from a hum-drum 3 stars to a more exalted 4.",1148774400,37,1935,4.83987915407855

2580963,5,B000FOPZZG,"On a Clear Day is one of my favorite feel good movies, where if you're down in the dumps and need a pick me up, it really does the job in my brightening my mood by the end of the movie. Its a pretty bleak story in the beginning, but, without giving away the ending, its one of those happy movies that makes my eyes water a bit in the end, but in a good way.

This is the movie that made Peter Mullan one of my favorite actors. He goes through a wide range of changes in the movies, but can also be very stoic when the story calls for it. Its a shame hes not more well-known. Brenda Blethyn is a also pretty great and is probably more well-known as an actress. Billy Boyd from The Lord of the Rings has a smaller part, but hes definitely the comedy relief to me in the movie. He fits his roll well.

Its one of those movies where if you need to motivate yourself to achieve a goal, it makes you feel like its actually possible, even if the end result isn't what you thought it would really be. There will be set backs and confusion, and maybe even some resentment from other people, but if you put enough effort into what you set out for, youll find what you really needed in the end. I like to watch it at least once a year, just because I love the feeling when I reach the end of the movie.",1468713600,,1291,3.9806949806949805

2580966,4,B000FOPZZG,"I watched this with my spouse; it is a sweet movie, although it denigrates everyone who is not elderly. The two younger men are ludicrous stereotypes, one of which is a total moron and the other a brutish icon of machismo, played off quite funnily being a stay home dad. They punctuate a story mostly about retired (or very close to retirement) pensioners (since they are Brits, not Americans).

But the most surprising part was seeing George Bush swim the English Channel. Okay, so I know it's not actually George Bush, but it looked so much like him, in so many scenes that I kept cracking up during the movie.  It probably isn't noticed much in the UK, after all who there really cares about American politicians. But if you are an American you should watch it, it puts a bit of a comical (yet unintended) spin on many of the scenes.

Did anybody else see the uncanny resemblance?

I did enjoy the movie quite a bit so I am giving 4 solid, well-earned stars.",1466208000,,961,4.474285714285714

2581021,4,B000FOPZZG,"While beginning to watch Pride and Prejudice for the hundredth time, I stumbled across a movie preview of On A Clear Day. Intrigued, I bought a used copy since Redbox didn't have it, and sat down to watch it. It's quite encouraging and different.

On A Clear Day stars many names and some familiar faces like Billy Boyd (Lord of the Rings). Frank loses his job after an unknown amount of years as a foreman of a ship building company. It naturally brings him low. On A Clear Day starts out slow and for a moment I am trying too hard to figure out what's wrong. At first, I thought Frank retired. I later learn the company let him go. His agony over the loss affects everyone. It's one more loss after the death of his son to drowning years before.

The loss of a son divides Frank and his remaining married son. His living son is a stay at home dad, but thinks his father doesn't like him because he lived and his brother died. We later learn that is not the case. Frank's wife, Joan, is also hiding something from Frank. Joan secretly tries out to be a bus driver. She's afraid to tell him because Frank might think it has something to do with him when it has everything to do with her. The overall theme comes out in each situation.

The theme is overcoming failure. This British film does an excellent job of it as Frank moves into the next plot; that is training to swim the English Channel. Typical of British humor, it is subtle. It's a feel good movie and well-done in spite of the slow beginning. I wish more films existed like this that make you want to do something equally as difficult as swimming the English Channel. I gave this film four stars.",1380326400,,1658,4.32475884244373

Peter Mullan plays Frank with great integrity.  Brenda Blethyn plays his wife.

2581042,5,B000FOPZZG,"I've watched this film three times so far.  It stays with me, and I mull over the themes and the relationships, and I think about Frank, the main character.

The reviewers who say this is a film about an unemployed man struggling to find his self-esteem have it all wrong.  Those reviewers are shallow thinkers.  On A Clear Day is about soooo much more.  There are other things to life than work, you know.  People throw themselves into their jobs in a search for meaning in their lives, and they will remain in a certain niche for a long time sometimes when they feel they are making a meaningful contribution of some sort.  Just as Frank stayed working at the shipyard for 36 years, so Frank's wife Joan was a housewife for all those years.  Joan didn't find what she needed in her housewife role, especially after Frank lost his job.

Frank losing his job was like the stick thrust into the beehive for the entire cast of characters.  Suddenly they're ALL reflecting on their lives, ALL looking for something more.  They all begin to sort through what it is that will give them self-esteem and meaning in life.  Frank is the catalyst, a normal man who decides to take on an amazing challenge, and who draws all his friends and family along with him without even meaning to.

Frank's swim is sort of a Forrest Gump journey in a way.  Overwhelmed with emotions, Forrest just needs to run, so he runs and runs and runs.  In fact he runs across the United States.  In the same way, Frank just needs to swim and swim and swim, until he has swimmed himself out.  He won't find his drowned son out there in the English Channel, but he swims anyway.

In the movie Twister, the main character Jo is fascinated with tornadoes because she lost her father to one when she was little.  But her husband finally yells at her that getting herself killed in a tornado won't bring her father back.  Similarly, Eddy yells to Frank that his son who drowned is not out here in the middle of the English Channel. Frank didn't even realize that that's what he was subconsciously thinking and hoping.  How extremely difficult it was for him to go through that struggle and have that epiphany 17 miles into his swim.  Finally Frank screams out his pain at losing his son.  Most probably he had never done that before.  How traumatic for all of us to watch him almost kill himself in this swim, and we begin to realize that he is doing it because his pain has built up to an unbearable level.

The ending of the movie is wonderful, but before the swim we also see all of Frank's friends, as well as his wife, transforming themselves, each one, into someone they themselves can like and be proud of.

Lastly, two small comments about the thick Scottish accents and the cold, cold water:  1) If you are not Scottish, it's really a must to watch this movie with subtitles.  I want so badly to understand what they're saying, and the more you watch it, if you watch it more than one time, you become more and more familiar with the accents, but without subtitles you are likely to be lost.  Netflix, unfortunately, doesn't provide subtitles with this movie.

2) I know that it was very difficult for Peter Mullan to continuously go into that freezing cold water in order to make this movie.  I wonder somewhat why they didn't let him wear a wet suit.  But I have to agree that we see Frank's vulnerability and physical conditioning much moreso without a wet suit.  His little boy didn't have on a wet suit when he drowned, so why should his dad get to put one on when he goes hunting for him in the English Channel?  Not sure we would sympathize as much with a man in a wet suit.  So I thank you, Peter, for everything you went through to bring us this character.  I loved the film and everyone in it.  I LOVE the film, present tense, because I think about it as I go about my daily life.  It stays with me, and helps me grow as a human being.",1336003200,,3916,4.3875
2581043,5,B000FOPZZG,"I decided to stream this one thinking I could sort of watch it while surfing the Web but it turned out to be an awesome film that took away most of my attention. A 50 something man loses his job of 20 years plus in a shipping yard in Glasgow and falls into a deep depression. After a time he comes up with the idea to swim the English Channel as a symbolic way to regain his self esteem. His friends and family, who have their own issues, either help him or don't know about it until later (leading to further complications, of course). As the story progresses you find out why it's so unusual that of all the things to pick this man picks to swim the English Channel (i.e. a family tragedy). The tale has its ups and downs but its meant to be an inspirational story but as the hero progresses his victories begin to inspire his friends to do more with their lives. The relationship between the father and son is gradually revealed and poignant. This isn't something you watch for extreme dramatic points nor to see cars exploding. It's about the human heart in conflict and how sometimes we get past it.

2581047,4,B000FOPZZG,"""On A Clear Day"" is at heart the story about the struggles of regular people, and in the hands of a capable director & talented cast, this becomes more than just a predictable human drama. Instead, it engages the viewer and draws us into the story of these everyday people - eliciting our empathy and convincingly portraying the various facets of human relationships and struggles. The focal point of the story is Frank Redmond (played convincingly by Peter Mullan), a shipyard worker who has been laid off, and becomes 'lost' as a result, until he finds a new purpose, that of swimming the English Channel, no mean feat for an accomplished athlete, much less a middle-aged man. Frank is lucky in that he has a group of loyal friends who stick with him, providing him moral support and lots of encouragement, even when he is later assailed by doubts. The friends are played by among others, Billy Boyd (best known for his role as Pippin the hobbit in LOTR).

The story has many interconnected arcs - that of Frank's strained relationship with his son,Rob (Jamie Sives) who is a stay-at-home dad to twin boys. This has something to do with a tragedy in the past involving the death of Frank's other son. The talented Brenda Blethyn portrays Frank's wife, who tries desperately to pass a bus driver's exam so that she can supplement the family income, something that she keeps hidden from Frank. In the meantime, Frank doesn't tell his wife about his Channel crossing aspirations, which says a lot about the state of the couple's marriage.

There are many scenes in this movie that will resonate with viewers - the quiet confrontation between Frank's wife and Frank at the dining table, Rob's confrontation with Frank at the swimming pool, and one in particular which also tugs at the heartstrings - when Frank, almost at the point of giving up sits by the pool, watching a young boy with cerebral palsy dive into the pool and swim by himself, and experiences an epiphany - that his struggles are nothing compared to the great courage it takes the boy to get into the pool and not drown, swimming independently without help. ""On a Clear Day"" is a refreshing change from some of the lackluster, uninspired Hollywood drivel that pass off as movies these days. Recommended!",1260576000,,2268,4.753807106598985

2581049,4,B000FOPZZG,"When you're fiftyish and have just lost your job, what do you do next?

If you're Frank in ""On A Clear Day,"" then you swim the English Channel, and confront some nasty personal demons. This wee, warm Scottish flick does a great job balancing out comedy and melancholy, with a bit of family strife thrown in. It's just a small-scale, sweet little film.

A Scottish shipyard is laying off workers, and Frank (Peter Mullan) suddenly finds himself without a job. His wife Joan (Brenda Blethyn) starts training to be a bus driver, and his relationship with his son Rob (Jamie Sives) remains chilly, as it has been ever since his other son's death. Frank becomes increasingly depressed and antsy, unsure what to do next.

But while on a ""booze cruise"" with his friends, inspiration strikes -- he'll swim the Channel. He keeps his plans a secret from his family, but allows Chinese-Scot Chan (Benedict Wong) to be his trainer, with his pals as moral support. But his secret alienates his wife and son even further, and as he faces the biggest swim of his life, Frank will have to overcome his worst, most haunting memories of the sea.

""One Clear Day"" is basically a heartwarming little family dramedy, which avoids the usual cliches and schmaltz, even in scenes where it could have easily become goopy. It takes a pretty talented director to handle things like government layoffs and racism without being heavy-handed, or dealing with emotional trauma without being soppy about it.

The plot seems even more colourful against the grey skies and seas of Scotland -- there are sad flashbacks and some melancholy moments, but Dellal balances it out with kooky good-ol'-lads comedy, such as Danny joyously careening around on a tiny motoboat. And the dialogue is nothing short of hilarious, whether it's bawdy jokes or banter (""Shark. Thirty-five footer."" ""Fell off my bike. Two-wheeler!"").

Mullan has a very challenging role -- his character has repressed his grief, and doesn't want to let anyone see his problems. So Frank is gruff, secretive, but has moments of unbridled delight. Blethyn and Sives round out the family beautifully, as Frank's loving wife and emotionally starved son -- the beach scene with the three of them is enchanting.

But the supporting cast is also great -- Jodhi May has a small, good role as Rob's wife, and Ron Cook and Sean McGinley are snappily solid as two of Frank's pals. And Billy Boyd simply steals every scene he's in, as the perpetually upbeat, charmingly troublesome Danny. But comedy isn't his only skill: his best scene would have to be when Danny sadly confesses that he's always wanted to be like Frank.

""On A Clear Day"" is a sweet, small Scottish movie with plenty of heart and joking-around, and the ability to warm your heart without turning your stomach. Definitely worth swimming to.",1252540800,,2826,4.872916666666667

It's five stars of pure enjoyment with a heart-hug ending.

We watched with the English subtitles on. Wendy's review stated that her copy had no captioning.  It does help with certain areas when the heavier British accent is hard to catch.  I didn't have to rely on it much but we watch a lot of British, Irish, Scottish, and BBC movies.  If you have a problem with that, make sure your purchase has the captions.

Yes, I agree with everyone, Frank (Peter Mullan)is an outstanding character and superbly casted.  But I also felt that his wife, Joan (Brenda Blethyn) also was excellent. Both of them display a drive within that spells inspiration to others in similar situations--that being, reaching an age when something else has to begin to mark life's milestone.

Another point of inspiration is the young little swimmer at the pool. If he's an actor that is not really handicapped then he deserves a major award for the acting.  If he's truly handicapped, then he deserves a bigger than major award for displaying his own true inspiration and for the accomplishments of doing the film. To his ability, sorry I don't know his name, I shout ""YES!""  As he did with each pool length.

You also will fall in love with the antics, and roles of the group of pals that assist Frank in the Channel swim attempt.  Each fellow seems to have their own personal ""channel"" to swim or face.  Will each succeed?  Did Frank and Joan?  I'll not be the spoiler.

""On a Clear Day"" will perk up any cloudy day.  Something for everyone.
