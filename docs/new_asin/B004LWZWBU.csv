4422097,5,B004LWZWBU,"LOVED IT! LAUGHED! Admittedly I feed backyard birds year-round. That does not deter the facts that this is a beautifully documented birding film with enough outdoor vistas to fill anyone's nest. Great music too, even from a couple of those old Beetles guys. The story (""true story, only the facts were changed"") is birds, and how many can one count in a year, i.e. A Big Year. It turns into an avid confrontational race between Brad (Jack Black) a nuclear power plant techie, Kenny (Owen Wilson) reining champ, & Stu (Steve Martin) corporate head who's trying to retire from success. Brad needs financial help from parents (Dianne Wiest & Brian Dennehy) since this quest is ultra expensive. Brad also, along the trail, gets the hots for peacock gorgeous Ellie (Rashida Jones). So did I.

Other family matters become sub-plots and drama in this comic race for the feather count. Kenny's wife Jessica (Rosamund Pike) makes any guy look the fool with her beautiful display as the beautiful birdhouse mate. Kenny dumbly leaves her home alone. Kenny tells her he's the ""Mozart"" of birders.  Stu gets a bit more moral support from wife Edith (Jo Beth Williams) and he does have a consciousness about business and family and occasionally falls from the hunt. There are some slapstick adventures in the rugged areas of North America due to the gung-ho style of the trio on their ""Big Year"" quests. Also enjoy the in-your-face bird tour boat captain, Annie Auklet (Angelica Huston) in a rare performance of a different specie. Plenty of other stars too. Not to mention hundreds of beautiful birds.

This is a FOWL film, but not fouled with lots of bad language, nudity, or other lower intellect modes often used to get comedy to work. Expect humor in wholesomeness, and the great outdoors. John Audubon would have loved to serve as an extra in this film. It is society endorsed. Makes one want to eat sunflower seeds with a grin.

There is some ending philosophy to the story. What is a win? Win at what cost? Even though 2 men lost, they seem to feel they were the ultimate winners. Biggest winner of The Big Year is birding fans. Raise those binoculars high, like a trophy.

At first I considered 4  stars, because the last 2 films I theater viewed was ""The Help"" and ""Courageous"", both being 5 . The Big Year is not as deep in theme as those two, but just as entertaining, thus my 5 stars. Enjoy with a ticket or DVD. My plan is to do both.

4422318,5,B004LWZWBU,"Prior to this film my knowledge of birding consisted of Miss Hathaway and her bird watching club on ""The Beverly Hillbillies"".  After watching this charming film I've developed a knew found respect for the fanciers of our fine feathered friends.  The film concerns three guys who take a year off from life as we know it, more or less, to partake in a Big Year which is a competition among birders to spot and photograph the most species of aviary.  Jack Black's character is a thirtysomething divorcee stuck in a dead end job whose dream is to partake in a Big Year.  Ditto for Steve Martin's high powered New York CEO who wants a Big Year before retiring to his family and grandchildren.  Owen Wilson's character's quest is more obsessive, however.  He's a professional birder out to protect his world record even at the cost of jeopardizing his marriage.  All three actors are in fine agreeable form here with complex nuanced turns all.  The fine work of the relatively numerous supporting cast is effective as well.  It's always good to see Brian Dennehy and Angelica Huston in top form.  Loved John Cleese's engagingly tongue-in-cheek narration of the film.  This one barely caused a ripple upon initial release in the Fall of 2011 probably a case of the studio not knowing how to market such an iconoclastic project.  Those bemoaning the dearth of quality films should look no further than this wonderful film.",1512864000,,1415,4.801652892561983

4422320,5,B004LWZWBU,This is an excellent movie. It gives a glimpse inside the life and activities of birders. It is loosely based on a book written by a birder; who would have thought birding was so serious and competitive. I would totally watch a reality show about the big year. I am not a birder but I love seeing the different species that make a pit stop in my backyard. I watched it because it is about bird watching and Steve Martin is in it.

4422326,5,B004LWZWBU,"Just watched The Big Year, starring Jack Black, Steve Martin & Owen Wilson, again, for maybe the 80th time.

Five years ago this month I watched it for the first time. And it changed my life. Sounds funny to say that about a movie. But it did.

It made me a birder.

Yes, I know that it is a strange, nerdy thing to be. But I was reflecting on what Ive seen over the past five years:

Ive seen albatrosses 40 miles off the coast of Northern California
Flycatchers at sewage treatment plants in Austin, Texas
Snowy Owls in Wisconsin and at Jones Beach
A Bald Eagle and I spent 20 minutes together, alone, in a frozen Minnesota fieldhe high up on a tree, me down below mesmerized
I watched American Oystercatchers burying their bright red beaks in a sand bar off the coast of Cape May
Ive stood in a field outside Utica, NY, wholly alone at dawn, watching Barn Swallows dance in the early morning sunlight
Ive hiked around a spider-infested path on High Island, Texas, watching tropical Cormorants in bright green scum covered water, dodging spiders larger than my hand, on the lookout for snakes and alligators
Ive been on ferries, spying seabirds
Ive clung to the granite sides of an overpass, sliding my feet across an ice-covered 8-inch wide ledge, 100 feet over a reservoir in Minnesota, so I could see an owl
Ive spent a day on a wildlife refuge in Kansas, and Ive spent a morning next to a fog-covered lake in Arkansas
Ive watched hundreds of thousands of Sandhill Cranes take flight at sunrise along the Platte River in Nebraska
Ive birded across the country, in over 30 states.
And, Ive spent time enjoy House Finches and House Sparrows play in my backyard, and Northern Cardinals in the snow on my patio.

Ive met a bunch of quirky, kind, friendly people who share this obsession. I cant imagine I would have ever hiked a mountain in Nevada as the snow fell, an hour after I played with a Greater Roadrunner in the desert, or wandered down a quiet road next to a farm outside of Buffalo, if it weren't for birding.

Ive seen more of America in the last 5 years than I did in a lifetime before that.

And I couldn't have done it without 2 things: the patience and support of my wife, who never fails encourage me.

And the movie, The Big Year.

For those of you who haven't seen it, if follows the true story of 3 guys trying to see the greatest number of different bird species in North America in a year. The story is funny, and touching. The photography is outstanding. It inspired me to get off the couch and go for a little hike in the Rockville Centre woods, where I saw my first woodpecker. I was hooked.

So as I mark my five-year anniversary as a birder, I say thank you to those who fight to preserve habitat for birds, thank you to the people who organized the festivals Ive attended, thank you to the kind, patient experienced birders who have helped me along. Thank you to my wife.

And thank you Jack Black, Steve Martin, Owen Wilson and all who made The Big Year. I hope you made some money. I hope you had fun making the movie. And I hope you know that your little comedy has changed at least one life for the better.",1504915200,11,3140,4.368782161234991

Parts of this film reminded me a bit of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""- there are some fun traveling bits that lead to the characters development. Also, I thought the chemistry between the three main characters was both entertaining and touching.

I think someone said it before, but the marketers of this film likely had a hard time finding a niche for this film. The trailer for this movie makes it seem more slapstick than it actually is. There are moments of reflective beauty in it and a positive message about friendship and faithfulness.

I had it on my watch list for a while, hemming and hawing about actually watching it. Honestly, by the description, it didn't sound like it would be that great.  I kept it on there for all three main stars.  I mean, those guys? They're all quite funny as well as good at being serious.
One night, the boyfriend and I were wanting to watch a movie.  I showed him the trailer for this, and he said let's try it.  We were both so blown away!  We agreed it was one of the best movies we've seen in a long time.
What's so refreshing about it for sure is that it's a really great movie that doesn't need any nudity, graphic violence (honestly, not sure if there was any violence at all), or foul language to be great!  That's amazing to have a movie now days like that.  (not that I'm a prude or anything. Just always still impressed when a movie can show it can still be done).  So, that being said, it's a great movie for anyone, young or old.  It's a great family movie, date night movie, well...anytime movie.  Who would have thought a movie centering around birding, huh? Please don't let that stop you from watching this gem!  It is far from boring.  The boyfriend and I were both surprised at how much suspense was in it and how it really got us both.  A few surprises for sure.  Also, many funny scenes as well as touching life lessons.  One of them learns a pretty hard lesson for sure.
Such a shame this didn't get a better chance at the box office.",1479945600,10,1555,4.249146757679181

Lots of great actors doing great acting, and my favourite is Jack Black as he doesn't play a typical Jack Black character.

The music is great too.  I wish I could find the soundrack on DVD but no luck so far.

Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin are a dream cast to say the least, while being wonderful actors by themselves together they are just plain awesome. It has beautiful scenery, awesome bird stuff, and by the end of it you'll probably wanna do a big year yourself.

By the time ""February"" rolled around I was checking my iPhone praying it wasn't filmed during a leap year.  Then I found myself mumbling (30 days has September, April, June, and November)....trying to keep myself entertained while I watched this Beta-of-a-Movie.

Alanis Morisette would have had a field day with this: a tremendous cast, big production budget ($40MM), multiple location shoots, and a pretty good (expensive) soundtrack, and the only thing missing was anything resembling a good movie.  Isn't it ironic?

In short, there was very little plot, no action, bad writing, and nothing to keep you entertained.  Even a gratuitous sex scene or car chase would have made this more palatable.

Look at the cover art; it's symbolic that they're all holding binoculars.  Not for birding but for distancing themselves from this god awful film.

Yeah...and I got the ""Extended Edition"" which should have been retitled ""Add Inult to Injury Edition.""",1473638400,2,1041,5.112426035502959

4423111,5,B004LWZWBU,"What a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Believe it or not, Jack Black, Steve Martin, and Owen Wilson all underplay their roles to perfection in what would seen the most unlikely of storylines...birders trying to spot and identify as many birds in one calendar year as possible.

The set up?  The reigning champion (Wilson) is nervous that someone will outdo his record-breaking 'big year"" and he sets off to set a pace that few if any other birder could match.  The challengers are a corporate legend (Martin) who opts for retirement in favor of pursuing his own ""big year"", and a nobody who is a techno-savvy upstart who though an ardent birder has to pursue his ""big year"" part time while he works and juggles misunderstanding and even contempt from his father who doesn't understand what a big year is all about...each of whom tries to keep their planned ""big year"" secret from the others.

This is a fantastic look at birding, ""big years"", and three extremely different yet affable characters.  Wilson plays the anti-hero, the proven warrior on a pedestal that others would love to knock off.  Martin plays the self-made man with nearly unlimited resources at his disposal who is grasping what will most likely be his last serious chance at a ""big year"".  Black plays the likable yet frumpy upcoming challenger.

There is fantastic chemistry including the main characters as well as minor ones that makes this movie work.  Wilson's wife, Martin's wife and son, Black's parents and wishful thinking (on his part) love interest.

If you haven't yet seen ""Big Year"" you should do yourself a major favor and set aside two hours, grab a snack and a soda, and settle in for fun.

5 solid stars.  Who'd have guessed that a movie about birding could be this engaging?",1451952000,,1764,4.820598006644518

4423259,4,B004LWZWBU,"Written by Howard Franklin, based on the book by Mark Obmascik, and directed by David Frankel, this movie is a must-see-PG for those who appreciate good, clean adult comedy. (I believe the only sex scene happened between two consenting eagles.) The film is brilliantly typecast, and stars Steve Martin, Jack Black, and Owen Wilson. It's a not-so-typical male identity crisis movie, with great actresses like JoBeth Williams, Anjelica Huston, Rashida Jones and Dianne Wiest, who (disappointingly) pretty much only act as trophies and cheerleaders. One may think a movie about spotting as many birds in a year as possible would be a yawn, but it's not. It's funny, and well worth a watch.",1446076800,,686,5.079646017699115

4423462,4,B004LWZWBU,"The Big Year / Rated PG for naked birds everywhere.
  Every now and then filmmakers find themselves in a dilemma about marketing their film, especially with an arcane subject.  What they try to do is sell what they think the general public wants to see but is not the film they made.  The previews for The Big Year seem to be selling a lame, pratfall filled comedy of manly competition.  One scene from the preview is not even in the movie.
  The arcane subject of TBY is bird watching.  The three stars of TBY are Jack Black as a 36 year old hard working but obsessed birder (and the films narrator).  Steve Martin plays the older birder trying to retire from his mega billion dollar company so he can spend more time looking through binoculars.  Owen Wilson plays the World Champion Birder with a one year record of 733 sightings.  I am pretty sure Ive seen at least four, but wouldnt swear to it.  I know that most of them can fly and many are very tasty.  SM and JB decide they want to have a Big Year and break the OW record.  He decides not to let them.
  Traveling is a must for Birders and they do.  While filmed in Atlanta, Miami and Canada, the location subtitles indicate a much wider range of locales.  The guys will do anything to spot a new species.  Skipping meals, ignoring family and even passing up a Super Bowl is not beyond their desire to spot the most birds.
  Adding to the story are vet actors Brian Dennehy, Dianne Wiest, JoBeth Williams and Anjelica Huston.  Theodore Shapiro adds a big score which is the right touch of adventure to the big outdoors on display.
  While the previews misrepresent this film in an effort to sell it to us, what they really need is word of mouth.  I, for one, am here to open mine and tell you this is a neat film.  The humor is appropriately low key for the true message about obsession, sacrifice, friendship and relationships. If you want to be a champion birder, youll learn from the films three main characters what they were willing to give up and what they learn from their Big Year.  I learned a lot about birds.  My next visit to KFC will be much different than my last one.  The main thing this film has are great performances by the lead actors.  By films end I really liked and admired all of them.
  Back in 2000 I went to a film with low expectations but it
turned out to be a big surprise.  Minnie Driver starred in the Bonnie Hunt movie Return to Me.  It was beautifully written, funny and wonderfully human.  The Big Year is the same experience except with feathers.
Rated 3.5 out of 4.0 Yellow Bellied Sapsuckers.  Maybe they had Blue Bellies.  Maybe not.  They flew away in a big hurry.",1436832000,14,2662,4.357142857142857

4423676,5,B004LWZWBU,"If you are a birder, you have probably already seen this, or when people find out you are a birder they will ask you IF you have seen it. It is no Winged Migration. It is a comedy about birding.  You kind of can't miss with Jack Black, Steve Martin, and Owen Wilson as a comedy team. There are also great performances by Brian Dennehy, Dianne Wiest, and Rosamund Pike before she became Gone Girl. If you are not a birder, you may not get all the jokes poked at bad birding manners.  But the story line about finding what is really important in life and going for it, as well as the price paid for doing one thing to the exclusion of what is important in life.

4423894,3,B004LWZWBU,"The idea for THE BIG YEAR sounds fascinating; the fact that people spend most of their time and energy trying to spot as many birds as possible during a calendar year offers fascinating possibilities for the exploration of obsession, as well as including some wonderful footage of the birds themselves.

While David Frankel's film manages to fulfill the second requirement, it fails notably on the first.  Rather than exploring the characters of its three protagonists (Jack Black, Owen Wilson, Steve Martin), it relapses into a familiar tale of the ugly duckling with little money (Black) taking on the big boys (Wilson, Martin) in the Big Year competition.  No one is initially prepared to admit that they are actually participating; but when they do, Black and Martin form an alliance against the cocky, arrogant Wilson, who believes that he is obviously the best, his position unchallengeable.

THE BIG YEAR includes some stunning photography - by Lawrence Sher - as well as some picture-postcard views of various locations in the United States.  On the whole, however, the picture descends into sentimentality, especially in its depiction of the relationship between Black's character and his crusty father (Brian Dennehy), or the way in which Martin's character becomes so human that he is prepared to give up an opportunity to become the president of 3M worldwide.  The ending is wearily predictable, although there are a few incidental laughs along the way.",1420588800,,1465,5.186440677966102

4423985,4,B004LWZWBU,"The Big Year reminds me of many an 80's film that was a sort of reflection of life for the characters in the movie development light comedy.  With regular stars of high laugh count comedy movies in the three main roles, you could easily pick this one up going by the cover and expect it to be non stop laughs throughout. Throw in the fact you've got minor roles or actors who appear in TV comedy sitcoms such as The Big Bang Theory and Community as well also reinforces this expectation.  It's not really a comedy movie though, and I have no problem with actors wanting to do something different to what they're normally in when given the opportunity and Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson all deliver their roles extremely well. However I have to say I'm still a little disappointed it wasn't a stronger level comedy as well.

The basic plot revolves around bird watching extremists who compete in some bird magazine's competition to see the highest number of different types of birds in a year inside the USA.  They for plot convenience often arrive at the same place, at the same time as their competitors, catching the same bus, plane, ferry or whatever.  The general population also seems a little more into this hobby, especially the competition than they are in real life including the media.  The bird watching competition is like a major sporting event in this movie.

The plot is pretty predictable but the journey is a pleasant one there.  With three physical comedy type actors perhaps a comedy writer who could have added a scene or two for each actor which may have enhanced some of the scenes and changed this from just a feel good movie with great scenery and wildlife, into a comedy feel good movie.",1415664000,,1722,4.622950819672131

4423991,5,B004LWZWBU,"This is a great movie but I am a bird watcher, not a birder like the characters in this story but a wanna be birder. To do what the characters in this movie are doing would be a dream year for me.  I read the book, by the same name,
""The Big Year: A Tale of Man, Nature, and Fowl Obsession"" by Mark Obmascik, that this fictional movie was based upon and the movie stays true to the values of the actual birders of the non fiction book.  The movie is pretty loose with the Owen Wilson character from the actual birder in Obmascik's non fiction account.  The competition was intense and that big year was unlike any year for birding that will ever likely again be seen. The weather was helpful driving migratory birds from Asia and Europe that are not normally seen in North America. This movie does a wonderful job of catching a true birders passion for observing and counting birds. From the delight of enjoying the creatures' beauty and majesty to the thrill of triumph of besting their competitors. It is truly a human experience story, ranging along the track of human traits. It is a story that portrays the success of personal human accomplishment.",1413676800,,1153,4.507177033492823

4424028,4,B004LWZWBU,This movie was not at all what I was expecting the first time I watched it.  The most laugh-out-loud moments of the movie make it into the trailor but it actually has a lot more heart than most comedies made by Jack Black or Owen Wilson.  I enjoyed watching these guys tour the United States and all the beautiful scenery you see.  It's a very laid back and enjoyable movie that is just nice to watch not because of some intriguing plot or gross-out comedy but because there are some very human stories interspersed with laughs and music and birds.  It was on HBO frequently about a year ago and I watched it every time it was on.  I even got my dad and sister watching it when they came to visit one day.  It's one of those surprisingly good movies that you don't expect to enjoy as much as you do once it's over.  I recommend it.,1412294400,,831,4.2215189873417724

4424069,4,B004LWZWBU,"This movie was good for several reasons which I will explain but overall it only deserves a 4 because it just wasn't that funny even though it has three successful comedians in it. The good things are that there is not bad language, no nudity, no violence, etc like there is in most movies now. All three lead comedians did their parts well but I felt like the script or director just did not allow them to bring out their real funny sides. It seems to be that they were expected to be more serious. SPOILERS: The storyline is solid and shows how people can disappoint others or go in debt, etc while they stubbornly try to fulfill their dreams. These dreams might not be accepted by loved ones and this movie shows those reactions. Or in the case of Jack, his character found love with a woman who shared the same interests. I am glad that most of this movie does not deal with romance, but it does show the pros and cons of having a unique and perhaps obsessive interest or hobby. The good aspects of the movie outweigh the lack of comedy, and there is some clever parts of the story. Also, in one scene there were two bald eagles holding hands (talons) and spiraling together towards the ground as if they were dancing together or playing. It was absolutely amazing. I like Eagles a lot and I didn't know they did this. Nesher  in Hebrew is Eagle. It was worth the rent price just to learn this one fact. Near the end of the movie it explains some things and it did not say it but it seems this might be based on a true story.",1407888000,,1529,4.272413793103448

4424214,4,B004LWZWBU,Relaxing movie.  I never knew this contest even existed.  I wonder if the actors now bird at all? The birds were beautiful too.,1399939200,,127,4.478260869565218

4424216,5,B004LWZWBU,"You don't have to be a bird lover to enjoy this movie.  It is good entertainment for all from my 7 year old to my retired parents.  It follows a couple folks who have an unnatural obsession with birds and their exploits.  Showing some of the best and worst of men, but all in a funny (and clean) way.  The camera work is excellent, the casting is great, and the stories that are told during the course of the movie are fun.",1399507200,,423,4.121951219512195
4424217,5,B004LWZWBU,"While this movie did not receive critical acclaim when it was first in theaters, I found it quite enjoyable. All three of the lead actors do wonderful jobs. What I liked most is that it really isn't a story of good and bad. All three have reasons for their bird obsessions and all come across as very human.",1399248000,,307,4.310344827586207
4424218,4,B004LWZWBU,It was OK.  It was a sappy story and not what I had anticipated.  I was hoping for more hardcore birding.,1399161600,,105,3.9523809523809526

Everyone I've seen it with also enjoyed it and I believe some of them have bought it as well. As to the actual movie: what I like about it is the fact that I felt comfortable watching it with my nieces and it didn't have any vampires, werewolves, gore, or flashing tatas.  The Big Year was a lovely change from the other movies that have been coming out that are so over the top - a breath of fresh air if you will. I wish they made more movies like this.  It has a cute story line, nice messages, and didn't have the formulaic aspects many big budget movies go for.  This is fun to watch and kept my attention, especially with the beautiful birds that were showcased.  The Big Year made me smile and I found myself laughing on several occasions and will definitely be watching it again.",1397692800,,906,4.280701754385965

4424246,5,B004LWZWBU,"who would have thought that a movie about bird watching of all things would be interesting. the bird aspect is good, but the story of the three main characters and what this means to their lives is well done. probably the best thing Jack Black will ever do, next to Bernie. Steve Martin is excellent too.",1397001600,,304,4.446428571428571

I need to buy this one for my boss so he can understand why I need to jet off on the spur of the moment. LOL.  I don't even like Jack Black but I really like his character in this movie.  I have even started my big year list.  100 birds so far. Too bad I don't have the money to travel around like they do.

4424314,5,B004LWZWBU,"Myself, my daughters and grandkids loved this movie!  I was expecting more of a comedic show but was pleasantly surprized by its charm and warmth. It has certainly sparked an interest in birdwatching (excuse me, ""birding""). All performances are great. If you are looking for an action packed or fall down laughing movie, this is not for you. If you like an interesting, sweet, and at times uplifting movie, try this one!!",1393027200,,421,4.847222222222222
4424315,5,B004LWZWBU,"...and it captures some of the mindset of ""serious"" birders, those people who frantically seek ""numbers"".  The scene in Attu is perfect...it reminds me of an event I witnessed in 1975 in Arizona, in which a newly wed husband left his wife in their car in the desert.  When she complained to me that he had done this to find a blue grosbeak, my only response was ""which way did he go?"".  If you're a birder or even a bird watcher like me, and have a sense of humor, you should find this movie quite funny.",1392940800,,504,4.229166666666667

Three guys are chasing each other, pulling pranks, as they all chase birds all over the U.S.  But under that faade, there is a story of individual growth and change in each of them.  To young people, this movie may seem silly.  To an older person, especially one interested in ornithology to some extent, this was a real joy.

It also has very broad appeal - it can be seen by all members of the family, which is important to people like myself with young kids. The themes it touches on are great: competition, the cost of achieving, the importance of spouse/family, the connection of father and son - lots of universal themes that appeal to both men and women (although of course the three principal characters are men). Don't expect a comedy, but at the same time, I found the film very humorous in a realistic way in terms of how they were reacting to their character's story lines. No stupid one-liners here, only super-strong acting and comedy based on good situational acting. Great movie, and so unfairly ignored!",1389225600,,776,4.7555555555555555

The writers and actors did a good job of giving me a feeling of connection to the 3 men vying for the 1st place finish.

Steve Martin is always amazing, Owen Wilson is great and Jack Black is particularly great in this movie!  Normally i'm not a big fan of Jack Black either, he tends to be over the top, but in this movie he's great as an everyman sort of guy who loves birding and strives to see as many species of birds in 1 year as he possibly can while working a full time job, battling parents that don't always understand and trying to juggle dating at the same time.  I don't know why this movie wasn't a big hit.  The writing is very clever, the setting and cinematography is beautiful, perfect cast, the whole movie is so well put together and is not to be missed.  Sometimes i just play this movie in the background when i'm doing chores around the house because the scenery by itself is so gorgeous.

4424549,5,B004LWZWBU,"An entertaining movie that really captures the excitement of a Big Year.  Non-birders may think this stuff is all make-believe, but birders know it happens.  And, in this case the movie gets most of its scenes right out of the non-fiction book.",1386201600,,244,4.785714285714286
4424550,4,B004LWZWBU,"Love the movie, don't like the extended version.  I love John Cleese, but having watched both the extended version and the ""regular"" edition of the movie, I prefer Jack Black's narration.  The biggest difference between the two is the voice over.  There are a few additional cut away scenes of birds, but nothing that has any bearing on the story itself.  If you are on the fence between the two my personal recommendation is the regular ed. but to each their own.

The movie itself centers around Black, Martin, and Owens who are all birders and their objective is to see as many birds as possible from January 1 to December 31 to attain the title of the worlds greatest birder.  Owens currently holds the title and is looking to ensure that it holds, or that if competition is serious enough that he beats his own record at any cost to maintain his title.  The story centers around the lives and adventures of these three as they jump back and forth across the country trying to add to their count.  Being the best requires sacrifice and dedication... sometimes winning may not be worth the cost.

While the subject matter (birding) is far outside what I consider to be the normal scope of movies that I seek out, the cast, the soundtrack, the story, and the beautiful visuals really do make this a movie that we watch regularly.  It's definitely kid safe which is nice to find.  It can be hard to find movies the entire family can not only tolerate but actually enjoy.  This is one of them!",1386115200,,1493,4.529850746268656

I talked my library into buying the book when it first came out and while I was surprised to see that it was adapted as a comedy (birding is SERIOUS!), I thought it did a good job except for having the Snowy Owl being an elusive life bird.

Most of the changes from reality were fun and worked well for the format. If you liked the movie or the premise, you probably like the book even better. One inexplicable change made in the movie was that everyone's totals were slightly inflated from reality. And of course it had the obligatory Hollywood ending.",1385683200,,432,4.623376623376624

I LOVED it.  And then I bought and read the book (which was based on a true story, saw the differences between the book and the film, and decided that I loved them both.  So of course, I had to buy the movie.

Having said that, I would like to clearly state that the character of Kenny Bostick in the movie, was supposed to be based on that of Sandy Komito, a real birder who was named in the book.  But in its traditional fashion, Hollywood so embellished the plot and the characters that they needed to change the names of the characters to avoid lawsuits!

I've met and birded with Sandy Komito.  He is indeed a purpose-driven man, a superb birder and highly competitive.  However, there the resemblance to the Kenny Bostick character ends.  Sandy is kind, helpful to other birders, courteous and very, very funny!",1385337600,,1013,4.521978021978022

My husband is a great lover of birds , though not a ""life lister"" and this was his suggestion.  He did notice a few inaccuracies in the scientific references made in the film but got over that.  It's an entertaining comedy with a good cast and a story line that basically works. The Big Year references a count of North American bird life with the purpose of having the most species counted by an individual.

I'm not going out on a limb to say the characters are fun and full-featured with just the right contrast in age, motivation and background to makes their interaction very interesting.  The settings are beautifully photographed and the whole subject is so informative and educational regarding the birds that populate, propagate and pollinate our avian country.  Fun, no foul, only fowl language; so even good for families.  Plus, fashion addicts will love the dapper dress of one main character in particular, matched only by the brilliant and subtle plumage of the birds themselves...high-flying entertainment!",1379030400,,653,5.565656565656566

It is a brief introduction to hundreds of birds and the beauty and delight they offer. Steve Martin, Jack Black, and Owen Wilson bring to the film very different characters, lives, relationships, and the inevitable change enduring the steady march of time and life; and the choreography of structuring passions, desires, and pursuit of joy and harmony.

I could only compare this movie to a peaceful camping trip deep in the woods with someone pretty, funny, and entertaining.

But it is not really a laugh a minute comedy, there are many funny moments, and I enjoyed seeing Owen Wilson in a role where he is not so likeable.  This movie has a nice message, and this is one of Jack Black's better movies (I am a jack Black fan, just not a fan of every movie he has done).",1374451200,,449,4.033707865168539

4424753,4,B004LWZWBU,"This is an ADORABLE COMEDY! This movie sneaks up on you. By that I mean that you don't realize how good it is because it quietly keeps you engrossed...without car chases and graphic murders! You can read detailed story summaries in every review, so I'll just give you the short version. Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson all compete in the world of ""Birding""....to see who can see the most varieties of birds in a given year. It is on a ""honor system!"" Who would even think that something like that could exist in today's society, but in this honorable hobby it does. These three comedians all tone down their sometimes slap-stick form of comedy and use subtlety to their advantage. You find yourself begin to be caught up in the competition of seeing the next seagull or barn owl. Rashida Jones brings her brand of cheery beauty into the picture when she captures Jack Black's heart in a tiny little town in Alaska where it is practically mandatory for ""birders"" to go at a certain time of year to see a wide variety of birds. She has a boyfriend when she meets him to add to the tension... This is a fun romp, and I am sure you will like it. I recommend this movie.",1373846400,,1174,4.414746543778802

 The birds that are discussed are authentic,  but some are unlikely to extremely rare.  In the 43 years my husband and I have been birding, our life list is 186 birds.  The ""Big Year"" for the characters are over 700 for one year.  That takes a lot of time and travel to manage, which is the point of how much of a competition it would actually be!

Acting was lame, plot line predictable, phonybaloney robot birds, sappy, not ONE funny line, I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters.

4424823,3,B004LWZWBU,"It's what's known as a comedy of manners. It's a form of entertainment which makes fun of the affectations, habits, values and manners of our times through characters familiar to us in our encounters with them like an old person pretending to be young, the career executive, or the playboy. The plot usually revolves around a scandal but in this case, The Big Year deals with a project that gets out of hand. The characters lose sight of the priorities in their lives, struggle to recover them or discover new ones. The plot is less important than the witty dialogue between them. At their best they can satirize the hypocrisy and pretension in society. Unlike the unbeaten Miami Dolphins who can do nothing but wait until every team has suffered a loss before they can toast that their record is safe for another year, Kenny Bostick can actually do something about it. He spent an entire year of his life setting a record number of sightings. Now sane folk know that records are meant to be broken but it means so much to Bostick's self esteem that he can't allow it to be broken by anybody but himself. It's really an exercise in vanity by all three characters except the other two still bear a sense of responsibility to the people around them. In the end one discovers his next wife while the other re-discovers his family when they learn that there are more important things in their life than a big year and birds. The acting is fine. Beautiful photography. The writing is weak and the script loses focus. One guy will throw his life away. It's the job of the other two characters to learn why he's so reckless. Learn why they would never do it themselves but can hardly lecture him themselves when their own behavior leaves much to be desired. It had potential. I liked it. But it lacks punch and misses too many points about our times. Where's the dialogue? There's an extended version with another 40 minutes. Was it cut away for a shorter fast-paced film? Simply not worth the time?? Don't know. It's a shame that this film was lost but cinema like the theatre demands good writing.",1369353600,6,2092,4.581333333333333

I'd hoped to see more of the birds, which were, after all, the pot of gold at the end of The Big Year Rainbow.

I liked the movie but was underwhelmed with the relative little footage of birds but much wasted time on human drama, especially the marriage crisis caused by the husband not showing up at the hospital at a critical moment.  That story line felt fake.

Anyway, I got the book after seeing the movie and the book is fantastic!  I think the best movie that could have been made of the book is probably a documentary.  Second best might be a drama.  Truth be told, this is not an easy book to adapt to the big screen.  Birds are main players and they don't act on cue.  The characters in the book are so inspiring I think a drama that highlights their ordeals and their determination would have proved a more moving experience than trying to amplify the personal rivalry among the three and poking fun at them through the process.",1363996800,,910,4.380952380952381

Two key differences: 1) The extended version looks at the competitive efforts among the three birders more objectively than the original release, and 2) the extended version offers a little more information about the ecology of Neotropical migratory birds and the perils of migration than the original release.  If you are already familiar with birding and North American migrating birds, then the extra information is just that: extra, not significantly added to the story.  If you are not familiar with birds or avian migration and want to enjoy a story along with some biology, the extended version is for you.  If you are not familiar with birds and want a more singular human-centered storyline rather than a semi-complete parallel avian plot, stick with the original release.",1361577600,2,953,5.28476821192053

4424934,5,B004LWZWBU,"Enjoyed Steve Martin and Jack Black showing a more serious side--- this is a lighthearted movie about the importance of relationships, setting priorities. Theme: follow your dreams and value the people in your lives. A guideline I use: a film is worth watching if I come to care about the characters. Given that criteria, this movie is a winner.

As a birder, I enjoyed the story line and the transformation in Martin and Black's characters  as the film progresses. John Cleese does a nice job narrating as we view the many fine wildlife and landscape scenes. If you're looking for a major comedy, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an evening's entertainment, this may be for you.",1360281600,,685,4.796610169491525

To be honest, we didn't expect it to be as enjoyable as it was. Anyone who follows real ""big years"" will appreciate the locations and truth behind the making of this film. Well done to everyone associated with its creation.",1360022400,,397,4.306666666666667
4424937,4,B004LWZWBU,"I skipped this movie when it was released in the theatres.  The whole premise of a comedy revolving around bird watching just sounded dull.  But I ended up renting The Big Year from Netflix and discovered it was fun and entertaining.

You can read the plot summary for yourself on Amazon. The movie really isn't about bird watching, but rather is about how each of the three main characters, Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin, manage a crossroad in their lives while competing in ""The Big Year"", birding's equivalent of the Super Bowl. Many high jinks unfold as do spectacular outdoor backdrops as the three crisscross the country in search of elusive sightings of birds like the Pink Footed Goose and the Snowy Owl.  Although a comedy, the movie has its tender moments as each character wrestles with how their obsessive ""hobby"" has caused hardship and loneliness for those closest to them.",1360022400,,898,4.849673202614379

It's a light-hearted comedy so don't look for any depth of character or any moral takeaways.  But, for good family-friendly and light entertainment - it's perfect.  This movie made me an even bigger fan of Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin.  Whenever I need to get my mind off of serious, unpleasant matters, I drop this DVD into my player and lay back for a couple of hours because it's mindless in a very good way.  It also inspired me to the art and science of birding.  I now have a much greater appreciation for the skill and knowledge it takes to be a great birder - for which America has a few -- whose books are worth discovering also, so check out your local book store.",1359504000,,850,4.3081761006289305

I got it for him for Christmas.  He was very happy when he unwrapped it.  Even though it has a cast known for comedy - and there are some light-hearted moments - it is not over-the-top.

The story is very well-written, with many small moments coming together to create cohesive, satisfying story arcs for the three leads.  The characters are fully developed, both from a writing and acting standpoint.  The scenery is just beautiful--you will feel like you have traveled all over with these characters.  The movie is full of big-name actors, and I wonder if they signed on so they could travel to these great locations.  The birds are fun, but not the important part of the story.  They are just the vehicle for a great story about three guys with a dream.  I am so glad this movie got made and that I stumbled across it.",1359331200,,807,4.666666666666667

This is a movie about the competition between three `birders', people who value sighting bird species over their own personal lives. The thing is, it's not. It's about how their passion of `birding' affects their personal lives...cementing them, and losing them.

4424955,5,B004LWZWBU,"My wife bought me this movie on BluRay for Christmas fearing I would get it for myself. We had already seen the DVD version that she checked out from the library. I have been a birder for 40 years and my wife joined me 24 years ago. This movie has an impressive amount of accurate information in it about birding. We have noticed a couple of flaws (There are no penguins in the Aleutians). We were both thrilled, though, to see such big-name actors playing birders. It is true that people who do a ""Big Year"" are rare individuals as few can afford to spend so much time (and money) during any one calendar year looking for the little feathered dinosaurs. Personally, I find the geographic boundaries quite arbitrary. Birds don't respect political borders. Anyone who beats the record for doing a Big Year certainly does not qualify as the ""best birder in the world"" as the region does not even cover the whole Nearctic region, much less the world. I have given up keeping a North American bird list long ago and have even let my ""world list"" go by the wayside (I am guessing it is somewhere around 2,000). But we have seen the movie four times and plan to watch it again with some birding friends of ours. This movie deserves ten stars!

I saw a video review by someone who represented the masses and gave this movie a poor grade. He said that the opportunity for comedy was squandered and that the talent was wasted on this film. I was offended as I believe that the dialogue and humor were very witty and amazingly suitable to the subject matter. The humor and sentiment you see in the movie are exactly the kind you expect to come from real birders. While few people will have the real life experiences represented in this film, it will give genuine insight into what really goes on in real birding experience, for that is the point of this movie; not to deliver the same kind of comedy that is in all of the mass-produced productions written with the same formula. This film should provide a refreshing and unfamiliar adventure for novices in the field of wildlife appreciation though from a competitive perspective. I think that the humor in this movie simply flew over the reviewer's head as did the birds.

By the way, my wife and I saw our ""lifer"" Colima Warblers probably hiking the same trail on a stressful hot sunny day at Big Bend. We ran out of water half way through our hike and my wife managed a partially colapsed lung during our ordeal. But it was worth it. She recovered and we will never forget that day.",1358208000,,2525,4.48695652173913

My gripe is although we selected the 'extended edition' through Amazon Instant Video, there was nothing (really, truly nothing) extra about it.  It was the movie.  Period.  That's fine if it is what you are expecting - not so much if you are looking forward to the additional features.

4425006,2,B004LWZWBU,"Even though this movie is placed in the comedy section, it's not really a comedy. I think they only put this in the comedy section because they have an all star cast of funny people! Otherwise, you get other actors and do the same movie and people would be asking why is this movie in the comedy section?

I really like this movie, but they need to really know how to put the movie in the right category. This movie is so much of a Adventure Drama that it wouldn't fit anywhere else. Why is this so? The actors travel in the movie to multiple places in the whole movie and they even show you how and what they use to travel. They talk about travel and where they have gone and everything is about their adventures. Heck, they even show how one of their birds travel to place to place. So, it's definitely an adventure movie.

Is this movie a drama movie? There a great deal of relationships problems, emotional problems, job suffering,  and everyone favorite life choices based decisions that makes you feel like hating each character in the movie. If that's not drama to you, you don't know what drama is!!!

Now the big question, is this a comedy? Heck no! What in the world did people thought was funny is the real question here? Any one that found this movie really funny tell me what part? Where was the humor?

Here's examples, of what people may think could be funny but wasn't really. When Steve Martin ran towards the plane and was about to fly away. Owen Wilson saw Martin running towards the plane, but didn't say anything about it and grin about it. What? Was that supposed to be funny? Made me kind of mad about it. Missing a flight that won't be able to take again until the next week. Oh I would hate if that happened to me. Oh that really made me feel like it was a drama than made me feel like laughing about it. Who really thought that was hilarious. Is one sick person!

Was it supposed to be funny when Owen Wilson hops a fence, while Martin was distracted by a old lady. Then, Wilson quickly takes a picture of the bird and then he hops over the fence again out? And, the fact that Martin never knew about Wilson action was supposed to make that funny? Really??? I saw it - I thought about it, and not even a chuckle came out of me. I like to add that the jungle music and narration playing in the background while Wilson was doing his action didn't make me laugh out loud. He didn't look funny doing it. He didn't fall over doing it. He didn't look great doing it. He just did it and it wasn't a funny thing to it.

Why in the world did those idiots put this movie in the comedy section? Really? Put it in the true category it deserves to be in! Do it now!!!",1351382400,,2680,4.232876712328767

4425011,5,B004LWZWBU,"As you will note, I have given this movie five stars.  I will add that these are an enthusiastic five stars.  The primary reason I have rated this film so high is that I personally have added it to my ""most favored"" list.  I have watched this thing about six times now and was as delighted during the last viewing as I was with the first.

Now I realize that not everyone is going to be as enthusiastic about this film as I am.  As a matter of fact, some folks will absolutely hate the thing.  That is okay though - hey there are thousands upon thousands of movies out there and no one can like them all and no one can hate them all.  First let me start though by telling you (as I see it) what this movie is not:

Even though the three male stars in this movie; Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin are three of the funniest men in the film industry, this movie is not what you would call hilarious.  The supporting cast which includes Time Blake Nelson, Dianne West, Brian Demehy, Angelica Huston, Rosamund Pike and Rashide Jones are a very talented group of actors yet there is not one hint in the movie of ""acting envy.""  Not once have I detected a hint of professional jealously or competition.  This is not a high action, high drama or intense movie by any stretch of the imagination.  There are no killings, no zombies, vampires or werewolves, no brooding teen stars, nothing gets blown up and there are no hot sexy sex scenes from the beginning to the end.

This movie was loosely based on the book with the same title written by Mark Obmascik, 2004.  This, by the way, is a wonderful book; one which I have read twice.  The original book was based upon a real life situation, i.e. tracking three men (the men portrayed in the film) while they were attempting a ""Big Year.""  For those of you that do not know what a big year is read the product description offered above.  The movie is partly true and partly fiction.

I suspect that those who are interested in birding or are birders themselves will appreciate this film more than those who are not consumed by this ""hobby.""  I will tell you that the movie very accurately portrays just what fanatical birders are and what they are capable of.  It catches the essence of the competition perfectly and addresses the ""problem"" with complete and absolute obsession.  I know of what I speak here as I am one of those unfortunately obsessed myself so I perfectly understood where these three men where coming from.

The acting in this movie was excellent as each actor played the part he or she was assigned perfectly.  Each actor made the part he or she was playing perfectly believable and this is as it should be because, yes folks, there are indeed many, many individuals out there in the birding world just like what is portrayed on the screen.

I found this to be a very mellow film and a wonderful break from what we are dished out these days.  The story had a quite, respectful and whimsical dignity about it that for me was captivating.  I was entertained and I could most certainly relate.  As a matter of fact, I think I am going to give this one another viewing this evening...the dogs and I.

Only to be pleasantly surprised by one the most underrated and equally delightful movies I've seen in years. The Big Year is about birding, and if you weren't a fan before you might be after viewing this movie. Fun to watch and it fulfills the basic purpose of a movie, to entertain you for a few hours and leave you with a good feeling. Watch it yourself and see what I mean. Truly a wonderful movie.",1348444800,3,496,4.231578947368421

Great performances by all of the cast members and an unlikely but successful combining of the talents of Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson.  All favorites of mine and in combo they're even better.  The story starts pretty low key but the action and tension builds - yeah, this is serious birding. LOL",1348444800,3,440,4.4875

I laughed and actually forgot my troubles! All the acting was so real...I have seen birders race on to the next after spying one and marking their list.  The makers of this movie were spot on getting the birders and their obsession with birds portrayed so accurately.  The plane ride to Attu and the helicopter chase were hilarious.  I enjoyed this movie so much, I bought it.  Thank you all for making such a fun movie about bird watching with such talent.",1348012800,4,635,4.330508474576271

4425028,5,B004LWZWBU,"Surprised but extremely happy.  Finally, a movie that shows birders as we really are.  Nerdy, competitive and driven by an obsession that is difficult to explain.  As a long time birder I read the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book/dp/0965901343/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book</a>&nbsp;that this movie is based on many years ago.  I remember thinking, this would make a really good movie, but no one would even think of making it.  I was shocked when I found out that not only was it being made but that the cast included Steve Martin (who kind of looks like many real birders that I know) and Jack Black (who doesn't).  I stood in line at the theater the day that it was released and have watched it many times since.  I doesn't surprise me that the movie received mixed reviews.

This is a comedy that provides very few big laughs, it's more whimsical than hilarious.  It is much more like real life than a Hollywood comedy and I am sure that this has disappointed more than one cinema-goer.  However, for birders this is a movie that we can really relate to.  Great remote locations; scores of bird names that only those that have studied their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peterson-s/dp/0618966145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peterson's</a>&nbsp;or their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sibley-s/dp/0679451226/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sibley's</a>&nbsp;would recognize; and a lot of beautiful shots of  gorgeous birds.

4425032,4,B004LWZWBU,"It was only a few weeks ago as I headed out the door to go birding that I passed a full-length mirror and realized I had become the stereotype you see so often in the background of this film: the extra who pops up with a camera from behind the cattails, the person who is entirely concealed by tall grass waiting for the flight of a rare warbler. If any hobbyist can be more clearly stereotyped than birders, they are unknown to me, and any film which can so clearly capture the essence of a stereotype without being offensive has got to be a winner. To the non-birder, I will say this: the movie is funny regardless. To the birder, I will add: be prepared to laugh at yourself at every turn. Now if you'll excuse me, I've heard that Empidonax traillii is making an appearance in my favorite nature area...",1345939200,,806,4.344370860927152

It discussed the relationship between wife and husband, the subject is bird watching in this movie, but it can be anything.

It discussed the relationship between parents and ""kids"". Parent's expectation of success is different from kids, most of the time. It discussed the realtionship between jobs and ""hobby"". In order to save other people's jobs he had to detour from his hobby and Stu became No. 4. But No. one loses his wife.

No. 2 is the lucky one. He reconciled with father and found a girl friend.

4425044,3,B004LWZWBU,"Jack Black, Steve Martin and Owen Wilson are in one movie, but despite the three names in the leading roles, ""The Big Year"" was hardly a commercial success, reaching 9th place in the U.S. box office charts in its first week. But is the film so bad? Directed by David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada""), the film has some nice moments, though it seems the director is not really sure what to do with the unique subject matter - the Big Year - as if being afraid of offending anyone.

Doing a Big Year is the ultimate dream for every birder - viewing (or hearing) as many different kinds of birds as possible in a specific area, like across North America. This means that three characters thirty-something computer programmer Brad Harris (Black), a big company's CEO Stu Preissler (Martin) and the current record holder Kenny Bostick (Wilson) will be chasing more than 700 bird species, from the Gulf Coast area to Attu Island.

This may be a great idea for film on paper (""The Big Year"" is based on Mark Obmascik's book of the same title), but to turn it into a good film you need a good story, which ""The Big Year"" does not have. Many talented players appear - Anjelica Huston, Rashida Jones, Tim Blake Nelson and Dianne Wiest, to name a few, but they are given little to do in the film. Only Brian Dennehy as Brad's father and Rosamund Pike as Kenny's wife are memorable.

But the biggest disappointment is the three leads, whose characters and stories remain bland at best. With these talent players, the filmmakers could have made a low-key drama, a romantic comedy, a farce or even a satire. Well-acted and beautifully-shot, ""The Big Year,"" either as a comedy or a drama, simply fails to find its own voice other than the interesting subject matter. The film is a pleasant experience, but there is a much better film buried in its premise.",1345680000,3,1842,4.592705167173253
4425045,2,B004LWZWBU,"I had not heard much about this movie prior to watching it, and the descriptions I did read didn't really pull me in. Despite my gut instinct, I decided to put it on my HBOGo watchlist anyway, and watch it I did.

I should have listened to my gut.

The concept of a big year is interesting in itself, but only as a curiousity. To anyone not a bird watcher, it is hard to find the excitement in the competition beyond the fact that it is a competition. I understand the reason that some would find it compelling; I just think it is compelling to a very tiny member of the populace.

Now, before we get up in arms, I know that the point of this movie is not about bird watching, or competition, or big years. The point that the movie makes is one of self-knowledge and discovery, of sacrifice and consequence. And I admit, to a degree, it accomplishes its mission.

It just didn't make me care. And that's where the movie failed me.

The attempts to show change and growth failed miserably, primarily because of their obvious predictability. From the second the last of the three main characters was introduced, you knew without a shadow of a doubt what was to happen to each of them. The only real question was who was going to have the Big Year.

As for the actors themselves, you can't fault them. They did the best they could with what they were given, but even the best actors can't save a meager film.

In the end, I was not entertained. I finished watching this movie only because I had nothing better to do at the time. At least I was able to read a few hundred tweets while I was at it. So, in summation, my one line review:

This movie was not bad enough to actually make me turn it off, but it came close.",1345161600,,1714,4.252307692307692

I rented this movie because of the main actors involved.  I've enjoyed each of them in various films and was intrigued with a story involving all three together.  I expected to laugh, which I did.  What I didn't expect but enjoyed immensely was how easy going and clean this was.  In a Hollywood culture where sex, violence, and crudeness reign sensationally, it was refreshing to see something that was more down-to-earth and realistic.  Like another reviewer, I have watched this more than once.  It's a bit of a feel-good antidote to stress for me.  I also learned some things; if you are not a ""birder"", you will too.

Finding over 700 species takes them across the country and into various environments to which they flock with the enthusiasm of a hawk on a mouse. Owen Wilson's character, Bostick, is the previous year's winner and he wants to defend his record while the others are out to overtake his birding prowess. Extensive time away from home and family takes a toll on the birders and has Bostick's wife crying fowl. Nothing over the top happens in this film, just birders on a mission, yet, The Big Year strikes me as an undeclared salute to Audubon and I enjoyed it.",1343865600,,716,4.6015625

Maybe it's just the clean-cut enjoyment of the plot, nothing violent and no gratuitous sex scenes.  It spoke of examining what our priorities are in life and how each one has to decide what that means to them.  Yes, it was simplistic treatment of a life-long pursuit, but watch the movie without any preconceived ideas and I think that you will enjoy it.",1343692800,,511,4.291666666666667
4425052,5,B004LWZWBU,"The Big Year takes a fairly mundane topic, birding (note to any birders, I'm not trying to insult your sport, just acknowledging it's not considering exciting by many) and makes it into a fantastically immersive movie. The movie really isn't about the birding, though there's plenty of beautiful birds throughout, it's about the relationship of three unconnected characters both to their loved ones and to each other, and how one small decision--to participate in a ""Big Year""--changes the way they look at themselves and how they interact with their loved ones. Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin all give compelling performances, and minor characters including Community's Joel McHale never fail to bring a smile.

The cinematography of this movie is also fantastic; given the premise there are plenty of options to pan across stunning vistas, but the film doesn't just hold itself to that. There are plenty of unusual and, dare I say it, avant garde camera techniques. Overall this was a surprisingly good film about a subject I wasn't overly familiar with or interested in; one of the better films I've seen in a while.",1342828800,,1129,5.037433155080214

The plot behind this movie is among the stupidist I have ever seen and shows just how desperate hollywood is for something to dump on the public. Jack Black and Steve Martin must be getting really desperate for work to be a part of this waste of film. The writers, director and producer should all be banned from film making for life so we don't end up wasting our time watching any more of their crap!

4425064,5,B004LWZWBU,Wonderful film about three men whose lives are interwoven by the passion they share for birding. Incredible scenery and an expertly written narrative on the lives of birds will captivate viewers. The final lesson of pursuing one's dreams at the cost of losing your loved ones is strongly punctuated by the choices each character must make in the film. Highly recommended.,1341705600,3,371,5.098360655737705
4425065,2,B004LWZWBU,"The Big Year is atrocious!  Luckily I can keep my thoughts short and sweet since nothing interesting happens so this won't take long.  The first 30 minutes is about Owen Wilson having marital troubles along with the reconstruction of his home.  The problem is that he's never home and is out bird watching instead, which results in constant arguments with his wife (she doesn't want him to go on his bird spotting adventure and given how boring and lifeless his character is, you can hardly blame her).  Jack Black likes to imitate the sounds of several birds and eventually wins the admiration of another bird caller (a female that he likes) on his particular bird spotting trip.  Steve Martin... well at first he cares about flat out boring business meetings, but eventually he tags along with Jack Black as they take to the snowy mountains of Alaska.

When the actual bird spotting gets underway about halfway through, it becomes clear that Owen Wilson and Jack Black are competing against each other to see who can take the most photos of birds.  A disastrous decision on the part of the movie writers was to try and implement emotion like snapping bird photos is the most important competition ever.  Viewers won't buy into that sort of thing so adding feeling and concern for Jack and Owen's character was a horrible mistake.  Owen should have listened to his wife and just stayed home.  What a lousy movie, really.  Lousy writing, no humor whatsoever, no enticing storyline, flat film overall.

That's right- no comedy at *all* despite being tagged as a comedy.  When you don't even laugh once you know something's wrong, SERIOUSLY wrong.

The only worthwhile moment comes at the very end during the credits when we see all 755 photos of the collected birds running in succession.  Everything from cardinals to robins to ducks to mocking birds to... you name it.  It's an amazing sight and clearly the only reason to watch this movie.  I could watch those 3 minutes over and over.  For the amazing display of photos during the credits the Big Year gets a 2-star rating.

The most disappointing part is that all those amazing bird varities were never even brought up during the duration of the movie.  What a shame.  Find a way to watch the credits and skip the rest.",1341619200,,2273,4.732824427480916

Don't get me wrong - I love birds, but bird watchers?  Anyway, I noticed that it had a pretty good cast of actors that I like. So, I decided to watch the trailer - thus the hook.
I like comedies, and I like to watch them with my girlfriend.  I convinced her to watch the trailer. She being a big animal lover, she was easy to convince.

I really enjoyed this film.

Some reviews have suggested this film is unrealistic. I disagree. It's completely conceivable. Travel is not always as expensive as one thinks. Priority is key, but who cares, anyway? The characters were normal, moderate, like human beings. They didn't fly from one end of the emotional spectrum to the next. They weren't caricatures. This movie was sweet. It was hopeful. It was genuine. The portrayals of everyone were kind.

I'm so glad I ignored the bad reviews here and gave it a whirl. I'm not a birder, but I think the story is bigger than that. It's about aiming for something. It's about balance. It's about love and really living.

Jack Black is usually full of dark and angry energy, but in this film he was likeable, and Owen Wilson does an amazing job of maintaining his likeable goofy demeanour  while portraying an obsessive who is not at all likeable.

4425106,2,B004LWZWBU,"When you think about combing the acting and comedic talents of Steve Martin, Jack Black, Owen Wilson, Angelic Houston and a few others, you would probably expect the outcome of that movie would result in pure gold. So how is that when combining all these stars, it fails to be memorable comedy?

A big year is explained as being someone who dedicates a whole year of their life hunting, chasing, and photographing birds. The past winner was played by Owen Wilson who saw 728 birds, which is the current record. Steve Martin plays a businessman who is about to retire and wants to have a big year, and Jack Black is someone who hates his job and his passion is achieving a new record. Jack and Steve meet along the way on their Big Year, and Owen Wilson's character is defending his title and trying to stop them from breaking his record. Along the way they discover love, and what really matters more then bird watching.

Sound interesting to you? Then watch it. Sound dull? Then don't bother, you aren't missing much. The plot is as boring to explain as what most of this movie was to watch. There is very little comedy. Now and then Steve Martin will make you chuckle, but not enough for me to even say this is a light-hearted comedy. It's more a light-hearted drama with a few tiny humorous spots thrown in here and there.

I don't get this movie tho, it was meant to be a comedy, but had none, it's based on a true story, supposedly, but left me thinking, why would anyone bother to do this? And the acting talent I really expected something better from. Either a funnier movie, or something better in the acting department that says ""OK, you did this to showcase your talents"" but no, that's not it either.

I find it puzzling how this all came together in the first place, and why? Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, I dunno, but I can't wrap my head around why it was even made?",1334534400,2,1885,4.392550143266476

If you like these actors and if you have ever admired the beauty and wonder of birds, then you will get this movie. It's light-hearted and thoughtful at the same time, about competition and relationships, and also birds! By the end,  you might think, on the one hand, that the real winners are the ones with good relationships and the loser is the one who is alone with first place. However, another angle is that passion rules, passion for what you love, for whatever reason, that drives you, and that's okay, too.

4425109,4,B004LWZWBU,"I was expecting this to be yet another cheesy male bonding/semi-romcom flick, but it was the best looking new rental on the shelf, and I like Black, don't mind Wilson and still give Steve a lifetime hall pass for Let's Get Small and his first half dozen movies. To my great surprise, Big Year has not only a large handful of funny moments, but also some truly intelligent, touching moments.

The fine script is what makes this one run, and the direction is playful enough to bring it to life. The takes on marriage and relationships are a little less predictable than usual, and sometimes even insightful. The ending is not the standard happy bs, and all in all Big Year succeeds as both a pleasant comedy, a decent almost-chick-flick, and a very nice introduction to birding. It won't do for birders what Best In Show did for dog folks...but that's probably a generous gesture!

I do love its love for birds and nature in general, and that spirit makes this film shine more than any of the performances (Black wins; his timing is equal to Martin's and their friendship is a highlight). The refusal of the movie to really laugh at birders, but rather show their love as based in a wonderful sense of awe at the wonders of our planet, is also a welcome treat. And I'm no birder! But I sure do admire their admiration of birds. Imagine life without birds...ouch.

The one real negative here is the exceptionally grainy and pixelated dvd. This is a TERRIBLE transfer. And you know what? I think this is a big scam the studios are starting to pull: they want to sell the blu-rays at a higher price so they make these look crappy by comparison. I've seen many many more bad recent dvd transfers in 2011-2012 than in any of the previous few years. I often think I'm imagining it...then I see a great recent dvd transfer and remember how perfect they CAN look, if the studio wants them to. And time and again the best dvd transfers are the ones without a blu-ray edition! You do the math. Hint: it's a plus for the studios and a minus for the consumers.

So: fine film, but avoid the dvd, and you know what? Don't even buy the BD, the studio doesn't deserve your money. Rent the BD at your local barn for a buck or two and there you go.",1333929600,7,2229,4.416058394160584

4425129,5,B004LWZWBU,"It's always a pleasure to find a movie that you thought would be terrible and being proven wrong. After the disaster that was GULLIVER'S TRAVELS I was certain that THE BIG YEAR starring Jack Black would be another travesty of film with him mugging for the camera the same way he always does. Instead I found a delightful film that I know I could watch again and enjoy.

Black stars as Brad Harris, a birder (bird viewing enthusiast) with an uncanny ability to know a bird by the song it sings. The main even for bird viewers is known as a Big Year, a year long event where they try to see as many species of birds as they can. When this 36 year old gets news his ex-wife is remarrying he decides this is the year to take time off from work to fulfill his lifelong wish to do a Big Year.

Stu Preissler (Steve Martin) has decided to retire for the second time from the multinational corporation he is CEO of. While the executives in charge want him to stay on, he too has decided that this is the best opportunity he will have to do his own Big Year. With his wife's blessings, he heads out to start watching.

Which leaves our third main character Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson). Kenny holds the record for the highest number of birds seen, over 800. His is the record to beat and one that he holds dear. So much so that he puts his record above everything else in his life including his wife (Rosamund Pike) and her desire to have children.

When word gets out the to bird crowd about a major even bringing thousands of species to one location, they all head to begin their counts. Bumping into one another on a boat, Brad and Stu strike up a friendship based on their love of birds neither one admitting to doing a Big Year. As the sightings escalate and they run into one another more often, they get closer and finally Brad admits what he is doing. But Stu holds back.

But Kenny recognizes what's happening and tries to play the two friends off of one another slowing them down in their quest at the same time. This enables him to continue on and attempt to set a new world record. But fences are mended and the friends continue to try and beat the already established record.

Along the way Brad faces two more challenges. One is his father (Brian Dennehy) a blue collar man who can't understand his son's quest. He considers him to be a failure rather than a man who has a chance to take the crown from Kenny. Brad also finds himself falling in love with another birder, a young woman who can make bird calls better than anyone he meets. Unfortunately he discovers she has a boyfriend. Along with the birding itself, these two stumbling blocks offer plot devices that fit nicely into the whole story going on.

Each of these three men comes from various financial backgrounds and families, each has their strengths and weaknesses and each has a goal in mind when it comes to their Big Year. But as the story unfolds we not only have the chance to witness some breath taking scenery but to get a fully flushed out story involving all three characters.

My biggest fear as I began this film was the actors. Black, Martin and Wilson have all had films in the past where a director's complete lack of control resulted in an actor taking over and ruining the production, trying to use their usual shtick thinking it was funny when in truth it had become boring. None of that exists here. Both Black and Martin give exceptional performances and flush out their characters to the fullest without resorting to the old standby laugh getters. Instead we have characters that we care about and who we hope will remain friends. Wilson's character is the saddest of the three without his own being aware of it. One hopes he will one day find the joy the other two achieve by the end of the film.

Don't let the simple concept of this film fool you. It offers so much more than one would think a movie about watching birds could. It also offers Black a chance at redemption in my book, giving him the chance to actually act rather than play the buffoon. Let's just hope he continues to do so.",1332201600,6,4082,4.396026490066225
4425130,5,B004LWZWBU,"A friend of mine rented this movie, and, as soon as the credits were done rolling, I purchased my own copy. It is simply a delight! One of the best movies I've seen this year. If you enjoy movies about personal growth and/or that have any of the following: birding, nature, traveling, laughter, competitions, or if you just want to be entertained then give this a chance. I won't go more into detail here about it as plenty of other reviewers have done that already, just watch it!

I do want to highly recommend the bluray 2-disc set as it includes the extended version narrated slightly differently by John Cleese (on the bluray disc in the extras section), which is as enjoyable if not moreso than the theatrical version narrated by Jack Black. The extended version also has a gag reel and some other fun behind-the-scenes extras about the locations to which the production crew and cast traveled, and there is one more very small character's story woven in to the extended version of the movie...that of a ruby-throated hummingbird. The ruby's story is laced throughout the movie, and I think it adds a little extra bit of birding fun and fullness to the overall feel of the film. It's just really sweet.

Overall, see this movie, theatrical or extended version - both are great!",1332028800,34,1283,4.697777777777778
4425131,5,B004LWZWBU,"Not sure why this didn't do all that well at the Box Office.  This is a great movie.  This is not just a movie about birding.  The movie is really about the lives of three people who want something so badly they will do almost anything to get it, and more importantly, the ramifications of sacrificing everything to get it.  It would be more accurate to characterize this as a movie about ""Life Choices"", written against the backdrop of birding.

The cinematography is excellent and the acting superb.  Although the three lead actors are well known to everyone, they did an outstanding job making me feel a real connection with the characters they played.  I think many people passed on this movie thinking it was just about birding, a subject that they may not be particularly interested in.  But the screenplay does an excellent job of blending someone's passion for birding with a very charming and heart-felt story about human relationships and the life-work balance.  Give this movie a chance.  Hopefully, it will do much better on DVD as word gets around that this is a movie that should not be missed.",1331942400,,1108,4.723958333333333

4425148,5,B004LWZWBU,"Yes, your read that right.  If Birding was Crack, my husband would be in jail, or more hopefully recovery.  But I doubt that recovery is possible.

We saw this in the theater with about 25 members of a local birding organization.  I think five audience members were non-birders and they were fortunate to see it with the perfect audience.  (Akin to seeing a Star Trek movie with Trekkers)

As you can imagine the audience thought the movie was great, and truthfully, unless you are a birder or associated with one, this film is great in ways you can't imagine.  That's how spot on this portrayal of the ""sport"" of birding is.  I am amazed at the level of accuracy in even the subtlest details.  At one point the boys cross paths looking for a rare humming bird, when they finally show the bird, it is in fact the real one the boys are supposedly looking for, not some glamorous dolled up Hollywood version of it's drab little self.

Although it is certainly not necessary, the more you know about birding and birders the more deeply you will enjoy this film.  It is that thoughtfully made.  The portrayals of the spouses also cover the gamut of situations a significant other might reasonably expect, the trials of trying to find that one elusive bird for your list, the difficulty of financing your obsession and of course, having to deal with people who just don't get it.

And yes, should word get out that you have a rare bird in your yard, folks will show up from miles away to see it.  We have been out to see a local rareity and have met people who drove from 500 miles away to see the same bird.  (See crack comment above.)

The acting is superb, you can expect the best of Steve Martin, the usual understated charm of a Jack Black performance and Owen Wilson plays a shockingly good rich jerk.

I think the filmmakers did justice to the joys a difficulties of this kind of quest (do you love your wife or birds?) for birders and for those who love them.  I agree with others who think this would be a great family film.  It's about something that is real.  The characters are not striving for money or popularity or to save the world.  Its about setting a goal others might think is a bit weird and then going all out to attain it for no other reward than having done it.  What's the harm in that?  None that I can see --unless watch the film and be come birders!!!!  Ahhhhhh.

The film is set around a competition to spot as many birds as possible within the US in a single year but acts as a metaphor for the personal problems in each of their years.

Martin is a big-shot lawyer whose entire firm can't survive a couple of days without him. Wilson keeps ditching his wife whenever a short-tailed sparrow bat is mentioned. Black can't get his life together, losing a career and a wife to bird watching, which appears to be pretty expensive. Naturally, all three discover how to fix these problems while peering through binoculars at our CGI feathered friends.

The Big Year isn't a comedy, nor a romance or drama. It's difficult to connect with the characters and understand their need to win the competition in the face of their own problems. It plods between talking heads scenes as characters criss-cross the country to identity birds. The three main characters were comically neutered and by the time the film was over, it was difficult to recount what had even happened. Overall, it's a missed opportunity given the talent involved.

Nothing huge happens.  No continents fall into the ocean.  No aliens land.  No international crime lords captured.  Just a charming film about three men, each of whom hopes to be the one to spot the most bird species during a one-year period.

There are subplots, but they aren't really so important.  Each man has a ""real life"" that intrudes a bit.  One has a father who disapproves and a job that must be attended to periodically.  One has a wife who wants to get pregnant, and the husband just isn't around much.  And one is trying to retire from a company that just can't seem to adjust to his being gone.

All that said, what the movie is really about is the passion, the absolute love, for birds that birders display.  Really, it is an obsession.

I am married to a birder, and, yes, we might get a phone call on vacation that a special bird was spotted only 500 miles from where we are (and 10000 ft in altitude difference) and why don't we dash over and see it.....  It can be trying for the non-birder (me).  But how wonderful that a group of people can have an obsession, a real love, for something so simple, lovely, and harmless.

The characters are very likable, there is humor, heart-warming moments, adventure, with some great scenery, and it's a good clean story you can enjoy with anyone.

""The Big Year"" is a contest started in 1900 among fanatical bird-watchers to see who can spot the most varieties of birds in a year in North America.  Owen Wilson is a former ""Big Year"" winner and current record holder.  Steve Martin and Jack Black have been dreaming of the adventure and excitement of this competition for some time and have decided this is their year to go after the win, and to break Owens record.

To be a true competitor in this you not only have to seriously know your stuff about the birds to be able to identify them by sight and/or by sound, it also requires you to chase all over North America  (lots of travel time, lots of expense and little luxury).  Flying, driving, boats, helicopters, bicycling, canoeing, hiking, bad weather, mosquitoes, etc. are all part of the chase for collecting those precious bird sightings.

Owen is rich and lets nothing get in the way of his quest, and is somewhat crafty/devious in hindering others who might be competition for his record.  Steve is also wealthy and is supposed to be retired, but his corporation is constantly after his time and pulling him away from the quest, and Jack is not wealthy and is trying to compete while also working full time and dealing with a father who doesn't understand him and is very disapproving of Jack.

Steve and Jack become friends and later ""team up"" (supporting each other's efforts - as it is a competition among individuals not teams) because as much as they each desperately want the win for themselves, it's most important that Owen lose.  It's a close competition and there is plenty going on in their personal lives too.  It's a very enjoyable movie.",1329868800,2,1957,4.690058479532164

I don't hate the concept, and the cast was likeable, but it did miss the mark for me. I had high hopes since the rest of the reviews on here were high, but it is not a 4 or 5 star movie. It's a 3 star movie, one that you probably won't love but won't hate spending a couple hours of your time on. Don't go into this looking for a ton of laughs, there are actually some pretty  dramatic moments (like when Bostick keeps leaving his wife).

After the movie we looked up the information they gave in the movie, and it appears that the basic facts are true, such as there being a ""Big Year"" birdwatching contest, and the birds on the Attu Island (which I'd never heard of).  Although we enjoy nature, we are by no means bird-watching enthusiasts, but we got a kick out of seeing people take ""enjoyment of birds"" to a whole new level.

They so misrepresented the movie, that they destroyed it in the marketplace. The film itself was beyond delightful. I really connected with the characters on a human level and felt the story was warm and enjoyable. The cinematography was fantastic and I found myself wishing more people would get an opportunity to experience this film as it truly is. I so enjoyed the film, that afterwards I called many of my friends and recommended the movie as I simultaneously corrected the misleading previews. I mean the film is great, it is as if the marketing team was embarrassed by the story and decided to ""candy-coat"" the movie. A real shame because the acting, writing, and filming stand on their own as a fantastic, all around feel good flick!

Bostick (Owen Wilson) is in serious competition. The movie is correct in that birders are on an honor system, although there are doubters which is why birders quickly become decent amateur photographers. Just about every year is a ""Big Year"" for birders as they always keep track of what birds they have seen as well as when and where. Most don't have the time or resources to cross the country several times a year, so they compete within their state.

The film shows some aspects of birders such as how life interferes with birding. Or how a birder would rather be in Brownsville, Texas at a dump site than in Paris, France. I have discovered that Birders are also acutely aware of things such as global warming as southern birds move north into new areas. They also know the points of illegal crossings as they visit the southern border at odd hours.

The movie has 3 diverse quirky characters competing nation wide to be the best birder. Jack Black and Steve Martin are likeable characters while Owen Wilson is the ""bad guy."" I had several laugh out loud moments during this feature. Birding is best done as a couples hobby.

The Big Year probably isn't going to win any awards or make millions at the box office (note: it didn't), but it's the kind of well crafted and scripted filmmaking we used to enjoy back in the 1960s or 70s before things got complicated with lame gags and explosions.  The cast is in great form.  If anyone could make an entertaining film about birding, it would be director David Frankel - and he succeeds.  Recommended.",1328313600,,596,4.481481481481482

What I find entertaining about this little gem of a movie is that every last problem the characters have, can be solved with copious amounts of money, and driving.
Rubbish like this portrays a way of life that does not really exist, thankfully the characters in this movie were either wealthy New York ad executives, or had their Daddy cover the costs of their fun when they are 36 years old.

At various crossroads in their lives, Stu, Brad, and Kenny embark on a cross-country trip in hopes of spotting the most bird species in North America; along the way, they each discover enough about themselves to move on.

Here's the deal; if you are looking for a zany Jack Black, slapstick Steve Martin, comically smug Owen Wilson type all rolled up into a big ball of gut-busting, knee slapping laughs then this movie is not for you.  Truth is, this movie is a great film, so long as you know what to expect (a task that the film's marketing team obviously dropped the ball on; dropped it and then stabbed it repeatedly with a sharp object until it's deflated rubbery carcass lay abandoned in the tall uncut grass). The Big Year is a charming story of three men determined to win a competition that consists of spotting as many rare birds in North America within a year. Owne Wilson plays the record-holding champion hell-bent on protecting his title from two newcomers played by Martin and Black. In all honesty, the movie will make you chuckle and... get ready for this; smile. It will literally make you smile as you are drawn into the lives of these characters with a refreshing sense of realism. And another bonus; the makes a great family night movie simply because it is not your typical profanity-laced, awkward situation movie that we have come to expect from Hollywood. Outside of, maybe 2 or 3, curse words that can normally be heard on network television, you can watch this with the kiddies. If you would like a feel-good story that will even make you reflect on aspects of your own life, then you won't be disappointed with The Big Year.

4425224,3,B004LWZWBU,"There has been a lot of buzz in the birding world when this movie was coming out. Almost every bird watcher that I know was anticipating its arrival. Our local Audubon chapter even brought out the author of the book to do a book signing and answer questions about this story. But was the hype really all it set out to be?

There are a few things this movie does a good job at - It entices people to go out and watch birds and shows just how challenging it can be and somewhat how fun. It does a good job at showing the different types of bird watchers (Laxed like Jack Black vs the very serious Owen Wilson), and it does an OK job at show casing the wide range of biodiversity (By geographic range only). But here's where it starts to get poor. The movie does not represent the book very well at all, it implicates a rather odd view of the pelagic trip leader, a person whom I've communicated with in real life Debrah Shearwater, it doesn't actually focus on the birds as much as the birding, it shows the extremes of bird watching and doesn't focus on the joys, and this movie can give birders a bad name (Now in state bird watching lists, we nickname certain birders Kamito based on their birding stratagies).

The book was very good and detailed, it covered the species being seen and chased ver well. The movie left a lot of the guts of this out. It added stuff that doesn't exist, and pretty much turned it into a hollywood movie, and not a true story like it truly is. While this is true for most books vs movies, I feel this hurt what could've been a better story in the long run, versus what it ended up being in reality. The casting was done very well, and Owen Wilson, Jack Black, and Steve Martin represent these three stereotypes based on their original characters, very well. So for that the movie is strong, but from the standpoint of a bird watcher with a dedicated life list for the US by ABA standards (Currently 445 species not a great accomplishment, but not bad after 3 years), and a world list by their own standards (687 currently), I was upset with the lack of details found by this movie.

If you go into it expecting to see a detailed report on Sandy Kamito's Big Year, you'll be slightly dissappointed. If you're doing this to see what kind of lives bird chasers live, you'll probably be more misled than educated. However, if you go into this with the mindset that I'm watching a movie that was written for  Hollywood and not for the story that sparked the book which led to the movie, you'll probably be happy with your purchase / rental and enjoy it. But please, don't take the movie to be a very serious representation for what really happened, and how birders really are. A Big Year is a very VERY tiny group of birders in the world. Not many people attempt it because it literally does take every ounce of your time and force you to spend a year traveling. This can be one of the most rewarding experiences in your life (Like for Jack Blacks character), or it can be the downfall of your existing life (Like Sandy Kamito - watch the movie to understand - no spoilers here).

I highly reccommend that if you read this, and what to know more about a real life Big Year experience, and the dedication, time, and money it takes to make this happen, hop over to google and search ""John Vanderpoel Big Year 2011"". John completed a big year this past December 31st missing the big year record by I believe 5 species (It's up in the air thanks to ambiguity in the ABA Guidelines for record acceptance - ask in the comments and I'll gladly explain). He of course won this last years record, and thanks to the remarkable migration flaws that occured, his number will more than likely be untouchable for the years to come, just as Kamitos still proves to be today.

In closure - this movie is just a glimpse at the 3 lives of 3 birders who have the same goal of copmeting in a big year. The movie will make you miss the days of traveling to Attu Alaska (no longer accessible to the public), provoke thoughts of traveling, but unfortunately it will do nothing to encourage the conservation of species, the protection of the birds habitats, or the pursuit for a species rights to continued existence. Maybe I expected too much, but as a birder, biologist, and wildlife conservationist, I was upset with the potential this movie had to make a difference.",1327795200,7,4372,4.40470297029703

In the middle of trying to become the next world champion all three face decisions that are much bigger then the birds. I have said many times that I think about 80% of the way you feel about a movie is based off of expectations about it going in. This is one that I was not looking forward to. A movie about bird watching with Jack Black (I have never been a big fan of his) did not sound appealing to me. Halfway through this movie (and Jack Black) won me over and I really enjoyed this. This movie was about so much more then bird watching. Dealing with some very heavy issues and as much of a drama as a comedy this is a movie very much worth watching. I recommend this.

4425226,5,B004LWZWBU,"I wrote a review on the book ""The Big Year"" by Mark Obmasick back on March 26,2004 and gave it 5 *'s. Little did I think at that time that the book would be turned into a movie. I went to the movie the first night it played at my local theatre ,here in Mississauga,Ontario.(Suburb of Toronto).I have been a serious Birder for over 20 years and have a Life List Of 602 for North America and 407 for Ontario,so it's pretty easy to relate to what this book and movie is all about. Although I do not have the fanatical inclination,resources or a marriage that would allow me to entertain the idea of a Big Year for North America. Roger Tory Peterson and James Fisher did one in 1953. They were on the road for 100 days,covered 30,000 miles and saw 600 bird species. They wrote about their experiences in a book  ""Wild America"" published in 1955. It remains a Birding Classic. The biggest Year List I embarked on was when I got 301 in a year in Ontario. Jan 1-Dec 31).
 I enjoyed the movie very much. It followed the book fairly closely. However,there are several places where it is exaggerated,but this is understandable,being a movie to be enjoyed by people who are not Birders. The 3 main characters in the movie are fairly close to the ones in the book,but the names have been changed. I am sure people who are not even Birders at all will enjoy it. I looked around and could not identify any Birders in the audience,but it got a lot of laughs. Let's face it,the movie had to have a lot of comic aspects if it hoped to get wide appeal. After all,that is what is expected from Steve Martin.
 The movie might be somewhat disappointing to someone who hoped to learn much about birds or birding. However ,birders will see a lot in the film that will remind them of themselves,experiences they have had,and many places they have visited,though over many years.

Besides, the birds are gorgeous, and the three stars are all great comedians. They chose to do these roles for a reason!

Tip -- if you don't want to buy it, rent it. But do see the closing credits for one of the most beautiful sequences in movies.",1325808000,5,575,4.466666666666667
4425230,4,B004LWZWBU,"""The Big Year"" is a pleasant movie, but one that absolutely found no audience at all at the box office.  Let's face it: a movie about competitive bird-watching?  Tough. Sell.  With Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin, it had a chance on paper.  But the marketing seemed tepid (I saw one commercial) and the film's generic name - through relevant in the story itself - meant nothing to people scanning movie listings.  I remember staring at the paper: ""Big Year, Big Year...what was that about?""  Our prime time audience featured the three of us...and four other people.

As a result, Fox got a $7m gross for its $40m investment...the very definition of a bomb.  Which is a shame, because it's a fairly good movie.  It's not Oscar category fare, nor is pretending to be.  But, it's enjoyable.  Owen Wilson continues to mature as an actor.  His 'Kenny Bostick' is supposed to be unlikable...until we find out - to the surprise of Steve Martin's Stu - that Bostick is a man of honor and, ultimately, likable.  It's the kind of thing that Owen Wilson can pull off.  He has that charm.

The loser here is Steve Martin.  That's unfortunate.  I've been a fan for 30+ years (big club), but when you're the big draw in a bomb like this, your&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-of-the-Bride-1-2/dp/B00386EZKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father of the Bride 1 & 2</a>&nbsp;days are long since past.",1325721600,3,1438,5.103004291845494

4425232,5,B004LWZWBU,"First of all, I enjoyed the other two reviews, they've got it right on. My wife and I saw this on the big screen and loved it. The matinee we attended only had about 2 other couples in it, which was terribly disappointing. We enjoyed this film and the DVD is already purchased, awaiting arrival on release.

It is refreshing to go to a movie and not have your ears assaulted by too loud music or special effects. This film doesn't need either, it's a good story on it's own. I think anyone that gives it a viewing will say it was worth it.",1324944000,57,539,4.1826923076923075
4425233,5,B004LWZWBU,"You'd think a movie, based on something as low key as birdwatching, would be a tough sell to Hollywood. Folks tramping around remote areas, waiting, watching, sipping from thermoses to catch a glimpse of a single bird, yeah, not real up there on the excitement meter. This film delivers a whole lot of laid back moments and not a single high speed chase. Well... maybe I need to rephrase that, there are no hostage situations or shoot outs.

Scenery and quirky characters abound. Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson are perfectly cast and the acting is spot on. The interaction between characters is stellar and there is a bitter sweetness as each man comes to grip with the uniquely similar obsession to catch sight of elusive birds. Drama, depth of character, quirky editing, this story about men's secret passions and the lengths they will travel to plant a flag on a mountaintop, or a feather on a cap, is entertaining and inspiring. I loved this quirky, charming and character rich film.",1324771200,16,997,4.796511627906977
