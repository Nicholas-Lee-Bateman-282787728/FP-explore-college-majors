1662212,1,B00005TPC8,Typical 70's lots of topless women but not much else. Hardly worth the time of letting it load. Granted I could only take it for the first fifteen minutes!,1368144000,,155,4.379310344827586
1662213,1,B00005TPC8,Worst acting I've seen. Appears that everyone was an amateur. No plot to it. Appears movie was designed to keep a male audience by showing a lot of boobs and skin.,1365984000,,163,4.290322580645161
1662214,3,B00005TPC8,"Directed by Gerry de Leon, Women In Cages (1971) is the second of three Roger Corman produced prison films, shot in the Philippines in the early 70's.  It's a mean trip into a dirty world of drugs, prostitution, sadism, murder, and corruption, where life is very cheap, and an innocent woman finds herself in prison with few options for survival.

A leader of a criminal gang named Rudy Acosta (Bernard Bonnin), runs a ship where gambling, and prostitution take place.  Acosta's girlfriend Carol ""Jeff"" Jefferies (Jennifer Gan) gets stuck holding a shipment of drugs, and finds herself in a prison located far out in the country.  Things don't look good for the new fish, as the sadistic head prison guard Alabama (Pam Grier), takes an immediate dislike to her.  And Stoke (Roberta Collins), a drug addicted inmate is instructed by Acosta's agent, to try and eliminate Jeff.

Escape is a deadly proposition, as a gang of bounty hunters are employed to track down escapees, and always bring them back dead.  Despite the dangers, Jeff, Stoke, and their cellmates Sandy Granger (Judy Brown) and Theresa (Sofia Moran), make a break with Alabama as a hostage.  The fugitives soon experience the ruthlessness of the bounty hunters.  Armed with a gun, Stokes leads the women to a rendezvous that may result in freedom, or death.

Women In Cages has a more colorful backstory than your typical women in prison film, with more characters involved, and a wide variety of locations.  Unlike Corman's previous film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Doll-House/dp/6305325820/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Doll House</a>&nbsp;(1971), the tone is much darker, and without humor.  A lot happens, and the film seems longer than its 80 minute runtime.  The last act is quite strong, with wild action and a cynical finish.  The acting is passable, with Roberta Collins, Judy Brown, Sofia Moran, and Pam Grier, providing the strongest performances.

For fans of exploitation, Corman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Women-in-Cages-Collection/dp/B004ZKKL0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Women in Cages Collection</a>&nbsp;which includes, The Big Doll House, Women In Cages, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Bird-Cage/dp/B00005TPC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Bird Cage</a>&nbsp;(1972), may be an economical way to acquire these films.",1349568000,3,2478,6.142028985507246
1662215,5,B00005TPC8,"Women In Cages is a movie perfect for An AntiFeminist like me,Because despite some belief it may be about ""empowerment""and the ""issues"" then coming up around this time,it is not. It's a GuyFlick,Guys know it we don't care about anything but the content.
The movie though is not your typical womeninPrison genre film,it is slow paced almost to the point of dull and sadly sick and sadistic. The Film maker was/is a sick pup,1 star for the film,5 stars for Pam Grier who isn't as beautiful in this movie as she in Coffy. This movie is mildly entertaining except for the sick parts and the Offensive Catholic/cross Imagery. In the end though everyone gets what had coming to them-Almost-but not quite sadly for 1 girl her fate is worst. There is some ""forgiveness"" thrown in there only to be eaten up by a bunch of Wild Men-the same Men-involved with said evil.(I won't give it away.)Pam Grier as Alabama is the main thing,The rest forget it. Although I prefer this movie to the ""Big Bird Cage"".",1329782400,,992,4.642045454545454

1662218,5,B00005TPC8,"Get out your riding crop and hot candle wax! Pam Grier is ready to take you to her version of hell (Harlem baby, I came from Harlem). Watch Pammy whip, beat, torture, and [hurt] inmates all the while wishing it was you taking Pam's abuse. What be up wit dat? Sucka if you don't know the sweet, tempting hot babe, then you be lost! Pam is queen of the 70's flicks. Not only that, but she looks better now than every female 70's star. She is a fine wine that improves with age...
If you dig movies with nudity, senseless dialog, bad language, sadism, and violence, then this is the flick for you. Pam runs this whole show. And like I said, if you don't know Pam, you don't know nothing you jive turkey!!!!!",1028505600,26,704,4.2611940298507465

1662254,4,B00005TPC8,"In the dark underworld of Filipino crime, women are playthings, discarded when broken. They wind up in prison. Not just any prison, but HER prison. Pam Grier (COFFY, FOXY BROWN) is THE MATRON aka: Alabama. Don't tick her off! She doesn't put up w/ disobedience. You'll end up in her ""play pen"". There, you'll be strapped into ""the boots"", and get cooked over a flame! Or, she'll give you a spin on her ""wheel-of-death""! THE MATRON is vicious! She's sadistic! And, she's single! Ahem, where was I? Poor Carol ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Jennifer Gan). She's been framed by her drug-lord boyfriend. Now, she's just another inmate in Alabama's chamber of horrors! Still, as w/ most women-in-prison epics, it's good to see that hair-care is always the top priority! Even while being tortured, their hair remains silky and manageable! WOMEN IN CAGES is one of the best of these films ever made. Check it out...",1374537600,,894,4.849673202614379

1662257,4,B00005TPC8,"""Women in Cages"" is the ludicrous story of an American blonde woman (I assume she was a lone tourist looking for a good time) sent to a Mexican prison called Carcel del Infierno after her Mexican drug lord boyfriend stashes heroin in her purse to avoid his own arrest. Her first line in the movie is ""Do you know, I still don't know what you do?"". She tells this to her Mexican boyfriend at a cockfight. His answer: ""You might say I'm a player"". I'm serious!! And this is the beginning of a fun woman prison movie. Of course the prison guards are corrupt and lead by lesbian badass Pam Grier. When a tortured prisoner cries, ""What kind of hell did you crawl out of?"", Pam Grier snaps back, ""It was called Harlem, baby!"". There is even a torture chamber where Pam Grier tortures our imprisoned heroine. Needless to say, this is a B-movie in all aspects. Everyone speaks English in Mexico. (I'm sure it's for the movie audience's convenience.) All the Mexicans look Asian and especially sound Asian. I swear to God. The fight scenes are just funny. And the audio is terrible. You have to love B-movies to enjoy ""Women in Cages"". For those that do, I highly recommend it. Highbrow Grade: C-.
Lowbrow Grade: B+. :)",1370563200,,1210,4.529680365296803
