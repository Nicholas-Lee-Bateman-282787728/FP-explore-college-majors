2864856,4,B000RES67S,"This film is typical of its era.  It's dated but amusing and just what you need as a vacation from ""hard hitting drama""",1353196800,3,119,4.173913043478261
2864857,2,B000RES67S,"Murder With Pictures, 1936 film

The film begins with a newspaper headline. Will Neil Girard be acquitted of murder? Will he make a statement to the press? The reporter and the photographer compete for news. The police are searching for a girl at the party. There was a murder of Girard's lawyer. Murdock will get the girl's story. Meg Archer is from Oklahoma. People there were cheated out of oil rights. Murdock falls asleep after drinking with Meg. An intruder attacks Meg, then smashes all the glass photo plates. Did one negative remain? We see a kitchen from that era, and how they toasted bread. Will Murdock's girlfriend enter his apartment and find Meg there? Can Meg leave in a disguise? Where is McGoogin? There is another death. Will someone shoot Meg next? Who is next?

Murdock goes to see Girard for a finals showdown (he believes Meg is dead). There is another surprise when a photograph is developed and shows the people facing Girard's lawyer. What happened to Joe Cusick? ""You're parked by a fire hydrant."" And so there is a happy ending after the murders.

This is a complex story with events and actions that occur with no background explanations. It seems to be created from a collection of events to surprise and amuse the audience. ""The Front Page"" set a high standard for a drama about the newspaper business.",1341446400,,1334,4.741379310344827
2864878,4,B000RES67S,"Really witty script, if you listen for it (or watch it with closed captions).  Gail Patrick is always a treat and worth watching.",1428192000,,129,4.608695652173913

2864881,3,B000RES67S,This was kind of a fun romp. I'm a fan of old movies and especially like to find obscure movies. This one had Lew Ayres in it - a very young Lew Ayres.,1398643200,,151,3.606060606060606
2864882,2,B000RES67S,"I understand that this is a relatively old movie, however, the quality was quite poor and there was often a delay between sound of the voices and the words being spoken. The cost of the movie does not match the quality of the movie.",1394064000,2,232,4.295454545454546
2864883,4,B000RES67S,A little creeky but if you like this stuff you should enjoy it .Nicely acted well presented and the price is OK.,1389571200,3,112,4.136363636363637
2864884,3,B000RES67S,Always nice to see these amazing stars. Lew Ayers always makes the most of any film he is in. Fun and entertaining film,1386547200,,119,4.217391304347826
2864885,3,B000RES67S,"First of all, I love old 30's and early 40's mysteries. I'd never heard of this one but I knew Lew Ayers and I'd never seen Gail Patrick in this type of film. She usually plays a semi-villain - she was the rotten sister in ""My Man Godfrey"". Anyway, it was typical of the old films of this genre - very formulaic: a lot of humor, strange characters, red herrings, silly plot, unbelievable ending, etc. Patrick always plays a similar character: aloof, spoiled, distant, hard, and hard. But, I like her. The move was not memorable but afternoon fun for an old mystery fan like me.",1380844800,5,577,4.452830188679245
2864886,3,B000RES67S,"I enjoyed watching the actors in the film, I had never seen it before.  Sadly, the video quality was poor, it may be a film on the fringe of being lost due to the orginal print.  I hope some group adopts this and remasters it, I'd like to see again.",1373155200,2,249,3.96
2864887,3,B000RES67S,Okay for those few folks left that like these old b&w pictures. I had not seen it before so it wasn't a waste of time.,1370390400,,118,3.76
8200150,2,B000RES67S,"I am a fan of ""old time"" mysteries, but this one really stretched the imagination. Clearly, it was done with no money and very little time available. The plot was ridiculous even by the standards of the day. Acting was as weak as the plot.  I can't believe some people actually gave this dog 5 Stars!!",1500336000,,301,4.375

8200154,2,B000RES67S,Was probably a good film but couldn't understand most of the dialog.,1473984000,,68,4.75
8200155,3,B000RES67S,I gave it a neutral rating. The sound is so muffled I gave up without finishing it.,1473465600,,83,3.9411764705882355
