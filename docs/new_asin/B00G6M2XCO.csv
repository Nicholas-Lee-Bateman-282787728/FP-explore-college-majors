8621079,5,B00G6M2XCO,"This movie pwns!  This is dumb, awesome, action at its best.  I might even like it a little better than the original Deadly Prey, which is saying something, as that is a dumb awesome action classic.  There is just something really exciting about seeing a movie this stupidly amazing made in the 2000 teens.  The fight scenes are awesome, the acting is awesome, the story is awesome and the movie just flat out kicks butt.  I loved it and hope the Prior boys make another!  Not sure what they would call it, though ""Even Deadlier Prey"" maybe?",1425859200,,541,4.525773195876289
8621080,4,B00G6M2XCO,"Deadliest Prey is not just stupid, but a knuckle dragging, drooling, Neanderthal kind of stupid. The easy to follow plot has as much depth and logic as a game of army played by 10 year old kids. With a steady rat-a-tat-tat of guns and asinine dialog, few movies can burn up perfectly good brain cells faster than this exercise in unbridled mayhem.

Still, the energy, and earnest, straight-faced simpleton sincerity of the production results in the kind of mindless and visceral impact you would expect from a live action Road Runner cartoon. A few minutes in, there's some chest thumping macho discourse between key players, promising to kill damn near everybody on screen. The rest of the movie goes about fulfilling that promise.

Deadliest Prey, while technically a sequel, is really a remake of the 1987 low budget cult-hit, Deadly Prey. There are even a few bits of business that serve as a wink to fans of the first kill-fest.

Ted Prior, reprising his role as Mike Danton two and a half decades later, has developed a leathery tough guy posture and presence that was missing in the first installment. (If some Hollywood producer dreams of bringing back Dirty Harry, Ted's your man). While the brutality doesn't quite match the hoot n' holler creativity of the 1980's original, there's an audaciously goofy internet sub-plot that's a real howler. The female member of the nerdy computer hacker group, in particular, is a real piece of work, repeating the phrase ""true dat"" umpteen times, as if it's a religious mantra.

Some of the great A.I.P regulars are back for an encore including Fritz Matthews, and David Campbell, chewing the scenery as the psychotic Colonel John Hogan.

I really got a kick out of the delightfully one dimensional ""Sophia"" character, played with straight faced relish by Tara Kleinpeter. She assures the hero, more than once, that ""it's going to be a lot of fun watching you die!"".  Disappointingly, this sadomasochistic villainous deserved a more ironic and inspired exit than a unceremonious screen splat effect. (David Prior has a long standing, and maddening habit of cutting away from key action).

Overall, Deadliest Prey is like a Three Stooges marathon, except with blood instead of yucks. (Don't even suggest this as a date movie, unless your date is named Jim Beam or Jack Daniels).  In a properly addled state of mind, Deadliest Prey is a helluva lot of dumb fun. True dat!",1422662400,,2417,4.921375921375922
8621081,4,B00G6M2XCO,This would have gotten the full 5 stars but I had to knock it down one because no cut-offs!,1412640000,,91,3.8421052631578947
8621082,5,B00G6M2XCO,"I was crazy excited when I heard there was a sequel to Deadly Prey. And now, after watching it, I can safely say it was worth every penny! It might seem like a silly film to anybody that hasn't seen the original. But to anybody familiar with the first Deadly Prey, this is the exact follow-up it needed.",1387497600,,303,4.241379310344827
8621083,5,B00G6M2XCO,"Wow, I watched Deadly Prey (part one) on a cable ch in 1988. I always was, and am to this day a huge B movie fan. DP was without a doubt my all time fav. Living in South Jersey at the time NO video rental store had DP for rent. After searching dozens of stores I found it and made my own bootleg copy. I was a senior in high school and can remember making dozens of copies for my friends, everyone love it!. Back then no store sold VHS tapes, and if they did it was a special order from the rental store they retailed for 79.99 and up, it wasn't like today. From Deadly Prey I became a fan of all Ted and David Prior films.

When I heard online a few yrs ago that there was going to be a 2nd movie Deadliest Prey I couldn't believe it!! I per-ordered the film, was able to get a signed copy by Ted Prior himself. I have to admit I was nervous that it wasn't going to be good... Gladly I was completely Wrong. In some ways its as much of a remake as it is a sequel.. I loved this movie! its really fun!!! Cheesy action, cheesy one liners that has the makings of another cult following. If your a fan of Deadly Prey its a must see for sure! David Prior did a great job staying true to the original. You gotta love an actor and director making a movie strictly for the fans of the original.

David Campbell who plays Col. Hogan was great in this one! same funny one liners and cheesy dialogue that we loved in the first film. Fritz Matthews is back playing the part of his twin brother (who got killed in the first one) and totally nailed it. He looks exactly the same as he did 25 yrs ago. And Ted Prior as Danton again steels the show. I was hopen he would have the long hair. He's still in great shape but, it would have been cool if he hit a cycle of juice and got ripped up.

Over all a really fun movie, a must have for any Deadly Prey fan.. And the bonus materiel is great with almost 90 mins in interviews, deleted scenes, behind the scenes etc. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!",1383955200,,1968,4.002544529262087
