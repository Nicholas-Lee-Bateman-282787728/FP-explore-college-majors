4649898,4,B005BXY1Q0,I purchased this as gift for my grandchild as requested by my daughter.  My grandchild has several Veggie Tales DVDs.  Each Veggie Tale has a lesson to learn.,1323302400,,158,4.607142857142857
4649899,3,B005BXY1Q0,It was disappointing that they didn't stay more true to the original's ending. The ending in the original was so touching when the sheep was healed by Jesus. Kind of sad how this ended. I don't usually write reviews but the powerful ending just wasn't there like in the original.,1322956800,,279,4.6
4649900,5,B005BXY1Q0,"First off I should mention, we have never seen VeggieTales before but I am glad we finally have!  My 3 year old loved this DVD!  He laughed and laughed over vegetables dancing and talking!  Once he got over that I was able to show him lessons learned from Veggie Tales, like forgiveness and friendship.  There are funny songs and references (Star Wars is one) throughout the movie, that I don't mind watching it with them, because of course they have to watch it now over and over!  The story does start out sad but turns around and how can you not smile from singing and talking vegetables!  I also have a feeling we will be watching this DVD long past Christmas!",1320969600,9,664,4.446280991735537
4649901,5,B005BXY1Q0,"VeggieTales has yet again done what they do best - taken a big story with important moral, historical, and faith lessons, and made it creative and engaging in a way kids can relate to. This is a heartwarming story that families should gather around and watch together. The lessons of forgiveness and using you best gifts to serve the Lord are powerful for all ages to be reminded of. This is one we will watch every Christmas!",1320710400,,426,4.545454545454546
4649902,5,B005BXY1Q0,I've been buying VeggieTales for my niece and nephew since they were 2 years old and they LOVE them!  We love starting Christmas early so I got The Little Drummer Boy and watched with them last night.  It was another hit! It has us laughing the whole time and I love that they are learning valuable lessons in a fun way.  I just found a VeggieTales toy Drum that I'm going to surprise my nephew with and a set of VeggieTales Little Drummer Boy Characters for my neice.  I got them the Veggie Nativity set last year and it was their favorite Christmas toy so they will flip when they get these. I love being their favorite uncle!,1320710400,,628,4.296610169491525
4649903,5,B005BXY1Q0,"This video is a must-buy for all parents with kids. It teaches the biblical Christmas story in a different way, making it fun as all Veggietales do. My kids get so excited with any VeggieTales dvd, but this one is even better since it has a Christmas theme (and what kid doesn't like to watch something about Christmas?!) The Silly Song of course doesn't disappoint as well. I even enjoy watching it as a mom!",1320710400,,409,4.466666666666667
4649904,5,B005BXY1Q0,"My children love everything that VeggieTales produces and the absolutely love the new VeggieTales DVD, The Little Drummer Boy! In wonderful Veggie-style, the telling of the story of the little drummer boy comes to life through the adorable Junior Asparagus. As soon as I pop this DVD in, my kids are glued to the television. And most importantly, they're learning amazing lessons!",1320710400,3,380,5.145161290322581
4649905,4,B005BXY1Q0,"Junior Asparagus has become obsessed with the drums, playing them all the time.  While his parents go out Christmas shopping, he is supposed to go caroling with his friends, but a mix up leaves him home with Grandpa (Pa Grape).  Mad at his friends, Junior intends to sulk, but Grandpa decides to tell him the story of the little drummer boy.

Back in the time of the Romans lived a little boy named Aaron (Junior again) who had a happy home life and a gift with a drum that could make animals dance.  When his family home is destroyed, he sets out with just the animals left, determined to live as isolated a life as possible.  Will he stay angry or will he have an encounter with the newborn king?

This episode appears to be based on a story, or at least inspired by it, but I'm not familiar with the source material.  The story is very tragic at the beginning, and you can really understand Aaron's anger, a theme that is played out through the entire story.  And yet, when the climax comes, it is suddenly all washed away - it's just too easy.  The resolution needed more context to the story.

Along the way, we do get some great humor with the characters that Aaron meets along the way.  I especially loved the Star Wars references at one point.

They've finally animated ""The 8 Polish Foods of Christmas"" from the mid-90's Christmas CD, and it's still a hoot.

For much of this DVD, I was enjoying the story despite the sad beginning.  I just wish that the climax had included more of a lesson; as it is, it was over all too quick.",1317513600,12,1538,4.350877192982456
4649906,5,B005BXY1Q0,"I was wondering how long it was going to take the folks at Big Idea to do this story.  I am sure I will love it when it comes out, as I write this the item is on pre-order but I'm giving it 5 stars because Bob & Larry never let us down, we have them all!",1314230400,3,254,3.456140350877193

4649989,5,B005BXY1Q0,"Our 2-year-old loved the movie.  The message is positive.  However, if you are not prepared to comfort your very young child and explain that this is fiction and that the drummer boy will be okay you should probably skip this one.  We were fine with it - we snuggled our little one and helped her deal with her emotions as the little drummer boy dealt with the ugliness that life threw at him.  We also got to see her enjoy the music and celebrate with the happy ending.
I would say the story line is pretty close to other drummer boys I've seen, except (spoiler) the parents live.",1450051200,,581,4.351851851851852
4649990,1,B005BXY1Q0,"My 5 year old was crying in the first 8 minutes of the movie-- when Aaron can't find his parents and his house is seen smoldering. WHAT??!! Who thought that was a good way to set a stage for the drummer boy?? I don't care how sensitive or old your kid is.  At this point, the movie was turned off and I looked to read reviews and wondered how it was 4.5 stars. PLEASE don't watch this movie or have your kids watch it! EVen if this movie takes a turn for the good, its not worth it.

JR is also a brat in the first 8 minutes and I agree with the comments that its not what I want my kiddos watching and equating to the story of our Savior's birth.  This world is ugly enough without having to make a kid's CHRISTMAS movie all dark and tragic.",1449619200,3,742,3.966442953020134

4650037,5,B005BXY1Q0,"This Veggie Tales Christmas episode is some what a remake of the classic stop-motion Christmas movie. It sticks really well to the original version, but added some things to make it less scary and fun. It also shows a message about forgiving others even during the holidays. In the episode, Junior is waiting for his friends for they can go Christmas Caroling. But during his excitement, he fail to hear his friends ringing the doorbell, making them think Junior not there and decided to start without him. This lead Junior to believe his friends ditch him and vows not to speak to them ever again. Pa Grape tries to convince Junior that he shouldn't hold a grudge and  should forgive his friends. To prove a point he tells him a story about a little drummer boy who hold a grudge against everyone in the world after some bad people destroyed his home and his family. But one special night will change his life forever.

4650132,4,B005BXY1Q0,Very cute movie for all ages. The songs are entertaining and of course it has a good lesson. My two year old wanted to keep watching over and over. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it isn't an actual Bible story like some of the other veggie tales. I wish it talked a little more about the birth of Jesus,1417910400,,323,3.9846153846153847

It was very devasting to her.  SPOILER ALERT!!  In the end they do come back but at the time we did not know that as it appears they were murdered and he was left all alone to wander the desert.  Not your typical Veggie Tale  movie.",1410393600,,385,4.277777777777778
4650166,2,B005BXY1Q0,"While I typically LOVE LOVE LOVE veggie tails, I did not like their adaptation of Little Drummer Boy.  In the original the drummer boy's pet lamb is miraculously healed by The Baby Jesus.  But in this one, its the ""Dr"" that heals the lamb.  While I fully understand that sometimes God will work miracles through other people, the new version lost something when they took that ""miracle"" out.  Just my opinion.  Some other people may like the more ""realistic"" version I guess, but to me it opens up doubt, was it God or man that did the healing?  I like believing the unbelievable, isn't that what faith is all about?",1410048000,,616,4.554545454545455

The reason children's stories do not have parents or adults near or alive is simply this; there is no appeal for children when there is an adult hovering around in stories. Adults represent dependence, and if the adults are gone, there is a sense of independence and survival.

However, there are scenes where parents disappear, a child is left alone, a favorite animal is sold, etc.  Not exactly a feel-good movie in those aspects.  It does tell a decent story about forgiving and giving our best gift to God.  I think they could have focused more on the Jesus story so as not to confuse the children.  Parents, you need to BE there to tell them about things or they will get confused.  Overall, pretty good story.",1364083200,,532,4.489583333333333
4650568,4,B005BXY1Q0,"The theme song is always a favorite of mine and has been since I first watched VeggieTales. I was pretty disappointed, though, that in some of the recent DVDs they don't play the whole theme song. But many shows have done that and it's a little thing in comparison to all the awesome things that the shows are full of.

The Little Drummer Boy stars Junior Asparagus, who I really love by the way. He has always been one of my favorite characters. He's just too cute for words. Most if not all people know about the little drummer boy. It's just such a classic song, so putting it to video is pretty amazing. One of my favorite parts of this DVD is how in the story portion they have two French peas named ""May"" and ""Wee"" - that was so clever to me. Another great part is the animals in the story - sheep, donkey and camel - that ended up doing a little dance in the movie which was so cute to me.

Now Junior is really getting into drumming, so when Pa Grape tells him a Christmas story, he picks the perfectly fitting story of Aaron as a drummer. It's such a great way to show kids the story of baby Jesus. It's not totally all about the Christmas story, but it shows a different perspective of someone who didn't know anything about Jesus being born and suddenly coming across him from somewhere else. It's a great story for sure.

The silly song portion of the movie was fun to watch for sure. I knew about the 8 Polish Foods of Christmas song before. Seeing that come to video was super amusing.",1361923200,,1499,4.252631578947368

I heard the show in the background several times as I busied about and from that I know it was 1) in the Christmas Spirit 2) well received 3) musically inspiring :)

The only thing that I noticed about this video was Junior's perpetual bad attitude.  My youngest brother has some mental difficulties and this causes him to pick up on a lot of negative attitudes right away.

4650591,2,B005BXY1Q0,"I was hoping to introduce my nephew and his family to the VeggieTales series of movies and I selected this as the starting DVD to give them as a gift unpreviewed.  Unfortunately it seems this was the wrong place to start and there may have been better choices available.  First off, my nephew likes the music CD I gave him the prior year so it seemed like a good time to give what appeared to be a Christmas themed VeggieTales DVD as he is now around two and a half years old.  We all sat to watch this gift DVD and I could tell it wasn't being received well by anyone in the room including my nephew.  The adults were yawning, one actually fell asleep watching it, I tried to enjoy it as it was my gift, but found it hard to like this story as well as the jokes all fell flat and the story and characters were all hard to like.  My nephew kept asking to watch Mickey Mouse instead while this was on.  A clear disappointment and it will be hard to give any future gifts in this series after this poor introduction to the VeggieTales movies.  Avoid this one and go with the Rankin and Bass version which I found to be a much better Drummer Boy story told with a heart and better representation of the true meaning of Christmas.",1324857600,,1226,4.191489361702128

Since there is no ""official"" Little Drummer Boy story (that I could find) I had hoped the producers would come up with something unique, biblical, and of course funny. I was hoping for something along the lines of the parable of the Widow's Mite, giving our heart to Jesus especially at Christmas, etc.  This movie is almost word for word, (same characters, same plot, same scenery)as the clay animation story from the late 60's early 70's.

4650594,1,B005BXY1Q0,"I was very disappointed in this VeggieTales movie and would not recommend it to anyone.  Most of the movie was dark...then ends with a short biblically incorrect positive feel good message.  Here is a summary of what happens.

1)  Aaron is a boy who gets a drum.  He is friends with a few animals and one day comes back to his house burnt down and you assume his parents are dead.

2)  He hates people and goes off on his own instead of seeking help.  Ends up with very bad people who try to exploit him.

3)  People exploit him and then end up selling his camel who is one of his friends.  (this is when my 5 year old was crying and asking why the people are mean and Aaron didn't get a good adult to help him)  The buyers are the three Magi (wise men) who are following a star.  So, Aaron again goes off on his own towards the star.

4)  The star leads Aaron to the Magi but before he gets to him one of his other friends, the sheep, gets run over by a cart and is near death.

5)  The wise men are there in front of baby Jesus in the manger with some shepherds.  (Even Snopes know this is an urban myth and Jesus was a small boy and not an infant when the Magi came)

6)  Aaron as in the song plays his drum for baby Jesus since he had no gift for him and sees his parents there who takes care of the injured sheep.

I wish I could return this movie and I probably won't buy next year's VeggieTales Christmas movie (we have Star, Toy that Saved, St Nicholas, and Meaningful life) before viewing it now.",1323820800,16,1505,4.016891891891892
4650595,1,B005BXY1Q0,"I am a big fan of having family Christmas movie time. However, if you are looking for entertainment value, skip this and grab you a copy of Elf, Charlie Brown Christmas, or The Grinch. This is not nearly so artful nor creative as VeggieTales has been in the past. And ultimately, I'd skip it.

If movies that are just sort of thrown together a la a fifth grader's short story for English class bother you because of poor writing, overdone plot elements, contrived and clunky conflict and resolution, and unlikable/unsympathetic characters, you'll also want to skip this one. It's kind of a kids' version of a cheesy Lifetime movie with old 80s sitcom stars from supporting roles.

And if you look to VeggieTales as an aide in teaching your children about the Bible and hope to find this as a way to relate to them the true meaning of Christmas, you're REALLY going to want to skip it--

I just watched this for the second time with two of my children (8 and 5) and asked them what they thought it was about. They got it right for the most part, they said it's about a little boy who thinks his parents have died. He's really sad and lost for a while and gets in with an odd (the kids seem confused about their character) crowd but then eventually finds his parents at the end. That about sums it up. Junior plays two characters, the Drummer Boy in the story set at the time of Christ's birth, and himself in the story set in modern times. The character from the part set in modern day is, in a word, smarmy. The character of the Drummer Boy is an Anakin Skywalker of sorts who, while not as dark as the future Darth Vader, is completely consumed by the death of his parents. First of all, why do so many writers of children's stories decide that one or both parents should be missing? It is not only overdone, it is a weak plot device. The stakes need not be so high, and relying on such a worn out and overly dramatic scenario seems lazy. Second of all, the change in the Drummer Boy is intended, upon close examination (and really because we are told rather than shown), to come when he sees Jesus. However, the Drummer Boy sees Jesus almost instantly before he is reunited with his parents, so the whole reason for the change in him is lost on children. They think the Drummer Boy is happy now because he has found his parents, not because he has found his Savior. Honestly, it's only because I know that Jesus is the Savior that I even inferred that message. It's debatable that it's even there.

Shouldn't the point of a VeggieTales Christmas movie set at the birth of Christ BE the birth of Christ? There are many of us out there who think that the quality of VeggieTales has gone down significantly since the departure of Phil Vischer as CEO in 2003. The messages are watered down and the artistic and creative quality has certainly suffered. A friend asked me recently why I still even let my children watch VeggieTales. My answer to that is that they are better than a whole lot of the other things out there that they could be watching. On the other hand, there are also a whole lot of things out there that would be more educational! It used to be that VeggieTales communicated the stories of the Bible in an accessible way for children. It was an aide in teaching them what we want them to learn about God and his people. This movie does not do that. There is nothing in it that shows children how the birth of Christ changes anything, much less everything! What a missed opportunity for Big Idea! If you are looking for something new this Christmas that helps teach children (and remind us all) what Christmas is all about, grab you a copy of Song of the Stars, Sally Lloyd-Jones' new book that is beautifully and artfully written to help us share the story of how the long-expected birth of our Savior changed the world.",1323648000,13,3834,4.426345609065156
