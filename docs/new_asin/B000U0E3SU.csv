8211663,5,B000U0E3SU,"WOW...this is an amazing documentary...just enough ""talking  heads"" to keep the story moving but TONS and TONS of great action footage. I think if most players in the game had ONE play as good as any of the literally couple hundred shown during  this hour plus film...they's cherish it.  As youngster living  in  Southern California during  his heyday...I  read about Orr in sports illustrated but seeing  this footage  is a revelation and I now  understand why fans say he's better than Gretzky and I'd have to agree...he is just much more multi-dimensional.  I  don't know  what is more awe inspiring...his intercepting a pass and  taking it the full length to score, his  throwing  himself head first (without a helmet) to cover an empty net on defense or his flat out speed...this guy was ridiculous.

I purchased on Amazon Canada for under $20  ...and I  think  Mr Orr sells  them on his site so don't pay 89 dollars..",1210464000,11,923,4.751592356687898
8211664,5,B000U0E3SU,"Orr is the best hockey player who ever lived...plain and simple.  Anybody who knows anything about hockey should agree.  Sure Gretzky was an offensive genius, but did you see him checking guys, blocking shots, fighting or killing penalties single-handedly??  I don't think so.  5 Orr's against 5 Gretzky's it would be no contest.  Winning Best defenseman in the league and at the same time winnin the scoring title(twice) equals total and utter domination of your sport.  Thus, he was a target for cheap shots from Goons like Bobby Clarke, Pat Quinn and Bill Barber who did not know what else to do.  We all know the rest as Orr retired in his prime at the tender age of 30.  One of the biggest disappointments in sports history.  This dvd shows a lot of what he could do.  I just ordered it and I'm assuming it's the same as the 'best of' VHS tape that I owned years ago.  The best, by far, Bobby Orr",1185753600,10,901,4.432926829268292
8211665,5,B000U0E3SU,"If you never got to see Bobby Orr play, this vidoe shows you some of his greatest highlights. You really can't capture the impact Orr had on the game of hockey by watching a video, but it does show you how he dominated the game. The video reviews his career on a year by year basis and shows his ability to play the game of hockey at both ends of the ice. I recommend this video for all hockey fans.",1065139200,6,399,4.0
8211666,5,B000U0E3SU,"For those hockey lovers and historians, this tape is a must.
Bobby Orr is considered by most ""in the know"" to be the most talented player to ever set skate on the ice.  He single-handedly and fundamentally changed how the game was played.  This documentary captures the essence of Bobby Orr, ""hockey prodigy"", kind-hearted and modest human being who played the game for the love of it.",1028592000,4,385,4.731343283582089
8211667,5,B000U0E3SU,"This was an excellent video of Bobby Orr.  The film clips of him as a kid in Parry Sound, Ontario were neat to see.  The video gave an excellent biography of Bobby's development from a boy to a young man and showed how  his career as a NHL player developed.  Bobby participated in the interview,  during the making of this video, and it was wonderful to see him again.  The film clips were excellent, showing Bobby's amazing ability on the ice.  Bobby Orr was and still is a great sportsman.  His teammates, coaches and  former opponents had really great insight into Bobby's awesome talent.  It  was really great to hear from Don Cherry and of course Espo!  It was also  great to see Derek Sanderson, Larry Robinson, the Legendary Gordie Howe,  and others.  One of them put it best when he said that ""Bobby Orr is a  better person than hockey player"".  Bobby earned such respect from so  many, including me.  Bobby Orr will always be a legend in my mind.  Like  Don Cherry said in the video, ""Bobby Orr:  The greatest hockey player  in the world, and I love him!""  You were the greatest, Bobby!",926640000,13,1095,4.469387755102041
