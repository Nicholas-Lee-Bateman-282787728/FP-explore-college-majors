420666,5,630207472X,"This was one of Hammett's better mysteries and the movie did it justice. Of course the movie gave his detective (The Continental Op) a name which the book did not but, it also gave us James Coburn as the detective. and the DVD provided a complete uncut version. My favorite mystery writer and one of my favoite actors.",1246924800,,318,4.5
420667,5,630207472X,"It might seem a little presumptious of me to give this miniseries 5 stars since I have never seen the complete miniseries. Yet I saw part of this on my little 12 inch black and white TV many years ago when it was first released. Missed the rest due to a night job at the university.  What I saw was absolutely astounding and I'm going to buy it as soon as I find it on sale. For 30 years those images have been etched for me. Extraordinarily atmospheric! (Was that the black & white picture working its magic?) Great sets with wonderful music! Story? It's Hammett! (For you noir fans that means the same writer who wrote ""The Maltese Falcon."")",1246492800,,643,4.358333333333333
420668,5,630207472X,"This movie is one of the best detective movies ever made.  I would rank it with the 1940 production of The Maltese Falcon.  Coburn is perfect as private detective Hamilton Nash, and the rest of the cast deliver matchless performances that only the finest actors can.  I have waited for a good reproduction of this masterpiece since I first saw it on television in the late 1970's, and I am thrilled to have it on a DVD of my own.  Bravo!",1153267200,,437,4.3580246913580245
420669,4,630207472X,"To date, this is the most complete version of the the tv miniseries from 1978 and a most satisfying watch it is!! The running time is 4hours and 40 minutes. Image Entertainment has done a great job of restoring this almost classic to its full glory. It may not be a classic like The Maltese Falcon (John Huston version), The Thin Man or The Glass Key (Alan Ladd version) but it is still a very well made movie.(DO NOT settle for the truncated versions on video tape 1 1/2hrs and just over two hours)the story line is too garbled for that short of run time and many, many scenes are deleted!? Why did it take 27 years for this movie to be seen in it's complete and uncut version? This movie may gall some hardcore Hammett readers because The Continental Op has a name, the name of the agency is changed and the setting is changed to New York, but the ENTIRE storyline is left intact and the time period is correct in every detail, so what's the problem? Forget the minor changes, sit back, and enjoy a minor television miniseries classic!",1125100800,37,1037,4.40625
420670,4,630207472X,"The adaption of Dashiell Hammet's ""The Dain Curse"" was indeed a complex and enjoyable mini-series, which screened on Australian television back when it was first made. An edited version of the series was released on video and as the previous reviewer stated, it made no sense and was a waste of time and money. However, if you take a closer look at the cover image for this release, it clearly states that it is the ""Original Unedited Miniseries"". If this is the case, then this video is a worthy inclusion to the collection of any fan of crime/mystery television. Having said that, apparently a DVD version is scheduled for release in May 2005. Wooohooo!",1109116800,3,655,4.754385964912281
420691,4,630207472X,"Just re-read The Dain Curse (read it about 30 years ago), so I thought I'd watch this miniseries originally broadcast on CBS in 1978.  I liked it.  There are some changes, but overall, the miniseries is very faithful to the book.  The location was moved to New York from San Francisco.  This was probably for economic reasons -- the studio back-lots serve as New York in the 1920s; easier to do than San Francisco in the 1920s.  Another big variation is having James Coburn playing the role of the Continental Op (the Op is short and stout, like Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit), but Coburn acquits himself nicely as a Hammett-style detective.  Other minor changes: Coburn's character has a name (Hamilton Nash) and the Continental Detective Agency has a different name.  There is also a trial at the end that serves as the denouement, which is not in the book.  None of these changes detracted from my enjoyment.  It all worked rather well.  Much of the dialogue is lifted from the book (like John Huston did with the Maltese Falcon).  Even a reference to Folsom Prison is left in even though it doesn't quite make sense geographically from an East Coast law enforcement officer.  Read the book, then check out this miniseries.  And check out Hammett's other Continental Op stories.  I look forward to someone making a miniseries out of Red Harvest.",1395964800,2,1357,4.743589743589744
420692,1,630207472X,"Sadly, it was not close captioned, so it's usefulness was minor. The cast was stellar and that was why it was ordered, but, without captions...",1385856000,,143,4.76
420693,5,630207472X,"one of the best roles that james coburn has played, he fits the character like a glove. enjoyed him in the flint series that stereotyped him with a big toothy smile. in this he is a non-smiling and serious character and he carries it off perfectly.",1379808000,,248,4.413043478260869
420694,1,630207472X,"Amazon blurb describes this as the full, unedited version (~6 hours),
but in reality this is the badly chopped 2.5 hour version.",1366156800,7,128,4.863636363636363
420695,5,630207472X,"I didn't remember much about this but I know I saw it when first aired and always
wanted to see it again! It's a great mystery detective story with many twist and
turns and James Coburn is excellent. The video is not the uncut version as stated
but it's worth getting anyway. I love 70's tv movies and if you do too you'll like this.",1359676800,,333,4.138461538461539
420696,2,630207472X,"This review is about the VHS edition of The Dain Curse with ""Original Unedited Miniseries"" on the case and in the title listed on Amazon. If you really want the complete miniseries, you need to keep looking -- carefully. The running time for this edition is listed on Amazon (as I write) as 360 minutes. That's six hours. A reviewer states that this miniseries runs 4 hours and forty minutes. On the back of the video cassette case, the running time is given as approximately 192 minutes. However, the actual running time of the tape I received (in a case without shrink wrap but with a proper-looking label on the cassette) was a little over two hours. Even at the length stated on the case, this edition cannot be the complete miniseries if the figure of 4h 40m is correct. And there's no telling where the Amazon figure of six hours comes from. My low rating for this item is due to the unsatisfactory length, not the entertainment value of the movie.",1328918400,9,954,4.5523255813953485
420697,5,630207472X,"I have wanted to see ""The Dain Curse"" again ever since I watched it on television 33 years ago. James Coburn may not be Sir Laurence Olivier, but he nails the noir story and setting. It was one of the best mini-series of its time, and hasn't lost a bit of its appeal. A pox on whoever thought it was a good idea to edit it almost by half for a VHS version, and kudos for whoever finally succeeded in making the whole production available.",1325116800,,438,4.1647058823529415
420698,5,630207472X,"Full disclosure: I'm going to be a little controversial here. Over last weekend, while on a train trip, I watched all of the 1978 miniseries of The Dain Curse (you can get it on netflix or amazon). It stars James Coburn in a pretty faithful adaptation of the novel.  While I struggled with the first 15 minutes of the dvd, I came to really really like it and view it as a minor classic. And while it's easy to get caught up in the great styling, fashion, period architecture, cars, etc. in the miniseries, the best thing about it is:

* It makes the novel better.  While Dain Curse has a lot of good episodes in it, it feels often, well, episodic. Like it was written at different times. STructurally, the whole Quesada episode seems tagged on and disconnected, at least to me.

The mini series solves this by putting the Op's attraction to Gabrielle at the heart of the story, instead of as a weird addendum in the Third Act.  While this may humanize and romanticize the Op to some people's dislike, i think it makes the story hold better.  Coburn isn't my favorite actor, but, boy, he aces this role.

I think this may even be better than Maltese Falcon as a screen adaptation of Hammett. It's not a movie (5 hours long), it looks like a Masterpiece Theater kind of show (video,cheapie sets), but still: this one really works. Give it a try.",1270857600,8,1343,4.434959349593496
420699,5,630207472X,"James Coburn is an actor who no matter which role he plays, one wants to watch him act. Like for example; you want to listen to Caruso or to Maria Callas even if the songs they sometimes sing is not the greatest. You still are enthralled by their voices and their interpretation. The Dain Curse is a great show based on a great book and is played by James Coburn and by Nancy Addison (who by the way, looks and acts in this show, far better than in any other of her films or shows, in a masterful manner.",1268006400,2,504,4.101010101010101
420700,4,630207472X,"Love the quality of the movie
I have a high def wide screen tv
went to the ROOT MENU
the audio had an echo like the sound in a movie theatre
Adjusted the audio from Theatre to Living Room and that corrected the music
BUT I still got the echo on my tv for the talking

I played it on my computer--and worked very well

I will have to deal with my tv later!  It readjusted the whole tv system.
Ah the good old days before HD and all that jazz!
There must be a sound adjustment I haven't adjusted yet.",1254873600,,498,3.910891089108911

7820681,5,630207472X,"As John HUSTON stuck to the original Dashiell Hammitt novel,The Maltese falcon,which guaranteed a masterpiece,this sticks to the original,and is wonderful. I only wish James Coburn had done more as the op.,unfortunately no more stories,by Coburn. The original Op. Was middle aged,thinning hair,overweight, but Coburn rather resembles Hammitt,and they give him a name,which  the Op. Never had. Hamilton Nash(Dashiell Hammitt,Hamilton Nash)get the joke? But then again BOGART wasn't blonde,but these actors fit so well you forget that they don't look like the descriptions in the books.

This won't bother everyone, but my husband really needs close captioning so we can't enjoy this together.

The movies today are interesting if your curious how many gallons of gas they used to destroy everything standing in the hero's way. Watching James Coburn brought back so many great memories of the movies I really enjoyed during the years The story was confusing at times, but Coburn was there keeping us calm and confident that all would be made clear in the end. He made the movie a great experience. I'm looking for more of his works to watch.",1396310400,,494,4.428571428571429
