8213663,4,B000UL61H0,"I purchased this from Amazon's UK site, mainly because it was cheaper and I understood it to be a good print. The Conzumel transfer of this film was supposed to be ""better"" than the Cinemateca version, which believe me isn't saying much for the latter. On the other hand, despite a few imperfections, this Mr. Bongo version was clearly taken from about as good a print as one could hope for. Maybe not pristine, but still remarkably sharp compared to the other versions. It is PAL, but PCs and all-region DVD players will play it. If you are interested in this early Bunuel effort before he migrated to France and made his better known films, this is by far the best print available.",1509926400,,683,4.560975609756097
8213664,3,B000UL61H0,"Beware. This Cinemateca version is listed as Region 1 (USA & Canada only) but would not play on my Region 1 (USA) players. It played up to the menu and then froze. The film did play on a universal (PAL) player. This is the 3rd Cinemateca film I have purchased that would not play on my Region 1 (USA) DVD players. However, a couple other Cinemateca films advertised as  Region 1 did play on them.",1508457600,,396,4.28
8213665,4,B000UL61H0,"""El bruto"" (""The Brute"") from 1952, was directed by none other than Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. This was a social-melodrama that was very much in keeping with this period of his career. It had a fine cast in: 'Pedro' 'el bruto' (Pedro Armendariz), 'Paloma' (Katy Jurado), 'Meche' (Rosa Arenas), 'Andres Cabrera' (Andres Soler), 'Don Pepe' (Paco Martinez), etc. This tale of social-oppression is about a landlord ('Andres'), that wanted to evict poor squatters from his property (a common problem in Latin America, even today). The squatters resisted, so he hired a brutish slaughterhouse-worker ('el bruto'), to scare and intimidate the few troublemakers. After a mishap, 'Andres' had to give 'el bruto' asylum in his home, where more problems ensued for the basically gentle at heart but outwardly crude 'el bruto', in 'Andres' calculating wife 'Paloma', who was hatching schemes of her own! Until one day, 'el bruto', now filled with remorse and regret for his actions, thanks to the compassion and generosity that only 'Meche' had displayed.

Overall, this was a very decent film that was co-written by another fellow Spanish-expatriate Luis Alcoriza, where many classical motifs were represented. Then again so is 'Don Pepe' (Paco Martinez), whose accent was easily discernible to be a Spaniard. He also provided some well-timed comic-relief. So much of Mexico's so-called 'golden age of cinema' was the result of exiles from many countries, but from Spain primarily. Some reviewers make the claim that there wasn't any of Bu&ntilde;uel's usual touch of 'surrealism' at all in the film. Maybe they lack experience, or didn't see the same film I did. There certainly was a little surrealism involved, just ever so slightly. I don't want to spoil it by spelling-it-out, so I won't. Arguably, it was more of a neorealist work, and a very nice one at that. Katy Jurado was at the height of her sensual-power here, this woman exuded sex from every pore of her body! She was a magnificent actress to watch. I noticed Bu&ntilde;uel shot her in slight soft-focus, yet you could still see the hair on her arms! Very smart of him, this helped create an atmosphere of pure sexual-energy around her. I highly recommend this one and you don't have to be familiar with Bu&ntilde;uel's work to follow it. Highly enjoyable! The DVD picture quality was excellent. NTSC, Spanish (English subtitles), NR 83 mins. (BTW: Anthony Quinn would go on to play this type of character in one of the most memorable performances of his career, two years later in Fellini's ""La strada"" 1954.)

8213667,5,B000UL61H0,"El Bruto is a strange movie about.. well a brute, a tough guy who is hired to do the dirty work for a tyrannical landlord who is trying to get rid of his impoverished tenants.. But as events unfold the movie takes some ironic plot twists... Punctuated with moments of comedy mainly from the father of the slumlord, El Bruto is a strange and beautiful early film of don luis... It is beautiful in its simplicity and in its photography.. and its story is unconventional and unique..
The quality of the dvd itself was better than i expected.. just don't expect any extras and you will be fine with the more than acceptable print of the film - at least in my eyes..",1202774400,3,661,4.382113821138211

8213669,5,B000UL61H0,"The well known sojourn of Bunuel in Mexico has been unfairly regarded for most audiences: I think, on the contrary that this self exile in this land, plenty of mystery and rituals not only nourished still more the fertile creativity of him; but enriched his surrealistic vision about the overall pattern of behavior of the human being. Possibly, if Bunuel would not have lived n Mexico, films like Nazarin, Viridiana or the crimila life of Archibaldo de la Cruz simply would have not made.

In this sense, El Bruto is perhaps, one of his most devastating and delirious visions about the servile and tyrannical abuse of a landowner respect a tough slaughter laborer. Moments of bitter irony and melodramatic vignettes make of this film one of his smartest ones.

A must-see.",1194307200,3,773,4.893129770992366
