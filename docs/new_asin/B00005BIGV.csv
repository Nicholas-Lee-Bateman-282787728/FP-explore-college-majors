7937564,5,B00005BIGV,"""Your Two Month Old"" is absolutely the best and most valuable resource a new parent (or parent-to-be!) could receive.

Dr. Plonsky is charming. His voice is soothing and reassuring; the information is presented in an easy to listen to manner without ANY ""talking down"" to us new parents. He feels like the comfortable Family Doctor everyone wished they had growing up. But most of all, he's incredibly well educated in Infant Growth And Development, staying current on updates and recent developments and findings in the medical and neurological world - he knows his stuff!

This video is so chock-full of important tips and help on your child's development, I can't even begin to cover it all, suffice it to say this could easily become your ""bible"" of early parenting!

I like the video format too, much easier to stick a tape in while feeding/rocking Baby than trying to flip through the pages of a book!",1217548800,,907,4.838709677419355
