4473914,5,B004UXVEUS,"I resisted watching this show because I was a huge ALIAS fan, which is about the dumbest reason on the planet. I finally broke down when a friend of mine was telling me about how wonderful it was, and I bought the first season on Amazon. I then went on a marathon, watching it all twice, and then gathering up all the episodes of season two. The parallels with ALIAS end at it being about a female agent in the CIA. Covert Affairs doesn't suffer from the heady mythology that ALIAS did. Anyone can pop into this show at any point and enjoy the heck out of it. Annie Walker, Joan and Arthur Campbell are terrific characters. I never expected to like Jai Wilcox, but I do. My favorite character is Auggie Anderson who touched a spot in my heart. This show is brilliant, and if you like spies you should watch it.",1313020800,65,810,4.300653594771242

4474262,5,B004UXVEUS,"The USA Network television series ""Covert Affairs"" is a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable combination of an exciting espionage thriller, and an engaging interpersonal drama. This second season continues to follow the exploits of Annie Walker, an intrepid young CIA operative, who demonstrates intelligence and wisdom beyond her years, in her pursuit of the successful completion of her designated missions. ""Covert Affairs"" features superb writing, acting, and plot development, and the performances of the lead actors, Piper Perabo and Christopher Gorham, are truly exceptional. ""Covert Affairs"" is an outstanding television series, and I give its second season a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1486339200,5,724,5.971153846153846

This season, I went thru in two days. Barely slept...he,he.....
Very good season and the whole show is very ""life-like"" and ""honest"" in away. No ""crazy James Bond-stuff"", but more ""real"" in a way.
LOVE THIS SHOW and can really recommend it.

Characters have famiy and friends who care and add dimension.  Violence is measured and not self-serving.  CIA is the vehicle for all that may seem is not what is always what it appears to be.  Professional persona is in conflict with personal honesty.  We can handle the truth when it is fictionalized, one episode at a time.

Clear as not what I finally figured out she was supposed to say. ""Depends who's watching."" A stage actor wouldn't mumble. TV actors, gawrd.

The director has heard the script, so he hears what he wants to hear. Brains fill in gaps, especially when they know what goes in the gaps. It even became almost clear to me when I knew what was being said. Someone in TV & movies should be in charge of demumblification.

Tons of product placement. The number of Bud Light bottles carefully turned toward the camera, or Breyers Ice Cream cartons, or the Apple logo on the iphones, blech. Not covert at all.

Auggie's character has some odd talents that a blind person wouldn't typically have, but I suppose the writers had to do something more with him.  Oh well...I guess that's their job.

In season 3 they stop with the episode wrap up all clean and pretty. She finally picks up a gun too. So frustrating that in every danger situation, there are loaded guns laying on the ground, and she decides to go to hand to hand combat. Still made for TV plot lines. Still mediocre writing.

4475272,1,B004UXVEUS,"Completely Liberal Obama Dictatorship Propaganda style show. An example of a failed part of American history we hope never to see again.
  CIA Agent hates guns, never uses them.
  Love interests are mostly Middle Eastern (sex scene  is where we quit watching)
  Her boss is a Tranny married to her other gay boss.
  Lots of transexual extras in background.
  Bashing Italy saying they are chovanistic pigs who don't let women drive? Seriously?

 Aside from that, the main character lacks the beauty, charisma, and style of Aliases main actress. She's also flat chested and they are shy showing her butt or sexy side.

 I don't care what people do in their privet lives, but I have had enough of tolerance for something that ruins The content you are trying to enjoy but Thrusting their junk at you every chance they get in an effort to change the way I think. no thanks.",1483315200,,870,4.66887417218543

The writers manage to keep it fresh.  Also, whereas Season 1 titles were all titles of Led Zeppelin songs, Season 2 makes liberal use of REM song titles.

4476699,4,B004UXVEUS,I am slowly watching my way through the seasons and after seeing 1 and most of 2 I can say that these are enjoyable stories but I would called each episode I have seen as 'adventure/thriller lite' with the emphasis on the word lite. However I do like that so far Annie has not had to use a gun but rather her wits.,1472774400,,314,4.0

4476723,5,B004UXVEUS,This is a great series.  It's sophisticated and unpredictable and it really can keep you guessing.  I also appreciate that the story line is usually not absurdly abstract and hard to follow.  I wish Black List would get the hint.,1472774400,,229,4.675

4476822,5,B004UXVEUS,"If you like fast action, a good plot and average acting in the line of Bourne Identity et al then this is the TV series for you. Of course the heroine, Annie Walker played by Piper Perabo,  has to survive and win in order to appear in the next episode. Some good acting by the supporting cast such as Christopher Gorham who plays Auggie, the blind computer whizz kid and Ann Dudek, Annie Walker's sister. Good entertainment without taxing one's intellect too much. Not everyone's cup of tea, but it is mine.",1471392000,,507,4.510869565217392
4476823,3,B004UXVEUS,"It's pretty good.  You need to stick with it for a few episodes because the first couple aren't all that engaging.  Annie is an unlikely heroine whose novice errors work out okay just a little too often.  She's cute though, good hearted, and a great driver, and eventually you find yourself pulling for her and wanting to see the next episode.  But nowhere nearly as addictive as 24, Downton, Hell on Wheels, Justified, Walking Dead, etc",1471392000,,437,4.7105263157894735

4477082,3,B004UXVEUS,The fist season was a fun season as he show was trying to develop an identity.  It had enough intrigue to keep me interested and high hopes for the second season.  So I was a little disappointed as the show seemed to continue trying to find an identity.....at first.  As the season progressed the last 6 episodes showed that an identity was starting to develop.  Now I am hooked.  The show was becoming less of a feel good not too developed character show into a more serious drama with more defined characters!,1468886400,,511,4.510869565217392

Some of the scenarios seem a bit contrived, and the politics of relations between CIA and Congress are over-simplified.  But the heroine and her immediate colleagues ring true in an off-beat quirky sense, even if the motivations of her higher management remain murky and unrealistically complex.

Sometimes I watch 2 or 3 episodes because I so caught up with the action. There is an undercurrent running through for Annie Walker (CIA covert agent) and Augie who is blind due to his service in Afghanistan and  her closest friend at the bureau. He is no longer a field agent, but he always has her back when she is in danger. He has amazing digital spy equipment that monitors throughout the world and especially if Annie is involved. I know the CIA gets a bad rap sometimes, but they do some amazing stunts to get their agents out of harm's way.",1461110400,,654,4.317073170731708

4477732,4,B004UXVEUS,The sex does nothing for the stories.  I really like the series except for that.  Why can't it just be implied instead of so blatant?  It's so unnecessary.,1459209600,,155,4.464285714285714

4477734,4,B004UXVEUS,"We're enjoying this show--we're now on season 4--but it's becoming a bit predictable and is acquiring a soap-opera quality, though the characters are well-drawn and the acting is strong. The main character, Annie, is brave and resourceful but doesn't think things through, which is a bit frustrating.  My favorite character is Auggie, who is blind, clever, and funny, and who relieves the drama at times.  Their now (season 4) arch-enemy and nemesis, Henry Wilcox, is not only extremely irritating, as he should be, but rather unbelievable in his ability to thwart them.  We'll watch through season 5, after which it was cancelled, but probably won't re-watch it at a later date, despite the good suspense and mostly strong plot.",1459209600,,729,5.109243697478991

4477880,5,B004UXVEUS,"Great! Covert Affairs is great, packed with action, drama, suspense and mystery that keeps me intrigued, impressed and entertained with every show. The inside story of the CIA and operations performed with an outstanding cast, especially Piper and the rest of the team is my favorite and one of the best, if not the best, tv series.  Annie is my favorite character with some many impressive qualities, like fortitude, loyalty, tenacity, resourceful, smart, strong and more.  Piper's personality is so lovable and plays this character so well with tremendous talent, grace, poise and some of the same characteristics as Annie that make the Annie character real, personable, a great friend, teammate, ally and more.  Annie's tremendous intuition, ability to improvise and courage to overcome imminent threats, obstacles, challenges and villians effectively with intelligence is sometimes remarkably amazing leaving my intrigue always wanting more and looking forward to the next episode.

:)  I enjoy the music, too, from Apple Trees and Tangerines:  "" 'Can you save me' from this nothing I've become?  It's just something that I've done.  I never meant to cause you worry.  Don't you blame me for this nothing I've become.  It's just something that I've done.  I never meant to show you my mistakes.""

In 2011, Piper, the Golden-Girl, was, by far, the best Golden-Globe Nominee for ""Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series - Drama"".  I look forward to her award-winning performance in Covert Affairs for many years to come.",1456963200,,1536,5.195121951219512

4477899,4,B004UXVEUS,Good entertainment and good stories that keeps your attention until the end of the episode.  The soap opera running plots are not intrusive and just a side thought to keep in mind as a curiosity of the episodes that mostly stand on their own.  The main character strains credibility as a spy who wins almost all fights with big bad-guys.  It is thoughtfully played out with her mostly unarmed and relying on her brains and language abilities to cope in the dangerous situations the plots take her.  I find the series a reliable watch when I need to catch something that is a pleasure to watch but does not require concentration to stay with the story.  A three star is an OK watch for me and a five star is almost never given.  This is four star because I appreciate a series that leaves me feeling my time was a pleasurably spent and glad I experienced it.,1456617600,,857,4.426751592356688

4478013,4,B004UXVEUS,"This is not just a review of Season 2.  The series started out slowly but got more and more interesting as the episodes progressed.  In the beginning, maintaining the double-life as an agent ... keeping family ties ... was part of the ongoing plot.  As the series progressed, the family-tie aspect got phased out and more intrigue and action took its place.  A strong female lead and a disabled veteran are major characters (you don't see that every day) and it works.  Seasons 3 and 4 were the most riveting for me.  If you like spy stories, I highly recommend Covert Affairs.",1454544000,,577,4.607843137254902

4478048,4,B004UXVEUS,"Season 2 is much like season one, except that Annie Walker is not obsessed with her lost love but is moving on in her CIA career.

There are a number of interesting story lines which slowly develop though this season, but the individual episodes generally resort to the same general story with varying backdrops and characters.  Some kind of spy activity is attempted by Annie, something goes wrong or some surprising fact is discovered that leads to the dramatic shoot out/car chase/rescue where Annie (Or one of her associates) saves the day, then queue the closing credits.  They are usually fun, but not deep, and after a few episodes you will be able to write the dialog yourself.

Watch them one or two at a time, just don't try and watch the whole season in one setting.",1454198400,,777,4.649635036496351

4478178,5,B004UXVEUS,"Somehow I missed this romantic spy thriller series when it began way back in 2010.  Now I got to see it all at once!  This is a high-production value series with a believable, gifted female star (Piper Perabo), top shelf co-stars (Christopher Gorham, Kari Matchett, Peter Gallagher) and supporting actors, fast-paced action all over the globe--much of it on-locale--and high test writers.  You can't go wrong getting caught up with Annie Walker, new CIA-operative, and her unfolding introduction to, and maturation with, the challenges faced by the United States in the modern world.  On second and third viewing, the detail worked into all five seasons of episodes becomes even more satisfying.  My only regret is that the series was ended in early 2015.  Be aware that, although the episodes are mostly self-contained, there is enough continuity in story lines which often bridge more than two episodes to warrant seeing these shows in series.  They are very effectively sequenced and paced--kudos to the directors.  Any possibilities for a movie spinoff?",1448582400,2,1057,5.21301775147929

If there is a question mark there about maybe ?? in the first season, you should watch the next. I found this to be true with Covert Affairs. Its funny how you can see todays history, if you will, play out in episodes that have been filmed earlier. I always look at these types of series in relationship to what is going on today in all aspects of life. You decide their lean. Yes, she does get out of and into circumstances pretty easy, but that is part of what makes it so enjoyable. I'm on Season 5 and at Season 3 it went up to 4 to 5 stars.

It also appears that she is the CIA's only unarmed covert operator which also seems a bit strange.,1446249600,,423,4.847222222222222

4478339,3,B004UXVEUS,There a too many places when you must suspend disbelief in this series. The fact that she never carries a gun but somehow never gets shot while all the other people around her do. The relationship with the sister and family. Her cover at the Smithsonian is used conveniently when it's needed. I know it's a lighter show but they could make an attempt to be more realistic in some areas. It's not enough to make me not watch it though.,1445558400,,434,4.37037037037037

4478364,5,B004UXVEUS,"We enjoy the fact that the ""culprits"" are different per-season. We do find some of the story lines a bit far fetched: Such as Wilcox being able to place anyone into the CIA- Lets face it if the SPY network can't uncover their own in-house spys/aka moles then why do we have the CIA again? . It would be cool to have the FBI and CIA team up in covert ""exercises"" aka contests in order to see who wins the SPY SUPERBOWL. Having none of the 'exercises' supposedly be real, but highly believable, perhaps allowing the audience to wonder if that was real or just a contest.  You know have a healthy-bragging rights at least. Would love to see Joan and Arthur be more of the 'creative married couple'. Fun-loving spy couple who everyone once and a while ""DO"" a covert operation together just so they don't get rusty and freshen up their roots.  Nice to find Auggie and Annie, (The A-team) getting together. Would enjoy seeing them secretly get-hitched. Again leaving the audience wondering if it really happened- you know, was the paperwork actually filed!  Might even be cool for him to have a short-term time of being able to see. Turning a blind-eye into a visual moment for both of them, before it fades away.... and den...= )  So far, so good.",1444867200,,1242,4.53125

4478481,5,B004UXVEUS,"Season 2 was better than season one. Finally, the story is being unfolded as she is now in the CIA. Each episode has their own inner plot and mission, which is great, but it also ties in the whole season into each episode as well. Good actors and actresses make it a surreal experience watching the show. I like that there aren't a lot of cussing but there is their fair share of naked bodies. Not to big an issue as the nude scenes are short and keeps the show ""real""....I wasn't intending to watch a porno so this is acceptable.

There are some very ""hot"" scenes but nothing too long or it doesn't last that long, which is a good thing. I didn't want to watch porno.

The show is growing quite well, they've got Annie on a very well considered giant story arc as she matures into her position as a spy. And the storytelling is getting better all the time. My one complaint for Season One was that nothing about the show was ""magical,"" but I've come to think that measure was a poor one for me to use. No one episode perhaps stands out (unlike, say, other favorites like Burn Notice and Leverage), but this series really seems to be taking the long view, and should be judged accordingly.

As a big fan of Alias, I like Covert Affairs and think it is equal to Alias because it does have a different perspective... but the fight scenes in Covert affairs are a bit lame and sometimes I find myself asking ""wait how did they get to this scene from there"" like there is something missing in the editing that doesn't makes sense or seem realistic.

However - more realistic scenes are needed; instead of these imaginary ones where an unarmed small female agent is unrealistically pitted against trained armed killers - oh no worry...... Piper will kick there ass - all 130 lbs of her always smashing large trained killers - get real - again I say give her a gun.

It is an enjoyable show and it shows the struggles with having to lead two lives, the deception with doing that, and the outcome. I also like the use of a blind man, Auggi, to show that a disabled person has worth in a job not usually manned with with someone with no sight.

4478943,5,B004UXVEUS,Great story line.  Exciting but they didn't over do the sex and death scenes like so many shows do now. The story was good enough that the shock factor was not required. Great for a working mom who likes a good girl power 007 type show to watch. They even ended it well instead of in a deep dark mess like shows tend to do now.  So well done and refreshing not to walk away sick to your stomach with a graphic scene seared into your memory. Wish we had more like these. I was able to watch it without waiting for nap time or bed time for my little one.  Sooo rare for a good adult themed story line these days. Bravo to the makers of this one.,1437436800,,643,3.9689922480620154

Mostly because the main agent doesn't know how to fight nor fire a weapon, which begs the question, ""How is this an agent of any type"". secondly the Laser light that the blind guy uses instead of a walking stick is a toy that one of my teenagers had, so C'MON, Really????.

And, she does, in remarkable ways, but with each assignment we see her dip into the dark side of ops and how it changes her. Piper Perabo does an excellent job in showing the conflicts ""Annie"" faces as she treads the path the CIA sets her on. The supporting characters continue to be an excellent foil for ""Annie's"" rapid development as a top operative - the stories are well written, well acted, and seem real. Piper's ability to run in those ankle busting high heels continues to amaze me!",1428883200,,616,4.609090909090909

4479306,4,B004UXVEUS,"If it weren't for the USA Network, I wouldnt have nearly as much TV to watch.  (I don't know if thats a good thing or a bad thing.)  While I love most of their shows, not every one is a winner.  Once such show is Covert Affairs.  The just finished season two was certainly entertaining, although it wasn't grab you exciting.

The show revolves around Annie Walker (Piper Perabo), a new agent at the CIA.  Shes beginning to get the hang of life as a spy, trying to balance that with her sister Danielle (Anne Dudek) who doesnt know what she does.  But the show really focuses on work, where Annie reports to Joan (Kari Matchett) whose husband Arthur (Peter Gallagher) is a director in the CIA.  Her co-worker Jai (Sendhil Ramamurthy) is very focused on climbing the ranks, while Auggie (Christopher Gormen) is content to stay in support but only because his blindness keeps them from going back out in the field.

The budget must have really been increased for this season because the show finds Annie traveling to more exotic locations, and some of these episodes were filmed on location.  She is sent to Paris to cultivate a new asset and flies to Berlin to help Peter with a former asset who happens to be his former girlfriend.  Closer  to home, Annie goes back to training to find out who is leaking new recruits names and starts surveillance on two brothers who might be part of a terrorist plot against the Spanish government.

Over the course of the season, Auggie gets a promotion and meets again the man responsible for his blindness, Jai learns the identity of the CIAs leak to the media and gets a promotion, and Danielle gets closer to learning what Annie really does.

Like manyUSANetwork shows, each episodes features a plot of the week as well as a few ongoing storylines.  On most of the shows, I get hooked on those stories and find the episodes of the week engrossing.  Here, I find the episode of the week diverting and the ongoing stories interesting but not must watch compelling.

So by now you're probably wondering why I keep watching the show.  Heres the reason.  I enjoy the show when its on.  It's just that I don't find myself thinking about it between episodes.  Its pleasant and fun but not absolutely must watch.

I think part of that is the fact that many of the characters are weak.  Joan and Peter especially have never been very well developed.  Dont get me started on Danielle, who is stuck with the thankless sub-plots that are just intended to flesh out Annies character.  Jai fairs a little better, but even he is pretty flat.  The weaker characters make it harder to care about on going stories.

Thankfully, Annie and Auggie are very well developed and interesting characters.  Maybe thats why Im fully invested in seeing these two come together eventually.  They have a great relationship and what appears to be a genuine friendship.

Now Im not going to fault any of the actors for the lack of character development.  When they are given something meaty to do, they tackle it with gusto and really make us believe the moments.  I find the entire cast believable every week, which is another reason I keep watching.

The show is a bit more story driven than character driven.  I always find the story of the week interesting.  Annie may not always make the best choices, but she is resourceful enough to get out of any danger she gets herself into.  They may not be edge of your seat, but they are compelling enough to keep me coming back.  Between the story of the week and Annie and Auggie, I definitely do enjoy the show while it's airing.

Season two consisted of sixteen episodes, and they are collected here on four DVD's in widescreen and full surround.  The set includes deleted and alternative scenes plus a gag reel.  There's also a featurette on filming the episodes that were filmed on location.

While not my favorite show on the USA Network, Covert Affairs is still fun and worth watching.  Season two held my interest.",1428796800,,3975,4.611982881597718

4479327,2,B004UXVEUS,"I was disappointed with this show.  I was expecting a strong heroin and instead was forced to watch the most incompetent spy to ever lead a series.  As a fan of this genre, I expected a strong lead female character in the vein of  La Femme Nikita, Nikita, Alias, even Dollhouse, but found myself watching a character who goes out of her way to suck at her job, get caught, and be rescued EVERY SINGLE EPISODE!  She consistently breaks her cover or is discovered while keeping secrets from her friends and family (the people who she should trust and confide in) while divulging national secrets to complete strangers in an effort to ""win their trust"", or some BS like that.  The show is thoroughly unbelievable even as fantasy, and the main character, Annie Walker, is a complete disaster.
  Don't get me wrong though, the actors were great and do a phenomenal job portraying their characters, but the writers should have been replaced after season 1.  They decided to create a character who was a SPY who can't lie, falls in love with EVERY asset she encounters, has the hand-to-hand skills of a 4 year old (she literally gets beat up every episode), and the trade-craft of Johnny English.  I dredged through the series in hopes to find that her character grew, but instead she just got worse every episode, to the point that I could anticipate the plot after the first 10 minutes of the episode. Here it goes...
SPOILER: An event happens, she gets briefed, the seasoned professionals come up with a plan, but she comes up with an unorthodox way to accomplish it, they ""give her a chance"".  She meets an asset.  She finds the ""good"" in the asset, causing her to compromise the mission and fail.  The Seasoned Professionals come up with a contingency plan, or decide to scrub the mission.  She disagrees, goes off book and tries to finish the mission anyway.  This fails, she has to be broken out of jail or rescued by a blind guy or a deus-ex-machina old acquaintance.  The asset is saved and she goes back to work, praised for her cunning, ""instinct"", and stick-to-it attitude.  Wash, rinse, repeat...  Take my word for it, EVERY EPISODE is exactly like this.  I dare anyone to find a single episode that isn't.
  Ultimately, I felt like I lost several hours of my life and should have spent the time finally watching Breaking Bad or at least re-watching Nikita or Fringe.  If you can manage through the first season, then this is for you, but if you are annoyed by the end, trust me, it just get exponentially worse as it continues.  So sad.",1428192000,,2543,4.604444444444445

4479462,5,B004UXVEUS,Covert Affairs season 2 just got better and better.  It is now one of my favorite shows to stream with Amazon's Prime.  I think Piper Perbo is the added dinomite of this series.  I didn't know who she was prior to her staring in this series.  She does it all....rough and tumble and knows her enemies and  own's her charm.  I enjoy all the different countries this series films in.  This series is always full of excitement with it's many twists and turns.  There is some great character acting....who would have even thought a blind agent would be the man with computer savey and  so charming to boot .  This is only one reason to tune into Covert Affairs.  It placed the challenge of being blind and gave it a wonderful character that is so intelligent and incredibly resourceful.  I really enjoy Covert Affairs and I think you will too.,1425081600,,839,4.52

As such, this show has become a regular goto on so-so nights of light entertainment...and it's available on streaming through Amazon Prime.

4479507,4,B004UXVEUS,"This is a series that follows a CIA dectective's cases across the globe. It has a strong female lead. The episodes are shot all over the world, so you get to vicariously visit a ton of places. If you enjoyed Chuck and White Collar, you will definitely like this show.
The only con is that after a point, the show gets consumed in itself and the overarching storyline that focuses on Henry Wilcox, as the protagonist, gets quite ridiculous.",1424390400,,439,4.569620253164557

4479706,5,B004UXVEUS,"I've been watching this on my Prime account. Season 1 was a little choppy. The writers hadn't seemed to quite decide what they wanted to do with the show. It was OK, but the characters hadn't found their voice, yet. Season 2 has the consistency of a great show. The characters had matured into complete individuals. I'm a spy story junkie. There's enough of that to keep me happy. At the same time, there's a lot about how the characters interact. And that doesn't detract at all from the spying aspect of the show. It's not all guns and explosions, but there's enough excitement to keep most of us happy.",1416355200,,605,4.509090909090909
4479707,2,B004UXVEUS,"Tawdry at best with a sad attempt to humanize spies while making the protagonist who uses her blonde hair and dumb luck to get complete her missions.
Here is everything wrong with the show
1. Her language skills are some how achieved through both exotic travels as well as a high brow education which leaves me wondering where does a military brat get the money to get an Ivy league masters level education and to travel the world aimlessly. Not saying that military families don't get an education or some type of government aid for that education but her whole life story seems far-fetched. What has she done for money the rest of her adult life?
2. The only reason Annie is living with her sister is to add the sense of danger that some bad guys will find out she is CIA and kidnap her family. If she really is some impressive Smithsonian employee like her cover story claims, why is she still living with her family?
3. Since when does a three week beach romp count as a serious relationship? Ben's disappearance in the middle of life saved both Ben and Annie's life, you think she would get over it and cut him some slack.
4. Not that I don't think blind people are capable but Aussi seems like a guy who trying to act like he is blind not like someone who is actually blind. If that is some plot twist in the future, I'm not sticking around to see it.",1416268800,,1357,4.346456692913386

4479804,2,B004UXVEUS,"This show has a great first three seasons. The actress who plays Annie, Piper Perabo, has that Julia Roberts smile and a bit of Roberts' mystique. The show includes good plots, good acting, beautiful photography and locations.
As other have mentioned, yes, the plots are a bit predictable -- superior tells Annie not to do something, and she does it anyway, and it all winds up well.
There are a number of inconsistencies with reality.
Would the CIA really pull a trainee from The Farm because they did not have anyone else who was an attractive female agent who could speak Russian? I can see it if they needed an agent who could speak Xhosa.
Why would Annie, who drives a cheaper car and lodges with her sister and brother-in-law, have a huge collection of $700 Louboutin red-sole shoes -- not to mention that very high-heeled shoes are hardly professional or practical for the foot chases she is guaranteed to get in every episode? Especially later, locations are shot up and there are spectacular car chases and crashes, but the police rarely get involved. Every male agent Annie deals with could be a male model, and she falls almost-into and out-of romances quickly. In the first season, the CIA seems to require women to wear low-neckline dresses, but these get more realistic later. The sex scenes are all identical -- soft light, music, Annie's bare shoulder and perhaps her bra. Very predictable. Would a high-ranking CIA officer such as Joan go around as a blonde with black roots? In one hospital resuscitation scene, the patient has flat-lined but still has a 110/70 blood pressure, plus of course the patient is shocked back into consciousness -- flat-lined patients are not shocked!
It's also quite senseless that Annie would never use any type of disguise, and that she would tell almost everyone her real name.
The first few seasons there are a set of books behind Arthur's desk -- as the head of a department within the CIA, why would Arthur need a dozen volumes of annotated California statutes (the dark blue books) in his office? The khaki colored books are legal case books -- appropriate for a law office library, not to a CIA director.
And a blind man having the job as the lead tech -- which includes analyzing photos in some episodes? Impossible that the CIA would use someone whose lack of sight would slow him down or make him delegate some tasks to others. Auggie could be a trainer, a mentor, an advisor, but not head tech/ sometime field operative.
And really -- a foreign source is told to meet his CIA contact (Annie), but he is only told to meet ""an American blonde who will accept your invitation to coffee,"" with no sign/countersign -- not to mention that he carries that description with him on a typed sheet on the way to the meeting? No way that could go wrong. (Yes, of course it goes wrong and the wrong contact meets the wrong blonde.)
As then, as the series goes on, heading into Seasons 4 and 5, the show ""jumps the shark"" with byzantine plot devices. Henry turns into a sinister all-knowing string-pulling Professor Moriarty / Mycroft character. Former spouses and children of characters, and faked deaths, never mentioned before, start popping up. Agents go ""rogue"" or ""dark"" left and right, working their own, or someone else's, secret agendas. The first three seasons are good, but pull the plug on the rest.",1412208000,,3356,4.7384615384615385

4479844,4,B004UXVEUS,"Given that Justified, Orange is the New Black, the Americans, and Breaking Bad are 5-star quality in my view, 4 stars is a good rating. The characters are solid for TV but not really 5-star memorable and the writing is above par for TV. The production values are excellent and the acting is good for a TV series. The stories are well developed up to the climax of each show, then they seem to wrap up too quickly. The back stories of the characters are well done and help sustain the show when the main plot is a little weaker than usual. I love the location shooting and the productions are excellent for tread mill watching. The Americans is a much better ""spy story"", but is also a darker work.

4479858,4,B004UXVEUS,I didn't think that I would have liked this show as much as I did but amazon instant video kept recommending it.  When I finally gave it a shot I really like it.  They have some really good story telling and you get really attached to the characters.  The stakes are always high and you get a real sense of that from the acting. There is also some comedic elements and smart dialog. The graphics are getting better (it seems they were on a budget in season 1).

If it wasn't for the ensemble cast (although Piper Perabo seems to be the main 'attraction') I couldn't watch due to Perabo's lack of acting skills. The following may contain SPOILERS: It was nice when Auggie and Annie finally got together but it was ruined when Auggie slept with Helen--where was this love this he supposedly had for Annie? By the end of Season 4 Annie looked and acted hard. While this is a show, it would be nice if they made it more real. Annie never tries to disguise herself (she never even changes her name!) until she goes 'dark' at the end of Season 4.

4479957,4,B004UXVEUS,"Season 1 left me entertained but with some areas definitely lacking.  Season 2 steps up overall as the character Annie does as well.  Season 1 treated many topics with a little to much ""fluff"" and leaving the impression that the main character while successful in her job was more lucky than good.  Season 2 gives us a more mature agent to watch which I guess plays in step with the storyline as she is no longer fresh out of ""the farm"" and now has some experience to draw on and demonstrated enough that her superiors and peers have more confidence in her.  Some of the blatant issues with the storyline were addressed head on making Annie's personal life more believable and then some were swept away (like her sister suddenly becoming a single mom without addressing where her brother in law went).  Overall the season took the show a step in the right direction and I can see consistency in how the characters are working out life vs. the secrecy around their job just as Annie works out or on some of the bigger life issues that in the first season left her looking more like a kid in a grown up world.  But in retrospect Season 1 was about her being pulled from the farm early and being thrown into live CIA work and being successful in spite of not ""graduating"" and her intuition being good relative to her work.  I simply had to see Season 2 and see the story develop to know that the character was going to mature and the show not continue to focus on her being a newbie.  I'm sticking with 4 out of 5 as the show has improved it simply  hasn't taken me to the place of considering it excellent as apposed to good.  I still summarize it as entertaining and worth watching, but 5 stars are for those shows that years after they are gone I still wish I could watch.  Given this isn't one of my favorite genre's actually says a lot about the show in and of itself as there aren't a lot that I even watch so I may be judging it more harshly because I don't look for as many shows in this category to fill my time, I tend more towards books in this genre, which may be why I'm looking for more detail than is provided.  But I have at least 3 more seasons to make that final determination, for now seasons 1 and 2 are good entertainment I give a 4 out of 5 and am enjoying.",1408233600,,2276,4.23094688221709

It seems like the main character is winding down, also. I guess she is addicted to the excitement of living on the edge. It seems to be to the exclusion of fulfilment in other areas of her life.

4480157,4,B004UXVEUS,"Coming from a fan of 24 and ALIAS (only one of which has recently made a come back) I enjoy this show. Obviously, the genre is my favorite. There are some pretty awful blue screen shots that I find noticeable, but most people either won't notice or simply breeze by it. I love the content of the show, the witty banter and camaraderie between Annie Walker and Auggie Anderson, and even appreciate the relationship between Annie's superiors, Joan and Arthur. I hate the ""intro"" to the show, something like this is appropriate for a show like Chuck, but not a spy series like Covert Affairs. I feel like it's cheesy and sets the wrong mood for the content of what you're about to watch. That being said, it's kept me interested enough to keep watching and look forward to the next episode! I give it a four star rating, doesn't touch ALIAS or 24, but it's addictive and interesting enough to earn a good rating, and I appreciate how much the actors and writers put into the effort. Now if someone could get them better music, a new intro, and more professional special effects, this show would be perfect!",1404259200,,1103,4.547738693467337

4480176,3,B004UXVEUS,"I started watching this show when it first aired.  It is very light.  The acting is fine, not great.  Each show has it's own plot.  There is a weak running plot through the show.  The premise for the show is plausible.  It's by no means the best spy show I've ever watched, but is great when I want to watch something mindless.",1403740800,,327,4.193548387096774
4480177,5,B004UXVEUS,I love this show.  I can'wait for the new season.  It is very exciting and makes me wish I had done something else with my life.  Piper Perabo is the perfect person to play this part.  I love Auggie.,1403568000,,199,4.0256410256410255
4480178,5,B004UXVEUS,Great talents in front and behind the screen.  The writer has not repeated a story in two seasons and continues to surprise me.  Language and sex content PG,1403568000,,156,4.535714285714286
4480179,5,B004UXVEUS,"I look forward to watching this series for a nice break in the middle of a busy day.  I have always loved the ""spy"" genre, including James Bond, Mission Impossible, I Spy, etc. A  Covert Affairs episode is like a little slice of that genre, a mini spy thriller.  I am only now in the 2nd season, so I keep wondering when and if Annie will ever get a gun, but I love the way she uses her wits to survive seemingly impossible odds.

Another thing that I love about the series is that the protagonist is a strong female character, while remaining feminine.  I have always enjoyed series with strong female characters (Dark Angel, Wonder Woman, La Femme Nikita, etc.), perhaps because I have often wished that my abused mother had been stronger.

So this series has the drama, the mystery, the strong female character, the exotic locations, the sexiness of a bond thriller, and even a few gadgets.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys those elements.  I am happy to have discovered this series.",1403568000,,990,4.553672316384181
4480180,5,B004UXVEUS,I was surprise that this show is entertainingly mysterious  and funny. I also enjoy seeing new talent appear on the television scene.,1403481600,,133,5.045454545454546

4480182,5,B004UXVEUS,The show is very entertaining.  It is a fast-paced CIA mystery with plenty of twists.  The characters are all very likeable.  Highly recommend it!,1403481600,,146,5.0
4480183,5,B004UXVEUS,"Lots of variety in this season.  Glad they put the Ben storyline to rest.  Chemistry between Annie and Eyal is building and made this season a great one.  (What can I say, I love Oded Fehr!)",1403481600,,190,4.222222222222222
4480184,5,B004UXVEUS,"I love this show! This is the season in which Annie reveals to her sister that she works for the CIA. In my opinion, seasons 1 & 2 were the best. Annie still had a more vulnerable side. Of course, characters must evolve & change. The show is always action packed! I love the friendship between Annie & Auggie! If you like shows with a strong but vulnerable female lead, then this is a great one!",1403481600,,395,4.2105263157894735

4480186,4,B004UXVEUS,"A fun watch.  Not exactly a Jason Bourne thriller, not completely believable plot elements, but one of the most entertaining spy series.  Humour, suspense, enough action, and some character development.

I am only into the 2d season, and I am hoping that Annie will lose her deer-in-the-headlights look as she becomes more experienced and more self-confident.",1403395200,,359,5.375
4480187,5,B004UXVEUS,"Piper is excellent in her roll as Annie Walker.  The stories are interesting and the locations are often very beautiful.  Really, really love this series. . .I wish they would keep filming it.",1403308800,,192,4.787878787878788
4480188,4,B004UXVEUS,Kept the interest over the entire season. Thanks for Amazon Prime. Varied enough to continue watching through. Enjoy the experience.,1403308800,,132,5.65
4480189,5,B004UXVEUS,This is another film with a female hero.  She is vunerable and tough and very focused. This film has more than enough beautiful men. A real twist is a blind veteran who is very intelligent and gets around almost too well to be believed.  It is full of twists and usually ends each segment with you dying to see what happens next.,1403308800,,329,4.290322580645161

4480192,5,B004UXVEUS,"I saw two episodes of Covert Affairs on a flight back from L.A. so when I saw it on my Amazon Prime, I started watching season 1.  That was two weeks ago and I've been ""binge-ing"" on this ever since!  Each show is more or less the same. Spy goes on mission; suspense builds; action scene, resolution.  Nonetheless, I find it entertaining and I'm more interested in the ongoing story lines that are woven throughout the entire show.",1403222400,,431,4.5
4480193,5,B004UXVEUS,"This is one of my favorite shows & I am thrilled to own it now!!  The characters lead a very stressful life dealing with their jobs, family, and the overlapping they sometimes have to deal with.  Very real personalities & subject matter, even for those of us not in the CIA!  :)

I highly recommend this show!",1403136000,,309,4.368421052631579

4480198,3,B004UXVEUS,I think it has been amateurish. Too much social time takes up time that could be used for intrigue and action.,1403049600,,110,4.285714285714286

4480202,5,B004UXVEUS,"I wanted to start a new series and this was the one! The producers/writers take the time to introduce the characters so that the viewer has an opportunity to develop attachments so that you care or not if they live or die!

4480210,5,B004UXVEUS,I had never heard of it before I saw it on Amazon.  I have been binge watching it and am totally hooked.  I love seeing all the great places she travels.  I am sure it must make real CIA agents cringe but it is very entertaining to watch.  She really gets herself in some messes.,1402444800,,279,4.0181818181818185
4480211,4,B004UXVEUS,This was a good season.  We liked it better before Henry became the focus of the series.  Augie and Annie are heating up.,1402444800,,121,4.217391304347826

light side.",1402185600,,253,4.291666666666667

4480221,5,B004UXVEUS,"This series is one of the best that I have seen in a long time. The cast was right on and made this a must see on a regular basis.  Piper Perabo has definitely gotten her craft down and has shown good depth and breadth as far as the writing allowed, and it had great promise.

Lose the adolescent view of the ""hookup"" mentality that poorly substitutes for real relationships and this excellent group of actors could have made a real gem out of this story line. Writers shouldn't stay in the shallow ""pee pee caca"" show yours and I'll show mine micro thin waste of time if they really are out for more than cheap money. anyone can make money...but this cast could have done real art.",1402099200,,682,4.3203125

Having said that, I really enjoy watching it - it's light and entertaining and sometimes the plot is a surprising.  If you like Castle or if you liked Chuck, Covert Affairs is along the same line.  Annie has more hutzpah than she lets on, and Auggie is a great character.  Enjoy watching!",1401753600,,401,4.293333333333333

It kept me glued to the screen (of my Kindle) and roped me in for seasons yet to come.  It's a great show.  The characters are more complex and the relationships intertwine,and grow, and of course, Piper Perabo is perfect for this role. And Hill Harper?  (swoon)  Let's see them become ""friends"". World travels, red bottom shoes, great clothes, beautiful people, big guns, action and intrigue galore. When do we get to see Season 5?  I'm watching all the seasons over again.

4480254,3,B004UXVEUS,"As noted shallow plot, thankfully populated by many very beautiful and quite resourceful ladies. Ms Perabo is a highly talented, sensuous and versatile actress. The supporting cast does a credible and often enjoyable job. I would recommend it to anyone recognizing it is a light, easily digestible show",1400544000,,302,5.3125
4480255,3,B004UXVEUS,"Plots, though entertaining, are repetitious.  The lead actress has the whole range of acting ability from A to B.  I watched it because it was free and because I am  housebound.",1400544000,,177,4.645161290322581

4480259,5,B004UXVEUS,We enjoy the characters in this show and think it is well cast.  It has the humorous banter between main characters that we like.,1400284800,,129,4.375
4480260,5,B004UXVEUS,A cute show with just enough action and comedy. The characters are likable and draw you in making you root for the good guys.,1400025600,,125,4.25
4480261,4,B004UXVEUS,"CIA procedural featuring exotic locations, a strong and capable heroine, superb male eye candy, ripped-from-the-headlines-storylines, appealing and well-drawn characters of both sexes, and a lot of action sequences in wholly inappropriate but exquisite shoes.",1399852800,,259,6.647058823529412

4480267,4,B004UXVEUS,I think this show gets better each year.  I respect the P Perabo for daring to look worn and beaten and un-made up - in other words she looks the part as required.  No huge ego here.  I don't like that she and Auggie became lovers - they were so good as friends.  And I miss Eyal,1399334400,,279,3.8421052631578947

4480271,5,B004UXVEUS,"I have not always been a big fan of Piper. I enjoyed her in Coyote Ugly but hadn't followed her career before and after that movie. I started watching the show because of the storyline/plot line. Nearly any CIA-, FBI-, MI5-, or MI6-related show will catch my attention, in fact. But it was 100% Piper that maintained my interest. I loved the first season, hooked nearly immediately, and have been impressed with the writers' and actors' growth and development over the seasons. It truly just gets better and better. I cannot wait for seasons 4 & 5 to be available on Amazon Prime (I don't have cable - like most Americans today). Bring it on Amazon!! Get to it!!!",1399161600,,663,4.579831932773109
4480272,5,B004UXVEUS,Annie's adventures as a CIA agent continue in season 2 of Covert Affairs. I enjoy watching her escapades and discovering how she manages to juggle the double life of living with her sister and being a covert operative.,1399161600,,218,4.7631578947368425

4480274,5,B004UXVEUS,"This is an engaging series with top notch performances. As the series has progressed, the characters' moral fiber becomes more and more apparent, making them either villains or heroes, and at the same time, they are human, so that empathy is not lost. Whether this was by design or not, it is the very thing that some of us as Americans are struggling with, the apparent lack of accountability of the CIA to the observing American people and even more recently to Congress itself.  We need the CIA, but we also need integrity and accountability. It would be more acceptable if everyone in the CIA and their actions were as attractive as the characters in this series, and if all actions were as noble. But at any rate, the show gives us a perception of a kinder and gentler agency, which we can live with. I rated the series, which I hope does not in any way rate the actual CIA! I would highly recommend Covert Affairs!",1399075200,,920,4.508982035928144

4480276,3,B004UXVEUS,"Covert Affairs appears to be a mixed attempt at a spy thriller and ""Chuck""...it comes complete with a sister and interoffice politics. The story-line is uneven....It even tried to be a LITTLE racy. Anything to entice viewers....",1398902400,,228,5.1891891891891895

4480340,4,B004UXVEUS,"Covert Affairs is non-stop action with interesting caricatures and intense interplays of relationships.
I chose this series because I loved Alias with Jennifer Garner but I thought some of the actors in Alias were over played.  In Covert Affairs it seems to me that there is a right balance between Annie Walker (Piper Perabo) and her assignments, lovers and support personnel.  I want to watch every episode of every season...yes it is that good!  Action, intrigue and drama par excellence!  So what if borrows some of the plot patterns and traits of Alias and 24 it is still in a league of its own.  Watch it and you will see what I mean!",1395705600,,640,4.628318584070796
4480341,4,B004UXVEUS,"This is an enjoyable show, not always plausible but fun to watch if you are not too critical of reality.  There are interesting missions these agents engage in and the show keeps me engaged.  Addicted!",1395705600,,201,4.714285714285714
4480342,5,B004UXVEUS,"The action is never serious enough to be diconcerting and the byplay between the main characters is warm and fuzzy.  Unspoken yearnings and love between agents adds to the pleasure of watching this upbeat, techno comedy thriller.",1395705600,,229,5.1891891891891895
4480343,5,B004UXVEUS,"This series is addictive!  Sure, some things are a bit far fetched, but ... it's TV!  Fantasy land.
I love the characters, and it always leaves the viewer in suspense ... dying to know what is going to happen next.
LOVE IT!",1395705600,,223,4.285714285714286

Hope Prime continued to offer additional seasons. I'm hooked!",1395705600,,180,6.24
4480345,3,B004UXVEUS,"I already rated this show, and my ideas haven't changed. We watch it because of the character development and likeable actors, but the main character, Annie Walker, seems to have more than a normal share of adventure/danger than most real agents might face. The most recent episode used a statistic that the CIA lost only 103 operatives over the past 65 years, as compared to the hundreds of thousands of lives lost in the armed services and tens of thousands of police across the country. This leads us to believe that a CIA agent's work is not quite what Annie experiences on a regular basis. Nevertheless, the show is good entertainment with interesting plots.",1395705600,,663,4.824561403508772

4480348,5,B004UXVEUS,Annie's story keeps me glued to every episode. My favorite guest star is Oded Fehr playing Eyal Lavine and let's not forget Auggie. I love the role he plays as a blind tech op head of his own division.,1395705600,,201,4.17948717948718
4480349,5,B004UXVEUS,"Well kudos to the writers of Covert Affairs.  I saw Piper Perabo and I thought, nah, she cant pull this off, well I was dead wrong.  From the the two married leaders and their troubled marriage and working relationship, to Jai, son of the ex head of covert ops, playing the game like a pro, to the developing relationship between Annie and Augie, the blind, brilliant, and crazy sexy, tech ops specialist.  Not since Chuck have I had such a nerd crush.  I cant wait until the romance launches, but until then, I savor all the lead ups, the venues, the tech stuff, go see the youtube video, on Covert Affairs, Annie and Augie, Here with You, it's hauntingly beautiful.",1395619200,,667,4.533333333333333

4480353,5,B004UXVEUS,I love covert affairs.  Not only since Fiona from Burn Notice have I seen I woman that is smart and cunning as her.  Plus Piper has a sweet nature that really fools the bad guys.  It does not hurt that there are two extremely hot guys that go without shirts on the show also.  Great plot lines and acting.,1395360000,,305,4.11864406779661
4480354,5,B004UXVEUS,The characters continue to grow their relationships to each other and Annie's innovative working with others involved on the cases has unique turns that sometime startle in effectiveness as well as her skills.,1395360000,,209,5.363636363636363
4480355,5,B004UXVEUS,Can hardly stop watching it each night. Piper plays her part superbly. It's a lot of fun and you feel like you're getting a look at what goes on inside the intel agencies.,1395273600,,171,4.212121212121212
4480356,4,B004UXVEUS,It's getting better with each episode and may soon be as good as Alias. I believe it will make the grade(I'm a RETIRED TEACHER),1395273600,,127,4.333333333333333

4480359,4,B004UXVEUS,Season two continues with the same delightful characters.  In this season we learn more about the characters' private life away from the agency. The episodes become more exciting toward the second half of the season. Basically it's a feel good show. If you like light hearted spy stories add a star.  If you like intense thrillers subtract a star. I found it enjoyable.,1395273600,,369,4.841269841269841
4480360,5,B004UXVEUS,Annie Walker's character is so physical. . .great stunts! I love action movies and these are awesome. Agie is a great actor also. He is working his role! Very popular with the ladies.,1395273600,,183,4.575757575757576

4480362,5,B004UXVEUS,"Still love the series! This season's episodes look like the actors have gotten their groove and chemistries and how they play off against one another better than in season 1 where they looked tense interacting with each other.  Might be the fact they were renewed another year that made them chill-ax this season, and it shows and is obvious in the way the characters play off against each other. Looking forward to season 3 and catching up with season 4.",1395187200,,455,4.6875

4480369,5,B004UXVEUS,"He reviewed the blind character and saw that the actor preferred less awkward sex/intimacy scenes.  He really liked this.  He also liked the fact that he does not have to filter language; many current shows have language that young people cannot use at school or work.  He likes the pace.  An academically aggressive young person, he likes the snappy dialogue and diverse settings.  He also likes the ""lightness"" of the program.  He does not want to have to invest extensive emotional baggage because he has enough pressure with school and work.  He likes it.",1394755200,,559,4.882978723404255

4480373,5,B004UXVEUS,This show is so spectuclar it keeps you guessing for more and more.  I don't ever want it to end.,1394582400,,97,3.85

4480375,4,B004UXVEUS,"Pick out any show out of order and you will find it relatively easy to make sense of it. Each presentation is a completion of itself. There is teasing relationships, bad guys, good guys and perhaps good girls, but that is not what we come to look for.",1394582400,,251,4.25

4480379,5,B004UXVEUS,I started watching this show as something to watch when working out.  I got hooked and ended up watching all seasons available.  Can't wait for the next season!,1394323200,,160,4.678571428571429
4480380,5,B004UXVEUS,The show is a little quirky but all in all its a great show. Piper & the blind guy make a great pair. I hate the opening music though.,1394323200,,134,3.6551724137931036

4480383,5,B004UXVEUS,I like the show.  I think it is very entertaining.  Good to watch on rainy days or any other day.,1394150400,,97,3.8
4480384,4,B004UXVEUS,"Piper Perabo makes a great spy.  She's beautiful, she's expressive, fun to watch.  The stories are fairly realistic for the most part.  The pace is pretty good.

Really, the only negative notes on the show are the apparent aversion the main character has to carrying a gun *when she needs to be carrying one* and that the fictional CIA does apparently not have access to all the tools and technology that the real CIA has access to.

I highly recommend the whole series.",1394064000,,470,4.614457831325301
4480385,4,B004UXVEUS,"So wonderful to see a spy series with a woman as the main character.
I also love the fact that the shows also incorporates a handicap person.",1394064000,,141,4.2592592592592595
4480386,5,B004UXVEUS,"I had seen the trailers for Covert Affairs, but never had the time to watch it while it was on. We found this on Prime and are now on Season 2. It is a different take on the CIA and quite enjoyable.",1394064000,,198,3.738095238095238
4480387,4,B004UXVEUS,"Perabo is great in this...the creators were able to create a show for all those with Alias withdrawals!  Good characters, good story, an escape from my banal existence.",1394064000,,168,5.0

4480389,3,B004UXVEUS,"I think my issue is still Piper Perabo. I hate to use the word, unrealistic to describe this show, but allowance for entertainment factor aside, her heightening subordination without recourse is a bit annoying. Needless to say I still follow it, hence three stars.",1394064000,,264,5.0227272727272725
4480390,4,B004UXVEUS,"Season two continues by revealing more about the main characters, which enriches the storyline. Having secondary characters return to help with cases is always a plus, too. Guest appearances by great actors adds extra intrigue. Very enjoyable series.",1394064000,,250,5.605263157894737

4480392,5,B004UXVEUS,"I very much enjoy this show. It's smart, and sometimes funny, and just enough excitement. I started watching because Piper was in it. I've kept watching because its good! I think it'll be a sad day when I catch up on all the back episodes.",1393891200,,239,4.333333333333333
4480393,3,B004UXVEUS,It is becoming more believable. Good job developing several main characters and their back stories and current devoting roles.  Glad it is part of Amazon prime or I might have not given it a chance.,1393891200,,198,4.6571428571428575

Annie and her sister are split over Annie's mysterious comings and goings. Field Ops become deadly. The action builds with each episode with Annie losing someone safe and secure with almost each episode. Finally she is left with only herself to rely on in the field and at Langley, where Joan seems hostile and Augie seems preoccupied.",1393804800,,480,5.0886075949367084

4480400,5,B004UXVEUS,"This show took me completely by surprise. It is excellent in every aspect: writing, directing, casting & acting, & even the music throughout is very well-chosen and well done. The storylines are exciting & packed with action and suspense and, at the same time, the development of the characters is just brilliant, very in-depth & extremely well-acted and well-played out. You really get to know the main characters and fall in love with them, both individually & them together. I also love the humor, which is very entertaining. Just the right amount & at the right times. Yet, as the seasons progress, the show is taken up a notch and becomes a lot more serious and still never ever ceases to amaze me. This show is incredible and the actors are incredible and I hope it keeps going for many seasons! There are several shows that I like a lot, but this is one of my all-time favorites so far.

4480406,5,B004UXVEUS,I'm fascinated with the Show's ability to provide a somewhat fictional behind the curtain look into the world of the CIA and its involvement with other countries' covert intelligence services. The action is riveting and Piper Perabo is innocently adorable as an operative who appears to be over her head and yet always finds a way to pull things out. Although her leading men need upgrading!,1393372800,,391,4.9393939393939394

4480411,5,B004UXVEUS,I like the fact that the characters are more to real life and not the super spy type.  Piper is great as Annie plays the part well.,1393200000,,131,3.8518518518518516

Innuendos to sex, but their handling of it seems to be a waste of time.  But then, sex and profanity ,to me , are just a lack of talent  by the writers.

4480428,5,B004UXVEUS,"This is my favorite kind of series, where the characters continue from program to program, but each episode stands by itself as a separate story. You don't have to worry about seeing them in the wrong order or missing a link. The series is well acted with chacters I look forward to seeing again (especially the blind character).",1392854400,,329,4.689655172413793

4480436,4,B004UXVEUS,"USA does it again. They keep the show on the edge of awesome, holding back just enough to keep it from FX or AMC, but solid casts, decent story lines and well done cinematography has me hooked again. 2 season in 2 weeks.",1392508800,,220,4.1395348837209305

4480441,5,B004UXVEUS,I didn't know if I would like it but I love it. I wish season 4 was on Amazon. I went to the web but it asks you to pay for the season. Season 5 looks like it will be awesome too.,1392336000,,179,3.2857142857142856

4480444,4,B004UXVEUS,"Female lead character is quirky, strong, and not afraid to make her own decisions.  Supporting cast offers a nice selection of personalities that lend to the flavor of this show.",1392249600,,178,4.933333333333334
4480445,5,B004UXVEUS,"This is fast moving, easy to follow, and has a great underlying thread following the not quite right status of the CIA. No foul language, it is suitable for teen age viewing. I looked forward to each episode.",1392249600,,208,4.5

4480449,5,B004UXVEUS,covert affairs season 2 has great characters that are totally entertaining. You are able to guess what comes next but that's ok!,1391990400,,128,4.863636363636363

4480451,4,B004UXVEUS,Fun episodes that are quick and entertaining.  Pretty decent characters and some spy action.  I don't think it is 100% believable but is not super corny either.,1391990400,,160,4.888888888888889
4480452,5,B004UXVEUS,Great show really captivating keeps you on the edge of your seat. Really interesting stuff they do also action packed with a good plot that keeps you interested,1391990400,,160,4.75

4480456,4,B004UXVEUS,"I'm not completely sure why this show has captured me.  I'm a 60+ grandmother and likely not the target audience.  I think it's because I enjoy the lead character and her relationship with her sister.  Also, Auggie is just too cute and a heartrending character.",1391990400,,261,4.7555555555555555
4480457,5,B004UXVEUS,"I know this is Hollywood, but, it's a keen insight to how political even something like the CIA can become! Pretty good story lines and very good acting. Covert Affairs is an entertaining and delightful show! Annie is surely becoming hardened to the CIA way of life.",1391990400,,266,4.680851063829787
4480458,3,B004UXVEUS,"I really enjoy this show, but do get tired that the producers persists in trying to make it a chick flic. Why cannot we have a secret agent how just happens to be female? Why must we put up with skin all over the place?
Does Benedict Cumberbatch display his chest in every episode of Sherlock?, No.
Does anyone wear cocktail dresses every day at work? No.
But every female on this show does. And that is what bothers me. The stories are great but the way the women are dressed is WRONG.
It is not that I do not enjoy watching beautiful women wearing less than they should. I just am saying dressing them in such fashion does not advance the story. Sorry.",1391990400,,654,4.282258064516129
4480459,3,B004UXVEUS,the show itself was kind of boring but had its good parts. Annie made stupid mistakes that wouldn't make sense in an actual CIA agent,1391904000,,133,4.36
4480460,5,B004UXVEUS,Very likable characters and well developed plot. Each season seems to get better. Looking forward to more episodes. Well done!,1391817600,,126,5.35
4480461,5,B004UXVEUS,"I am enjoying the Covert Affairs series.  I watched season 1, got hooked, and now I'm watching season 2.  Great show.",1391817600,,117,4.523809523809524
4480462,4,B004UXVEUS,"The actors still outshine the material in Season 2.  I was hoping the storylines and the writing would pick up in the second season but haven't seen much evidence of that.  I'm also torn about the decision to write out Annie's family.  On the one hand her relationship with her sister and nieces wasn't done very well, on the other that part of the story gave Annie a dimension she doesn't have any more.",1391817600,,404,4.4324324324324325
4480463,4,B004UXVEUS,I was looking for a show to watch and came across this one.  I Really enjoy it. I watch episodes every night,1391817600,,108,3.909090909090909
4480464,5,B004UXVEUS,"Season two is better than season one as the writers did not have to include so much back story into the episodes.  The missions and drama inside the CIA could be more developed.

Being able to stream a few shows in a sitting is great",1391731200,,233,4.155555555555556
4480465,1,B004UXVEUS,"The content of Covert Affairs was excellent, however, the feed through Amazon (Prime Member) was awful.  I was not able to watch a whole episode without multiple buffering and ""Exit Playback"" messages.  My Internet connection is just fine, and I have no problems with other, similar apps.  I hope this does not continue, I love the choices and simplicity of using Amazon Video, but will rethink my membership if something isn't updated.",1391731200,,436,5.027777777777778
4480466,5,B004UXVEUS,I enjoy this show very much.  The actors are excellent and the story lines are well put together.  There is just the right amount of suspense.,1391558400,,142,4.423076923076923
4480467,4,B004UXVEUS,"I enjoy watching ""spy"" type shows and this one is easy to follow and keeps me coming back for more.  Characters are relatable and story is easy to follow, even if you skip an episode.",1391558400,,183,4.228571428571429
4480468,5,B004UXVEUS,Great show. The actors are great. If you are a person that loves adventure then this is the show for you. Amazon prime makes it easy to watch all the episodes. The first three seasons are currently included in the prime membership.,1391558400,,231,4.523809523809524
4480469,4,B004UXVEUS,"Fast moving-Good looking ,people, good story line. A lot of action. I love all of the charachters Keep up the good work",1391558400,,119,4.454545454545454
4480470,3,B004UXVEUS,I found that the sequences keep the pace of story-telling up to speed.  It has all the basics of protagonist/antagonist with a fresh antagonist each time but the same good looking girl protagonist.  Love interests are worked in every sequence but without any consequence of two individual intertwining their lives exactly.  Never-the-less the conflict mostly remains within the CIA organization.  Each of the actors is attractive and not necessarily sinister.,1391472000,,459,5.514285714285714
4480471,3,B004UXVEUS,"Sometimes strains credulity that one spy can do all this stuff from week to week.  After awhile, you just say ""Oh well"", sit back and go with the flow.",1391472000,,151,4.206896551724138
4480472,5,B004UXVEUS,Great show about the struggles a agent goes through on a daily basis. Can't wait until other seasons become prime.,1391385600,,114,4.75
4480473,5,B004UXVEUS,Overall the stories are all very predictable (I don't mind this because at the moment I just want something light to take my mind off things for a while).  It is the characters and their interactions with each other that make this such a great show.  They are very likable.,1391299200,,273,4.44
4480474,5,B004UXVEUS,"We find this show to be very enjoyable and engaging.  These spies are fine actors, highly attractive and engaging.  Some of the plots are more dense than others, and some have more twists.  The relationship with the sister is emblematic of how hard it is to have a normal life, and perhaps that is true of everyone in this modern society.  It's a strange job description to lie, trick, steal and sometimes maim or kill, and more perplexing that some of the characters attempt to keep their humanity whereas others appear to have closed their hearts.  Again this is emblematic of the human condition.  BTW I love the theme and the opening credits. It's good to look at these people with warmth in your heart.",1391299200,,707,4.616
4480475,4,B004UXVEUS,Its a good story line. I am watching all the seasons and am holding out hope that the fight scenes get a little less cliche and tacky. And the editing gets better. The main character seems to LOSING confidence the more she does her job. Again its worth waiting for the story to continue but they are my current gripes about the show.,1391212800,,333,4.301587301587301
4480476,4,B004UXVEUS,"This was a fairly good show, I watched all seasons as I wanted to see how it progressed.  Good characters, and a descent plot.",1391212800,,126,4.25
4480477,5,B004UXVEUS,Love this show. Love amazon prime. I enjoy watching whole season to catch up!  My fav. Is suggest and Annie friendship,1391126400,,118,4.619047619047619
4480478,4,B004UXVEUS,"I always enjoy a good spy novel or movie. This series keeps me interested through all the episodes. There is constant intrigue,many chases, good characters. Always someone new in each segment. If you like good CIA flicks then you will enjoy Covert affairs. I was not aware of the series until it became available on Amazon",1391126400,,322,4.767857142857143
4480479,4,B004UXVEUS,I usually watch one show a day. I keep watching this one. I've been following it off and on since season 1.,1391126400,,107,3.909090909090909
4480480,5,B004UXVEUS,Fun fast paced well acted and wonderful international locations make it a pleasure to watch. Enjoyed multiple episodes in sequence,1391040000,,130,5.55
4480481,5,B004UXVEUS,"First of all the transmission quality of the series in HD has been outstanding.
The story line, acting and photography of the series in my opinion is also outstanding. Hopefully someone will get a Golden Globe nomination or even an actual award for their hard work.
Piper Perabo is one of the best actresses I have seen on television or on the Big Screen. The supporting cast and guest stars are of such variety that it keeps the material fresh and interesting,. An excellent who done it series.",1391040000,,495,4.636363636363637
4480482,5,B004UXVEUS,Found this show on Amazon and love it. Watching multiple episode per night and just finished. Sad to have it end- looking forward to next year!,1391040000,,143,4.538461538461538
4480483,5,B004UXVEUS,great twists and turns. great characters very fun to watch them interact and grow. you never know what will happen next,1391040000,,119,4.714285714285714
4480484,5,B004UXVEUS,This is my favorite.  It's clean and a very good spy show. I like all the actors who do a great job.,1390953600,,100,3.5454545454545454
4480485,5,B004UXVEUS,"Awesome serie!! This is what I was looking for after 24!!! Loved it!! Action, drama and everything you need to have a good time with popcorn!",1390953600,,141,4.461538461538462
4480486,1,B004UXVEUS,"I'll just quote my review of season three:
""I'm a spy movie fan and I'd like to go with the fantasy, but it's just too contrived. It's so predictable that it's not much fun.""
I jumped to season 3 without watching much of 2 or 1 thinking that if it's been renewed for that many seasons, it must be getting better. Right? Wrong. Slightly, ever so slightly, more polished. The writing is very amateurish.",1390953600,,401,4.4324324324324325
4480487,4,B004UXVEUS,"Love it. Great story lines, and exciting. The only thing i don't like is the obvious blue screen on several scenes.",1390953600,,115,4.523809523809524
4480488,5,B004UXVEUS,Started slow in season one but gets better as you move through the seasons.  I would recommend the show for family,1390953600,,114,4.428571428571429
4480489,5,B004UXVEUS,I wish I had known about this show sooner. The plots are interesting. Character development is good. Action and locations great. Would highly recommend.,1390953600,,152,5.375
4480490,5,B004UXVEUS,"We have really enjoyed watching this series, which we had not heard of before. The characters are engaging, and it doesn't have the dark, gratuitous violence that some spy shows have. Yes, there is shooting, but it is understood that this isn't entirely serious. And the ending is always happy for the main characters. A fun watch.",1390953600,,331,4.824561403508772
4480491,5,B004UXVEUS,I generally don't watch television. Just too much else to do and prefer to read if I have any free time at all. On a whim I decided to watch an episode of this show to see how my new Kindle Fire HDX worked. That is all it took to get hooked! Annie is awesome and once I met Auggie I was totally SOLD. Had to watch an episode every night until I finished Season Two. Then I bought Season Three on DVD so I can watch it all at once. It will arrive tomorrow.

WHEN I WATCH A SHOW IM IN IT FOR A GOOD STORY LINE TO, TO KEEP ME INTERESTED, TO MAKE ME WANT TO WATCH THE NEXT EPISODE RIGHT AWAY... UNLIKE SEASON 1, WHERE IT WAS HARD TO KEEP MY ATTENTION, SEASON 2 HAD A SUB-PLOT THAT HAD ME WATCHING THE WHOLE SEASON IN LESS THAN 3 DAYS... (IM A CHRONIC BINGE WATCHER FOR TV SHOWS)

I ALSO ENJOY WATCHING A GOOD STRONG FEMALE LEAD SHOW AS WELL, PIPER PERABO DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB AT THAT.

4480512,4,B004UXVEUS,"This is a fun, entertaining show. It strikes a good balance between character development, story, and action, without really overdoing any one key element. It does remind of ""Alias,"" (but i never judge on originality) so if you liked that show, you'll probably enjoy this one too. The biggest difference I see between the 2 shows is this one seems a little more light hearted, which makes for a more relaxed viewing experience at the end of a work day, even though there are still plenty of intense action and chase sequences. Piper is a joy to watch and the rest of the cast is also great. I reserve 5 stars for the absolute best, so a 4 for me is still quite strong and highly recommended.

4480559,4,B004UXVEUS,"I have seen three out of the four seasons that are on offer at present.  Season 5 is in production and will air the summer of 2014.
I enjoyed the first two seasons, because they were fairly plausible.  I guess I can be called a ""purist"" because I like it when there is some similitude between the truth and the deeds and actions.  For example, the heroine of the piece gets into a tight spot in a foreign country and then she is back at Langley and there is no explanation how she came so far so quickly.  Also, the military equipment has to be ""right"" i.e. vehicles and weapons should be the ones used by the countries that are portrayed.  Nothing puts me off more than to see Russian soldiers driving American trucks.  Still, that is just ""me"" I guess.  There is action galore and suspense by the bucket!  The story is moving all the time, so from that standpoint, it is very entertaining.  You find yourself having to catch your breath after each of the break-neck pursuits.  Those are the bits that I would give 5 Stars to.  Now, the bad news:  Where it really falls down is the main character herself.  She is undisciplined and has little respect for authority.  She goes her own way, against direct orders and consequently gets her backside in a sling most of the time.  She always has to rely on others to get her out of the scrapes she creates, most of which were totally avoidable.  She gets other people killed unnecessarily because of her being a loose cannon.  And, by the time you get to season three, the predicaments she gets into are infuriating and the escapes become more and more unlikely.  After three seasons, a lot of the tension is gone because you know this Mata Harri is going to get through it all no matter how great the odds or unlikely the success of the rescue plans.  There are at least a half a dozen times in the series when she should have been shot dead without any doubt if this was real life and yet, she gets away!  If this young lady worked for me, I would give her a job in the company canteen, chain her to her position, allowing her to only leave for potty breaks!  I won't be watching season 4 or 5, because I can already guess what is going to happen.  They have to keep re-working the murdery bits and the intrigues between the characters.  To the plus side of the ledger:  The cast is very good and you feel a rapport with the main characters, which is what happens when the actors do a good job.  This series is hugely popular, having its own website and ways of following your favorite characters.  If you are able to overlook the many and obvious short comings and keep telling yourself ""remember, this is only telly"" then you will pass many enjoyable evenings, because each season is 16 episodes.  For my account, though, I have had enough.",1389139200,,2790,4.3879142300194935
4480560,5,B004UXVEUS,"This season, like all other seasons, was very entertaining. This show has passion beyond belief. The cast us mesmorizing and are truly great actors.",1389139200,,148,5.208333333333333

4480563,4,B004UXVEUS,I have enjoyed the program very much.  It keeps you coming back to find out the inter-action between the characters and also the content of each episode.  I know a retired CIA operative and some of his experiences and a few of the story lines are similar.,1389139200,,255,4.404255319148936
4480564,3,B004UXVEUS,"This show has a few things going for it. Piper Perabo (playing the principle character: 'Annie' Walker) is very sexy, and the producers aren't afraid to show her in some sexy clothing and poses that make me... Christopher Gorham (playing 'Augie' Anderson) is also quite sexy (for the ladies) and once again the revealing outfits and workout scenes are abundant. The costumes, locations, sets and props are superb. It's a very stylish show, with high production value. The music (especially the title track by Flint Eastwood) is killer and the overall production value superb.  The problem with this show? The writing; specifically the portrayal of the CIA (and other intelligence agencies). The show routinely shows CIA agents conducting covert ops inside the U.S., targeting U.S. persons for ops, breaking various laws, acting in irresponsible and illegal ways. Their interaction with other intelligence agencies is always competitive, antagonistic and marked by direct competition. The ignorance (or is it disinformation?) regarding U.S. intelligence agencies (do five minutes of research on Google, why don't you?!) is disturbing, insulting, and distracting. The acting ranges from fair to downright abysmal - If Christopher Gorham is supposed to play a blind person why is he constantly dodging furniture, doorways and objects directly in his path? Is the director awake during the shoot? I don't think I'll make it beyond season two. It's fun to watch for a season or two (I saw season one as well), but ultimately this show will run out of steam.",1389139200,,1552,5.232931726907631

Not as intense as Homeland but certainly entertaining.",1388620800,,142,5.454545454545454
4480588,5,B004UXVEUS,Interesting characters and lots of action make Covert Affairs a good watch.  We're ooking forward to another season and  more episodes!,1388534400,,135,5.380952380952381

4480591,4,B004UXVEUS,"As a member of the general public, I have no idea whether this series bears any resemblance to real Agency practices or personnel -- I have to assume it probably does not. Annie Walker does what I would consider some dumb things with a lack of foresight, and she certainly is not inconspicuous. However, it's a television drama, not a documentary, and it's fun to watch. I appreciate the character's quick thinking in various situations, her comfort with languages and in several different countries and the behind-the-scenes departmental intrigue; however, this appears to take over the show later in the season, which takes away some of the appeal for me.
Depth of characters is decent for what would be considered an action show; production values are good. If the plot lines are improbable, again, it's good entertainment for 48 minutes.",1388448000,,841,5.014285714285714
4480592,5,B004UXVEUS,"The show is exciting, the acting very well done, except for high speed foot chases in three or four heels (smile) and the scripts are mostly really good.  I really like the show.",1388448000,,178,4.393939393939394

4480601,5,B004UXVEUS,"Season 2 offers the same high quality stories and characters as season 1, plus takes the viewers to more foreign locales. Annie Walker's life becomes more complicated when she decides to tell her sister, Danielle, that she's not really working for the Smithsonian, but the CIA. Her sister reacts badly, kicking Annie out of her guest house. In the season finale, Danielle accidentally becomes involved in one of Annie's missions and sees first hand how great her sister performs as a field operative. The truth behind the Ben Mercer character is explained and gets resolved. Auggie gets romantically involved with the younger sister of one of his deceased Army Special Forces buddies, and Jai Wilcox starts showing characteristics of his less than honorable father and former Director of Clandestine Services, now directed by Arthur Campbell. Jai deceives many in the CIA and his father in order to climb the ladder within the agency. As always, there are plenty of stories and plot twists.",1388188800,,990,5.079754601226994

4480608,5,B004UXVEUS,Great show I watched it before When I had television know I can watch it again. Word requirements for reviews are stupid,1388016000,,120,4.5
4480609,5,B004UXVEUS,Covert Affairs has some great actors and storylines that are believable. Each segment is interesting and not over the top as some spy thrillers today. Like any good series it steers the audience toward watching the next show.,1387843200,,225,4.947368421052632
4480610,4,B004UXVEUS,This show has good story lines and makes you interested in the characters. There's also enough intrigue to keep you interested,1387843200,,126,5.0476190476190474

4480612,4,B004UXVEUS,"Much of the behavior of the characters reflects that of the agency.on the negative side there is lot that is patently incredible, if not absurd.

Overall a very good show.",1387670400,,171,4.7
4480613,5,B004UXVEUS,"I needed to catch up on this season, so I went ahead and purchased some of the episodes on here. Fantastic show, clean (for a crime sort of show), and it's nice to get to know the characters.",1387584000,,191,4.052631578947368
4480614,5,B004UXVEUS,Covert Affairs is an awesome show! Very action-packed and interesting for everyone! I hope they make more seasons to watch soon!,1387497600,,128,5.142857142857143

4480616,4,B004UXVEUS,Covert Affairs  is very well written and directed and casting is excellent.plus the acting is some of the best for TV series. The only criticism is more superficial regarding the fact that Joan wears almost the same dress and spike heels each day--do CIA officials really dress like this? Maybe the weather in DC has become more tropical?,1387497600,,338,4.827586206896552

4480619,3,B004UXVEUS,"The show is fairly typical in its solving of disastrous situation often with a deus ex machina ending that makes little sense.  There is enough cover story, however, to make several of the character interesting.  It is good escapist fare",1387324800,,237,4.9
4480620,5,B004UXVEUS,love the characters!!!!!!! Love the story and how it take you to different places in the world. And boy does it portray the politics and how they are played everywhere.,1387324800,,168,4.633333333333334
4480621,5,B004UXVEUS,Very entertaining show.  The plot lines twist and there are times you really hope the government doesn't work the way it is portrayed.,1387324800,,134,4.826086956521739
4480622,5,B004UXVEUS,The plot thickens and she still doesn't pick up a gun until the very end. Great development of her relationship with her sister. Keep watching!,1387324800,,143,4.76

4480625,4,B004UXVEUS,"This was the first time I had ever seen the actress Piper Perabo who plays the lead role of Annie, an agent working for the CIA.  She has this vulnerability about her as well as a strength that makes her an ideal choice for the role.  I love the interaction between her and Augie as well.  I also find it interesting to see  the actor who plays Augie was a co-producer of the show as well.  The actor who portrays the character Eiel (spelling?) is very dramatic and convincing in his interactions with Annie .  A must-see for anyone who enjoys a dramatic spy show.  It does not disappoint!",1387238400,,589,4.348623853211009
4480626,5,B004UXVEUS,"The lady star Piper Perabo is simply believable as a CIA agent.  The episodes are
refreshing with world-wide setting that inform and can be

that Catalonia area.",1387152000,,224,4.868421052631579

I am enjoying the stories and want to see what happens next to the characters.  It's just the kind of escapism I prefer in today's reality.  And I particularly like that my favorite characters survive and have more or less happy endings in each episode.  Not too dark, not too light,....it's just right.",1387065600,,405,4.506849315068493

4480634,5,B004UXVEUS,"Piper Perabo kicks butt! ;-)  Able to hold her own - no comparison to Jennifer Garner in Alias, but the show is equally unique and action packed and charming. Season 2 had more drama/emotion than season 1, IMHO, and Season 3 is better yet (although I've only watched the first few episodes thus far).  I only discovered the show about 3 weeks ago, and watched all of Season 1 within 72 hours! ;-)  Each episode has just enough plot and twists to keep me entertained without going overboard.",1386892800,,490,4.545454545454546
4480635,3,B004UXVEUS,Some of the sequence themes are repetitive from season one and so that makes them predictable but the show remains entertaining.,1386633600,,128,5.142857142857143

4480637,3,B004UXVEUS,"I Liked Covert Affairs, but it can be predictable. The lead Spy was questionable at times, yes,  and almost unbelieveable.",1386374400,,122,5.1
4480638,4,B004UXVEUS,"I was under the impression, apparently not true, that CIA agents were picked because of their ability to ""b l e n d  i n"".  Maybe I am wrong, but the female lead stood out like a sore thumb. And since you don't carry a gun in the CIA, it seems keeping your hair short would be more in keeping with the job.  Oh well, viva Hollywood and good old cellluloid or should I say digital. All in all, Covert Affairs is worth a few grins.",1386374400,,429,3.9651162790697674
4480639,4,B004UXVEUS,"I really like this show, but second season the acting is not as good. This is an ""ops"" series. If you see a major flaw in the
plan, it ruins it for me. Intrigue and light intrigue is my favorite genre. I read and view a lot. I know there are only so many plots, but please do it well.
The light side of this has kept my interest. However, it is wearing thin.",1386374400,,358,3.8513513513513513

4480647,5,B004UXVEUS,"This show, so far, has been fun to watch -- a little suspense, comedy, romance, and outstanding performances by a stellar cast.  It's one of our ""go to"" shows when our DVR programs are used up and we want something special to watch.",1385769600,,232,4.395348837209302

I started at season one, of course, and watched the 3rd season, too. My husband even watched it with me. We both got hooked by Piper Parabo and the other cast members. The story plots were very interesting, too. I almost envied The actors getting to go to so many places in the world to film this show!  Be careful, you may become addicted, too!",1384819200,,498,4.242105263157895

A great way to pass the time on my morning exercise routine on the treadmill. Time goes by so fast I don't even realize how long I have gone. Commercial free makes it an even better score on PRIME.  A great cast and always great story line. I will continue to watch it. Looking forward to Season 3 on PRIME. Love this show:)",1384387200,,435,4.117647058823529

A former Iraq war veteran who lost his sight in battle, and now he fights from a desk and his computer.  The star of the show, Piper Perabo, is an agent who always manages to complete her mission with Augie's help and at the pleasure of her boss, Joan, who is a captivating lady of capable leadership.",1384387200,,460,4.3882352941176475

4480668,5,B004UXVEUS,"This series stayed well hidden on USA network, I missed it.  I only discovered it on Amazon Prime and found it addicting.  My wife and I have watched one or two episodes every night for a month.  The production value is amazing for a non-network show.  It must have a generous budget because it is filmed on location all over the world.  The cast is excellent and the writing is as well.  This is a far better production than most shows on the big networks. And there are as many as 18 shows per season!

I bought the first two seasons on DVD and will buy seasons three and four when they are available. The design above seems to suggest it is available in Blu Ray, but I didn't find that on Amazon.  I'll look for2012 and2013 in Blu Ray when I order them. Hope they keep making them in the future.",1384300800,,798,4.203947368421052

4480674,4,B004UXVEUS,The first 3 episodes were fair. But the rest of Season 1 was great. We are half way through Season 2 and think it  really good!  Love the characters.  Hope it continues.,1383696000,,169,4.21875

Crazy about the Annie Walker character rocking red bottom shoes to work
Who does that? LOL",1383696000,,118,4.95
4480677,4,B004UXVEUS,Good and balanced - surprised it did not go further.  We'll it is likely due to the lack of over the top effects that other spy flicks exhibit. Can't say but the value of realism,1383696000,,178,4.085714285714285

4480679,5,B004UXVEUS,The best spy series I've seen in years.  I caught a current episode and liked it so much that I went back and bought the previous seasons.  Totally worth it.,1383523200,,157,4.2
4480680,5,B004UXVEUS,Piper Perabo is a kick but CIA agent. Augie is amazingly hot and never disappoints with a great topless scene.,1383436800,,110,4.55
4480681,4,B004UXVEUS,Prime Membership Offers Best Value  The quality of delivery is great and the content is worth watching. Selection of TV shows are good.,1383436800,,135,4.869565217391305
4480682,4,B004UXVEUS,Sometimes cheesy ... but a guilty pleasure. The lead character and her platinum blonde boss are smart and easy on the eyes. A fun escape.,1383436800,,137,4.52
4480683,4,B004UXVEUS,"Just a good show. If you like shows like Alias, Bones, Flashpoint, or Burn Notice you will probably like Cover Affairs.",1383350400,,119,4.714285714285714

4480687,4,B004UXVEUS,"Interesting characters, exciting sometimes complex stories, but in some episodes changing friends and partners too frequently. Some countries really look bad in it and Annie's judgement is always right. If real life was that easy...",1383177600,,232,5.6571428571428575
4480688,5,B004UXVEUS,What I like about this series it's fast fast acting and each episode is entire storyline so if you miss one it's okay.,1383177600,,118,4.173913043478261
4480689,1,B004UXVEUS,"I like the actors but the writers have really dropped the ball on this show. Drama and suspense are good things,Mia. In this series.",1383091200,,132,4.541666666666667
4480690,5,B004UXVEUS,Good entertainment.  I love the episodes.  Definitely worth my time to watch Covert Affairs.  I like variety and it has plenty of different stories.,1383091200,,148,5.083333333333333
4480691,5,B004UXVEUS,"Love watching this show. Piper Perabo does a wonderful job. If you're into CIA action shows, this show is for you!",1383091200,,114,4.476190476190476

4480696,4,B004UXVEUS,"The plots were varied enough to keep you interested and there were enough personal character stories going on to keep the main story from being monolithic.  Loved the characters, even Annie, who was a bit on the arrogant side, but soft enough to pull it off.  Auggie is probably everyone's favorite.  The others were a good mix of different personalities.",1383091200,,355,4.883333333333334
4480697,3,B004UXVEUS,"So this is sort go a guilty pleasure for me. The lead character is very stereotypical and all the characters are a bit too simple and stereotypical. But the action and story lines move enough to keep me coming back. There's nothing extraordinary  or compelling about it, I just watch it when I want to watch tv but there's no new episodes of shows I really like. I would definitely not watch it if it weren't free through amazon prime.",1383091200,,435,4.4375

4480704,4,B004UXVEUS,"My wife enjoyed watching season two of Covert Affairs on Amazon Prime.  I don't think I would have enjoyed this on TV, as you can tell when they are cutting to commercial. This show is entertainment. As long as you watch it to be entertained, it is worth your time. We have watched the first 3 season's and each season is better then the last.",1382745600,,343,4.276923076923077

4480723,5,B004UXVEUS,"I've enjoyed the series.  I haven't followed it on TV, so it's great to be able to watch the episodes in order, rather than to catch an episode here and there on reruns.  Can't wait for the next season to be available on Prime.",1381795200,,227,4.136363636363637

4480726,3,B004UXVEUS,"With Season 2 the producer started adding words that were unnecessary and toward the second half of the season some bed scenes were thrown in.  The plots were pretty good without the extras.  The character 'Annie' was fresher during the first half when she was sweet and fun loving.  She and 'Auggie"" do well together.  Both are likeable characters. Looking forward to next season.",1381708800,,381,4.90625
4480727,4,B004UXVEUS,"I wasn't too impressed with the first season. The second season seems to work better. I'd like to see more depth to the bad guy's characters. Otherwise it's simply good guys versus bad guys, much too simple.",1381708800,,207,4.621621621621622
4480728,3,B004UXVEUS,"I think the show is well.....lame, but the wife likes it.  After serving twenty years in the military, this just goes a little bit overboard.",1381708800,,141,4.64
4480729,4,B004UXVEUS,Full of action and adventure as always. Season 2 keeps delivering the action adventure and Annie grows into her element.,1381708800,,120,5.05
4480730,5,B004UXVEUS,We loved season 1 and were not disappointed with season 2.  The series continues to be fresh and exciting.  The characters revel more of themselves.  On to season 3!,1381708800,,165,4.620689655172414
4480731,4,B004UXVEUS,"For those of us who lived in D.C., the location shots there are great fun!  We also loved the storyline locations in far away places, such as Morocco.  The shows are really shot there.
The main characters are sympathetic and evolve as the seasons progress. Good time!",1381708800,,267,4.659574468085107

4480733,4,B004UXVEUS,"I'm an action/adventure,S/F kinda guy. A lot of the action is fast but a little contrived. There is very little in the way of science, a lot of fiction. Piper is really fun to look at. Your high fashion,high maintenance, cover girl. But nobody in their right mind would even try some of those stunts in a tight dress and spike heels. The story line is like a paperback romance novel. If that's your thing, your going to love it.",1381622400,,428,4.3625
4480734,3,B004UXVEUS,"I like the way Annie gets things done, even without a gun at times.  I also like the husband and wife team that direct her work.  I enjoy their relationship.  Her sister is her best friend - like mine is.  That tugs at my heart.  Toward the end of the 2nd season, some of the scenes became more predictable.",1381536000,,307,4.135593220338983

4480736,2,B004UXVEUS,"This series is one of the best of this kind of excitement dramas.  Amazon's digital copy is flawed by starts, stops and jumps.  It is short also of the integrity of the first series which set a standard in directing, photography and acting.  I solved my problem by skipping to the third season series.",1381536000,,301,4.537037037037037
4480737,5,B004UXVEUS,Watch the first three seasons on Prime... It was exciting and couldn't wait to watch the next episode. I'm bummed that I cannot watch Season 4 free :(,1381449600,,150,4.392857142857143
4480738,4,B004UXVEUS,"I started watching the show the first season and then was unable to continue due to work committments.  I am now playing catch-up to see how Annie has evolved.  I believe she has grown into her role in the Agency very well.  I also find it fascinating what Ms. Perabo can do in impossibly high heels!  She probably is not actually wearing those in scenes where they are showing her from the waist up.  I am now starting on Season 3.  I have a slow satellite internet service so can only watch in the middle of the night.  Don't do it too often but if I do, I usual make a marathon of it and watch 3 or 4 shows at a time.  I am very glad that I am able to see this series for free as part of my Amazon Prime membership.  Since I am now retired and on a very limited budget, I am glad that this is offered.",1381449600,,804,3.9135802469135803

4480741,5,B004UXVEUS,"I like the diversity of the different plots.  Nice twists and starting to relate to the characters.  However, starting to see subliminal liberal antidotes inserted in the story line, but not a flagrante as other series.  I guess the reality that Hollywood is nothing but a propaganda arm of the Progressive and Democratic party should not be such a surprise - but it certainly is disheartening.  Can't you just have a series free from Progressive indoctrination and brainwashing?  Hopefully next season it won't get worse.",1381449600,,522,5.094117647058823
4480742,4,B004UXVEUS,"Similar to other viewers. I love la femme Nikita, and really liked Alias and Covert Affairs season 1 & 2. Just started season 3 and already like what I've seen so far.",1381449600,,167,4.25
4480743,4,B004UXVEUS,This is a very enjoyable series and keeps you on the edge.of your seat. Never a dull moment with lots of twists and turns and I think it has a good cast and some interesting relationships.,1381449600,,188,4.25
4480744,5,B004UXVEUS,It nice to see a spy drama that doesn't feature the infallible James Bond type character in the staring role.  Lots of action and somewhat believable,1381449600,,149,4.730769230769231
4480745,4,B004UXVEUS,"better than season 1 and still better than season 1, now they need 10 more words. four more, ok, done.",1381449600,,102,4.15
4480746,3,B004UXVEUS,"It is fun looking at a beautiful young woman who is intelligent and always tough, but the episodes are repetitive and it gets progressively more repetitive.  A bit empty.",1381449600,,170,4.862068965517241
4480747,5,B004UXVEUS,"I love action, suspense with a little romance mixed in. Piper is always breaking the rules and taking risks to make things right. A little Jamie Bondish at times and it works well for her. More the romance part than expert at fancy gadgets, but she makes you want to see what happens next. Great show",1381190400,,300,4.375
4480748,5,B004UXVEUS,Each episode is very well done.  The characters are fleshed out and you feel like you know them.  Fun series.,1381104000,,109,4.4
4480749,5,B004UXVEUS,Same review.  Can't wait for the next season to start.  Wish it would go immediately to Amazon Prime (for free).  Don't like the commercials interrupting everything on TV.,1381104000,,171,5.035714285714286

4480751,4,B004UXVEUS,Sean two is just as good as season one. Many series loose my interest after season one but this keeps me coming back for more.,1381104000,,126,4.08
4480752,5,B004UXVEUS,Great show!  All actors are perfect for their roles - casting did great. The fact the show takes you all over the world is definitely a bonus.,1381104000,,142,4.2592592592592595

4480771,5,B004UXVEUS,"The first season starts with Annie being light hearted and innocent which I like. As the seasons progress Annie becomes darker and hell bent on revenge which makes me less interested in her character.

4480773,5,B004UXVEUS,Show is well written  with many twists and turns. Each episode ends with a cliff hanger that has you accessing the next episode immediately.

They both work for a seriously stern but fair boss (who by the way is quite hot) who keeps CIA mission first, but her people a close second.

4480797,5,B004UXVEUS,I  found this series  and season to be one of the best TV series in a long time. It took me a long time before I went to  my kindle and watched this series. I would recommend folks who live-action and  travel to get hooked on Covert  Affairs.,1379548800,,242,3.9583333333333335

4480802,5,B004UXVEUS,"Covert Affairs is exciting. I love strong female action figures, and Annie Walker (Piper Perabo) certainly qualifies. The rest of the cast, especially blind tech expert Augie, are very strong, too.

The CIA of the series is a cutthroat place with many subplots and a lot of infighting, many ops going on inside the US despite the official charter restricting them to working elsewhere. That much is reasonably genuine, but the altruistic and genuinely patriotic main characters are probably much too 'hice' compared to the real thing.

I tend to blame the real CIA for everything from the death of JFK to the assorted false flag operations that threaten to turn our country into a police state. I should hate any series that makes them look good. But...I don't. I thoroughly enjoy watching Covert Affairs. So it must be pretty darn good!",1379548800,,837,4.887323943661972

4480818,5,B004UXVEUS,"I've started the series this summer on Netflix then on Amazon...Can't wait for the next season.  Well written, believable most of the time.  The fight scenes seem realistic where she gets banged up a little, but stubbornly carries on.  Strong women in a male dominated profession.  I especially enjoy the twists and turns of the plots where you never know who to trust.  The medical scenes could use an advisor, and are not very accurate.",1379030400,,438,4.786666666666667

4480850,4,B004UXVEUS,"I enjoyed this series, it had a lot of action and held my interest!  My husband also enjoyed it, too.",1378252800,,101,4.05
4480851,5,B004UXVEUS,Couldn't wait to view each episode.  Intriguing.  Love every aspect of the show.  Piper is excellent as Annie Walker  Love Auggie,1378252800,,129,5.0
4480852,5,B004UXVEUS,I really enjoyed this show.  I watched it on Amazon Prime.  It is well worth it.  The actors are great in it.,1378252800,,109,3.8636363636363638
4480853,5,B004UXVEUS,Even better than the first season.. Love how the characters have been developed... Overall the show pulls the viewers in,1378252800,,120,5.05
4480854,3,B004UXVEUS,Nice show. Fun characters. Annie is a babe and Augie is excellent. Suspension of disbelief required as with most TV.,1378252800,,116,4.85
4480855,5,B004UXVEUS,"It's not a spy show like 24 or Alias as the violence is less 'violent' and occurs less often.  However this absence doesn't impact the suspense ratio as the character development and interplay is well written and acted. There is an ongoing and interesting underlying story line but each episode stands on it's own start and finish. It is at times cute, witty, romantic, adventurous, intriguing and exciting. If you're looking for deep heavy drama...you will find it here on occasion but the general 'atmosphere' of the show is lighter but nonetheless very entertaining. There is some impressive acting, directing and production throughout making this palatable fare for watching and liking.",1378252800,,690,5.216216216216216
4480856,5,B004UXVEUS,Seeing a few commercials were enough to get my attention. Started at season 1 and watched until I was current.  How did I miss this on tv?,1378166400,,138,4.111111111111111
4480857,3,B004UXVEUS,This show is a fun watch. The production values are good and the actors competent. It's a spy show that doesn't take itself too seriously - think Alias-light.,1378166400,,158,4.678571428571429
4480858,5,B004UXVEUS,"I love this show.  It keeps moving forward with new story lines, but maintains the relationships among the characters so you are always guessing.  Never a dull moment.",1378166400,,167,4.928571428571429
4480859,4,B004UXVEUS,"Most of the characters are enjoyable and relatable a few of ""vilians"" are a little over the top and less believable.",1378080000,,116,4.571428571428571
4480860,5,B004UXVEUS,"Totally addicted to this show! So glad on Amazon Prime! Already in 3rd season & I will be sad when I get to the final season! :-( Like a good book! I just can't stop. There was only one episode in season 2 I didn't care for as it was slowly paced, which is unusual for this program. All in all, it's worth the watch!!",1378080000,,317,3.8923076923076922
4480861,4,B004UXVEUS,"Worth watching, fun and not too serious. Like the characters and the story line. Each episode has enough difference to be exciting.",1377993600,,131,5.0
4480862,5,B004UXVEUS,The plots are not well developed and are some times it's hard to believe that Annie Walker is that tough.  But the casting is good  with interesting chemistry between them. Maybe a little less of Annie's home life with her sister would improve the flow of action.,1377993600,,263,4.574468085106383
4480863,5,B004UXVEUS,This is a great spy movie.  It has romance and lots of action.  The story plots are varied and well done.,1377907200,,105,3.9523809523809526

4480865,4,B004UXVEUS,"A girl who is beautiful, smart, tough, sexy, with heavy on the smart.
A genius who is blind but sees every aspect of every situation.
A supervisor who would make any man want to run away from home.
What's not to like?",1377820800,,217,4.190476190476191
4480866,5,B004UXVEUS,"Interesting characters, with a plot that twists and turns, with good pacing to create  emotional tension for the viewer. Very enjoyable and entertaining.",1377820800,,153,5.6521739130434785
4480867,4,B004UXVEUS,"Very entertaining. Gives us a glimpse of the pre-Home Security Agency era
when every agency compete with each other. Congrats!",1377820800,,126,5.35
4480868,5,B004UXVEUS,The wife and I came upon this series by accident.  At first we just watched it to watch something but we seriously got sucked in.  Good stuff!,1377820800,,142,4.222222222222222
4480869,4,B004UXVEUS,Seemingly ripped from the headlines. Helps viewers understand there are real people who have personal lives. Easy burn through a whole season wanting to know what will happen next.,1377820800,,180,5.241379310344827
4480870,5,B004UXVEUS,"Plots lines that twist and turn, people almost believable, [almost because we are so accustomed to principles and ideals being compromised with circumstantial ethics that we find what we want to believe distant from what we see], this is 40 minutes of a quick read of adventure novella on film.",1377820800,,294,4.9
4480871,5,B004UXVEUS,"What could go wrong with a leggy blonde  .....  Blind back up, and a supporting cast of seasoned professionals?  This is a MUST SEE series that will steal your heart.",1377734400,,166,4.466666666666667
4480872,5,B004UXVEUS,I love the characters and how they interact with one another. The actors paly off each other in a great fashion.,1377734400,,112,4.380952380952381
4480873,5,B004UXVEUS,Season 2 hit the right balance between fun and serious with a female Bond figure.  I enjoyed it very much.,1377734400,,106,4.3
4480874,5,B004UXVEUS,"Piper Perabo is perfect in this role. I'm really glad that amazon offers this show as part of prime. Too bad I have to pay for the newest episodes, but I do because it's one of my favorite.",1377734400,2,189,4.0
4480875,4,B004UXVEUS,"Seasons 1 and 2 were pretty entertaining.  The storyline about a young enthusiastic person becoming a big-time CIA agent was a nice story.  Some things were kind of implausible - like the head of the CIA is married to one of his directors, etc.  But the story is a decent premise.",1377734400,,280,4.450980392156863
4480876,5,B004UXVEUS,"Covert Affairs is excellent programming.  The characters are very original, and credible people.  I especially like Annie and Auggie and their friendship is refreshing.  The plots are generally good.  Occasionally, Annie is sort of out of this world strong like when she pushed a big attacker off of the boat in a recent episode.",1377734400,,329,5.037037037037037
4480877,5,B004UXVEUS,Very cute show piper Peabo fun to watch. Love watching while working out. Give it a shot. Lots of fun,1377734400,,101,4.1

4480879,4,B004UXVEUS,Like the spy stuff as well as the interpersonal relationships. It's never predictable.  The international locals are fun to see too.,1377648000,,132,5.285714285714286
4480880,4,B004UXVEUS,"My husband & I both enjoyed this show and are hoping it continues for a while! Not one to watch with kids, though.",1377648000,,114,4.0

So had to order to see what I missed.",1377648000,,100,4.05
4480882,5,B004UXVEUS,"Normally a show about a hot chick who works as a spy (typical low budget Hollywood B-movie) wouldn't interest me. But what the heck... on a lazy summer day with nothing else to do I decided to give it a shot. Surprisingly well written and a great acting cast. The story line will keep you invested, and looking forward to the next episode.",1377561600,,339,4.396825396825397
4480883,4,B004UXVEUS,"If you like the Plum series you will like this show. The lead is CIA, but never carries a gun. Beware that just like the Plum novels it gets old in that the plots are all pretty much the same.  Watch a few for good entertainment, but after a while you will get bored.",1377561600,,267,3.9444444444444446
4480884,3,B004UXVEUS,"I thought the plot was a bit contrived.  Too much action and too little thought.  Cute ideas like Ukrainians who love chocolate and agents who know swear words, and only swear words...  Not impressed.",1377561600,,200,4.823529411764706
4480885,5,B004UXVEUS,Particularly interesting these days in light of all the news about Government intelligence collecting. Surprising plot twists keep one coming back for more.,1377561600,,156,5.826086956521739
4480886,5,B004UXVEUS,"Watchable series that entertains and is believable.  Like the idea of Washington being the ""home base"" of the series as we lived in that area.  Entertaining but not a lot of blood & guts.",1377561600,,187,4.470588235294118
4480887,4,B004UXVEUS,"Good enough to keep me watching. Nothing spectacular though. Later seasons do get better. As a spy thriller, there are better options. This is more drama than thriller.",1377561600,,168,5.035714285714286
4480888,4,B004UXVEUS,but... i want Auggie and Annie to be together already!! I can see how they flirt and he gave her a car!!!!,1377561600,,106,3.8636363636363638
4480889,5,B004UXVEUS,"I enjoy the action, characters and lead, Ms Perabo, very much. An ingenue, female spy with all the right moves.",1377561600,,111,4.6
4480890,4,B004UXVEUS,"A good all around show similar in some ways to Alias.  Every now and then a cheesy scene.  Wish she would get a gun, though.",1377475200,,124,3.92
4480891,5,B004UXVEUS,This show is so addicting. Its great because it has it all. The quality is great. Don't miss out on a fantastic show but be prepared to keep watching because once you've started it will be hard to turn the TV off. Amazon instant streaming is great.,1377475200,,248,4.297872340425532
4480892,5,B004UXVEUS,Unlike some shows this one is not predictable. They air in different parts of the world. Piper plays the role very well.,1377475200,,120,4.5
4480893,5,B004UXVEUS,Have been watching this show from the beginning and am glad to see that the next seasons have come out.,1377388800,,103,4.2
4480894,5,B004UXVEUS,I absolutely love this show! I like how it is a realistic spy show and doesn't have all of the fake scenes that normal crime tv dramas have. Would definitely recommend :),1377302400,,170,4.34375
4480895,5,B004UXVEUS,"Great Price and Great Product.  I would purchase from this seller again, which I have.  Thank You again for having a great product with a low price. Thanks a Million",1377302400,,165,4.466666666666667
4480896,5,B004UXVEUS,I love this show! I'm glad amazon has it on instant streaming. I don't like that you have to pay for the new episodes when you can watch then online free.,1377216000,,154,4.0
4480897,5,B004UXVEUS,"Love Annie and Augie. Intriguing, dramatic and interesting drama. Enjoy the storyline of espionage and romance intertwined.  Would recommend to everyone.",1377216000,,153,6.285714285714286

4480899,2,B004UXVEUS,"I'm only watching this series because I've run out of other things to watch. I'm so tired of seeing women who chase bad guys in 3"" heels! The intro to the show with the motorcycle is just silly. It's ok but not great.",1377216000,,217,4.069767441860465
4480900,5,B004UXVEUS,Like the show.  Annie is a good actress but Auggie is better.  The blind man with nerves of steal always saves the day in a unique way.,1377216000,,135,3.962962962962963
4480901,4,B004UXVEUS,"excellent show, a through back to the show ALAIS.  a very good show with some good turns and twists.  Worth checking out.",1377216000,,121,4.454545454545454
4480902,5,B004UXVEUS,I like the show and it's a convenient way to watch!  When and where you like with no issues.  Rating however is a pain.,1377216000,,119,3.9166666666666665
4480903,3,B004UXVEUS,"This is a feel good CIA show. It doesn't have any oomph, until season 3. But I still watch it because it is a good entertainment.",1377216000,,129,4.0
4480904,5,B004UXVEUS,I am hooked on this show and only started watching because it was free with Prime. Obsessed - love the locations and situations Annie finds herself in.,1377216000,,151,4.62962962962963

4480906,4,B004UXVEUS,"Second season follows Annie as she gains experience with the CIA and her coworkers.  New characters are introduced.  Towards the end of the season, she realized the value of guns in her job, but it isn't an overpowering presence and her wits and training keep her on the safe side as much as any weapon.  Still fresh and very enjoyable.",1377216000,,336,4.566666666666666
4480907,5,B004UXVEUS,Attention griping.  Drama.. Action.  We have enjoyed every season available. Recommend it to everyone. Very good.  Each episode makes you want to watch the next one,1377129600,,164,5.230769230769231
4480908,4,B004UXVEUS,Liked the action and the star of the project.  Would recommend to others who are interested in the CIA.  Very informational.,1377129600,,124,4.857142857142857
4480909,2,B004UXVEUS,They really dragged out the no gun and her always needed help to escape. You almost lost me as a watcher this season,1377043200,,116,4.086956521739131
4480910,4,B004UXVEUS,i really like the actors and the characters they portray.  the action is not a lot of blood and guts.  just twists and turns to think about  (forgive the typing  i just broke my arm.),1377043200,,183,4.142857142857143
4480911,5,B004UXVEUS,Wish the storytelling could go on and on ... it is like a good book you cannot put down.  It never is boring!,1376956800,,109,3.739130434782609
4480912,5,B004UXVEUS,"I really enjoy everything about this little show. It's entertaining, thrilling, fun, and it relieves my stress at the end of a hard day's work.
I get so involved with the next spy mission that it transports me to the next international city right along with Annie.
Good acting and good plots.",1376956800,,292,4.634615384615385

4480914,5,B004UXVEUS,I was sucked in pretty quickly to this action packed show!  I really like the characters of Annie Walker and of Augie.,1376956800,,118,4.363636363636363
4480915,4,B004UXVEUS,Enjoyable characters to watch as they play their roles in this CIA series.  The story lines are interesting and there are very nice action scenes to compliment each story.,1376956800,,171,4.896551724137931
4480916,5,B004UXVEUS,"Good acting, good writing.  The first 2 seasons were very thrilling to watch.  The 3rd season is still very good but it becomes predictable.",1376956800,,140,4.791666666666667
4480917,5,B004UXVEUS,"Watched all the episodes, very entertaining, characters definitely grew on us and were developed along logical lines (kinda). Wish there was less violence but that is just me, husband liked that part!",1376870400,,200,5.28125
4480918,5,B004UXVEUS,"Definitely keeps your interest. We like the fact that we can watch anytime without commercials, and have many episodes to go to when nothing of interest on TV. Great for summer time watching especially.",1376784000,,202,4.970588235294118
4480919,5,B004UXVEUS,I'm hooked on this show. I really don't watch TV on a regular basis so this is unusual for me. Highly recommend!,1376784000,,112,4.136363636363637
4480920,3,B004UXVEUS,I enjoy this show and the gradual bond between the characters. The relationship between Auggie and Annie is fun to watch.,1376784000,,121,4.809523809523809
4480921,5,B004UXVEUS,"Well written and well acted. One of the better series I have seen. Not as good as ""24"", but still good.",1376784000,,103,3.9523809523809526
4480922,5,B004UXVEUS,It was great! The series is very intriguing and keeps guessing what is going to happen next Ready to watch the 2nd season.,1376611200,,122,4.3478260869565215
4480923,5,B004UXVEUS,"Great follow-up to Season 1 -- didn't lost ground at all, in fact I think it picked up a larger ""head of steam""!",1376611200,,112,3.9130434782608696
4480924,5,B004UXVEUS,Watched all of the first three seasons on my iPad and had never watched the show before that.  Now I have my DVR set to record,1376524800,,126,3.8461538461538463
4480925,3,B004UXVEUS,Not as captivating as a couple of the spy programs available. Characters are a bit dull. Could use some more excitement,1376524800,,119,4.714285714285714
4480926,4,B004UXVEUS,Good show lots of action good stories. Excellent High definition. I would highly recommend. The story revolves around a female CIA operative and her blind handler.,1376524800,,163,5.3076923076923075
4480927,5,B004UXVEUS,"If you're looking for an interesting action adventure tv show, this is the one! The characters are great and the mystery is just enough to keep your interest without making you nervous (although it's always nice to sit on the edge of your seat every once in a while and this show does that as well!). From the very first episode of season one I was hooked. Get to know Annie, the CIA operative who never completed her training, never uses a gun, and never fails at catching the bad guy. At least not yet. August (aka Auggie), Joan, Jay, and Arthur are definitely characters who compliment this series! Highly recommended for those who love spies!",1376438400,,646,4.577586206896552
4480928,4,B004UXVEUS,"This series is interesting to watch.  The lead character is a CIA agent, but unlike other spy series she rarely carries a gun.  Which is refreshing, since she often uses her wits as opposed to a shoot out to resolve problem situations.  Of course that's not to say that there aren't others who use guns,so bullets still fly regularly.  Even so, series has a few good twists, and often deals with some of the ethical dilemmas faced by the agents.  Good storylines.",1376438400,,463,4.597560975609756
4480929,5,B004UXVEUS,My girlfriend and I watched the first 3 seasons in two weeks. I didn't think much of it but I actually really like it. It's highly entertaining and the characters are well developed. I can't think of the agents name but she's always kicking someone's ass or she's getting saved. She's perfect for the role. The show is believable and that makes it effective and entertaining to me.,1376438400,,381,4.617647058823529
4480930,5,B004UXVEUS,This series has been fun to watch. It has both action and drama not to mention that I like all the characters.,1376438400,,110,4.045454545454546
4480931,4,B004UXVEUS,"Love the characters, and that is complex enough to be engaging, but not ridiculously involved, vulgar,or needlessly weighty or violent. Highly recommended.",1376438400,,155,6.090909090909091
4480932,5,B004UXVEUS,This is a thrilling tv series that I started watching before I cut cable off.  I use some of the money I save not paying for cable to buy this and one other tv program that I missed after I cut off cable.  To say more would be to give spoilers to those not yet invested but should try it.,1376438400,,288,3.783333333333333
4480933,5,B004UXVEUS,I was hooked after episode one and watched all three seasons in one weekend!  Great show and great characters.  Hope it continues.,1376438400,,130,4.863636363636363
4480934,4,B004UXVEUS,"Lots of spy fun for the weekly scripts; the back story is intended as an antidote to the ""007"" school of fake spy glamour.  Piper is cute and her character is unique, if not any more believable than any other CIA fiction.",1376438400,,221,4.261904761904762
4480935,4,B004UXVEUS,"Sometimes a little fluffy, but lots of very well done action stuff, too. I think I pulled one star because as the seasons go on, they have softened it a bit. First seasons are really 5 stars, though.",1376438400,,199,4.2631578947368425
4480936,5,B004UXVEUS,"I love this show because the characters are lovable. I like the suspense, I think it's witty. Love Annie and Auggie (nice twist).",1376352000,,129,4.6521739130434785
4480937,4,B004UXVEUS,"I believe the time of just action series is passed.  The public seems to be demanding these type of character-driven shows.  Covert Affairs is definitely a character-driven show.  The action is secondary.  The missions Piper Perabo's character goes on are merely the backdrop for multiple character development.

Her sister finds out she's really an operative and for the safety of the sister's children orders Annie to move out. This season reveals a maturing Annie as both person and operative, and digs deeper into the political machinations of Annie's bosses and co-workers. Twists and turns abound!",1375747200,,448,4.907894736842105

4480967,5,B004UXVEUS,"There are lots of adventures on this show, and a cast that keeps me coming back for more.  It can be funny., heavy, deadily and romantic, in one setting.

There is a lot of action but no needless violence. I highly recommend it.",1375574400,,372,4.095890410958904

4480976,3,B004UXVEUS,"OK, so it's largely empty-headed, predictable and presents a stupid picture of the CIA that is obviously not real.  Nevertheless, it's fun, has outstanding on-location filming that lets you see great cities around the world, and the acting is decent.  Plus Piper Perabo is appealing and slick.  So it's like a Twinkie: you know you shouldn't, you know you are getting zero nutrition, but you pop it into your mouth anyway.  It's just enjoyable, even if it is embarrassing to say so.",1375574400,,482,4.841463414634147

4480980,5,B004UXVEUS,I had never heard about Covert Affairs when I decided to watch it. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I raced through season 1 and am now enjoying season 2. You follow the same characters from episode to episode and get to know them. If you enjoy any type of police procedural genre television series then Covert Affairs is perfect for you.,1375401600,2,347,4.3538461538461535

4480985,5,B004UXVEUS,"For those that enjoy spy stories with a bit of interpersonal drama, this is the show.  Piper Perabo plays a young CIA operative who is in her early career of honing her spycraft.  This show is fun and adverturous.",1375228800,,213,4.435897435897436

4480989,5,B004UXVEUS,Great continuing season. I really enjoyed watching this show. The concept of a blind CIA agent is  a little unbelievable.,1375142400,,121,5.05
4480990,5,B004UXVEUS,"If you liked the first season, you'll love this one.  Once you start watching, you can't stop.  We watched to the entire set over a few days, and then we started at the beginning again -- it is that good!",1375142400,,204,4.075

4480998,5,B004UXVEUS,Surprisingly well done!  Each episode has something fresh and intriguing. Not too dark yet maintains intensity and a certain charm about the characters.,1374969600,,152,5.608695652173913
4480999,4,B004UXVEUS,I just plain like this show.  Not too serious but current and a little bit hip.  Hoping they make Annie a little bit tougher and more believable.,1374969600,,145,4.333333333333333
4481000,4,B004UXVEUS,"The actions and outlook seem accurate for a young, professional female CIA agent.  The quiet sister living behind her sister's family and the duel, action CIA hero makes interesting contrasts.",1374883200,2,192,5.4

4481003,5,B004UXVEUS,"My favorite spy movie.  Every episode isn't the same scenario, just different people, as in others we have watched.  We like the blind guy and what we learn about being blind from him.  Didn't like Jai.  Glad he is gone.",1374883200,,220,4.425

4481006,4,B004UXVEUS,"Annie Walker's character is developing into something I think is taking away from the charm and appeal of the series. Her character has not previously been presented as that of a highly skilled fighter/killer -- this is not a direction I find particularly inviting -- however, as the characters of Augie and Eyal (sp.) have matured, they have preserved the true human element that the series offered early on. While Annie seems to be developing into a hardened spy, her counterparts have remained easier to identify with. Earlier in the series and this season her belief in good and right and integrity has been replaced with jetsetting, globe trotting, and a bit of unbelieveable just hopping on a plane at her whim -- to go wherever she feels the need to go -- I find this odd as there does not seem to be an accountability -- she is now a full blown spy who operates outside of any structure. It is just not building the character the way she started -- which I did like.",1374710400,,974,4.5397727272727275
4481007,4,B004UXVEUS,"I have watched Seasons 0ne, two and three, all have been entertaining and I enjoy.  Impact, not so much - - it's just a nice CIA/SPY show and Piper Perabo does a good job in her roll. What should you know - - Its a nice show to watch!",1374710400,,234,3.7755102040816326
4481008,3,B004UXVEUS,"It is a pleasant old school spy series story line, with a strong focus on strong female leads; who's male counterparts are supportive of their ambitions and capable of bailing them out; both professionally and personally.",1374710400,,221,5.166666666666667

4481013,5,B004UXVEUS,"Like the show.  Some of the blind man items are a little beyond reality and female star always beats up here male opponent which is not very realistic.
Enjoy the show and have seen all 3 seasons on Amazon and 2 new episodes on USA.  If you haven't seen previous episodes and start with current season it would be hard to understand Arthur, Joan and Henry scheme in overall series.",1374624000,,380,4.414285714285715
4481014,4,B004UXVEUS,"While the acting and stories are adequate and mildly interesting it is the cities and countries they visit while keeping me interested enough to watch that I enjoy.  It is a pleasant little trip to take daily while I have my lunch or workout, whatever.  It is clean cut so my grandkids can be in the room and well done enough to hold my attention.  Considered a worthwhile check out.",1374624000,,383,4.442857142857143

4481017,5,B004UXVEUS,"Fun, fast moving, interesting.  Of course I realize that anything made by holywood will have stuff in it that is not realistic and makes you say, ""Whatever!"" but I find this program entertaining.  Annie needs a gun, but I like how the witers explain why she does not cary one.  However, she should at least carry a pocket Tazer. The stupidest thing in the program is her little, environmentally friendly, bright red car she uses to tail other spies.  Whatever!  Lose the car and the series will be a lot better.",1374624000,,511,4.571428571428571

4481020,5,B004UXVEUS,"I really have enjoyed this series.  A Chic series though but good.
A typical spy series, but good and exciting. No cliff hangers after each one.
I like watching the strong women and how they handle themselves both politically at the CIA or in the field.
I'm very impressed the the blind charactor on his acting and how believable he plays the blind part.
Of course the main charactor is awesome and it's fun seeing her get out of tough situations.

I recommend this to everyone.",1374451200,,478,4.546511627906977

4481027,4,B004UXVEUS,It's clearly a ripoff of NCIS. I enjoyed it for 1 1/2 seasons but the plotlines started getting too obviously predicable and formulaic.,1374364800,,135,4.913043478260869
4481028,5,B004UXVEUS,I love Covert Affairs.  I enjoy the international espionage as well as seeing a strong woman in action.  The story lines are just believable enough to wonder where they came from - actual event or imagination.,1374364800,,209,4.777777777777778
4481029,5,B004UXVEUS,"This is one of my favorite shows.  It draws you in on every episode.  Actors are great, plots are great.",1374364800,,104,4.15

4481032,5,B004UXVEUS,"Covert Affairs has become a favorite.  Watching the growth of the main character, Annie Walker, from a naive and idealistic rookie agent to a more world weary, disillusioned experienced operative is especially fascinating.  Piper Perabo has grown this character in a very realistic way and the story lines and writing continue to be intelligent, relevant and deep.  Can't wait for Season 3 and 4.",1374364800,2,396,5.15625
4481033,5,B004UXVEUS,I just started watching this show recently and have come to really enjoy it. It is a great show that keeps you wanting more/ It has its funny parts and its serious ones. I cant wait to get done with season 3.,1374364800,,208,3.9761904761904763
4481034,5,B004UXVEUS,The second season is better than the first. It is smart and entertaining and it is allowing the main character to grow into her role.,1374364800,,133,4.36
4481035,5,B004UXVEUS,"The Season2 has come out much better than Season1. Good plots, good locations and some very good video footages. What I liked most about it was continued good direction and acting by not knot the lead actors but different characters. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1374364800,,255,5.095238095238095
4481036,5,B004UXVEUS,Very entertaining! I love how she operates without a gun and thinks quick on her toes.  Clever show and great characters.,1374364800,,121,4.761904761904762
4481037,3,B004UXVEUS,"The first season of Covert Affairs was descent but my biggest complaint was that the show seemed to wrap up and complete the mission way to quickly in the end - in like the last 60 seconds of the show which seemed very anti-climactic.  The other issue I have with the main character Annie, is that she's a spy that's put in a lot of dangerous situations but never has a gun when every other spy she encounters does and is often caught up in gun fights every show.  It's a glaring short-coming or done purposely, either way it's not believable.  There is good build up to the end of the show but the way the show was scripted for the main character (Annie) to complete her mission was lacking something.  I think the show has a good premise but the writing just needs to be a little bit better. In Season 3 it appears they've gotten those better writers so it's even better than S2.  Over all it has good acting and good characters and plots but it's just missing something to put it over th top as a great show.  I don't like that they killed off a great main character this season.",1374278400,,1082,4.253658536585366
4481038,5,B004UXVEUS,"Each seasons just keeps on getting better!

This series is awesome.  As a female ""James Bond"", Annie Walker is a compelling, strong female character.  The series nicely balances action and intrigue and exotic locales with human drama around passion and emotional struggles and relationships in general.  Auggies's character is also interesting: nice to see a disabled character in a key role. And Eyal (Oded Fehr) is just about sexiest actor on tv!  What is there not to love about this series?!",1374192000,,495,5.061728395061729

4481043,4,B004UXVEUS,I like this spy drama. Not too thriller not too mystery with a healthy serving of drama. Overall a very interesting series and I can't wait for the next seasons.,1374019200,,161,4.4
4481044,3,B004UXVEUS,"I liked Season 1 much better. She was wholesome, witty, and smart. In this season she is making some poor choices to get ahead. In season 1 the people that would choose right and the people who would choose wrong were pretty obvious. Now the lines are getting blurred. I hope we will see her struggle with these poor choices as the Season progresses.",1373932800,,350,4.484375
4481045,5,B004UXVEUS,"Please watch season 1 first.  If you like twists & turns in a program, this one is for you.  If for any reason you are not happy with the way things are going, wait 10 to 15 minutes & it will change.  This is an awesome show.  It is different and very entertaining.  I love this show & have watched several episodes more than once.  I can't wait to finish season 3.  This is one of my favorite shows I would challenge anyone to take the time to watch it, you won't be disappointed.",1373932800,,481,4.053191489361702
4481046,5,B004UXVEUS,"If the heroine here has to be blonde, and there seems to be a bias in that direction on this show, at least she's bright, willing to try anything, and still manages to be vulnerable. I especially enjoy the husband/wife/boss relationships that are explored with the older characters. I'd love to see an old lady operative show up and teach the new bird a few tricks, much like the agents from other countries.",1373846400,,408,4.602739726027397
4481047,5,B004UXVEUS,Fun and riveting. Season 2 much darker and intense than season 1. I highly recommend if you like action-packed intrigue.,1373846400,,120,5.05

4481050,5,B004UXVEUS,I like Piper Perabo from coyote ugly and she does a great job with this series.  Good development of other characters also,1373760000,,122,4.545454545454546

4481055,5,B004UXVEUS,This is my new favorite show. Love how the protagonist has a quick win every episode and that there are also bigger narratives throughout the season. Like having the action without a lot of graphic violence such as in the show Homeland.,1373587200,,236,4.642857142857143
4481056,5,B004UXVEUS,A pretty decent watch for anyone looking to catch a good storyline. I'd recommend to anyone who is into action and spy stories.,1373500800,,127,4.565217391304348

4481058,4,B004UXVEUS,"Recently retired, this series is a great way to fill an hour or so.  Piper P is wonderful, and the plot twists are only obvious AFTER they have happened.  Good action, although a bit improbable given the novice state of the heroine, its still fun to watch.  Did I mention Piper? Yeah, I guess I did.",1373500800,,299,4.303571428571429

4481062,5,B004UXVEUS,"At first I was skeptical that this show would be worth my time, but I like Piper Perabo so I started watching.  Turns out to be a really fun and pretty darned good show.  I'm well into season 2 now and can't stop my marathon watching.  Been hitting a couple of shows each evening that I'm able to get to the TV.  I don't know how the CIA really operates, but I can imagine the internal politics and rivalry between divisions is fairly close to what really happens.  Fun show.",1373500800,,475,4.233333333333333
4481063,4,B004UXVEUS,Piper P. seems to get every new assignment of every CIA problematic mission despite not (yet) finishing THE FARM.  But somehow it comes together as enjoyable diversion from our workaday lives.,1373414400,,192,5.193548387096774

4481065,3,B004UXVEUS,Actors are good. Augie is the best. Piper does an excellent job with some scripts that give her silly lines. As to realism... no way. This is not how it is done. Even though the CIA works domestically in violation of law... not done this way. The show does a good job with locations. Not all sound stage. Please change the chintzy take off on a Bond movie intro.,1373328000,,362,4.260869565217392

4481070,5,B004UXVEUS,I enjoy women in action films and Kate woods is excellent in all three seasons. I like this so much I bought the DVD. I could watch this movie many times. There is plenty of action and each episode is a similar to the previous so you know where they left off. Again a great show.,1373328000,,279,4.0

4481073,3,B004UXVEUS,"I generally liked the show, however the main characters tendency to constantly ignore the rules goes a bit overboard.  I like the pushing back, but reminds me of a stubborn child sometimes.

4481076,1,B004UXVEUS,"Annie's character become annoyance rather than great. Her actions where she defies her CIA boss is nonsense. Her escape from Russian jail with Mossad is stupid, ridiculous.

4481078,3,B004UXVEUS,"I got hooked on Covert Affairs because of Annie's relationship with Ben, but in Seaason 2, nothing happens with Ben.  All of the rest of the story and the action was basically the same as any other spy show, but there was no believeable romance in sight.  I think the most interesting episode was the finale, but this season was just okay for me.",1372982400,,346,4.390625

I like spy/drama tv shows and movies and this is the perfect program for anyone that also likes this type of show. I love the Auggie and Annie characters, they are perfect for their interaction.

4481088,5,B004UXVEUS,"I really enjoyed this series. The plots don't require much viewer attention, so it's fun to kick back and just watch good old spy stuff. My guess is that the most realistic parts of the shows are what goes on in the CIA offices, and the interplay with the politicians and the  Washington power brokers. Of course there's plenty of chases, shootings, and mayhem to keep things moving, and the stars are pretty good looking! (Go Annie Walker!)",1372636800,,441,4.653846153846154

4481091,4,B004UXVEUS,"Annie Walker is a new CIA covert agent who gets involved in international assignments. As typical of this genre, she is not very respectful of authority and often acts beyond her orders. Annie has a close and increasingly romantic involvement with her handler, Auggie, who used to be a special ops officer who was blinded from an explosion. The episodes are generally well written, with multiple themes involving the various characters.

Plus: interesting characters and relationships, international locations (probably mostly green screened, but still adds interest).
Cons: as expected, a bit implausible at times. Not nearly as complex as a show like AMC's ""The Killing"" but good for the USA Network.",1372636800,,702,5.324324324324325
4481092,2,B004UXVEUS,"The love angles are beginning to overshadow the show, which is not good.

She has it all-exceptional talent-  bright-very beautiful and her 'timing' is perfect. All the characters are superb performers espicially Anderson (Auggie), blinded in war, with a compensating exceptional brain who keeps an amazing 'hand"" on complex CIA affairs.

4481110,3,B004UXVEUS,"Typical made for TV fair. What trained covert officer would knockout the bad guys and walk away leaving they're weapons behind ?

4481112,4,B004UXVEUS,I am enjoying this series.  It is not as heavy and full of violence as many spy shows.  It is a fairly light way to enjoy some spy action.,1372204800,,138,3.7241379310344827

4481119,2,B004UXVEUS,"Alias was a great show and Covert Affairs uses that same formula but poor writing, the lack of a decent ongoing plot and heavy reliance on cliched, girl-power pandering leads to at least a half dozen ""why am I watching this"" moments per episode.",1371945600,,245,4.590909090909091

4481136,3,B004UXVEUS,"It is enjoyable to watch when you just want to zone-out & take it easy. The plots & characterizations are okay for TV, and of course all the actors are attractive & the bad guys are definitely bad. What else could you want went you're looking for a little escapism?",1371340800,,265,4.32
4481137,5,B004UXVEUS,This show continues to amaze me with the very well crafted plots and excellent writing.  Piper Perabo as Annie Walker continues to steal the show.,1371340800,,146,4.84

4481140,4,B004UXVEUS,"Seems semi-realistic based on what I know of that world.  The folks live a fancy lifestyle, though, but they don't make the income to support that which speaks to their dedication to the mission.",1371340800,,195,4.735294117647059

4481149,1,B004UXVEUS,"not exactly a smart thriller, more like a soap opera gone spy, too many characters making retarded choices to force the plot along. hard to stomach. main character is not bad looking but that's about all this show's got going for it.",1371081600,,233,4.571428571428571

4481156,5,B004UXVEUS,"This show reminds me a bit of Alias, but more episodic and light-hearted without the wired occult/sci-fi aspect. Highly recommended viewing.",1371081600,,140,5.714285714285714
4481157,5,B004UXVEUS,"The perfect show for binge watching on a lazy day. Annie and Augie always provide entertainment and adventure. Long term story lines add texture to the weekly episodes. It is unlike other shoot-em-up spy stories as  Annie uses her head and her skills whenever possible. Moral issues abound in a realistic manner: how foes Annie tell her sister that she is an operative?  What is patriotism and what is politics? How does ambition drive choices? Piper Perabo plays it all with a heart melting smile and lightening fast reflexes. The CIA couldn't have better publicity.

Annie is loyal, smart, compassionate and deadly when neccesary. Light but very satisfying fare!",1370908800,,664,5.073394495412844
4481158,5,B004UXVEUS,"Love her, and Alia lady. Very gung ho and confidant. covert government shows are awesome. I wander how far from the truth they are?",1370649600,,131,4.5
4481159,5,B004UXVEUS,The second season  really starts to develop the characters. Annie's  confidence sky rockets  and her missions get more complicated. Overall it is a  fun and entertaining ride.,1370649600,,175,5.37037037037037
4481160,4,B004UXVEUS,"Series gets better with Annie getting all the plum assignments but still full of the improbable such as Annie outrunning the bad guys, shooting and high speed car chases. But, just relax and suspend judgement, and it is an mindless adventure.  Chris Gorman is HOT! Irritated that Amazon allows me two full seasons, then after I'm really into it, charges for the third season. Cry foul!",1370649600,,385,4.833333333333333
4481161,5,B004UXVEUS,"I think this show should be on a channel . If its Is convert affairs should be advertised more! I love watching the show, great series!",1370649600,,135,4.230769230769231
4481162,5,B004UXVEUS,I would love to see Annie back with Ben mercer since Simon was killed off.  I hope they bring him back once in a while so they can rekindle the burning fire of their relationship.  Auggie is a hard sell for me because once you cross the line between friends how can he be a good handler without getting emotionally involved. I think they need to prolong the sexual tension between these two characters.  These are just my opinions thank you.,1370563200,,441,4.419753086419753
4481163,5,B004UXVEUS,"Loved this show! Can't wait till next season! Amazing at how all the Agents are trained!  Sorry about her personal life, though.  Not being able to be there for her sister like she wants.",1370476800,,187,4.470588235294118

4481169,5,B004UXVEUS,"I can't wait for the next season 4 to come out. I wish that season three was available to me on my prime network, but if you like shows about the cia, fbi, ncis any of those crime shows. This is a must see.

4481172,5,B004UXVEUS,This is the best drama undercover show I have seen in a while.  Its very captivating.  I know I just cannot wait for next season to cxme out!  I reccommed thiis show to everyone who enjoys the likes of Law & Order and CSI and Criminal Minds.  It is right up there with the best.,1370044800,,278,4.0

4481174,4,B004UXVEUS,"Cover Affairs is one of the best spy tv series since ""Burn Notice"".  With a female to take the lead as the hero, Annie doesn't disappoint to put her skills and good looks to work.

Cover Affairs is a must-see!  100%",1369785600,,215,4.195121951219512
4481175,5,B004UXVEUS,"At first I thought this was going to be a remake of Alias with a less than stellar cast. But I was wrong. Its a different plot and our heroine is not as supper human as Sydney Bristow which  is a good twist. The political intrigue has also been well done. This is a good cast. And Piper, well what can you say, she is not just another pretty face.",1369785600,,347,3.9571428571428573

4481185,4,B004UXVEUS,"Covert Affairs is a fun spy-thriller series with engaging characters, but the spy-craft and action scenes are sometimes contrived and a bit fantastical even for television. The scenery and filming on location in various places around the world is a nice diversion.

Amazon Instant Video is convenient for storing content, and the HD quality on my 32"" Samsung LCD TV is very good, but I'm not a big fan of the glitchy SEEK, FAST-FORWARD, and REWIND controls that are part of the video streaming world.

Season 3 isn't out on CD yet and probably won't be until May or June of 2013, but I watched it online as it unfolded.

The story has progressed well from the start in Season 1 and it's exciting to see the love interest grow between the 2 main characters - Annie & Augie. If you enjoy spy thrillers and the interaction between people thrown into different situations, requiring all sorts of intervention to save them, then you will really enjoy Covert Affairs. In Australia, it has just started running from the beginning again and even though I have Season 1, I look forward to watching each weekly episode - actually I watch them twice......

4481200,5,B004UXVEUS,Its real interesting to see what a special agent goes through.  Keeping secrets of your job from your family members and keeping them safe at the same timeis a lot of work especially emotionally.  I wonder how many directives are thwarted.  I find it odd that a agent that goes against protocol isn't fired. I don't know if I could sleep with the enemy.  I do like the relationship with Annie and Augie. Glad to see it come back for another season.  Also like the theme music.,1358640000,,476,4.425287356321839

I would recommend it for anyone that enjoys a more real feeling to the characters and less superman invincibility. Another positive aspect is the balance of humor and action. This is not all action (James Bond) nor all humor (Austin Powers).",1358467200,,386,4.5285714285714285
4481202,5,B004UXVEUS,"I am thoroughly pleased with this series!, although I must admit that I thought it would be cheezy when I bought it. I was really in an experament with myself to test out some of the more recent series on TV. I don't watch tv because of the stinking commercials. They are getting longer and more frequent than I care to watch.
Anyway, Piper Parabo totally blew me away. She could be one of the better actresses on the up and comming scene. I really like the fact that, while she can play a very vulnerable and sweet, kind, and caring person in one scene, then Kick some real BUTT in the next. She pulls it off with precision timing.
Christopher Gorham is great as well. He really looks like he is blind, and he has such a sincere way of caring about Piper's well being, while being able to pull off a believable tough and sinister side to him as well.
Keri Matchet is a sweetheart, but carries the weight of a leading, make the tough decisions, kind of a real woman. She is probable, for me one of the most sexy women on the screen today, without being cheap or sleezy. I just love her character as well.
Sendhil Ramamurthy does a great job as well.
And last, but not least, Peter Gallagher is a likable character with the ability to pull off the tough decision - maker role well.

The only problem is paying so much to watch what is on free TV.  These programs should be 49 cents an episode.  Let's get real Amazon, you're making money.  I'd watch more if your pricing was better.  Also your platform should be integrated.  Do I really need two clouds?  And why doesn't my changes on the Kindle sync with the cloud?

4481229,5,B004UXVEUS,"Having watched season one of ""Covert Affairs"", there was no doubt in my mind that I had to have season two.  Actress Piper Perabo is perfect for the part of Annie.  Christopher Gorham, Sendhil Ramamurthy, Anne Dudek, Kari Matchett and Peter Gallagher are perfect for their parts as well.  This show features a great cast, adventure, danger, intrigue and romance.  ""Covert Affairs"" goes one step beyond all of that by making relationships with family and friends real and important.  Each CIA character has the opportunity to portray a little bit of their personal side outside of their job.  A nice contrast to the danger and intrigue aspect of the show.",1341792000,2,654,4.9

4481231,4,B004UXVEUS,"Boos and hisses on Amazon for not having the show's catchy title track (Power's ""Can You Save Me"") available as an MP3 download. And that may (or may not) be the only negative thing I say here, because COVERT AFFAIRS, one of USA Network's entries in the sub-genre of spy thriller lite, is must-see television in my household. Piper Perabo continues to be compelling as the CIA's latest recruit Annie Walker. As we learned in Season One's first episode, her director has no qualms in immediately plunging her in deep waters, one field assignment chased by another. I am madly in crush with Piper Perabo, and I figure her unusual and catchy name has something to do with it. But there's also that slightly offbeat vibe she's got going on. And I've said this elsewhere, but, man, her face is so expressive and she exudes smarts.

I dunno if this is fact or fiction, but it's established early in the show that the CIA's hiring freeze unfroze after 9/11, which has resulted in 50% of the agency now flaunting a mere 5 years of experience or less. Factor in that Annie placed tops in her spy training class, and maybe the director's decision to deploy Annie so soon is easier to comprehend. In Season 2 Chris Gorham demonstrates that he still flexes those ridiculous abs. Peter Gallagher still parades around with those two pet caterpillars he insists are eyebrows. Season 2 still has me singing along to the catchy theme song. And Season 2 finds Annie Walker less broken-hearted and more the seasoned spy, although she hasn't all the way shed her wide-eyed innocence; she's yet to develop that guarded, cynical shell. But her instincts have been on point from jump. She keeps getting the job done (well, mostly), even if she sometimes steps outside of proper agency protocol. Some may frown at her insubordination. But others may flip that around and call it ""showing initiative"" and ""adapting to adverse situations.""

We see what happens to her recently turned-up mystery man, that ex-boyfriend for whom she annoyingly pined for most of last season. That's not to say that her other admirers don't get spotlighted. In ""Good Advices"" Annie and Mossad agent Eyal Lavin (Oded Fehr, awesome) run into each other and butt heads over a prospective asset, and in ""A Girl Like You"" Lavin returns to Washington, D.C. on an unsanctioned (and personal) mission. And there are other dudes sniffing around.

Okay, the writing could be sharper, and, honestly, I'm not that into the shady internal politics that go on within the CIA. But the appealing cast and the breezy, upbeat tone help make the show very easy to swallow. Piper Perabo is never less than captivating. She anchors the show effortlessly. I hope this is her breakout role and that she gets more pub out of this, because I think she's talented and deserving. Meanwhile, I'm crossing my fingers for something to develop even more between Annie and her trusted pal Auggie (Chris Gorham). Perabo and Gorham together create serious sparks, but it's probably best that whatever it is they've got going on, it unfolds at a slow burn. By the way, Gorham's blind CIA tech wrangler just may be the best character in the show. Maybe my favorite Season 2 episodes is ""Half a World Away,"" in which Auggie's jazz festival jaunt in Istanbul inadvertently turns into an espionage mission. In this ep, it's revealed how Auggie lost his eyesight.

And, as always, we note the dichotomy between Annie's CIA capers and her sometimes frazzled domestic life with her sister. Season 1 ended with Danielle (Anne Dudek) still believing Annie's Smithsonian cover. In Season 2, cue certain developments.

COVERT AFFAIRS isn't as nerve-jangling or action-packed as 24, isn't as plot-twisty as ALIAS, and our heroine doesn't boast the experience and jadedness of Michael Westen on BURN NOTICE. It tends to be episodic in nature, which results in our not caring that much about the caper of the week. But COVERT AFFAIRS finds a nice balance in showcasing the more glamorous, globe-trotting, adventurous side of Annie's missions with those other assignments in which she deals with the more mundane aspects of the job. I think of all the things that COVERT AFFAIRS isn't, and I'm even more amazed that this show steadily hooks in its share of the Nielsen pie. Piper Perabo is pitch perfect. And it's always neat to discover what other language Annie Walker has mastered. Just as with BONES and with CASTLE, it's not so much the cases as it is the interactions among the cast members that draw us in. And, finally, it's good to see Auggie's close combat sessions with Annie paying off huge. The Season 3 opener is just around the corner, on July 10th. I may fidget anxiously until then.

The COVERT AFFAIRS Season 2 set consists of all 16 episodes on four discs and the following special features: several deleted scenes, a gag reel, Piper's introduction of the series at Comic-Con 2011, and a behind-the-scenes featurette entitled ""Covert Affairs On Location.""",1341360000,15,4978,4.850588235294118

*Gag Reel (short and funny!! Piper has a mouth on her, but it's all censored out.)
*Piper Perabo Comic-Con Intro (Kinda confusing, I thought that this would be an interview or something but it's a funny gag with Annie going off task at Comic Con following ""intel"". Eh, short and a little pointless.)
*Covert Affairs on Location: Istanbul, Venice, Berlin, and Stockholm (Probably the best bonus feature of this box set, it follows Chris Gorham who plays Auggie Anderson as he goes on location and shoots little video diaries and behind the scene snippets of his costars. Interesting and personal, I felt a part of the Covert Affairs family by watching it. Roughly 16 minutes with all of them.)

Unfortunately, the one thing that this box set is missing is the cast and creator commentaries on certain episodes. I love those best, because I love to hear what little nuggets of wisdom the actors have and reminisce on. It's odd that this set offers nothing of the sort this time around, especially when practically every other TV show I have encountered has at least one episode like that, but the COVERT AFFAIRS ON LOCATION definitely helped my bummed feeling on the matter.

Although you always know that things will turn out okay in the end, the road getting there is often slick, slippery, and filled with twists and turns.  The characters are appealing and the dialog is contemporary without sounding like a junior high schooler's tweet. The starring and supporting casts are very good and include a long-time favorite of mine, Peter Gallagher.  A number of episodes during season two were shot abroad, adding to the adventure of the show.

4481255,5,B004UXVEUS,This is action packed! I love the backstories and learning about each character. I love the small town girl meets big time CIA. It's great.,1331683200,5,139,4.6
4481256,4,B004UXVEUS,"This show shoould dig deeper into the reality of the CIA but what can you expect from a tv show. It does better than most though even though the show has a light tone to it. I belive the writers should make the show a bit heavier so it is a little more believable or real, sometimes it gets so light it reminds me of Glee. If they took some tips from the writers of Burn Notice this show has some great potential. It is very entertaining as it is and one of my favorite shows and this episode was not a bad way to end the season however it couldve been a bit more dramatic seeing how the show is based off the CIA, the most famous of the 16 intelligence community agency/offices of the U.S. So with this subject matter as a base for the show, the writers need to make it a little bit more real life. I am impressed that they use correct CIA termanology and Geographic termanology most of the time. This shows they did a good job of researching for the show. They need to not let this research go to waste and they need to add weight to the show. It also sometimes reminds me CSI Miami but CIA instead. Covert Affairs is good but has the potential to become great. On another note Amazon needs to manage their downloading tools better but watching the show streaming online is almost flawless.",1330300800,,1292,4.213709677419355
4481257,5,B004UXVEUS,"I picked up Covert Affairs on a whim.  I'm a long time La Femme Nikita, Nikita, Alias, Buffy fan, so the female spy with ninja skills and a heart of gold story line is one that I have enjoyed, but one that now has a pretty high standard to live up to.  Piper Perabo is simply a pleasure to watch in this role, from start to finish.  She pretty much had me twisted around her little pinky a few episodes in when I realized that she had the power to go from funny to heartbreaking in a few moments.  I've really enjoyed Christopher Gorham since ""Jake 2.0"", and seeing him here is not unlike seeing him in that role again--a computer wise spy guy.  The trick here is that he is blind, but every bit as deadly and capable as his sighted companions.  The evolving relationship between Perabo and Gorham on screen kept me coming back in season 1, and in season 2 it just gets better.  Annie and Auggie make perfect friends and foils, their banter and friendship are the secret to what makes this show great.  The moment in episode 7 when we learn more about Auggie's blindness...well, I'll leave you hopefully wondering.  Jump on the Covert Affairs train.  It's a great ride and a lot of fun.",1325808000,80,1186,4.35
4481258,5,B004UXVEUS,"There may be inconsistencies...and sure, sometimes the spycraft is a bit far fetched...but this is a USA show.  It's about the characters!  This Auggie-centric episode finally answers the question of: How did he become blind?  It really is a heart wrenching story.  You see the character in a light that you really only got to glimpse at before.  His friendship with Annie is put to the test and at the end of the episode you really get a sense of how close these two have become.  Whether the writers put them together in a romantic sense or not...it's one of the best relationships out there.  The final scene with Auggie and Annie at Allen's Tavern is enough to make even the most hardened person cry.  The use of Gaslight Anthem's ""We Did It When We Were Young"" is inspired.  One of the best episodes yet.

I absolutely love this show and have a growing respect for USA and their development team.  If you want to get to know the characters you're watching NOT necessarily care about the missions...then really, you can't go wrong with Covert Affairs.  It's fun.  I can't wait for the 2nd half of the 2nd Season in November. :)",1315180800,,1131,4.53960396039604

4481260,5,B004UXVEUS,"I started watching Covert Affairs on Hulu and moved over to Amazon Instant to fulfill my addiction to this spy show. Seriously, take my word when I say this show is Awesome! I jumped in during Season 2 watching free shows on Hulu during the summer lull in quality TV programming, and found myself jumping to Amazon to catch up on back episodes. I'm surprised that this show pulled me in. I thought nothing could compare to Kiefer Sutherland and the exciting action involved in every episode of 24's action drama. Piper Perabo nails her role as the lead spy on Covert Affairs. My other favorite characters are Ben Mercer (Eion Bailey who is super hot), Jai Wilcox (Sendhil Ramamurthy from Heros) and Auggie Anderson (Christopher Gorham). I hope USA Network keeps producing Covert Affairs for a long time.",1314835200,3,803,4.784172661870503

8442497,2,B004UXVEUS,Horrible writing!  And the actor that plays Annie is HORRIBLE as well!  I think if they had someone that wasn't so doe-eyed and dumb looking the show would've been better!  The best episodes for me is when she's shot and put in a Russian gulag!!  She ruined the show for me.,1524873600,,274,4.313725490196078

Nice to see a series where the lead actress/actor is not sleeping with a different person on each episode.
