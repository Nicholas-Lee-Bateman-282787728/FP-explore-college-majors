8532632,5,B008YRL6Y0,"This movie is charming. The leads are so likeable you are rooting for them all the way to the end.  From first meeting to long married couple, they are so sweet and obviously in love. The costuming is colorful and the ""super-villains"" in the beginning of the film are hilarious.  Unlike some other martial arts films, the balance of humor, romance and fighting is perfect.  If you liked ""Shaolin Soccer"", you should definitely give ""Incredibly Ever After"" a viewing.",1359244800,2,466,4.8734177215189876
8532633,4,B008YRL6Y0,"When it comes to Chinese New Year, one thing that you can always look forward to are the Chinese New Year comedies.

Quite often they are more miss than hit, but once in awhile, you do find gems and one of those gems from 2011 was ""Mr. & Mrs. Incredible"" (or ""Incredibly Ever After"") directed by Vincent Kok (""Gorgeous"", ""Shaolin Soccer"", ""CJ7) and co-written by Kok and Min Hun Fung (""Kung Fu Hustle"", ""CJ7, ""Shaolin Soccer"").  And the film would star veteran talent Louis Koo (""Election"", ""Accident"", ""Love on the Rocks"") and Sandra Ng (""Jiang Hu: The Triad Zone"", ""Juliet in Love"", ""All's Well Ends Well"" films).

VIDEO:

""Incredibly Ever After"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (169).  The film utilizes a mix of live action and CG and picture quality for the film was very good.  The details of Gazer Warrior and Aroma Woman's outfit was nicely done, the use of CG especially when it came to the superhuman abilities was also well-done and definitely has that humor that we saw in Vincent Kok's previous films such as ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""CJ7.  I think the only scene where it gets a bit too cartoony with the use of CG was when they showed a mouse near the martial arts arena or a fly pestering Flint.  But other than that, picture quality for the film was very good.  I didn't notice any banding issues, artifacts or anything terrible.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Incredibly Ever After"" is presented in Cantonese Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  I did notice the action scenes utilizing the surround channels and LFE quite a bit (mostly towards the end of the film) but also utilization of the musical score through the surround channels as well.  While not completely immersive, the overall lossless soundtrack is good.  For those wondering if there is an English dub, there is none.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Incredibly Ever After"" comes with four hilarious trailers: Policy, Big Fish, Standard and Special skills

EXTRAS:

""Incredibly Ever After"" comes with a slipcover case and includes both the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to Hong Kong films, especially New Years films, they tend to be humorous, crazy and while appropriate for the New Year and to watch with family who celebrate the Chinese New Year, for many Westerners, some view these films as hit and miss.  Most often, the latter.

But it helps when you have a filmmaker like Vincent Kok and writer Min Hun Fung.  Both have worked on hit films such as ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""CJ7 and granted, despite working with talented actor Stephen Chow, the two have a nack with working on films that utilize CG special effects and creating feel-good films that do well in the box office and are entertaining.

With ""Incredibly Ever After"", the two take on a superhero film.  What happens when two superheroes quit, get married and try to live normal lives?

Yes, it may seem very similar to Disney's ""The Incredibles"", thus the use of the the title in Hong Kong, ""Mr. & Mrs. Incredible"", but despite the similarities, there are no children and the setting of the film is possibly China during the 1920s or 30s and an alternate China where some people have super abilities and such.

But what I enjoyed about the film is that it brings together two of my favorite talents in Hong Kong cinema.  Louis Koo, the tanned actor who can play either playboy, hero or villain and Sandra Ng, known for playing deep emotional roles but also can take on comedy.

While any other film, I can't picture the two together, for ""Incredibly Ever After"", their chemistry work remarkably well.  Typically Louis Koo looks like a man who never ages, but in this case, both are at equal level and their characters work for this film.

But I loved how both characters try their best to mask their abilities.  People in the village are shocked that Flint can't read small things so close but they have to fly things on a kite and he can read small type nearly a mile away, while Rouge is scared of bugs and when she tries to smash one, she nearly causes a tremor.

Both characters are naive but they love each other and despite not having fights like normal couple, it's interesting to see how these two couples start to find their relationship in jeopardy when jealousy rears its ugly head.

But ""Incredibly Ever After"" is not only a film about a relationship of a couple, there is also another side to the story that deals with an evil presence in the village during the martial arts tournament.  While predictable of who the antagonist will be, its the special ability that surprises of that person which is fascinating and definitely will bring Gazer Warrior and Aroma Woman out of retirement.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is very good and the lossless audio is also well-done.  Not entirely immersive but dialogue is crystal clear and there is good use of the surround channels and LFE during the action heavy scenes.  As for special features, you get four trailers which is not anything major and for those hoping for an English dub, surprisingly, FUNimation didn't include one.

Overall, ""Incredibly Ever After"" is probably one of the better Chinese New Year films that I have seen in my many decades of watching Hong Kong cinema.  From costume design to production/set design, I also love the use of action, comedy and special effects.  But I also enjoyed this chemistry between Louis Koo and Sandra Ng.  Both did a wonderful job in this film!

If you are looking for a Hong Kong action film that is not too serious, not too violent but has a good amount of comedy and superhero action, ""Incredibly Ever After"" is worth checking out!",1354233600,2,5635,4.706122448979592
