8046422,4,B00079W8UO,"I love that this Pilates video is filmed outside near the ocean.  Juliana Afram leads you through a one-on-one basic Pilates session where she carefully explains the positioning of your body during each of the movements.  She gives you time to change positions and explains the benefits of each exercise.  The music is nice and appropriate for the calming environment.  My only criticism is on the video shooting. Juliana's skin tones were not captured properly and during a few of the shots, her face and legs are two completely different skin tones.  I recommend this dvd if you are a beginner to Pilates and want a thorough, calming introduction led by a professional.",1332547200,,671,4.902654867256637
8046423,5,B00079W8UO,"I was very pleased with this DVD.  Juliana Afram gives a very calm, peaceful feeling to this routine.  There is a very nice warm-up before the routine.  The routine itself is very good, although you should have prior pilates experience as she does not go in-depth into the teaching of each pose.  She does explain each pose well enough to learn it, however.  The pace is pretty slow and easy.  Very nice seaside background and music is very pleasing.  There are separate tracks for convenience of use.

Very fun routine covering beginning and intermediate levels.",1130889600,4,563,4.852631578947369
