2884340,2,B000SFOY7W,"I am a recent wiggly fanatic...well, at least my 16 month old daughter is.  She loves to jump and dance and sing with the wiggles, but this DVD held her attention for exactly 30 seconds.  It is way too old for their normal target audience.  I didn't really like the backgrounds too much either, digital everything just looks corny to me.  This is a great addition for the older child who needs to learn these things before pre-school, but for iddy biddy's it's best to pop in the big red car again.",1192752000,3,498,4.380434782608695
2884341,2,B000SFOY7W,"My 18 month old loves the Wiggles, but this DVD is very slow and boring. The songs are slow and the action is not very action oriented.  I realize they were going for a learning bit this time, but I still think they missed the mark with this DVD.",1192665600,,246,4.020408163265306
2884342,3,B000SFOY7W,"We were so excited to see the first DVD with Sam featured.  It is educational but too boring for younger viewers.  My son is 2 and loved Wiggling around the Clock, Sailing, and Toot Toot probably because they have so much singing.  Getting Strong is a lot of talking.  It reminds me of Sesame Street and would probably be most appropriate for 4 yrs. and older.  The DVD is well done- nice costumes and backgrounds.  Has some favorite Wiggly Dancers and many new dancers, band players, and children.",1192492800,4,498,4.6022727272727275
2884343,5,B000SFOY7W,"I bought Getting Strong for my 2 year old son who is a huge Wiggles Fan. We have all of the DVDs that are out. I was afraid that Getting Strong was going to tank with him because this is the first DVD with Sam as the yellow Wiggle.  To my surprise it is a big hit. Not only with my 2 year old but with my 4 year old. Finally a DVD that they both agree on.
Getting Strong is not like any other Wiggle DVD. Each Wiggle has an equal part in the singing and dancing. You actually hear Jeff sing!!!! It is colorful and has very catchy songs.  This DVD also is very educational. The Wiggles teach colors, letters, shapes and letter sounds. The seem to have focused on education then song this go around. Not to say the songs are not cute as always.
For those who attended Wiggle World at Six Flags, these are the songs that were playing on all of the rides.
Very cute! Way to go!",1191888000,24,873,4.011494252873563

2884352,3,B000SFOY7W,"This is a learning DVD for older children, not a collection of the Wiggles simple songs. I read from another reviewer that this was the case for this DVD, but it truly is one that my kids will have to wait to watch. We purchased this DVD because our 15 month old boys LOVE the Wiggles songs from Yummy Yummy, Wiggle Time, Taking Off, etc. Although there are a few songs on here that held the kids' attention, many times they would walk out of the room because the learning segments were beyond their comprehension and attention span. I am sure in a year or so they will find this DVD exciting. I rated it a three stars for the inability to get my kids involved like the other Wiggles DVD's. If I remember, I will update this review more fairly when I know the kids are old enough to understand the content.",1401148800,3,806,4.2745098039215685
2884353,5,B000SFOY7W,loves it!!  Songs are pretty catchy and the dancing is definitely a work out!  One of the few disks from the new wiggles thats up to par!,1390348800,,137,4.037037037037037
2884354,5,B000SFOY7W,We love this DVD. It has such great toddler Wiggles dancing music that the parents love so much. We don't mind our 3 yr old don wanting to play it over and over.,1389484800,,161,3.909090909090909
2884355,5,B000SFOY7W,"My little brother enjoys any DVD made by the wiggles so of course, he loved this! I also don't mind listening to their music. I find their songs catchy and sometimes, I dance alongside my little brother. It was worth it:)",1380758400,,221,4.414634146341464

2884357,5,B000SFOY7W,This DVD was great!  My 6 yr. old grandson wanted it & we have played it over and over all summer.  It is educational & lots of fun with dancing & toe-tapping.,1376956800,,159,3.9375
2884358,4,B000SFOY7W,"Entertaining and keeps youngsters busy.
I like that gets kids motivated to move around and not sit on butss all day.
With ALL The Garbage Food out there and little time to exercise, kids need all help they can get.",1374451200,,214,4.375
2884359,5,B000SFOY7W,Great dvd. My Granddaughter loves the Wiggles and has watched this dvd over and over..I highly recommend it for anyone with small children.,1372032000,,139,5.086956521739131
2884360,5,B000SFOY7W,"Even if there are repeats here, the order is different, the scenarios are different, therefore, these are great investments.  I've found too that when these DVD's are played on a high-tech CD player, it will play them; so the children then use their imagination to visualize what they are hearing.",1371254400,3,297,4.94
2884361,5,B000SFOY7W,"This 2012 release is from the Wiggle's TV show ""Wiggle and Learn."" It's with Sam Wiggle, not Greg. The image and sound is bright and clean and high-resolution widescreen.  If you see descriptions on Amazon or elsewhere, do not be deceived. There was an error on the package, which lists it as only the ""Getting Strong"" episode, clocking in at 40 minutes with 14 songs. In actuality we get a second episode of Wiggle and Learn focusing on language and literacy, which is really very good as well. So its about an hour and a half of content. ""Wiggle and Learn"" is a selection of music videos, vignettes and instructional segments about reading and so forth, all performed in front of a green-screen with surreal, bright, vivid computer generated backdrops. I like this format, which a lot of Wiggles videos seem to follow- a variety show style, with a mixture of material to keep things interesting.  The group is at the peak of their powers and Sam does a darn good job, too. Well done Sammy!
 He does a fine job! It turns out I had all these feelings of anger about (original Yellow Wiggle) Greg's illness, and I turned them on poor Sam! Who knew! Sorry, Sam.",1363305600,5,1159,4.5625
2884362,5,B000SFOY7W,A wonderful DVD by the Wiggles. My boys love the songs and they also dance with the Wiggles. One of our favorites.,1355097600,,114,4.2272727272727275
2884363,1,B000SFOY7W,"Terrible!
Songs are boring.
Definitely not one of their better ones for sure.
My son loves them but gets nothing out of thid DVD.
Sorry guys.",1338595200,,141,4.461538461538462
2884364,5,B000SFOY7W,My 2 year old loves the Wiggles.  This video fits perfectly in our Wiggles collection.  He watches it all the time.,1338595200,,115,4.428571428571429

2884367,5,B000SFOY7W,"Bought this DVD for my 2yr old son's birthday.  He LOVES it!  If you watch the Wiggles on weekday mornings on Sprout, you will recognize the content of this DVD.  I love it for taking with us when we travel.  My son still gets his Wiggles just like we were at home.  Overall, a great DVD.",1313193600,,288,4.071428571428571
2884368,5,B000SFOY7W,"My child received this DVD for Christmas and LOVES it!!  We watched it over and over and over again all day on Christmas and my child has not tired of it yet.  I love how there are almost two different videos in one.  The first part of ""Getting Strong"" is about movement and the second part is about language and literacy.  There is a lot of learning going on in this DVD.  My child loves The Wiggles and has been a fan since turning a year old.  Even though my child got a couple other new Wiggles DVD's for Christmas, when given the choice my child chooses Getting Strong.  There are lots of color and catchy tunes that make this DVD a toddler's favorite!  This DVD really encourages children to get up and move and highlights wiggling and learning together.  I highly recommend The Wiggles ""Getting Strong"" if your child loves music, dancing, movement, and learning!!",1294963200,,870,4.5256410256410255
2884369,5,B000SFOY7W,"This was my 16 month old's first Wiggles DVD.  We have since purchased 3 other and this one is mine and my son's favorite.  I love the skits and the songs that then reinforce the skit.  The colors in the background are bright and fun and I feel like my son is learning while he watches this DVD.  After watching this DVD I was somewhat disappointed with the older DVDs, while they are fun and the songs are great I don't feel that they are educational.  So if you want your kid to learn and have fun this a great DVD.",1226275200,,517,4.079207920792079
2884370,3,B000SFOY7W,We have over 10 videos. This one gets a B in my book. My 2 years olds are just starting to dance and move to it. I think they will like it more when they get older.,1225670400,,164,3.4594594594594597
2884371,5,B000SFOY7W,Both my children (age 5 and 18 months) love this video.  I will also admit that I find Captain Feathersword pretty hilarious!,1221696000,,125,4.681818181818182
2884372,3,B000SFOY7W,....Sam needs more of those voice lessons (he really is seeing a voice coach...so that he can learn to sing with a more appealing timber and with less vibrato). That voice coach is the same one that helped Greg Page to develop his singing voice. It may take Sam a while to do the same thing. It's harder to unlearn than it is to learn.,1220832000,,335,4.1692307692307695
2884373,1,B000SFOY7W,"This is by far the worst Wiggles DVD.  The songs are not interesting, not catchy and the entire DVD is by far the most boring Wiggles DVD in our collection.  The songs also sound poorly recorded, the vocals are way in the background, arrangements are bad, not many wiggly dancers, this DVD completely is a waste of money.  Pick up Top of the Tots (2004) and you'll see a big difference in the production/recording, and well thought out music.  I hope they are not this bad in concert.",1214956800,,484,4.465909090909091
2884374,5,B000SFOY7W,"I have been teaching my son sign language since he was little, and this DVD has the option to turn on sign language. He has picked up signs from the DVD! It's fun, engaging, and it really gets my son (2 years old) moving and exercising.",1214611200,,236,4.1521739130434785
2884375,5,B000SFOY7W,"This dvd became an instant hit with my 3-year old.  I thought nothing would replace her old Wiggles dvds but I couldn't have been more wrong.  Although she wants to know why Greg isn't there, she has accepted Sam and enjoys him almost as much.",1208217600,,243,4.377777777777778
2884376,5,B000SFOY7W,"This DVD is great. Catchy tunes even though that might be a drawback as you hum or sing them in the grocery store. My two year old loves it and SURPRISE!! There is an ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter in the corner if you choose ""Play ASL""! Closed captions are pretty much worthless if you are young and can't read. So I watch with my 2 year old and pick up some ASL. (educational for adults too) I hope this is a sign of the beginning of a trend. (yes, poor pun intended)",1205452800,,479,4.161290322580645
2884377,5,B000SFOY7W,"We didn't jump at this Dvd at first.  The switch between Greg and Sam was a bit strange for our son.  The day it came out, we went to get it, he asked where Greg was.  We put it down, walked away.  I came across it on PPV on day, bought it.  He LOVES it!  It gets him up and moving more then you can say for most children's stuff these days.  Not a Dvd you want to try in the car, but at home where they can run skip and jump along with the Wiggles and their friends! It's a 2 thumbs up.  They also have a second part on learning to read.  Who can complain about that!!! Another Wiggly favorite at our home.",1205193600,,607,3.792
2884378,5,B000SFOY7W,"My son LOVES this DVD! He just saw Sam at the last Wiggles concert and was thrilled to get a DVD with Sam performing as the yellow wiggle, not Dr. Sing-A-Lotta-Songa or one of the wiggly dancers!  I highly recommend this DVD, not only because of Sam but also because of the healthy messages it sends to our kids.",1202083200,,312,4.288135593220339
2884379,5,B000SFOY7W,"After the release of this album, we bought the CD version, but my son loved it so much that we later bought the DVD (in the meantime, we have to go to library to borrow the DVD version first). Watches it every day since, my son and my wife all like it.",1200268800,,252,3.8653846153846154
2884380,5,B000SFOY7W,My nephew absolutely loves it.  He's three years old and watches it over and over.  He's happy to see Sam in this video.,1199664000,,120,4.173913043478261
2884381,5,B000SFOY7W,"My grandson loves the Wiggles, this is the first video featuring Sam, my grandson loved video just as much as the others.  GO WIGGLES!",1199664000,,134,4.583333333333333
2884382,4,B000SFOY7W,"We were very excited to get this new Wiggles.  The best way to describe is...different.  It definitely has a more educational feel to it. I can't believe I watched Murray and Jeff fold origami!
 Sam is wonderful. My 2 1/2 year old really seems to enjoy this movie, even if it is much slower paced than previous movies.  He is watching it for the first time as I type and I can hear him answering the questions the Wiggles ask.  I think he loves them so much, it doesn't matter what they do.
If you are expecting this to have the same feel as every other movie/tv show you've seen, you may be disappointed.  I know I can't sit through this one more than once or twice.  Though, I have watched the tv shows and other movies dozens of times each!  I also expected a movie called ""Getting Strong"" to have more upbeat songs to dance to, but that isn't the case.  I can't believe I miss ""Choo,Choo Chugga Chugga Big Red Car"".
Overall, the Wiggles can do no wrong in this house, but be prepared to watch a ""different kind of Wiggles"".  I hope they go back to the old format for future videos.",1199318400,,1085,4.248780487804878
2884383,5,B000SFOY7W,My son dances and sings to this video all the time...you just can't go wrong with The Wiggles.,1198540800,,94,4.277777777777778
2884384,5,B000SFOY7W,"This is a very good video and a great debut for Sam, who replaced Greg.  We first saw it on cable (On-Demand) and my 3 yr-old daughter immediately wanted a DVD copy so that she can watch it over and over.  My 6 yr-old liked it as well, especially the antics of Capt. Feathersword and Anthony. The song ""Hello, We're the Wiggles"" was not only a good new intro song, but also introduced Sam very well to kids.  My children liked him which is a good indication of how well Sam filled the role.

The only thing that could be better is the use of digital backgrounds.  Either use real backgrounds/locations or improve it.  It also remains to be seen whether the new songs will be hits in the level of ""Fruit Salad"" but all the songs are pretty good.  This DVD is highly recommended.",1197936000,,777,4.317241379310345
2884385,5,B000SFOY7W,My Great-Grandson love this vidio. They watch it and do all the exercises and moves with the group.  They really have fun with it as well as getting exercise when they can't get outside to run an play. I highly recommend it to any parent.,1196467200,,238,4.288888888888889
2884386,5,B000SFOY7W,"This is the latest and most recently distributed The Wiggles dvd and I know. I have all the Wiggles dvds, including this one. It's brilliant therapy with song, dance, and tons of action just perfect for our very curious and active toddlers and gives us parents a ""time out"" as well as a chance to interact with our kiddos. It has inspired my daughter to keep positive during her (too many) hospital visits and I highly recommending this or any Wiggle movie for your child. Caution: tunes are catchy and you will find yourself singing them out in public and look utterly silly doing it. If you are not afraid of being silly, then get The Wiggles.",1194912000,2,645,4.521367521367521
2884387,5,B000SFOY7W,"I was so sad that Greg wasn't going to be part of the Wiggles I wasn't even sure I wanted to buy the new DVD.  Our granddaughter who is 26 months old has been watching the WIGGLES with us since she was six months old, so we were concerned this would bother her.  She seemed to accept SAM and there was new and old music in the DVD.  The best part is that it was much more educational combining phonetics with the usual songs and skits.  Really I don't understand most of the cricism of the silliness, etc.  This is meant for preschoolers,it is meant to be basic, simple and understandable for children with limited vocabulary and motor skills not for their parents.  I love the reinforcement of manners and nutrition and cultural diversity of songs and dances.  YEAH WIGGLES!!!",1194566400,5,777,4.507142857142857
2884388,5,B000SFOY7W,"My kids and I do miss Greg, but Sam's debut was greatly received by our family.

This is an awesome DVD.  My 3 year old daughter keeps showing her muscles and telling me she is getting strong and my 19 month old loves the music.

I miss Greg's voice but Sam has his own unique sound as well.  The songs are catchy and sweet and the fact that this is more of an educational DVD makes this mommy very happy. :-)",1194480000,2,409,4.012345679012346
2884389,3,B000SFOY7W,"Comparing their previous work with Getting Strong, I'd take Getting Strong over the now stale show tune format.  We finally see the fruits of their labor as child educators.  It's true that my 14mo daughter is not as mesmerized with this one, but the older ones help us out while she's doing physical therapy. This is perfect for my 3yo.  I applaud the new format because there's so much worthless entertainment on the tv these days which doesn't promote healthy living or school readiness for young children.  I can't wait for the next installment:  while I'm waiting, I can still hum those old, annoyingly addictive songs in my head while the family plays ""Blow Me Down.""",1193875200,2,673,4.767241379310345
2884390,1,B000SFOY7W,"I was sorely disappointed with this dvd. While I thought Sam Moran did an excellent job replacing Greg Page, the new songs and skits on this dvd are really bad. The songs are not catchy. It was almost as if they made them up on the fly. The backgrounds are really tacky looking throughout the movie. While I'm glad they didn't get lazy on this one by doing rehashes or by including a lot of Spanish Wiggles tunes, the new songs just did not entertain my child at all. I hope they go back to the old formula next time, or that'll probably be it for us with the Wiggles.",1193702400,4,568,4.172727272727273
2884391,2,B000SFOY7W,"The Wiggles new format (whether intended for TV or DVD)lacks the wonderful songs, dances, energy, and sweet goofiness that so endear them to children and adults alike. The ""learning"" skits are weak and repetitive, almost condescending even for an audience of two-year-olds. And Anthony, increasingly hyperactive, fairly leaps off the screen.

Wiggles--please, go back to what you do best! The two stars are for Sam Moran, who has a beautiful voice and charming manner and is a worthy successor to Greg Page.",1193270400,,507,5.182926829268292
2884392,5,B000SFOY7W,"Greg Page was always going to be hard to replace -- his voice is remarkably pleasant and he had a winning way about him -- but Sam Moran surprises in his first video outing.  His voice is different from Greg's, but very fine -- in some ways, more polished.  He also has an amiable manner, and immediately won over my two-year-old daughter.  Judging by her chatter, Sam rivals Murray for the title of her favorite Wiggle character.  I agree with the comment that the digital backgrounds are a drawback, but as the digital work goes in these kinds of videos, what we see here isn't bad.",1193011200,6,584,4.481132075471698
2884393,5,B000SFOY7W,"Sure,this video is more educational then all the past ones. But what none of these reviewers realise is,this video is actually 2 episodes of the Wiggles new television series, Wiggle and Learn,to be airing next year. The highlight of this, for me, was getting to know Sam a little better. His voice is just beautiful (he is clasically trained,after all)and his personality is sweet and goofy. The songs are catchy and fun,and there's plenty of humor too. I agree,it's more for the preschool set and up,not so much for babies. My children,ages 4 and 8 enjoy it,and so do I. Well done Wiggles!",1193011200,6,591,4.747572815533981
