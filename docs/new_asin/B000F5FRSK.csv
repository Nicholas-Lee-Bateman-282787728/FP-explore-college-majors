8162121,5,B000F5FRSK,"Bonnie Consolo was my aunt.  I have fond memories of her that extend beyond the unique ability she had with the use of her feet.  Her philosopy of life was just as unique.  She said ""God blessed me and gave me a talent that seems to inspire others.  I am always aware of this.""  I remember being a passenger in her car while she drove.  I remember coming into my house seeing her as she was playing a song on the piano.  I remember her at the dinner table plucking a fly with her toes.  Yes, Bonnie was a blessing to all of us.  vmc",1315008000,5,532,3.9904761904761905

8162123,5,B000F5FRSK,While this video is old ( probably made in the 70's or 80's) I use it in my classroom (middle school.)  Bonnie is a real hero and a shares a wonderful story of overcoming severe physical handicaps.  She was born with no arms and because she refused to give into the handicap she leads a very normal and happy life.  The film is shot like a documentary and simply shows her daily life and how she keeps house and raises her children with the skills she has developed to overcome her lack of arms.  She is inspiring and happy and amazing.  Everytime I show the film both the students and I are left with such admiration for Bonnie. Bonnie's story helps us realize that determination and grit can go a long way.,1275782400,,708,4.333333333333333
8162124,5,B000F5FRSK,"I saw this movie once or twice in Health class in grade school.  It's a documentary about a woman who was born with no arms, and she does everything, EVERYTHING, with her feet, as if they were hands!  It's an amazing story and I'm now going to buy it for my sister and I to share at home.  I think of Bonnie Consolo on a regular basis --whenever I'm picking out produce at the grocery store or writing a check, not only grateful that I have the use of my arms and hands, but continually amazed by Bonnie's talents.  If kids today are not still watching this in Health class, their parents should pick this up to watch at home.  And I'll bet there are thousands of kids, now adults, like me who have remembered amd been touched by Bonnie Consolo their whole lives.",1200182400,7,763,4.270833333333333
8162125,5,B000F5FRSK,"I was captured by this video 20 years ago.  This woman is a marvel and is to be highly respected for her contribution to: ""Never letting anything hold you back.""  A film that should by viewed by everyone who thinks they have everything or does not have enough.",1146960000,,260,4.395833333333333
