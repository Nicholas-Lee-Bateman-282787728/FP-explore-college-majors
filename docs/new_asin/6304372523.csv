7868757,5,6304372523,"An all Jules White offering of Shemp shorts.

Heavenly Daze - In my Top 10 of Shemp episodes. Shemp gives a great performance as the spirit who comes back to earth to haunt the mischievous Moe and Larry. And special attention must be payed to one-time supporting player Sam McDaniel, who nearly steals the short playing a frightened butler. I really don't know why he wasn't brought back for more shorts, that guy was hilarious. 5 stars

The Ghost Talks - A mixed bag. The plot is thin, but the stooges and especially Shemp give it some sparkle with terrific one-liners and some nice sight gags. Love when that frog goes down Shemp's shirt. 3 stars

Hokus Pokus - One of the more underrated episodes. Shemp's shadowboxing routine versus Vernon Dent may be his funniest yet (You looking for trouble, knock this off my shoulder). I also enjoyed the entire apartment scene, waking up, getting shaved and dressed, and preparing Mary's breakfast. Funny stuff all around. 5 stars

The middle short is a bit average, but overall I rate this a 5 star tape. A worthy addition to any Stooge collection.",1354752000,,1092,4.701570680628272
7868758,4,6304372523,"There is actually some vague notion of thematic unit to the trio of shorts the Three Stooges did for Columbia that are included on this video as Moe, Larry and Shemp deal with various aspects of the supernatural:
""Heavenly Daze"" is a 1948 short where we begin with Moe as Mortimer, the keeper of the Pearly Gates, who has to deny Shemp entrance into the Heaven.  Shemp is given a choice between getting an asbestos suit or returning to earth to reform Moe and Larry, and returns to earth to haunt his cousins.  This proves to be rather difficult and the short ends up with a lot of whipped cream pies being thrown.  This short is the best one of the bunch on this particular video.
""The Ghost Talks"" is a 1949 effort where the Stooges are movers from the A to Z Express Company who are supposed to be moving things out of a castle.  However, the ghost of Peeing Tom (the guy who checked out Lady Godiva during her infamous ride) causes all sorts of mischief because he does not want to move.  This sounds like an idea that might go someplace, but it really does not.
""Hokus Pocus,"" another 1949 short, begins with the Stooges attending poor Mary, a blonde in a wheelchair who is trying to scam an insurance company for big bucks (the boys do not know this).  The next thing we now the Stooges are dealing with the great hypnotist Svengarlic, who sends them out of a flagpole.  Of course, something happens to Svengarlic so the boys come out of their trance, thereby setting up the final collision of the two plot lines.  This has several decent bits by the boys and the best ending of the three episodes.",1072742400,,1604,4.4135593220338984
7868759,5,6304372523,"HEAVENLY DAZE (1948) - An instant Shemp classic! This one is in my top five favorite Shemp shorts. HEAVENLY DAZE was made when Shemp rejoined the stooges (his debut short being FRIGHT NIGHT).
THE GHOST TALKS (1949) - A very funny short! The stooges, as movers, come face to face with poltergeists when they're hired to clear out a haunted castle.
HOKUS POKUS (1949) - A hilarious stooge short! The scene where Shemp is trying to set up the table is very funny! The flagpole scene is the highlight.
HEAVENLY DAZE, THE GHOSTS TALKS, and HOKUS POKUS: 3 well-done and very funny stooge shorts. A must-own for every stooge fan (especially Shemp fans!).",1014422400,3,647,4.734513274336283
7868760,3,6304372523,"HEAVENLY DAZE (1948) - A creative short. Shemp has died, but cannot get into heaven until he reforms Moe and Larry for their bad deeds, and he must stop them from selling a phony fountain pen that writes under whipped cream to a rich couple (Vic Travers and Symona Boniface). The whole short is pretty good, and Shemp gets a lot of attention, although in several parts, he plays in a more straight role which is interesting to see.
THE GHOST TALKS (1949) - One of my least favorite Shemp films. The Stooges go to an old castle to move some antiques, but one of the antiques, a suit of armor, happens to be taken over by a dead spirit. I thought this was very weak. The plot was pretty lame as well as most of the gags, and this didn't have many funny gags to back it up. The actress who played ""Lady Godiva"" has to be one of the worst performers in a Stooge short, even if it was only for a few seconds. She couldn't look any more bored, and her acting was awful.  Not even any effort was put in the title.
HOKUS POKUS (1949) - An okay short. The Stooges are helping out Mary, their neighbor who they think is confined to a wheelchair. What they don't know is that Mary's faking it so she can get some money from the Insurance company. Later in the short, the Stooges meet a hypnotist (Jimmy Lloyd) who they try to get to hypnotize Mary to make her walk, but he hypnotizes them to walk on a flagpole from a very high distance. An okay short.  The flagpole scenes are the highlight.
Decent collection.",994550400,,1500,4.241258741258742
7868761,5,6304372523,"HEAVENLY DAZE is my favorite Stooge short with Shemp. Shemp is so underrated as a comedian/Stooge because everybody loves Curly (hey, I love Curly, too!). But Shemp was a wonderful comedian with great timing, funny mug shots and terrific one-liners. It ain't fair comparing him to Curly, 'cause there is no comparison...each is great in his own way. Shemp never tried to BE Curly, just fill the missing void. And he does masterfully in this outstanding Stooges video. It's one of the best and HEAVENLY DAZE is definitely the film to make you a Shemp admirer! Begin with this one and then check out the other Stooges videos with Shemp. He was a funny, funny man!",978739200,,661,4.706896551724138
7868762,5,6304372523,I LOVE this tape. All the episodes are GREAT! Especially Heavenly Daze. I can't stop watching it. I would love to be in Shemp's place! I recomend this one.,945302400,4,155,4.379310344827586
