8714389,5,6301694155,"This documentary is a classic look at Israel just before the beginning of the first intifada.  It gives a clear-eyed examination of the struggles faced by the Israeli peace activists in the course of the controversial war in Lebanon, of the controversy then over service in the occupied territories, and of the growing influence of Meir Kahane as a force for racism within Israel.  The film is built on a combination of archival footage and contemporary interviews--masterfully blended.  I only wish it was available in DVD.",1428796800,,524,5.069767441860465
8714390,4,6301694155,"This film does not fit into a neat category of good guys vs bad guys. You are given the opportunity to meet several people who live in Israel and deplore the current Nationalist fervor and Intolerance manifest by a small number of Israeli politicals as well as a minority of terrorists from abroad. The film is a plea for dealing with mercy and kindness, rather than setting up an Israeli police state. I believe it gives a fair and open hand at the materials presented. It is not the Israel of nostalgia and Children's color books, but rather a vision gone astray.",1013558400,5,565,4.549019607843137
8714391,1,6301694155,"This video is a tour de force of liberal, left-wing propaganda.  It selects the ""facts"" to paint an extremely biased and inaccurate picture of the Israeli right.  The self-hatred evident among a few Israelis of the left ""lunatic fringe"" is reminiscent of the anti-American sentiment in our own country during the Vietnam war.  If Arafat was really smart - he would tap into his Swiss bank accounts and a buy a copy for every American and European.  For one seeking the ""big picture"" - this was very disappointing.",1009670400,5,513,4.795454545454546
