I always enjoyed Richard Dix but what made want to get the dvd was the presence of Boris Karloff in a role that he seemed to be having fun with...and just a few months he wound up being cast as Frankenstein's Monster. Here is no menace, but one of a trio setting out to right wrong perpetrated by those who are among the elite. In this case, the father of the girl that hero Dix falls in love with.

There is a kind of pulp-magazine feeling about the film. Dix is a charter member, you might say, of that club of seemingly indolent ultra-rich society types who secretly is a man of action, aided by Karloff's ""Professor"" and Paul Burke's second story man, 'Doc'. You kind of wish that Dix would don some kind of Shadow-like outfit as he he lives up to his assumed name 'The reckoner'.

I didn't give it a full five, even though I enjoyed it, because of the production itself, dealing with the coming of sound that caused definite limitations in production values. But for those who want sit back and have some fun, and enjoy Karloff in a good guy role, it's one to enjoy.",1421366400,2,1131,4.305164319248826
