2410875,4,B000BBOUUE,"I try to see every controversial film about sex, drugs and badd as* kids. Anne H. and Bijou who is mmy fave in all controversial films. But she didn't show her bad a** style as usual she was a follower anne was the leader. It suprised me how they wanted to be something they could never be. They were all just scared kids with boring lives tryig to find something real to corrupt their minds. Suprising ending it made me upset that the ending did not have more depth see it for yourself if you like kids, bullly, tart, new best friend then this will be put on your shelf.",1133654400,2,571,4.2

This is a very strong film about 2 girls who try to be ganster wannabes(we all know these people in our lives) and get involed in the real gang world. The stuff that happens to them is sad at times, but it very true. It's a powerful film.",1133568000,4,301,4.298245614035087
2410877,2,B000BBOUUE,"Im not sure what the point of the unrated version was, there is a difference of 8 minutes between the R and the unrated version, if i cut 8 minutes (including in particular one scene not involving hathaway) out of the unrated version, I could wind up with a PG-13 film...Ive seen much worse in R rated films.

all the alleged anne hathaway nude scenes (which to be completely frank was my motivation for buying this movie) with the exception of 2 breast shots less than 30 seconds long were apparently cut before released on dvd. and just an ""ok"" movie at best otherwise. if you are motivated for the same reasons, I wouldnt necessarily recommend it.",1133395200,,650,4.555555555555555
2410878,5,B000BBOUUE,"I saw the film at Munich Film Festival. This is a movie that is intense, it really goes under your skin and that is the hell of a movie experience. Rock 'n Roll film making at its best. Havoc is tens times better then the movie ""Traffic"" I don't care how many Oscars it won. Get the Un-Rated version so you can see the explicited moments. I love the 2 gang bangers members drive by the teens and you hear one gun shot.",1133395200,4,418,4.048192771084337
2410879,5,B000BBOUUE,"Unfortunately, Havoc will probably only be considered ""the movie Anne Hathaway is topless in"". It should be considered the movie that ruined a promising career. Hathaway could've made a lot of money just churning out ""kid friendly"" movies like The Princess Bride movies and Ella Enchanted. In what was a stupid move by either Hathaway or her agent, she decided to make a ""dark"" film and to do nudity. Disney never forgets, Anne.

This movie was laughable at best. The acting was pure trash. It was a bit racist painting the picture of the latin community being full of drug dealers and would-be rapists.

Even Hathaway trying to emulate a ""bad girl"" image was terrible: Her talking ""street"" and using drugs was ridiculous and forced. Her street slang reminded me of the ridiculous moment Christina Aguilera was trying to sound hip and street at one time. The movie isn't even all that ""dark"". There were moments that the movie could've taken a dark turn, but it would suddenly lose momentum. Since when does a friend committing suicide become a comedy element out of nowhere in such a ""serious"" film?

Hathaway might be in luck that this horrible film went straight-to-video rather than being released in theaters, somewhat salvaging her career. I wouldn't even recommend this movie to the perverts that rent this just to see Hathaway nude.",1133395200,5,1340,4.894273127753304
2410880,2,B000BBOUUE,"The studios plan was to release this movie earlier this year, but plans got scraped.  The movie had a great premise of rich teenagers wanting to be someone else.  Anne Hathaway's character, Allison, is a latch-key girl who has parents in a rocky marriage, and she justs wants to get out of her boredom.  But her journey into East LA is the cause of her boyfriend looking for drugs.  These teenagers suffer from low self esteem and hide it through drugs, sex, and acting like hiphop stars.  The movie set up the characters, but unfortunately ironically loses itself once the girls return to East LA.  The plot becomes simplified as the girls try to join the gang and end up with more than they want.

Anne Hathaway does show depth in her character who is pretending to be something she's not.  Everybody is also talking about her nude scenes, but I'm sorry, but the scenes do become hard to watch and you see these girls fall.

The studios wanted something more with this movie and so did I.  The disc does come with a supposed trailer makes the movie a cross between Traffic and KIDS, but fails.",1133308800,6,1095,4.5126903553299496
2410881,4,B000BBOUUE,"Anne Hathaway naked, right?  OK-I'll admit it.  I have never watched the whole DVD all the way through.  I just fast-forwarded to Anne Hathaway's nude scenes and indeed she is topless in the film thrice.  But all the other, more revealing nudity that was supposed to be in this unrated version according to internet postings from folks who saw the whole film, has been cut out. Why?

So get it it you want to see her topless and you won't be disappointed.  But don't expect much else.",1133136000,14,484,4.505747126436781

2410884,3,B000BBOUUE,"A group of bored rich white kids play at being gangstas only to land over their heads.

It's a pretty simple plot, but redeemed by some great performances especially by Anne Hathaway as she plays a bright California high school student playing at a gangster lifestyle.  When she tries to make her fantasy real, things go very wrong as she and a friend end up being sexually assaulted in a hotel room.

The movie then just sort of sputters out.  The two girls split over the incident with one girl going to the police while Hathaway's character tries to tell them it was their fault.  It's an interesting bit of sexual politics that never gets resolved.  Meanwhile her poser friends go off to take revenge on the gangsters.  The film then just sort of ends offering no resolution to the viewer.

There are some very good scenes in Havoc, like Hathaway talking down her suicidal friend through sarcasm, or putting on a show of identities for her friend's amateur documentary.  It was entertaining but nothing special.",1500422400,,1015,4.721590909090909

2410891,4,B000BBOUUE,Interesting look at what happens when people posing and pretending to be a certain type of person come up against someone who really are the thing they're only pretending to be.  Essentially it's a movie about the most extreme type of culture shock possible- the violent kind.  This is easy to miss if you get too caught up in the pretenders ridiculous (on purpose) clothing and dialogue.  It also says something about rich against poor in what on the surface seems at first to be a forgettable popcorn movie- but it's worth watching twice with the second time keeping in mind the culture shock idea of people making amazingly stupid and even hilarious (speech and clothing) choices all in an effort to pretend to be something they're not- and who won't stop even when their decisions get them in more and more trouble.  And yes as noted on the dvd cover it has Anne Hathaway in it.,1479254400,2,882,4.598726114649682

2410912,5,B000BBOUUE,"This is one of my favorite films from a subgenre I like to call the Youth & Chaos genre. These films are dramas that consist of suburban teens getting involved in some sort of chaotic situation like drugs, gangs, crime etc.

The story is about a group of teenage friends lead by Anne Hathaway, who are more than a little rich, heavily influenced by street culture and as Hathaway's character says in the film ""are just f*cking bored!"" This boredem leads them to venture into gang territory to score drugs, and after a tussle that leaves Hathaway's boyfriend (Mike Vogel) with a bruised ego, she, along with her other female friends become intrigued by a dark, edgy side of life, continuing to venture into what they call on the streets ""Eastlos."" The more they venture into ""Eastlos"" the more they become intrigued by the male gangbangers, particularly their leader played by Freddy Rodriguez.

The film is not perfect with a bit of choppy editing here and there, and a few plot points that don't make a whole lot of sense, but the acting is pretty good, writing not bad but could've been better, decent direction and probably the best thing about the production the musical score which is by Cliff Martinez and is haunting yet you almost want to ""bob"" your head to it at the same time, which, now, has become his signature. It also is one of those films you can look back and see so many big stars, Hathaway, included, before they were very well-known like a BALD Channing Tatum, who has all of four lines, and an almost unrecognizable Joseph Gordon-Levitt. If you're into the Youth & Chaos subgenre definitely check this one out!",1440633600,,1631,4.659722222222222

2410948,4,B000BBOUUE,"This film is good, but not great. In the beginning it gives an almost comedic look at a bunch of rich white kids trying to be Gangsta and prove how tough they are. It is set as a documentary that one of the nerdy kids from the high school is making about the group. Reality hits them in the face when they encounter real gang members in East LA.

While much is made about the fact that Anne Hathaway was topless often in this movie, I think what you can take away from this is that she did have acting talent. No the movie itself is not great, but she transitioned from the fake gangsta, to the normal teenage girl who was much smarter than she let on, to being dangerously drawn to a world she really knew nothing about. And you could buy those transitions and believe that she could be all of those things. There were certainly some cliches in the film, and there is nothing in it that has not been done before, but I do think it worked for what it was.

While her performance stood out, I think the other one was actually by the kid who was making the documentary. I think he was a little too mature for a high school kid, but he did play the detached observer well. And his line to Hathaway's character after she basically threw herself at him that she was the loneliest person he has ever met worked well. I don't buy that any high school kid in that position would have turned her down though.

It is a B movie, and while it will never be thought of as an academy award nominee, for the price it is worth the hour and a half.",1365292800,2,1531,4.130872483221476

2410967,3,B000BBOUUE,"Oscar winning documentarian Barbara Kopple takes a crack at scripted drama with this straight-to-DVD release.  This unrated version adds 8 minutes to the original 85, but we can only guess what's been added.  My guess is that we get to see more naughty parts.  Anne Hathaway leaves her princess image behind as a spoiled rich girl from Pacific Palisades, California who becomes easily bored fellating her boyfriend (Mike Vogel) and seeks out a wilder scene in east L. A.

With Toby (Vogel), her best friend Emily (Bijou Phillips) and her wacked out boyfriend Sam (Joseph Gorden-Levitt) they decide to go downtown to score some pot.  While cruising the neighborhood they come across some Latino gang-bangers headed by Hector (Freddy Rodriguez).  Toby, in his white-boy version of Lil' Wayne, decides to confront Hector because he thought his score was a bit light.  That doesn't go well for Toby and his tough guy cred is threatened.

Allison (Hathaway) saves her boyfriend's ass by begging Hector not to shoot him.  At the same time she's exhilarating by the experience and perhaps by Hector.  She returns to the scene a couple more times with just her girlfriends.  The final time it is just her and Emily.  They crash the crew's crib which is in a seedy motel and after a little booze and reefer insist on joining Hector's gang.  The price of admission is having sex with as many of the gang as the roll of a die determines.  Allison rolls an ace and goes for Hector.  Emily rolls a three, but decides she can handle it.  She can't.

Allison manages to leave with Emily but days later Emily decides to file rape charges.  This doesn't sit well with Allison.  Essentially they got what they asked for.  The film flits back and forth between the streets of east L. A. and the upper crust life of the white teens.  The distinctions are sharp but perhaps not as much as it could have been.  The Latinos have families, children and tradition and in daytime scenes seem perfectly happy.  Allison's family includes a mother just out of rehab and a workaholic father who is never home.

The heart of the story itself is hard to buy, and maybe it happens.  But I don't know many people who would cruise east L. A. at night flaunting their classic Chevy convertible sporting their bejeweled whiteness.  I mean really.  That being said, Hathaway and Phillips are pretty damn good in their roles and give the audience an early look at their ta-tas.  The film doesn't have a tidy ending which may upset some.  Not a bad film and an early look at Hathaway's transition as an actress.",1333843200,5,2571,4.676339285714286

2410970,2,B000BBOUUE,"I just watched this movie last night and I cannot recall the last time my mouth was gaped for such a long period of time.  My jaw being ajar wasn't due to the fact that I was so taken by the story.  I was in disarray due to how unintentionally hilarious the film was. I will say that the soundtrack is good for the film.  In addition, the score was done by the amazing Cliff Martinez.

I will keep plot description to a minimum; Anne Hathaway plays Allison a spoiled, stuck up, privileged and ""wannabe thug"".  She runs the streets with all her poser white ""gangsta- thug friends"".  All of her friends and her (sort of) boyfriend are as cheesy and fake as she is.  The interesting and funny part is that Allison (Anne Hathaway) and her friends are high school students that are anything but thugs.  They are living in posh homes, driving very expensive cars and wearing top designer clothing, they definitely are not ""roughing it"".

A scene early on in the film pretty much sets the ground work for the rest of the motion picture.  There is a character; I don't even know what his name was, who is making this documentary of Allison's life.  Why he is making it is never truly revealed, interest in culture or film making and/or he is just smitten with Allison, a loose end that is never addressed.  Digressing, he is shooting footage of Allison at a party, who is dancing with her (sort of) boyfriend and she says (the quote I used as the title of this review) that she and all of her posse are bored...out of their minds.  This boredom really leads this group of adolescents astray.  From the bad parts of downtown Los Angeles, to running with real gang members, fights, the police, drug/alcohol use, grapples with parents and not being able to identify with oneself.

It sounds like the framework for a gripping and candid look of a particular demographic in southern California, well yes and no.  I will give praise to some of the story and even the acting.  I give Hathaway credit for choosing a role, at that moment in her career, was totally different from anything else she had done.  Hathaway had a potty mouth, had an edge, went topless a couple of times and even did a scene where her character masturbated.  Nevertheless, I still felt dubious and indifferent about her character.  Perhaps that was the point, but it is difficult for me to care about a movie when I have no investment in any characters, especially the (supposed) protagonist.

I use to work with teenage boys and girls in a substance abuse/mental health program and some of the behavior in this film was dead on with the population I was working with.  In contrast, some of the performances were so bad that I thought I was watching a satire.  I just kept waiting for Leslie Nelson to walk on for a cameo. I also was very surprise that Allison hadn't met more problems given her behavior, especially involving Freddy Rodriguez's character.

At the end of the day I found this film to be rather pointless, with unlikeable characters and too many loose ends.  I realize the film was trying to mimic life, but in this exercise ""try"" is a four letter word.  The film also serves as a wonderful PSA of ""how to not raise your children"" (Michael Biehn plays Allison's father). If you want to laugh at an unintentional comedy, this might be your movie. I don't totally view Anne Hathaway as one trick pony any more, despite the fact that her performance wasn't amazing and watching her speak in ""gangsta tongue"" was a bit hysterical.  For those people out there who are just itching to see Hathaway topless, well she has three scenes in this movie, knock yourself out.  I would strongly suggest renting before buying.",1312848000,2,3686,4.569254185692542

It was just laughably poor to watch the actors have such difficulty mastering the art of being so badly written, but the dice scene just pushed it from hilarious to disgusting. Bijou Phillips character obviously didn't know that once you toss dice to see how many people you HAVE to sleep with to join the gang, this takes away any right you have to decide who gets to enter what orifice and when.  What she assumes is 3 men one at a time (trashy, yes, but she agrees), turns suddenly into a very unwanted very painful gangbang. Anne Hathaway hears her friend screaming and resisting, storms into the room and pulls her out. Later in the film she proceeds to tell Bijou's character that this was NOT rape because she threw the dice, and she should get over it.  So...she does.

Be careful! The minute you agree to ONE situation, that means you automatically agree to anything they want. At least, that's what Havoc would have you believe. In the film's defense, it's a piece of garbage and I've never actually met anyone else who's seen it, so I suppose the message can be tossed into the trash bin as well.",1285891200,6,1188,4.5162790697674415

The problem is they don't realize that the Latin gang plays for keeps and these girls are really nothing more than high school seniors.

The film should cause alarm for parents of young girls as this type of behavior, though overdramtatized for the movie, is not too far from the truth.  Too many young girls think they can handle the situations live presents but then find things area lot more complicated than they are capable of dealing with.

The acting, especially Anne Hathaway, is good.  Freddy Rodriguez is a convincing gangster.  The story moves reasonably well and the plot is plausible.  I think the emotions of the parents were downplayed, but overall this is not a bad movie.  But watch it at your own risk as it is quite graphic.",1258761600,2,1009,4.681818181818182

This movie shows the life of a girl who feels like everything is fake in her life.  Only her friend Emily seems real. Teenagers, especially girls go through so much growing up.  With the demands of our culture's sexual expression, for us to be older than we are.  Anne Hathaway's character needed to feel something real and she had the charisma to stay safe.  Her exploits into the ghetto was in an attempt to feel something more.  This wasn't some prissy the drug dealer falling for the pretty rich girls like crazy beautiful, this movie was more real.  It gave a glimpse to others of what it is like when you idolize something ugly (living in the ghetto) to the point that its beautiful.  THis real experience with the gang was neccessary to teach her.  The life that rappers rap about isn't the kind of life that you want to live, its one you have to survive and possibly overcome to provide your family/children with money.
This movie is more than just anne hathaway naked.  This movie is for girls like anne hathaway's character, girls that are bored, beautiful, intelligent and lonely.  Girls that have found power in their sex but haven't quite found a comfort in who they are.  She feels like she has no power and so the little power she finds, she exploits.  She goes after the gang member because he is different, harder, powerful (at least in her eyes when he was wheeling the gun) and sexy because of that.

2410990,4,B000BBOUUE,"Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips play two friends who are rich, spoiled brats who are bored with having virtually everything.  Their sheltered upbringing leaves them thirsting for some sort of excitement.  This, in-turn, leads the young ladies down a dark road of drugs & violence.  Early on in the story they hang out with a white gang full of people who act like they're black gangstas.  From there, our mis-guided friends believe they're moving up the food chain by hanging out with a Mexican gang in a sordid part of L.A. where even the L.A.P.D. is reluctant to go.

This movie seems to me to be an overt attempt by Hathaway to shed her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-Diaries-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B00006L948/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess Diaries (Full Screen Edition)</a>&nbsp;persona.  If her objective was to keep from being type-cast in the future as only capable of happy-go-lucky roles, then she succeeded!  She is perfect for the present role precisely BECAUSE she doesn't look like a young woman who would be prone to hang out w/gangs;  she would seem far too demure and innocent for that sort of thing.

Even though the movie is unrated, I still was not expecting Anne to shed her clothes.  I will concede that I nearly fell off my couch when she first took her shirt off!  Anne has the capacity to be the Denise Richards of her generation, and quite possibly become a far more accomplished actress than Richards.  In time, she may even approach the calibre of our girl Jennifer Connelly!

The story itself is a dark one.  The characters of Anne & Bijou must learn a basic lesson of growing up the hard way:  when you play with fire long enough, eventually you are going to get burned.  It's all fun & games, after all, until a psychopathic drug dealer is pointing a gun @ your head.  Along the same path, the movie has a serious erotic element to it that quickly takes a left-turn and becomes disturbing.  I'm guessing that's what usually happens when you combine gangs with sex.  I'm guessing that's typically not a prudent nexus?

If you're into gang movies, this film is a must.  If you're not into mob movies but you're very into seeing Anne Hathaway topless, then this DVD is  a must.  The fact that Anne's real-life boyfriend was sent to jail for being a white collar scam-artist may be an interesting footnote to your motivations for picking up this one.",1232755200,8,2443,4.963054187192118

2411016,2,B000BBOUUE,"Havoc (Barbara Kopple, 2005)

Havoc, oddly, finds itself in the unenviable position of being a character-driven movie whose characters are not strong enough to survive without a plot. The end result, as one might expect, is sometimes intriguing, but that's not enough to battle the boredom of the rest of the movie's running time.

There isn't much of a plot, as it's a character-driven movie, but what there is is that a bunch of gangsta wannabes get mixed up with a real East LA drug dealer. This begs the question: if gangsta wannabes are deeply annoying in real life, why would anyone want to watch an hour-and-a-half movie about them? Even the prodigious acting talent of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the toplessness of Anne Hathaway can't save this, perhaps because neither (the only two interesting things about the movie) get nearly enough screen time. Levitt, at least, seems to be having some fun with his character, while all the other white males come off as Eminem wannabes, the Hispanics in the movie are all walking stereotypes, and the women are there to provide supporting material-- even though two of them (Hathaway and Bijou Phillips) are in the lead roles.

I'm not sure why I haven't learned yet; I haven't liked a Stephen Gaghan screenplay since Rules of Engagement seven years ago. Maybe this will finally be enough to convince me he's the screenwriting equivalent of post-1990 Joel Schumacher. *",1189987200,,1416,4.9411764705882355

I think most people are going to see through this and laugh their way into turning this DVD into a Frisbee.  Having lived in the Hispanic ghetto for seven years, I can tell you white girls do not flock to either the Filipino or Hispanic parties.  I think, by process of elimination, you can do the math and figure out which ethnicity I'm talking about.  Hint: It's not the Caucasian gangs, either.  Another hint: It's the ethnicity that 99% of rap and hip hop artists are.  Not that gangs of this ethnicity are any worse, but they are the ones that get this kind of attention.  Clearly this minor (sarcastically rolls eyes) fact was altered to be more politically correct.  Personally, I think the hip hop culture needs a swift kick in the bollocks.  If done accurately, it would have been a bunch of 11 to 16 year old cute suburban white girls smoking pot and being gang raped (statutory or otherwise) by a bunch of...well, you know where I'm going with this.  Before you call me a racist, remember I lived it and you did not, and your emotional response to what I'm saying is the same reason the film makers were compelled to take the ""less offensive"" route and probably change the original script.  Apparently they don't think Mexicans feel offense, I guess.  Furthermore, the idea that any kind of genuine romance actually blossoms out of this rotten scene is clearly more Hollywood marketing fluff, as is the happy ending.  Reality is far more insane and extreme than this film achieves, but you get a taste for the general behavior, at least.  Lastly, I feel sorry for Bijou Phillips constantly being exploited like this.

1. Girls looking for thrills/excitement in East L.A.?  I don't think so.  Go rolling to East L.A. in a convertible Mercedes or SUV?  Can you say car-jack victim?  I can...without any bias whatsoever.

2. The initiation scene is somewhat realistic.  It has been said that in order for girls to join certain male dominated groups (gangs, etc.), that they must submit themselves to the 'group.'  That has been documented in the press...any teenage girls out there?  Well, beware!!

3. As a person who has been to Palisades High School in West Los Angeles (yes, folks, Pacific Palisades High School is real, just minutes from the beach!).  You do indeed see kids immersed in the hip-hop culture.  The difference?  Some of these kids' families are very well-off.  That part of the movie comes through very well.  Families with the kind of money depicted in the film are usually quite busy making money, and not home for their kids...well, you know the rest.

4. Finally, the scene where the Palisades boys go to look for the gang-bangers that ravaged their friend was just unrealistic.  These guys would have been seen a mile-off and would have been dealt with accordingly.  Strangers in a strange land, would be an adequate description.

It wasn't because the movie was great (believe me, it wasn't), not because the acting was inspired (average at best, insipid at times), and certainly not because Anne Hathaway decided to appear topless (whopee-big-deal, another young actress willing to show her lack of common sense). No, I just couldn't figure out what I was missing that made some people rave about this movie. Guess what, I still don't get it. A previous reviewer said it was a ""well-meaning movie."" I guess that's true but unfortunately, it failed it whatever it was trying to mean.

The plot is curiously the opposite of Hathaway's movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-Diaries-Special-Edition/dp/B000209KMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess Diaries (Special Edition)</a>. Here we see a rich & spoiled girl with disinterested parents trying to submerge herself into the Latino gang experience. I guess that must have been the attraction for Hathaway, making a film as far away as her squeaky-clean image as possible. Nothing wrong with that but she might have picked a movie that wouldn't have to have used her toplessness as their main marketing point. In other words, pick a movie that would be worth it.

Not that it didn't have its moments. One of the most interesting characters was the teen (sorry, can't remember his name) who was making a film about all the happenings with the ""cool crowd"". Some of his insights on the character of each person were actually quite good. His comment to Hathaway's character about being one of the loneliest people he knows really brought forth the whole point of the movie. But it was just too little, too late.

Overall, I would say pass on this movie. The plot is anemic, the acting not much better than a high school play, and all the stereotypes it plays off of just makes it all seem too contrived. Thumbs down and Ebert and Roper would say.",1183075200,,2046,5.101492537313433

The spirit of La Bamba permeates this film insofar as we are supposed to understand how Anne Hathaway genuinely ""shares a moment"" for her Ritchie Valens.  I have no idea what the characters' names are in this movie but everyone is familiar.  Laura San Giacomo is in it, Reese from Terminator is in it, boy from Third Rock From the Sun and busty loosey goosey teen is played again by no longer a teen Bijou Phillips. I thank them all for doing this public service announcement about treating thug life as a consumer product.

I feel so sorry for that young looking Hispanic actor who had to play the Ritchie Valens part in this movie complete with the big man walk.  I think he even did that cigarette drag and unplug that shows you are tough.  If the characters had been permitted to have a real romance, we would have been favored with close ups of tears standing in his eyes and the line in his cheek from biting down on his back teeth during moments of romantic misunderstanding.  This movie also has the 40-something year old actor who played the surviving marine in Clear and Present Danger.  Unfortunately, Esai Morales is too busy doing phone card commercials on Spanish television to participate in this amazing film.

Obviously, the Socs from Pacific Palisades can't take on Sabor Latino so I think a sequel/crossover is called for where the Socs bring in the Southies from Good Will Hunting.

p.s. Anne Hathaway raps or sings some gangsta moll song early in the movie.  She does a lot of acting with her eyes in this movie resembling a pretty fit Liza Minnelli and is the main reason that this movie is not terrible.  It's not too heavy or embarassing or violent to be ""important"" and therefore unwatchable.

Despite the good acting of Freddy Rodriguez as Hector, to whom our heroine is romantically attracted, the Latino characters are little better than stereotypes.

In fact the film could have been a great social commentary or a riveting drama with better characters (and the screenplay is written by Stephen Gaghan, ""Syriana""). It is extremely difficult to show a couple of spoiled, affluent teenagers without making us feel ""So why should we care?"" and ""Havoc"" seems to need someone who can fix this problem. It may not be your cup of tea, but ""Thirteen"" did a better job with equally annoying, but more round characters.

What makes ""Havoc"" special is the presence of young stars including Anne Hathaway, Bijou Phillips, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Freddy Rodriguez. It is true that Anne Hathaway disrobes herself, but those """"topless"" scenes are nothing pornographic; however, it is also true that the film could be without them from the beginning. If you want to see Anne Hathaway breaking away from her ""Princess Diary"" image, she would do better in ""Brokeback Mountain.""",1177632000,4,1565,5.015384615384615
2411037,4,B000BBOUUE,"I have a soft spot for films with exposed flaws. In all honesty, this film should only have two stars, but for me it is a guilty pleasure.

Daredevil & Kangeroo Jack are my two favorites.

Havoc enters onto this list because its a film whose style changes with every scene. It's the first non-documentary film from Barbara Kopple and you can tell she's itching to document and not force life to do her bidding. And this ""hands off"" directing leads to things like Anne Hathaway's ""one take only"" acting.

The way that the white kids are portrayed is comical and I believe intentionally so. I know I laughed at them in high school. They look and sound rediculous. Especially Anne Hathaway's ""come hither"" dance in the first party scene where she ""drops the n-bomb."" She's completely incapable of delivering those lines realistically. The party scenes throughout the film run parellels that are intriguing characterwise. Anne Hathaway drops her act and behaves like herself around Hector, while Bijou keeps it up and gets reprimanded.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt once again shows his chops as an acting wonderchild with a fantastically comical performance. He is definately going to be a person to watch in the next ten years.

The film is about facades and stereotypes and how people wear the masks created by others in order to feel true and real. Anne Hathaway's tri-romance between Mike Vogel, Bijou Philips and Freddy Rodriguez each satisfy and aspect of self that she is in crisis over. But none of them are fulfilling because of the walls that are set by those around them. I think it's one of the few films I've ever seen where a main character is forced to juggle three people at once.

The scene where Anne confronts Mike the night after they go downtown was well done and pretty honest. Then the ""girls night"" immediately following is hysterically true as well.

The documentary that Matt O'Leary's character is filming is a nice device and leads to some of the most important scenes in the film. He is the only character that is real and does not ""play the game."" But this may be an endorsement by Kopple that filmmakers are the only truthful people on the planet. My favorite scene is the one between Anne Hathaway and Matt O'Leary where he confronts her and starts to ask her questions she is to afraid to answer, she jumps from one facade to the next and attempts to ""seduce him"" but he wants her not the fake her and denies her ""advances."" It should be the crux of the film, but it falls flat because as an actress Anne Hathaway is incapable of playing all of those people.

But! Its intentions are noble and the parents are brilliant. It's just to bad that they didn't tone it down and play it a lot straighter. It might have been a great film. They were just to busy marketing it to teenagers and not trying (ironically enough) to make it more cinema-veritae. Hopefully Kopple's next fore into fiction will be less plagued by errors.",1173744000,6,2942,4.655105973025048
2411038,3,B000BBOUUE,"This is one of those well-meaning movies made by well-intentioned people trying to comment on important social phenomena that winds up accidentally undercutting everything it wants to say by its flawed execution. The funniest thing about Havoc is that it was made by Barbara Kopple who is well known for making quality documentaries, yet it feels so resoundingly and thoroughly fake throughout (and of course Stephen Gaghan is sort of the current reigning writing champion of real yet simultaneously somehow very fake, which I say as someone who quite liked Syriana).

One really terrible decision (and I don't know whether to blame this on Gaghan or the original story) was to have a student making a movie about his fellow students in the movie. The idea was presumably supposed to be that it would allow for things/facts/themes to be said by the actors straight to the ""documentary"" camera that would have been difficult to establish quickly through dialogue but the result is a disaster where none of the people addressing the ""documentary"" seem to be coming from reality or talking like actual human beings.  The only payoff for this decision is a great scene where Hathaway torments the young male filmmaker by flaunting her sexuality in front of him but on the whole, it was not a good decision to use this device.

As someone has already commented, the teens behaving badly scenes here are like slickly hollywoodized renditions of moments from Larry Clark's indie Kids (and note that Bijou Phillips also already appeared behaving badly in Clark's other kids behaving badly movie Bully); but then perhaps that's just a difference between New York and La La Land and perhaps this movie is a lot more real about L.A. than I know as an east coaster. The key to really enjoying Havoc is not to take it all that seriously and then you can have a very good time with it; try to think of it as an kind of overheated teen delinquency 50s-style melodrama. Hathaway is very pretty and tries hard with this movie; I admire her for taking the part and for gracing us with glimpses of her bared lovely skin. And some individual scenes are in fact pretty compelling or touching on their own, just in a rather exaggerated aftershool-special melodramatic way. So my advice is, don't go into Havoc expecting serious commentary on the state of our youth today and just take what fun it gives you.",1173571200,6,2385,4.798053527980535

2411041,4,B000BBOUUE,"The two main characters aren't realistic and they aren't stereotypes, they're unique works of imagination. I see it as a tragic romance about a couple drawn to each other because of the novelty value they see in each other's socio-economic class, and ultimately pulled apart because of their refusal to see their own class as a novelty. Allison wanted to hang out with Hector but still be treated as an adorable princess. Hector wanted to hang out with Allison but still be treated as an intimidating gangsta. They both compromised a bit, but Hector was already losing respect from his peers for letting her hang out in his neighborhood, and eventually she forced his hand by not taking his gang seriously in front of his peers, and he did what he had to to maintain their respect, treated her the way his culture says he's supposed to treat women.

There was a little bit of empty space in this movie, and extra details that served to detract as often as add, but the juxtaposition and interaction between Allison and Hector shows there's a lot more to them than the gangsta and the poser that most viewers seem to want to reduce them to. I saw both of them as defined by their desire to be more than their culture would allow.

The idea that this movie was trying to document gangsta culture or faux-gangsta culture as though it's a new idea never occured to me because it's so obviously not and nothing in the film hinted at ambitions in that direction. The one original idea in the movie was the way the cross-culture romance developed, so that's what stuck with me.

Whatever this film's shortcomings it's still better than 90% of what else has been released in cinemas in the past year or two.",1171929600,3,1699,4.582236842105263

Yes, they have valid points: these characters are at times unbearable to watch, especially the wanna be Pacific Pallisades rich white kids trying to ""act all dope"" and ""street"".  You really want to see some harm come to them.  The street gang they seek out are just gangbanger thugs.  Welcome to our culture of MTV and rap music.  I've seen small town kids in the Midwest trying to act all ghetto and it's really sad.

But what HAVOC is trying to do is confront the poisonous effects of our unchecked culture on today's youth: there's an ugly reality behind all the posturing, there's a rage and hatred in the music and parties and mystique of the barrio--and our media is selling it as a product.

When I first heard about this movie, its sole selling point was that Anne Hathaway was doing nude scenes.  Okay.  Big news, I guess.

But don't sell this movie short: there's a depth and a realistic worldview and a warning here.

If you can stomach the pornographic and violent lyrics and dialogue that your kids are listening to every day, you might see what this film is really saying.",1169078400,6,1203,4.523148148148148
2411070,1,B000BBOUUE,"This movie probably has an audience, but I found it unbearable.  I'll tell you what it's got to offer without spoiling it for you, but you should know better than to watch this.  I knew better from the first twenty minutes, but I watched the rest anyway.  Maybe that's why I felt the need to write this.  Hoping that writing this review will be cathartic.

So what does Havoc have to offer?  There's a down side to spoil everything resembling a good point.

Anne Hathaway is easy on the eyes.  However, you'll have to look past the silly actions taken by her character - the motivations of these are never reasonably explored.  Are privileged teens from affluent families really this irrational out of boredom?  Steven Soderburg did more to show a realistic portrait of this kind of downward spiral with Erika Christensen's character in Traffic.  So don't look to Havoc for realistic characters.

The Beverly Hills guys are funny with their gangsta act, but their predictability gets tiresome.  They're all pretty much the same character (ie a stereotype of the white teenager trying to act gangsta).  The movie Whiteboyz covers this territory more ably.

Moral panic inspiring scenes where teens engage in risky behavior are peppered throughout the movie.  They just aren't very well done.  These scenes seem to be played more for titillation than for realism or drama.  Gross.  These looked like pastiches of scenes from Larry Clark's 1995 movie Kids.  However, Havoc fails to project the same sickening nihilism that is found in Clark's movie.  And here is the ultimate problem with Havoc.  Like a B horror movie, it's not real enough to be scary.  What's the point then?

The characters aren't interesting or realistically written.  The situations are flimsy contrivances.  Nothing surprising actually happens.  You'll have to watch Havoc yourself to make the call, though.  I watched it all of the way through, and maybe that's why I'm so bitter today.",1168819200,10,1957,4.95679012345679

Freddy Rodriguez (Six Feet Under, Harsh Times) is here as their leader (along with Raymond Cruz, once again cast to type), to whom there is an immediate attraction with Hathaway, but as things develop and turn foul, everyone gets a real lesson in the ""thug life"".  From the minute it starts, Havoc is ripe for the kind of social satire that could be derived from the suburban white kid gangsta wannabe world, but Oscar winners Stephen Gaghan and Barbara Kopple try to make it into a morality tale, and it doesn't work.  Hathaway really shows her stuff (literally) and delivers promising acting chops that really carry the film and save it from the trash heap.

2411074,4,B000BBOUUE,"When watching this movie, I knew there was going to be a need to suspend judgement, belief, etc., to some extent so I went into it with an open mind. What I got back was a pretty good experience. Surely most have seen films which depict such improbable combinations with predictable results. It was thus not necessary to be graphic about the outcome and the ambiguity was more of a selling point than a distraction. Anne Hathaway is an impressive character. Had never seen her before but can see that she is capable of carrying a film. Bijou Phillips I have seen many times watching ""Bully"" and it was interesting to see her in something different though not really all that different. I know she is McKenzie's half-sister and just happened to watch ""American Graffitti"" recently in which the latter was a juvenile and could really see the similarity in expressions maybe three times in this movie. The cinematography was good as well as the music and even the physicality.

2411075,2,B000BBOUUE,"The movie is about a bunch of bored rich kids in L.A. who for some reason have this need to act all tough and trash-talk (they call themselves ""wiggers"" - you can start laughing now).  The movie focuses on Allison (Hathaway) and her friend Emily (Phillips) who take it further than anyone by ""befriending"" a gang in east L.A. Then about 30 minutes into the end they want to join the gang, one of them yells ""rape"" and the white rich boyfriends who also act like wanna-be gangsters show up with guns. And that's about it.

Now the movie really isn't as bad as it sounds in itself.  Sure, the plot is completely unoriginal, but Anne Hathaway carries the movie and makes it bearable, and she's probably the only one that's believable in this movie, and just to see her perform is worth the watch.

But other than that, it's like a serious version of ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" from Jamie Kennedy...and they're as believable as him, which makes the movie lose all sorts of credibility.  It also has a hint of ""Thirteen"" and ""Crazy/Beautiful"" in it, but these 2 movies are in a whole different league than this one.

Other than the fact that it's not very believable (except for Anne Hathaway who is excellent, which has nothing to do with her nude scene, same goes for Bijou Phillips), the problem is that it shies away from the really ugly, harsh reality, especially the end, it's all very sugar-coated and ends way too well for the movie that it's pretending to be.  I also didn't appreciate the ending very much because it makes it seem like the movie was completely pointless. No one really learns anything, and at one point there's a shooting, the screen goes black, and you're never told what happened.

All in all, it's a good showcase of Anne Hathaway's acting chops, but that's about it. I'd say it's worth a rental at best.",1165968000,4,1825,4.559633027522936

Allison and her ""crew"" Emily (Bijou Phillips), Amanda (Shiri Appleby), Sasha (Alexos Dziena) and boyfriend Toby (Mike Vogel) enjoy emulating gang lifestyle, right down to the clothes, music, and fights.  Allison's group is called PTC, and they get into a fight with another crew at the beginning of the film, and Allison is right in the middle, punching and kicking.

After disposing of the rival crew, Allison's crew decides to try to buy some cocaine.  It is here that they run into Hector (Freddy Rodriguez) and his crew.  Toby buys the drugs from Hector, but Toby accuses him of gyping them.  A confrontation occurs between Hector and Toby, and Allison steps in at the last minute to save Toby from being shot.  Afterward, Toby retreats into himself, but Allison becomes intrigued with Hector and the entire gang culture.

Allison and the girls decide to go to a party hosted by Hector, and they are soon drinking and fooling around with Hector and his friends.  Later on, Allison and Emily decide they want to join Hector's crew.  Hector tells them that they must roll dice, and the number that comes up is the number of crew members they must sleep with.  Allison rolls a one, Emily rolls a three.  Allison chooses Hector, and Emily chooses another member of the crew.  They go into a hotel room and begin making out.  After a few minutes, Allison breaks it off with Hector, but Emily keeps going.  Unfortunately for Emily, things get a little rough, and Allison comes in and saves her.

Emily claims she was raped and decides to press charges against Hector and the others.  Arrests are made and Hector is taken into custody.  The other members of Hector's crew decide to go after Allison and Emily.  However, Toby has gotten wind of Hector's crew's plans and heads off to stop them.  Bursting into the hotel room where Hector was staying, instead they find a  terrified young woman and her child.  While driving back, Toby crosses paths with Hector's crew, and as the screen fades out, gunshots are heard.  What will become of Allison and Emily?

Anne Hathaway definitely loses her G-rated innocence from her ""Princess Diaries"" days by appearing nude in this film.  Her swearing and drug use further separate her from her earlier films.

As for the plot, it only kept me mildly interested.  There is constant swearing and nudity throughout the film, so it is definitely not an appropriate movie for younger viewers.  The lack of character development is also disappointing.  Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips do a fairly good job, but the rest of the acting is only average.

Hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as Bijou Phillips and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this drivel.  Hathaway and her friends, the ""PLC"" as they call themselves, are products of upper-class Palisades in California.  Bored with their seemingly bland lives, they adopt the ""gangsta"" mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize.  In truth, they're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable, snot-nosed posers.  We've all encountered this type before.  You see them at the mall wearing the most expensive ""Rocca"" wear and and ""FUBU"" even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing.  They think that they have no identity of their own, so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be.

In this tale, Hathaway's group has a run-in with a Latino gang.  Drawn to these outlaws, Hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an all-night party.  Hathaway then returns with one of her friends (Bijou Phillips), and the two take the downward  spiral into supposed gang life.  In the end, however, something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang.  Their actions cause a number of things to occur.  The results of those actions are status quo for their social status.

Although the film is pulled down by a lot of over-acting (Gordon-Levitt seems to have channeled Jamie Kennedy's ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" character, B-Rad), the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed street-tough Latino gang headed up by Freddy Rodriguez.  First of all, I'd think that a real gang would have taken out the ""PLC"" without flinching.  Secondly, had four ""innocent"" little girls actually made it into the gang's party, I'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance.  Instead, Rodriguez backs off on the posers of the ""PLC"" and seemingly falls for Hathaway's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang.

Full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie, ""Havoc"" is a dud.  Unbelievable, uneventful and definitely a rental.",1162166400,4,2314,4.7808564231738035

Whether or not it is common for wealthy, very attractive girls to head to the other side of the tracks and engage in sex with drug dealers in order to become gang members is unknown to me because I belong to neither group. However implausible it sounds, it does make for an unusual and fairly interesting film. There are some decent moments in this film and tension certainly builds, though a few things kept it from being good. The bored white teens from Pacific Palisades are supposedly from wealthy families, but there isn't much shown to suggest that. Perhaps the film's budget was very limited because the ending is also truncated to a point of being ambiguous. What are the fates of Toby and Emily?

The teenagers have their own gang, if you can call it that, called the PLC, which is basically an excuse for them to get dressed up in Ecko and Enyce, listen to hip hop music, and talk like they're from the ghetto.  Hathaway's character Alison says it best with the statement, ""We're just teenagers and we're bored.""  The gang they get involved with, 16th Street, isn't bored and it's not a game to them; it's a way of life.  It's easy to see why they don't take Alison and her friends seriously.

As mentioned before Anne Hathaway gets naked. Woohoo! But so does Bijou Phillips.  The true hidden gem of this film is the spectacularly bad acting of Phillips as Hathaway's best friend. I mean, this is the same girl who has starred in such splendid films as Bully and Tart. Quite frankly, everything Bijou Phillips is in turns to garbage, and I love her for it.

The movie is suprisingly powerful, if there is one flaw it's the ending is rushed. You get a feeling from Alli's character is more of an oops, I messed up and blames everything she did on being young and stupid. There also seemed to be a subplot with the camera kid, but that was not touched on to much. Other than that I felt the movie was very well done, showing how bad thing can get if you go to far. Sadly this is an often times all to real look at LA teens. This should serve as a message to parents, get active in your kids lives and for god-sake's talk to them and love them.

But so does a much more brilliant film Brokeback Mountain when she is having sex with Jack in the station wagon, asking his ""Am I going too fast?"" This movies plays like a sad violin. The storyline is simple: rich teenagers feel like they are unwanted so they act ""black"" and have sex a lot. Anne Hathaway is such a good actress, portraying Allison, a stressed out teen who wants to be someone else, or in her words she is ""Sick of this phony life."" Bijou Phillips plays Allison's best friend, Emily, who (SPOILER ALERT!!!---gets raped by two Mexican gansters.) The film is a dazzling display of affection for what many people want to do, pretend to be someone else. Allison wants to change her lifestyle, so she gets involved with a Mexican ganster, who deals drugs. Barbara Kopple makes this film a complete aray of brilliance. It is slow at parts, and the ending makes you think of what really happened.

The film progresses and makes a big band at the end---literally. The rest of the cast includes Spy Kid's Matt O'Leary, 10 Things I Hate About YOu's Goseph Gordon-Levitt, and TV's Drake and Josh's Josh Peck. The film was released straight to DVD because the studio did not know how to release it, and for obvious reasons, I agree with them.

The plot line is that a bunch of rich white kids suffer collective brain farts and begin to emulate black (insert any ethnic group) gangs. The rich white kids show that they are only ""legends in their own minds."" Anne, of course, is the chosen one of the bunch that actually shows a bit of intelligence (along with her breasts). She rebels against her own pseudo ""gang-bangers"" and spends time with Latino gang members. Did I mention Anne shows her breasts? Did I mention that Anne gives oral sex? (Not shown, just left to your imagination like in the 60's love scenes where they cut to the beach. Here we see Anne wiggle her feet.)

2411124,1,B000BBOUUE,"First of all, I love Anne Hathaway, and it was very refreshing to see her in another role besides another Walt Disney movie. However, What the hell was she thinking? She needs to go find her agent and fire him immediately because movies like this can be career suicide. On a positive note, I must say it does in fact prove not only does Anne have the acting chops, but she isn't a one dimensional actress. I really don't wanna see her waste her talent by getting sucked into the one genre gene pool, and never being able to breakaway from it. However, this movie was intentionally a mockery of the Hip-Hop culture. Now, this is only my opinion, but being raised in the Hip-Hop community, I thought it was not only insulting, but ridiculous watching a whole bunch of bored, rich, surburban, pathetic, wanna-be black/white kids walking, talking and acting black. Frankly, I thought it was making fun of the whole culture in general. Don't get me wrong, I have a sense of humor, but what started off as funny ended up being a bit stereotypical. Come on, Bijou Philips had the most predictable role of all. First of all, let me just say that contrary to a lot of other reviews, she's not raped by the 2 Latin guys. Correction, she got a train run on her by the 2 Latin guys. There's a big difference between the 2 sexual acts. They didn't hold her down and force her to do it. Frankly, she got caught up in a freaky threesome where she invited both men to sleep with her, and right in the middle of the action she decides that she's had a brain fart, or a momentary lapse in judgement, snaps out of it, and all of a sudden doesn't wanna do it anymore. Then, she starts screaming and crying bloody murder like she's just been taken advantage of....PUHLEEZE! I didn't feel sorry for her one bit. Anybody who saw that scene as more than that should rewind the tape, or start the scene over on the DVD. Come on, let's assume we're all grown here, so there's no need to play games we all know what time it is. My bad, even if you aren't grown, let's just assume we all have common sense for a second. If you invite another man into your bed while you're already having sex with one, you better be sure about what comes next. I mean was anybody really surprised when she accused the Latin guys of rape when she asked for it...I think not. I saw that scenario coming a mile away. On top of that, these kids are so bored that they travel from the suburbs to the slums of East L.A were there are nothing but Hispanics, drugs and gang wars. Then, they become mesmerized by this lifestyle like it's actually a good thing when they are way in over their heads. Anyway, they go down there showing and proving they are ready and willing to do anything to fit in. I'm sorry, but I saw the stereotypes that were running rapid in this movie. I am not a race card throwing person, but I just have to explain the movie for what it was, or at least how I saw it. Maybe, I did miss the point of the film, but this is just my opinion. Really, we've seen this a thousand times. Come on, rich white kids, with too much money and time on their hands, no parental guidance, looking for action, getting tangled up with wrong crowds or minorities, getting into more trouble than they can handle, a white girl accuses somebody of rape (usually a black man) in this case, a Hispanic man, and as a result of the lie people have to die. I've seen (and heard) this story too many times to impressed. I'm sorry, but none of these nationalites were displayed in a positive light. To me, that's not entertainment.

Soon, Hathaway goes back and starts to hang out with his crowd, he brings her girls along with her.

2411149,3,B000BBOUUE,"When I saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" I thought that was the film in which Anne Hathaway made it clear she was not going to be doing any more princess movies for Disney by dong a nude scene.  But then I discovered that after making her second princess movie and then doing vocal work for ""Hoodwinked,"" Hathaway made ""Havoc"" and went from PG to R without a transitional PG-13 movie (okay, unrated in terms of the DVD, but R in the theater).  I heard that Mandy Moore was originally cast as the lead for this film and I have to wonder if she bailed given what the role required or if they changed the script to give it this ""harder"" edge that it has now.  Putting in deleted scenes to justify labeling it as unrated might increase the word of mouth about the film, but it did not improve it in any way that will impress anybody with a more than prurient interest in the festivities.

Hathaway plays Allison Lang, a bored high school student who lives in an affluent part of Los Angeles.  Along with her boy friend, Toby (Mike Vogel), best friend, Emily (Bijou Phillips), and everybody else in her group, Allison talks and dresses like bone fida members of the gangster culture from the music they listen to.  They strike us as being pretty sad and pathetic, a judgment that is amply underscored when Toby tries to score some crack cocaine in East L.A. and is brought all the way down to the ground by Hector (Freddie Rodriguez, who does a much better job of getting beyond his role on ""Six Feet Under"" to impress viewers).  If not for Allison's intervention Toby and everybody else in their car might have ended up dead.  After this encounter Toby retreats into bravado, while Allison, having seen the real thing, responds to the danger.  She drags Em along for the fun, and keeps pushing things with Hector and his gang until they come to a head.

The story here can be traced back to a spec script called ""Powers That Be"" that Jessica Kaplan sold in 1995 when she was still a teenager.  Kaplan, who based the screenplay on her experiences in high school were her white friends were caught up in imitating gangster culture, died in the crash of a small plane in Los Angeles in 2003 (the film is dedicated to her).  Stephen Gaghan revised the story and finished the screenplay, so he ends up being responsible for what we have seen.  The idea of telling a story about these characters is certainly worth pursuing.  I can remember chaperoning a prom and watching a bunch of white girls standing together on the dance floor singing along to rap songs and thinking that it would be hard for them to be removed much farther from the culture they were imitating.

The flaw with ""Havoc"" is rather interesting.  It constructs a situation so that when Allison and Em agree to be initiated into Hector's gang that you know this is going to get bad.  What follows makes it clear things are going to go so far beyond bad that you have to face down an impulse to stop the movie before you get to the really bad part.  But then ""Havoc"" backs off and after an initial sense of relief you realize this is a movie that was made with the safety on, which puts us in the ""no guts, no glory"" territory.  Ironically, what derails the movie is a scene that shows the best part of what is going on is the relationship between Allison and Em, even though it does not always seem like this is a good thing.  Ultimately the only sympathetic character is Eric (Matt O'Leary), whose omnipresent camcorder distances him from the rest of the group, but who is able to make a pointed remark that surprisingly hits home for Allison.

Those who check out this film because of Hathaway's nude scenes will find something similar in the scene where she is being filmed by Eric where things get rather interesting and then the off switch is hit.  Basically, that is what this movie does.  It plays a game of chicken with cold harsh reality and then it yanks the wheel hard and quick so it can paste together a ""happy"" ending before the credits role.  I can appreciate Hathaway's reasons for taking this job, but her character of Allison ends up proves to be guilty of slumming, and not even first-rate slumming at that.  That makes the nudity and profanity somewhat gratuitous, all things considered.",1138320000,99,4256,4.5032509752925876

The story has been told before.. I grant you that, but still the acting and the emotions are believable. Rich kids looking for a ""real"" experience so they get hooked up with gangsters and their troubles.

Anne Hathaway gives a good performance as a smart ass kid who wants to get away from her boring life into the unknowns of downtown LA. She kooks up  with a group of gangsters known as the 16th street gang. He interactions gives her more of a learning experience than she wanted. Throughout the process she is somewhat composed, but still frazzle when things go wrong.

At the end things go horribly wrong and hard lessons are learned. The whole nude thing is way overrated. Its not THAT shocking. The story and the way its played out is satisfying enough.",1136678400,8,932,4.502958579881657

As for the movie, it was incredibly dissapointing.  I feel awful that I even decided to pick this movie up, hoping that it would be halfway decent.  Needless to say, it was crap, and it wasn't worth spending twenty dollars for some crappy movie.  No wonder New Line wouldn't put it out in theaters!

I will commend Anne Hathaway for taking a chance though, and that's good that she's trying to expand her repertoire.  And I most certainly don't blame her for wanting to be typecast as ""that girl from the Princess Diaries.""  I believe that she really does have oscar potential, and I think that if she wanted to, she could do more dramatic roles.  I just think that the movie in general was just awful.  I honestly think that Anne should rethink roles like this before she decides to jump in just because she doesn't only want to be known as a good girl.

And Anne, if you happen to stumble upon my post here, I congratulate you on taking a risk, but take a closer at the script in your hand before jumping into roles like these.  I honestly believe that you can do better.  Way, way better.",1136419200,6,1221,4.353982300884955

2411156,2,B000BBOUUE,"Don't blame the actors. They all excelled at the parts they were given. Yet, when I sat down to watch ""Havoc"", I expected the edginess of ""Traffic"", or the rawness of ""Crash"". I expected that at least a lesson be learned, if not by the characters, then by the viewers. But this film was no where near ""Crash"". In fact, burn is the word I was looking for. There was lots of potential to make this, at least, an emotionally compelling film, but it seemed to fizzle when it should have popped and vice versa.

This film, about teenagers with too much time and money and not enough hobbies, cultural intelligence, or parental presence, features the life of Allison, suprisingly and well-convincingly played by Disney alumni Anne Hathaway. She's a rich kid in the Pacific Palisades who ""chills with her posse"", a group of other  rich kids who embrace their version of ""ganstas life"". She and her best friend Emily (played by Bijou Phillips) boldly enter a world they are intrigued by but know very little about; a real-life East L.A. gang. Suffice to say, Allison ultimately comes to her senses and heeds to her own inhibitions, but is it too late to prevent the consenquences that her actions may have set in motion?

In theory, Havoc is a good story to be told. It attempts to give an honest look into the life and times of almost any given modern teenager with modest resources. However, it felt as if the film never truly fully committed to much of anything, be it the plot, authenticity of the characters, or even an ending where the viewers didn't feel left in the cold, as if the filmmaker was saying, ""Kids will be kids."" This movie was equivalent to taking your SATs and never getting your scores back. Ever. I guess to some people, that IS havoc.",1135728000,5,1751,4.570063694267516
2411157,4,B000BBOUUE,"Inevitably, the real story of the movie HAVOC is the dramatic turn for Anne Hathaway from Disney poster child to sexually agressive gangsta chick. Many have criticized the poor girl for this dramatic turn... but you know what... there are a lot of things that seperate the successful from the forgotten in Hollywood... but ONE MAJOR THING IS GUTS! With Havoc, Anne proves that she is overflowing with it.

Many other women have taken this turn in the past, and probably have had to listen to the same criticizisms... just to list a couple... Jane Seymour and more importantly, another former Disney childstar named JODIE FOSTER... who has done alright for herself too, by making BOLD and GUTSY decisions herself.

In Havoc, she is a completely different person and she really gets to act out and flesh out a character with bite, vive and sexual curiosity that made get her in deeper than she really is ready for.

I give this movie 4 stars, because to me, this movie is more about Anne Hathaway taking an aggressive step with her career than the movie itself. Her first big step landed her in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN... the most critically acclaimed film of the year. SEE YOU AT THE OSCARS ANNE.

Okay, the movie...  The movie is okay, but not much more than that. It's basically about a couple of bored upperclass white sociallites who are unable to resist the bad boys. Their sexual curiosity seems to pull them towards a very dangerous drug dealing and murdering latino gang. How far will they go to satisfy their curiosity?

The performances are good, but there was one very very very important thing that ruined the movie for me. And 'no' it isn't because of the scene with Anne Hathaway. But, the gang leader, Hector (Played well by Freddy Rodriquez), is too soft.

From what I understand, this movie is not so far fetched. These things are actually happening in L.A. Yet, it's the Latino gangs who are KIDNAPPING white women and abusing them against their wills. Yet, in Havoc, the white women COME TO THEM and I felt like the way his character fleshed out was unrealistic and took away from the point of the movie.

In my opinion, the movie had a great premise, but didn't deliver where it should have, and I don't fault the actors, I fault the direction. Tension could have been fleshed out more. The fear and the danger of gang life could have been fleshed out more. Because of these things, the movie is only a 2 star movie.

On the other hand, Anne Hathaway proved that she can become a completely different character and proved that she's gonna be an actor that's gonna be around for time to come. Not to mention, increased her drool factor. That's why I give the movie as a whole 4 stars.",1135641600,5,2697,4.602083333333334

One feels a bit of sympathy, though, for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, since ""Mysterious Skin"" revealed that he could act, but he is here defeated by the worst of the dialogue, makeup, and direction.",1134950400,5,666,4.850877192982456
2411159,3,B000BBOUUE,"Obviously the main draw of this DVD is the fact that Anne Hathaway appears 'nude'. However, if your expecting all out full-frontal nudity and borderline porno scenes with Hathaway---think again. Several scenes (most notably the one with Hathaway and Philips in the bedroom) had oh so much potential, but in the end there are simply a few scenes of Hathaway topless. (a lot more of Philips)

Now, on to the movie...

This is an interesting topic to make a film about...wiggers AKA white kids with too much time and money. Ironically the term is mostly used by white people to label other white people. Anyways, THIS particular film did not achieve anything spectacular. The story begins with 2 'crews' arguing with each other and introduces us to the PTC (Hathaway's crew). The story itself is not very interesting (white kids go to the hood and get involved with a gang), but, surprisingly, the film is entertaining to watch.

The character's themselves (in the beginning) were a little to close to 'Malibu's Most Wanted' to fully embrace this movie as a drama and care about them. Also, as the story progresses, not enough effort is put into learning about or developing the characters. (More details about Hathaway's character in the beginning would have been great)This is unfortunate becuase later in the film, it would have been helpful to care a little more about these people. The characters really only start to become more than two dimensional in the last 25 minutes or so. Anne Hathaway and Bijou Philips were good on screen together and had the most authentic feeling relationship in the entire movie.

Overall, this film definitely had potential to be a good film and could have been done wonders with a few more plot intricacies and more character development. But, as is, I would RENT this movie instead of purchasing it.",1134604800,164,1835,4.871794871794871
2411160,3,B000BBOUUE,"Many films try to get inside the teenage mind. What makes kids have sex with guys they just met an hour earlier at a party? Or for them to try out drugs and drink till they pass out? Quite frankly I don't want to know. I never was interested in that kind of lifestyle but many are. Havoc tries to get into that mind, in particular the odd subculture of the wigga, meaning rich white kids trying to be gangster and street. The premise is intriguing but ugh it goes nowhere.

Allison(a regrettably miscast Anne Hathaway) is one of those rich white girls who leads a boring life. Since nothing exciting happens she joins an odd subculture called wiggers, where they try to be like a gang, even with their own name. On a ride to get weed with her friend Emily(Bijou Phillips, who oddly seems comfortable in these roles) and boyfriend, things go awry when the boyfriend accuses the dealer Hector(an unrecognizable Freddy Rodriguez from Six Feet Under). Oddly Allison develops a fascination with it.

This grows even more when she keeps following him around and doing what I call the accidental stalker.(""oh what are you doing here?"") comes to mind, since you knew they were there. Anyways Allison and her friend want in only they go through a ritual involving sex and numbers on a dice. Things don't go as planned and they all get a reality check.

Of course one of the big draws of the film isn't the message of the film, but rather star Anne Hathaway disrobes. 3 times actually. She's a bit miscast since after going from Princess Diaries to this it's too much of a change. Other actresses do sort of serious work gradually and then do a 180 role and we accept it since it's not a change. Here it's like Disney......to being naked and giving oral sex in the back of a car. The other actors do their part well but there's not really any standouts, except maybe Freddy Rodriguez. Of course my highlight is Shiri Appleby. Just her face is enough to keep me entertained. Lamentably she doesn't have a whole lot of screen time.

The one issue that I have is the ending. It's so truncated, sudden and leaves you with a feeling of emptiness. There's not a real closure for any of the characters and their fates are never dealt with. This might tie into the feeling of their fates aren't determined just like life but this is either lazy filmmaking or wannabe artsiness.

I can understand the idea behind the film which is teenagers tend to go towards something that is not always the best idea so the message gets across, just not the film itself.",1134172800,9,2537,4.518518518518518

I am boycotting all releases by this studio henceforth and if you're considering wasting your money on this garbage, consider this: i pre-ordered mine for alot less than i thought i'd have to pay for it, but returned it without opening it, after viewing it from Netflix (the GREATEST of all-time!)

2411163,1,B000BBOUUE,"This movie just plain stunk.  Granted the whole ""Rich kids acting tough"" idea is probably a little more true than you'd like.  But the movie itself really didn't provide much in the way of a story that most would care about.

The basic premise is just what I mentioned, rich kids wanting drugs and going to ""the hood"" (hispanic version of it), Hathway and Bijou & assorted boyfriends go for drugs, boyfriends act tough and get put in their place, girls go back later because they want to ""act bad"" and get more than they hope for, with assorted stretched out lame story line.

Lets be honest, most who are looking to this movie have done so because ""The Princess"" is getting nude.  Infact you probably read about how nude she really gets from the view shown at the film festival.  Well whatever nudity she may have had is down to a couple boob shots and a brief nipple shot and that's it.  The reports of her showing stuff down south is not here, and any ""activities"" done down south ain't in it the move either.  There were a couple potential areas where you could see where some potential was there for some hot action, but they got the ""alternate ending"".  Anyways if you want to see it for a naked Anne Hathway look online, the still shots posted everywhere are about as good as it gets.

PS Don't listen to the default ""user"" review listed on the page, it's a premade review made by someone (maybe the company) trying to hype the film, look at any other site selling the movie you'll see the same exact review.  The movie is not that good.",1134000000,16,1544,4.401408450704225
2411164,2,B000BBOUUE,"We'll I guess some people are more gullible than others to swallow such an average flick and call ""Independent"" and ""Edgy"" well this film is not that, nor does it break any ground with the teen drama department.

What it basically boils down is Anne playing Allison, a spoiled brat, who thinks she's invincible to pain. Her boyfriend and her think their big shots and do drugs and whatever.

Then her boyfriend gets cheated by a Mexican drug dealer, the dealer, pulls out a gun and her boyfriend pees his pants!!!!

Yes that's really edgy film-making..not!!! Again if you read this review and disagree then you're just ignoring the truth but I digress.

(Spoilers don't read unless you want to know what will happen)

Anyhow Hathaway's character is more of a rich slut than a troubled teen, she seems to get joy out of manipulating people along with her other fluzy friends.

She's infatuated with the Mexican drug dealer, I guess becomes she digs his male machismo, and stuff and wants to get into his gang as does her white friend Emily.

They get in sort of, but when it comes down to the ""initiation"" which entails banging the dude's friend, Allison backs out but her friend stays showing her exhibition desires. Anyhow she ridiculous cries rape later when in fact she had sex with one of the gang members.

Allison at one point gets busted with the gang members but is bailed by her yuppie like parents who think the strictest punishment is to ""ground her"" (yeah that'll work for spoiled brat, how about taking away her cash and money).

Allison finds out about Emily's ""rape"" but she betrays her friends and says it wasn't rape.

Later near the last ten minutes her cowardly boyfriend gets his friends together and gets some firearms all the way videotaping the process (yes this guy has lettuce for brains) and planning revenge on the Mexican dealer from before and you can pretty much guess where it's headed after this.

This movie as you can see if you have read by this point, is predictable, boring, and not at all ""edgy"" or ""intense"", I've seen so many of these wannabee gang movies, I could make my own and call myself a director.

However, let's get a few positive in here. The acting for the most part (without the cussing) is pretty good, and Hathaway does take the role seriously which I imagine was a test given the laughable material she had to work and playing the brat, her ""friends"" in this movie were OK but none of them will win Oscars for their work here.

The storyline is repetitive and it just seemed to drag on and on except when it got to the obvious gratuitous sex and violence. Overall though still it's a disappointment, I can't believe Roeper recommended it as it's not that good. The characters are not really unlikable nor sympathetic.

But if you're a Hathaway fan, I'am sure you'll love it. If you're mad after reading this review, get over it, there better movies out there involving the same genre.",1133913600,3,2939,4.616122840690979

There is little nudity.  A few topless shots, and that's it.

The ending is weak.

2411166,4,B000BBOUUE,"Anne Hathaway plays a rich LA teen who seems to have it all, but for all the excess is deeply troubled and disassociated.  She convinces her girlfriend to go on a ride with her to downtown East LA to hook up with some hot gang members she knows of. Seems she has quite the hots for one of them.  Of course they run into serious trouble, which unfolds rather quickly.  I'd recommend the movie, if only for the shock of seeing Anne (Princess Diaries) Hathaway in a total out of character and very risque role.",1133740800,2,507,4.315789473684211

2411168,2,B000BBOUUE,"If there is some justice to misjudging investments in movies, then the fact that this film went directly to DVD despite the presence of a crew that includes some impressive names is notable.  Writer Stephen Gaghan  ('Traffic', 'Rules of Engagement', 'Syriana', etc) has composed a contrived script about rich, bored, Hip Hop imitating, unmotivated teenagers trying to spice up their insignificant lives by treading into the East LA 'danger zone', an experience from which they learn nothing about cross cultural ethnic groups and just return to Pacific Palisades whining about 'damaged goods'.  It is an insulting story, one that stereotypes Hispanics as drug-peddling, raping thugs in a totally black and white manner, not taking into consideration the viewpoint of a cultural group's positive attributes and philosophies.

No longer a viable gimmick, the film begins with the tired clich of a kid making a documentary about his friends, asking what they like and don't like, their goals, their outlooks. The fact that none of the interviewees has a clue about life, preferring to follow the current Hip Hop language (very poorly written) and focusing on sex, drugs, and escapes from their wealthy environments. Among these are three girls, the main character being Allison (Anne Hathaway, miscast in every way), who follow their superficial boyfriends on a joyride for drugs into East LA. There they meet Hector (Freddy Rodrguez, trying his best to create a character without the benefit of a decent script) who sells them drugs and whom Allison eyes. Allison is so shallow she doesn't have a clue about her motivations, just wanting something 'dangerous' to happen. She coaxes her equally clueless girlfriends into going into East LA to seduce Hector and ends up in a ridiculous barter for joining Hector's gang (no mention is made at all about the Chicanas who would never allow these three geeks to enter their territory unchallenged). The results of a barter results in an experience with which the girls cannot cope so they run back to the protection of the dysfunctional parents they loathe to cover the mess of their caper. Attempts to resolve this dumb story fail pathetically.

With so many fine Indie films that go begging for attention, it is a shame money is wasted on this sort of meaningless mess of a film. The 'unrated' designation is probably meant for the occasional nudity and gratuitous sex and language, but here 'Unrated' might just mean that the film is so without merit that it is non-classifiable. Avoid this one and don't think that a fine writer such as Gaghan guarantees a successful story. Grady Harp, December 05",1133740800,5,2644,5.055045871559633
