8717560,1,B00Y67XNIY,This fitness program in not original but a hybrid of Yoga and Ti-chi that had been around for thousands of years. Credit to the author for creating the fusion between these two disciplines.,1493337600,,189,4.757575757575758
8717561,5,B00Y67XNIY,"My wife & I use this to supplement our fitness program of weight work, spinning & yoga.  The emphasis of slower movements & technique is helpful in your stretches and results.  She blends movements from Tai Chi, Flow Yoga & stretches from her ballerina training. In our mid-60's, this is a great DVD series for all fitness levels, especially those just starting out.

Yes, Miranda sometimes chats a bit much, particularly in the 30 minute sessions. And yes she does not keep everything counted perfectly but its part of her charm. You get the sense that she understands the effects of aging.  She's really working to get your body moving which is a big part of fitness in older years.  We highly recommend it.",1483747200,2,709,4.685483870967742
8717562,4,B00Y67XNIY,"It's a great stretching routine and has really helped. I've also started the weight loss segment, which is truly low impact, but effective, I believe. The only thing that bothers me is that she spends time talking while I am waiting for the next instruction, and the exercises are not symmetrical...that is she may do 3 on one side and 4 on the next, or some moves may not even been repeated on both sides. Her count is often off on the exercise video. It's just a little unusual for an exercise routine.",1483574400,4,504,4.43010752688172
8717563,3,B00Y67XNIY,"Helpful but her instructions seem somewhat random. Also, the different workouts all seem similar. A little over priced I think.",1476316800,,127,5.4
8717564,4,B00Y67XNIY,"The stretches are easy enough and effective, but sometimes she moves to the next exercise unexpectedly and throws me off a bit, but I catch back up eventually. :)",1475193600,,162,4.620689655172414
8717565,4,B00Y67XNIY,Videos can quickly but one did not work.  was able to contact seller & nedw one was sent out immediately.  New one worked fine.  No propblems otherwise,1475107200,,151,4.518518518518518
8717566,4,B00Y67XNIY,"I found a copy of this set on eBay and I must say it contains nothing new.  If you own any of the other Classical Stretch DVDs, this is no different.  I have Seasons 9, 10 and 11 and the workouts in Aging Backwards are nothing different.",1471651200,9,237,4.0212765957446805
