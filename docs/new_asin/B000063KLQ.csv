7959668,3,B000063KLQ,"'A Dirty Little Businness' (known as Merchants Of Venus in some countries) is barely known in the UK. Filmed in 1998, and released on DVD four years later. The film is a low budget romantic comedy written by Len Richmond who also wrote the award-winning sitcom 'Agony'. Filmed in Los Angeles, the impressive cast has Michael York and former Bond girl and Sweeney bird Prunella Gee (who was still a looker even in her late 40s) as the leads, and wonderful supporting characters played by Beverly D' Angelo and Brian Cox. The movie, lacking in music, has at least one good song with a track called 'Love Affair' by '80s pop sensation Erasure.

The story is an unusual one, Russian immigrant Alex (York) comes to Los Angeles with big ideas, only to land a job in a sex toy factory. The boss, Eppy (played by a wonderful actress called Nancy Fish who steals many of the scenes) mothers Alex and tries to set him up with a friend of her's, has-been adult movie star Catherine (Gee). Cynical Catherine doesn't believe in true love and Alex tries hard to make her change her mind. A sweet love affair begins and York and Gee definitely have chemistry. Things soon become more complicated, when Alex byes the sex factory, and lands himself into hot water.

The main problem with this film (and why I only rate it three stars) is that it tries to deal with too much too quickly, all of the subjects that it tries to tackle can not be done in only 74 minutes. I think it could have been done better had it been given it more time and attention. The ending is rather disappointing and large chunks of the film leave holes behind it. Had parts not been so rather hastily thrown together, this could have actually been a great film.

In parts, the film is very funny, and there are also good performances all around. Like most low budget straight-to-DVD movies, at the price that it is usually sold for, you can't go wrong really.

Note: There are no subtitles, and sometimes they would have helped as the sound is sometimes not all that clear, but generally, you can hear the actors.",1420243200,,2071,4.514666666666667
7959669,5,B000063KLQ,Very interesting take on the Porn industry and what it takes to survive the politics and undeserved attacks on theis products.,1418860800,,126,5.0476190476190474
7959670,3,B000063KLQ,"Its an oddball movie with some strange acting and story telling. It is watchable from what I remember (the bosses insisted we watch it to see what the company warehouse use to look like...and to see who use to work there, as they were used as extras in the background) The weapon used by Michael York in the last third of the movie was sold by the Adult Lotion and Toy Company I worked for. Just don't spend too much for this movie unless you are a big fan of Michael York. Note...the director is the son of the owner of the Adult Company.",1374537600,,539,4.1923076923076925
7959671,1,B000063KLQ,this movie was not worth the money. cheaply make and story line fall way short,1208044800,2,78,4.266666666666667
7959672,4,B000063KLQ,Seeing Michael York holding a giant dildoe (and I mean giant) on his first day's work at a sex toy factory had me laughing till my sides hurt. This is an edgy independent movie that really takes chances. It's the first and only film I've seen that took me into the sex toy industry (realistically) and showed the daily lives of the Russian and Hispanic immigrants that work there (York plays a Russian). Beverly D' Angelo is classic as a porno actress who weilds a whip but has a lisp! I've loaned it to my friends and they all thought it was hysterical. A very entertaining film. I love Erasure and they wrote the original musical score.,1126569600,6,638,4.461538461538462
