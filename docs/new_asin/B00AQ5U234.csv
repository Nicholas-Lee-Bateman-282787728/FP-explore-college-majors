5468530,3,B00AQ5U234,"This could have been a really good movie had the filmmakers been able to settle on what they wanted it to be, and run with it. When it's sweet, it's very sweet, like when Drew Barrymore sings ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" at the top of her lungs while painting her father's garage because she's so smitten with Adam Sandler, or when she says ""there's nothing like a first kiss"" after they kiss for what she thinks is the first time--in three successive scenes that take place on three successive days. When it's bittersweet, or just plain sad, it actually manages to pull that off as well, though I won't give details here, so as not to spoil the plot. When it's stupidly funny, it's pretty stupid, and occasionally quite funny--how could it be otherwise, with Rob Schneider as a native Hawaiian; Sean Astin as a lisping, steroid-abusing idiot; an Eastern European of indeterminate gender; and a gigolo walrus? But all these things really don't work so well together in the same movie, except perhaps for the scene where Sandler serenades Barrymore on his ukulele at the aquarium (""You cracked your head like Gary Busey / Forgetful Lucy"").
I read somewhere that, given the plot device of Lucy's short-term memory loss, this could have been another ""Groundhog Day""--that I'm not sure about. Strangely enough, I found the plot of ""50 First Dates"" *less* plausible than that of ""Groundhog Day,"" if only because the latter makes total sense if you're willing to grant that Bill Murray really is reliving one day over and over, whereas although losing one's short-term memory is entirely possible in the real world, the behavior of Lucy's friends and family is quite bizarre and illogical at times. However, this could have been a very solid romantic comedy if they had ditched the walrus vomit, ""It's Pat"" redux, and pretty much all of Sean Astin and Rob Schneider (though I do have to say, the scene in which he's chased down by Barrymore and beaten with a bat is as funny as it looks in the trailer).
As it is, it's neither here nor there, so it disappoints on both counts. *Might* be worth it for a weekend matinee--probably better to wait, and rent it when it comes out on DVD.",1076716800,3,2169,4.680628272251309

Story is about a woman who loses her short term memory on a daily bases after a car accident, and a guy who normally is a playboy falls for this woman as he enjoyed the challenge to feel like he's dating her for the first time each time being that she thinks it's always her first time meeting him.  It may seem unbelievable, but it's not much different than dementia.  Plus, I have seen a friend who fell down the stairs and couldn't remember any short term memories that happened that entire day.  Adam Sandler plays a vet at a Hawaiian aquarium.  It was nice that this movie was filmed on location in Hawaii.  Beautiful place with nice people, and cool reference to Hawaiians' love for SPAM.",1519603200,,764,4.414285714285715

Have a half a dozen shots of a kooky penguin! Here! Have a barfing walrus! Here! Have a joke about spam! The cookie-cutter ""island"" setting is as shallow as the characters, both intended to be colorful but rather drowning in cliche for lack of any substance.

I want to say that I am not a huge fan of Adam Sandler. I think most of his movies there isn't much meat. There are some very good supporting players in this including Dan Ackroid. It is my favorite Adam Sandler movie.

I am also not a huge fan of rom com movies but the centeral theme in this story is both serious and touching at the same time. The comedy helps lighten up the story. It kind of reminds me a little bit of the movie where Kevin James plays the zoo keeper as Adam Sandler is a marine scientist and a bit like Ground hog day. For that reference I invite you to watch this touching movie that is funny yet dramatic at the same time.

I like this movie as it is full of hope and love. This is a great movie. Might be great even for date night ",1511568000,,969,3.953846153846154

5468590,5,B00AQ5U234,"Nothing like a movie that can work its angles on the rom-com genre with such spot on material and deftly executed skill as to make a regular straight guy FORGET that he's watching a rom-com... From my lips to god's ears: since this first came out I've probably ended up re-watching it twice a year, every year...

As far as the Barrymore-Sandler pairing goes, in general? Well, they'll never be confused with Hepburn-Tracey... But I do believe that this film has a sort of ""Groundhog Day"" quality that will make it a *go-to-again-and-again* flick that lots of people who are normally one-off movie watchers will enjoy for years.

Incidentally, for the uninitiated: these two were also great in ""The Wedding Singer."" It's not on that I look for to watch over again--but I don't object to it if someone I'm around tees it up on the telly. I know they did others. But the fact that no titles spring to mind reflects the imression they didn't make on me.",1508889600,2,950,4.615384615384615

Then he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). After an accident she has lost her ability to transfer short term memory to log term. So every day since the accident is erased and she starts over. So the relationship starts from an bet and ends up who knows where if any where.

At first it the film looks just like any old Adam Sandler film that only Sandlerights could like. Then it settles down to cute. Then it settles down to meaningful, finally you forget that you are watching a movie and then it is over. Drew excels in this movie and is very believable.

The film would have come off a lot better with out all the Sandleright left over characters that contributed zip to the story. The two that came to mind is the brother Doug Whitmore (Sean Astin). And the what-not Alexa (Lusia Strus.)

This a very cute romantic movie and the patience of one man to help his true love remember and recapture lost memories of their relationship.
Every date is her first date because she does not remember her boyfriend the next day due to a traumatic accident that happened to her.
In one scene he state this is our 20th date and she does not remember the other 20 dates .  He asks her : When are you going to kiss me?

5468638,5,B00AQ5U234,"It's probably ridiculous to rate a movie that already has had so many reviews, but after watching it, I still felt compelled to do it anyway. This is a fun, emotional movie about love and what people will do for those they love. How can you not like that? The concept of a girl with no short-term memory is kind of the flip side of Groundhog Day, where only she relives the same day and everyone else around her work (at least in the beginning) to give her a similar experience each day after she awakes. It;s fun and the quirky characters are great fun.

Drew Barrymore is a girl anyone could visually fall in love with, especially in this movie. Just her smile pulls you in and grabs you. Of course, given her family talent, her acting is wonderful.

Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Adam Sandler. The first few movies I saw him in left me cold. But then something happened. I started seeing him in romantic comedies and found a) he could act and b) he was likable in the roles. This is another of those roles where he does a great job ion creating a likable character. As with most comedians, he has great timing.

The movie fits the perfect definition of romantic comedy for those who love the genre. There's joy and sadness mixed throughout.

The ending to the movie isn't the one I would have absolutely wanted to see. That said, if I couldn't have that, this one made sense and brought everything full circle in an emotional and believable way. Too many people rate things based on what they would have wanted...movies like this should be reviewed for what they gave us.",1477353600,,1578,4.431034482758621

5468642,5,B00AQ5U234,"The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: Henry Roth lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment.
Then he meets Lucy Whitmore. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn't even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn't overly stupid, but it's not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film's true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to Henry who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with Lucy, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. Henry's character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with Lucy, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn't really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn't even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended.",1474243200,,1609,4.402684563758389

I was completely unprepared for how beautifully touching the story is. It is, in many different ways, the ultimate love story. From the devoted dad and brother and the family friends who are prepared to spend the rest of their lives pretending it's the same day over and over, to the reformed Cassanova who finally realizes what it means to truly love another person, to the girl who shows us that love is so powerful it can live in us even when we can't remember who or why we love-who could ask for more? In fact I will ask for less-less Rob Schneider that is. I get the point of his character but that point could have been made in half the screen time. It's a small glitch in an otherwise delightful movie.",1457654400,,847,4.234567901234568

Seriously, I think Adam Sandler is immature and sometimes borderline vile, but I really liked him in this.  Drew Barrymore is just so much fun to watch.  She clearly is a woman who knows her own mind, at least for a day.  She has been the victim of an accident, so each morning when she wakes up, It is the same day over again. It is kind of like Groundhog day, only it isn't really the same day, and she is the only one who does not know that.  She has a tough, but amazing father and a deeply insecure brother.  This is a very sweet story. Drew Barrymore is perfect in the role, and even Adam Sandler works.  I liked it so much, I bought the bluray.",1425859200,,777,3.967741935483871

5468819,4,B00AQ5U234,"I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a huge Adam Sandler fan.  I find most of his movies crude, juvenile, and needlessly mean-spirited, and I'm not a fan of his style of humor.  I did, however, enjoy ""The Wedding Singer,"" which was actually a very sweet movie thanks to both Drew Barrymore's presence and Sandler toning down his act somewhat.  I wasn't sure what to expect of ""50 First Dates,"" but seeing as it featured another team-up between these two actors, I was willing to give it a shot.  If nothing else, Sandler and Barrymore had a sweet sort of chemistry, which could hopefully counter some of Sandler's grosser antics.

While there are still a few gross-out gags and plenty of physical humor, ""50 First Dates"" isn't a typical Sandler film.  It's unexpectedly sweet, and actually quite emotional at times.

Sandler plays Henry, a veterinarian working at a marine park in Hawaii, who is notorious for his one-night stands and multiple flings with women he will never see again.  When he spies Barrymore's character -- Lucy, a goofy but sweet art teacher -- in a restaurant, he approaches her and the two hit it off unexpectedly well... but he's baffled when she doesn't seem to remember him at all the next day.  Turns out that a year before their meeting, a car accident left Lucy without the ability to create new memories, and she's perpetually stuck in the past.  Lucy's friends and family ensure that everything stays exactly the same as the day of her accident in the hopes of not traumatizing her, and Henry is encouraged to avoid growing attached to her.  But Henry isn't about to give up, and he'll go to great lengths to make Lucy fall for him... even if it means winning her heart over and over and over again.

The premise of the film could have been played entirely for comedy, and it does have plenty of funny moments -- mostly physical gags, such as Lucy chasing down Henry's friend (played by a nearly-unrecognizable Rob Schneider) with a  baseball bat.  But the gross-out gags are kept few and far between, with more focus being given to the burgeoning relationship between the two leads and Lucy's struggle with her condition.  It's also rather sweet and touching, and even has some genuinely emotional moments, especially in the latter half of the film.  Adam Sandler can actually be a decent actor without relying on his usual idiotic schtick and body-function humor, and it would be nice to see him do more films of this nature.  Barrymore is both awkward and adorable, and generates some genuine pathos for her character's plight.  Most of the other actors play their roles well but aren't particularly memorable, though Rob Schneider is hilarious as Henry's friend (though why they have a white actor playing a Hawaiian native I can only speculate) and Dan Aykroyd makes an enjoyable cameo as a neuro-physician.

There's also quite a bit of gorgeous scenery in this film, given that it's set in Hawaii.  Funny enough, the film's setting actually does seem to benefit the plot -- it would be a lot harder for Lucy's family to maintain the charade of every day being the same if the film took place in a temperate climate where the seasons actually visibly change.  The location wasn't just chosen for eye candy, evidently.

An enjoyable and unexpected Sandler film, this is probably my favorite of Sandler's movies, next to ""The Wedding Singer.""  He really should ease up on the ""disgusting man-child"" act and make more films like this, as he's shown he's capable of being a decent actor when he tries.",1418083200,,3536,4.741830065359477
5468820,4,B00AQ5U234,I bought this movie it's so different and sweet and a very good escape movie. I was able to overlook the language and I didn't like the son's character or the assistant at the zoo but if you chew the hay and spit out the stubble it's good and beautiful scenery.  I didn't realize Drew Baremore was so beautiful when she was young. She's still good looking but she was beautiful. I like Adam Sandler his character was great after he met Lucy and I didn't care for his buddy's Character either but I guess it's worth it because I just watched it again today.

5468825,5,B00AQ5U234,"50 First Dates is a romantic comedy about a womanizing veterinarian that fell in love with an amnesiac.

Henry Roth is a womanizer who is glad with his lifestyle of non- commitment. Then he meets Lucy and falls for her. She decides win her heart and give up his lifestyle. Unfortunately,trouble begins when he realizes that Lucy is suffering from a Goldfield's Syndrome,a short-term memory impairment. But nevertheless,Henry is determined and Lucy's disability does not stop him despite the obstacles he has to overcome and the difficulties that it ensues. Will Henry eventually give up in the end or will love truly conquer everything?

This is a enjoyable and entertaining movie. The chemistry of Sandler and Barrymore definitely helps as well as the charm they bring together. Added to that,there are a lot of comedic scenes that will truly elicit lots of laughter to the viewer. Despite the fact some seemed over- the-top,we will be delighted to realize in the end what true love is really all about as it points it out to anyone watching this film.",1416700800,,1053,4.910112359550562

I liked him much better in this movie where he is acting like a normal person and talking like a normal person.  I have to admit that I did laugh that we see him give a nod to Happy Gilmore!

The idea of a woman who forgets everything every morning when she wakes up, but still captures the heart of Adam Sandler regardless is pretty interesting.  Everyone goes to all these lengths to make her comfortable because they all care a lot about her and want her to be happy.  Adam plays a guy who is willing to go to extraordinary lengths to make her happy and to win her heart every day so she will be with him.  And frankly it's a great movie!

5468833,5,B00AQ5U234,"Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a Veterinarian and a romantic soul who is totally afraid of commitment. Fortunately, he lives in Hawaii, which affords him the opportunity to date lovely tourists, giving them the romantic time of their lives before bidding them farewell as they return home.

Then one day, while having breakfast at the Hukilau Cafe after his boat breaks down, he becomes completely enchanted by Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) as he watches her create an amazing volcano out of her breakfast waffles and syrup. He can't resist the urge to meet her and when he does, the sparks between them are strong.

Henry has no choice but to come to terms with the fact that his greatest fear has just been realized: He has fallen in love with a local girl. Despite his misgivings, Henry returns to the cafe the next day to meet her for breakfast again, only to find out that Lucy doesn't remember him at all.

Henry soon learns that, due to a head injury, Lucy is suffering from the fictitious condition of Goldfield Syndrome - a form of amnesia. Every night when she falls asleep, her short term memory is wiped clean, causing her to wake up the next day believing it is her father's birthday from over a year before - the day she was injured.

Unfortunately, Henry is hooked. Despite her condition, he cannot walk away from Lucy. But how can he have a relationship with a woman who can't remember who he is?

50 First Dates is one of my favorite movies. First off, I'm a big Adam Sandler fan and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I like them all - yes, even Little Nicky. (Please don't judge me.) I love watching to see how many of his normal band of miscreants will turn up in his movies, and what roles they will play. This movie does not disappoint.

Rob Schneider is there, as his odd sidekick Ula, a married native Hawaiian with a pile of adorable children who are all much more talented than he is. Blake Clark is wonderful as Marlin Whitmore - Lucy's protective and loving father. Allen Covert makes a memorable appearance as Ten Second Tom, a man with much more serious (and funny) memory issues than Lucy. Peter Dante has a small role as a security guard and manages to steal the scene with only a couple of lines.

Dan Aykroyd is wonderful in the role of Lucy's doctor, a man who sometimes wishes his wife had Goldfield Syndrome: ""That way she wouldn't remember last night when I called her mother a loud, obnoxious drunk with a face like J. Edgar Hoover's ass.""

And Sean Astin is absolutely ridiculous and wonderful as Lucy's brother, Doug, a lisping steroid-riddled body builder type who needs a lot of help - a character of Sean's own creation.

As is often the case with Adam Sandler movies, there is a fair amount of very adult-oriented humor. If this is something that concerns you as a parent, this movie might be one to watch after the kiddos have gone to bed for the night.

What is truly special about 50 First Dates, however, is that when you get past all the silliness and fun, you have an absolutely wonderful romantic story about a man so devoted to his woman that every day, he does whatever he can to show his love and be in her presence. If everyone loved each other like that - this world would be transformed.

What would you do for the one you love?",1413158400,3,3279,4.466555183946488

Where does the love go when the other person is deemed mentally insufficient?  This movie shows how a persons true love for another can overcome that issue.  I have never been a Sandler fan, however this movie (and subsequently Blended) turned that around.

Overall, this film was one of star Adam Sandler's better projects...not too many disgusting jokes and Rob Schneider actually had a significant role as opposed to just being in the movie for the sake of showing up in an Adam Sandler movie...I actually really liked his performance as the Hawaiian pothead best friend...he was really amusing.  Blake Clark also had a significant role, playing the father of the film's love interest, played by Drew Barrymore.  Sean Astin played her brother and he also was pretty funny...along the same lines as Rob Schneider but without the accent.  In fact, the whole movie was pretty good and had a number of humorous moments.  As I might have said, it's one of Adam Sandler's better pictures and actually throws some legitimate drama at us every so often.

This is the story of a womanizing marine veterinarian who is willing to give up his meaningless one-night stands for a woman whose short-term memory only lasts for one day. The screenplay has its raunchy moments, particularly early on, but it is easily redeemed by a uniquely refreshing premise. The real force of the film is Drew Barrymore. She crafts a character who is strong, joyous, vulnerable, and tragically challenged. While maintaining this believable balance, she delivers some of the funniest moments with wonderful aplomb. Sandler offers a delightful performance through his character's growing love, compassion, and determination. This is a surprisingly unforgettable movie for those of us who choose to believe that there is always hope and who know that our best efforts are made all the better with a little humor.",1402790400,,908,5.100671140939597

5468905,4,B00AQ5U234,"Fifty First Dates is better than its premise. Yes, there are some implausibilities, which I will note in a moment. However, Adam Sandler does a great job as Henry Roth, a fellow who has the reputation of being the quintessential ""take 'em and leave 'em"" guy, but who falls in love with Lucy (Drew Barrymore), who has no memory from one day to the next, a result of a car accident a year earlier. (One cannot help but note the irony of his ongoing infatuation with someone who effectively dumps him every night and must be wooed again the next morning.)

Despite the obstacles in maintaining an ongoing relationship, Henry finds creative ways of ""meeting"" and establishing a relationship with Lucy day after day. Over time, their relationship grows and becomes a truly deep, permanent relationship.

One has to suspend one's disbelief at times. Lucy's brother and father a mission of protecting her from finding out about her condition. In order to do this, they do everything they can to recreate the day of her accident. The accident occurred on her father's birthday, and so every day they have a cake. She gives her dad the same present every day. And so forth. Moreover, her father somehow has had the foresight to buy hundreds of copies of the local newspaper with the date of his birthday on it, so that it appears to Lucy that it truly his birthday. In fact, given how much effort her father and brother put into perpetrating this ruse, one wonders how they find any time to work.

Despite these and other improbabilities, this is aheartwarming movie. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore both do a great job with their characters, and the chemistry between the two actors is excellent.",1379894400,2,1688,4.73469387755102

I almost gave up at the start, but this film had been given to me as a gift, and so I kept watching -- and I'm glad I did, because the heart of the film turned out to be a rich and rewarding story about love and human relationships. Don't get me wrong -- it is a comedy and it's fun, it's just more meaningful than most comedies. And that's what makes it special (and worth writing a review for).

Some comparison could be made to Groundhog Day (a great film) in the feel of this film. I wouldn't be surprised if the filmmakers admired GD.",1371772800,2,724,4.164285714285715

So IM A VERY CHEAP DATE! I joke! Because I could do the same thing over and over and NEVER REMEMBER DOING IT BEFORE! On the DOEN SIDE OF HAVING NO MEMOTY I must WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN LIKE NOTES AND SUCH TO REMEMBER IT!

This is a romantic comedy. A guy (Sandler) meets a girl (Barrymore) and falls for her. She has a problem, though. She has, as a result of an injury, no short term memory. As such, each time they meet, to her, is the first time. I think this movie is adorable, as well, as funny. I like to share this one. Very Highly Recommended.",1359590400,,551,4.3076923076923075

It is one of the funniest but also the most touching movies I've ever seen. I've watched it at least 20 times and I'm sure I'll watch it at least 20 more. Every member of the supporting cast is perfect. They took an unbelievable story and made it utterly believable at least for people like me. By the end of this movie I wanted to believe that with enough love they could make it work and the way it was handled made it possible for me to believe it. I can't say enough about the direction of this film. Just wonderful. Nothing is forced. It just flows. And, they didn't ""sell out"" or ""cater to the audience"" by creating a perfect ending with a ""cure"" for Lucy. Of course, choosing to set it in Hawaii was genius and the added touch of the animals at the sea world park was also genius.

The film somehow manages to be genuinely funny, heartwarming and sincere, overcoming Sandler's natural tendency to go for the cheap laughs. Drew Barrymore is wonderful as the adorable amnesiac who starts each day with a fresh slate. Adam Sandler plays the smitten admirer who wins her over, only to find he is completely forgotten the next day. And the next. And the next.

Rob Schneider is more irritating than funny, except for the scene where Drew beats the crap out of him, but the rest of the supporting cast is a joy to watch.

You'll smile. You'll laugh. And, believe it or not, you'll root for Adam Sandler.

Never having been a big Adam Sandler fan, and since the TV spots promoting the movie made it out to be a typically juvenile Sandler film, I almost skipped 50 First Dates. But then a friend recommended it, and I'm glad he did. Yes, there's the expected quotient of over-the-top goofiness, especially from Rob Schneider, but underneath it all is a charming love story that just keeps growing on you. In fact, I found myself reluctant to return the DVD. I ended up watching the last half hour again a few days later and liked it even more. I kept it longer still and just finished watching the whole movie again and upped my rating from four to five stars. It's rare that any film grows on me that way, but this one did. Get past the goofiness and you'll find a heartwarming story of a playboy who grows up in time to find the love of his life, and then, as karmic penance, is forced to make her fall in love with him all over again every day. If Ground Hog Day was cleverly amusing, 50 First Dates takes a similar conceit and makes it heartfelt and charming.

Her father paints the garage white everyday, 13th of October paper out, all the time. She always thinks it's Sunday, her husband is a stranger to her, every morning'. Well, that's '50 first dates'.

But its great how its a good message about how a guy goes from dating a ton of girls he never wanted to really keep up with but then falling for one women who keeps forgetting who he is :-) Love makes you do funny things.

The Adam Sandler character, Henry Roth, begins to develop some depth as a human being as he discovers the plight of the very lovely Lucy, begins to see her as something more than a sex object, and develops a concern for someone other than himself.

The movie takes place in Hawaii with all of the beautiful scenery you would expect in that locale. The casting is well done with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler both creating sympathetic characters about whom the viewer begins to care. The supporting roles are all performed with competence so that the total package is very rewarding.

Both the sound and video on the Blu-ray version are excellent so there are no complaints in that department.

There is course language and sexual innuendo especially in the beginning of the movie, and some scattered throughout but the later scenes are handled with less crudity.

Blake Clark and Sean Astin are terrific as, respectively, her father and brother, who sacrifice their lives to play along, resetting things at the end of every damn night, so that Lucy's life is made as uncomplicated as possible. No surprises for Lucy, goes the mandate. She wakes up to the same day, which is her father's birthday. But what's fair, really? And how do you toe that moral line between easing a devastating trauma and outright living a lie?

In steps Henry Roth, womanizing feller and yet sympathetic. Henry is a marine-life vet working at an aquatic park which means we're privy to amusing animal shenanigans with the walrus and the dolphins and such. Adam Sandler plays Henry as quite likable and I even buy that he falls so hard for Lucy that he foregoes his lecherous, commitment-phobic ways. And what strikes a girl's fancy swifter than the notion of a guy having to win the same girl every day all over again. As for the tone of the film, it's not as much that Sandler's leaning for crude frat-boy humor is toned down as much as it's mitigated by an underpinning of warmth. And, really, put that down to Drew Barrymore. As in THE WEDDING SINGER, Sandler and the marvelously expressive Barrymore demonstrate an irresistible chemistry. These two make a fun, fun couple.

Thing is, I'm still the kind of guy who busts a gut at sophomoric gags. I think Rob Scneider is awesome as Ula, Henry's good-natured but pretty messed-up assistant; he provides plenty of the belly laughs. Surprisingly, Sean Astin, not exactly acclaimed for the funny, is hilarious as Lucy's roided-up brother. Throw in Sandler's sweet ""Forgetful Lucy"" song and a great surprise ending, and 50 FIRST DATES crosses off key items on the checklist: a head-turning premise; a terrific cast; a winning romance; a touch of heartbreak; a picturesque tropical setting; and laugh-out-loud humor. And then there's Ten Second Tom. And you thought Lucy's plight was horrible...",1272067200,3,2358,4.84863523573201

5468991,5,B00AQ5U234,"50 first dates was one of the big romantic comedies of this year. It contains big actors and it had major marketing behind it. I'm pretty neutral when it comes to Adam Sandler because he has couple of decent comedies but many very bad also. Drew Barrymore has convinced me just once in a good comedy (The Wedding Singer), and that one time she acted with Adam Sandler so I started watching this movie with little expectation.  Movie was following pretty normal comedy line. It was made with certain formula, kind a like that it have to please a certain amount of audience. In itself it's not that bad thing, the movie was sometime funny but it didn't bring anything new to the comedy field. Also it shows that makers have to put a brake on some of the jokes just to keep the movie in that certain formula.(when they learn to make movies in more artistic way and less with dollar bills in their eyes --> I bet that the movies would be much better and they would have as much as audience than they have now, or ever more?) But now, back to the review:  I found 50 First dates a bit of sad movie. There are couples of things witch made tears in my eyes and made me feel sorry for the character. It might have been better idea to make a drama from the movie because it handles such a `dramatic?' subject. Memory loss might have been a funny idea in a text but at the latest at the filming the makers have understood that it really isn't that funny. So the result is that the movie is little confusing mixing basic Adam Sandler humor to the dramatic things. Somebody should have just leash Sandler and make an effort to make the movie a decent drama.  Although movie shows couple of pretty funny characters and couple of over top ones. There are also funny animal jokes and overall the movie runs pretty fluently. Idea of the film is interesting and not so often used. Adam Sandler is making a little tamed version of his usual `goofy' character and is giving an ok performance. Drew Barrymore is a real actress and gives her character a little more deep and realistic interpretation spiced with little sad tone. I liked it. Because this is a `Adam Sandler' movie it of course includes a funny beating scene and Rob Schneider in a funny minor role.",1253836800,2,2243,4.4

Then he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). After an accident she has lost her ability to transfer short term memory to log term. So every day since the accident is erased and she starts over. So the relationship starts from a bet and ends up who knows where if any where.

At first it the film looks just like any old Adam Sandler film that only Sandlerights could like. Then it settles down to cute. Then it settles down to meaningful, finally you forget that you are watching a movie and then it is over. Drew excels in this movie and is very believable.

The film would have come off a lot better with out all the Sandleright left over characters that contributed zip to the story. The two that came to mind is the brother Doug Whitmore (Sean Astin). And the what-not Alexa (Lusia Strus.)

Another warning is that the version of DVD had a bunch of coming attractions after paying good money I do not need forced attractions at the beginning. Wait for a better release or just press the ""Menu"" button to escape them.

Adam Sandler plays a player, but falls in love with Drew Barrymore, who has a brain disorder as a result of a car accident. She can remember only one day at a time. A marine biologist, Sandler (yes, he's Henry Roth, but really, he's Sandler playing the best Sandler of any of his movies where he's also playing Sandler). Instead of being bored meeting and leaving his next conquest, he focuses all his attention on this sweet young woman who cannot remember him the next day--a real challenge to a player. Her innocence triggers something deep inside and he actually falls in love with her.

Every time she sees him, it is the ""first"" time she meets him. He is forced to woo her without the usual payoff at the end of the date. His dream is to take a boat he has been preparing for sea as a Calypso and explore the oceans. The two dreams finally merge. But getting there takes 50 first dates, so to speak, and fifty first kisses.

Dad and brother (Sean Astin) help Drew to forget the car accident by restaging the last day before the accident day after day after.... Before she meets Henry, she relives the same day over and over. Henry becomes a catalyst for change. When she leaves to live in a rehabilitation center, she paints Henry over and over without knowing who he is or why she paints him.

This movie is not intellectually challenging. It is not one chase scene after the other. There are no villains. ""50 First Dates"" is a fun, sweet, simple movie about love and acceptance, gentleness of spirit, kindness writ large, and did I say love?

Take a look at the expression on the face of Ms Barrymore in the picture on the DVD cover; that's exactly how I look when I find myself watching another Adam Sandler film. Unfortunately, my teenage son and my two twenty-something nieces all find Sandler rib-splitting funny.

He accidentally meets the girl of his dreams and has a perfect day with her. When he meets her for a date the next day he finds she has no recollection of him and wants nothing to do with him.

He can't help himself - he longs to be with her. So he comes up with ways to make her fall for him every day. He's so hooked, but how can this relationship possibly work? As this is all worked out, this story has laugh out loud moments mixed with intense drama. Adam Sandler is hilarious, and Drew Barrymore has her hilarious moments as well, but there are also some very serious and moving moments. Personally I feel the depth of the script combined with the humor is what makes this such a quality film.

This movie has it all. An unusual premise that I've never seen done before, a great script, fantastic actors, plenty of fun and plenty of drama and heart. It's great to see Adam and Drew together again - they have the same fantastic chemistry that they had in The Wedding Singer. Rob Schneider is also really funny as Adam Sandler's best friend.

Then, by accident, I happened to catch the film on t.v. - on a channel that interrupted it with very few commercials. Not only was it charming and realistic, it was funny in a way modern films seldom are - the characters themselves were interestingly written and well-played (I was also stunned by Rob Schneider - and the cameo by Dan Ayckroyd - sp.? - was lovely and well-researched). And it had a quirky and very current topic: traumatic brain injury, which was treated humorously and sensitively but not made into a caricature or a joke.  There was no guarantee the story could possibly end happily. I had already decided to order the DVD for a friend's birthday (someone who also turned up her nose at the mention of Adam Sandler) and ordered a copy for myself; then I read a review (no, I can't recall who was interviewed.) The interviewer asked this film scholar, ""Why aren't there any good romantic films - on the order of 'It Happened One Night' or some of the Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn or K. Hepburn/Spencer Tracy classics?"" And the interviewee said, well, there aren't many, but there are a few - and ""50 First Dates"" was one of them! B.

5469017,4,B00AQ5U234,"Far too many have written off Adam Sandler as a one note performer whose draw as a feature film star is more based on luck than talent. The funny thing is that with all of his detractors, he continues to put out solid films that do well at the box office and more importantly, with his fans. While many of his films have depicted a bungler who runs into good fortune, perhaps his biggest hit involved an attempt to revive the romantic comedy in THE WEDDING SINGER. Now Sandler reunites with his co-star of that film, Drew Barrymore, and shows that the genre is still a valid one.

Sandler plays Henry Roth, a vet at an aquarium in Hawaii. He plays life fast and loose, finding a new woman nearly every day and presenting himself as something he is not. Yes, Henry is a player who loves a one night stand. Until fortune sets him on course with the love of his life, Lucy (Barrymore).

Meeting by chance at a local restaurant over breakfast, the pair hit it off from the start. The attraction is a strong one, so much so that they make plans to meet the next day for breakfast again. But at that meeting, Lucy acts as if she has no idea who Henry is. A quick chat with the owner and Henry finds out that Lucy is suffering from a rare brain disorder.

It seems that she was in an accident a year earlier and the damaged tissue in her brain is that responsible for short term memory. She retains all of her memories prior to the crash but nothing after it. Each day begins as that morning she set out with her father. Her father (Blake Clarke) and brother (Sean Astin) have been perpetuating the myth by passing off the duplicates of that day's newspaper while the family friends at the restaurant keep her thinking it is that day as well.

Her family tries to chase Henry off, but he is so smitten that he continues to find ways to see Lucy. Then one day her father calls him over to talk to him. Noticing that she only sings the song that was he and his late wife's song on the days she meets with Henry, they think that perhaps she is making some progress. And so he begins to encourage the couple seeing each other.

Then Henry gets an idea. He makes a video for Lucy to watch each morning, showing her what is going on and letting her know what is happening. Each morning becomes a first date for the couple, each kiss a first kiss.

When Lucy discovers that Henry has canceled a trip to do research in Alaska to stay and be there for her, she makes a decision. She asks Henry to help her erase all of her memories of him from her journal so that she will forget Henry. In doing so, he would be free to fulfill his plans. Can these two find a way to make the relationship work?

This film works on all levels. It is a funny comedy showing the different ways that Henry tries to approach Lucy and win her favor day after day. And it works as a romance because no matter how he does it, he always gets Lucy to fall in love at first sight with him each day. It's a feel good movie that offers a unique twist in the solution it poses by film's end.

Sandler does a great job here, not playing the usual buffoon that he does, but showing a soft romantic side. He is growing as an actor and does a great job. The same can be said of Barrymore who has become a much more gifted actress than I think many would have expected of her.

The movie is a great family film with only a few touches here and there that might yield themselves for further explanation with the kids at a later date. But on the whole, it is funny, touching and moving for the adults.

If you're looking for a good time while watching a movie, then this is the one to pick. It delivers on all accounts and will leave you with a smile on your face and in your heart.",1205366400,3,3729,4.166666666666667

A friend then informs Henry that Lucy has no short-term memory due to a car accident.  Every day she does the same thing, believing that it is still the day of the accident.  Her family goes to great lengths to make her sure she still believes that, so she doesn't freak out every day as she realizes the sad nature of her condition.

But now Henry is involved.  He can't get enough of this girl and is quickly falling in love with her, so he helps her move forward with her life.  Every day he is presented with the challenge of making her fall in love with him.  The idea behind the story is so unique and is pulled off very convincingly, with lots of fun and funny moments.  Henry and Lucy make a cute couple and the acting is wonderful.  The ending was perfect - very sweet.  The only issue I had with the movie was the unnecessary profanity and occassional crudeness.

Whatever it was, it kept me from enjoying the movie. I did not really find it sweet or cute or funny in any way. It was just odd. I know that people do experience such an awful form of memory loss, but to me, that makes a good dramatic film. Not a romantic comedy. I mean, I can understand why people would wish to make light of the situation and make it romantic and whatnot, but for me, it didn't work.

5469022,3,B00AQ5U234,"Movie and DVD transfer rate a 3.

I am not a fan of most movies produced since 1990.  Movie ""executive"" empty suits call for fire and smoke, and writers whose talents are under-utilized timidly comply.  A woman's acting abilities are generally contained in her bra cups.

This movie is a pleasant surprise.  I was forced to watch it to be polite to my hosts, then went out to buy it.  I thought the movie was worth a second look.

Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are a believable couple.  Neither over-acts; they are comfortable in their own skins and with each other.  They portray very sympathetic characters, and you genuinely care about their plight.

Casting of other characters is generally OK, with exception of Dan Akroyd.  He is deadpan and lifeless.  I kept waiting for a pratfall or punchlines during his boring presentations.  There were none, and the end result is not satisfying.

There are assinine attempts at gay humor and bathroom humor with a walrus.  The audience that would find these moments funny wouldn't be watching a romantic comedy, so why do it?  The empty suits thought this would be funny?

Whether this movie has a happy ending is immaterial.  Sandler and Barrymore have done their jobs admirably.

The final scene has Brother Iz, a Hawaiian legend, singing ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"".  It is a fitting end to a satisfying romantic comedy.",1196467200,3,1372,4.831896551724138
5469023,4,B00AQ5U234,"I had real reservations about this movie at first. It seemed not only an overly-silly movie - but one with a questionable plot line. A guy is dating a girl with brain damage, and then has fun taking advantage of her?

Still, I love Hawaii and thought I would give it a try. Slowly but surely the tale sucked me in. Adam Sandler plays a playboy aquarium worker. Each week he takes on another visiting woman, wines and dines her, then sends her on her way. He likes the short term romances with no memories.

Suddenly into his life falls Drew Barrymore, a local woman with a past. It turns out she was in a car accident which damaged her long term memory ability. She wakes up every morning thinking it's a specific day. She remembers clearly her life up until that point - but she can't make any new memories. So she'll enjoy and have fun on her day with Adam, but when she wakes up the next morning, she'll forget all about him and once again think it's the morning of that same day. Unfortunately for her father, that day is his birthday, so he is stuck with birthday cakes every single day.

Her father and brother (played hilariously by Sean Astin - Sam from Lord of the Rings) have tried various techniques over the weeks and found that she does best when they simply play along with her faulty memory. They give her an old newspaper, take her birthday present, watch her favorite movie with her, and so on. They expect to have keep doing this with her, every day, until she either heals or they pass away.

You can see pretty quickly that this wasn't a great long time plan, but you also feel for the dad and brother. They obviously love Drew and want to keep her happy. They resist at first when Adam begins to get into her life, but they realize how much the two care for each other. Adam starts to make ""wake up videos"" for Drew, so that when she first wakes up in the morning she can be gently brought up to date with the life she isn't able to remember.

There are a few ""silly / gross"" jokes in here - almost as if the movie was made for young teens - but then there are also a number of sexual jokes / puns that are probably not appropriate for that age group. I thought in that sense that Wedding Singers was much better done, with an awesome balance of maturity and fun. This movie slides just a little bit into the immature category.

But that is vastly made up for by the gorgeous Oahu scenery. If you're lucky enough to make it to Hawaii, you can see many of the locations used in the movie. Sea Life Park might be a good spot to add to your list! Locals also say that the Ula character is pretty dead-on as far as the laid back, casual attitude that is prevalent here.

I've watched this movie MANY times and it definitely has become one I enjoy greatly. There are many great lines, and the inappropriate jokes are easy to gloss over. Well recommended!",1195257600,,2870,4.274401473296501

Rob Schneider gives his best movie performance ever as Oola, Adam's best friend. And Sean Astin plays Drew's steroid-enhanced wanna-be weight lifter brother that is a COMPLETELY different switch from his dramatic role in The Lord of the Rings. Drew Barrymore gives an fantastic performance as a girl who has brain damage from a car accident and has lost all short term memory to the point that she can only remember her life up to the accident, and her memory after that is erased every night. This obviously causes Adam Sandler problems in his attempt to make her fall in love with him all over again every day. This is a wonderful movie you'll want to watch again and again.

5469026,5,B00AQ5U234,"I know I messed that line up somehow but the sentiment is the same. This romantic comedy is quirky, cute and absolutely sugar sweet. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have onscreen chemistry that rivals Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in this movie about a woman who is forced to live in the past because each day is like a repeat of the day before.

Injured in an auto accident years ago, Barrymore is now being cared for by her father and brother, who take precautions to make sure every day is exactly the same. Why? Because for Drew Barrymore is IS exactly the same. Every night she goes to sleep and every morning she wakes up with no memory of the day that has just passed. She thinks it is the morning of her car wreck. (Note: she has no memory of the wreck. She thinks it is apparently the time frame BEFORE the wreck... It is as if the trauma of the wreck is simply too much for her mind to grasp. )

When Adam Sandler steps into the picture, things begin to change. Subtle differences occur, much in the same way difference occur for Bill Murray, a la Groundhog's Day. Ultimately what transpires is a deepening of affection and a crossroads in life.

Adam Sandler must choose. Can he truly live with a woman who can't remember him? If she can't remember him, how can she truly love him? Some how it all works out and the conclusion is both funny and tear-jerking.

This is not a bad date movie if I do say so myself.",1183680000,3,1415,4.268656716417911
5469027,4,B00AQ5U234,"In the long line of men who act like children Adam Sandler is probably the most successful.  Here, with `50 First Dates' he gives us a good reason as to why.  Coupled with the talented Drew Barrymore he wonderfully crafts a funny yet sincere romantic comedy that whops a wallop of a tear jerking ending.  The chemistry between the two stars is impeccable and believable despite the beauty factor of Barrymore and the goofy factor of Sandler.  They work wonderfully together and Barrymore has proven to get the best out of Sandler for the second time.  Arguably their first pairing in `The Wedding Singer' is a better movie, but that's arguable since this little gem is just as funny and just as sweet.

The story is one that could have gone either way in the genre department.  Barrymore's character Lucy is a beautiful Hawaiian native who attracts the attention of playboy Henry Roth, a native who entertains tourist women with good times and one night stands and loves the bachelorhood he's built for himself.  Lucy is different though, she's otherworldly to Roth in a way, so much different than the girls he's used to being with.  Lucy's main difference though is not anything Henry would have expected.  Lucy has no short term memory.  In fact she lives everyday as if it were the same day, going to sleep and waking up on her fathers birthday, the day she suffered a horrendous accident that caused her to lose her ability to remember anything after that point.  This same plotline could have made a brilliant drama, but I'm glad they went funny with this one.

After Roth finds out Lucy's problem he makes a special effort each day to make her fall in love with him again, not for the sheer satisfaction of the chase but because there's something about Lucy that he can't let go of.  He loves this girl.  At first her father and brother are indifferent to the idea, opposed even, but when they see the positive effect that Henry is having on Lucy they decide that maybe this isn't such a bad idea.

Adam Sandler, while still giving the audience the slapstick and comedy they are used to, delivers a more mature performance than most of his other comedic films.  His relationship with Barrymore's character is much more sympathetic then in previous films and is one the audience can get behind and cheer for.  Barrymore though upstages Sandler every step of the way delivering an on point comedic performance that will make any fan proud.  She's beautiful, sweet, sincere and hilarious.  The supporting actors all do a fine job, Rob Schneider delivering most of the big laughs as Ula the pot smoking father of a small tribe of children.  Blake Clark and Sean Astin are good as Lucy's father and brother and Pomaika'i Brown is hilarious as `tattoo face', the chief at the local restaurant where Lucy and Henry meet.

There are some one-liners in this film that almost take away from the effortless hilarity of the balance of the film.  Dan Aykroyd has resorted to painful roles and this is one of them, a role littered with dialog that's hard to listen to without cringing, and that Hawaiian native who gives the audience language lessons is more than annoying.  Aside from this minor downfall the audience will have a great time watching Henry's pathetic attempts at swooning Lucy, Ula's hilarious attempts at helping him, not to mention his pathetic advice, but I'm sure nothing will give the audience more pleasure than trying to decide just what gender Henry's horny associate really is!",1182729600,2,3496,4.740495867768595
5469028,5,B00AQ5U234,"After ""The Wedding Singer"" the Sandler-Barrymore duo do it again with their wonderful on-screen chemistry and an adorable story. The movie also makes you think philosophically. Actually many people in life whose actions are still very mechanical and robot like, live a life as Drew does in this movie. However unlike Drew there are none to tell these people what's wrong with their lives. However it is also tragic to think that one day she has to wake up somewhere in her 60's and realise that her father died and then relive that everyday. The same feeling would multiply if more of her loved ones were to die before her. The other thing to imagine is that someone ought to ensure her daily treatment continued till she died.

Then there are those unforgettable numbers from the 80's, particularly ""Lovesong"" and ""Friday I'am in love"" by the amazing, The Cure, ""Drive"" by The Cars, ""Hold me now"" from the Thomson Twins, The Police's ""Every breath You take"" and Spandau Ballet's ""True"" which was also featured in ""The Wedding Singer"". Most of these numbers this time are played as cover songs by newer artistes making the soundtrack to this movie another big seller.  ""Could you be loved"" the original by Bob Marley is retained though. And like ""The Wedding Singer"" there's that adorable song from Adam Sandler as well.

Hawaii is pictured so beautifully that the movie literally promotes tourism for this lovely island.

Several other characters also deserve praise. Henry's Hawaiian Friend, Lucy's brother (played by the guy who plays Frodo's friend in ""Lord of the Ring"",series), the Chef at the restaurant, the owner of the restaurant, the Drew's father and Henry's assistant at the zoo.

The idea of continually reliving and reviewing one's life in a day seems to me to be a new twist on a theme in the previous two films on time travel through changing states of mind.  The amazon product reviewer for _50 First Dates_ this time notes that the film had lots of opportunities to do something more with the main plot theme.  Still, the film did stick in my mind because Gene Wolfe, one of my favorite science fiction writers, wrote a novel, _Latro in the Mist_ some decades ago about a literate Roman mercenary soldier in ancient Greece who also suffered brain damage so that short term daily experiences did not convert into long term memory.  He too, like Lucy, keeps a diary/journal of the day's events which he reads the next morning.  Wolfe's later fiction works develop through the storytelling and journal writing of his main characters, who love something: a woman, a cause, the truth, and so on.  The reader's dramatic experience explicitly evolves with the developing testament of the main character.  Consequently, Lucy's use of writing and film-making might seem like commentary on the role of art for the individual to transcend the limitations of memory and time.",1153094400,3,1283,4.804545454545455

Don't get me wrong -- the movie is a little schizophrenic. It most certainly does have its sophomoric slapstick moments (and in my opinion, would have been a better movie if they'd gotten rid of them). But within the silliness is a sweet message about love and finding the person you are meant to be with. The chemistry between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore is really outstanding.

Well that's the life sentence that has been dished out to pretty Hawaiian school teacher Lucy Whitmore and no matter what the efforts of her loving father and brother; every day starts the same for poor Lucy.

Henry Roth is the local veterinarian at the sea-life centre, a of dubious intentions to visiting tourist, but who falls head over heels in love with Lucy and even after realising her condition, makes it his life work to try to make some sort of relationship together.

That's the plot setting of ""50 First Dates"" which sees the romantic comedy pairing of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore once again grace the big screen with their lovely brand of sweet sentimental romance. With any romantic comedy at the end of the day it's got the be the relationship the two leads can strike up that will make or break the film, and theirs is perhaps none better than these two, who play off each other wonderfully well and draw the viewer into their cosy smiley filled world.

There's some great support too, most notably from Rob Schneider as Ula, the Hawaiian shark friend, although the sharks don't seem to repay the friendship. Sean Astin also chips in with a great turn as the bodybuilding brother of Lucy. There's also some other tiny parts that still raise more than a couple of laughs, the Chinese guy at the restaurant and Henry's sea-world colleague, Alexa to mention but two. Quick mention also for Dan Aykroyd who pops up as Dr Keats.

There's really not a lot more to say other than any fans of the genre should check the film out and I'll challenge even the most severe of critics not to find something to enjoy in this.

One final word for the ending which had the integrity and the honesty not to ""cop out"" and yet still wrap things up and let you leave the cinema or switch off the DVD player and let out a big ""Ahhhh""",1151107200,4,2126,4.4974093264248705

5469056,5,B00AQ5U234,"I know there are a million reviews on this movie, but I just had to add my opinion to the throng. Why? Because this movie is perfect. I am maddeningly picky about movies, and I usually only expect to chuckle through an Adam Sandler movie, but this one...wow.

Adam Sandler plays a womanizing marine biologist in the beautiful setting of Hawaii. He meets Drew Barrymore's character, a witty, funny, and charming woman who just happens to have a slight memory problem- in that she relives the same day over and over again thanks to a car accident. Both these characters could have been simple fluff, with no depth or anything that would cause the audience to connect, but for some reason, throughout the entire movie, you are willing them to overcome their incredible circumstances. Sandler undertakes the mad task of building a long-term relationship with Barrymore's character, starting from scratch every day! His methods are sweet and funny, its no wonder he's so successful at wooing her.

The supporting cast is great and not overbearing or interruptive to the story- though the man-woman-person is not my favorite...just disturbing. Sean Astin was great, managed to be a caring, sweet character even with that annoying lisp.

Bottom line, this is a movie to watch with your boyfriend/husband- it's got enough comedy (both low-brow and intelligent) to entertain everyone, plus...this is a sweet, sweet story that will break your heart a few times, right up to the ending, which had me in tears, sobbing. If you don't have the same gut-twisting reaction, then you better have somebody take your pulse. However, if this movie lacked humor in your opinion, watch The Wedding Singer. If you want more drama/reality with a dash of intellectual humor, try Spanglish. Adam Sandler is awesome!",1149552000,5,1789,5.016835016835016

Also, it's good for both sexes.",1149120000,2,324,4.5
5469058,3,B00AQ5U234,"Adam Sandler's movies are oh so goofy.  His idea of humor can be annoyhing at times.  However, intermixed between all the childish behavior is that true love is oh so beautiful.  And Sandler does show his vulnerable side.

Fortunately this movie is relatively short because it is not long on depth.  Nonetheless, the characters are all kind of amusing.  If you are in the mood for something not overly ellaborate and light-hearted, this flick will fit the bill.",1145836800,2,461,4.846153846153846

Henry sees Lucy as a challenge being it she has lost her memory and he makes it his everyday job to make her fall for him. Sooner or later he's bound to fall for her too. The real challenge is for him to come up with new methods to make her remember.

Homosexuality is not funny. she found out that every day is not Sunday the 13th when a cop gave her a ticket. about the soundtrack. it really sounded stupid. it was mostly Bob Marley and No Doubt. as I have said before, No Doubt SUCKS! if Adam Sandler is listening to that crap, he is going to have a hard time getting laid.",1141776000,,628,4.07258064516129

It's a cute story of how Sandler tries to win the love of Lucy (Barrymore) over and over again because after an accident, she is unable to make new memories. Since this is an Adam Sandler movie, it's not entirely mushy but still has a few sappy moments. That doesn't make it any less funny though. Rob Schneider plays Sandler's native Hawaiian pot-smoking friend and you can expect to laugh a lot at him. Lucy's family is also hilarious and so are the owners of the restaurant they meet at. Oh, not to mention Sandler's he-she assistant at the zoo...good stuff! Sandler & Barrymore also have a great chemistry like they had in The Wedding Singer. They work very well together in my opinion.

Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, Hawaii's Casinova, who goes after women for a one night stand- but that all changes when Henry spots Lucy, a local, in a restaurant. The two of them hit it off magnificently and they make a date to meet for breakfast the next morning in the same place. When Henry approaches Lucy the next day, she doesn't remember who he is at all. Turns out that she was in an accident and has short term memory loss.

The movie was truly great. One of my all time favorites. Adam Sandler is a good actor and Drew Barrymore was terrific. The movie has the most beautifully sweet ending ever (By the way, I suggest watching it at midnight when you feel emotional- makes it even better). A definate must-see.",1139616000,2,785,4.451388888888889
5469065,4,B00AQ5U234,"First off, I am NOT a huge fan of romantic comedies. In fact, I find most romantic comedies just ""OKAY"" with a sprinkle of romance and a few laughs here and there. That said, I was expecting much of the same old same old here, but I was honestly surprised to find myself really enjoying it.

Henry Roth is a marine biologist in Hawaii. He never commits with any girl, and usually beds tourists because he doesn't have to form an attachment to them and vice versa. One day however, out of coincidence he meets this beautiful girl, Lucy and of course it's love at first sight. They hit it off but unfortunately, she has short-term memory loss and doesn't remember him the next day. The story between Henry and Lucy ensues with an array of colorful characters like Lucy's family as well as Henry's friend, Ula and his kids (Ula's, not Henry's).

I've realized that Adam Sandler's humor is either a love or hate thing for most people. They either adore his jokes and catch every movie he's in or they find it disgusting and skip every movie he's in. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of his dumbed down humor, I prefer humor that is a little intelligent, sarcastic and witty. That's why I love movies like The Wedding Crashers. But I have to say, Adam Sandler really outdoes himself in this movie. The whole premise was intriguing. After the guy tries his best to woo the girl, and when things seem to go well...she forgets him the very next day. Instead of ""understanding"" her problem and trying to fix it, he rolls with it...and I guess that was what made this movie different. So Henry tries to make her fall for him every single day, and later adopts various methods to make the situation better. These parts of the movie were really sweet. Although many things Henry did ended up looking goofy, the movie captures certain moments when everything falls to place and you go ""awwwwww"". It helps that they filmed the movie in Hawaii, where everything seems so tranquil and beautiful. Plus, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore made a really cute couple. Barrymore especially has an innocence to her that makes it all seem so much more genuine. And to provide the really funny parts, they got Rob Schneider as Ula. I was laughing my ass off every time he came on screen. Lucy's family was a hoot to watch as well.

In short, this movie defines the term ""feel good"". I had a great time watching it. The chemistry on screen between the actors was superb. The storyline was unique, a lot less typical than the 101 other romantic comedies out there. The jokes cracked me up. All in all, a very good movie. Watch it with your family, your loved one or even alone, especially when you're feeling down...it'll lift your spirits. I watched this movie on HBO and have since bought the DVD.

5469066,5,B00AQ5U234,"Love stories that end happily are my favorite kind of movies.  But I never thought I'd be saying that about an Adam Sandler movie!  This movie was pure entertainment. I laughed hysterically during some parts and cried silently during the emotional scenes - they were tears of joy and I enjoyed every minute of it.

This movie is not The Water Boy - thank goodness.  It's great to see Sandler stop doing movies mainly targeted to the adolescent male.  I got a glimpse of his maturity in Spanglish and also in 50 First Dates.  Maybe that's why I loved both movies whereas his earlier movies were not for me.  I don't mind a little juvenile humor & goofiness - we're talking about Adam Sandler here after all.  But I was surprised to find this movie so warm and endearing.

The only teeny-tiny weakness in the movie was Rob Schneider.  He over-played his role as usual.  Every time he came on-screen, he might as well have looked at the camera and winked!  Yup, he's the new Chevy Chase but not as smarmy.  Someone should have explained to them both that there's a difference between a SNL skit and getting seriously into a role.  This wonderful, funny and heart-warming movie deserved better.

It could have been better without the crude humor but the relationship between Adam Sandler's character and Drew Barrymore's charactor is reason enough to watch this movie.

5469071,3,B00AQ5U234,"Every movie has it's great moments and it's embarrassments.  Sometimes these embarrassments bring down what promises to be an enjoyable piece of entertainment.  The embarrassment in this movie is Adam Sandler himself.

If you like Adam Sandler, if you like his gutter humor, then you might actually like this movie.  I, on the other hand, found Sandler grossly miscast as leading man Henry Roth.  I found the first 15 minutes of the movie very painful to watch because of the walrus vomit, the pointless androgynous character, and the lowbrow sexual comments.  To me it felt like Adam Sandler said, ""Hey, my fans won't like this movie if I don't put some of this stuff in because that's what they like.""  I must say I almost turned it off and threw it away because of the humor (I received it as a Secret Santa gift).

But I stayed with it, and I'm glad I did.  Drew Barrymore is the saving angel of this film.  She plays Lucy Whitmore, a young woman who was in a car crash about a year earlier and, as a result of head injuries, can no longer turn short-term memories into long-term memories.  She is a blank slate every morning, and Sandler's character has to get her to fall in love with him every single day.  Barrymore shows a true acting ability by carefully walking a tightrope from making Lucy either too pathetic or too comic.  She brings warmth and sensitivity to the role and certainly makes up for what Sandler doesn't have.  She is also drop-dead gorgeous, and that doesn't hurt at all.

That isn't to say Sandler doesn't have some good moments so long as it fits the movie.  One scene I laughed at was his second meeting with Lucy.  He's unaware of her memory problem and says he spent the whole night thinking about her while he stroked his walrus.  The double entendre (and Drew Barrymore's classic reaction) was well done AND appropriate to the movie.

Here's my problem.  Sandler can't act.  He is as wooden as William Shatner and just about as funny as well.  I liked the fact that he isn't a good looking guy and even pokes fun at himself by telling Lucy that he's sorry he's not better looking.  It just proves that even us average Joes can fall in love and get the girl.  Too often he falls into his SNL schtick (which I never liked) and threatens to pull the entire movie down with it.

A minor problem I have is Rob Schneider.  How could they cast him as Sandler's Hawaiian best friend, Hula?  Was there no truly Hawaiian actor who could have played the part?  This reminds me of a time 15 years with the musical Miss Saigon when the acting union protested the casting of a Caucasian as a Eurasian.

The last half hour of the film is the best (though Sandler does, sadly, do his gutter schtick on occasion -- somebody should tell him that raising his voice is not acting).  The ending, which I won't reveal, is the best I've seen in ages and is not the typical ending Hollywood would have used.

Once again, Sandler stinks.  It's Drew Barrymore who lifts this movie from the dung heap.  That's why I can only give it 3 out of 5 stars.",1134950400,7,3058,4.442446043165468

5469076,4,B00AQ5U234,"The 2004 film ""50 First Dates"" that was directed by Peter Segal (who directed ""Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult"" in 1994) was an unexpected pleasant surprise as I typically don't like films starring Adam Sandler or Rob Schneider.  However, Sandler's role as Henry Roth, who falls in love with the artist Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), is well-acted in showing both the character's frustration and determination in dealing with Lucy's short-term memory loss that prevents her from remembering just about everything from one day to the next.  Taking place in Hawaii, Henry works at a sea aquarium as its veterinarian with walruses, penguins and dolphins, as well as one of the animal trainers named Ula (Rob Schneider). For many years, Lucy has been taken care of by her aging father, Marlin Whitmore (Blake Clark) and her stuttering bodybuilding brother named Doug (Sean Astin).  Henry is smitten with Lucy from the first time that they meet, but unfortunately, their relationship becomes difficult, as Henry must start over afresh each day because Lucy can't remember whom he is.  Though they spend many wonderful days together and find a way to help Lucy remember what has transpired between them, she comes to the conclusion one day that she is holding Henry back from his dreams.  He goes off to finish working on his sailboat and plans to leave the island (and her), but when he visits her one last time, he finds that she has been remembering him in her dreams and in her paintings. Will they find a way to build a lasting relationship or go their separate ways?  You'll just have to watch this highly recommended film to find out!

Overall, I rate ""50 First Dates"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It's an inspiring and touching light romantic comedy with a wonderful soundtrack that features such songs as ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" (by the Beach Boys), ""Another Day"" (by Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney, 1941-1998), ""Could You Be Loved"" (by Bob Marley, 1945-1981), and ""Is This Love"" (also by Bob Marley) to name a few.  Other memorable characters in the film include Alexa (Lusia Strus), Dr. Keats (Dan Aykroyd), Stacy (Maya Rudolph) and Nick (Pomaika'i Brown).  Of course, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Dan Aydroyd and Maya Rudolph are all veterans of the long-running TV comedy variety show ""Saturday Night Live"", which has been on the air continually since 1975.",1131408000,7,2363,4.885
5469077,5,B00AQ5U234,"Amazing. I was already excited to know that Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore were teaming up again (two of my favorites), and it couldn't have been more perfect. Sandler's character is known in the movie as a bachelor, however you know he is sensative and has a heart-- he is a veternarian and more ""cautious"" around his friend's children-- so the fact that he can fall in love with Barrymore's character under the circumstances is totally believable. The best romantic comedy I believe I've ever seen. I laughed so hard I cried. ""Ten Second Tom"" ( a patient who can't remember anything for more than 10 seconds) is one of my favorite characters. I could have done without some of the crudeness of Schneider's character, but I think that just took away from the character and not the movie at all. This will touch your heart in a way you wouldn't have thought. And if you believe in ""fairy tales,"" it's all over! I bawled so hard at the end!

5469078,1,B00AQ5U234,"I like to hurt myself. I wasn't fully aware of this fact until I recently completed watching ""50 First Dates"" staring the diverse satirical genius that is Adam Sandler. That's right, I watched all 90 minutes of it. Like having a sore in your mouth that you just can't resist continually poking with your tongue  I kept watching. What's more is that I knew what was coming before I even hit play, it's Adam Sandler, the modern day Rosie O'Donell for god sakes. It was like drinking a fifth of Gordon's Vodka, I knew it would be ill but I guess I just wanted to remind myself what ill was like.

Once again we are treated to the silver screen magic of Rob Schneider and Sandler. And once again Rob Schneider proves he is an actor's actor; the way he is able to continually reinvent himself is truly magnificent. With this film he confirms that he is almost a better sidekick then malaria. This time he plays a Hawaiian local and Sandlers best pal. They both work with animals which are a key comedic element in the film. Sandlers back and forth bantering with sea lions and dolphins is reminiscent of the 80's film ""Beastmaster"" staring Kevin Bacon or at least a guy that looks like Kevin Bacon. Sandler is the ultimate island playboy till he meets Drew Barrymore. They fall in love and all is well. But the next day it starts raining in paradise (both literally in the film as well as figuratively in this review). She doesn't remember him! Turns out that she forgets what happens each day due to an auto accident with her father 7 months ago. She has no short term memory so she is mentally stuck on the day of the accident which happens to be her father's birthday. So each day her dad and brother pretend like it's his birthday. They have stacks of news papers from that day, they watch video taped TV with her that they have seen hundreds of time etc etc so she has no idea what happened and doesn't get sad. I know it's a movie but it is so dam ridiculous I questioned my free will as I sat at my desk and continued to watch the film. Even when Sandler gets  hipped to this crazy routine he cant help but make her fall in love with him each day while simultaneously vomiting his trademark hilarity all over the screen.

The best way I can end this review is to write a short list of movies that are better then this one.

1)  Waterworld

2)  Anchorman (but just barely)

3)  Blackula (the black vampire movie)

4)  Slackers

5)  Iron Eagle 2

8)  Teen Wolf Too

5469081,5,B00AQ5U234,"""50 First Dates"" is an Adam Sandler movie of surprising depth and heart.  As an avid movie-watcher and someone who's traditionally not a fan of Sandler, no one is more surprised than me.  This film is NOT typical Saturday-Night Live fare, despite the unfortunate guest appearance of a shark-bitten (and unfunny) Rob Schneider.

In perhaps his most likeable character to date, Sandler breaks from his traditional stereotypes of playing the misunderstood social misfit with an anger management problem.  This time he plays Henry Roth, who although retains some classic ""Sandlerisms"", is a surprisingly normal, sweet-natured, down-to-earth guy who happens to be in love with a girl with no short-term memory.  Adorable Drew Barrrymore's limitless cuteness and feminine charm makes his dilemma believable; were I in Sandler's shoes, I'd be in love with her too.

In one of her best performances to date, Barrymore (playing Lucy Whitmore) hits a perfect balance between comedy and sombreness for her character's tragedy.  The movie works because that tragedy is not overlooked; the characters reflect and deal with it, they try to work around it.  The movie works because Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry is real and palpable.  But perhaps most of all, and most amazing to me, is that despite losing her memory everyday, Lucy's character develops as the film progresses.  Barrymore's performance keeps getting better and better as the film goes on, giving great depth to what potentially could have been nothing more than a comedic gimmick.

The ending of the film is especially well done for a film of this type.  At once poignant, wildly romantic, and beautiful, cry I nearly did!  The movie's heart lies in the sacrifices the characters make, the believable love they share, and their will to make things work without a magical ""deus ex machina"" that fixes everything and saves the day.  From that perspective, the film is quite bold, choosing to rely on the strength of its storytelling and acting to hold itself up.  The film had its humorous moments, but those will not be what I remember years from now.  Kudos, Mr. Sandler.  I hope to see more films like this from you, but somehow I doubt it.  The lure of making more films based on 3rd grade potty-jokes instead of emotion and depth is strong.  Well, at least I get to enjoy this little gem.",1128038400,2,2347,4.971794871794872

5469086,5,B00AQ5U234,"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore star in this wonderfully funny film about true love overcoming any obstacle.

Sandler stars as Harry Roth, a veterinarian at a Hawaiian zoo who meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) while having breakfast one morning.  Harry is immediately attracted to Lucy, and they agree to meet again the next day.  However, when Harry arrives back at the restaurant, Lucy has no memory of the previous day, or meeting Harry.

The owner of the restaurant immediately calls Lucy's father, and he explains to Harry that Lucy is suffering from a brain disorder  suffered in a car accident.  Her short-term memory lasts for only 24 hours, after which she forgets everything that happened the previous day.  Harry is forced to introduce himself to Lucy every morning, and the entire process repeats itself.  However, he has devised some ways to try to jar Lucy's suppressed memories by making a video of the events that have happened since her accident.

Little by little, Lucy seems to be remembering other things.  She has also begun to keep a journal of each day she spends with Harry so she will remember later.  They are also falling in love with each other.  However, Lucy approaches Harry one day and tells him she wants to break off their relationship because she doesn't think its fair for him to have to go through the same routine every day.  She then checks herself into a hospital for patients with brain disorders.  Meanwhile, Harry has decided to leave on his trip that he's been planning to study marine wildlife.  Will Lucy remember her accident and what has happened since?  Will Harry be able to convince Lucy he loves her despite her problems?

This is an excellent movie.  Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are terrific together, and their chemistry is first-rate.  The comedy is very funny, and the supporting actors, especially the wise-cracking old Hawaiian man in the restaurant, do a very good job.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The acting is great, and the story is very funny, but it does have a serious side as well.  The aspect of Lucy's disorder is handled in a funny, yet compassionate way throughout the film.  This is a great movie for couples to watch.  Its not just a ""chick flick""; I enjoyed it just as much as my wife did.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  You and your significant other will surely enjoy it.",1122249600,6,2379,4.769607843137255

But then he finds out that she has short term memory loss after a car wreck. So she can remember everything up to the accident. And, so everyday is her birthday, because that's the last day she remembers. So she wakes up like it's still her birthday and so forth. So her dad and brother are really getting frustrated with watching the sixth sense everyday, because that was their present to her. But what makes no sense to me is if they were frustrated of watching that movie, why didn't they just get her a new present? She wouldn't have remembered it.

Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore do terrific jobs as the leads, and the supporting cast is excellent too.  The only problem with the movie, and it's a big one, is Adam Sandler's motivation for continuing to pursue Ms Barrymore after discovering her ailment, and the underlying sickly feeling that he is continuously taking advantage of a brain-damaged woman.

Sandler brings another great character to the screen, especially since this story provokes just as many tears as guffaws. This is possibly Sandler's best film and boasts great comedic turns from Rob Scheider and Sean Astin. This film really does work on all levels, and considering I'm not a fan of the genre. Combining an impressive supporting cast with a sprightly running time and hip soundtrack, and you have one of the best comedies of recent years.

5469091,4,B00AQ5U234,"About six years ago, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore made a charming romantic comedy 'The Wedding Singer.'  '50 First Dates' brings back the two stars in this equally likeable, warmhearted romantic story with a 'Memento'-like twist.  And the location of O'ahu, Hawaii, is very beautiful.

Sandler is a vet named Henry Ross living in Hawaii.  He is also known as playboy whose girlfriends, he insists, must be the travellers from outside the islands, for he doesn't like the whole idea of commitment.  However, he meets a nice girl named Lucy (incredibly charming Drew Barrymore) eating waffle at the local diner, he falls in love with her seriously.  So far, nothing new.

But Lucy has a secret, of which she herself is not aware.  Since the car accident last year, Lucy forgets everything that happened to her after sleeping at night.  That means, though she remembers the things that happened before the accident, including her father, brother, old friends, and that 'today' is her daddy's birthaday, Lucy cannot remember her first kiss with Henry, or the second one, and the third....

The film starts with, and often relies on, the predictable, gross-out gags that are not as great as Peter Segal thinks (and he happens to be responsible the comedies like 'Nutty Professor 2' or 'Naked Gun: 3 1/3').  We get good supports from Rob Schneider, Blake Clark, Sean Astin ('Sam' of 'The Lord of the Rings'), and Dan Aykroyd, but though the film is often funny, the fact cannot be denied that the gags themselves sometimes could be better.

[SWEET, VERY SWEET] But it is the characters that are impressive, and the film shows these likeable people with a heart-felt touch.  In short, we really care these characters, and wish their happiness.  Adam Sandler is known for depicting characters who suddenly get hostile, but in '50 First Dates' he remains calm and natural, which is refreshing to see.  And as to Drew Barrymore, who simply shines through the film, what can I say?

I still believe that Peter Segal is not the right choice for director, and most of the gags should be left in the cutting room.  But the romantic part of the film about the man who literally goes through the '50 First Dates' is surprisingly moving, and I really love the last scene which turns out a little surprise.",1119052800,,2291,4.803571428571429
5469092,5,B00AQ5U234,"Just when I start getting used to the cookie-cutter formula of most romantic comedy movies, a film like 50 First Dates comes along, picks me out of my seat, spins me around, and drops me back down so I don't know which way is up. I walked into the movie theater expecting this movie to be cute and funny at best-and crude and obnoxious at worst. What I found instead was a touching, sweet romantic comedy that occasionally brought tears to my eyes. Best described as Groundhog Day with a twist, this movie tells the story of a love that defies a huge and unusual obstacle.

Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth: ladies' man, man's man, man about town-the love `em and leave `em type. Henry's the sort of guy most women detest-he dates a woman briefly, sleeps with her, and then tells her he's married/gay/about to be deported, etc. He's committed to his work as a veterinarian, and he's terrified of any other kind of commitment. This all changes when he meets Lucy Whitmire in a coffee shop.

Drew Barrymore is Lucy, a sweet, beautiful girl with a severe handicap. She was in a car accident over a year before the story begins, and, as a result, she lost her ability to retain her short-term memory. Each night when she goes to sleep, her brain ""resets"" itself, and she wakes up each day thinking it's October 13 of the previous year-the day the accident took place.

The story gets rolling when Henry not only decides that he cares about Lucy enough to have her meet and fall in love with him each day, but he also manages to convince her overprotective family and friends that he's the real deal.

Sandler and Barrymore prove once again that they have unbelievable chemistry onscreen (they were also wonderful together in 1998's The Wedding Singer). They remind me a little of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, etc.) Although the character of Henry Roth has a softer, gentler persona than many of the characters we've seen Sandler play in the past, fans of the former SNL comedian will appreciate the subtle jokes and references to some of his earlier movies, such as Happy Gilmore. Even the requisite Sandler-composed song, ""Forgetful Lucy,"" is sweet and romantic rather than over-the-top. Drew Barrymore portrays the sweet and confused Lucy to perfection-the audience can completely understand why Henry would go to such great lengths for this girl. Sean Astin and Rob Schneider are hilarious in their supporting roles, and the film has a great soundtrack to back it up.

This movie is definitely a must-see-whether you're on a first date of your own, with a long-term sweetie, or just with the gang. I highly recommend it.",1116979200,10,2650,4.714902807775378
5469093,3,B00AQ5U234,"There seems to be a very wide range of likes and dis-likes of this movie, my advice is to see it for yourself. As for me, it was much better than I expecteded as I usually don't like Adam Sandler movies and I can take or leave Drew Barrymoore (although I really, really liked her in Fever Pitch), anyway in 50 First Dates both of them were excellent. If the movie stayed focused on the main story, the movie would have been excellent. But I finally settled on three stars because I did not care for the distractions in the movie. The whole opening sequence showing Adam Sandles as a love-em-and-leave-em womanizer almost made me shut the movie off, and after seeing the moving and reflecting back on the opening sequence, it just seemed to be so out of character with the role Sandler plays throughout the rest of the movie. It would have been much better to make him a kind of shy, kookie guy who has trouble getting dates, this would have made the rest of the movie (where he has to win over the one girl who, once she gets to know him, really like him) much better. Another very week point in the move is the Ron Schnieder character...at times he was funny, but he almost alway pushed it to the point where it was simply too much. Finally, the parts with the Walrus and other animals at Marineland was great, however even this was ruined with too many references about the animals ""private parts"". Unfortunately, these last two issues prevented me from buying five copies of this movie for various members of my family, who I think would really enjoy the main movie, but would see the ""bathroom humor"" sequences, as inappropriate for children.

If this movie could only go thru the editing process one more time it really could have been something special. Anyway, you have been warned abount the more ""risque"" portion of the movie, but if you can get by that, I believe that you will enjoy this sweet, ligh-hearted, comedy...",1116892800,4,1929,4.527220630372493

(uh, yes but never mind) Lucy's attractiveness hardly makes her a soul mate, but yet Mr. Don Juan Henry Roth (Sandler) is going to pursue her and wed her, even after he finds out that she's  SEVERELY short-term memory-impaired. We're all supposed to buy that idea and find it heart-warming and endearing besides. And I can see by reading other Amazon reviews here that it somehow succeeded! That Adam Sandler's one lucky guy. He can say to his cronies, ""Hey let's head over to Hawaii and act like fools and frat boys and film another lowbrow movie with crude humor and make boatloads of clams.""

Lucy forgets all new memories formed each night and Henry must find new ways to romance her each day.

However, it's Barrymore and Sandler who don't deliver here.  The script is okay and the scenery is beautiful.

But, I was toatlly blown away this is one of those movies where you'll laugh and you'll fall in love. It's not what you expect!

In this movie Barrymore plays Lucy a quirky, funny, girl whose life is turned upside down by a sudden accident that is left her unable to remember what happens each day... even forgetting the guy of her dreams- Sandler. As Sandler's love for Lucy grows he must continue to see her persuing her each day somedays she loves him and other days she ignores him. When Sandler learns that Lucy's father and brother make her relive the same day everyday. Sandler takes action into his own hands deciding to tell her the truth through a video he makes for Lucy adding new bits everyday and Lucy keeps a journal of all their interaction. Barrymore and Sandler make the perfect couple in this feel-good comedy/romance where everytime they kiss it's a first kiss. Lucy finally decides to erase Sandler from her mind completely tearing up journal entires and the good morning Lucy video tapes. By the end of this romantic comedy you'll find yourself asking yourself would you fall in love with the same person everyday?

This movie is all about the extent we will go to for the ones we love.

Adam Sandler is toatlly differant this film than any other and he will charm you in this un-expected, sweet, funny, love story and it's such a refreshing break-away from his roles in ""Big Daddy"", and ""Happy Gillmore."" I found myself falling in love with him. Barrymore also gives a good performance as Lucy who makes pancake houses and goes after attackers. And Sandler is just as charming as hunks such as Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, or Jude Law in a romantic comedy.

5469104,4,B00AQ5U234,"I had pretty much gotten over Adam Sandler, and really didn't see any reason to rush out to the theater to see a new flick he has done. Even tho this film looked promising, I paid it no attention. Not even when it came onto DVD. So, imagine my surprise when I actually caught it on cable the other night and ended up watching it. What a nice little movie. We're not talking Oscar-worthy here folks, but for an Adam Sandler movie, it was quite good. It's easily his best film. But that isn't necessarily saying much, is it?. Re-teaming with Drew Barrymore, his co-star from ""The Wedding Singer"", the two are a sweet and delightful duo. More films with the two of them is most welcome indeed. Sandler stars as Henry Roth, a playboy on a Hawaiian island who seems to have a way with the ladies. A lot of them. His ways change when he meets and falls for the adorable Lucy Whitmore(Barrymore). She is sweet, pretty, interesting, and all around lovely. Henry gets taken for a loop the next day when Lucy swears she has no idea who he is. Apparently, Lucy was in a car accident with her father a year ago, and she suffered major head trauma. The accident resulted in Lucy losing her short term memory. She remembers her whole life up until the accident, but anything afterwards she soon forgets the next day. As her father says, when she goes to sleep at night, her memory gets a clean sweep of the day before. Now Henry is challenged to re-introduce himself to Lucy every day and try to make her fall in love with him over and over again. It's actually a pretty clever little concept for this sweet natured comedy. The levels that her father(comedian Blake Clark), and brother Doug(Sean Astin) go too to make her think nothing has changed, is heartwarming. How everyone loves this young woman so much and tries to make everything right for her. What was surprising was that this is no ordinary Sandler/goofball comedy. It has a lot of heart, romance, and a genuine feeling for the two main characters. It is far and away better than ""The Wedding Singer"", which up to this point, was Sandler's best movie. The cast all does very well too. Astin as brother Doug, is a pumped up steroid jock with a serious speech impediment. Clarke as Mr. Whitmore has that right stern/loving/fatherly performance to him. Dan Aykroyd also has a small cameo as Lucy's doctor. You can't forget Rob Schneider. He always seems to appear in Adam's movies, and Adam always seems to appear in a small cameo in his. However lowbrow Schneider's 'comedy' may be, you can usually count on him for a few good chuckles. This one is no exception. Which leaves us with our two leads. Sandler and Barrymore have, without question, good chemistry with each other. They get along, and light up the screen. Barrymore imbues Lucy with the kind of heart, sweetness, and loveliness that doesn't make anyone question why Hnery would fall in love with you. You'd fall in love with her too!. Sandler has proven here lately that given the right role, like in ""Punch Drunk Love"" and even ""Spanglish"", that he can be a much better actor than people think. This may not be an award type performance here folks, but it's his best job in one of his zany comedies. An eclectic mix of supporting players round out the cast. The funniest being Sandler's co worker, who no one knows if they are a she or a he. Usually a joke like that gets ran into the ground, but it doesn't here. In the end, I was surprised to have seen a goofy, sweet, funny, and heart felt little comedy that is different, but yet the same, than other Sandler movies. If that makes any kind of sense.

Along the way Sandler's brand of comedy is hysterical, sometimes brutally true, but you will still laugh and fall on the floor. This movie is no exception, brilliantly poignant and funny. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler were great in ""The Wedding Singer"", but they are far better in this wonderful story of a young lady losing her short term memory.

But the bunch of hilarious films I have seen with this actor, of which ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Mr. Deeds"" are among the best, convinced me that I had to give ""50 First Dates"" a chance. I am glad I did, because I found an extremely funny comedy with an interesting plot and scenes that stir the viewer's emotions without becoming touchy-feely. The movie uses a similar idea to ""Groundhog Day"", but one that is based on different reasons as catalysts of the situation. In the Bill Murray movie, the main character wakes up to the same day over and over. In the film object of this review, Lucy (Drew Barrymore) has no short term memory, so even though it is a different day for everyone else, she is effectively living repeatedly through the same day without being aware of it.

Lucy's family and friends try to help her in the process by recreating the day in which she had the accident and lost her short term memory (without the accident of course). But one day she meets Henry Roth (Adam Sandler), who is a guy that is used to running away from commitment by inventing all kinds of ridiculous excuses. The fact that he lives in Hawaii and interacts with a lot of women that are in the look for fun helps him in his cause. But meeting Lucy changes his life, because now he cannot get her out of his head and he is the one looking for something more than just a night of passion. The problem is that Lucy forgets everything about him every day when she goes to sleep and he has the arduous task of making her fall in love with him over and over again.

Besides Sandler and Barrymore there are a couple of supporting actors that contribute their fair share to making this movie enjoyable and funny. Rob Schneider delivers a praiseworthy performance in his role of Ula, Henry's best friend. He is the guy in charge of helping Henry in creating new schemes so that he can meet Lucy every day and start the process of making her fall for him. Sean Astin, who most people surely remember from the movie ""Rudy"", appears as Lucy's brother, who is trying to build up some muscle to pretend to be tougher than he really is.

In conclusion, this is a well balanced movie, since it presents moments in which you will laugh your heart out together with others that will arise a myriad of emotions in the audience. The unbelievable scenery adds a definite flair to the overall experience. Those of you that are looking for a comedy that delivers more than cheap laughs, should seriously considering picking this one up.",1107820800,,2659,4.50103519668737
5469107,3,B00AQ5U234,"Yes I know, I have given this film three stars, so if you are at all shocked about this dilemma, go ahead and give me a ""no"" vote. But better yet, read this review and then decide.

The general reviews of the film are about right, though i have some qualms with them. I think Jon-Mark was spot-on when he wrote, ""The movie has the same humour as Adam's previuos movies but it just as funny none the less"". Do not think this movie is some huge turnaround for Sandler, as some critics believed ""Punch Drunk Love"" to be. It still carries the same old Sandler humour, but like alot of his recent films, Sandler shows a little more of that charming side that he always had inside him, only is was very subtle and hidden in his ""Billy Madison"" ""Happy Gilmore"" type performances. Here that side gets a bit more of a showing, though it's interspersed with the usual crude gross-out jokes just to let you know that you are watching a Sandler film and didn't rent out the wrong movie. Sure, it's maybe more romantic and ""touching"" than some of his other films, but there's all the usual wierdo, disgusting characters and such. All in all, this movie is definitely not worth four stars-I think three stars is more realistic.",1107302400,2,1213,4.463963963963964

I think those scenes were thrown in as fillers and I reckon the movie could have done without them. Like the old guy just throwing insults?? It wasn't even funny?!?!

Sandler's character Henry meets a spirited girl named Lucy (Barrymoore) who has suffered a brain injury as a result of a car accident that happened a year ago.  Lucy has no short term memory, and she wakes up every morning with no memory of the day before...and no memory of Henry.

The chemistry between Sandler and Barrymoore is incredible, and that's the real reason why this movie works.  There is also a great supporting cast, including Sean Astin as Lucy's dimwitted, steroid-addicted brother, and Rob Schneider as Henry's uncouth (and hilarious) Hawaiian friend.

Regardless of the fact that there are a lot of holes in the plot, the characters are fantastic and you'll be rooting for them until the end.  I was a bit disappointed with the ending (why couldn't Lucy have slammed into another cow and had her memory restored?), but I guess it was as good as it could be under the circumstances.

But this movie was just so romantic and sweet that it is hard to brush it aside after watching it. It is one of those very rare love moives that get stuck in your head forever.

We have to agree that every love movie needs something that represents ""eternity"", or else it wouldn't have a chance standing to be a ""love movie"". The ""eternity"" factor in ""50 First Dates"" is the fact that the girl is eternally forgetful of who the guy is and the guy is eternally trying to make the girl fall in love with him, every single day. It's hard to find something sweeter and more romantic than that.

I definitely recommend this movie~~

The movie starts with adams character going at with all the girls but dumping them soon after until one afternoon he finds himself visiting a calm ocean side restaurant where he meets Lucy(Drew Barrymore) who day after day he would fall in love with until he has to think of an appropriate method for her to live her life the best she possibly can.#

5469114,4,B00AQ5U234,"It's a heartwarming blend of action, comedy, and romance as Adam Sandler, and a band of hilarious animals you haven't seen the likes of since Eddie Murphy in Doctor Doolittle, start dating pretty Drew Barrymore.  I could have sworn some of the animals were the very same ones!  And wasn't the little spider monkey the same monkey that appeared years ago in FRIENDS?  Anyhow Hawaiian locations bring out the best in all the animals, and in our romantic love interests, Adam and Drew, neither of whom have ever been as appealing, not even in their previous blockbuster together, THE WEDDING SINGER.  Though I will say it was hard to believe in Adam Sandler as some kind of ladies' man because, well, he has only average looks and from some angles looks doped up.  The producers of this film have cast him as some kind of sex magnet, the sort of role Cary Grant used to play.  Anyhow, once he meets and falls head over heels for Drew, he becomes more plausible.  Indeed she is charming, though her disease, as Dan Aykroyd explains it, is kind of tragic.

The director Peter Segal who made ANGER MANAGEMENT, again with Adam, has performed a subtler job this time around.  The cliches of romantic comedy prove themselves anew.  And the animal action would please even Doris Day.  I hope she gets a chance to see this movie.  Perhaps she would agree to perform in the sequel.",1105574400,2,1369,4.6115702479338845

5469118,5,B00AQ5U234,"Adam Sandler is my favorite comedian, and I can watch almost any Adam Sandler movie and find myself laughing a whole lot.  On the other hand, I am not a huge fan of chick flicks(probably because I'm a guy) but I can enjoy a romantic comedy if I like the actors and the humor is really good. Adam Sandler's first movie with Drew Barrymore, 1998's ""The Wedding Singer"" was very funny, and while the second film with Sandler and Barrymore, 2004's ""50 First Dates"" is not as good as ""The Wedding Singer"" was, it still does deliver a lot of laughs.

This time, Adam Sandler is Henry Roth, a Hawaii bachelor who is looking for the right girl, and even though Roth spends every night with a different Hawaiian tourist, he really wants a girl he can spend his life with.  Then, one day, Roth meets Lucy  (Barrymore)at a restaurant.  Roth starts talking to her, and she seems to like him, but the next day, she doesn't remember him.  This is when Roth learns that Lucy was in a car accident, and as a result, when Lucy wakes up every day, her memory is gone, and her family and friends try to help her get her memory back.  What this means for Roth is that every day, if he wants to spend his life with Lucy (who he has found to be the girl of his dreams) he must keep doing certain things to help her remember him, and from this point on during the rest of the movie, you will be in for a wild, hilarious ride.

""50 First Dates"" is one of the best films of 2004.  It also co-stars Rob Schneider and Allen Covert, and both Schneider and Covert are as funny as usual.  There are also special features on this DVD, which include a director and cast commentary, deleted scenes with an optional commentary, the making of this film, music videos, a Comedy Central Reel Comedy Special, a gag reel, a talkin' pidgin featurette, filmographies, and previews.  There is also a small advertisement for the new Adam Sandler album, ""Shh...Don't Tell"". ""50 First Dates"" is a great movie and a great film to have on DVD, and it is a romantic comedy both men and women will enjoy.",1104105600,5,2055,4.353403141361256
5469119,4,B00AQ5U234,"This is a charming, increasingly romantic movie about a brain-damaged woman (Drew Barrymore) who loses her memory of the current day as soon as she goes to sleep. So when a marine veterinarian (Adam Sandler) falls for her, he has to woo her afresh each new day. Since I don't care for most of Sandler's juvenile humor and flabby acting, I was very surprised to find that I like not only this story, but Sandler as the love interest. Here, he is neither slack-jawed nor whiny, but somebody likeable enough to root for. Although the plot sounds contrived to be sort of Groundhog Day meets Memento -- this story feels like it maybe coulda happened, because of Drew's emotional range and the chemistry of the stars. The story often  is funny in a silly way -- love the great kids and animals! -- and all the parts were well cast, including Astin and Schneider (who I did not recognize until reading the credits). For me, the film got better and more involving as it built, and it was ultimately satisfying and touching as Sandler figured out a way to adapt the relationship to his love's limitations. When people call this movie slow, I think it's because people are used to sitcoms and are not patient with films that show characters developing -- it takes time that one doesn't have to invest in broader comedies. But I found it rewarding and much more memorable in the end.

I loved almost everything about this movie.  The only thing I didn't like was Rob Schneider (?).  He was funny, but kinda silly.  Anyways, the premise of the story is cool.  Lucy was involved in an accident and it affected her ability to remember ANYTHING past the day of the accident. Adam's character does not realize this at first, but when he does, he tries EVERYDAY to help Lucy cope with finding out about the accident.

What follows is absolutely the SWEETEST thing you could ever imagine someone doing in this situation. He helps her find out what happened to her every day and proceeds to make her fall in love with him everyday.  I'm not sure how realistic the injury is portrayed, but even still, the patience he uses to make her feel comfortable with him is incredible.

He works in Hawaii, and usually dates the tourists that visit there, but he never wants to commit to a long-term relationship. Henry just wants to date women and leave them. He lies to them saying that he has to leave the country or that he is a secret agent on a top secret assignment. One morning while going for breakfast at a local cafe he meets Lucy  (played by Drew Barrymore) and there is instant attraction between the both of them. After they talked they promised to meet at the same cafe for breakfast the following day. Next day comes Henry, sees Lucy, but lucy doesn't remember who Henry is and gets freaked out. We Find out that Lucy was in a car accident, which caused her some brain damage. The brain damage affects her short-term memory (though her long-term memory is still intact). Lucy forgets things following day. Lucy lives with her dad and brother who are protective of her because they don't have sleazy men to take advantage of lucy's memory lapses (or use her for sex only). Henry is love-struck however, and he is determined to prove to them all that his feeling for Lucy are real. Every day he introduces himself to Lucy and get her to fall in love with him. He always has to start over the next day, it may sound repetitous, but they added different scenes to make the dates feel and look different each time. Sandler detracts from the man/child character typecast from his other movies: this time Adam Sandler's character becomes sweet and honest because he is in real love , he realized that Lucy is that ""special someone"" so he persistant and patient. Drew Barrymore's character is charming, funny and sweet, there is excellent chemistry between Barrymore and Sandler, they are both very funny and lovable.

5469132,4,B00AQ5U234,"Like MEMENTO, this is a movie that deals with a person with ""short-term memory"" loss. I put the term I just used in quotes, because, although it is standard psychological term, it is clearly a confusing misnomer. ""Short-term memory"" is clearly NOT the shortest term memory that we have. If it were, a person who had lost all short-term memory could not complete an intelligible sentence. He or she would have no memory from one syllable to the next what he or she were talking about. But both the main character in MEMENTO and Lucy in this movie can carry on seemingly ""normal"" converstions with people over certain periods of time. Perhaps that is one reason why their disability is all the more troublesome. It can appear to be no disability at all for a while to any observer. Lucy in this movie could appear entirely to have a ""normal"" memory as long as she is awake during a given day. But after she had slept, one could observe that she retained no memory of the previous day. The guy in MEMENTO had a shorter period over which he could remember ""new"" memories, but still over a sufficiently short period, he remembered things ""normally"" so as to completely baffle somebody as to why he would have to write down the simplest of directions or he would promptly forget them. Neither movie paints any clear picture of what ""short-term memory"" is that concurs with or can build upon what little I learned about the term in the psychology course that I took. Allegedly, according to fans of one or both of these movies, losing ""short-term memory"" means no longer being able to form new memories. The paradox here is that these subjects efinitely DO remember new things, but only for short terms, It is said that their ""long-term memories"" ae intact, but in a literal sense of speaking, long-term memory of anythig happening after the accident that deprived them of ""short-term memory"" is excactly what they DON""T have. So, when one loses ""short-term"" memory but retains ""long-term"" memory, memories of new events become troublesomely short-term. Shouldn't that mean that ""long-term"" memory is what is really impaired? Maybe it all makes sense if properly explained. Ardent fans of movies like this often insist that it is all perfectly clear and those of us who point out the confusing paradoxes are just dummies. That doesn't help. If more movies dealing with the subject are to be made, I hope some will really clarify it. By the way, subjects of movies do come to have long-term realization that they DO have ""short-term memory loss. And that is something that they couldn't have learned before their accidents, because it wasn't the case until after the accidents. Gee, I wish clarification could be found somewhere.

What redeems this movie somewhat, to make it worthy of four stars, is that it does tell a touching and OFTEN coherent story of Lucy and her disability, even though it only confuses in implying both that her condition can ""never get better"" but also that she can learn to know and accept her condition better from day to day and she can form a long-term relationship with someone she met since her accident. Overall though, it tells a more coherent story than MEMENTO, and injects enough humor and charm to make a movie that is highly watchable. Some have said that the humor clashes withe the movie's serious theme. I can see how it has that feeling at times. But if you consider where the movie would be without the humor, I think the humor more enhances than impairs the ability to make this a palatable story.",1100044800,7,3535,4.72933549432739

5469135,4,B00AQ5U234,"I absolutely adore this movie! It's sweet and funny. It makes you laugh and cry. I do admit that somethings in the movie were a little annoying, the little obvious things that were thrown in there, specifically bc they knew it would make people laugh. While, yes I DID think these little pieces were funny, they were somewhat annoying strictly bc they didn't seem to fit seamlessly into the movie...as if they filmed the entire movie and thought ""we need more time and funny stuff"" and then cut and pasted these in.

I convinced my bf to watch this movie with me and he liked it. (He found the small ""annoying"" parts completely hilarious...go figure *^-^*)So obviously they did something right.

I have to point out that someone mentioned earlier, Adam Sandler basically plays the same parts in all his movies. I'm glad I'm not the only one to have noticed this. While I like some of his movies, I don't like them ALL. And I wasn't really expecting all too much from this movie. I was curious about it, and was told that it was a really funny & cute movie. But I probably wouldn't have seen it, had I not bought it for my sister as a gift, and she insisted we sit down right then and watch it.

Well, I'm glad I did *^-^*

This movie is DEFINATELY worth seeing! (and buying!)

Although, I've noticed this movie is about 50/50. You'll either love it or hate it. So I suggest NOT buying it until after you've seen it, unless you are some sort of die-hard Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore fan.",1098748800,5,1488,4.416058394160584

She keeps re-living the same day in her mind--the result of an accident involving me and a heavy, metal bat.  Just kidding, it was a car crash or something, not me with a metal bat...

The thing that irritated me the most about this movie (besides the whole ""Remember Happy Gilmore?"" vibe) was Rob Schneider.  This man has become gradually more irritating.  I laughed at sensitive naked guy, and I could stomach him in some other Adam Sandler-sidekick role, but this...I wanted to sew the other half of his shirt and strike him throughout his every appearance.

Adam Sandler was okay as the befuddled, romantic guy.  Drew Barrymore fell right into the role of forgetful idiot.  And Dan Akroyd makes an appearance as a doctor.  A doctor bloated and stuffed with cheese puffs.  All in all, not worth buying or reproducing for the stage.",1098662400,2,1028,4.7897727272727275

  From the beginning you hear many women telling about their vacations to Hawaii, and meeting Henry Roth.  He woos them, and then before they leave he makes up some kind of story so that he will never have to see or talk to them again.  He doesn't want to settle down because he has plans to take his boat to Alaska so he can study walruses.  This was all until he met Lucy.  This is no ordinary girl, every night when she goes to sleep her memory of everything that happend after her accident she can't remember.  This gives Henry a challenge because he really likes her, but its rather difficult when she can never remember who he is.

  This movie has a great plot line.  It's unlike any other movie I have seen before.  From beginning to end I was laughing.  Adam Sandler is hilarious, as well as Drew Berrymore.  Adam and Drew are great together and and you can really see how comfortable they are together.  I hope to see them working together sometime soon in the future.",1097452800,2,1167,4.299539170506913

ISN'T LOVE SO BEAUTIFUL?

Henry Roth, a Vet whose afraid of commitments so he meets women on vacation wine, dine, and lie until the trip is over finds himself falling for Lucy the waffle teepee maker who is unaware of the fact that she does the same thing daily cause in her mind she's a year behind.

I thought that this was a nice romantic comedy and although all the other reviewers are blowing it like too predictable and comparing it to Ground Hog Day, I say that it was a good film that is good enough for a first date, maybe some of the guys will recall how well to treat the women!",1097280000,2,834,4.006024096385542
5469139,3,B00AQ5U234,"In ""50 First dates"" - which might well be subtitled ""When 'Memento' Met `Groundhog Day`"" - Drew Barrymore plays a young woman whose short term memory has been destroyed in a car accident a few months prior to the time of the story.  As a result, Lucy wakes up every morning still believing it is the day of the accident, while every night her memory of that current day is wiped away while she sleeps.  Her father and her brother have devised an elaborate charade to avoid her finding out the truth, assuming that she will live a much happier life if she is kept in blissful ignorance of her condition.  Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a veterinarian who's deathly afraid of commitment and figures Lucy is the perfect woman for him.  He can woo her afresh every day, secure in the knowledge that their relationship will never have to advance much beyond the getting-to-know-you stage - though this doesn`t make for a very logical plan since winning her over day after day requires a lot more work and effort than a conventional relationship ever would.  Nevertheless, this seems to Henry to be the ideal setup, until, of course, he begins to actually fall for the hapless young woman, revealing that he is not quite the callous rogue he appears to be on the surface.

Your enjoyment of  ""50 First Dates"" may be predicated on just how willing you are to accept brain damage as a source of mirth and high comedy.  If you are somehow able to quell the queasiness that comes with the premise, you might be charmed by what happens in the film.

This is basically a gimmicky, one-joke comedy that indulges in far too many distractions to be very successful.  There is, admittedly, a certain sweetness to many of the scenes involving Barrymore and Sandler as they try to make a go of this highly unusual courtship.  The final scene, in particular, has a kind of offbeat poignancy that feels both daring and satisfying.  However, the film is populated by a whole host of annoying characters who work overtime to deaden the charm: Lucy's steroid-obsessed brother, Henry's creepy co-workers, and even an anthropomorphic walrus who high-fives his trainer, mugs for the camera, and vomits on cue - and whose sizable genitalia serves as the source for one of the many lowbrow gags that run through the film.

In ""Punch Drunk Love,"" Sandler proved that he has the potential to stretch as an actor. Barrymore has yet to make that case.  Her wide-eyed, innocent ingnue shtick has become a trifle threadbare by now.  It's time for her to take a leap of faith into more challenging roles and show us what - if anything - else she can do.",1097280000,2,2618,4.636363636363637
5469140,3,B00AQ5U234,"Strangely similar to Groundhog Day, except that the Drew Barrymore has no clue she's living the same day over and over. I can see why they thought this would make for an interesting movie. It sounds good in theory, it even sounds funny if you were talking about it - like if you were to pitch the movie to a producer. ""See, it's about this girl that has this accident where she loses all short term memory. And you know, just think of it...how can she ever date anyone? See the potential? See the humor??? We could even get Adam Sandler to star!""

Sadly, however, the movie doesn't succeed as well as the pitch. Maybe it's the screenwriter's fault. Too many jokes at the expense of those with head injuries. A guy can't remember anything beyond 10 seconds. Haha, yeah, so funny. Whoa, until you think about it for a moment and realize how horrible life would be for that guy. Depressing.

Not a bad movie, because sometimes it's funny, but the seriousness of the subject (brain damage - an injury that never heals) sort of brings down any feel-good charm they are trying to convey. The ending is actually more sad than uplifting. I almost wanted to cry. I don't mind crying, but dang it - make up your mind what sort of movie this is, guys. Comedy or tearjerker! Gah.",1096502400,2,1267,4.456896551724138
5469141,5,B00AQ5U234,"I've read some of the reviews and have to disagree with them - this is a really sweet movie.  Adam Sandler's character (Henry) is the typical luv 'em and leave 'em kind of guy before he meets Drew Barrymore's character, Lucy.  Due to brain damage from a car accident a year earlier, Lucy can't convert short term memory into long term memory - she keeps replaying the same day over and over.  Henry is intrigued by this at first, and tries each day to get Lucy to like him.  After awhile, though, he truly starts to care for her and wants to help her move on with her life.  Other characters - the friends from the bar and Lucy's father - are super in how they protect her by replaying the same day over with her.  Her brother is definitely doofy, but easily ignored.  This movie is a romance with a happy ending.  Prepare to smile alot and maybe even cry a few tears!",1096243200,3,868,4.25

5469144,3,B00AQ5U234,"When a movie takes a serious theme (in this case memory loss resulting from a serious accident) and tries to put it in a zany comdey, the disparate elements are prone to clash, and this movie is no exception. Drew Barrymore plays someone who lives each day with no memory of the previous day or any other day since an accident that virtually destroyed her short-term memory (a term yet to be made perfectly clear by movies dealing therewith). Then into her life come a character played by Adam Sandler, as well as some of his friends played by similarly comic oriented actors, including Rob Schneider. Sandler's character wants to court the affections of the woman deprived of short-term memory. But how can he do that when she can meet him one day but then he's a stranger to her the next because of her condition? Well, the movie never completely explains how he can, and leaves the audience wondering if the serious part of the movie has any authenticity to it whatsoever. The young woman's doctor insists that her condition has no capacity for improvement. Nonetheless she seeems to somehow assimilate some ongoing memory, of some sort, of her suitor. She will eventually paint pictures inspired by him on days before she's seen him that day, and later remember having dreams of him. Nonetheless her new memories past a day are so vague and shadowy that the audience never gets a hint as to how they might really develop a meaningful long term relationship. For that reason, suffice it to say (without giving away too much), they do embark on a course that stretches credibility in light of her condition and leaves the audience much wanting for explanation.

Not surprisingly for a movie with Adam Sandler and others of similar comic talents, there's plenty of screwball comedy (physical and otherwise) thrown in. One of Sandler's hapless friends gets caught in the torrent of massive projectile vomiting by a walrus, for example. But the screwball physical comedy goes on to even involve the movie's tragic heroine. Part of her suitor's early attempts to get to her include posing as a robbery victim, as he expects the girl of his dreams to come along and hopefully rescue him. He get's Schneider's character to pose as the robber. Unfortunately for the latter hapless character, the movie's heroine turns out to be a member of neighborhood watch, who plays hardball with offenders. As a result, the poor fake robber, who is really a friend of the fake victim, gets beaten senseless for his supposed deeds just the same as if his crimes were for real. Watching the heroine exact such ""justice"" (as far as she knows) while also sympathizing with her serious medical condition is something of a schizophrenic experience. And it is just one example of the often conflicting serious and comic elements in this uneven but sometimes appealing movie.",1095292800,6,2850,4.840163934426229
5469145,4,B00AQ5U234,"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore team up once again in 50 First Dates. Their first foray together in The Wedding Singer was a raving success. I enjoyed that one so much that I watched it more times than I could count. I love the 80's theme and the cutesy song he composed for her at the end of the movie.

Ok, back to 50 First Dates. I can find no fault with this movie and found it very touching at some parts. Both leads were ok when they were together but there was more focus on their interactions and relationships with the other supporting actors in the movie. It's like a community love story.

This movie about commitment-phobic man Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) who strives to capture the heart of a cute girl Lucy (Drew Barrymore) every single day because she has a weird brain disfunction. Lucy could not remember a single thing that happened after a bad car accident she was involved in. They made the car accident bit into a spoof of Mission Impossible 2 which was hilarious in a corny kind of way. So day after day she meets Henry, falls in love with him and forgets all about him when she wakes up the next morning. The perfect girl for a commitment-phobic guy? You bet, but not in the way that you think.

The comedy factor was good. There were some hilarious shots of what two people who are giddy with the euphoria of finally meeting the person of their dreams would do. However, I did not enjoy the parts where Adam Sandler made fun of his earnest German colleague by calling her a man. Surely, there is no need for cruel humor of this sort.

It was a treat to see Dan Ackroyd in a cameo role of the doctor (or was it the neurosurgeon?) and the other supporting actors who played Barrymore's dad and brother were great in their respective roles.

But the biggest treat of all was seeing Rob Schneider as the Hawaiian, Ula. He was so convincing as a Hawaiian bum that I did not recognise him as the Hot Chick Rob Schneider. Imagine the shock I had seeing his name when the credits were rolling.

I loved how the movie started (won't share it here because it will spoil your enjoyment of it) and how it ended. It was amazing to see how a commitment-phobe like Sandler turning 180 degrees because of the challenge of getting a girl who is worse than he is. He forgets a girl after a week but she can only remember him for 24 hours or less.

While I admire the transformation and tenacity of the man, it makes me wonder if someone who has no short-term memory like Lucy is really the cure for commitment-phobic people. Hmmm...",1095033600,5,2536,4.360169491525424
5469146,2,B00AQ5U234,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just left me just a little disappointed.  Sure, it was a pleasant and cheap way to spend an evening, but it just did not draw me in.  Perhaps the humor was just a little to adolescent, and the character development a little to predictable- the potty humor of the Drew Barrymore characters brother was unnecessary and the silly characterization of support characters (i.e., the German lady) was a distraction

The premise, though unlikely, could have been workable; but as I watched it, I could not help but think how much better Groundhog Day covered the same material.  So, if you are thinking about a comic romance, skip Fifty First Dates and rent Groundhog day.",1094860800,,707,4.723577235772358

Big Daddy 5/5, I don't know why I think this is his best film, but this never gets old.

Eight Crazy Nights 4.5/5, This is animated but is still one of his best films, even to watch after christmas.

Billy Madison 4.5/5, This is one of his earlier films, and one that doesnt get old.

The WaterBoy 4/5, Funny and it has a good lesson, still one of the better Sandler films.

Happy Gilmore 4/5, A golfer that has an anger problem.

Mr. Deeds 4/5, Probably the last one im going to put as a Sandler movie that doesnt get old.

Little Nicky 3.5/5, Still a pretty good film, but it dose get old if you watch it too much(like I did.)

Bulletproof 3.5/5, more of a drama, but still has funny parts, an Ok Sandler film.

50 First Dates 3/5, Yeah one you cant watch too much like I did, but still funny.

Anger Managment 3/5, same as 50 First Dates, don't watch it too much.

He gets totally reformed overnight and becomes the most selfless, committed, sacrificial man who is willing to wait forever and enjoy a lifelong relationship with a woman who forgets him every day.  Sure. Maybe if he would have been a virgin looking for his one true love then it would have been beliveable.

And all the boob, ass, homo, vomit, sex jokes are just plain mindless and talentless.

""Wedding Singer"" co-star Drew Barrymore along with Sean Astin

(The Return of the King) and Rob Schneider (The Hot Chick).

Henry Roth(Sandler) is a womanizer who looks for a fling then dumps her for the fear of long time commitment. But one day in a restraunt he sees Lucy Whitmore(Barrymore) and falls in love at first sight. He talks to her and it seems he may have found his soulmate. Problem is when he comes in the next day she doesn't seem to remember him. He finds out she has short term memory loss,

and then begins the foolish and sometimes hilarious attempts to

win her over the next day,and the next day,and the next day.

Problem #2 is that her father and her brother(Astin) want him to

stay away from their daughter thinking all Henry wants is a one night stand. But Henry refuses to stop making the movie get funnier and funnier until the last 15 minutes when it turns into a happy sappy ending,that makes the movie slow up a little bit.

Rob Schneider is hilarious as Henry's friend Ula or something like that. George Wing who wrote the script shows a promising screenwriting career. And also,this is one of Sandler's best films. Not his funniest,but one of his best. Lets hope his next

Our fair lady has been in an accident and is now left with short term memory. Our young man cannot help but fall in love with her and against all odds decides they are going to have a life together.

Perhaps I am a Romantic, or I just love happy endings but I really did like this movie.  Although it didn't end perfect, and they still had challenges to overcome; it showed if you have love you can conquer mountains, and life may very well be what you make of it.

This is a good movie to remind us all of that fact.  Enjoy!

5469158,3,B00AQ5U234,"Maybe I have high expectations. Is that a bad thing? But when I saw that both Adam Sandler AND Drew Barrymore were going to be in a film together, I thought it would phenomenal. This could finally be competition with Sandler's classics 'Happy Gilmore,' and 'Billy Madison.'

When I finally saw the movie, I must say that I was less than impressed. Parts of it were rather funny, and the character quirks were amusing. And I suppose that the idea of someone with anterograde amnesia being persued by a seemingly 'normal' person should be a good enough story line to appease someone looking for something new in their movies. But something was missing. Yes, it was touching that Sandler fell in love with Barrymore. And, yes, it is amazing that he makes her fall in love with him everyday. But isn't that kind of wierd? It seems to fall more into the category of dark comedy pulled off poorly. It could have been more witty and subtle if aimed more for the art-house enthusiasts, but instead, too much slapstick was used to make it more appealing to the masses. In the end, yeah, I thought the movie was cute, but flawed. It definitely wasn't all that I had hoped it to be.",1092700800,,1171,4.523584905660377
5469159,4,B00AQ5U234,"I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan, but occasionally, he makes an okay movie.  In my opinion, his only truly good movie has been The Wedding Singer; in an attempt to revisit the chemistry that he had with Drew Barrymore in that film, the two have been reunited in 50 First Dates.  While not as good as their first matchup, this is nonetheless a decent movie.

The premise of the story is that Barrymore has been injured in an auto accident and as a result has lost her short-term memory.  Every day, she wakes up and thinks it is the same Sunday when she had the accident.  Sandler falls for her, but every day needs to win her again.  It is Groundhog Day in reverse:  everyone else is aware that she is living the same day over and over again.

This movie could go in a lot of obvious directions and to its credit, it doesn't.  The result is a pleasant diversion: not a classic by any means, but at least a small cut above a lot of the romantic ""comedies"" out there today.",1092700800,2,971,4.205405405405405
5469160,5,B00AQ5U234,"Generally, I like Adam Sandler's movies.  I love ""Happy Gilmore"" as well as ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" which are two very different movies that are good for very different reasons.  ""Happy Gilmore"" is simply good-natured broad comedy that keeps the laughs coming, and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is an unusual low-budget drama that demonstrates that Sandler is a good actor as well as a good comedian.

""50 First Dates"" falls somewhere between those two films in terms of tone and of Sandler's character.  It has many funny parts (including a great golf bit for us ""Happy Gilmore"" fans), but takes the time to establish Sandler's character.  He delivers a great performance.  So does Drew Barrymore, whose inherent likeability really shines.  She is very believable in this role, which calls for her to have quite different responses to Sandler at quite different times.

Perhaps the biggest flaw in this movie is the instant change in Sandler's character from an island Casanova to a devoted one-woman man when he meets Barrymore.  However, I just didn't dwell on it too much; the film would also have us believe that he lives in an apartment in a marine park that has a window opening onto the big aquarium tank, which is ultimately far less believable (although it is pretty cool).

The cinematography is beautiful!  This movie looks far more cinematic than most comedies, which are often shot as if they were made for television.  The colors are bright and rich, and Hawaii has rarely looked more like paradise.  You will want to get the widescreen edition to fully appreciate how great this movie looks.",1092614400,2,1592,4.93984962406015

The premise is not so new --- the old amnesia thing --- but the idea of trying to make somebody fall in love with you again everyday provides ample opportunity for some silly, sweet wooing.  Like the Wedding Singer before it, these two display a great timing with and appreciation of what each other brings to the screen.  Sean AStin is also quite amusing in a supporting role. There is also a nifty reggae soundtrack that reworks some of the 80's classics.  Overall it makes for an sweetly enjoyable diversion.",1092614400,2,684,4.675

Not so. Despite a ridiculous plot, 50 First Dates works, perhaps because Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have such great chemistry. There are a few scattered laughs here and there but what really works for the film are the dramatic aspects. The film comes across as light and fluffy but the plot is very serious and I feel it played best as a drama, rather than a comedy. There are some great dramatic moments that really worked and gave the characters emotional depth, something we don't see often in romantic comedies. The film is funny enough and very sweet, so it does have that perfect balance, which is a big plus.

The beautiful Hawaiian locations and terrific supporting cast really add to the film and make it more special. This is one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I have ever seen. It's not a brilliant film, but it's very cute and great fun, and a big improvement over other romantic comedies. I recommend this one, I really liked it.",1091923200,3,1128,4.556650246305419

5469171,5,B00AQ5U234,"50 first dates, Sandler and Barrymore's second venture together, turns out to be Funny, Charming and often Sentimental. While they were extremely lovable in The Wedding Singer the two now proove that they are the dynamic duo of the romantic comedy. Like Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, or Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, we want more of Sandler and Barrymore. I believe they both have this wonderful sense of vivacious, carefree and sincere deliveries that make them top of my list for Romantic Comedy duo!

 The film was absolutely enjoyable from start to finish. Creative storyline told in a charmingly funny way. The subject matter is rather heavy but it is portrayed a little more light hearted and Barrymore is such an adorably likable actress that you want to see more. Sandler is the unlikely romantic lead which is all the more reason to root for him! In the Wedding Singer we were charmed when he sang ""I want to grow old with you"" to Julia on the plane, now we are charmed with how many different ways he can make her fall in love with him, day after day after day...

 Enjoyable performances by an always creative Rob Schneider, Dan Aykroyd and a lisping, weightlifting Sean Astin! (Whatever happened to the fat Samwise?)

 DVD specifications are great too! Widescreen 2:35:1. There are deleted scenes, bloopers, and a hilarious mock interview with Rob Schneider as Ula interviewing Adam, Drew and Sean! Hilarious!

 I laughed, I was touched, I thoroughly enjoyed my two hours. Time well spent. I request that the dynamic duo do more films in the near future to help keep us entertained and charmed all over again.",1090713600,4,1617,4.770609318996415

A year before their meeting Lucy had an accident which deprived her of long term memories. This means that every day she has to start again. Her friends convince Henry to leave her alone, but he can't get her out of his mind.

Thus starts a series of interesting meetings where he tries to get to know her, and make her fall in love with him all over again every single day.

However, Henry must not only win her over, but her family and friends as well.

5469189,4,B00AQ5U234,"50 First Dates is a charming movie that stands out above some of Sandler's other work for several reasons.  First, Sandler basically plays himself, not some strange character like ""Little Nicky"" or ""Waterboy"".  Second, Drew Barrymore is such a sweet character on screen and the chemistry with Sandler is strong.
This is closer to a romantic comedy but still retains the quirks of all Sandler films.  Rob Schneider plays a native Hawaiian with several kids and is the butt of many jokes.  Sean Astin of Rudy and The Lord of the Rings fame is hilarious as Drew Barrymore's sister.  He plays a work-out freak with a lisp.  Other things to look for include the homage to Happy Gilmore and the return of the guy who played the QB in Waterboy.
50 First Dates is a good movie because despite all the wacky characters and jokes, you can sense Sandler really cares for Barrymore, and you can also see the love and effort Astin and Barrymore's father put forth in protecting Barrymore from the realization that everyday is a new day and she'll never have a memory of the past.",1089763200,,1066,4.613756613756614

Adam cast, for once, a women that was more then ""her"" more then a playmate to crack up in the course of filmmaking ... he also brought in the best preformance of Drew Berrymores carrer ...
Drew brought into this movie more then the star appeal and sexuality that she brings to the 'Charlies Angels' movies.

5469207,4,B00AQ5U234,"Adam Sandler does not have remarkable acting range, but he makes a fine romantic foil for Drew Barrymore and they recapture some of the chemistry they exhibited in The Wedding Singer.
Drew has the kind of medical condition that pretty much only exists in the movies.  She's had an auto accident, and every morning when she wakes up, she thinks it's the morning of the auto accident.  Essentially the same condition as the hero in ""Memento"", except where his memory lasted minutes at best, Barrymore can remember everything she learned that day - until she goes to sleep again.  Mercifully, she's not as bad as the ""10 Second Tom"" character we meet in the movie.
That device sets us up for endless variations for Adam Sandler to get Drew to become interested in him over and over again - reminiscent of Groundhog Day.
The ""formula"" of romantic comedy is guy meets girl, they fall in love, some contrivance tears them apart, (at this point usually the female heads for an airport as the male suddenly remembers that he's in a romantic comedy and he has to run willy-nilly to and through the airport in an effort to tell her what a dunderhead he's been and how much he really loves her before the credits roll.)
The formula is toyed with a little bit in this movie, and to everyone's credit, they make it interesting.  Since Lucy wakes up every morning not remembering anything since the car crash, and her memory condition is permanent, we begin to wonder how things will end.  Perhaps it's NOT the *happy ending* to have these characters wind up together - either for him or her.

But when he walks into a Cafe one morning and sees Lucy, the girl of his dreams, everything changes.  They set up a date, but to no avail, because Lucy (Drew Barrymore) suffers from a loss of short term memory. Ever since a tragic accident one year earlier, Lucy's short term memory is only good for as long as she stays awake. Everyday, she wakes up thinking it's the morning the accident took place, with no idea that the tragic event ever happened. This causes terrible problems for Henry. Not only can she never remember who he is after a night's sleep, but everyday he must get her to fall in love with him from scratch. And once poor Henry gets the hang of that little problem, he's got to find a way to progress things, so every day is not another first date.

Although I've always been an Adam Sandler fan, I can't say I went into this expecting very much. Oh, I knew it would be good, but here's the thing; Sandler's self-starring, Happy-Madison productions have ALL been great, but each new one is a little less great than the previous one. Billy Madison is, without a doubt, my favorite of his films. So, after his last comedy, ""Anger Management,"" I was expecting something pretty bland. The first 15 minutes or so didn't give me much to hope for. A pretty cheezy set-up, and lots of bad jokes that didn't even seem like jokes. Now, Sandler has always used odd jokes that don't seem like jokes, but the further back one goes, the more effective they are. That's almost ALL ""Billy Madison"" was comprised of, yet they totally hit the mark in that film. This time around they are just weird and sad. In the beginning at least. That's the whole thing about this film. It's just the beginning that kinda sucks.  Stick with it and you'll really be glad in the end. After Act 1, ""50 First Dates"" becomes an outstanding romantic comedy! A truly heartwarming film that will make you want to fall in love, if you aren't in love already! Even those weird jokes get better as the film rolls along. The performances are all really great, if one is used to Sandler's own style of acting. I've never been much of a Barrymore fan, but she is actually really loveable in this flick. It's great to see the wonderful Blake Clark in a pretty large role this time around too. Rob Schneider is always hilarious, and totally believable as a Hawaiian native! And, legend in my book,  Dan Aykroyd even puts in his two cents as Lucy's doctor. But the actor who steals the show is former hobbit and Goonie Sean Astin, who is hilarious as Lucy's steroid chugging brother. All the characters are highly believable and very sympathetic. You can't help but root for...well, everybody! There are no villains here other than Lucy's persistent memory loss, which is tragic and endearing. What makes the film so wonderful in the end though, is that they don't rely on a cheap, easy-way-out, happy miracle ending. This movie is about how the love of those who care about us can help get us through difficult circumstances, or help us live with them. It's also about perseverance, and not letting anything stand in the way of true love. Oh, and adorable marine animals too!",1088035200,2,3262,4.561433447098976

Rob Schneider, another person I can't stand is actually extremely funny. And Sandler is great, measurate and endearing. Even the scatological jokes work!

I also really appreciated the artistic direction: Drew Barrymore plays an artist/art teacher, and the film is full or delightful examples of ""her"" paintings and journal entries which, while not sophisticated (in keeping with her character) are done with a lot of color and verve.  But the very derivative plot (as in Groundhog Day) and hackneyed dialogue just don't live up to the production values.  The acting is so-so, but then most of the parts are more caricatures than characters, so I don't necessarily blame the actors.

5469220,3,B00AQ5U234,"""50 First Dates"" is a big, loveable puppy dog of a romantic comedy. It bounds all over the place, wags its tail, and begs to be liked. Like a big dog, it is sometimes messy and doesn't always make much sense. But its relentless affability wins you over.
The movie has little in common with sophisticated successes like ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". ""50 First Dates"" asks us to believe that love conquers all, no questions asked. Either you buy the concept or you don't.
Henry [Adam Sandler] is a veterinarian who has a way with women. Living the good life in Hawaii, there seems to be no end to his conquests. One day, in a quaint little restaurant, he meets an intriguing woman named Lucy [Drew Barrymore]. They hit it off and promise to meet again. The problem is that, when Henry meets Lucy again, she acts as if she has never met him. It turns out that Lucy lost her short-term memory in a car crash. When she wakes up each day, she doesn't remember the previous day. Undaunted, Henry teams up with Lucy's family to force her to remember him.
Ironically, much of makes the movie work is that neither of its stars are that naive. Both Sandler and Barrymore are worldly creatures. Theirs are tongue-in-cheek performances. They also have together what used to be called `chemistry'. They make a most believable couple.
Lucy's illness doesn't exist in the real world. It's just another in a long line of movie illnesses which Hollywood has been inventing for decades. At least here, there is no miraculous cure, which makes for a satisfactory ending. To say more would be to spoil the movie.",1087776000,,1622,4.615916955017301

5469224,3,B00AQ5U234,"'50 First Dates' is Sandler in his typical innocuous role just as he has in nearly every role he's been in since he started making movies. I don't have a tendancy to like him. His humour is way OTT most of the time, and it does get just a tad tiresome. And sometimes, he has a face only a mother could love. However, this film is a bit better than Anger Management, but instead of Jack Nicholson, you have Drew Barrymore.
People say this is a remake of Groundhog Day, but with Adam Sandler trying to get some laughs. I just don't see it. For instance, Groundhog Day was actually the same situation everyday until the end of the movie when it all works out. This doesn't really get that repetitive (unless you're Drew Barrymore). It shows Adam Sandler in a variety (see that, variety, which is somewhat different to ""the same"") of situations, trying to win Drew's heart in the movie. What is repetitive is 10 Second Tom. God, give the guy a show of his own!
Look out for the performing animals! They're all very, very cute!
As everyone knows, Drew Barrymore's character was in a car crash, and all her short term memory gets erased as soon as her head hits the pillow. So she won't remember anyone new she meets, or what she does. She basically relives the day before the crash (a Sunday), and it's always the same. Enter Adam Sandler, as Henry, to rue the day that she was ever in a car crash. He uses some pretty inventive ideas to try and make her remember him each day, or try and woo her - with some pretty disastrous results. But it's sweet, and hilarious, and some of the putdowns that happen are quite funny.
I wasn't expecting the ending to be what it was. It comes about very suddenly, and it's quite sad actually! I had a little tear, but I think any UB40 song will do that to me anyway!
The extras seem like a lot, but they're not really. I think the commentary with Drew Barrymore and the director would be hilarious. There's a couple of your average, run of the mill featurettes, a blooper reel, deleted scenes, and some stuff about the animals. They thought long and hard about those extras didn't they?
Overall, it's an OK rom-com. Nothing special, but for fans of these damn things!",1087430400,4,2198,4.402948402948403

And the parts that were funny, were carbon copy's of other funny scenes in other sandler movies. It's fun when you recognize a line here and there from other movies, but when there's entire scenes...it gets old fast. It also gets old seeing all the same people in all of his stupid movies. It's cool to see a cameo here and there, but it's always all the same loosers. If I could have avoided seeing it, I would. Kind of a disapointment. Dan Aykroyd had a minor role. The only thing good there was he mentions kallahan auto parts, which in the movie tommy boy, was the company he was trying to forcefully takeover from tommy kallahan.

Apart from Happy Gilmore, I have yet to really enjoy a Sandler movie. This one starts out in the usual Sandler fashion. Gross humor abounds in the initial segments. But, that is when the movie begins to change. Enter Drew Barrymore, another movie star I'm not impressed with, and the movie begins to actually grow on you. Sandlers continual efforts to woo Barrymore reminded me of a hilarious Bill Murray in Groundhog's Day.

Remember Guy Pearce`s character in ""Memento""? Well, in ""50 First Dates"" Drew Barrymore plays Lucy, a girl that loses her recent memory each morning, virtually living the same routine endlessly. Adam Sandler`s character falls in love with her and dares to conquer her attention everyday. Cute, and very touching. Anyway, this movie ends up being too repetitive, slow, empty and especially unfunny, mixing drama and comedy yet failing to suceed at both. The directing is nothing special either, and the performances and characters are flat. Fortunately, the flick still presents some entertainment value, so it`s not a complete disaster. But there are much better movies around (Bernardo Bertolucci`s ""The Dreamers"" or Michel Gondry`s ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", to name a few).

5469232,5,B00AQ5U234,"This is a really good, heart-warming comedy.  As far as Sandler's movies go, this is the best in my opinion, which is not to say much, since I think he made quite a few mediocre ones.  The story is about a guy (Adam) who falls in love with a girl that, since an accident a year earlier, has not been able to gain any new memories past the current day.  The accident was on her father's birthday, so she thinks everyday of the year is it, making everyone around her put on a show.  A little unbelievable, but the movie does make the story work quite nicely.
In 50 First Dates, the viewer sees a side to Adam Sandler that is not known; he does his usual physical and witty comedy, but he also demonstrates a sensitive side.  Drew Barrymore also is very funny, though her character is by nature a strange one (with no memory beyond a day).  The supporting cast is outstading, especially Rob Schneider, who definitely adds to the comic nature of the movie.
The story is also a very creative one, with a couple of loose ends but that can be overseen.  For example, Lucy (Drew) is shocked when she first finds out that the life she is living is not real; the next time she finds out, she is a little less shocked, and even less the next time, when we know there should be no diference, since she has no memory of the previous day.

Drew Barrimore is of course HOT HOT HOT but well, something is simply not there. Is it because of a weak script? the direction and the edition are not fantastic either.

If you're looking for an Adam Sandler type comedy, I'd rather recommend There's Something About Mary, which is a comedy with Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz, than this movie.
But don't get me wrong, this is a good MOVIE, but not a good comedy. Rob Schnieder's role is just plain dumb, but Drew Barrymore is what truly makes the movie worthy of watching.

Henry(Adam Sandler) is a marine biologist who dreams that one day the ship that he's been working on really hard could sail around the island of Hawaii.
Until one day he falls in love with a girl at first sight at a diner. Even though he's promised himself he'd only get to know tourists since he won't have to commit himself to one person and enjoyed the quick encounters he has the girl believe he's somebody else completely in,there was something about this girl,Lucy(Drew Barrymore)that really caught his attention. The first day goes smooth but the second day she acts like she's never seen him before..That's when he gets acquainted with  that she has day-long memory,and her father and brother have to pretend it's her father's birthday everyday because that's when she got in the accident that cost her her short term memory...she has found out before and been heartbroken only to wake up the other day without a clue,but Henry isn't willing to give up on her,even when her brother and father tell him to stay away..he uses his knowledge of the previous days to win her love over again everyday.....and maybe there is a solution..

In this one, he's teamed up with Drew Barrymore in a very unfunny attempt to capture some of what they had with The Wedding Singer. It is lost on me. Rob Schneider is about the funny character in this movie, and even that is a stretch. The chemistry between Barrymore and Sandler is terrible, similar to chemistry you'd find on a high school stage.
Essentially, its a romantic comedy without the comedy. OR really the romance for that matter. Barrymore suffers from short term amnesia and Sandler attempts to date her despite this. The best preformance is turned in by a steroid abusing Sean Astin who plays Barrymore's older brother. Sandler is highlighted as the hopeless romantic and creates numerous ways to worm his way into Barrymore's life.
Aside form lacking any particular acting ability, this movie does not even tap into the talents the actors do actually have. Rather than utilize the sight-gags, sarcasm, and slapstick that made Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison great, this movie tried to set up running jokes and scripted humor that just didn't cut it.
There is nothing redeeming about this movie, and if you must see it, wait until it comes out on video. Or see it for the previews.

The dilemma of one Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) is subject to the above tagline, and this young, good-natured, fun-loving gal must begin a life anew each and every day, as a result of her short-term memory loss, which she sustained in an automobile accident en route to her regular weekly pineapple picking ritual, which Lucy had done with her father prior to her accident. She happens to catch the eye of a young, promiscuous veterinarian (Adam Sandler), whose attempts to get to know Lucy, as well as attempting to help fix her medical condition, garner mixed results, of both the hilarious and tear-jerking variety. Also on board, are Lucy's father (Blake Clark) and brother (Sean Astin), with both of them doing their best to help their daughter/sister cope with her difficult struggle, while becoming more skeptical of Lucy's newfound confidant, Henry Roth (Sandler).

Sure there is a couple low-brow humor now and then, but the film manages to sneak in a good amount of sweet humor and chemistry for stars Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler, who previously paired in THE WEDDING SINGER.
When a commitment free vetinarian Sandler falls for Barrymore in a diner, he learns that she has short-term memory loss from an accident and can't remember him! Desperate Sandler then tries his best to have her remember him, despite disdain from her loving father and dimwitted brother, played by Sam Gamgee, er, Sean Astin from the LORD OF THE RINGS.
Anyway, Barrymore and Sandler are the reason why the film is such a hit. These two should do more movies together, because Barrymore's last hit was like ages ago and Sandler's other rotten movies(like LITTLE NICKY AND MR. DEEDS) were no good. They could be the next great screen couple! Part of the reason why they did a good job in this film was because they're really good friends off-screen.
Anyway, 50 FIRST DATES is highly recommended for all you Barrymore and Sandler fans.",1078617600,2,1113,4.712820512820513
5469253,3,B00AQ5U234,"A brief synopsis -- Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) was in a car accident one year ago, and as a result of her injuries has lost all capacity to retain short-term memories (she can still recall everything in her life up until the accident). One day, local playboy and veterinarian Henry Roth (Sandler) meets Lucy in a diner and the two hit it off terrifically. They make plans to meet again the next day, but by then Lucy has entirely forgotten who Henry is. Not to be deterred, Henry tries every possible tactic to woo her, but has to start all over again every day.
My thoughts -- I'm always apprehensive about Adam Sandler movies. I loved The Wedding Singer, but was not at all enthralled with Anger Management. 50 First Dates falls somewhere in between. The basic plotline is very sweet, and could have made a five-star movie, but at some points Sandler falls back into his cruder slapstick mode, ruining otherwise perfect moments. Characters like Ula (Rob Schneider), Henry's grotesque friend, and Alexa (Lusia Strus), his disturbingly manly assistant, serve no real purpose other than to provide a few cheap laughs involving blood, vomit, etc. But Henry and Lucy really do have chemistry, and the scenes that focus on them are very touching. In these instances we see the more sensitive side of Sandler.
The rest of the supporting cast was also hit-or-miss. Many characters were forgettable at best (pardon the unintended pun). But Sean Astin and Blake Clark both turned in great performances. Clark plays Lucy's extremely protective father, who first tries to deter Henry, but eventually comes to work with him in hopes of finding a solution to Lucy's memory problem. Astin is hilarious as Lucy's not-too-bright (and very badly dressed), steroid-popping body-builder brother (though the lisp would have been better left out). His physical comedic antics alone often steal the show.
As with the acting, the plot was neither here nor there. The central romance between Henry and Lucy is heartwarming and, for the most part, well done (though not entirely realistic). But there were numerous irrelevant asides thrown in for cheap laughs. References to bodily fluids and male sexual organs are so frequent as to become tedious. It is also choc full of stereotypes regarding Hawaiians and others. What I did like, however, was the non-contrived ending. Once would expect a magical fairy-tale conclusion where Lucy suddenly recovers and they all live happily ever after, but this does not happen. While the ending is not really believable when one thinks in terms of the real world, neither is it cliched, and I liked this.
So overall I'm rather stuck in the middle on this one. If you're a big fan of Sandler's cruder side, you'll get some of that, but the romantic part may seem sappy to you. If you prefer a more sensitive romantic comedy, you'll get elements of that as well, but you may find parts of the movie vulgar and distasteful. The movie wasn't horrible, but neither was it perfect. However, though I won't be purchasing it for my own collection, it is worth seeing and I'd recommend renting it when it comes out on DVD and video.",1078617600,4,3137,4.865420560747664
5469254,4,B00AQ5U234,"As a previous poster had mentioned, I too am on the fence about Adam Sandler. For every fun movie (Wedding Singer) there was an equally unfunny movie(Little Nicky). I'm glad to see him back in fine form in this selection.
I mention that Sandler rewards his fans, it also seems to me that Sandler has to be one of the most loyal friends. In nearly every movie you will see reoccuring bit actors; from Allen Covert, Rob Schneider, Blake Clark and Peter Dante. There was also an homage to friend Chris Farley and the movie ""Tommy Boy"". If you notice carefully Lucy goes to the Callahan Institute funded by Callahan Motors in Sandusky, Ohio. For a fan of ""Tommy Boy"" this was a rare treat.
The slapstick was toned down in favor of sincerity without being schmaltzy. The chemistry between Barrymore and Sandler that worked in ""Wedding Singer"" definitely works again. The ending will leave you oddly touched. Kudos on the soundtrack as well.",1078531200,2,935,4.7073170731707314
5469255,3,B00AQ5U234,"When the humor of Adam Sandler works, it's a mildly pleasing variety, but when it fails, boy does it fall splat on its face. 50 First Dates, sadly, would belong squarely into the latter category if not saved occasionally by the bustling Barrymore.
The theme is based on a doozy and marginally original romantic premise -- a marine biologist (Sandler) in Hawaii has to give up his casanova ways when he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Barrymore) suffering an extreme syndrome of short-term memory loss.
Somewhere in its heart, the movie wants to be a touching and structurally innovative love story -- something on the order of ""Memento"" meets ""Groundhog Day"" meets ""Titanic.""
But the writing and screenplay are nowhere near spiffy enough to get this thing going and the stars don't have the substance to seduce us into accepting its premise as anything more than an overlong and never-very-funny ""Saturday Night Live!"" sketch.
And whatever credibility the movie achieves as a whimsical romance is regularly smothered by the usual barrage of Sandler-movie jokes about important matters like vomit, bathroom, genitalia, etc.
Recommended rental when the DVD makes its rounds, if you are a diehard Sandler or Barrymore fan. Little else to say about this forgettable fare.",1078444800,12,1279,5.095238095238095
5469256,3,B00AQ5U234,"Adam Sandler movies are hit and miss, though lately I've been much more impressed with his choices!  I really enjoyed Punch Drunk Love and since I loved the Wedding Singer, I decided to give 50 First Dates a shot.  It was better than I was expecting after reading so many horrible reviews on Rotton Tomatoes, but not nearly as good as some of his other movies.
The basic storyline is Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a vet for marine animals in Hawaii who tends to woo tourists so that he never has to settle down.  He dreams of taking his boat to Alaska to study walruses and one day while taking his boat for a 'test drive' it breaks down and he gets stuck on another part of the island waiting for someone to come tow it.  He stops in a diner where he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore).  He really likes her and they make plans to meet again the next day.  The next day she has no clue who he is, and that's when he finds out that she suffered brain damage in an accident a year before and has no short term memory.  Every night when she goes to sleep, it erases everything that happened that day.  Every morning she wakes up thinking it's the exact same day.
I love the chemistry beween Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, the two of them are fun to watch together.  Once they met and started romancing, the movie got much better.  The scenes that were unbearably bad were some with the supporting actors, especially the absolutely terrible character, Alexa I think was her name, that was Henry's assistant at work (the horrible mannish looking woman with braids).  The scenes with her were just awful and I would probably have given this movie another star if not for that.
A couple side characters that were really funny were Rob Schneider as Ula, who was funny - though his five kids really stole the show.  Also, Sean Astin (Samwise in Lord of the Rings) had a part as Lucy's steroid-using brother with a lisp and he was pretty funny as well.  Dan Aykroyd played Lucy's doctor and though his part was small, he had some of the funniest lines in the movie!
Overall, I thought it was a funny movie.  I especially like the ending, since I was expecting a cop-out Hollywood ending and didn't get it. ;) Despite some really bad scenes in the beginning, the movie turns around and becomes a heart-warming love story between Henry and Lucy which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I do recommend seeing it, but I definitely think the Wedding Singer is by far a superior movie with the same lead actors. :)",1078444800,4,2483,4.426373626373627

Each day Sandler's character woos Barrymore's character with surprisingly amusing stunts like pretending to be a kidnap victim so Barrymore's character will pull off to the side of the road and help him out...the jokes are vintage SNL.  But the heart of the movie is the love story between Sandler's and Barrymore's characters that is reminiscent of a casefile from neuropsychologist Oliver Sachs.  Sachs writes about true stories of people with severe brain damage who exhibit bizarre symptoms...such as the man who mistook his wife for a hat...which is also the title of one of his books.  The supporting cast, consisting of Sandler's SNL buddy Rob Schneider as well as Barrymore's character's father and brother, are immensely amusing.  Overall, the movie is certainly worth the seven or eight bucks to get into the theatre...especially if you go with friends...that way you can laugh together.",1078185600,3,1135,5.042780748663102

Along comes Sandler's character a womanizer who falls in love with Barrymore despite obvious obstacles to their romance.
I am not the typical movie viewer that watches many romantic comedies. However I did enjoy the wedding singer and was pleased the chemistry and as importantly comedic timing between Sandler and Barrymore was present in a second movie.
The supporting characters add humour to an otherwise morose and depressing premise. The movie deftly massages the heart strings, but when the viewer worries it is going to be really heart-wrenching Rob Schneider or another ""bit-player"" bails the script out, I attribute this largely to good screen-writing but also to the actors involved. This movie really is the cliched romantic comedy that is funny and heart-warming. 50 First Dates is almost enjoyable despite itself teehee, and a great date movie obviously.",1077667200,2,1112,5.115384615384615

5469264,4,B00AQ5U234,"You know those movies where you see the trailer in the theater and then when you see the actual movie you discover all the good parts were in the trailer?  Well, ""50 First Dates"" is not one of those movies.  In fact, I can make the argument that while the trailer may indeed have most of the funniest moments in this film, it most decidedly does not have any of the best moments of the film.  When you see the trailer about this movie in which Adam Sandler has to make a first impression on Drew Barrymore every day because she has no short term memory and wakes up every morning forgetting what happened the previous day, you would think that he discovers this the next morning when she wakes up in bed with a stranger and starts screaming.  However, I am happy to report, ""50 First Dates"" is not that movie either.

I have been trying to think of last time a movie prompted tears in my eyes as often as ""50 First Dates.""  We know that Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) no longer has any short term memory because of a car accident, but what we learn before we meet Lucy is that Henry Roth (Sandler) is apparently the king of the love 'em and leave 'em of the Hawaiian islands.  Thus the great irony is that he falls for the one woman who can forget him faster and more completely than any tourist he has ever dumped.  What we also learn about are the extraordinary lengths to which Lucy's family and friends go make each day the same happy day for her.  Lucy's brother Doug (Sean Astin) needs to lay off the steroids but her father (Blake Clark) is fiercely and lovingly protective of his daughter.  Watching everything that he and his son do each night to reset the stage for Lucy's happy day got me big time.

Unlike ""Groundhog Day,"" which only had a few minor flaws in logic (e.g., why does the music teacher claim Bill Murray as a student at the end?) there are giant holes in ""50 First Dates"" (e.g., how do the three guys manage to every day free to take care of Lucy?), but I do not care.  The gaps are covered in just too many sweet and touching moments for me to object to George Wing's screenplay.  The reason why I did not give ""50 First Dates"" is mainly because of the character of Ula (Rob Schneider), who represents the traditional ""Adam Sandler"" type of comedy in this film.  There are a few moments where Sandler goes over the top (basically anytime his voice gets to the yelling level), but I could forgive most of those (the last song he sings redeems much), but every time Ula showed up it was like clips from another movie.  The last time he shows up in the film I was really not happy to see him there because he was ruining a moment I had been eagerly awaiting.

One of the impressive things about this movie is that it does not cop out.  Dr. Keats (Dan Aykroyd), Lucy's doctor, tells us repeatedly that Lucy is never going to get better and a lot of the power of this movie comes from the different ways in which Lucy and Howard deal with this hard reality.  We also learn that for Lucy and his family there are what her dad calls ""bad"" days, and it because of them that Henry is inspired to try something different and provide another series of sweet moments in the film.  As long as he refrains from going into overdrive, Sandler makes it totally believable that Henry would spend every day trying to get Lucy to fall in love with him.  But it is Barrymore who is pitch perfect on both the comedy and the pathos of her role as Lucy.  If Sandler did not know that he had found his perfect leading lady after ""The Wedding Singer,"" then this film should do the trick.

The tagline for this film is ""Imagine having to win over the girl of your dreams... every friggin' day"" is a funny line, but it is as much misdirection as the trailer.  Henry may treat his strange assistant Alexa (Lusia Strus) badly, but he could not possibly be more patient with Lucy.  Even her skeptical father has to admit that he and Henry are kindred spirits.  Because this is Adam Sandler we keep waiting for him to try and take advantage of the situation, but, to repeat myself, this is not that film.  Yes, ""Groundhog Day"" is the better movie, but ""50 First Dates"" is also full of grace and more importantly the film finds of way of delivering on its promise.  First kisses might be the sweetest of all, but in this film it is the last date that makes you surrender on the off chance you manage to hold off that long.",1077408000,59,4410,4.301088270858525

5469266,2,B00AQ5U234,"Not being a fan of Adam Sandler, I may sound bit bias here but I thought this film really missed its mark completely. The basic concept was rip-off from Bill Murray's fantastic Groundhog Day but unlike that movie where the plot and characters evolved, in First 50 Dates, nothing changes. The characters remains as they were and things become pretty redundant by the half way point.
On a positive side, I thought Drew Barrymore was fantastic and her effort made my wallet felt better as the movie rolled along. Rob Schnieder and the animals at Sea Life Park were far more funnier then Sandler himself who I think was actually trying to act seriously for brief moment or two. I think even Sandler might have been miscast, not for a moment, did I thought he was the Casanova of the Islands as the begining of the movie was trying to tell us.
Romantic fantasy at its worst, nothing on the screen was really real or remotely close to being believable. None of the lead characters can pass for a local (outside of Schneider) in Hawaii, they need more tan I think. It was mildly entertaining and worst part is for all those out there who have seen the trailer for this movie....you have just seen almost all the funniest scenes of the movie already!!!",1077321600,3,1244,4.558035714285714

Many men find special things to do for the one they love like buy them flowers, candy, or jewelry, while others take them out for a night on the town complete with dinner and ... an Adam Sandler comedy? Yeah, it's true, Adam Sandler is releasing his new comedy out on Valentine's Day in an effort to save all adolescent males from being dragged to another Kate Hudson/Julia Roberts/Reese Witherspoon lackluster romantic comedy ... Okay, he's not doing it for those exact reasons but you get the idea.  But some movie-goers might be asking, when seeing the trailer for 50 First Dates, ""Haven't we seen this before?"" Yes, Sandler's new romantic comedy is being released on the exact same day as The Wedding Singer was five years ago, complete with Drew Barrymore as his love interest ... Is Sandler in a desperate effort for the good days that film sparked? Possibly, especially after moderate hits like Mr. Deeds and Anger Management and flat-out flops such as Little Nicky and Eight Crazy Nights. Could it be that the movie-going public is getting the same romantic comedy, only repackaged? Maybe Sander is becoming too commercial but only box office numbers will tell.
The story follows a young man who falls in love with a beautiful woman who can never truly love him back thanks to her short-term memory loss. Henry Roth is the ultimate stereotypical ladies' man who woos young women tourists, shows them a good time, but dumps them soon after the have sex. The problem is that Henry has a serious problem with commitment, especially after his college sweetheart dumped for a guidance counselor, and that is why he can never fall in love with a native Hawaiian girl but that all changes when he meets Lucy. He meets her in small restaurant and they seem to hit it off right away but when Henry meets the next day at the same restaurant, she doesn't remember him at all. He learns from one of her friends that Lucy was involved in a car accident a year ago and lost her short-term memory from that point on. Lucy's father and brother try and protect her from men who know of her condition and are just looking for a one night stand but Henry is adamantly determined to make her remember him, no matter it takes. The story for 50 First Dates is ... well, you don't know what it is, really. It feels like a combination of Groundhog's Day, The Wedding Singer, and Joe Versus the Volcano, all packed into one film but leaving nothing but mixed reactions. It's hard to tell what the filmmakers really wanted from this film as if they couldn't decided whether they wanted an emotional drama or romantic comedy and, in the end, they just decided to splice the two genres together and make whatever it came out to be.
The two leading stars of The Wedding Singer are back in this new film but the question is whether or not they still have the same on-screen chemistry they had five years ago. And the answer would be, yes, but separately, they are on different ends of the spectrum. Adam Sandler, who started his movie career off with such wacked-out comedies as Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, seems to have matured greatly since his early years as a comedian and has expressed some interesting acting talent on-screen. How is 50 First Dates different for him? For one, he isn't blowing up with anger like all his other films and, second, he continues his level of serious performances in comedies like in Big Daddy. It seems his dramatic performance in Paul Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love did him some real good, which he shows off in the more emotional aspects of the feature. Drew Barrymore, best known for her role in Steven Spielberg's E.T., has really grown up since her early roles but hasn't improved much in the area of her performances. Granted she demonstrates real chemistry with Sandler, but alone she doesn't give anything better then her lower-browed romantic comedy roles like in Riding in Cars with Boys or Never Been Kissed. And, whether this was intentional or not, Barrymore manages to slut up an emotional good-bye between her and Sandler in the rain by not wearing a bra and bearing her soaked breasts, even if only for a few seconds. Not trying to hark back to the Super Bowl, but this shows a serious level of immaturity, if intentionally placed.
Overall, true romantics will find this predictable premise delightful while others will be wishing they had short-term memory loss. The biggest problem for the film is its lack of consistency, in that there is no balance between its heart-warming emotional sequences and its, at times, gut-wrenching comedic moments. While on the subject, were scenes like the barfing walrus or the butt flecking from Sean Austin (never thought you ever hear that, right?) absolutely necessary? Not to say it was all gross-out humor, 50 First Dates manages to actually pack in a relatively decent amount of hilarious highlights that weren't featured in the film's trailer, unlike Sandler's last film, Anger Management. Note, though, the use of the word `decent' as several comedic scenes went off without even the slightest giggle. And though the film comes in at a not-too-bad one hour and thirty-six minutes, the repetitive story elements makes it feel at least thirty minutes longer then it actually is. If you are neither a fan of romantic comedies or Adam Sandler, save yourself the sixteen bucks (along with an additional fifteen for snacks) and take your girl to a play or a musical or something more entertaining then this.",1077148800,6,5504,4.751306165099269

Adam plays Henry, a guy unable to commit with any woman, who lives by his own personal philosophy to not date any local girls because that means attachment. Then along comes Lucy. He's literally ""blinded by the light"" when he first sees her, and you know that after a nice long conversation about fish smells and waffle houses that Henry has met his match.

One of my initial concerns was that there would be no possible way to end this movie gracefully, let alone in a way that would please the audience. The ending is magnificent for what the movie is, and the audience will certainly be pleased.
Adam has certainly found his niche. While his other films offer a whacked out Sandler, this one offers us a sweet and adorable guy that girls are sure to gush over, even with his egg shaped head. I know I did!

5469275,5,B00AQ5U234,"Adam Sandler is known for his laugh out loud gross humor, like in his recent films ""Mr. Deeds"" and ""Anger Manangement."" He always seems to play the same type of characters like in those movies as well. They are usually shot by the critics. Even in ""Punch Drunk Love"" he plays the character, but that was hailed by critics. But then there is ""50 First Dates"" where he and actress Drew Barrymoore reunite, except it is not your usual Adam Sandler. Normally he is a good natured man, who has a hidden violent temper. But in this movie he shows the sweet side of him. It was a nice change, even though all of his past movies are still great. Sander and Barrymoore first acted together in ""The Wedding Singer"" and worked well off of each other in that, and in this. Two very talented celebrities working well equals a great movie.
Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, the kind of guy who likes who go out with a women one day, and then leave them the next day. He works with animals, and likes to hang out with his friend Ula. He doesn't want to settle down with a women, because he has a job to travel to the artic and study the walrus. But in a diner run by Sue and the cook Nick, he meets Lucy Whitmore a beautiful blonde women who spends a mourning with Henry, causing him to fall in love. The plan to have breakfast the next mourning, but when he shows up, she has no idea who he is. Sue tells Henry that she was in a car accident about a year ago, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She remember everythings that happened before the car crash. So everyday she thinks that it is the day of her accident, causing her to do the same thing every single day. With her docotr, Dr. Keats, knowing that there is nothing to cure Lucy, everyday is the same, only she doesn't know that. Her father Martin, and her brother Doug, also go to the extremes to make everything the same each day, except when they find out about Henry's intentions, they become nervous that he will ruin everything that they do everyday. But everyday, Henry falls deeper and deeper into love with Lucy, except that she has no idea who he is 24 hours later. From that point on, he goes to the extremes to try and remind her who he is every single day.
""50 First Dates"" has a very funny idea, and the entire film works. There is not even any gross humor, except for the beginning when a walrus vomits on another person. Alot of the comedy comes from Ula, played by comedian Rob Schneider, who has five children, all of them smarter then he is. I liked everything about this movie, except I liked ""Anger Manangement"" better. This was a comedy, with small dabs of drama added in, except it's needed. It sounds like something that the Farrelly Brother's would do, but its not. It's is a classic Adam Sandler film.

Summary:
A good funny hit... especially since Sandler has toned down his slapstick a bit for more mature comedy.
When Adam Sandler first hit the big screen, I really tried to avoid him.  But, as he developed his acting skills a bit, he seems more tolerable, and even enjoyable. The plot and fun script carry things forward, and Sandler and Barrymore develop a good chemistry together.... in fact Barrymore tends to really carry the movie.
Story:
Sandler plays a marine biologist in Hawaii who falls in love Barrymore suffering from short term memory loss due to an accident.  Every morning is a new day to her while Sandler gets to know her very well, and tries every dumb idea to help her remember him.
Recommendation:
Go for it if you like playful scripts without much meaning.",1076803200,4,787,4.695652173913044
5469277,3,B00AQ5U234,"Across the US, attractive young women are returning from their Hawaiian vacations with the same general idea - they met a great guy named Henry Roth.  He was mysterious, fun, but always what they wanted.  But he would always have to disappear when the vacation was over.  It turns out that Roth is really Adam Sandler - or Sandler is Roth - a vet at a Hawaiian aquarium who fears commitment with any woman, but is not averse having a week of fun.  Roth is a fun and loveable knucklehead - in other words, he really is Adam Sandler.  Unlike the knucklehead of the ""Wedding Singer"" (which this flick resembles because Sandler turns up the charm, and also because Drew Barrymore is back) Roth fears being tied down (in WS, he dreamt of nothing more than finding the perfect woman for the perfect song).  A committed vet, Roth plans on an extended voyage to study walruses in the north Pacific - plans that have no room for girlfriends or (gulp) a wife!  Plans change when he meets the lovely Lucy (Barrymore) on a chance encounter in a caf.  At first they hit it off, and Lucy becomes his dream girl.  Then the dream turns dark, and Roth learns that he has to keep hitting it off with her.  Seems that Lucy was involved in a car accident which totaled her ability to convert short term memory into long-term memory.  Thus, every day for Lucy starts off as a repeat of the day of the accident.  While the world passes her by, Lucy blissfully relives an idle Sunday in the idyllic Hawaiian paradise.  Worming his way past a circle of friends determined to shield Lucy, Roth finds that even succeeding at love with Lucy has its challenges (especially when, ala ""Groundhogs Day"" she forgets yesterday's tenderness).  Will Roth persevere?  Will he somehow find a way to unlock Lucy's heart despite a condition considered incurable.  More to the point, will how much fun can a flick have with catastrophic and irreversible brain damage?
""Dates"" excels improbably.  It's a lot of fun, yet tender and yet (biggest surprise) actually brings out the pathos of Barrymore's condition.  It's not a laugh-riot that will split your sides as one where you'll always have a laugh.  Mostly, ""Dates"" excels because Sandler is democratic enough to parcel out the jokes - to Rob Schneider as an amiable crackpot who hangs out at the aquarium; Sean Astin as Barrymore's steroid-addled brother; to various characters who populate the dreamy Hawaiian landscape and to the animal characters who get most of Roth's lavish attention.",1076803200,3,2503,4.725806451612903
5469278,3,B00AQ5U234,"This review is not going to say anything that hasn't been said about Adam Sandler movies before, but I believe this is fitting, seeing as Sandler hasn't given us anything new since Billy Madison.  Don't get me wrong, this movie has its funny moments, coupled by a really, really cute love story that will lead to some ridiculous conflict, which is eventually resolved and where upon Sandler ends up with the woman of his dreams.  Of course, this sums up just about every Sandler movie out there, but I did think that the ""Memento"" twist in the story was kind of interesting.  So, I won't say this is a bad movie, because it's not, but you could get the same story from any of Sandler's movies.  I realize that this review is pointless, but I'm bored and feel like criticizing something... viva la internet.",1076803200,3,806,4.576388888888889
5469279,5,B00AQ5U234,"i watched this movie with my girlfriend and i TOTALLY loved it.  although that might just be cuz i was with her....anyway...it was a really good movie.  it took me from laughing my face off at the comedy to the verge of tears at the sappiness...some may call this a chick flick.  thats ok with me.  i have no problem with chick flicks...i think they're a vital part of the film industry.  (ok i don't know where that just came from...)  if you're looking for a movie to see with that special someone, i recommend this one.",1076803200,3,522,4.329896907216495
5469280,4,B00AQ5U234,"I really enjoyed this show! Adam Sandler (Henry Roth) and Drew Barrymore (Lucy Whitmore) do a great job, on par with the Wedding Singer. If you enjoyed that movie you will enjoy this one as well.
This is a story about a womanizer who gives up the swinger life when he finds his true love; the only problem is, is that she has no short-term memory and cannot remember him the next day. The rest of the movie is about Henry trying to build a relationship each new day. Although this may sound corny, I fell for it! I took my wife to this one for Valentines Day and we both laughed hard and enjoyed the entertaining imagination of Adam Sandler. There are some very funny parts to this movie and the story line is interesting as well.
The only note of caution is the gross jokes of Rob Schneider and whoever plays the German girl/ guy. Their jokes were not only crass, but also forced and unfunny. I recommend this to anyone (who is an Adam Sandler fan) who is looking for a good romantic comedy.",1076716800,4,992,4.310160427807487
