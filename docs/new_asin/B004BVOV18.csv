4320622,3,B004BVOV18,"gruffy and fluffy, trying to elude snuffy, and his gang of outlaws, run around vegas.....sometimes they use a ford truck.......fighting, swearing, and an unmistakable open vein of religion combine to make this a movie unlike the one you saw last week.
Should you see it ? why not !!  gruffy is fluffy, and fluffy is gruffy, and in the end all is revealed as you hoped it would be.
But remember, it's better if all that happens in vegas stays in vegas.
Ten years from now, this is the only vegas movie you will want to remember.  But then you're a dummie......",1292198400,,559,4.470588235294118
4320623,5,B004BVOV18,"Keith, See you on the Red Carpet!!! I would love to contribute Funds towards your next Movie..I received my four copies, but Im ordering more now as x-mas gifts. Word of mouth right!. And thank you for your letter. NICE. I live in Vegas also, my Mailman doesn't look anything like you, heehee.  From a Huge fan, Carol Woolf",1291680000,,323,4.47457627118644
4320624,5,B004BVOV18,"When I first sat down to watch this movie, I had no idea what to expect but the cinematography is brilliant and sets each scene. With a budget of less than $3,000.00, I can't beleive it at all. The fight scenes are great. It's not what you expect - it doesn't look 'low budget' but rather something you would see in a 'regular' movie. The comic book flare is great and definitely adds an artistic knotch to the film. If I can sum it up in a phrase, think Pulp Fiction meets Sin City. The dark comic notes of this film are great - you don't want to miss it because it's completely worth it!",1291075200,,589,4.130434782608695
4320625,5,B004BVOV18,"I wasn't sure what to expect from One Long Day, considering it is a low budget movie with unknowns.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film and want to say that Keith Mosher has a tremendous talent here!  The actors involved (and everyone else associated, don't want to leave anyone out as it is always a team effort) also were great.

The movie starts out by showing scenes of Gruff and the love of his life, his little dachshund Fluffy.  This may sound rather Disney like.  Let me tell you, this is no Disney movie!  What draws you immediately is how funny this actually is because Gruff is a tall muscular macho type, not exactly the kind who would own a wiener dog!

The next movie scene begins in the early morning, the start of one very long day.  Two guys (who will have you in stitches!) belong to the mob and are out to give a warning to someone who has wronged the mob boss.  They end up going to the wrong address, which turns out to be Gruff's house.  They beat Gruff and end up killing Fluffy.  As an animal lover I wasn't sure I wanted to see this part but you don't actually see them kill her and it ended up being incredibly funny!

I won't divulge the entire plot of the movie, only that Gruff goes on a rampage seeking revenge against the guys who killed his dog.  Chris Schaub does an excellent job playing Gruff and makes you think of the Terminator in that he doesn't stop going after the bad guys.  Action galore, fast cars, comedy and I loved how the ending had such a neat twist that you'd never expect.  Ladies, buy this for the men in your life!  They will love the action scenes and you both will love the comedy.  Beware that there are a lot (and I do mean a lot!) of ""F bombs"" in it so it's not a movie for the kids.  I wish they had not overused that word quite so much.  But it is still a very funny action film that is well worth the $20 they are asking for it.  There are also bloopers on the dvd that are fun to watch as well.

I hope Keith Mosher goes on to make more movies as I found this to be far better than many of the big budget movies out there in theaters now.  This film deserves to win some awards at film festivals and get some notoriety.  It could become a cult classic!",1290556800,,2234,4.12037037037037
4320626,5,B004BVOV18,"One Long Day is a movie destined to become a Cult Classic.  Think ""A Clockwork Orange"" meets ""Good Fellas"" and you have a sense of just how this movie will appeal to the masses.  Director Keith Mosher has brought together an ensemble cast, weaving an intriguing story together in this epic Action/Comedy film.  I envision audience viewers strapping on their Bicycle Safety Helmets, tethering their S&M ball gags around their mouths and arming themselves with frying pans while watching this movie.  This film is a riotously funny and raucous romp through Mr. Mosher's mind.  Prepare yourselves for a real treat and you too will have...One Long Day!  Highly recommended!!

4320627,4,B004BVOV18,"Its a non-stop thrill ride from the beginning... Car Explosions, gun fights, fist fights, Nice special effects as well... Good soundtrack... Well Rounded Film.. Cant wait until Mosher's 2nd Film..",1290297600,2,196,5.566666666666666
4320628,5,B004BVOV18,"We just received our copy of this movie and it was fantastic!!!! It was non stop action from start to finish with an incredible cast of characters. Who could not love a story about a man and his dog and what happens when everything goes wrong. Chris was excellent in the role of Gruff and the series of odd and bizarre events that ocurrs in one day of his life.

This was a great first effort for Keith Mosher and I can hardly wait for his next film debut. Keep up the great work and hopefully we will soon see this movie nominated for The Sundance Film Awards in Utah.",1290038400,3,569,4.172727272727273
4320629,5,B004BVOV18,"This movie is an absolute must have for any fan of dark comedy and gritty action movies. Following in the vein of cult classics such as The Big Lebowski, this movie chronicles the story of one man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and the longest day ever that follows as he gets his revenge on the people who wronged him and his best friend Fluffy. It was shot entirely in Vegas and the entire soundtrack was recorded by local up and coming artists. This movie is well worth the price, I will happily watch it again and again. At times dark and gritty, and at other times downright hilarious, this movie is a must have for any cult classic movie lover. Please spread the word about this amazing movie, Im personally hoping it makes it to the Sundance movie festival!",1290038400,3,778,4.372413793103449

8422412,5,B004BVOV18,"Gruffy, and Fluffy, all distraught about Muffy, roam the desert, not too far from Las Vegas, seeking violent revenge and cursing up a storm.....bald guys, guns, blood, fights to the death of the evil doers, and almost no beautiful women, or prohibited sex, combine to show you why what's shot in Vegas should stay in Vegas......But, too late, it is out in universal release, and features, among four other wonders, a young genius support staffer, called here ""Scot,"" who does make-up and provides props, so real you would think they are from ""carrie,"" or ""the exorcist,"" and yet, no, no, no, they are from the spirit of Muffy, who is executive producer.

This flick deserves distribution in every corner controlled by The Empire..I predict it will be, and very soon.",1386115200,,766,4.892307692307693
8422413,2,B004BVOV18,Standard story line with a little original humor. Heavy on goofy camera effects. Lighter on acting. Stunts were third rate. Not horrible but production values were not worthy of much praise.,1376697600,,190,5.161290322580645
8422414,5,B004BVOV18,"This film is fantastic for being a low budget film. The directing,acting and fight scenes were incredible. This film won 2 awards in film festivals in California and Nevada. I look forward to the sequel.",1371427200,,203,4.828571428571428

I found the casting spot on! Poor Fluffy!!! Be sure to see this Guy flick!!!!",1311206400,,155,3.727272727272727
8422416,5,B004BVOV18,"After watching for a 3rd time I was surprised and got to see pretty much all of this films nuances!

There were major and minor ones that I missed before that make a unique difference.

For a film made under $3K it was well done.

From one shot to the next it was all woven together giving a nice flow.

The soundtrack and timing really fit the action sequences too!

And for the writer(s) what an uncommon story!!!

The Director and crew really put some time and care into its shots sfx and editing.

The actors did a great job too!!! I have it my collection now!",1310688000,,564,4.214953271028038
8422417,5,B004BVOV18,"WOW!  Action Packed! Extremely well acted , filmed and directed! Funny at times, yet gruesome too! A Cult Classic for sure! I would recommend this film to my friends and to everyone who wants to witness genius being born in director Keith Mosher!",1310342400,,246,4.72093023255814
8422418,5,B004BVOV18,"One Long Day is a well written story that follows Gruff through a very long day (hence the title). Not to give too much away, but Gruff is the victim of mistaken identity where the mob shows up to collect money and kills his dog. It is an amazing journey as we follow Gruff in his quest for vengeance. This movie has it all.....classic cars, chases, shootings, and even S&M and blood! The influences I found in the film went from 24, Pulp Fiction, to a healthy nod to the Toxic Avenger (as Gruff deals with his grief). The actors do a superb job.  I didn't even notice that this was a ""ultra-low budget film"" through most of the movie. The production is top notch and the soundtrack fit the film. Don't take my word for it, buy the movie and experience it yourself!",1301356800,,765,4.3125
8422419,3,B004BVOV18,"Pretty good action movie,Very good low budget movie,too think all of what you'll see happen in one day, some unbelievalbe stuff, but good entertainment",1296259200,,151,5.333333333333333
8422420,4,B004BVOV18,"I gotta say, the movie is way better than I expected. It has a great B movie sensibility but is actually shot and directed really well. Ostensibly the story is ""The mob crossed the wrong guy and now they're getting some payback"" but it tells that story with a good sense of humor and never takes itself too seriously. The first 5 minutes lets you know what to expect and puts you on notice that you're in for some great, popcorn chowing fun. I'd be lying if I didn't like it at least a little bit because of the fact that it is a 100% born and bred right here in Las Vegas, my home town. Rarely do we see movies based in the less recognizable portions of Vegas that I see every day.

Look, the movie has strip clubs, bikers, the mob, a hit man, lots and lots of guns and beat downs. How can you go wrong? Get your friends, get a case of your favorite beer, have a movie night you'll all enjoy.",1292284800,,893,4.073863636363637
