8560096,5,B00B04NIQ8,A Great Package of information about President Lincoln along with a Surprising movie with Hal Holbrook and always loved this portrayal of President Lincoln and well done.,1525219200,,170,5.333333333333333
8560097,5,B00B04NIQ8,"This may not be the best chronicle of Mr. Lincoln ever made but it certainly deserves a place with the best.  The Hal Holbrook segment alone earns this collection that place.  Few people today would be willing or able to get themselves around Carl Sanders' marvelous work.  This treatment is certainly accessible to nearly everyone.  Except, of course, to those like the producer of the one star reviewer below.",1465516800,,411,4.913043478260869
8560098,5,B00B04NIQ8,"I love it!!! totally when they talk about the comon confederate/federal soldier. The confederate soldier is a friend of mine!
Kevin Hershenburger does it right! the best director. Best historical designer ect ect",1428364800,,212,5.454545454545454
8560099,5,B00B04NIQ8,"Purchased as a gift for a family member, and cannot wait to borrow.  Who wouldn't love Lincoln and enjoying this historical information.",1391904000,,136,5.181818181818182
8560100,4,B00B04NIQ8,"I find it absolutely appalling that anyone would give this box set only one star.  Granted, I haven't watched all of it yet, but just judging by what I have seen so far, the two full-length movies on Disk 10 (D. W. Griffith's ""Abraham Lincoln"" from 1930 in particular) and the Hal Holbrook miniseries(""Sandberg's Lincoln""), I would give this box set 4 stars, and probably 5, considering how accurately and beautifully Holbrook plays Honest Abe, and how well this six episodes miniseries is done. Look up ""Sandberg's Lincoln,"" (which is also sold by itself on Amazon) in the search box for reviews if you don't believe me. It just happens to also be included in this set and in no way does it deserve only one star.

As for the rest, it may not be good at all, but even if it is terrible, the mini-series and movie are worth more than $11 and I won't feel that I wasted a single penny by purchasing it.",1374364800,7,901,4.421686746987952
8560101,1,B00B04NIQ8,"Bought this DVD set for my wife, she is a big Civil War fan. She said the film quality was poor and the stories very boring, do not buy!",1368057600,2,136,3.7241379310344827
