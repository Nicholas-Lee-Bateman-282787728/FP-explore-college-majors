7820487,5,6302038480,This video really engages beginning Art History students because they can witness the restoration of the Sistine Chapel step by step from both detractors and promotors points of view.  The issue is whether the restoration is an improvement or a travesty.  Even those knew to art can put forth an educated opinion after viewing.  Nova should reissue this video.,1066694400,4,360,5.067796610169491
