Anyway, I love this video, not only for sentimental reasons. It IS hilarious. The plastic announcer (watch his look of frustration when he's not smiling), the fact that it's a freaking school assembly. The only boring part was about, like, making masters of albums or something.

Great bands. Some of their best songs are chosen (except Cut Your Hair. Maybe it was the only video Pavement made. Spoon, Railroad Jerk, the completely brilliant of the ""arena"" bank Chavez. Liz Phair's one word responses to questions is great. Helium, Yo La Tengo with, again, a funny video and a great track (they always reminded me of Sonic Youth, but better), Silkworm, yes. So, yep, I love this I'm running out of superlatives.

So, so great. An exciting era of the truly, truly independent artists of the 90s.

Oh, is there any way to get this on DVD. My VCR died 10 years ago.",1414195200,,1057,4.5473684210526315

7877715,2,6304725892,"You get some pretty all right videos on this Matador collection--though  the videos are nowhere near as good as the CD compilation.  The Liz Phair  video is very tongue-in-cheek, as is her ironic performance as a rock star  in the ""interview.""  There are some other fine music videos on  this tape, but nothing that really honors the medium or explores the  possibilities: these are pretty much cut and dry, low-budget music videos.  Unfortunately, the whole tape is interpersed with cutesy little segments  about Matador, which are rather boring.  You can always fast-forward, but  ultimately the humor segments and some weak videos collapse the value of  the whole tape and leave the viewer feeling uninspired.",968112000,,712,5.149122807017544
