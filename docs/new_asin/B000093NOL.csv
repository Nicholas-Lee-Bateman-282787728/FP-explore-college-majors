1877167,5,B000093NOL,"As I write this, Farscape is well into its 4th season. I have known about the existance of Farscape from its beginnings. However I never bothered to watch the show because it looked so weird. Knowing that ""muppets"" (I tease as the show is produced by Jim Henson Entertainment) played two of the characters didn't help. But with everything else in reruns and SciFi showing new episodes, I thought, ""What the heck."" So I watched an episode and was surprised at how quickly I was absorbed into the show despite knowing almost nothing about it. Five episodes later I can say I was hooked. Since then I've worked on watching all of the old episodes and buying the VHS tapes.
This is the 3rd box set of Farscape's first season. Three tapes come in this box-set and each tape contains 2 epidsodes. These are shown in order.
Tape 1: ""The Flax"" & ""Jeremiah Crichton"";
Tape 2: ""Durka Returns"" & ""A Human Reaction"" ;
Tape 3: ""Through the Looking Glass"" & ""A Bug's Life"".
What marks this set of tapes is the entrance of the character Chiana who would go on to become a regular cast memeber (""Durka Returns""). Also, the characters continue to grow and continuity begins to play out quite well.",1029542400,2,1180,4.570754716981132
1877168,5,B000093NOL,"Farscape keeps getting better and better, and this set, as a collection of episodes is no exception. This set has some of the most important early episodes for the relationships between the crew members, and even has restored scenes that clear up a few questions and vagunesses from the TV showings. Buy it. You'll love it. Go ahead-- give in to the 'Scaper inside...",1013212800,,367,4.75
1877169,5,B000093NOL,"I bought both Collections one and three at my local video store (at half price) but they were missing collection two which I've just bought here in Amazon. If you love sci fi these collections are some of the better sci fi shows to watch. My children are hook and I couldn't pass up getting the missing collection. I've enjoyed watching these shows almost as much as my children. If you can afford it, buy all three collections at once.

1877182,5,B000093NOL,"Loved this show back in 2000 when it first came out on SciFi network, even if some of the episodes are a bit cheesy and poorly written. Missed numerous episodes due to what seemed like flaky broadcast schedules (the show seemed to disappear from SciFi for weeks at a time and then would randomly reappear, and I missed season 3+ entirely). Gives me a chance to catch up with what I missed, and the show doesn't seem dated at all, despite being 15 years old now (hard to believe its been that long!)",1462406400,,498,4.365591397849462

1877272,4,B000093NOL,"I have to say the show had fantastic potential. It, sadly, reminded me of Blake 7. They have one common thread. They both face difficult odds with an evil government. They both have powerful ships and skills to undermine this government, but never work at improving their position or gain a base to establish allies to work towards creating, let us use the word...republic...for lack of a better one.
The acting is wonderful. The stories are entertaining. The back stories of each character makes seem very real to the viewer. All is well done, save they obviously do not believe they can be freedom fighters. The issues are only around survival, avoid being caught and for the protagonist (the lost astronaut from Earth) how to get back home to warn Earth about what really is out here! Or, should he even try? Perhaps if he successful, Earth won't believe him or one of more of the evil alien powers may follow him home!

Hence why I say it is like Blake 7.

I prefer a story in which the hero keeps the group together, has them realize they can defeat the ""evil empire"" and save his own people too. I have not seen a story like that since Flash Gordon or the like. All I note are sad stories in which are canceled by the network, or wrap up with all the hero's dying in the end.

So, why four stars? As I said above. Good stories, great acting. They deserve the stars. Poor plot and theme removed one star.

There was room 4 both shows- I have remained staunchly anti-sci-fi channel since. Farscape had good ratings and if sci-fi had supported it properly it could have been a bonafide hit--its well acted, good effects that hold up 10 years later.

Self-Inflicted Wounds, ...Different Destinations (started off crappy, but had a deep dark ending), Incubator, Scratch 'n sniff (funniest episode to me so far), and Dog with Two Bones were some of the most well written, layered stories of the whole series thus far.  The story arc of Crichton and Aeryn falling in love leading up to the Infinite Possibilities episodes was amazingly emotional and felt truly real, which made the season finale Dog with Two Bones that much more sentimental.  It is relieving as a fan, that after so many episodes, the show can still run strong and get better.  Season 3 is where you love a series, where it becomes one of your favorites almost to the point of nerdom.

My only complaint was the addition of Jool and Stark, such annoying characters.",1393027200,,823,4.767605633802817

On the down-side, the web link that's shown for the Fan Club in the ending credits is now owned by an actual ""Fan Manufacturer"", and leaves a true fan in the lurch...wish there were some way to get this rectified...

The puppetry and special effects are second to none, and I was deeply saddened when it was brought to an end.  I can't get enough of it, and I'm certain that other sci-fi afficionadoes will concur.

At the end of season four, I was compelled to buy ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"", and have absolutely no regrets!

Buffy, Angel, SG-1, and all others were written as if the writers were seeking a reason to guzzle another quart of Vodka or snort another gram of cocaine. I enjoyed the first two seasons of Farscape, but the third left me with a strong desire to cut myself and possibly thinking that maybe I should simply do away with my loved ones so that they wouldn't have to face the dark reality of life. I can understand and see the value of a little angst in a storyline, but to lay hour after hour onto the screen and still demonstrate a voracious hunger for more darkness is beyond me. I wanted a little of the fun of the first two seasons back. I see why they couldn't get the backing for a 5th season. It was just dark and dreadful for an audience. they may as well have shown traffic cam images of children being burned alive in car wrecks as to have continued the spiral into the depths of depression to which they built the story line. John should have just slit his wrists and saved earth rather than continue. All is hopeless and nothing matters. Let them die, just die.

Season 3 is when the big ball gets rolling and the larger story arc that eventually takes over in Season 4 and Peacekeeper War becomes startling apparent. Small, insignificant details turn out to be critical plot points later in the season, and emotional development is one of the most important things to happen in all the characters. Not to mention the bittersweet departure of Virginia Hey.

One of the best seasons for one of the best science fiction shows ever to be made. And it only gets better after this.",1381968000,,615,4.694444444444445
1877410,4,B000093NOL,This is a weird show and because its Australian it can feel even stranger.  I think the show is interesting as a view into a descent to madness.  The protagonist John Crichton starts the series as a diplomatic non-violent and anti-violence character yet by season 3 he's packin' heat and embracing violence but as he adopts violence throughout the series the character develops more and more unstable behaviours breaking down into manic states in the middle of chaotic violent situations.  Overall the show is very well made using Jim Henson puppets and limited use of CGI effects.  It really stands out in the sci-fi world.  The women are strong lead characters and create well portrayed non-objectified role models which are severely lacking in 90% of not just sci-fi but media as a whole.

Maybe it was just the same ongoing problems with it that finally got to me, but it just seemed like the show took steps backwards this season. The only consistent characters are John and Harvey (inside John's head, so he doesn't hardly count). The rest flipped into different modes depending on where they needed the story to go. One episode everyone is buddy buddy and working hard to make everyone else feel good about themselves. The next they're totally selfish and go out of their way to hurt each other. It's just so inconsistent and it leads to the viewer feeling no personal connection to the characters (because its really like different characters in the same body). On top of that, they took some of the good concepts of the show and drove them into the ground in all the wrong ways. A living ship....that's neat. But when 70% of the plots revolve around the characters having to do something for the ship because its alive, it gets a little old. It's like the writers thought ""Hmmm, we need a reason for them to not leave this planet. I guess we can make it because the ship doesn't want to? Or maybe because the ship is hurt and they don't want to risk hurting it more? Or how about the ship misses it's family? It's all just lazy writing. Good concepts behind it, but poorly executed. It bothers me because it could be so much more.",1374883200,,1500,4.399280575539568

There is ample evidence of poor technical support: noises heard in deep space; impractical protective clothing during extra-vehicular activities; nearly every alien species imbued with some kind of magical power; multiple resurrections from death, all of which shift the implied genre of science fiction to sheer fantasy. Or maybe the writers intended the show to be a satirical spoof. In spite of all that, I confess that I watched the entire series: presumptive evidence of either my poor taste or my adolescent mind.

I am a huge fan of them all, Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Doctor Who, Firefly, if you can name it I've seen it, and loved it.  Farscape surprised me by taking the genre in a new direction.  A ship with no weapons, that was alive, totally rad.  Characters that not only didn't get along, but in some cases, actively  hated each other.  The plot twists and turns were awe inspiring, as was the acting.  Long before BSG was using frak, Farscape had their own slang cuss words.  You can see, in some places, where shows like Firefly got there ideas, and or camera shots.  Farscape is totally underrated, and unheralded as far as I can tell, and you should do all you can to change that!!
Season three continues to be all that the first two seasons were, and more.  I think maybe the budget got bigger, because the space battle scenes, and planetary landscapes, as well as the Intro to the show all got better.  The tension between the Peace Keepers, and the Crew of Moya continues to escalate, and the addition of the Scarrans, really makes things boil!!

Secousu (sorry about the spelling), very hot.  Jool, made me drool, and of course Zahn, wow, what can I say.  Other than that, I thought that the character interplay was unique so I believe I watched the last episode/mini-movie about 10-times and decided I would find out more about this show that was made by son of a legend Jim Henson.  Brian Henson and his pals got together and allowed the actors to explore the characters and this is what resulted.
The bad guys and girls are totally vicious and malevolent.  The good guys pull out of the fire at the very last moments always and the show always has time to be sexy.  There are more push-up bras than at JC Penney's.  Aside from the obvious unlike Star Trek; you have a bunch of thieves, killers, ex-prisoners and maniacs on a living ship with a symbiotic pilot that becomes a target for every criminal in the galaxy.  Like I say a good mix of action, violence, good guy to the rescue with consequences and throw in a liberal amount of sexy and you have ""Not Your Mother's Star Trek!  Good stuff.

1877642,5,B000093NOL,"The third season of Farscape is easily my favorite out of the four seasons and one miniseries. Though it suffers the loss of a beloved original character whose absence is keenly felt throughout the rest of the show's run, it fires on all cylinders as it races through great episode after great episode, cutting out surplus filler and concentrating on tightly-written character arcs and storylines that culminate in one of the best season finales ever to air on television.

For the uninitiated, a brief run-down: ""Farscape"" is a quintessential space opera surrounding the exploits of a group of escaped prisoners and one lost American astronaut (our protagonist, John Crichton). Aboard a living ship called Moya, a sentient vessel who communicates with her passengers through an alien known as Pilot, and having recently given birth to a dangerous young warship named Talyn, the crew of fugitives flees from the military arm of the government known as Peacekeepers.

The crew of Moya (who include D'Argo, a warrior framed for the murder of his wife, Chiana, a vivacious thief, Zhaan, a mystical priestess, and Rygel, the dispossessed ruler of an empire) are able to keep one step ahead thanks to the presence of Aeryn Sun, an ex-officer who was exiled after being deemed contaminated by prolonged exposure to the escaped criminals.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Two/dp/B002GP7ZVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Two</a>&nbsp;ended with Aeryn's tragic death, but begins with her resurrection thanks to the efforts of Zhaan. This sacrifice however, will come with a hefty price.

John Crichton is still struggling with the presence of a neural chip in his head, one that manifests in the form of the hybrid Peacekeeper Scorpias (and which allows for some of the craziest scenes in the show, including animation sequences in which John imagines himself chased like something out of a Wile E. Coyote across outer space) who is desperate to get his hands on the information John possesses pertaining to wormhole technology. Along with renegade Peacekeeper Crais, who commands Moya's tempestuous son Talyn, the crew decides to take matters into their own hands to prevent wormholes from being used as weapons in an increasingly volatile galaxy.

There are other problems too. In the season's most innovative plotline, Crichton is divided into two identical copies of himself. Doesn't sound like anything you haven't seen a thousand times before I hear you say, but in this case, it's what the writers do with this development that sets ""Farscape"" apart from the usual science-fiction conventions. Forced to split up for their own survival, one Crichton finds himself on board Talyn with Crais, Aeryn, Rygel and Stark, whilst the other remains on Moya with D'Argo, Chiana and Jool. The next few episodes alternate between these two groups, with Aeryn and (one) Crichton finally admitting and consummating their feelings on board Talyn, whilst (the other) Crichton grapples with ongoing disasters aboard Moya.

When another tragedy strikes, confusion reigns as the ships reunite and Aeryn tries to sort out just which John she loved, and to whom her heart is owned. We also get some fascinating back-story on Scorpias as to his birth and upbringing, which explains who and what he is without excusing the terrible crimes he's committed, and (in a perfect parallel) learn more about Aeryn's parents and her childhood, brought to the fore when her mother is sent as part of a Peacekeeper retrieval squad.

It's not all perfect. Zhaan's absence is sorely felt, and despite their best efforts, the writers never truly manage to replace her. The consensus on Virginia Hey's departure was that it was due to the health problems she faced with the extensive makeup her character required. One cannot blame her for wanting out under such conditions, and she is given a heroic and poignant sendoff. The problems however, were in the writers' attempts to fill the void left in her wake. Along with strong characterization of her own, Zhaan provided spiritual guidance and medical care to the crew, roles that were divided between reoccurring character Stark and the newly introduced Jool, a young woman who was awakened from one of the cryogenic chambers found last season.

Though the writers were intelligent enough to realize that an audience would balk at anyone brought in to immediately replace Zhaan, they are a little too self-aware in making Jool antagonistic and obnoxious, to avoid the pit-falls of creating an instantly adored Mary Sue character. It was the writers' way of reassuring the audience that Jool wasn't *meant* to be a likeable addition, particularly since the crew of Moya find her just as irritating, but the situation is compounded by Jool not really being necessary at all. Though she gradually improves over time (the writers' intent was surely to ease the audience into accepting her presence), neither she nor Stark ever really fit in with the group dynamic. They are not particularly endearing characters, and perhaps it would have been wiser to simply forego both of them in favor of working with the ones they already had.

Still, in a show with this much scope it's inevitable that not everything will work, and for the most part the tour de force of the season as a whole more than makes up for a couple of missteps. Season three brings back past characters such as Furlow (an engineer played by Australian comedian Magda Szubanski), and newcomer Commandant Grayzer, (played by Rebecca Riggs) a frighteningly cool and detached Peacekeeper official who will have a bigger part to play in the forth season. The two-part season finale in particular is a gripping conclusion to the events that have taken place over the course of the season, combining action, suspense and sacrifice, and providing a fitting send-off to two main characters. The season concludes with a quiet, introspective episode that creates further tension between the core cast and a revelation that will have you scrambling for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Four/dp/B0002VGSBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Four</a>.

For my money, series three is the best season of ""Farscape,"" providing the perfect balance between one-shot stories and overarching plots, light-hearted comedy and grandiose drama, character development and shocking change. As the central season between the first half of the show and the final season and concluding mini-series, season three is the lynchpin upon which the entire ""Farscape"" story hangs.",1284681600,2,6618,5.337488015340364

Characters die and are reborn, the wormhole technology experiments are finally explained, a major character is twinned. If all of this sounds farfetched it is but oddly enough it works to keep the audience interested throughout. If there is a problem with Farscape its that its plotlines were too complex for thecasual viewer to pickup if any of the episodes had been missed.

1877657,5,B000093NOL,"So, why if i say better and better do I now all of a sudden hate the Sci-Fi channel, well because after wrapping up season 3 (probably the greatest single season of any show ever) I can not see how cost alone would possibly have this show cancelled. Obviously this show was not cheap to produce, but with knowledge of releases to DVD seasons (which by 2004 were becomming more and more popular) you would likely have movie deals, and advertisng rights on that alone could have made gobs of money. Well enough ranting let me tell you about sseson 3.
\
I earlier called this season the greatest, and let me explain why, the show at this point has built a tension between the characters (most notably John and Aeryn, this one is tangible, and at the end of season 2, John is mildly responsible  (at least in his head) for Aeryn's death. I am a guy and most of the times do not go for the overly romantic story arc's shows ride. But in Season 3, I am rooting for them, really pulling that somehow it will all work, and for a while it does...kinda. They have 2 John's not a cloned John, but literally 2, same thoughts backrounds, lives, feelings, and the sequences on board Talyn are some of the most emotionally gripping Television, movie, book, story, etc ever in history. Your heart is grabbed by them and then smashed and destroyed by the end. This season does more than tell a story, amd invite you for a ride. It grabs you from the first episode and pulls you on board Moya and Talyn.

So you think this season is just the John and Aeryn show, not even close. The stories behind Crais, Scorpious, the loss of a character, the addition of others. D'Argo, and Chiana. This season is mind numbingly good. I feel get a few people with financial backing to watch this season, and you could have had many more seasons, movies, and so on.

Maybe its a dream, and as we hear from another new character (not all dreams are realized) but there has to be a way. Funding from bake sales, collections from fans, studios, Henson, there has to be something to give us one more shot.

With a much darker tone, and the major arc that would shape the series until it's end taking shape, it is clear that this is sci-fi TV at it's best.  Crichton (Ben Browder) returns to his old self, while Aeryn's (Claudia Black) life hangs in the balance.  Scorpius' (Wayne Pygram) obsession with wormhole technology is revealed in it's entirity, while Dargo (Anthony Simcoe) and Chiana's (Gigi Edgely) relationship takes a turn for the worst when Chiana begins an affair with Dargo's son Jothee.  The third season of Farscape also the sacrifice of a character who has been here since the beginning, as well as the tragic losses of a few others while introducing new heroes and villains; culminating in a clone of Crichton and Aeryn consumating their relationship with tragic results.

All the major sharkjumping moments - from Zhaan's death to the Looney Toons episode to Aeryn's baby to that insane Season 4 wormhole garbage - happen either during, immediately after, or as a direct result of Self-Inflicted Wounds.

1877694,5,B000093NOL,"The third season of ""Farscape"" captures the show in its prime; the various story arcs developed here are better than anything that came before. The writing and character development is, for the most part, top notch. Season three features the unusual episode ""Revenging Angel"" where the bulk of the episode occurs in a Looney Tunes Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote type of cartoon with Crichton and D'Argo. ""Infinite Possibilities"" another two parter features one of the Ancients appearing in the form of John's dad. They unlock the secrets of wormhole technology in Crichton's mind to prevent the Scarrans from escaping with a dangerous new weapon.

The stand out episodes in my mind that signify this development is the two part """"Into the Lion's Den"" from the conclusion of the season. Crichton agrees in this episode to help Scorpious achieve his dream of wormhole technology. Scorpious plans on using it to develop a weapon of mass destruction that can be used against the Scarions. In return, Crichton and the crew of Moya will receive diplomatic immunity. Things sour very quickly when Crichton realizes what will become of this new found weapon.

Picture quality is pretty sharp throughout most of the discs. To answer one question--why isn't this in widescreen? Because it was shot in fullscreen format. It is, however, a high definition transfer. The usual extras are included such as commentary tracks, deleted scenes,interviews with the various actors and behind-the-scenes glimpses of props, the creation of various villains, etc. The only thing missing here is any extra discs or information.

Aeryn is evolving emotionally, and not as filled with rage as before.  Even Rygel shows more human qualities while still remaining the bastard we have grown to love.

Highlights include

The Season Of Death:  Aeryn is pulled from the land of the dead by Zhann, with dire consequences.  John is restored to his old self.

Suns and Lovers:  The ship lands on a merchant station to restock their supplies.  But the station is being targetted by a group of religious fanatics that believe it is on holy ground and must be destroyed, so the crew helps out rescuing people in the broken base.  Chian and Jothee make some bad choices.

Different Destinations:  The crew is somehow pulled back in time to a group of missionaries besieged by an overwhelming enemy.  They find that they can alter time, but want to return before they change things for the worse.

Eat Me:  They are in a pod and encounter a disaster, so they land on a seemingly deserted leviathon to make repairs.  The ship is full of strange inbred peacekeepers and an even stranger maniac.  A strange new character is introduced.

Thanks for Sharing:  Talyn is badly wounded and they are trying to find resources to help out on the planet, inhabated by sci fi goths.  But there is strange resistance, and they think there is a conspiracy against them.  Possibly by the same Peacekeeper squad that attacked Talyn.

Green Eyed Monster:  The crew was seperated, half on talyn and half on moya.  Talyn is swallowed by the biggest creature in the galaxy, a budong.

Relativity:  Talyn lands on a jungle planet to assist in healing.  Aeryns mother turns out to be charge of the squad to capture Talyn, and is deadly efficient.

Incubator:  Scorpius tries to show the clone of john created on the chip his reasons for hating the Scarrans and obsession with wormholes.  So we get to see his disturbing history.

1877696,5,B000093NOL,"Warning:  Spoilers galore!  Free roaming discussion of the season story arcs!

First, before proceeding to heap excessive amounts of praise on this extraordinary season, I have to express my extreme anger at the ongoing refusal of the owner's of the series copyright to make it available to the public at a reasonable or even affordable price.  I do not own this set on DVD and do not plan on doing so as long as they continue pricing it as such absurd levels.  I'll struggle along with my tapes for now.  I'm not angry only because their price means I can't afford it; I am angry because the price keeps a host of would-be fans from discovering this remarkable series.  There is simply no excuse for the way they have gone about the DVD releases for FARSCAPE.  I thoroughly encourage anyone who loves Sci-fi or quality TV to explore this series-I promise you will be delighted with it-but I also encourage everyone to avoid purchasing this set at this price.  As consumers we need to let the companies know that they have a responsibility to make their products available at a reasonable price.

Season One of FARSCAPE saw the debut of a new and superb Sci-Fi series.  Season Two saw a marvelous development of all of the main characters, increasingly complex relationships between them, and the expansion of the many story arcs.  But absolutely nothing in either Season One or Season Two prepared viewers for how extraordinary the show would become in Season Three.  This season is unquestionably one of the greatest seasons any series has enjoyed in the history of television, and is in my opinion the greatest season any Sci-fi show has ever enjoyed.  What makes the season so spectacular is that they take a huge number of extraordinary risks, and manage to pull all of them off.  To cover merely some of the highlights, how many shows will begin a season by raising one character from the dead, killing off one of the main characters for good, savagely end a romance between two of the principal characters, create a clone of the show's main character, have the other main character embark on a torrid love affair with one of the clones, kill that clone off, and then savage the potential romance she might have with the other clone?  Then, to make matters even more interesting, kill off two more major characters in the season finale while suddenly and inexplicably inserting a new character from nowhere?  Sound complex?  It is!  But complex can be great when you assemble a team of great writers, great producers, great designers, and great actors.  This was an exceptionally ambitious season, and the miracle was that their ambitions were all realized.

Season Two ended with the death of Aeryn Sun and the removal of the implant that Scorpius inserted into John Crichton's brain.  Towards the end of Season Two, John and Aeryn seemed finally to be moving towards the fulfilled romance for which they seemed destined.  In a way, the challenge facing the writers in regard to John and Aeryn reminds me of the famous Monty Python cheese shop sketch.  In that skit, John Cleese enters a cheese shop to buy some cheese.  As he asks for each kind of cheese, none of which the shop possesses, the shop owner tries to concoct a new excuse for why they do not have that particular kind.  The game is to continually invent new excuses for why they don't have any cheese.  Similarly, the writers over nearly four seasons had to create a host of reasons for why Aeryn Sun and John Crichton weren't a couple, all while creating an overwhelming desire in all the show's viewers that they end up with each other.  So, each season presents a series of hurdles for John and Aeryn to leap over, all while maintaining a high degree of interest in one another.  The first hurdle is, of course, Aeryn's death in Season Two, just after she has declared her love for John and at the hand's of John, though temporarily possessed by the personality of Scorpius via the implant.  Aeryn is saved by Zhan, which eventually leads to her own death a few episodes into the season.  I have read varying accounts of the reason why Virginia Hey left the show, though all agree that it was her decision.  The essence seems to be that she was tired of the physical demands that the role made on her.  She not only had to put on blue body make up that generated allergic reactions, but she had to wear contacts that bothered her eyes, and had to shave both her head and her eyebrows.  Zhan leaves the show after a double sacrifice, first saving Aeryn's life but leaving herself in a condition that will eventually lead to death and later in intervening in a situation that costs her life immediately.

Shortly after Zhan's death, our heroes encounter a villain who clones individuals to produce food for consumption, leading to our seeing both D'Argo's and Chianna's clones being killed, but John's survives, which sets off a chain of events that colors everything else that happens this season.  After a couple of episodes in which the two Johns make everyone feel exceedingly awkward with their presence, Moya's crew gets splits for several episodes, a few going with Crais on Talon, and the rest on Moya.  Most significantly, the two Johns are split, and Aeryn goes with one of them onto Talon.  Of course, this John and Aeryn finally allow themselves to fall passionately in love, and give it the fullest possible expression, to the extent of the two of them talking of staying together even if John can get back to earth.  Unfortunately, this John dies after extensive exposure to radioactive material, which leaves Aeryn devastated.  When she eventually returns, she finds it impossible to face the other John.  The situation is unprecedented in Sci-fi, in that the man that Aeryn loves has both died and is yet still alive.  It is an impossible situation emotionally, and one can both sympathize with her pain and agonize over John's heart break as he realizes that the woman he loves has given her heart to him, but not this particular ""him"" but the ""other"" him.  The season ends shockingly with an emotional confrontation between John and Aeryn, with their flipping a coin to determine whether she is going to stay on the ship or leave, her departure when the coin doesn't bounce John's way, and finally the shocking revelation that she is pregnant, presumably with the other John's child.  It could have been a terribly silly story arc, but instead it was handled magnificently.  In my opinion, it was one of the truly great seasons in the history of TV.  For my money, during the 2001-2002 television season-with apologies to BUFFY, ANGEL, 24, and ALIAS-it was the best show on TV.

There was much, much more to the season.  John's struggle with Scorpius reached epic proportions.  Crais, a villain in Season One and a grudging ally in Seasons Two and Three, dies along with Talon in a heroic death.  D'Argo and Chianna fall apart as lovers.  There are a host of spectacular single episodes.  All in all, it was a remarkable season.  By all means see it, but rent it, borrow it, watch it in rerun.  Just don't encourage the DVD industry by buying it at such absurd prices.",1095292800,23,7158,4.702247191011236
1877697,3,B000093NOL,"the show was GREAT. Its too bad they are trying to rape all the fans by charging an insane price. I also enjoy the fact that it comes in such a HUGE case. Just one season of farscape takes about just about the same amount of room as THREE seasons of babylon 5. I guess if they are going to charge you that much for the dvd's, they want to put them in a huge box so you feel like you are getting more for your money. Oh and since i mentioned babylon ... the season package of dvd's is not only 1/3 the size, but also about 1/3 less in price as well.

I give the show 5 stars, but only 3 for this product since its overpriced and over-packaged.",1093392000,13,642,3.900763358778626
1877698,5,B000093NOL,"This is the best series and this a great season. I can't wait until they come out with season 4. It is a shame that the Sci-Fi channel was not ""future"" thinking enough to continue with the series. It is one of the most creative shows that they had on and they canceled it. Luckily, they decided to have a mini-series to finish out the lousy way they ended season 4. Hopefully, another channel will pick up this wonderful ensemble and continue with it.",1091232000,6,451,4.380952380952381
1877699,5,B000093NOL,"Season three was easily my favorite season, right in front of the fourth. So many things made me fall in love with the way the writing crew handled everything going on with the characters. The ""Two John's"" idea was probably the coolest thing the series did up to that point, and how it was eventually solved was another great episode.
The final four episodes of the season were probably my favorites, simply because the writers and actors put in everything they had, and even Guy Gross (the series composer) went the extra length to implement some awesome music. While the cliffhanger at the end on the season is my least favorite of the four (it seemed like last-minute writing) the season was 99% great. It was sad to see Lani Tupu leave the show on sreen; I always loved his character.
I strongly recommend the set to any fan of the show, because it showcases everything great about Farscape. Hopefully ADV releases the fourth season sometime early next year.
(Wouldn't it be great if they released it before the mini-series in October? Wishful thinking....)",1088640000,8,1061,4.771739130434782
1877700,3,B000093NOL,"This Rating is based on DVD Quality, not Series Quality
First, I am a huge Farscape fan.  I believe it is the best Science Fiction TV series - and the sci-fi channel was stupid to cancel it.
Now, the only issues I have with this DVD set is the DVD quality.  The sound quality is awful!! In Relativity, it sounds as if the boom-operator was widely swinging his microphone because the sound would decrease suddenly mid-sentence.  I'm not sure if it was technical errors on part of the crew or an issue with the DVD.  I happen to lean towards the later, because at times, the whole soundtrack (music and dialog) will decrease in volume.
Other than sound issues, it's a great DVD",1072569600,2,675,4.463414634146342
1877701,5,B000093NOL,"First, to be clear on what you will find on Volume 3 of Season 3 of ""Farscape,"" it is episodes 5, 6 and 7, not 8 and 9, which are on Volume 4.  At this point in the season the successful attempt to bring Aeryn back from the dead has cost Zhaan her life, and Moya's crew now has to carry out without the blue skinned priestess:
Episode 5, ""... Different Destinations"" (Written by Steve Worland, First Aired April 13, 2001) is one of the most emotionally devastating ""Farscape"" episodes ever, which is really saying something.  While visiting a memorial that honors the peace treaty made between the Peacekeepers and the Venek Horde a temporal rift opens and Crichton, Aeryn, D'Argo and Jool are pulled back in time to when the monastary was the scene of the great siege.  As they try to stay alive and get back to their own time, Crichton and the others realize that every thing they do is changing the course of history, with profound effects (which the rest of the crew on Moya in the ""present"" can see as the planet below them changes).  Crichton desperately tries to find a way to make everything right again while Aeryn learns the truth about a famous Peacekeeper hero and D'Argo befriends a young girl.  Far warning: you will be emotionally drained by the end of this one, a classic example of how great time travel stories can be when written intelligently.  (5+ Wormholes)
""Eat Me"" (Written by Matt Ford, April 20, 2001) finds Crichton, Chaina, D'Argo and Jool landing on an old, diseased Leviathan when their Transport Pod is damaged.  Since the Leviathan wears a Peacekeeper Control Collar the gang is on the lookout for Peacekeepers, but instead all they find are mutant scavengers and Kaarvok, a madman who likes to eat brain matter and who has the power to ""twin"" any living being.  This he does to D'Argo, Chaina, and Crichton.  Meanwhile, Aeryn, Rygel and Stark discover a beaten and battered Talyn drifting through space, along with an unconscious Crais.  At first this seems like a ""road not taken"" episode where the crew encounters a Leviathan carrying their less fortunate counterparts.  But ""Eat Me"" ends with what ends up being the most significant plot develop during Season 3.  (5 Wormholes)
""Thanks For Sharing"" (Written by Clayvon C. Harris, First Aired June 15, 2001) has Crichton going crazy trying to figure out which one of him is the original and which the clone.  Meanwhile, when D'Argo, Chiana and Rygel head down to Kanvia to pick up some Chromextin, a healing drug for the ailing Talyn, they become embroiled in local politics.  Then there is the bombshell that Crais drops on Aeryn regarding her mother and the circumstances of her conception.  The news is rather pertinent because it is Xhalax Sun that is commanding the Peacekeeper Retrieval Squad that attacked Talyn.  Consequently, there are a whole lot of ""to be continued"" elements for Season 3 introduced in this episode.  (4 Wormholes)
This is one of the stellar discs in the ""Farscape"" collection.  The first episode is an absolute classic, and the other two are pivotal in establishing the major story arc of Season 3, which explored the themes of separation and death in some depth.",1067817600,2,3177,4.766423357664234
1877702,4,B000093NOL,"Well, trying to explain what has come before this volume for the novice and uninitiated is next to pointless, but for those in the know, this is another solid collection of episodes from the shows' third season.  ""Relativity"" deals with tough-chick Aeryn Sun and her serious quandry of her mother being sent by ther Peacekeepers to bring our heroes in.  The solution is not pretty and one that comes back to haunt her later on in the season.  ""Incubator"" is a chilling tale of bad-guy Scorpius' past, and boy, it's not one easily forgotten.  ""Meltdown"" involves our heroes getting dragged towards a sun by a bizarre force.  ""Scratch N' Sniff"" is easily one of the more bizarre episodes of the show, involving a bickering crew and a shore leave gone horribly awry.  It's a welcome lighthearted trip from the gloom and drama that fills this set, but the whole collection is still good.  Recommended (unless your new, then I recommend checking out the show from the beginning).",1056844800,22,974,4.796407185628743

I'm quite impressed with how Cinedigm handled the upscaling and deinterlacing in its transfer from the original source. Now, some interlacing is still visible in some fast paced moments (especially noticeable in the animated segments from ""Revenging Angel""), but in other fast paced moments (like flying through the wormhole in ""Into the Lions Den Pt. 2"") you'd wonder if they were ever there in the first place. All the bonus material from the earlier releases were also present.

All in all I highly recommend this.. Now all we need is a proper blu-ray transfer of Peacekeeper Wars. C'mon Cinedigm, get on that.",1494892800,,692,4.80672268907563
