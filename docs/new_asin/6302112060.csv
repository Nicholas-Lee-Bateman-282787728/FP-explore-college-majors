Even though changes in my life had someething to do with it, I later regretted doing it. I was 11 years old when this movie came out in '46, but this is my first viewing of it at age 76. It totally grabbed my heart & brought tears to my eyes.",1334880000,35,400,3.950617283950617
423617,5,6302112060,"I was born in 1946....the year of this film and first saw it in those early days of television when they started showing films on networks late at night. I always loved classical music....the piano, in specific and to this day Rubenstein remains the greatest ever.  Philip Dorn is perfect in his role and Catherine a vision. I loved this movie at about the age of ten and I have searched and searched for it....FINALLY I have a copy  ( per Amazon) and can watch it over and over to my delight. No one shows it anymore ....not even TCM! It is so romantic..so musically gratifying and beautiful to look at. I  wish it would find it's way to DVD but alas I am doubtful.

423620,5,6302112060,"Okay, that rating may be a little indulgent. But this is truly one of my favorite films. It's a lavish ($2 million budget--quite an amount for 1946!), colorful romance set against the world of classical music.  Catherine McLeod plays a young student who becomes the protegee of Philip  Dorn, an imperious pianist/conductor. McLeod steadily grows in her  performing ability--and her love for Dorn--until she becomes a little bit  TOO good for his masculine ego. And there is also a third point of this  romantic triangle--McLeod's childhood sweetheart, William Carter--waiting  in the wings. . .  It may be too easy today to make fun of classic  Hollywood romantic contrivances. But I've Always Loved You contains some  true narrative surprises, along with the sense of compassionate,  transcendent love that always marked director Frank Borzage's work. This  was the first of three films Borzage made under contract to Republic; I've  seen only two of the three (this one and Moonrise), and both are among the  best films of his long career. His leading lady here, McLeod, was playing  her first leading role (which is evident from her uneven performance, which  improves as the film goes along). Sadly, she never became a major Hollywood  ""name.""  If you enjoy classic Hollywood  romances/""women's films,"" give I've Always Loved You a try. You  won't be disappointed!",960854400,18,1368,5.164383561643835

Myra Hassman is a young pianist in Philadelphia who's taken on as a protege of Maestro Goronoff. She falls in love with him, but he becomes jealous when she outshines him during their performance of Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto. After Goronoff severs their relationship, she marries her childhood friend, George, who is well aware of her love for the Maestro.

The film has a peculiar quality to it with pastel colors out of a storybook. Much of it feels like a dream, which is how Myra Hassman perceives Goronoff and his bohemian artist's lifestyle. He jets off to Paris, Prague, London, and South America whenever he wants. He lives in palaces and appears to be Prince Charming to countless Cinderellas. He poses, seduces, and moves on. None of it is real. The only thing that is important to him is music.

All the musical sequences were wonderful, especially the musical performance in Carnegie Hall where their relationship played out simultaneously. I also loved Grandmother Goronoff (Maria Ouspenskaya) who brings wisdom and humor to the story and almost steals the film.

We're given a happy ending where Myra chooses to leave the stage and embrace her loyal husband, George. It's true that she's built a life with George and her now-grown daughter, Porgy, for 20 years. However, I wasn't convinced. I still felt a distance between George and Myra and could easily see Myra choosing to live with the Maestro, who appears to have learned his lesson through time and experience.",1455580800,,1503,4.9760956175298805

name"".  This movie made me want to continue studying and to become a concert pianist.  I went on to win several piano contests, but
due to ""fate"" and other circumstances never made the concert career.  Nevertheless, this movie remains a favorite and always reminds
me of why I am still a pianist.  Arthur Rubenstein is the pianist, but the matching of the actor's fingers with the music is wonderful.

In this movie it was played so well (Rubinstein) and so often that 40's audiences started to notice this wonderful piece.  I am so pleased that I could revisit this ""pantheon of memories"" that jibed with what I was doing those days of my youth: practicing the piano, and feed the impossible dreams to become a concert pianist which at 78 is still out of reach.
This movie has a ""sacred meaning"" for me and I plan to go back to it often.  For me It fits into the category of ""lost and unachieved dreams"" and this makes the emotionality of this movie even more relevant.  Ah, my youth!",1414886400,6,740,4.492537313432836

424048,5,6302112060,"1. Beautiful music, beautiful piano playing, beautiful God-given talent.
2. In today's day and age, where people 'fall in and out of love,' the main love story theme shows the value of being best friends in a marriage, not just meeting someone and feeling the 'attraction' feelings. So many people meet a person and feel attracted and jump into a relationship before they even truly know the person, then if they get married, they may find out they really didn't marry the person they thought they did. In the main love story theme of this movie, the man and woman have truly known each other for many years, she has shared her deepest dreams with him without even having/recognizing a 'romantic attraction' for him, they are truly best friends before marriage.
3. The main character at one point has strong romantic feelings for the other man, before she is married. This movie shows true commitment to marriage and one's vows to each other and before God. She had ample opportunity to cheat on her husband with this other man. This other man would have kissed her if she had not turned her head. She was faithful to God and to her husband.
4. This movie pays tribute to God in many ways, including the aforementioned, and also several references to God (for example when she prays and asks God's help).
All in all, I want to share this video with all my friends and family of any age!",1402272000,13,1386,4.592741935483871

The technicolor is wonderful and really adds an excellent touch  - the clothes and wardrobe, hairstyles, the sets of that era now gone (post war).  Definitely a movie made in Hollywood during  it's heyday.  If you appreciate classical music, the movie soundtrack is worth watching.  Katherine McLeod does a fairly decent job of 'playing' the piano to match the actual notes....it must have required a lot of practice.  I remember seeing this movie in the late 50's and in the 60's growing up at home watching it on TV (late night movie) with my mother (who played piano quite well).  When it no longer aired on TV, I spent several years trying to find it to no avail.  I was thrilled to see the video (which I purchased) a few years ago.  I would love to see it on DVD , but I'm not holding my breath.  You can view excellent quality on Amazon Prime!",1395878400,2,959,4.361581920903955

As I watched this and was swept up by the story - and the music - I felt I was watching that movie. The music is indeed beautiful, played by master and mistress and mirrors the strong emotions throughout - the love for creating music, the love of a young woman for a man, the love of a young man for a woman. We should all have such love, the one that rules you by day and by night. This story explores the depth of such love, its counterfeit and its effect upon 5 different people over several years. Like all good movies, you live those emotions for a short time with the characters and experience the culmination of them. Women of all ages wishing for that kind of love will be caught up in this movie. Husbands or boyfriends may watch it to please the one they love. Music lovers will delight in the beauty and grace and yes, passion, displayed by the artists and the songs they play throughout. I never tell the story in my reviews.
