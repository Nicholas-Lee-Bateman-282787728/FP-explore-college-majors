8475675,3,B001TAFBBS,Do not buy this movie for a plot line.  It is more about ego and the girls walking around.  The women are very pretty and natural.  Buy it only if you want to see shots of women who look natural.  I think this was the first movie in this series and a bit less contrived than more current ones.,1321056000,3,293,3.9152542372881354
