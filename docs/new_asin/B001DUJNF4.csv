8294983,4,B001DUJNF4,"If you are looking for a set of videos covering the history of aviation,then my advice is keep looking.
Whilst it is certainly a comprehensive collection of historic video thanks to  NARA in Washington DC (the National Archives and Records Administration) and contains much of interest to any aviation fan,the set's title and blurb on the box is basically downright misleading.
The text on the box talks about ""jumbo jets circling the globe"" and admits that ""the aiplane has been adapted for a variety of uses,for civilian and military transport(ation),for aid,rescue and emegency transport and for the sheer joy of soaring into the heavens"", which  to me says that it covers all aspects of aviation
It continues.""On the darker side the entire world has witnessed the destructive power of military aviation""
However the powers that be at NARA have obviously concluded that the entire history of aviation comprises this darker side because, except for great 1909 archive footage of Orville Wright demonstrating his first military aeroplane and waiting for his miltary ""passenger"" to get comfortable, the only aspects of aviation covered in this otherwise splendid set of DVDs is military whilst completely ignoring any other use of aeroplanes. This all rather strange because I would have thought that the majority of aircraft built in 100 years have been airliner and private or business aircraft and surely there are many most important events and achievements that are completely ignored or perhaps NARA have no videos of people like Charles Lindberg,Alcock and Brown,Juan Trip, Howard Hughes to name a few obvious notables in the overall history of aviation.",1239580800,11,1661,5.2406015037593985
