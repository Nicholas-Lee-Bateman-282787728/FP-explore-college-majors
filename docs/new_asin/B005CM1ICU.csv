4653643,5,B005CM1ICU,the dialog is witty...scarcastic..and perverse...actors..everyone is A+..who ever the casting agent was did a phenominal job...one of my all time faves!!!! and of course seeing Betty White in full battle gear cursing and dropping F bombs...totally a scream!,1391904000,2,257,5.7894736842105265
4653644,5,B005CM1ICU,A movie where people old and young are eaten by big mean reptiles is quite entertaining and the obvious plot line makes me feel safe.,1367193600,,133,4.36
4653645,4,B005CM1ICU,"I thought Lake Placid 2 was a fun movie. It doesn't bore you, it's entertaining, you do need a sense of humor when viewing this. If you take it very seriously, then yes, it's not going to be good. Take it for what it does on purpose, then it's very enjoyable. I thought as good as the 1st one. I thought the actors did good, for a movie like this. Sadie Bickerman is the ultimate stand out of the film, among entertaining characters. If you enjoyed the first one, this one is similar. I don't think any movie is worse than ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"".",1360108800,3,552,4.266666666666667
4653646,3,B005CM1ICU,"This is an okay movie.  I would label this a B rated movie.  The crocs in the movie are very fake looking.  With more attention paid to the starring actors, ""the crocs"", this could have been a better rated movie.",1321920000,,212,4.25
4653647,2,B005CM1ICU,"This is a very cheesy bad Syfy channel tv monster (crocodile) movie. I couldn't get it to play in my RCA blu-ray player. The player needs to be updated. The directions for updating were a bit misleading- I guess I need to get broadband and a router. It did play on my girlfriend's samsung player. She didn't like this movie. This is a fairly typical Syfy type movie, but a little more R-rated. Don't expect great or even decent special effects. Don't expect stars from the original Lake Placid. The acting is a little uneven. John Schneider is decent. Cloris Leachman hams up her role. Leachman's character feeds the crocodiles who grow and start eating people. Most of the young people are OK. The photography is good. The colors are good. The script should have been better. If you are a Syfy tv fan with low expectations you might find this movie to be mildly entertaining. There are actually worse Syfy movies! (faint praise I know!) If you are not a fan of Syfy tv movies you won't like this.  This is the kind of movie that is fun to make fun of - what dumdum will be eaten next? But watching this movie may lower your IQ. Thanks",1319155200,,1135,4.430622009569378
8465664,5,B005CM1ICU,I have no idea why but this is my favorite lake placid movie. It's cheesy. It's poorly acted. It's alot of fun.,1492732800,,111,4.090909090909091

8465667,1,B005CM1ICU,"Very badly made on every level. Makes the original Lake Placid look like Citizen Cane. In particular the sound quality is so bad it left me with
a headache twenty minutes in. The cating was just as bad",1451347200,3,201,4.315789473684211
8465668,2,B005CM1ICU,"I loved the first one! It was funny and a bit silly, but Bridget Fonda was awesome in her role and the writing was outstanding for this kind of comedy. I wtch it over and over when nothing is on tv.

This one was a waste of my money. The soryline was truly ridiculous and the writing/plot was awful. Then they put John Schneider in the role of Sheriiff? He acted like he couldn't find his rearend with both hands..but then that was his assigned role I guess. I found no humor whatsoever in this movie. I will not be buying number three.",1446595200,2,536,4.203883495145631
