5889425,2,B00E44EZBI,"Decent story, but too many dumb parts. For example, why didn't the dad speak up way in the beginning when he saw the muddy boot prints in the front yard? Then, Jamie Kennedy shows up at the daughter's school with her missing necklace, and she stupidly keeps from her parents that the wacko who refused to vacate the property because he insisted it was his, ""found"" it for her. And let's not talk about the dad who discovered that the wacko knew about all the strange events going on, but NEVER told the police when he got arrrsted for punching Jamie Kennedy at the bar. Instead, he tells his dad in law.....the last person who would believe him. Good thing the dad in law trusted him, but he should have at least told the cops and/ or a lawyer first, and had cops to go check out the home. Very stupidly put together.",1393113600,2,817,4.34640522875817
5889426,3,B00E44EZBI,This movie was okay.  I did have my girls watch it because of how the person pertained to me a young student when in fact he was a grown up.  It was very suspenseful but in my opinion it was missing something.,1382313600,,209,3.9523809523809526
5889427,2,B00E44EZBI,"The film is not as ominous as the cover. This is a brightly lit suburban home, not something isolated in the woods. The family moves in while the former resident (Jamie Kennedy) stays in a secret basement room having access to their home, learning their secrets and causing a rift between family members. This film has a brief element of voyeurism. It is a slow developing semi-home break-in movie.

I thought the acting was superior to most Asylum features. The psychological damage inflicted by former owner Forest was well done. Unfortunately the writers couldn't bring it home. At times I thought I was watching a ""Lifetime"" film.

The opening line was ""based on true events"" although there was nothing in the extras about said event. Marlee Matlin, who is deaf in real life, plays the wife who is also deaf. The film uses sign language whenever she is on the screen. Christina DeRosa plays the daughter Christine so I guess it is based on ""true events."" The extras included a ""Gag Reel"" which was short and not worth watching either.

This might work as a cheap rental. It is Asylum. Don't expect David Hess, although Jamie Kennedy was effective.

5889428,3,B00E44EZBI,"A typical thriller from the reliable people at Lifetime. This is a fair offering of a fractured family (the father is a recovering alcoholic) who are in dire need of a cheap house. They find one in the form of a foreclosure that comes with an unhinged sociopath who really, really isn't ready to vacate his childhood home. Marlee Matlin turns in a strong, if somewhat detached performance as the long-suffering wife with trust issues, James Denton (from Desperate Housewives) as the husband who can't catch a break, and an annoying teenager who whines about how she doesn't have any friends. Yawn. There's a few surprises in this one, Ernest Thomas (a.k.a. as Raj from What's Happening!) and Paul Sorvino as Marlee's dad add welcome relief from the cookie-cutter plot. Jamie Kennedy turns in the creepiest performance I've seen as the disheveled owner who wants his house back and will stop at nothing to get it back. Good for a Saturday night viewing. I wouldn't watch it more than once, though it does offer suspense and a few genuine scares or two. On a side note, I found the mocking of Marlee Matlin's slur by Jamie Kennedy's villain very disturbing, more so than the entire movie itself. I know the guy is supposed to be unhinged out of his mind and he's supposed to be rotten but come on! Why is it acceptable to mock the deaf chick? I wouldn't waste the money on a rental..try to catch it on t.v. for free. Three stars and that's just for Marlee.",1380240000,6,1454,4.596153846153846

5889432,2,B00E44EZBI,"This is exactly like a made for TV movie. Its not the worst thing I've seen but it certainly isn't the best thing either. The only reason I got all the way to the end of it was I was doing something else & it was just playing in the background. It was hard for me to accept Jamie Kennedy as the villian. I think Ive seen him in only comedic roles & that made it difficult to think of him as anything but a comedian. This is not a horror or even a thriller movie. The only thing I felt was scary was the fact that its based on a true story. That being said, its predictable and had I had to pay to see it I would be thinking, what a waste of money. Seeing it for free on Prime I can at least avoid that disappointment and walk away from it saying, ""well there's an hour in a half of my life I'm not getting back!

5889433,3,B00E44EZBI,"Why do movies on these budgets think it's so important to have a musical score even if they can't afford a good one? Seriously, if you can't afford a real score then it should not be in the movie. This was a decent flick but the music is in the way.  It happens all the time in low through medium budget movies which is a shame because many of them would be a lot more watchable without an obnoxious score.  Bad music can really ruin the viewing experience. .",1526688000,,459,4.146067415730337

5889435,3,B00E44EZBI,"to many things not making sense to make this a good film.  Weird things started happening and the dad did not respond to it by any common sense reasoning.  The daughter was approached by the madman on the sidewalk and never told her parents and did not stop him from touching her, no one warned the wife about the madman's crazy things that were found out, etc. etc. etc.  Not worth the watch.",1524960000,,393,4.3561643835616435
5889436,3,B00E44EZBI,"This is a tv movie ""based on true events,"" it said.  For this to happen to someone, this is a super creepy and sad situation.  Unbelievable that someone would be so crazy to go through so much work to try to get back his childhood home and to hurt/kill so many people when he did nothing to deserve the house.  The house belonged to his mother, but his mother chose to keep him off the deed and will, and chose to give her assets away to charity and left nothing to her son.  According to the lawyer, the mother purposely foreclosed the home and gave it to the bank, so it's not like the bank took it away from the mother.  In addition, according to the neighbor, the mother did not want the son in the house and asked him to leave many times, but the son refused to leave.  The new family that owns the home is innocent as they bought the home not knowing all the madness that the home had.

Lots of big tv stars in this movie, but some things didn't seem believable in its directing/casting/script.  For example, Jamie Kennedy was a surprise as he played the villain in this movie (he's normally a comedian), but his role here includes faking as a high school student and his voice over the phone/tablet didn't sound anything like a high school kid.  I don't see how the daughter couldn't figure out that it's not a high school kid at the other end of the line.  However, Jamie did fine in looking and behaving like a mad man.  When the daughter escaped the house after her mother helped her find a way out of the house, why would the daughter run down the street screaming only to get caught again?  When the husband found out that the mad man knew everything that was going on with the family after they met over lunch, why didn't he call home to tell his wife right away about his suspicion knowing that his wife threatened divorce due to her mistakenly thinking he's been the problem?  Why would the daughter not tell her mother she was approached by the madman in front of the school?  Lots of things didn't make any sense, but the story overall was intriguing knowing that this happened to someone in real life.",1522627200,,2119,4.345177664974619

5889442,4,B00E44EZBI,"4closed is more of a creepy movie than a scary horror movie.  Fans of Seinfeld will enjoy seeing the lineswoman/lipreader with Marlee Martin in a main role as the mother of a family moving into a new house that they got for a bargain, since it was being sold by the bank after foreclosure. As will fans of Desperate Housewives who get to see Mike (James Denton) as the ex alcoholic husband and father.  This is basically the tale of a mentally disabled man who refuses to accept the fact that his deceased mother's house, which he lived in all his life, no longer belongs to him.  He decides to take out his vengeance on the new owners by observing them and messing with their lives.

Like most horror movies the victim characters do some really stupid things, fail to do something obvious and don't catch on to what is happening for ridiculously unrealistic time. Usually when you purchase a house you get it inspected for pests, structural integrity, to see if any work is not up to code, no additions have been built that didn't go through the local council and a heap of other thing before you hand over your money. If any of these things were done the hidden cameras, and other secrets of the house would have been revealed there and then.  Even the minor characters, we start off with a real estate agent noticing the door is wide open and instead of at the very least asking a neighbour or someone in the street to accompany her inside, let alone calling the cops she just goes inside herself.",1448755200,,1500,4.47985347985348

5889446,4,B00E44EZBI,"It was just great to see Jamie Kennedy FINALLY play a psychopathic character; I'm so used to him being the one pursued BY a psychopath (Scream franchise). I notice he is starting to play more serious characters now, but with him being J.K., you know there is going to be some level of goofiness, and I like that! He still manages to stay true to himself even when playing a darker persona. I just wish the encounter between Forrest and Christine would have gone further; that REALLY would have put a twist on the story!

5889447,4,B00E44EZBI,"Good, solid Cape Fear scaled down a notch or two and, of course, based on true events, which, except in the case of Hidden in the Woods, means lower your expectations in my book. Marlee Matlin brings her usual excellence plus some real athletic oomph, and the girl played her daughter is SMOKING HOT! Dad played a good outrage. Nice turn by the villain, lots of slacker hate backed up by a moving sincerity. Audio levels leave something to be desired. I find it ironic that this Marlee Matlin vehicle, a far better story of a deaf protagonist in a horror situation than Casadaga, does not have subtitles or cc.

Big mistake.  The film was very disappointing.  The movie was half about a nut case trying to get his house back while the other half of the film was an over-the-top melodrama concerning family dynamics..  Even the acting was bad by the lead female actress.  I really don't know how people could rate this movie so high.  Even if it was lifetime flick I would have turned it off.
