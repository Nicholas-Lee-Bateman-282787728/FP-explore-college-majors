8299401,1,B001ERFR06,This is a good film with excellent actors but theDVD I bought is an EXTREMELY  bad copy of a poor VHS copy. The sound track is atrocious and the image is extremely blurry. The subtitles of this german film are impossible to read. Luckily my german is good enough for me to be able to understand what is happening. It is time for some recording companies to remaster the film. It would be worth it as it is a classic based on one of Thomas Mann's most famous short-stories,1371945600,2,471,4.292134831460674
