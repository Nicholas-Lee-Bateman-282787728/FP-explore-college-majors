8223589,1,B000R343OE,"I bought this video for my 19 month old grandaughter who loves ""In the Night Garden."" She can tell you every character and what they do. She was so excited to have her very own ""Makka Pakka"" video (her favorite character). But when we sat her down and loaded the video - guess what? Couldn't play on our dvd player. It was not formatted for USA players, as I had believed. So it is useless to us and a great disappointment.",1310601600,2,423,4.234567901234568
8223590,1,B000R343OE,"We received this a gift...... the person that bought it read the description that the dvd was NTSC. IT'S NOT, WE RECEIVED A PAL ONE. Then contacted amazon, they said, no thats a mistake.... all dvds bought on us site are NTSC we'll send you another one, guess what still PAL........ Congrats amazon, for paying attention to detail!!!",1222646400,4,333,4.758620689655173
8223591,5,B000R343OE,"This is a great DVD for the kids to watch, our 1-year-old son is glued to it for a whole episode.  Unfortunately, contrary to the statement, it is not NTSC (which implies USA region 1) but PAL (region 2).  It's okay if you have a multi-region dvd player, but completely useless otherwise :(",1212192000,8,290,4.452830188679245
