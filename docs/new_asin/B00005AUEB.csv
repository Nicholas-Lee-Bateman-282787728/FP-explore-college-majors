i say its 4+1/2 stars
the lucha libre match gets 3+1/2 stars they seemed somewhat hesitant
D vs. Rizzanno vs. Juvi is great plus buddy rose gets dumped on his head. 4 stars
Pogo vs. Carlos [was not good]but its like 1+1/2 minutes so it doesn't matter
Franchise vs. Candido starts out slow then Sabu comes and makes it a decent match. Few tables typical Sabu stuff. 4 stars just cuz Sabu and the Franchise rule.
all in all a good tape that is mostly wrestling would of been 5 stars if they fired Larry Rivera.",1029715200,,573,4.314814814814815

I'm not an XPW fan at all, but with names like sabu, the franchise, chris-tammy, it wasn't all that bad, its still no way close to ECW titles but if you already have all of them like me this will do you over until the next two ECW titles come out....",995673600,,330,4.15625
