3872190,5,B00289T818,"Truly a remarkable artist who skillfully renders the subject with subtlety of color and value. He is amazing at illustrating the subject matter. His work is like shorthand, but it is so expressive and accurate. You have to have complete control over your craft in order to achieve this level of competence.",1379635200,8,306,4.903846153846154
3872191,5,B00289T818,"Joseph Zbukvic is an incredible painter and truly gives himself over to the paint. When one paints watercolor, they need to allow the paint to do the work. Zbukvic is a master at this. Truly worth investing in.",1368230400,2,210,4.552631578947368
3872192,5,B00289T818,"If you're a fan of John Singer Sergeant's watercolors, this is a painter who captures that essence. He's a master draftsman and it shows in his fluid watercolors. Not for beginners who are looking for a how to beginner's guide.",1366156800,2,227,4.7
3872193,5,B00289T818,"Perhaps one of the best watercolor painters alive today...Book is only out shadowed by his wonderful DVDs.... I recommend anything in print or DVD of his,  to purchase, if you are a serious WC painter.",1357344000,20,201,4.742857142857143
3872194,5,B00289T818,"Many years ago I bought Joseph Zbukvic's book ""Mastering Atmosphere & Mood in Watercolor"" because I liked his paintings and I've always been glad that I did.  I learned a great deal from it that I have put to good use in my own watercolors.  Yet I wanted to actually see him paint.  In this DVD, it's apparent that he practices what he teaches in his book; you can see it in his movements with the brush and paint-to-water proportions.  He has a comfortable verbal delivery, now and again tossing in a funny remark, sometimes about himself.  It's like having an old friend talking to me.",1313884800,28,587,4.5
3872195,5,B00289T818,"Joseph Zbukvic is an excellent instructor, is clear and consistent, and is an impressive watercolor artist.  His workshops fill up fast, with long waiting lists. This instructional DVD may be a good fallback, especially since you can watch the DVD as often as you need to. When it comes to watercolor painting, everyone has their own style and taste.  His style is like the cover of this DVD -- a lot of grays and touches of color here and there, and he really uses the water to great effect.  You can watch previews of art videos on YouTube or elsewhere to help you decide which teacher might be best for your particular taste. If you like Zbukvic's art, then I believe you'll be very happy with this DVD.  (Make sure you're buying the right format for your country.)",1428710400,3,768,4.543478260869565
3872196,5,B00289T818,Enjoy watching the master at work at my own home.,1414713600,,49,4.0
3872197,5,B00289T818,"I've enjoyed a few Joseph Zbukvic's short videos on YouTube so I decided to buy this DVD.  His work is masterful and beautiful, start to finish.  This DVD would be of considerable less value to me if I didn't have a few years of watercolor painting behind me.  For a beginner, this is absolutely not the first video to spend money on.  He makes virtually NO mention of materials or tools, but demonstrates how capable he is with all of them.  If you already know the basics and don't need to be told what materials to use, these demonstrations will be of great value.  If you need more basic instruction I'd recommend Robert Wade's books and DVD (especially his ""Workshop"" material).",1410912000,5,683,4.603305785123967
3872198,5,B00289T818,"Not for the beginner. If you want to learn what watercolors, brushes, papers and techniques to use, try Tony Couch or other good  instructors. This DVD is great for pro and/or serious watercolor painters who want to watch a master at work.",1409011200,,239,4.690476190476191
3872199,5,B00289T818,Watching a master at work is so helpful as far a studying techniques.  And the evolution of the paintings is wonderful.  It's as if he does in with magic.  You will not be disappointed watching this man work.,1403913600,,208,4.421052631578948
3872200,4,B00289T818,"Very enjoyable approach to watercolor in a ""loose approach to painting. Zbukvic demonstrates his method very clearly. I really enjoyed this DVD.",1398038400,,144,5.590909090909091
3872201,5,B00289T818,"If you're looking for someone who goes into detail about every little thing like what color or shade he's using, or what type of paper and why. Or what this brush or that brush is good for and what each stroke means or does and how it affects the overall painting. Or perfectly capturing the nuances and exact perspective of each building or structure he paints while depicting every single, color with complete accuracy ... Mr. Zbukvic is most definitely not your man.

Apparently, none of that means a thing to him. He only cares about making beautiful, spirited, interesting paintings. And he does, right before your eyes. With a palette that looks like a soupy, muddy mess which he refers to as ""debris"" or ""muck"" with ""purply-greenish"" shadows (or something like that.) Instead of color, he seems to think more in terms of warmer or cooler, here or there, to make something recede or come forward.

Two of my favorite quotes were: ""a watercolor will paint itself - just let it.""

And ... ""any mistake is a gift.""

I have to say that Mr Zbukvic has completely and effortlessly destroyed my notion of what a master watercolorist was all about - and I""m so thankful he did.

Buy this DVD. Quit fussing and worrying over your work and start painting with expressive, decisive, un-labored strokes. Your work will improve immediately :)",1393804800,19,1335,4.737068965517241
3872202,4,B00289T818,Shows artist painting a variety of scenes.  For the most part you see the work from start to finish without gaps in the painting process so you can see exactly how the painting was done.  Friendly and fun to watch. Doesn't give you names of colors used which to me is not necessary.  Also doesn't point out his brushes. But I've enjoy watching it many times.,1393545600,9,358,4.393939393939394
3872203,5,B00289T818,"Simply beautiful and inspiring. High quality, prompt service and delivery.  Excellent dvd for an aspiring watercolorist. Zbukvic is an outstanding painter and consistent in his work.",1387497600,6,182,6.0
3872204,5,B00289T818,"Joseph de-mystifies the process of painting a watercolour work of art. I have not spent very much time actually painting, blocked by not knowing what I am doing. Now I have a much clearer conception of how to paint in watercolour. Thanks Joseph.",1381017600,10,245,4.72093023255814
8355993,5,B00289T818,Love this video by Zbukvic and have watched many times.  He's great and fun to watch.,1515715200,,85,4.3125
8355994,5,B00289T818,"Zbukvic is an outstanding self-made artist with a loose and free style of painting watercolor that is amazing. His paintings tell a story in a relaxed, casual manner that is captivating. He doesn't labor over details; his attention is focused on color and impressions. And how he puts it all together is pure genius.",1490054400,,316,4.87037037037037

8355998,4,B00289T818,"Great info for the watercolorist, I bought this because his book was way too expensive. But he does not lecture the book, in that its just watching him paint although he does give advise while painting.",1435449600,,202,4.638888888888889
8355999,5,B00289T818,"Love this DVD!  Watching Mr. Zbukvic paint is like watching a magician do his magic all the while explaining how it is done. He offers very good advice about plein air painting such as sticking with your original vision when the scene changes and not worrying about the outcome while you are painting. If you are thinking about tackling watercolor, or have been frustrated by it, this is a great learning tool.  I highly recommend this video!",1433721600,,442,4.7272727272727275
8356000,5,B00289T818,One has everything to gain by studying Joseph Zbukvic Watercolour Impressions DVD. Owning this DVD allows me to play this repeatedly and stop it as I work along with him. He is a true master of this art form Watercolor. Just beautiful!,1432166400,3,235,4.619047619047619
